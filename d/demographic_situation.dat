A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30% Han and 60% Turkic, while it dramatically shifted to 6% Han and 75% Uyghur in the 1953 census, however by 2000 the recorded population was 40.57% Han and 45.21% Uyghur. Professor Stanley W. Toops noted that today's <b>demographic</b> <b>situation</b> {{is similar to that of}} the early Qing period in Xinjiang. In northern Xinjiang, the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, and Kazakh colonists after they exterminated the Zunghar Oirat Mongols in the region, with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the north, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin.|$|E

The paper elaborates on findings of empirical investigations conducted within the EU FP 7 project DERREG. It will be shown that differences in effectuating more collaborative modes of governance can partly be ascribed to different political dynamics, economic and <b>demographic</b> <b>situations</b> as well as the presence of a shared sense of place. To raise collective agency effectively requires a joint reconsideration and restructuring of the division of roles and tasks, including those of public administration.

In Dzungaria, the Qing established new cities like Ürümqi and Yining. After the Chinese defeated Jahangir Khoja in the 1820s, 12,000 Turki (Uyghur) Taranchi families were deported by China from the Tarim Basin to Dzungaria to colonize and repopulate the area. The Dzungarian basin, which used to be inhabited by Dzungars, is currently inhabited by Kazakhs.|$|E

Notwithstanding these divergent <b>demographic</b> <b>situations,</b> current and projected changes in the composition and distribution of population in high- and low-income countries alike provide opportunities for strengthening weakened social safety nets, promoting economic sustainability, and improving social integration in cities by adopting development strategies that support intergenerational initiatives. This paper first examines developments related to trends of population aging and discusses patterns and issues associated with youthful populations. It then reviews {{the emergence of a}} normative platform for creating child-friendly cities and argues that their characteristics significantly overlap with elder-friendly cities. Drawing from practical examples of intergenerational initiatives and programs from around the world, the paper identifies benefits and challenges of synergistic efforts to create livable cities for all ages.

25|$|The Depression of the 1930s, {{followed}} by {{the outbreak of the}} Sino-Japanese War, had the effect of ending Chinese emigration to Malaya. This stabilised the <b>demographic</b> <b>situation</b> and ended the prospect of the Malays becoming a minority in their own country. At the time of independence in 1957, Malays comprised 55% of the population, Chinese 35% and Indians 10%. This balance was altered by the inclusion of the majority-Chinese Singapore, upsetting many Malays. The federation increased the Chinese proportion to close to 40%. Both UMNO and the MCA were nervous about the possible appeal of Lee's People's Action Party (then seen as a radical socialist party) to voters in Malaya, and tried to organise a party in Singapore to challenge Lee's position there. Lee in turn threatened to run PAP candidates in Malaya at the 1964 federal elections, despite an earlier agreement that he would not do so (see PAP-UMNO Relations). Racial tensions intensified as PAP created an opposition alliance aiming for equality between races. This provoked Tunku Abdul Rahman to demand that Singapore withdraw from Malaysia.

Since the middle of the 19 th century a number of toponyms of Greek, Russian, Armenian and other origins appeared in the territory of present-day Abkhazia.

2500|$|The Qing began {{a process}} of {{settling}} Han, Hui, and Uyghur settlers into Northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria) starting in the 18th century. At {{the start of the}} 19th century, 40 years after the Qing reconquest, there were around 155,000 Han and Hui Chinese in northern Xinjiang and somewhat more than twice that number of Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang. A census of Xinjiang under Qing rule in the early 19th century tabulated ethnic shares of the population as 30% Han and 60% Turkic, while it dramatically shifted to 6% Han and 75% Uyghur in the 1953 census. However, a situation similar to the Qing era-demographics with a large number of Han had been restored by 2000 with 40.57% Han and 45.21% Uyghur. Professor Stanley W. Toops noted that today's <b>demographic</b> <b>situation</b> {{is similar to that of}} the early Qing period in Xinjiang. Before 1831, only a few hundred Chinese merchants lived in southern Xinjiang oases (Tarim Basin) and only a few Uyghurs lived in northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria). After 1831 the Qing permitted and encouraged Han Chinese migration into the Tarim basin in southern Xinjiang, although with very little success, and stationed permanent troops on the land there as well. [...] Political killings and expulsions of non Uyghur populations in the uprisings of the 1860s and 1930s saw them experience a sharp decline as a percentage of the total population though they rose once again in the periods of stability following 1880 (which saw Xinjiang increase its population from 1.2 million) and 1949. From a low of 7% in 1953, the Han began to return to Xinjiang between then and 1964, where they comprised 33% of the population (54% Uyghur), similarly to Qing times. A decade later, at the beginning of the Chinese economic reform in 1978, the demographic balance was 46% Uyghur and 40% Han; this has not changed drastically until the last census in 2000, with the Uyghur population reduced to 42%. Military personnel are not counted and national minorities are undercounted in the Chinese census, as in most censuses. While some of the shift has been attributed to an increased Han presence, Uyghurs have also emigrated to other parts of China, where their numbers have increased steadily. Uyghur independence activists express concern over the Han population changing the Uyghur character of the region, though the Han and Hui Chinese mostly live in northern Xinjiang Dzungaria, and are separated from areas of historical Uyghur dominance south of the Tian Shan mountains (southwestern Xinjiang), where Uyghurs account for about 90% of the population.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A central {{premise of}} {{physiological}} ecology {{is that an}} animal's preferred body temperature should correspond closely with the temperature maximizing performance and Darwinian fitness. Testing this co-adaptational hypothesis has been problematic for several reasons. First, reproductive fitness is the appropriate measure, but is difficult to measure in most animals. Second, no single fitness measure applies to all <b>demographic</b> <b>situations,</b> complicating interpretations. Here we test the co-adaptation hypothesis by studying an organism (Caenorhabditis elegans) in which both fitness and thermal preference can be reliably measured. Results We find that natural isolates of C. elegans display a range of mean thermal preferences and also vary in their thermal sensitivities for fitness. Hot-seeking isolates CB 4854 and CB 4857 prefer temperatures that favor population growth rate (r), whereas the cold-seeking isolate CB 4856 prefers temperatures that favor Lifetime Reproductive Success (LRS). Conclusions Correlations between fitness and thermal preference in natural isolates of C. elegans are driven primarily by isolate-specific differences in thermal preference. If these differences {{are the result of}} natural selection, then this suggests that the appropriate measure of fitness for use in evolutionary ecology studies might differ even within species, depending on the unique ecological and evolutionary history of each population. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{new model}} is {{presented}} for the genetic structure among {{a collection of}} island populations, with fluctuating population sizes and continuous overlapping generations, using a stochastic birth, death and immigration (BDI) process. Immigrants enter each island from a large mainland population, with constant gene frequencies, according to a Poisson process. The average probability of identity by descent (IBD) for two haploid individuals randomly selected from an island population is f(0) = (φf(1) + λ) /(φ + λ), where f(1) is the probability of IBD for two randomly selected immigrants, λ is the birth-rate for each individual, and φ is the arrival rate of immigrants into each island. The value of f(0) is independent of the death process, time and N. The expected level of genetic differentiation among island populations is F(ST) = (1 - 1 /n) λ/(φ + λ), where n is {{the total number of}} islands receiving immigrants. Because f(0) and F(ST) are independent of the death process, for a BDI model, the population genetic structure for several general <b>demographic</b> <b>situations</b> may be examined using our equations. These include stochastic exponential, or logistic (regulated by death rate) growth within islands, or a ``source-sink'' population structure. Because the expected values of both f(0) and F(ST) are independent of time, these are achieved immediately, for a BDI model, with no need to assume the island populations are at genetic equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of inversions that capture locally adapted alleles when two populations are exchanging migrants or hybridizing. By suppressing recombination between the loci, a new inversion can spread. Neither drift nor coadaptation between the alleles (epistasis) is needed, so this local adaptation mechanism may apply to {{a broader range of}} genetic and <b>demographic</b> <b>situations</b> than alternative hypotheses that have been widely discussed. The mechanism can explain many features observed in inversion systems. It will drive an inversion to high frequency if there is no countervailing force, which could explain fixed differences observed between populations and species. An inversion can be stabilized at an intermediate frequency if it also happens to capture one or more deleterious recessive mutations, which could explain polymorphisms that are common in some species. This polymorphism can cycle in frequency with the changing selective advantage of the locally favored alleles. The mechanism can establish underdominant inversions that decrease heterokaryotype fitness by several percent if the cause of fitness loss is structural, while if the cause is genic there is no limit to the strength of underdominance that can result. The mechanism is expected to cause loci responsible for adaptive species-specific differences to map to inversions, as seen in recent QTL studies. We discuss data that support the hypothesis, review other mechanisms for inversion evolution, and suggest possible tests...|$|R
