25|$|Traditional {{actuarial science}} and modern <b>financial</b> <b>economics</b> in the US have {{different}} practices, {{which is caused}} by 1) different ways of calculating funding and investment strategies and 2) different regulations.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{actuarial science}} {{developed}} along a different path, becoming more reliant on assumptions, {{as opposed to}} the arbitrage-free risk-neutral valuation concepts used in modern finance. The divergence is not related to the use of historical data and statistical projections of liability cash flows, but is instead caused by the manner in which traditional actuarial methods apply market data with those numbers. For example, one traditional actuarial method suggests that changing the asset allocation mix of investments can change the value of liabilities and assets (by changing the discount rate assumption). This concept is inconsistent with <b>financial</b> <b>economics.</b>|$|E

25|$|Experimental finance aims to {{establish}} different market settings and environments to observe experimentally {{and provide a}} lens through which science can analyze agents' behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows, information diffusion and aggregation, price setting mechanisms, and returns processes. Researchers in experimental finance can study to what extent existing <b>financial</b> <b>economics</b> theory makes valid predictions and therefore prove them, and attempt to discover new principles on which such theory can be extended and be applied to future financial decisions. Research may proceed by conducting trading simulations or by establishing and studying the behavior, {{and the way that}} these people act or react, of people in artificial competitive market-like settings.|$|E
25|$|Economists make {{a number}} of {{abstract}} assumptions for purposes of their analyses and predictions. They generally regard financial markets that function for the financial system as an efficient mechanism (Efficient-market hypothesis). Instead, financial markets are subject to human error and emotion. New research discloses the mischaracterization of investment safety and measures of financial products and markets so complex that their effects, especially under conditions of uncertainty, are impossible to predict. The study of finance is subsumed under economics as <b>financial</b> <b>economics,</b> but the scope, speed, power relations and practices of the financial system can uplift or cripple whole economies and the well-being of households, businesses and governing bodies within them—sometimes in a single day.|$|E
25|$|Actuarial science {{became a}} formal {{mathematical}} {{discipline in the}} late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage such as burial, life insurance, and annuities. These long term coverage required that money be set aside to pay future benefits, such as annuity and death benefits many years into the future. This requires estimating future contingent events, such as the rates of mortality by age, {{as well as the}} development of mathematical techniques for discounting the value of funds set aside and invested. This {{led to the development of}} an important actuarial concept, referred to as the present value of a future sum. Certain aspects of the actuarial methods for discounting pension funds have come under criticism from modern <b>financial</b> <b>economics.</b>|$|E

25|$|As a researcher, Summers {{has made}} {{important}} contributions {{in many areas}} of economics, primarily public finance, labor economics, <b>financial</b> <b>economics,</b> and macroeconomics. Summers has also worked in international economics, economic demography, economic history and development economics. His work generally emphasizes the analysis of empirical economic data in order to answer well-defined questions (for example: Does saving respond to after-tax interest rates? Are the returns from stocks and stock portfolios predictable? Are most of those who receive unemployment benefits only transitorily unemployed? etc.) For his work, he received the John Bates Clark Medal in 1993 from the American Economic Association. In 1987, he was the first social scientist to win the Alan T. Waterman Award from the National Science Foundation. Summers {{is also a member of}} the National Academy of Sciences.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>{{economics}}</b> is {{the branch}} of economics studying the interrelation of financial variables, such as prices, interest rates and shares, as opposed to goods and services. <b>Financial</b> <b>economics</b> concentrates on influences of real economic variables on financial ones, in contrast to pure finance. [...] It centres on managing risk {{in the context of}} the financial markets, and the resultant economic and financial models. [...] It essentially explores how rational investors would apply risk and return to the problem of an investment policy. [...] Here, the twin assumptions of rationality and market efficiency lead to modern portfolio theory (the CAPM), and to the Black–Scholes theory for option valuation; it further studies phenomena and models where these assumptions do not hold, or are extended. [...] "Financial economics", at least formally, also considers investment under [...] "certainty" [...] (Fisher separation theorem, [...] "theory of investment value", Modigliani–Miller theorem) and hence also contributes to corporate finance theory. Financial econometrics is {{the branch of}} <b>financial</b> <b>economics</b> that uses econometric techniques to parameterize the relationships suggested.|$|E
