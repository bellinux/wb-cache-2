5|$|Hurricane Vince {{developed}} into a hurricane farther east than any other known storm, at 18.9°W. The National Hurricane Center declared that Vince was the first tropical cyclone on record to have made landfall on the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> Historical documents, however, suggest that a possibly stronger tropical storm, the 1842 Spain hurricane, struck the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> on 29 October 1842. Vince's record north was broken by Tropical Storm Grace in 2009.|$|E
5|$|As {{domestic}} {{cats are}} little altered from wildcats, they can readily interbreed. This hybridization poses {{a danger to}} the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations, particularly in Scotland and Hungary and possibly also the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|The common {{chiffchaff}} {{has three}} still commonly accepted subspecies, together with {{some from the}} <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> the Canary Islands, and the Caucasus which are now more often treated as full species.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere on the <b>Iberian</b> <b>peninsula,</b> {{almost at}} the same time, Alfonso VII of León, Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona, and others led a mixed army of Catalans, Leonese, Castilians and French crusaders against the rich port city of Almería. With support from a Genoese–Pisan navy, the city was {{occupied}} in October 1147.|$|E
5|$|In Books III to VI, Pliny {{moves to}} the Earth itself. In Book III he covers the {{geography}} of the <b>Iberian</b> <b>peninsula</b> and Italy; Book IV covers Europe including Britain; Book V looks at Africa and Asia, while Book VI looks eastwards to the Black Sea, India and the Far East.|$|E
5|$|Mounted Muslim warriors conquered North Africa and the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> {{during the}} 7th and 8th centuries AD {{following}} the Hegira, or Hijra, of Muhammad in 622 AD. By 630 AD, their influence expanded across the Middle East and into western North Africa. By 711 AD, the light cavalry of Muslim warriors had reached Spain, and controlled {{most of the}} <b>Iberian</b> <b>peninsula</b> by 720. Their mounts were of various oriental types, including the North African Barb. A few Arabian horses may have come with the Ummayads who settled in the Guadalquivir valley. Another strain of horse that came with Islamic invaders was the Turkoman horse. Muslim invaders travelled north from nowadays Spain into France, where they were defeated by the Frankish ruler Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours in 732 AD.|$|E
5|$|Organ cases {{occasionally}} {{feature a}} few ranks of pipes protruding horizontally {{from the case}} {{in the manner of a}} row of trumpets. These are referred to as pipes en chamade and are particularly common in organs of the <b>Iberian</b> <b>peninsula</b> and large 20th-century instruments.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{production of}} steel are pieces of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kalehoyuk) and are nearly 4,000 years old, dating from 1800 BC. Horace identifies steel weapons {{such as the}} falcata in the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> while Noric steel {{was used by the}} Roman military.|$|E
5|$|The {{great auk}} {{was found in}} the cold North Atlantic coastal waters along the coasts of Canada, the northeastern United States, Norway, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Ireland, Great Britain, France, and the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> Pleistocene fossils {{indicate}} the great auk also inhabited Southern France, Italy, and other coasts of the Mediterranean basin.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of the fatwa was limited to Spain. Outside the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> the predominant opinion continued to uphold the unbending requirements of Islamic law and required Muslims to leave any country, or even choose martyrdom, where approved observance of the religion became impossible.|$|E
5|$|Vince made {{landfall}} on the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> near Huelva, Spain on October 11 {{just after}} weakening to a tropical depression. Vince {{was the first}} tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in Spain. No damages or injuries were reported, aside from flooding in some areas.|$|E
5|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} Muslim castles in the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> {{was the use}} of detached towers, called Albarrana towers, around the perimeter as can be seen at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12thcentury, the towers provided flanking fire. They were connected to the castle by removable wooden bridges, so if the towers were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.|$|E
5|$|After {{the last}} ice age only large mammals such as mammoths, bison and woolly {{rhinoceros}} remained. Roughly 11,000years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from {{the northern part of the}} <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|From the {{opposite}} end of Europe (the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula)</b> came the few people who formed during the 2500-1900 BCE period the Bell-Beaker culture. It was named after the shape of their typical, carefully finished and precisely ornamented pottery. Southwestern Poland was at the eastern edge of their range. Because of their mobility, the Bell-Beaker people helped spread new inventions, including developing metallurgy, over large areas of Europe.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there were}} exceptions; in the 7th century a Merovingian kingdom still {{retained}} {{at least one}} active Roman horse breeding centre. The Spanish also retained many quality horses, {{in part due to}} the historic reputation of the region as a horse-breeding land, and partially due to the cultural influences related to the Islamic conquest of the <b>Iberian</b> <b>peninsula</b> between the 8th and 15th centuries.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Iberian</b> <b>peninsula,</b> Crusader {{privileges}} {{were given}} to those aiding the Templars, the Hospitallers, and the Iberian orders that merged with the orders of Calatrava and Santiago. The Christian kingdoms pushed the Muslim Moors and Almohads back in frequent Papal-endorsed Iberian Crusades from 1212 to 1265. The Emirate of Granada held out until 1492, {{at which point the}} Muslims and Jews were finally expelled from the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|P. l. europaea, {{known as}} the European lion, was {{probably}} identical with Panthera leo persica or Panthera leo spelea. It became extinct around 100 AD due to persecution and over-exploitation. It inhabited the Balkans, the Italian Peninsula, southern France, and the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> It was a very popular object of hunting among ancient Romans and Greeks.|$|E
5|$|The Europa Point Lighthouse, also {{referred}} to as the Trinity Lighthouse at Europa Point and the Victoria Tower or La Farola in Llanito, is a lighthouse at Europa Point, on the southeastern tip of the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, on {{the southern end of the}} <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim {{invasion}} of the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> in the 8thcentury introduced a style of building developed in North Africa reliant on tapial, pebbles in cement, where timber was in short supply. Although stone construction would later become common elsewhere, from the 11thcentury onwards it was the primary building material for Christian castles in Spain, {{while at the same}} time timber was still the dominant building material in north-west Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Ocean Village Marina is one {{of three}} marinas in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, at the {{southern}} end of the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> Formerly Sheppard's Marina, it is located in the Bay of Gibraltar, between the North Mole of Gibraltar Harbour and the runway of Gibraltar International Airport. Both Ocean Village Marina and the adjacent Marina Bay have been incorporated into the Ocean Village Project, a luxury resort.|$|E
5|$|The Romans built many {{dams and}} {{reservoirs}} for water collection, {{such as the}} Subiaco Dams, two of which fed the Anio Novus, {{one of the largest}} aqueducts of Rome. They built 72 dams just on the <b>Iberian</b> <b>peninsula,</b> and many more are known across the Empire, some still in use. Several earthen dams are known from Roman Britain, including a well-preserved example from Longovicium (Lanchester).|$|E
5|$|The {{biogeography}} {{demonstrates a}} phylogenetic association, for instance subgenus Hermione having a lowland distribution, but subgenus Narcissus section Apodanthi being montane and restricted to Morocco, Spain and Portugal. The remaining sections within subgenus Narcissus include both lowland and mountain habitats. Section Pseudonarcissus, although widely naturalised is endemic to the Baetic Ranges {{of the south}} eastern <b>Iberian</b> <b>peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game reached Western Europe and Russia by {{at least}} three routes, the {{earliest}} being in the 9thcentury. By the year 1000, it had spread throughout Europe. Introduced into the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> by the Moors in the 10thcentury, it was described in a famous 13th-century manuscript covering shatranj, backgammon, and dice named the Libro de los juegos.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{period of}} castle building in Spain {{was in the}} 11th to 13thcenturies, and they were most commonly found in the disputed borders between Christian and Muslim lands. Conflict and interaction {{between the two groups}} led to an exchange of architectural ideas, and Spanish Christians adopted the use of detached towers. The Spanish Reconquista, driving the Muslims out of the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> was complete in 1492.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} has a {{distribution}} stretching discontinuously across temperate Eurasia from Great Britain and the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> eastwards to western Siberia. The subspecies S. a. mauritanica extends the range into northwest Africa. This essentially non-migratory owl is absent from Ireland (probably because of {{competition from the}} long-eared owl), and only a rare vagrant to the Balearic and Canary Islands.|$|E
5|$|Crested and marbled newts {{are found}} in Eurasia, from Great Britain and the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> {{in the west to}} West Siberia and the {{southern}} Caspian Sea region in the east, and reach north to central Fennoscandia. Overall, the species have contiguous, parapatric ranges; only the northern crested newt and the marbled newt occur sympatrically in western France, and the southern crested newt has a disjunct, allopatric distribution in Crimea, the Caucasus, and south of the Caspian Sea.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} fossil record of bats extends over 50 million years, their fossils are {{extremely}} rare. The fossil record of the greater noctule in the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> suggests that they lived at different geographical locations from that of today. The fossils of greater noctule are almost non-existent prior to the Miocene epoch. The deterioration of the climate {{at the end of}} Neogene led to the disappearance of tropical species and vespertilionids profited by accessing a wider range of habitats.|$|E
5|$|Following the Hijra in AD 622 (also {{sometimes}} spelled Hegira), the Arabian horse {{spread across}} the known world of the time, and became recognized as a distinct, named breed. It {{played a significant role}} in the History of the Middle East and of Islam. By 630, Muslim influence expanded across the Middle East and North Africa, by 711 Muslim warriors had reached Spain, and they controlled most of the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> by 720. Their war horses were of various oriental types, including both Arabians and the Barb horse of North Africa.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania and {{throughout}} the Reconquista, marriage between Spanish and Umayyad royals was not uncommon. Early marriages, such as that of Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa and Egilona {{at the turn of the}} 8th century, was thought to help establish the legitimacy of Muslim rule on the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> Later instances of intermarriage were often made to seal trade treaties between Christian kings and Muslim caliphs.|$|E
5|$|Hyacinthoides non-scripta forms a clade {{with three}} other species – H.hispanica, H.paivae and H.cedretorum – centred on the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> H.paivae is {{restricted}} to a small area of north-western Iberia (Galicia and neighbouring parts of Portugal), while H.cedretorum is found in mountainous areas of western North Africa (Morocco and Algeria). Within Iberia, H.non-scripta and H.hispanica are geographically separated by the Duero river. The genus also contains seven further species, mostly distributed further east in the Mediterranean Basin.|$|E
5|$|In Southern Europe, wolf {{extermination}} was not {{as complete}} as in Northern Europe, because of greater cultural tolerance of the species. Wolf populations only began declining in the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> in the early 19th-century, and was reduced by a half of its original size by 1900. Wolf bounties were regularly paid in Italy as late as 1950. Wolves were exterminated in the Alps by 1800, and numbered only 100 by 1973, inhabiting only 3–5% of their former Italian range.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, Philippine ports {{opened to}} world trade and shifts started {{occurring}} within Filipino society. Many Spaniards {{born in the}} Philippines (criollos) and those of mixed ancestry (mestizos) became wealthy and an influx of Latin American immigrants opened up government positions traditionally held by Spaniards born in the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> (peninsulares). The ideals of revolution also began to spread through the islands. Criollo dissatisfaction resulted in the 1872 Cavite Mutiny that was a precursor to the Philippine Revolution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the time}} of Nero, {{senators}} were still primarily from Rome {{and other parts of}} Italy, with some from the <b>Iberian</b> <b>peninsula</b> and southern France; men from the Greek-speaking provinces of the East began to be added under Vespasian. The first senator from the most eastern province, Cappadocia, was admitted under Marcus Aurelius. By {{the time of}} the Severan dynasty (193–235), Italians made up less than half the Senate. During the 3rd century, domicile at Rome became impractical, and inscriptions attest to senators who were active in politics and munificence in their homeland (patria).|$|E
5|$|Most Egyptian {{vultures}} in the subtropical zone of Europe migrate {{south to}} Africa in winter. Like many other large soaring migrants, they avoid making long crossings over water. Italian birds cross over through Sicily and into Tunisia making short sea crossings by {{passing through the}} islands of Marettimo and Pantelleria. Those that migrate through the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula</b> cross into Africa over the Strait of Gibraltar while others cross further east through the Levant. In summer, some African birds fly further north into Europe and vagrants have been recorded in England and southern Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Narcissus {{appears to}} have arisen {{in the area of}} the <b>Iberian</b> <b>peninsula,</b> {{southern}} France and north-western Italy, and within this area most sections of the genus appeared, with only a few taxa being dispersed to North Africa at a time when the African and West European platforms were closer together. Subgenus Hermione in turn arose in the southwestern mediterranean and north west Africa. However, these are reconstructions, the Amaryllidaceae lacking a fossil record.|$|E
5|$|On the <b>Iberian</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> apothecaries' weights in the 19th {{century were}} {{relatively}} uniform, with 24grains per scruple (576grains per ounce), the standard in Romance countries. The weight of an apothecaries' pound was 345.1g in Spain and 344.2g in Portugal. As in Italy, {{some of the}} additional subdivisions of the Roman system, such as the obolo, were still in use there. It was standard to use the marco, defined as 8ounces, instead of the pound.|$|E
