5|$|Cubs start {{following}} their mothers at six weeks. The mother frequently shifts the cubs to new locations. A study of play behaviour of cheetah cubs showed that cubs tend to play after nursing or {{while they are}} on the move with their mothers. Play involves plenty of agility; attacks are seldom lethal. Playing cubs stay near their mothers. The study further revealed that while the cubs showed improvement in catching each other as they grew up, the ability to crouch and hide did not develop remarkably. Thus, it was suggested that play helps develop only certain aspects of predator defence. Weaning occurs at three to six months of age. The mother brings kills to her cubs; the cubs might purr as the mother licks them clean after the meal. Cubs as young as six months try to capture small prey like hares and juvenile gazelles. However, they may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> as long as 15 months of age to make a successful kill on their own.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 5 is {{the first}} game in the Resident Evil series {{designed}} for two-player cooperative gameplay. The first player controls Redfield, {{a former member of}} the fictional Special Tactics and Rescue Service (STARS) and current member of the BSAA, and a second player can control Alomar, who is introduced in this game. If a person plays alone, Alomar is controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). When the game has been completed once, there is an option to make Alomar the primary character. Two-player mode is available online or split-screen with a second player using the same console. A second player joining a split-screen game in progress will make the game reload the last checkpoint (the point at which the game was last saved); the second player joining an online game will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the first player reaches the next checkpoint, or restarts the previous one, to play. In split-screen mode, one player's viewpoint is presented in the top half of the screen, and the other in the bottom half, but each viewpoint is presented in widescreen format, rather than using the full width of the screen, resulting in unused space to the left and right of the two windows. If one player has critical health, only their partner can resuscitate them, and they will die if their partner cannot reach them. At certain points, players are deliberately separated. Players can trade items during gameplay, although weapons cannot be traded with online players. The game's story-line is linear, and interaction with other characters is mostly limited to cut-scenes.|$|E

25|$|The lone {{bright spot}} {{during this period}} was the Spurs being awarded the top pick in the 1987 NBA draft through NBA Draft Lottery. The Spurs used this {{selection}} on United States Naval Academy standout David Robinson. Although drafted in 1987, the Spurs would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the 1989–90 season to see Robinson actually play, due to a two-year commitment he had to serve with the United States Navy.|$|E

The 1965 season started with eight wins but only two wins from the next 10 games saw {{the end of the}} era.

25|$|Ostorius {{initiated}} further Romanisation {{during his}} command in the safer southern lands, founding Britain's first colony of military veterans at Camulodunum (modern Colchester) in 49 and probably establishing a municipium at Verulamium (St Albans). His tactical skill {{rather than his}} political acumen was his strength however. He had received a difficult brief as the Claudian lowlands were economically unspectacular and Britain's mineral wealth lay in the barbarian lands instead. Capture of these would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> later years.|$|E
25|$|The {{highlights}} for {{the week}} {{were not on the}} water, but rather off it. The Measurement Committee released the final rule interpretations.

Every cup team and all the media was trying {{to find out more about}} two of the final interpretations.

25|$|As {{the segment}} {{came to a}} close, the {{attention}} focused on Graham Rahal, Josef Newgarden and Simona de Silvestro. All three were among the drivers attempting to make the top 24 for the day. Rahal was too slow to make the field, while de Silvestro managed to bump her way in. In the last 30 minutes, Townsend Bell made two attempts, the second of which bumped his way in. With time running out, Newgarden was bumped out by James Jakes. Newgarden ran out {{of time to get}} back in line to make an attempt, and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> Sunday to qualify.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, {{the most}} {{complete}} compilation {{of the history of}} Mon kingdoms would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> 1910 and 1912 when Pak Lat Chronicles was published in a two-volume set. It was reportedly based on the stash of manuscripts found at Pak Lat, then an ethnic Mon enclave east of Bangkok. (The provenance and chronology of the manuscripts used in the publications are uncertain, and had not yet been studied by a Burma Mon scholar as of 2005.) Pak Lat weaves together all existing Mon narratives, including the history of Thaton Kingdom, Gavampati's linkage with the Buddha, the Hanthawaddy Chronicle from monarchs Wareru to Shin Sawbu (1287–1472), and Nidana's genealogy of kings.|$|E
25|$|Labre had an uncle, {{a parish}} priest, living some {{distance}} from his family home; this uncle gladly received him, and undertook his early education for the priesthood. At the age of sixteen, he approached his uncle about becoming a Trappist monk, but his parents {{told him he would}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> he grew older. When Benedict was about eighteen, an epidemic fell upon the city, and uncle and nephew busied themselves {{in the service of the}} sick. While the uncle took care of the souls and bodies of the people, Benedict went to and fro caring for the cattle. He cleaned their stalls and fed them; exchanging the life of a farm laborer for that of a student under his uncle's roof. Among the last victims of the epidemic was the uncle himself.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} {{season he}} became more of a feature in the Hampshire side in the County Championship, but would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> 2006 to make his List A debut for the county, which eventually came against Kent in the 2006 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. Known as an aggressive middle-order batsman, {{it was in the}} 2006 Pro40 that he recorded his maiden century and highest score in all formats during his time at Hampshire. He scored an unbeaten 158 in the Promotion/Relegation match against Glamorgan, helping Hampshire to a 151 run win and promotion to Division One. His performance won him praise from then Hampshire captain Shane Warne, with Warne tipping him as a possible future Hampshire captain. Benham did captain Hampshire, once in a first-class match in 2006 against Loughborough UCCE. At the end of the 2006 season, Benham was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award.|$|E
25|$|McLane {{moved to}} the U.S. Senate and served there from March 4, 1827 until April 29, 1829, when he resigned. Leading up to the presidential {{election}} of 1828, he worked very hard in a losing effort to win Delaware for Andrew Jackson. In doing so he completely cut his ties to the Claytons and the dominant political faction in the state. Clearly he would have little hope of reelection to the U.S. Senate or any future in Delaware politics. All his considerable hopes for a prestigious position rested with an appointment from the new president. But a former Federalist from an inconsequential opposition state would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> Jackson met other obligations. Having failed {{to become a part}} of the initial cabinet, as he had hoped, McLane reluctantly accepted appointment as Minister to England, arranged by his friend Martin Van Buren, now U.S. Secretary of State.|$|E
25|$|Speed {{remained}} with Moore for the 1994 season starting off with finishes of sixth at Atlanta, fifth at Darlington and third at Bristol, {{moving up to}} fifth place in the points. Two races later, Speed finished seventh at Talladega. It was during this time that Speed {{was inducted into the}} karting hall of fame. Speed would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the July Daytona race to get another top ten finish, a tenth. Speed and the team ran good through the summer stretch, often starting near the rear of the field but moving to the front. Unfortunately, Speed did not manage a top ten finish until Dover where he finished ninth. In the final four races, Speed had three great runs. A fifth at Charlotte, a tenth at Rockingham and a fourth at Atlanta where he led twenty laps. It wasn't enough for Speed to finish in the top ten in points. He finished eleventh behind Bill Elliott.|$|E
