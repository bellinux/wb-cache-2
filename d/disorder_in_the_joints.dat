40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is an immune-mediated {{disease of}} the joints that is characterized by chronic inflammation and synovial hyperplasia that eventually lead to cartilage and bone destruction. Synovial fibroblasts are mesenchymal cells recognized as a key cell population in RA due to their hyperproliferative and hypersensitive properties in the inflammatory milieu and hyperproduction of both inflammatory cytokines and matrix-degrading enzymes. On the immune cell side, a wealth of evidence has shown that CD 4 +T-cells, especially IL- 17 producing helper T (Th 17) cells, play a prominent role, particularly in the initiation of systemic immune response in RA. However, it is still unclear how the local chronic inflammation in the joint is elicited by a systemic immune response. Recent studies have {{shed light on the}} importance of the interaction between immune and mesenchymal cells in joints including synovial fibroblasts. In particular, mesenchymal cells contribute to the Th 17 -mediated chronic inflammation in RA by promoting the migration of Th 17 cells to the inflamed site and then the homeostatic proliferation and concomitant increase in IL- 17 production. In addition, recent progress in osteoimmunology has provided new insight into the pathogenesis of the bone destruction which takes place in RA. Th 17 -related cytokines have been shown to enhance osteoclastogenesis, mainly via synovial fibroblasts. Thus, mesenchymal cells are a determinant of the development of RA that links the systemic immune response and the local <b>disorder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> In addition, the interaction of immune and mesenchymal cells {{plays a key role in}} both the chronic inflammation and bone destruction seen in RA. Elucidation of the precise events involved in this interaction will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which chronic inflammation and bone destruction in joint results from a systemic immune response, and also will help provide a molecular basis for novel therapeutic strategies to treat RA...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Two {{cases of}} {{synovial}} chondromatosis of <b>the</b> temporomandibular <b>joint</b> (TMJ) are presented, including correlation of CT and MR imaging characteristics with surgical and pathologic findings. The usefulness of CT and MR imaging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> diagnosis of TMJ disorders is discussed. Synovial chondromatosis is a benign tumorlike disorder of <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> characterized by chondrome-taplasia of <b>the</b> synovial membrane, <b>in</b> which carti-laginous nodules form and may become peduncu-lated and/or detach from the synovial membrane, becoming loose bodies within <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> space. These may also calcify. The chief clinical {{features of this}} <b>disorder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> temporomandibular <b>joint</b> (TMJ) are preauricular swelling and pain, and re-stricted movement. Synovial chondromatosis of the TMJ, first described by Auhausen in 1933, is rare, with only about 40 cases reported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature. We present two cases of this disorder with corre-lation of the imaging and pathologic findings...|$|R
40|$|ONE of {{the most}} common {{developmental}} <b>disorders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elbow <b>joints</b> of dogs is a fragmented medial coronoid process (FCP) of the ulna (Wind and Packard 1986, Boulay 1998, LaFond and others 2002, Meyer-Lindenberg and others 2002); it was recognised for <b>the</b> first time <b>in</b> 1974 (Olsson 1974, Tirgari 1974). The pathogenesis of the lesion is still largely unknown (Guthrie and others 1992), because it has been examined only in its clinical stages. Dogs may become lame as early as three months of age (Denny and Gibbs 1980). The characteristic radiographic changes, which are all sec-ondary to the disease, appear later. The fragment removed at surgery does not reveal clues to its pathogenesis, because ossi-fication continues after the fracture by virtue of the vascular supply via its ligamentous attachment (Fox and others 1983, Olsson 1993) ...|$|R
40|$|Objective Increased {{friction}} due to impaired lubrication <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jaw <b>joint</b> {{has been}} considered {{as one of the}} possible causes for internal joint disorders. A very common internal <b>disorder</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jaw <b>joint</b> is an anteriorly dislocated articular disc. This is generally considered to contribute to the onset of arthritic injuries. Increase of friction as caused by impairment of lubrication is suspected to be a possible cause for such a disorder. Method The influence of friction was addressed by analysis of its effects on tensions and deformations of <b>the</b> cartilaginous structures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jaw <b>joint</b> using computational biomechanical analysis. Jaw open-close movements were simulated while in one or two compartments of <b>the</b> right <b>joint</b> friction was applied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> articular contact. <b>The</b> left <b>joint</b> was treated as the healthy control. Results The simulations predicted that friction primarily causes increased shear stress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> articular cartilage layers, but hardly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> articular disc. Conclusions This suggests that impaired lubrication may facilitate deterioration of the cartilage-subchondral bone unit of the articular surfaces. The results further suggest that increased friction is not a plausible cause for turning a normally functioning articular disc into an anteriorly dislocated one...|$|R
40|$|When the four-week-old woody stem of Prunus jamasakura {{was grown}} under {{simulated}} microgravity condition on a three-dimensional clinostat, it bent at growth, and width of its secondary xylem decreased {{due to the}} reduction of fiber cell numbers and a smaller microfibril angle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> secondary cell wall, as reported in our previous paper. Gravity induces {{the development of the}} secondary xylem that supports the stem upward against the action of gravity. In this study, morphological changes of the tissues and cells were microscopically observed. <b>Disorder</b> was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> concentric structure of tissues that organize the stem. The radial arrangement of the cells was also disturbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> secondary xylem, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> secondary phloem secondary cell walls of the bast fiber cells were undeveloped. These findings suggest that differentiation and development of the secondary xylem and the bast fiber cells are strongly controlled by terrestrial gravity.

40|$|Bruxism is {{a health}} problem {{consisting}} in grinding or tightly clenching {{the upper and}} lower teeth. Both the grinding and sliding lead to wear of the teeth and produce a noise during the night that is sufficiently loud to disturb the sleep of anyone sharing the bedroom. The tension produced causes problems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> muscles, tissues and other structures surrounding the jaw, ear pain, headaches, lesions to <b>the</b> teeth and <b>disorders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jaw <b>joints.</b> For an early, rapid, effective and economical diagnosis of bruxism, we propose the use of instrumented splints to detect and record the intensity and duration of inter dental pressure episodes. This paper sets out the design, manufacture and testing of an instrumented splint for diagnosing the signs of bruxism. The system stands out for its use of piezoelectric polymeric sensors which, because of their reduced thickness, do not cause any alteration to the patient’s bite. It lets a quantitative assessment of intraoral pressure be made and bruxism behavior be diagnosed at an early stage, so as to being able to programme corrective actions before irreversible dental wear appears.

These materials {{can be used to}} design and develop sensors, actuators and multifunctional systems with a large number of applications for developing medical devices (for both surgery and implants). On the other hand, Bruxism is a health problem consisting on grinding or tightly clenching the upper and lower teeth, and both phenomena lead to wear of the teeth and produce a noise during the night that is sufficiently loud to disturb the sleep of anyone sharing the bedroom. The tension produced also causes problems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> muscles, tissues and other structures surrounding the jaw, ear pain, headaches, lesions to <b>the</b> teeth and <b>disorders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jaw <b>joints.</b> For an early, rapid, effective and economical diagnosis of bruxism, we propose the use of instrumented splints based on the use of active materials, in order to detect and record the intensity and duration of interdentally pressure episodes.

40|$|Engineered {{cementitious}} composites (ECC) are {{a class of}} high-performance fiber reinforced cementitious composite with strain hardening and multiple cracking properties. For a reinforced concrete member, substitution of conventional concrete with ECC can significantly improve <b>the</b> deformation characteristics <b>in</b> terms of reinforced composite tensile or shear strength and energy dissipation ability. In this paper, a number of RC/ECC composite beam-column joints have been tested under reversed cyclic loading to study the effect of substitution of concrete with ECC <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> zone on <b>the</b> seismic behaviors of composite members. The experimental parameters include shear reinforcement ratio <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> zone, axial load level on the column and substitution of concrete with ECC or not. According to the test results, for the specimens without shear reinforcement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> zone, substitution of concrete with ECC <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> zone cannot change the brittle shear failure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> zone, but can significantly increase the load capacity and ductility of <b>the</b> beam-column <b>joint</b> specimens, {{as well as the}} energy dissipation ability due to high ductility and shear strength of ECC material. For the specimens with insufficient or proper shear reinforcement ratio, substitution of concrete with ECC <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> zone can lead to failure mode change from brittle shear failure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> zone to a more ductile failure mode, i. e. flexural failure {{at the base of the}} beam, with increased load capacity, ductility and energy dissipation ability. Increase of axial load on column and shear reinforcement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> zone have little effect on seismic behaviors of the members when they failed by flexural failure at the base of beam. <b>In</b> a word, <b>the</b> substitution of concrete with ECC <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joint</b> zone was experimentally proved to be an effective method to increase the seismic resistance of beam-column joint specimens...|$|R

40|$|Collagen-induced {{arthritis}} was {{evoked by}} an injection of lipopolysaccharide and anti-type II collagen antibody in mice. <b>In</b> parallel with <b>the</b> onset of arthritis, granulocytes with large light scatter and a Mac- 1 + Gr- 1 + phenotype expanded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> of these mice. Lymphocytes with a CD 3 − B 220 + phenotype (i. e. B 220 + B cells) were the major population among lymphocyte subsets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> irrespective of disease. To determine {{the origin of}} these leucocyte populations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> and other organs, parabiotic experiments using CBF 1 Ly 5. 1 and CBF 1 Ly 5. 2 mice were conducted in mice with and without collagen-induced arthritis.

40|$|Bacterial {{arthritis}} is {{a rapidly}} progressive and highly destructive joint disease in humans, with Staphylococcus aureus and Neisseria gonorrhoeae the major causative agents, although beta-hemolytic streptococci as well often induce the disease. We demonstrate here that intravenous inoculation of CD- 1 mice {{with the group}} A streptococcus (GAS) species Streptococcus pyogenes resulted in {{a high incidence of}} septic arthritis. Signs of arthritis emerged within the first few days after injection, and bacterial examinations revealed that colonization of <b>the</b> inoculated GAS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arthritic <b>joints</b> persisted for 21 days. Induction of persistent septic arthritis was dependent on the number of microorganisms inoculated. Immunohistochemical staining of GAS with anti-GAS antibodies revealed colonization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> of infected mice. Cytokine levels were quantified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> and sera of infected mice by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. High levels of interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and IL- 6 were detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> from 3 to 20 days after infection. We noted that an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amount of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), which is a key cytokine in osteoclastogenesis, was also evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> of <b>the</b> infected mice.
