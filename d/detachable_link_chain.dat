The results show that the largest stress value is appeared on the contacting curved arm of driven round <b>link</b> <b>chain,</b> the second stress value is connecting round <b>link</b> <b>chain,</b> the least stress value is driving round link chain; it is circular shape of the contact area of round <b>link</b> <b>chains</b> and it is the main reasons of damage that the largest stress and deformation values of impact is caused by instant changing loading when time lasts 0. 05 s, and the series gradually fluctuation of strength is led to fatigue through finite element analysis software.

In this article, we study the <b>link</b> <b>chain</b> extraction problem that is critical to the extraction of Web pages that are related. A <b>link</b> <b>chain</b> is an ordered list of anchor elements linking two Web pages related by some semantic relationship.

40|$|<b>Link</b> <b>chains</b> {{are widely}} used in many {{different}} sectors of industry, for example in hoist applications, marine applications, manure chains in agricultural applications, snow chains for cars or even as a bicycle lock. A more specific application is the tickler <b>chain,</b> where the <b>link</b> <b>chain</b> is used to drag over the seabed {{in order to increase}} the catch rate. In this case the <b>link</b> <b>chain</b> is subjected to extreme abrasive wear due to the sand and seawater environment. Fracture of these chains causes serious economical damage due to downtime and especially production loss. The main objective of this research is to quantify the most important wear mechanisms that act on a <b>link</b> <b>chain,</b> and with that knowledge to try to design and build a reliable test rig that simulates abrasive wear of tickler chains. With these simulation results the chain parameters, such as geometry and material, can be improved in order to decrease the wear rate...|$|R

40|$|International audienceProtein {{ubiquitylation}} {{is essential}} for many events linked to intracellular protein trafficking. Despite {{the significance of this}} process, the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of ubiquitylation remain largely unknown. Plasma membrane transporters are subjected to tightly regulated endocytosis, and ubiquitylation is a key signal at several stages of the endocytic pathway. The yeast monocarboxylate transporter Jen 1 displays glucose-regulated endocytosis. We show here that Casein Kinase 1 -dependent phosphorylation, and HECT-ubiquitin ligase Rsp 5 -dependent ubiquitylation are required for Jen 1 endocytosis. Ubiquitylation and endocytosis of Jen 1 are induced within minutes in response to glucose addition. Jen 1 is modified at the cell surface by oligo-ubiquitylation with ubiquitin-K 63 <b>linked</b> <b>chain(s),</b> and Jen 1 -Lys 338 is one of the target residues. Ubiquitin-K 63 <b>linked</b> <b>chain(s)</b> are also required directly or indirectly to sort Jen 1 into multivesicular bodies (MVBs).
