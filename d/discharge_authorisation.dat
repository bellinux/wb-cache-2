40|$|The {{results of}} the 1978 {{environmental}} survey program at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission Research Establishment (AAECRE) are presented. They show that the amounts of radioisotopes of AAECRE origin found in samples of environmental materials {{were not significantly different}} from the very small amounts found in previous years. The possible annual radiation dose to the hypothetical 'most highly exposed' member of the public, as calculated from the results, is less than one ten-thousandth of that considered acceptable by the NSW Health Commission and the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. Appendices show that the performances in respect to the State-approved <b>discharge</b> <b>authorisations</b> for liquid and gaseous effluents were very satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of environmental and}} effluent monitoring conducted {{in the vicinity of}} the Lucas Heights Research Laboratories (LHRL) during 1994. All low level liquid and gaseous effluent discharges complied with existing <b>discharge</b> <b>authorisations</b> and relevant environmental regulations. Potential effective doses to the general public from controlled airborne discharges during this period were estimated to be less than 0. 015 mSv/year for receptor locations on the 1. 6 km buffer zone boundary around HIFAR. This value represents 1. 5 % of the 1 mSv/ year dose limit for long term exposure that is recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council and 5 % of the site dose constraint of 0. 3 mSv/year adopted by ANSTO...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of environmental and}} effluent monitoring conducted in 1999 at the two sites {{owned and operated by}} ANSTO at the Lucas Heights Science and Technology Centre (LHSTC) and the National Medical Cyclotron (NMC). All low-level liquid and gaseous effluent discharges complied with existing <b>discharge</b> <b>authorisations</b> and relevant environmental regulations. Potential effective doses to the general public from LHSTC controlled airborne discharges were estimated for 1999 using the PC-Cream atmospheric dispersion and dosimetry code. The potential effective doses to the public in 1999 were estimated to be less than 0. 010 mSv/year for all receptor locations on the LHSTC 1. 6 km buffer zone boundary or beyond. This value represents 1 % of the I milli sievert (mSv) per year dose limit for long term exposure that is recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council and 3. 3 % of the LHSTC site dose constraint of 0. 3 mSv/year. It is concluded that there is no impact on the health of the community staff or the environment as a consequence of operations at the Lucas Heights Science and Technology Centre or the National Medical Cyclotron...|$|R
