50|$|Mixing <b>ground</b> <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> {{with water}} causes a {{chemical}} reaction between two compounds in the seed: the enzyme myrosinase and various glucosinolates such as sinigrin, myrosin, and sinalbin. The myrosinase enzyme turns the glucosinolates into various isothiocyanate compounds known generally as mustard oil. The concentrations of different glucosinolates in mustard plant varieties, {{and the different}} isothiocyanates that are produced, make different flavors and intensities.|$|E
40|$|Ten cultivars {{of three}} Brassica species were {{compared}} for volatile compounds in hydrated ground seeds that were fungicidal to Rhizoctollia solani AG- 4. Among the samples tested, the volatile substances in the <b>ground</b> <b>seed</b> of <b>mustard</b> (Brassica juncea cv. Ban Sin) showed the strongest fungicidal effect. Allyl isothiocyanate {{was one of}} the predominant fungicidal compounds detected in the ground seed of all Brassica species tested, and the amount was the highest in <b>ground</b> <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> meals. Among the nine carriers tested for <b>seed</b> coating with <b>ground</b> <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> meal, Biolan peat 133 was the most effective for the seed treatment. Cabbage seeds treated with a mixture of <b>ground</b> <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> meal and Biolan peat 133 (MBF mixture) at 2 : 3 ratio (w/w) resulted in a significant reduction in incidence of Rhizoctonia damping-off with no harmful effects to the germination of treated seeds. Effective control of Rhizoctollia damping-off of cabbage by the seed treatment with the MBF mixture was also obtained in a large-scale experiment conducted in a commercial automated environment-control led greenhouse.

It is usually prepared immediately before a meal; mustard prepared with water, in particular, is more pungent but deteriorates rapidly.|$|R
50|$|The pungency of the {{condiment}} mustard {{results when}} <b>ground</b> <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds</b> {{are mixed with}} water, vinegar, or other liquid (or even when chewed). Under these conditions, a chemical reaction between the enzyme myrosinase and a glucosinolate known as sinigrin from the seeds of black mustard (Brassica nigra) or brown Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) produces allyl isothiocyanate. By distillation one can produce a very sharp-tasting essential oil, sometimes called volatile oil of mustard, containing more than 92% allyl isothiocyanate. The pungency of allyl isothiocyanate {{is due to the}} activation of the TRPA1 ion channel in sensory neurons. White mustard (Brassica hirta) does not yield allyl isothiocyanate, but a different and milder isothiocyanate.|$|E

A recipe for mustard appears in De re coquinaria, the anonymously compiled Roman cookbook from the late 4th or early 5th century; the recipe calls for a mixture of ground mustard, pepper, caraway, lovage, grilled coriander seeds, dill, celery, thyme, oregano, onion, honey, vinegar, fish sauce, and oil, and {{was intended as a}} glaze for spit-roasted boar.

The mustard husks may be ground with the seeds, or winnowed away after the initial crushing; [...] "whole-grain mustard" [...] retains some unground or partially <b>ground</b> <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds.</b> Bavarian sweet mustard contains very little acid, substituting copious amounts of sugar for preservation. The Tecuci mustard from Romania is a sweet variety very popular in Eastern Europe and is suitable for barbecued meats such as mititei.

40|$|Mustard (Brassica spp.), {{a native}} to {{temperate}} regions of Europe, {{was one of}} the first domesticated crops. This crop's economic value resulted in its wide dispersal and it has been grown as a herb in Asia, North Africa, and Europe for thousands of years. Ancient Greeks and Romans enjoyed mustard (sinapis) seed as a paste and powder. In about 1300, the name "mustard " was given to the condiment made by mixing mustum, which is the Latin word for unfermented grape juice, with <b>ground</b> <b>mustard</b> <b>seeds.</b> Mustard has been a major specialty crop in North America since supplies from western Europe were interrupted by World War II. California and Montana were the major production areas until the early 1950 s. Production of mustard in the Upper Midwest began in the early 1960 s. Mustard is currently grown on approximately 250, 000 acres annually in the United States. North Dakota has the largest share of domestic production. Canadian mustard production increased for twenty years until it peaked in the mid- 1980 s. Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan currently grow a large share of the world's mustard crop. The French people are the largest consumers of mustard (1. 5 lbs/person/year), and buy approximately 70 % of the annual Canadian production. Three types of mustard, yellow, brown, and oriental, are grown in North America. Yellow mustard (Brassica hirta) comprises about 90 % of the crop in Montana. In Europe, yellow mustard is also known as white mustard (Sinapis alba- an older botanical name). The Crop Profile/PMSP database, including this document, is supported by USDA NIFA. Brown and oriental mustards (Brassica juncea) are grown on limited acres. This crop is commonly produced in a rotation with small grains...|$|E

40|$|Background: Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) from mustard is cytotoxic; {{however the}} {{mechanism}} of its toxicity is unknown. We {{examined the effects of}} AITC on heat shock protein (HSP) 70 expression in Caenorhabditis elegans. We also examined factors affecting the production of AITC from its precursor, sinigrin, a glucosinolate, in ground Brassica juncea cv. Vulcan <b>seed</b> as <b>mustard</b> has some potential as a biopesticide. Findings: An assay to determine the concentration of AITC in <b>ground</b> <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> was improved to allow the measurement of AITC release in the first minutes after exposure of <b>ground</b> <b>mustard</b> <b>seed</b> to water. Using this assay, we determined that temperatures above 67 °C decreased sinigrin conversion to AITC in hydrated ground B. juncea seed. A pH near 6. 0 was found to be necessary for AITC release. RT-qPCR revealed no significant change in HSP 70 A mRNA expression at low concentrations of AITC ( 1. 0 μM) resulted in a four- to five-fold increase in expression. A HSP 70 ELISA showed that AITC toxicity in C. elegans was ameliorated by the presence of ground seed from low sinigrin B. juncea cv. Arrid. Conclusions: • AITC induced toxicity in C. elegans, as measured by HSP 70 expression. • Conditions required for the conversion of sinigrin to AITC in ground B. juncea seed were determined. • The use of C. elegans as a bioassay to test AITC or mustard biopesticide efficacy is discussed...|$|R

Since the millers often backed the water up too high, there were time and again floods. In particular, the Nassmühle (literally, “Wet Mill”) came to grief one day in the late 16th century when local farmers, angered at having their harvest wiped out by flooding, stormed the mill on 2 June 1573 and destroyed it.
