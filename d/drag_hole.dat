40|$|Main {{objective}} of horizontal driling {{is to place}} a drain-hole for a long distance within the pay zone to enhance productivity or injectivity. In drilling horizontal wells, more serious problems appear than in drilling vertical wells. These problems are: poor hole cleaning, excessive torque and <b>drag,</b> <b>hole</b> filling, pipe stucking, wellbore instability, loss of circulation, formation damage, poor cement job, and difficulties at logging jobs. From that reason, successful drilling and production of horizontal well depends largely on the fluid used during drilling and completion phases. Several new fluids, that fulfill {{some or all of}} required properties (hole cleaning, cutting suspension, good lubrication, and relative low formation damage), are presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|The {{transformation}} of kinetically unstable plasma eigenmodes into hole-clump pairs with temporally evolving carrier frequencies was recently {{attributed to the}} emergence of an intermediate stage in the mode evolution cycle, that of an unmodulated plateau in the phase space distribution of fast particles. The role of the plateau as the hole-clump breeding ground is further substantiated in this article via consideration of its linear and nonlinear stability in the presence of fast particle collisions and sources, which are known to affect the production rates and subsequent frequency sweeping of holes and clumps. In particular, collisional relaxation, as mediated by e. g. velocity space diffusion or even simple Krook-type collisions, is found to inhibit hole-clump generation and detachment from the plateau, as it should. On the other hand, slowing down of the fast particles turns out to have an asymmetrically destabilizing/stabilizing effect, which explains the well-known result that collisional <b>drag</b> enhances <b>holes</b> and their sweeping rates but suppresses clumps. It is further demonstrated that relaxation of the plateau edge gradients has only a minor quantitative effect and does not change the plateau stability qualitatively, unless the edge region extends far into the plateau shelf and the corresponding Landau pole needs to be taken into account...|$|R

The ultra-deep sour gas reservoir in the Yuanba Gasfield is characterized by complicated geologic structure, deep reservoirs and complex drilled formation, especially in the continental deep strata which are highly abrasive with low ROP (rate of penetration) and long drilling period. After many years of drilling practice and technical research, the following six key drilling and completion technologies for this type reservoir are established by introducing new tools and technologies, developing specialized drill bits and optimizing drilling design. They are: casing program optimization technology for ROP increasing and safe well completion; gas drilling technology for shallow continental strata and high-efficiency drilling technology for deep high-abrasion continental strata; drilling fluid support technologies of gas–liquid conversion, ultra-deep highly-deviated wells and horizontal-well lubrication and <b>drag</b> reduction, <b>hole</b> stability control and sour gas contamination prevention; well cementing technologies for gas medium, deep-well long cementing intervals and ultra-high pressure small space; horizontal-well trajectory control technologies for measuring instrument, downhole motor optimization and bottom hole assembly design; and liner completion modes and completion string optimization technologies suitable for this gas reservoir.

The effects of several viscosifiers such as xanthan gum, PAC-R, polyplus-dry and hydroxyl ethyl cellulose (HEC) on shale hydration were studied using hot-rolling dispersion test. The results showed that viscosifiers can be used to prevent shale hydration. Besides, an increase of viscosifiers concentration can reduce shale hydration and dispersion.

The study also revealed that xanthan gum gives an optimum rheological properties of KCl-polymer system. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{our program}} of {{studying}} numerically the so-called Bondi-Hoyle accretion in the fully relativistic regime, we present here first results concerning {{the evolution of}} matter accreting supersonically onto a rotating (Kerr) black hole. These computations generalize previous results where the non-rotating (Schwarzschild) case was extensively considered. We parametrize our initial data by the asymptotic conditions for the fluid and explore the dependence of the solution on the angular momentum of the black hole. Towards quantifying the robustness of our numerical results, we use two different geometrical foliations of the black hole spacetime, the standard form of the Kerr metric in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates {{as well as its}} Kerr-Schild form, which is free of coordinate singularities at the black hole horizon. We demonstrate some important advantages of using such horizon adapted coordinate systems. Our numerical study indicates that regardless {{of the value of the}} black hole spin the final accretion pattern is always stable, leading to constant accretion rates of mass and momentum. The flow is characterized by a strong tail shock, which, unlike the Schwarzschild case, is increasingly wrapped around the central black hole as the hole angular momentum increases.

40|$|Astrophysical {{black holes}} are the {{simplest}} possible objects. They are completely described by only two parameters in general relativity, their mass {{and the specific}} angular momentum, spin. The spin is a fundamental characteristic of a black hole, but unlike mass it leaves a mark on space-time only {{very close to the}} event horizon, and is therefore more difficult to measure. The observational relevance of the spin {{comes from the fact that}} it sets the size scale of the last stable orbit around the accreting black <b>hole,</b> <b>dragging</b> the accretion disc farther in the faster it spins. Black hole spin is a very controversial topic in both stellar and supermassive black holes. There are two methods to determine spin in binary systems, using either the direct disc continuum or the reflected emission. These can give significantly different values, and understanding the source of this discrepancy is important especially for interpreting AGN spin, where only the reflection method can be used. We have strived to understand and carefully model the time-averaged energy spectra from several Galactic black hole binaries, in order to ultimately measure the black hole spin. Achieving this has required in-depth understanding of the instruments as well as the data analysis methods. The spin leaves only minor traces in the data, and these can be affected by calibration uncertainties, uncertainties in the models and systematic uncertainties. This knowledge is absolutely essential for a detailed analysis of all relativistically smeared atomic features seen in the time-averaged energy spectra of compact objects. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} an {{analysis}} of an extended reach drilling (ERD) well planned to be drilled from Varg A to the Rev East reservoir in the North Sea. It is a continuation on the torque and drag (T&D) analysis “Torque and Drag Analysis for Extended Reach Well 15 / 12 -A- 11 A” written by the same author. Proper T&D analysis is determining for good ERD drilling practices. The T&D analysis is showing that torque values in the 8 ½” section are substantially high and that buckling of the drillstring is {{likely to occur in}} that same section. However, ERD challenges are numerous and not only limited to T&D. To create a more realistic picture of the well it is essential to perform a hydraulics analysis including other elements such as hole cleaning, equivalent circulating density (ECD) management, the running and cementing of casing and standpipe pressures. They are all key issues that must be planned for and evaluated in order for the well to be a success. The software WELLPLAN has been utilized to do a proper hydraulics analysis of 15 / 12 -A- 11 A. The report is set out to present this complex well analysis as simply and structured as possible. 15 / 12 -A- 11 A is an 8000 m, almost horizontal well which means higher torque, more <b>drag,</b> more complex <b>hole</b> cleaning, higher surface pressure and higher ECD fluctuations. One of the main purposes of this report is to identify what special operational demands are set to the rig drilling 15 / 12 -A- 11 A when looking at hydraulic and T&D requirements. By doing simulations in WELLPLAN the goal is to capture the best practices for complex ERD planning and drilling of 15 / 12 -A- 11 A. Drilling this well would require excellent engineering skills, alternative drilling strategies and significant planning to implement real optimization to the drilling performance. New achievements in ERD drilling are demonstrating {{that it is possible to}} exceed the current ERD experience with existing technology. Relevant technology for 15 / 12 -A- 11 A is being evaluated in this report. After the T&D study in “Torque and Drag Analysis for Extended Reach Well 15 / 12 -A- 11 A”, high torque in the last 8 ½” section was considered the major operational challenge. However, after performing a hydraulics analysis of 15 / 12 -A- 11 A it is found to be more than one major challenge for drilling this complex ERD well. Several different well scenarios have been modeled with focus on standpipe pressures, ECD and flowrates for efficient hole cleaning. The major risks with respect to hydraulics found for 15 / 12 -A- 11 A are high ECD fluctuations in the reservoir section, exceeding standpipe pressure and challenging hole cleaning due to thehigh well inclination and a small annular flow area. The well was initially planned with only two hole sections, the 12 ¼” and 8 ½” section. However, due to the low reservoir pressure at Rev and the high ECD in the 8 ½” section,another hole section has been suggested added to the existing well profile. This is in order to reduce the high ECD in the 6 ” reservoir section allowing for a lower drilling fluid weight, hence reducing the high over balance in the reservoir and minimizing the risk of fracturing the formation. An extended T&D analysis, together with procedures for running and cementing the casing and the two liners have been included in the final analysis of 15 / 12 -A- 11 A. </p...|$|R
