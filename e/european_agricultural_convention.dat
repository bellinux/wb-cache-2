50|$|This means {{because of}} the {{protectionist}} nature of the CAP, agricultural products from developing countries are rendered incompetitive in both Europe (an important export market for developing countries) and on their home markets (as <b>European</b> <b>agricultural</b> products are dumped on developing countries' markets with help from <b>European</b> <b>agricultural</b> subsidies).

40|$|Abstract This project {{addresses}} the <b>European</b> <b>agricultural</b> subsidies. The main focus is the paradoxality {{in the fact}} that the <b>European</b> <b>agricultural</b> subsidies is sustained despite the fact that it can be considered being economically unfavourable to the European Union and its residents. Furthermore, we have chosen to have our focus at how the discursive understanding of the <b>European</b> <b>agricultural</b> subsidies has developed since its establishment with the Treaty of Rome in 1957. To this end it is important to say that this project only concerns the treaties of Rome and Lisboa and not the treaties that were passed in the meantime. This is done by means of a discourse analysis on the basis of Ernesto Laclau’s and Chantal Mouffes’ Discourse Theory. The Discourse Theory has its theory of science in the post-structuralism, which also underlies the foundation of this project. Furthermore, it is examined how the discourses can be understood in connection with theories of trade and economic paradigms such as free trade, protectionism, mercantilism, and interdependence. To examine why the financial subsidies are sustained, though the discourse about this has changed, the theory of path dependence is used. This theory is mostly used to explain the paradox of this project: Why are the <b>European</b> <b>agricultural</b> subsidies sustained when it at the same time disturbs the competition in the agricultural market, despite a European wish for a free trade. Furthermore, a diachronic analysis strategy is used throughout the project, working through the time from 1957 until today, with focus on those events and treaties, which could be a reason for a discourse change. In the discourse analysis we will identify conceptions from Laclau and Mouffe’s Theory of Discourse through a deconstruction of the chosen empirical material. In addition to this deconstruction, we wish to identify the hegemonic struggles within the development of the discourse of the <b>European</b> <b>agricultural</b> subsidies. To this, we add a comparative analysis of respectively the Treaties of Rome and Lisbon. In light of this it will be identified, with support of the aforementioned theories of trade, which points of views in the given periods have influenced the discourse of the European Union and the thereby following institutionalization. We can conclude that because of the discursive development of the <b>European</b> <b>agricultural</b> subsidies it can be sustained, and this is mainly because of the comprehensive discursive changing from the Treaty of Rome to the Treaty of Lisbon. A radical changing of the policy will require a widespread dislocation of the existing discourse, because the procedure of decisions will be characterized with path dependence which has biased the discourse. The European Union is interested in keeping its own power of influence, i. e. that the Union wants to sustain the Common Agricultural Policy. As an institution, the European Union is categorized with a cooperation of an international character with different wishes to the <b>European</b> <b>agricultural</b> subsidies. Because of a historical justification the financial subsidies is maintained. This has - in the meantime - resulted in inadvertent consequences...|$|R
