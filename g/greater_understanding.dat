5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the only}} welding process was forge welding, which blacksmiths had used for millenia to join iron and steel by heating and hammering. Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first {{processes}} to develop late in the century, and electric resistance welding followed soon after. Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like SMAW, now {{one of the most popular}} welding methods, as well as semi-automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW, SAW, FCAW and ESW. Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding, electron beam welding, magnetic pulse welding (MPW), and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century. Today, the science continues to advance. Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings, and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain <b>greater</b> <b>understanding</b> of weld quality.|$|E
