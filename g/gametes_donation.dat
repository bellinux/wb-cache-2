Outcomes of such contact appear largely, but not universally, positive. This paper seeks {{to understand better}} the characteristics of associated support services. Information gathered using the authors' direct experiences and professional and personal networks {{in different parts of}} the world indicates the emergence of four main groupings: (i) publically funded services outside of treatment centers; (ii) services provided by fertility treatment or gamete bank services; (iii) services provided privately by independent psychosocial or legal practitioners; and (4) services organized by offspring and/or recipient parents. Key operational features examined were: (i) who can access such services and when; (ii) what professional standards and funding are in place to provide them; and (iii) how ‘matching’ and contact processes are managed. Differences appear influenced variously by the needs of those directly affected, local policies, national legislation and the interests of the fertility services which recruit gamete donors and/or deliver donor conception treatments. The paper is intended to inform fuller debate about how best to meet the needs of those seeking information and contact, the implications for the way that fertility treatment and <b>gametes</b> <b>donation</b> services are currently provided and future research needs...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Iran is {{the only}} Islamic country in the Middle East which {{undertakes}} <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> an assisted reproductive technology which has developed in the past 30 years. This study addresses the current situation and future potential of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> in Iran {{in the context of}} the various cultural, legal and religious dilemmas which accompany it. This project utilizes a mixed methods approach, including in-formal group discussion and participant observation. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with practitioners (N= 12) in three fertility centres as well as with the members of the Planning Committee of the Medical Ethics Centre of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) (N= 7). General information about the centres was also collected using a questionnaire (N= 3). The results of the study suggest that the practice of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> can result in bioethical issues in the legal, socio-cultural, political and religious contexts in Iran. The identity of a child resulting from <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> is an important legal issue that overrides other issues such as inheritance. In addition, <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> creates new categories of relatedness involving genetic and social factors that generate socio-cultural complexity and ambiguity. The socio-cultural context in Iran may create specific stigmas and social pressures for the child, donor and recipient. Other issues that might occur include the exploitation of the donor, harassment and blackmail of the recipient, commercialisation of the whole procedure, and incest. In addition, the varieties of fatwas that have been raised in relation to <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> generate an unclear and ambiguous religious situation for patients, donors and physicians. Moreover, the results show a gap between permitting <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> by fatwas and its practice. The lack of specific laws, guidelines, unique codes of practice, and health policies related to <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> not only causes problems related to the practice of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> but also has considerable socio-cultural repercussions in Iran. This thesis also considers how the medical ethics curriculum of Tehran University of Medical Sciences can be adapted and further developed to address the issues raised by the use of this new bio-technology in the Iranian context. Analysis of the current medical ethics curriculum at TUMS, demonstrates that it offers physicians an ethical framework and also provides training related to some of the bioethical issues which are involved in <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> practices, although <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> has not been specifically included in this curriculum. In the absence of this type of medical ethics curriculum, <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> practices continue to be considered in a haphazard and informal way during teaching rounds in the clinical years. ...|$|R

This paper focuses on the local moral worlds of infertile Muslims as they attempt to make, in the religiously correct fashion, Muslim babies at in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics in Egypt and Lebanon. As early as 1980, authoritative fatwas issued from Egypt’s famed Al-Azhar University suggested that IVF and similar technologies are permissible {{as long as they do}} not involve any form of third-party donation (of sperm, eggs, embryos, or uteruses). Since the late 1990 s, however, divergences in opinion over third-party <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> have occurred between Sunni and Shi’ite Muslims, with Iran’s leading ayatollah permitting <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> under certain conditions. This Iranian fatwa has had profound implications for the country of Lebanon, where a Shi’ite majority also seeks IVF services.

The present study was part of the Swedish study on <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> a prospective longitudinal cohort study including all fertility clinics performing <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> in Sweden. The sample comprised 164 oocyte donors, 89 sperm donors, 251 people treated with their own gametes (in vitro fertilisation (IVF)), 213 oocyte recipients and 487 sperm recipients. A study-specific questionnaire was used. Attitudes vary widely between couples using their own gametes for IVF and those receiving or donating oocyte or sperm. The groups differed in their responses to most questions. Oocyte and sperm donors were more likely to agree with the statements "The donor should be informed if the donation results in a child" and "Offspring should receive some information about the donor during mature adolescence" than recipients of donated gametes and couples treated with their own gametes. Donor recipients, IVF couples and donors expressed different attitudes towards openness and information when it came to <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> and those differences seemed to depend on their current reproductive situation.

40|$|Abstract Background This {{investigation}} describes {{features of}} patients undergoing {{in vitro fertilisation}} (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET) where both gametes were obtained from anonymous donors. Methods Gamete unsuitability or loss was confirmed in both members of seven otherwise healthy couples presenting for reproductive endocrinology consultation over a 12 -month interval in Ireland. IVF was undertaken with fresh oocytes provided by anonymous donors in Ukraine; frozen sperm (anonymous donor) was obtained from a licensed tissue establishment. For recipients, saline-enhanced sonography {{was used to assess}} intrauterine contour with endometrial preparation via transdermal estrogen. Results Among commissioning couples, mean&# 177;SD female and male age was 41. 9 &# 177; 3. 7 and 44. 6 &# 177; 3. 5 yrs, respectively. During this period, female age for non dual anonymous <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> IVF patients was 37. 9 &# 177; 3 yrs (p < 0. 001). Infertility duration was &# 8805; 3 yrs for couples enrolling in dual <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> and each had &# 8805; 2 prior failed fertility treatments using native oocytes. All seven recipient couples proceeded to embryo transfer, although one patient had two transfers. Clinical pregnancy was achieved for 5 / 7 (71. 4 %) patients. Non-transferred cryopreserved embryos were available for all seven couples. Conclusions Mean age of females undergoing dual anonymous donor <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> with IVF is significantly higher than the background IVF patient population. Even when neither partner is able to contribute any gametes for IVF, the clinical pregnancy rate per transfer can be satisfactory if both anonymous egg and sperm donation are used concurrently.

40|$|The task of legally characterising complex {{interpersonal}} relationships presents {{a challenge to}} lawyers, legislators and academics. In law, relationships between parties are commonly characterised in terms of competing sets of rights. The parties are characterised as adversaries, in conflict, and this conflict is resolved by balancing the competing rights of one against the other. Under this model, rights create metaphorical boundaries between autonomous liberal individuals. Relational theories of rights challenge the dominant liberal model {{of the individual and}} their legal relations by exchanging the metaphor of boundaries for a study of real relationships. In this way, rights function to facilitate and structure relationships between parties, rather than to keep parties separated. Under a relational model, the autonomy of each person can only be understood {{in the context of their}} relationships. The rights-holder can not be viewed in isolation. In this thesis, I consider the legal relationships between Australian parties to <b>gamete</b> <b>donation.</b> In particular, I argue that the relationships may have been well described by a liberal model of rights in the past, but that the liberal model is no longer adequate to characterise the developing {{interpersonal relationships}} between the parties. I demonstrate that relational theories of rights provide a sound theoretical basis for characterising the increasingly relational parties to <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> as they exist now and into the future. In addition to describing technological, social and legal developments in donor conception from the early 1900 ’s to the present day, I place these developments in the context of a broad social shift from liberal to a post-liberal society. In particular, this social shift is characterised by decreased separation between domains of public and private, and represents a deep psychological shift in our understanding of the individual as increasingly interpersonal and relational. In the context of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> in Australia, this shift is manifested in increasing exchange of information between parties over time. In particular, disclosure of information about donors to donor-conceived offspring has been a significant political and academic focus. My thesis first demonstrates a link between the broad post-liberal social shift and changing concept of the individual to the evolving relationships between parties to <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> and, second, advocates for the current trajectory of change towards increasingly relational parties to <b>gamete</b> <b>donation.</b> Thesis (Ph.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Two {{decades after}} the {{introduction}} of Swedish legislation that allows children born {{as a result of}} <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> access to identifying information about the donor, a nationwide multicentre study on the psychosocial consequences of this legislation for recipients and donors of gametes was initiated in 2005. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate recipient couples attitudes and behaviour regarding disclosure to offspring and others, attitudes towards genetic parenthood and perceptions of information regarding parenthood after donation. METHODS: The present study is part of the prospective longitudinal Swedish study on <b>gamete</b> <b>donation,</b> including all fertility clinics performing donation treatment in Sweden. A consecutive cohort of 152 heterosexual recipient couples of donated oocytes (72 % response) and 127 heterosexual recipient couples of donated sperm (81 % response) accepted participation in the study. In connection with the donation treatment, male and female participants individually completed two questionnaires with study-specific instruments concerning disclosure, genetic parenthood and informational aspects. RESULTS: About 90 % of participants (in couples receiving anonymous donated gametes) supported disclosure and openness to the offspring concerning his/her genetic origin. Only 6 % of all participants had not told other people about their donation treatment. Between 26 and 40 % of participants wanted additional information/support about parenthood following donation treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Two {{decades after the}} Swedish legislation of identifiable gamete donors, recipient couples of anonymously donated sperm and oocytes are relatively open about their treatment and support disclosure to offspring. Recipient couples may benefit from more information and support regarding parenthood after <b>gamete</b> <b>donation.</b> Further studies are required to follow-up on the future parents actual disclosure behaviour directed to offspring.

40|$|Today some {{infertile}} {{couples who}} want to have children have request for getting gametes which is a confidential process. According to law, no person must know the identity of the gamete providers (1). Confidentiality of information relating to <b>gamete</b> and embryo <b>donation</b> can cause serious ethical problems. In some countries, forming the Bank of gametes and embryos is intended as a way to prevent privacy problems. The confidentiality of the information may cause several ethical problems that its solution must be looked (2). Therefore we tried to find a new solution for the problem of embryo and gamete Bank which relies on Islamic rules. In this research, different kind of studies was considered such as relevant books, analytic and review articles applied in different congresses especially on 3 rd International Congress of Iranian Society for Reproductive Medicine in the panel of ethics (3, 4). Some of the most significant reasons expressed for the importance of clarity of donators' information described below: parentage being known, the principle of law and social rights, rule of truth expression, preventing unawareness incest, permanent anxiety for one of the families (donators or receptionists) etc. Accepting security of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> increases the risk of occurring items mentioned above (2, 5). To fix these problems, two solutions have recommended: 1. Creating a Bank of gametes 2. Avoiding security of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> from the beginning, in the other word the necessity of identifying the two families (the donor and the recipient of gametes) If you create a Bank of gametes, some issues such as incest, is still probable. So before the marriage, those resulted from assisted reproduction, should be introduced to certain centers to guide them not to marry with those who have paternal relationship which is a very important subject in Islam and Muslim nations. In fact according to Islamic rules it is unacceptable even if the probability is very low. In some European countries there is a law that limited the donators not to have more than ten receptionist family (6). So it is better that, children be aware from their biological parents, to {{be able to deal with}} this subject conveniently and act wisely. So such people will be avoided being exposed to some realities of their lives which they had not been aware of them until their marriage. The second method emphasizes on recognizing donators and recipients of gametes from the beginning. This will prevent all the probabilities and unwanted effects of security of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation.</b> In most Muslim countries, this solution seems to be more logical because there is not any tolerable reason on the dissimulating the information of two families (the donor and the recipient of gametes). In present statute in most Islamic countries such as Iran, <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> is still secured but there is no reason to continue in this method. So to prevent problems mentioned above and to clarify the paternity of people who are produced from this assisted method, it is recommend avoiding security of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation...</b>|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Springer via [URL] paper overviews key empirical findings from social science research regarding the impact of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> on child wellbeing. In particular, the paper addresses current regulatory debates concerning information sharing and {{the best interests of}} the child by considering psychosocial aspects of telling-or not telling-children about their donor conception and the identity of their donor. The paper identifies three core sets of empirical, ethical and policy concerns underpinning these debates relating to (i) the psychosocial impact of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> per se on child wellbeing, (ii) the psychosocial impact of parental disclosure decisions on child wellbeing, and (iii) the psychosocial implications of donor identification for donor-conceived offspring. The paper illustrates how these concerns are framed by ideas about the significance-or not-of 'genetic relatedness'; ideas which have come to the fore in contemporary discussions about the potential consequences of donor-conceived individuals gaining access to their donor's identity. By drawing together research findings that may be pertinent to the regulation of <b>gamete</b> <b>donation</b> and information sharing, a further aim of this paper is to explore the potential use and misuse of empirical 'evidence' in ethical and policy debates. Whilst this paper starts from the premise that psychosocial data has a vital role in grounding normative discussions, it seeks to contribute to this dialogue by highlighting both the value and limitations of social science research. In particular, the paper argues for a cautious approach to applying psychosocial evidence to ethical issues that is sensitive to the caveats and nuances of research findings and the changing cultural and regulatory context.
