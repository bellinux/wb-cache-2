500|$|Erin McWhirter of The Daily Telegraph called George's {{character}} [...] "outrageous" [...] {{in response}} to the appendectomy. Former Star-Ledger editor Alan Sepinwall was critical of the character, saying <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> eyes in regard to her letting the interns perform procedures on her, sarcastically writing: [...] "Ooooh, she's damaged! And sexy! She takes off her top and then eagerly cuts herself for the other interns! That's hot!" [...] TV Guide Erin Lulevitch referred to her as a [...] "masochist" [...] due to her self-incision.|$|E
500|$|In spring training, {{while he}} was batting [...]400, Kinsler slipped {{on a patch of}} wet grass during pre-game warm-ups. <b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> right ankle, and {{suffered}} a sprain of the ligaments above it (referred to as a [...] "high ankle sprain"), as well as a small bone bruise at the tip of his tibia {{at the back of his}} ankle. He missed three weeks of spring training, and began the season on the disabled list. Washington said: [...] "We miss his presence. We miss his threat. We miss what he brings on the defensive end. We miss his leadership." [...] He made his initial 2010 appearance on April 30, after having missed the first 20 games of the season.|$|E
500|$|Kippax was an [...] "impeccably {{correct and}} elegant batsman, [...] an upright, easy stance at the wicket; like his schoolboy idol Victor Trumper, <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> sleeves between wrist and elbow and excelled {{with the late}} cut", who was {{probably}} at his peak during the 1920s. His omission from the 1926 team to tour England caused great controversy at the time—especially as he hit a brilliant 271 not out against Victoria {{on the eve of}} selection. [...] Kippax was well into his thirties by the time he became a consistent selection for the Test team. Highly regarded by both fellow players and spectators, Kippax's innings of 83 in the Lord's Test of 1930 induced Neville Cardus to comment that, [...] "he pleased the eye of the connoisseur all the time." ...|$|E

60|$|The Joss doesn't like it. I can see that. Late at night, sometimes, {{he turns}} {{all sorts of}} queer colors--blue and green and red--just {{as he used to}} do when old Fung-Tching was alive; and <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>his</b> eyes and stamps his feet like a devil.|$|R
5000|$|Chance {{was working}} as track and field coach for a high school when Maj. Shepherd {{initially}} recruited him for the team's first mission. Maj.

2500|$|The Marlins {{initially}} assigned Miller to {{the bullpen}} in 2009 before inserting {{him into the}} starting rotation on April 15. [...] He injured his oblique muscle on April 20. [...] The club placed him {{on the disabled list}} and reactivated him on May 16. [...] He completed a season-high seven innings and tied a career-best with nine strikeouts versus the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 21. [...] Florida optioned him to the New Orleans Zephyrs on July 20, where he was 1–2 with a 5.79 ERA in 18.2 IP in five starts at the minor league level.

Violating orders from Grant, <b>he</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>his</b> troops out to meet Lee's army alone.

6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> back <b>his</b> sleeve to the armpit {{and showed}} the white scars of the vaccination-mark on his white skin. [...] "Come, all, and look." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> eyes ecstatically for a moment, then beamed {{upon them}} with a fatherly air.|$|E

5000|$|Mark {{changes the}} words in [...] "Carousel" [...] from [...] "I guess it's just another," [...] to [...] "I had sex with your mother."

6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> eyes round heavily, {{but he was}} too {{far gone}} to express surprise. All he could do was to utter one word, [...] "Brandy." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> from <b>his</b> {{blankets}} to {{get into}} boots and coat and rush out. The troopers appeared all around him in hurried orderly action. Neale asked a soldier what was up.|$|R

5000|$|Herky. Male. Yellow helicopter. In the {{original}} series, {{he spoke with}} a stutter (Like Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies Character Porky Pig).

60|$|Johnny spoke sweetly and placidly, and sweetly and placidly <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> over on <b>his</b> {{side and}} went to sleep.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>rolled</b> {{forward with}} <b>his</b> {{ponderous}} yet curiously noiseless gait. Scaramouche turned to her, smiling, {{and handed her}} the candle.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately, Dave {{had on a}} pair of gaiters he had borrowed, {{and they}} were so big that he slipped them off with ease. His socks followed, and then <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> up <b>his</b> {{trousers}} to his knees, and waded into the stream.|$|R
60|$|As a {{concession}} <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>his</b> sleeves down, dropped his icehooks on a syringa and went back. When Miss Van Meeker Constantia Coulson addressed him {{he took off}} his hat.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hear ye got ketched by some Shawnees?" [...] remarked another youth, as <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> up <b>his</b> shirt-sleeves. They {{all looked}} at Joe now. It was not improbably their {{estimate}} of him would be greatly influenced {{by the way he}} answered this question.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is nothing," [...] responded Mr. Lavender gallantly. And {{seeing that}} he was already wet, <b>he</b> <b>rolled</b> up <b>his</b> trousers, and holding up the tails of his holland coat, turned round and {{proceeded}} towards his hat, to the frantic delight of the crowd.|$|R
