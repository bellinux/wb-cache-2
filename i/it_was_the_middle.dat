5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the Chinese New Year, {{most of the}} Chinese Volunteers Corps were on leave, leaving Singapore almost defenceless {{against the}} mutiny. The British {{government}} was caught unprepared, and other mutineers went on a killing spree at Keppel Harbour and Pasir Panjang, killing 18 European and local civilians. Martial law was imposed and every available man from HMS Cadmus went ashore to join with British, Malay and Chinese Volunteer units and {{the small number of}} British regular troops forming part of the garrison. British Vice-Admiral Sir Martyn Jerram sent a radio message requesting help from any allied warships nearby.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders' {{march through}} Anatolia was {{thereafter}} unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything {{he left behind}} in his army's flight. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died. Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, {{but more often than}} not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the Cilician Gates, Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the Euphrates; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by Thoros of Edessa, a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his Greek Orthodox religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated. Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the County of Edessa, the first of the crusader states.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of September before Edward III {{received}} that word {{and returned to}} England, abandoning his immediate plans to attack Douglas of Liddesdale {{in light of the}} greater threat. Too late to strike at the French ships, Edward III aggressively raised funds and returned to Scotland, beginning a series of wins and losses of castles before settling to winter at the fortress in Clyde. Douglas of Liddesdale kept up a campaign of harassment against the king, while Murray destroyed Dunnottar, Kinneff and Lauriston in order to prevent Edward III using them to his own advantage. Famine and disease exacted harsh tolls throughout Scotland. In England, though French naval attacks were dying down, French political and legal pressures were increasing. Edward III again returned to England in December 1336 and began to plan a force to enter Gascony in the spring.|$|E

25|$|Jack Buck died on June 18, 2002, in St. Louis's Barnes-Jewish Hospital from a {{combination}} of illnesses. He had stayed in the hospital since January 3 of that year to undergo treatment for lung cancer, Parkinson's disease, and to correct an intestinal blockage. His death shook the St. Louis community: within two hours of his death, fans were leaving flowers {{at the base of his}} bust outside Busch Stadium even though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the night. The flags at St. Louis City Hall and the St. Louis County Government Center were lowered to half-staff, the local television news anchors all wore black suits for the next several days, and a public visitation was held in the stadium before the next baseball game after his death, with free admission to the game for all the mourners who filed past his coffin.|$|E
25|$|After the 1964 season, Chuck Fairbanks, an {{assistant}} coach at Houston, was offered a job at Tennessee. He wanted to accept, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the summer and unusually late for a coaching move, {{so he decided to}} stay loyal to Houston and remained there. After the next season, he was offered a position as {{an assistant}} on Mackenzie's staff at Oklahoma, a position he felt was a better job than the Tennessee position. Immediately after the 1965 season, Fairbanks was offered a job at Missouri with the promise that he would be the head coach within four years. He declined and stayed at Oklahoma. Four months later, Coach Mackenzie died and Fairbanks was named head coach. It did not take long for Fairbanks to turn the team around. In his first season in 1967, his squad went 10–1. They entered their sixth game with a 5–1 record (their only loss was a two-point loss to rival Texas) and unranked and beat ninth ranked Colorado, 23–0. This propelled Fairbanks's team to a number eight ranking. They continued their romp through the season and beat #2 Tennessee 26–24 in the Orange Bowl. They finished the season ranked number three in the country.|$|E
500|$|None of {{the party}} had any {{remaining}} faith in the Hastings Cutoff as they recovered at the springs {{on the other side}} of the desert. They spent several days trying to recover cattle, retrieve the wagons left in the desert, and transfer their food and supplies to other wagons. Reed's family incurred the heaviest losses, and Reed became more assertive, asking all the families to submit an inventory of their goods and food to him. He suggested that two men should go to Sutter's Fort in California; he had heard that John Sutter was exceedingly generous to wayward pioneers, and could assist them with extra provisions. Charles Stanton and William McCutchen volunteered to undertake the dangerous trip. The remaining serviceable wagons were pulled by mongrel teams of cows, oxen, and mules. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of September, and two young men who went in search of missing oxen reported that another [...] long stretch of desert lay ahead.|$|E

2500|$|French’s Cavalry Division {{consisted}} of three cavalry brigades and two brigades of mounted infantry, although the latter did not accompany them when they broke camp at 3am on 11 March—a separate provisional brigade of mounted infantry was provided instead. Roberts gave an inspirational speech to French’s brigade and regimental commanders. Rather than cross the Modder River directly (Kimberley lay around 25 miles north-east), they made an envelopment move: first over 20 miles south to Ramdam, then about 15 miles east to seize the Riet River Crossings, then about 25 miles (roughly north-north-east) to Klip Drift on the Modder, then another 20 miles north-west to Kimberley. [...] This was to be accomplished across arid land in five days, {{with much of the}} travel by moonlight as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of summer.

2500|$|At one {{of their}} clandestine {{meetings}} behind the old Arsenal (on what is now Capitol Hill in Salt Lake) on December 11, Coleman was discovered by [...] "friends" [...] of the woman. The group of vigilantes hit Coleman with a large rock. Using his own bowie knife, his attackers slit his throat so deeply {{from ear to ear}} that he was nearly decapitated, as well as slicing open his right breast, in what some believe was a mimicry of penalties illustrated in the temple ritual. Not all of Coleman's wounds correlated with the temple ritual, however, since he was also castrated. A pre-penciled placard was then pinned to his corpse stating [...] "NOTICE TO ALL NIGGERS - TAKE WARNING - LEAVE WHITE WOMEN ALONE." [...] Even though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of winter, a grave was dug and Coleman's body was buried. The body was disposed of in less than three hours after its discovery. Less than twelve hours after that, Judge Elias Smith, first cousin of Joseph Smith, appointed George Stringham (a Mormon ruffian and vigilante with ties to Porter Rockwell, Jason Luce, and William Hickman) as the foreman of the Coroner's Jury; they briefly met and summarily dismissed the case as a crime that was committed by either a person or by persons unknown to the jury, abruptly ending all official enquiry into the bizarre murder.|$|E

Webb spent two weeks [...] "trying to roll a coin across [...] fingers and [...] still couldn't do it", with Mitchell admitting that [...] "magic proved far more problematic than we anticipated". Webb stated that the worst part that he had to film [...] "was being buried up to the neck in sand. It's not the most comfortable place to be. I'd be buried for 30 minutes at a time, which doesn't sound that long, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of summer {{and there were a lot}} of wasps around." [...] Mitchell had to kiss Jessica Hynes in the film, but admitted that he would have preferred to have kissed Robert Webb as he had done in Peep Show, which he claimed to have been easier, as for that scene he had to [...] "look absolutely rigid at the time". On the subject of the scene with Hynes, he stated that [...] "the scene went surprisingly well considering we had to do it in front of 700 extras, but if I'd had a single moment more to think about it I'd have been mortified with embarrassment." [...] Whilst filming in Nottingham, unit signs being used in the film were repeatedly being stolen by teenagers as they had the word [...] "magic" [...] on them. Multiple signs had to be ordered, at £3 each. The magic shield competition takes place in Jersey, but the filming for these was done in Skegness.|$|E
