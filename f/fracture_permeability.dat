50|$|As {{discussed}} before, the <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> acts as {{the major}} channel for the gas to flow. The higher the permeability, the higher the gas production. For most coal seams found in the US, the permeability lies {{in the range of}} 0.1-50 milliDarcys. The permeability of fractured reservoirs changes with the stress applied to them. Coal displays a stress-sensitive permeability and this process plays an important role during stimulation and production operations.|$|E
30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> on process initiation, the <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> of “Off-set 9, High-Visc” {{which has been the}} high viscosity base case was increased fourfold to 10 D. Figure  8 illustrates the great advantageous impact of the higher <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> on the threshold of oil production. While in the case of “Off-set 9, High-Visc” oil production started after 4  years, this delay decreased to only 3  months in the case of higher <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability.</b> Moreover, final oil recovery reached 58  % at the end of 20  years compared to 38  % for the lower <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> case.|$|E
30|$|Matrix {{permeability}} is {{very critical}} such that permeabilities of 10 mD and higher {{result in more}} favorable results. The <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> affects the process less than the matrix permeability, and an effective <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> can increase the efficiency by 25  %.|$|E
30|$|To {{illustrate}} this, we {{have described}} a percolation test conducted on {{a sample of}} fractured granite (natural fracture showing signs of hydrothermal circulation). The test showed that the free face type dissolution of some minerals led, through a deepening of existing channels on the fracture walls, to an increase of the <b>fracture’s</b> <b>permeability</b> by one order of magnitude and {{to a change in}} its hydromechanical behaviour.|$|R

It pointed out that calculating the porosity and permeability for low permeability reservoir based on FZ and building the 3 D discrete fracture network (DFN) distribution model integrated with the static fracture character and the density distribution of high angle fracture (HAF) and low angle fracture (LAF) are efficient methods for <b>fractured</b> low <b>permeability</b> reservoir. This brings forward the use of FZ and considerable sequence stratigraphy controlled modeling method, and brings forward to build fracture surface from point which controlled by the density distribution of HAF and LAF.

30|$|Different {{behaviour}} of the <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> in {{the first}} versus subsequent loading cycles in the ductile rock suggests that different <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> closure laws might be applicable for mature fractures and fresh (newly created) fractures. The hysteresis in the mechanical behaviour of a fracture and in the <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> under cyclic normal loading is known from experiments. An example is provided in (Gangi 1978) where it was attributed to the breakage of asperities {{in the first}} cycle. In our model of the ‘ductile rock’, the asperities irreversibly deform rather than break. It {{should be noted that}} irreversible (hysteretic) behaviour of <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> was observed also in experiments on brittle rocks, e.g. (Scholz and Hickman 1983).|$|E
30|$|Hysteresis in the <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> versus {{normal stress}} {{exhibited}} by the ductile rock suggests that caution should be exercised when transferring the results of laboratory measurements of the <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> under stress onto in situ (reservoir) conditions. The rock could {{have been subject to}} a complex loading history in situ. Performing a single loading in the laboratory with an uncomplicated stress path is therefore likely to produce the <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> figures that are not very representative for an in situ fracture.|$|E

30|$|The {{constants}} C 1 and C 2 in Eq. (9) are {{the correction}} factors {{that need to}} be determined from numerical simulation and sensitivity analysis. Using the Eq. (9), natural <b>fractures</b> <b>permeability</b> can be estimated as function of average permeability × thickness (from welltest analysis) and average fracture spacing and aperture (from image log processing results). Once the natural fracture parameters are estimated, then using Eqs. (1) and (2) fracture storativity ratio and interporosity flow coefficient can be estimated for welltest design applications, well productivity evaluation, and gas production rate forecasting.|$|R

30|$|The {{most common}} {{settings}} for geothermal {{systems in the}} Great Basin region are fault terminations, fault step-overs, fault intersections, accommodation zones, displacement transfer zones, and pull-aparts (Faulds et al. 2006, 2011; Faulds and Hinz 2015). These are sites with inherent structural complexity, exemplified by a high local density of interconnected faults and <b>fractures.</b> <b>Permeability</b> is greater in these areas, and this is beneficial for the development and maintenance of fluid upflow pathways along faults (Faulds et al. 2006, 2013; Coolbaugh et al. 2007; Lechler and Coolbaugh 2007; Jolie et al. 2015 a, b; Siler et al. 2018).|$|R

30|$|The {{objectives}} of this study, {{in addition to}} demonstrating {{the viability of the}} computational approach, were as follows: to look into the effect of rock ductility (plasticity) on <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> under normal stress; to look into the effect that normal stress might have on the roughness-induced anisotropy of the <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability,</b> in a relatively brittle rock and in a relatively ductile rock.|$|E
40|$|Fracture {{networks}} have been characterized as highly permeable continuum within the porous rock matrix in thermal-hydrologic models {{used to support}} performance assessments of the proposed nuclear-waste repository at Yucca Mountain. Uncertainty and spatial variability of the <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> are important considerations for understanding thermal-hydrologic behavior within the host rock surrounding an emplacement drift. In this paper, we conducted numerical experiments {{with a number of}} realizations of intrinsic <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> and examine thermal conditions around an emplacement drift. Peak temperature and boiling duration on the drift wall are used as indices to quantify, the influence of <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability.</b> The variability of peak temperature and boiling duration resulting from small-scale fracture-permeability heterogeneity is compared with the variability resulting from variability of host-rock thermal conductivity and infiltration flux. An examination of rock dryout and condensate drainage shows that small-scale heterogeneity in <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> results in a relatively small range in dryout volume and does not prevent the shedding of condensate through the pillar-separating emplacement drifts...|$|E

Experimental measurements were undertaken in CBM cores from Kazakhstan (Karaganda Basin). The experimental results showed a strong correspondence between measured magnetic susceptibility and permeability of the CBM core samples. Inverse correlation between magnetic susceptibility and permeability is observed. Generally, the high values of MS correspond to low permeability, likewise the low diamagnetic MS relates to high permeability of production zones. In case of <b>fracturing</b> <b>permeability</b> must be recalculated in relation to the degree of fracturing...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} in tight, naturally fractured reservoirs is {{a difficult}} process and qualifying effectiveness {{in such an environment}} is complicated. Through evaluation of naturally fractured shale and naturally fractured sandstone case studies, we will show how hydraulic fracturing effectiveness in naturally fractured reservoirs can be qualified. For this evaluation, we will use lumped and fully three-dimensional (3 D) hydraulic fracturing models, analytic bottomhole treating pressure analysis techniques, analytical reservoir models, and finite-difference reservoir simulation. When used together, these techniques can characterize negative effects that can occur to the natural fracture system during the hydraulic fracturing process. These effects relate to the extent of natural <b>fracturing,</b> <b>permeability</b> anisotropy, pressure dependent leakoff, and natural fracture damage...|$|R

And {{the effects of}} stress-sensitive coefficient, matrix <b>permeability,</b> <b>fracture</b> half-length and conductivity on gas production have been investigated, which draws a significant instruction for fracturing stimulation. Gas production and open flow are affected in different extents by stress-sensitive coefficient, matrix <b>permeability,</b> <b>fracture</b> half-length and conductivity. They are positively correlative with matrix <b>permeability,</b> <b>fracture</b> half-length and conductivity, but negatively related with stress-sensitive coefficient. In the factors we investigated, matrix permeability leads {{the list of the}} effects on gas production and open flow. The gas well in extremely low-permeability area cannot achieve the production of industrial value for exploitation even after fracturing unless multistage fracturing was conducted or complicated fractures were generated.|$|R

30|$|Unloading of a fracture, i.e. {{reduction}} in the normal stress, is usually accompanied with hysteresis in the fracture permeability: the <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> is different during unloading {{from what it was}} at the same stress during loading (Gutierrez et al. 2000). Hysteresis of the <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> under normal loading is a manifestation of a more general irreversibility of rock deformation that also includes, for example, the ‘stress-memory’ capacity of rocks (Becker et al. 2010; Lavrov 2005).|$|E
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that in this case, the image log {{fracture}} parameters might be different compared with fracture parameters during the pressure transient testing. Injection of water prior to pressure fall-off test may have increased aperture of natural fractures in the water invaded reservoir zone around wellbore (over estimating actual <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> from welltest data). In the case of pressure drawdown followed by pressure build-up, the results for <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> might be different.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} several {{test cases}} {{intended to be}} benchmarks for numerical schemes for single-phase fluid flow in fractured porous media. A number of solution strategies are compared, including a vertex and a cell-centered finite volume method, a non-conforming embedded discrete fracture model, a primal and a dual extended finite element formulation, and a mortar discrete fracture model. The proposed benchmarks test the schemes by increasing the difficulties in terms of network geometry, e. g. intersecting fractures, and physical parameters, e. g. low and high fracture-matrix permeability ratio as well as heterogeneous <b>fracture</b> <b>permeabilities.</b> For each problem, the results presented by the participants are the number of unknowns, the approximation errors in the porous matrix and in the fractures {{with respect to a}} reference solution, and the sparsity and condition number of the discretized linear system.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{three-dimensional}} modeling study of gas {{flow in the}} unsaturated fractured rock of Yucca Mountain. Our objective is to estimate large-scale <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability,</b> using the changes in subsurface pneumatic pressure in response to barometric pressure changes at the land surface. We incorporate the field-measured pneumatic data into a multiphase flow model for describing the coupled processes of liquid and gas flow under ambient geothermal conditions. Comparison of field-measured pneumatic data with model-predicted gas pressures {{is found to be}} a powerful technique for estimating the <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> of the unsaturated fractured rock, which is otherwise extremely difficult to determine on the large scales of interest. In addition, this study demonstrates that the multi-dimensional-flow effect on estimated permeability values is significant and should be included when determining <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> in heterogeneous fractured media...|$|E
40|$|Several factors {{will affect}} Thermal-Hydrological (TH) {{response}} of the Unsaturated Zone (UZ) to thermal load at the potential repository. These factors include small and large-scale heterogeneity, the thermal load within the repository drifts and presence of lithophysal cavities. The objective {{of this study is}} to quantify these effects. Numerical modeling was used to investigate the effects of heat on UZ flow, temperature and liquid saturation on two spatial scales, for a range of potential repository operating modes. The TH simulations were conducted on two dual-permeability numerical grids. The first grid is a refined North-South Mountain-scale 2 D model with layer-wise constant <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability.</b> The second grid is a refined half-drift (1 -m grid near drift) 2 D model with several realizations of spatially variable <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> in the Topopah Spring welded unit (TSw). In the TSw lithophysal units, the thermal capacity and thermal conductivity of the lithophysal units were scaled using the lithophysal porosity. The second model includes both small-scale (less than 1 -meter correlation length) heterogeneity in the <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> and discrete high permeability fractures. Monte Carlo methods were used to generate several realizations of spatially variable <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> (up to 4 orders of magnitude) in the TSw, based on the measured distribution of <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> within the exploration drifts. Above boiling and below boiling repository operating modes are investigated by varying the initial thermal load and the amount of heat removed by ventilation. The simulations of coupled heat and mass flow were conducted using TOUGH 2 (EOS 3 module) over a simulated period of 100, 000 years...|$|E

Furthermore, this feature has a significant effect on the steam chamber expansion throughout the operation period as well.|$|R
30|$|Failure {{criteria}} are arguably {{most important for}} the numerical modelling of <b>fracturing,</b> <b>permeability</b> and induced seismicity scenarios in reservoirs. For modelling the rock mass as a continuum (as for the matrix in modelling of Deisman et al. 2013; Yoon et al. 2014; Siratovich et al. 2016; Insana et al. 2016) {{the scale of the}} model should be considered according to the two scale criteria we employed in this research. The numerical modelling in Siratovich et al. (2016) was conducted at well scale using an intact rock failure criterion, and would only be applicable for rock masses meeting the first scale criterion. The numerical modelling by Yoon et al. (2014) was conducted at reservoir scale using a discontinuum method that incorporates both fracture-specific and rock continuum (in their case intact rock) failure criteria. The discontinuum method is appropriate for discrete faults or fractures, but for distributed intensely fractured zones, such as those observed in the URG, an equivalent continuum for the rock mass may be more appropriate.|$|R
30|$|Naturally {{fractured}} reservoir (NFR) can {{be defined}} as a reservoir contains a connected network of fractures created by natural processes and proved to have an effect on fluid flow (Javadpour 2009; Sun et al. 2016). NFR contains more than 20  % of the world’s hydrocarbon reserves (Sarma and Aziz 2006). Shale gas reservoir generally contains natural fractures; thus, shale gas reservoir can be classified into NFR. In shales, natural <b>fractures</b> provide <b>permeability</b> and the matrix provides storage for most of the gas (Bello and Wattenbarger 2010). The gas molecules are stored by a combination of compression in the pores and adsorption {{on the surface of the}} solid shale matter (Bello and Wattenbarger 2008). It is believed that compared to the induced <b>fractures,</b> the <b>permeability</b> of natural <b>fractures</b> is too small to be considered. Yet this is proved to be wrong because the natural fracture network can actually enhance the productivity of the reservoir greatly (Cipolla et al. 2010); thus, the local natural fractures shall not be ignored.|$|R
30|$|A {{computational}} framework {{for evaluating the}} <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> under normal stress has been developed and tested on two examples: a perfectly elastic (‘brittle’) rock and an elastic perfectly plastic (‘ductile’) rock. The two types of rock exhibit significantly different behaviour of <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> under repeated loading. Both mechanical and hydraulic behaviours of the fracture under cyclic normal loading {{are found to be}} in qualitative agreement with the results obtained in a number of published experimental studies. The computational approach provides an insight into the actual mechanics of the fracture deformation under stress, and the effect of the latter on the permeability. In particular, a hysteresis in the fracture roughness is obtained with the ‘ductile rock’, suggesting that (at least some) fractured rocks may have ‘memory’ about their loading history imprinted in the fracture landscapes. The anisotropy of <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability</b> is reduced as the fracture opens and is increased as the normal stress increases. During repeated loading/unloading of a fracture in a ductile rock, asperities are smoothed out. Therefore, repeated loading/unloading cycles reduce the flow tortuosity and the anisotropy of the <b>fracture</b> <b>permeability.</b> The effect of repeated loading of a ductile rock is also to compress the statistical distribution of the local fracture apertures.|$|E

40|$|Modeling {{multiphase}} flow through fractures {{is a key}} issue for understanding flow mechanism and performance prediction of fractured petroleum reservoirs, geothermal reservoirs, underground aquifers and carbon-dioxide sequestration. One {{of the most challenging}} subjects in modeling of fractured petroleum reservoirs is quantifying fluids competition for flow in <b>fracture</b> network (relative <b>permeability</b> curves). Unfortunately, there is no standard technique for experimental measurement of relative <b>permeabilities</b> through <b>fractures</b> and the existing methods are very expensive, time consuming and erroneous. Although, several formulations were presented to calculate <b>fracture</b> relative <b>permeability</b> curves in the form of linear and power functions of flowing fluids saturation, it is still unclear what form of relative permeability curves must be used for proper modeling of flow through fractures and consequently accurate reservoir simulation. Basically, the classic linear relative permeability (X-type) curves are used in almost all of reservoir simulators. In this work, basic fluid flow equations are combined to develop a new simple analytical model for water-oil two phase flow in a single fracture. The model gives rise to simple analytic formulations for <b>fracture</b> relative <b>permeabilities.</b> The model explicitly proves that water-oil relative <b>permeabilities</b> in <b>fracture</b> network are functions of fluids saturation, viscosity ratio, fluids density, inclination of fracture plane from horizon, pressure gradient along fracture and rock matrix wettability, however they were considered to be only functions of saturations in the classic X-type and power (Corey [35] and Honarpour et al. [28, 29]) models. Eventually, validity of the proposed formulations is checked against literature experimental data. The proposed <b>fracture</b> relative <b>permeability</b> functions have several advantages over the existing ones. Firstly, they are explicit functions of the parameters which are known for each of simulation computational cells or easy to measure in laboratory. It is also the first model that takes gravity effects and wettability of fracture walls into consideration and individually developed for water and oil-wet systems. Furthermore, the newly developed formulations are simple, efficient and accurate. Thus, they are recommended for implementation in dual and multiple continuum commercial reservoir simulators...|$|R
