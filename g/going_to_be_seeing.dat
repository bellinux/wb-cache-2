[...] "It was going to be a whole new show in the sense that we were going to be training some young people, Bob was going to be training some people for a whole new organization. Jonas was finally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> his run end......The final season was going to be, I figured the fifth season was going to be the last... It was going to be a long, sort of final mission for Jonas. He's not medically cleared, Mack has to go in and sort of change the medical records so that Jonas can keep on [...] We had a whole thing planned, it was going to be good." [...] Jonas would eventually leave the army due to his injuries coupled with combat stress and reunite with Molly. Mack would take over the team but at the end of the series would also leave for a training post after Tiffy becomes pregnant with their third child. Bob would be badly injured in a parachuting accident and join the CIA as their Unit liaison. Ryan would take a demotion to regain control of The Unit whilst Bridget Sullivan would be killed on a mission halfway through the season. Charles Grey would take over as team leader with Sam McBride as his deputy training replacements for the personnel they have lost.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} game of the month Vancouver played the Rangers and former coach Alain Vigneault. Daniel Sedin said of the game: [...] "I know our former coach is over there, but once you get into the game you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> think too much about it. He was with us for seven years and he meant a lot to this franchise, so it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fun <b>seeing</b> him again but once the game gets going we want the two points, and so does he". Tortarella stated: [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lie, it's a little weird for me coming back, but once the game starts, it's about playing and {{trying to find a way}} to get a win". The Canucks lost the game 5–2, {{finishing}} the month with 31 points, four points out of the final playoff spot.|$|R

A picture surfaced that revealed the fan offering a banana to the 37-year-old {{as he entered the}} pitch, however Russian journalist Boris Bogdanov argued against the allegations of racism, citing that the picture was taken at an [...] "unfavorable angle" [...] and it could not be known for sure if his intention <b>was</b> <b>to</b> offend. Even though there had been incidents of banana-throwing in Saint Petersburg before, there were none during the Anzhi match or any other sort of incident.

5000|$|In spring {{training}} 2009, Balester {{was part of}} a battle with Jordan Zimmermann and Shairon Martis for the final two spots in the Nationals rotation. However, he eventually lost the battle and was optioned to the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs to begin the season. During Spring training, he went 1-1 with a 6.75 ERA, prompting Nationals manager Manny Acta to state that, [...] "We need Collin to go down there and get some consistency on his command and three pitches. He took the news very well. He is going to go down there and work hard. I'm sure we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> him this year and for years to come." [...] On July 23, after Zimmermann was placed on the 15-day disabled list, Balester was called up to take his place in the rotation. On August 25, the Nationals signed Liván Hernández from free agency and to make room on the roster, optioned Balester to Triple-A. In seven starts for the Nationals in 2009, he went 1-4 with a 6.82 ERA. While with Syracuse, Balester strained a muscle on his left side, which ended his season. In 20 total starts with the Chiefs, he went 7-10 with a 4.44 ERA.|$|E

A high proportion of primary care visits involve behavioral problems, requiring us to quickly and confidently distinguish between medical/neurological causes and primary psychiatric conditions. So it is essential that we devise realistic strategies for walking into the examining room in total ignorance of the diagnosis and walking out 15 minutes later with a plan. Naturally, we need flexibility. Some things simply demand more time, perhaps not as much for diagnosis as for negotiating the exchange of huma...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 21 - 22) Since the day I saw In The Heights, I {{have believed}} that all we Latino artists need {{is the opportunity to}} tell our stories. And it has piqued my interest to explore the path that led to Miranda's breakthrough musical about an extended Latino family living in Washington Heights, Manhattan, {{in the early part of}} the 21 st Century. This project report will examine the Latino image in musical theatre from the negative stereotyped roles of gang members and criminals to an integrated society of family and home. To support my ideas I have referenced the journal articles: "Hispanics on Broadway" by Robert Dominguez, "Latinos Conquer Broadway with In the Heights'" by Ed Morales, and the book Contemporary Latina/o Theater: Wrighting Ethnicity by Jon D. Rossini. While researching this subject I found my personal background with the culture to be very beneficial. Growing up seeing the concerts of Tito Puentes, Cheo Feliciano, and having the opportunity of meeting Hector Lavoe, Celia Cruz and Oscar D'Leon supports my knowledge and point of view of Latina/o performers in musical theatre. Chapter Two focuses on the background of Latino culture and the use of it as part of a plot in West Side Story. Chapter Three examines the Chicano/Mexican culture and the play Zoot Suit and the riots in Los Angeles in the 1950 s. Chapter Four illuminates the dark story and the Broadway musical flop The Capeman written and produced by Paul Simon. Chapter Five approaches the new and authentic image of a Latino community in the American musical theatre with the Tony Award musical In the Heights. Lin-Manuel Miranda proved that Hispanic culture is not only acceptable, but a perfect subject for an American Broadway musical. I am anticipating even more great things from Miranda, but I am sure we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> more creative Latino artists as a result of his efforts...|$|E
