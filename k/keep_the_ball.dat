5|$|Coach Friedgen named Smith {{the special}} teams captain for the Virginia game. During the game, Virginia chose to kick short to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> away from Smith on kickoffs, and quarterback Chris Turner did not target him until the fourth quarter. He {{finished}} with three receptions for 34yards and no returns. He recorded two receptions for 13yards at Duke. At NC State, he caught eight passes for 64yards and returned a kickoff 84yards for a touchdown. During the game, he surpassed the ACC single-season kickoff return yards record {{which he had}} set the previous season. He had four receptions for 55yards against 21st-ranked Virginia Tech, seven receptions for 71yards against Florida State, and six receptions for 68yards and a touchdown against Boston College.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{started the}} match through {{kick-off}} Henry. There {{minutes into the}} match, captain Tony Adams attempted to clear the ball via a header, only for it to land at Arif Erdem, who attempted a volley shot outside the Arsenal area, deflecting off the goal post. As a result, Galatasaray were awarded a corner. Erdem took it, but failed to trouble the defense, as the ball was easily cleared away. Arsenal responded via Bergkamp, who received the ball from Marc Overmars; Bergkamp attempted to outrun Galatasaray defenders Capone and Gheorghe Popescu and into their area, only to be unable to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in match play. Arsenal even fashioned more chances, as Overmars won a one-on-one encounter against Capone, trying to reach Bergkamp, but the ball was easily read by Popescu for a corner. The corner was came to nothing, as Patrick Vieira tried to hit the ball, before it landed for an opportunity for Henry, whose shot went over the goal post. A third of the match played, Arsenal were awarded a free-kick opportunity, after Okan Buruk received a yellow card for committing a sliding tackle on Vieira.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{season the}} club surpassed {{the achievements of}} the previous season, finishing fourth in the league and again reaching the FA Cup final, this time facing Birmingham City. Conscious that early nerves had affected his team in 1955, in the dressing room he focussed on instilling each member of his team with confidence. This time it was Manchester City who scored an early goal, and with City leading in the second half Paul told his men to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in play as much as possible in order to tire out the Birmingham players. Then German goalkeeper Bert Trautmann badly hurt his neck in a collision with Peter Murphy. Paul instructed Roy Little to take Trautmann's place, but Trautmann insisted that he would keep playing. Then Manchester City held on for the victory, and Paul collected the trophy from Queen Elizabeth II. X-rays later revealed that Trautmann had played on with a broken neck. Paul took the match ball from the final as a souvenir, and gave it to his son.|$|E

50|$|A running play {{occurs when}} the quarterback hands <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to another player, who then {{attempts}} to carry <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> past <b>the</b> line of scrimmage and gain yards, or <b>the</b> quarterback <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> himself and runs beyond the line of scrimmage.

25|$|The {{rules of}} the ballgame are not known, but it was {{probably}} similar to volleyball, where {{the object is to}} <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in play. In the most well-known version of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, although some versions used forearms or employed rackets, bats, or handstones. The ball was made of solid rubber, and weighed up to 4kg or more, with sizes that differed greatly over time or according to the version played.|$|E
50|$|In {{sports such}} as {{football}} and basketball, the adage is used to note that success can hinge on an effective offense that <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on <b>the</b> other team's side of the field, thus not only creating scoring opportunities but preventing the opposing team from scoring.|$|R

5000|$|Protecting one's stick {{from being}} checked {{is a very}} {{important}} key in the game of women's lacrosse.

25|$|Washington took {{advantage}} of two key penalties against the Lions on their first drive as they drove 79 yards to score on Davis' 1-yard touchdown run. The first was a running into the punter penalty against linebacker Clint Kriewaldt that enabled them to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> and the second was a 41-yard pass interference penalty on Lions defensive back Bryant Westbrook. The next time Washington got the ball, they drove 87 yards, featuring a 58-yard run by Davis, and scored with another Davis touchdown run to take a 14–0 lead.|$|E
25|$|This game {{featured}} several questionable calls by officials. On one play, Jackson batted {{the ball}} forward {{along the ground}} after making a reception, and San Diego recovered it, but officials ruled Jackson's action to be an illegal forward pass rather than a botched lateral, allowing Miami to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Later on, Chargers receiver Shawn Jefferson caught a 37-yard touchdown pass, but the referees ruled him out of bounds even though replays showed he was in. And on Means' 24-yard touchdown run, replays showed he had stepped out of bounds at the 2.|$|E
50|$|A {{very popular}} type of double option is the Read Option. It is {{typically}} {{run out of}} the shotgun formation. The quarterback reads the defensive end on the side in which the play is designed to take the running back. If the defensive end is playing outside the tackle after the snap of <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>the</b> quarterback hands <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> off to <b>the</b> running back. If the defensive end is playing inside of the tackle after the snap, <b>the</b> quarterback <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and runs counter to the blocking scheme.|$|R

In the slice department, she {{has the ability to}} <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> low and performs the shot better on her backhand wing. Due to her tall frame, she is known to make up for her lack of speed by playing close to the baseline. Her game suits the fast courts and she cites grass as her favourite surface.|$|E
25|$|Florida {{continued}} to struggle against Nebraska's aggressive, blitzing defense. In the third period, on second {{down from the}} Nebraska 25, Cornhuskers quarterback Frazier ran an option play to the right, and decided to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> rather than pitch. He gained 11 yards before being met {{by a group of}} Florida defenders at the 36-yard line, which he then dragged approximately 10 yards before shrugging them off and breaking free, streaking 75 yards down the sideline to give Nebraska a 49–18 lead. Frazier had broken no fewer than seven tackles on the play. The game ended 62 to 24.|$|E
25|$|Galli cricket, which {{literally}} means lane cricket, {{is a type}} of {{the backyard}} cricket popular in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, except that it is often played on the busy narrow inner lanes, and sometimes even on the main roads, of the suburbs and cities, shared with pedestrians, rickshaws, vehicular traffic, cows, pets and stray animals with cacophony of sights, sounds and colors. It is often played with the soft tennis ball, improvised wickets and bat, where rules are flexible, and hitting in the air or the to the wall, specially on someone's window pane glass is considered out. Kids would often get a scolding from the neighbors whose window pane glasses are broken, thus scoring rules are designed to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on the ground.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the game}} uses a white ball {{instead of the}} red one used in {{first-class}} cricket, the ball can become discoloured and hard to see as the innings progresses, so the ICC has used various rules to help <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> playable. Most recently, ICC has made the use of two new balls (one from each end), the same strategy {{that was used in}} the 1992 and 1996 World Cups so that each ball is used for only 25 overs. Previously, in October 2007, the ICC sanctioned that after the 34th over, the ball would be replaced with a cleaned previously-used ball. Before October 2007 (except 1992 and 1996 World Cups), only one ball would be used during an innings of an ODI and it was up to the umpire to decide whether to change the ball.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Texas {{head coach}} Darrell Royal and his {{offensive}} coordinator Emory Bellard introduced {{what would become}} known as the wishbone offense. The wishbone was derived from the Split-T offense run at Oklahoma under Bud Wilkinson. In the formation, the quarterback lines up with a fullback and two tailbacks behind him, and on any play may <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> hand off to the fullback, or pitch to a tailback. From the time Bryant arrived at Alabama through the 1970 season, the Crimson Tide ran a pro-style offense. By 1969, Bryant began to recruit larger linemen and tailbacks, and after a pair of six win seasons in 1969 and 1970, Bryant saw the success of the wishbone for the Longhorns and decided to implement the offense for the 1971 season. In spring 1971, Alabama assistants Mal Moore and Jimmy Sharpe traveled to Austin where they saw first hand how the wishbone operated during Texas' final week of spring practice.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} play of the second quarter, Chris Brown ran into the endzone for a Sooner touchdown. Garrett Hartley punched in the extra point to make it 7–3, Oklahoma. Missouri then put {{together}} a 14play drive, but failed to score a touchdown. They had the ball, first and goal, at the Oklahoma 9. Daniel chose to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and ran it up the middle for an apparent score. However, the officials ruled that when his knee touched the ground, the ball had not broken {{the plane of the}} goal line, and the ball was spotted at the 1yard line. The Sooners' defense then kept the Tigers out of the endzone, ultimately forcing another Wolfert field goal. The score at this point was 7–6, Oklahoma. The Sooners got the ball but could not do anything with it, punting it away from the 50-yard line. Missouri promptly threw three incomplete passes and punted it back to Oklahoma, where it went out of bounds at the 50. Oklahoma passed its way into the redzone on this drive, and then rushed their way into the endzone, ending with a 2yard play by Chris Brown for the score. Hartley's extra point was good, making the score 14–6, Oklahoma. With 3:06 left in the half, Mizzou pressed down the field, aided by a pass to Martin Rucker for 13yards, to which an Oklahoma 15yard facemask penalty was added. The Tigers ended up on the Oklahoma 4yard line, where Missouri set up for the pass, spreading the Sooners' defense out. This let Chase Daniel easily jog across the goal line for a touchdown. Interestingly, the Tigers decided to go for a two-point conversion and the tie, rather than attempt the almost sure kick and trail by one at the half. The play was a double reverse; Jeremy Maclin ended up with the ball and passed it to Martin Rucker, who was wide open in the endzone. Oklahoma got the ball back with 5 seconds on the clock and took a knee, ending the first half with a score of 14–14.|$|E
2500|$|With most players, the [...] handle runs {{across the}} palm of the [...] hand and rests against <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> of <b>the</b> thumb.
