On using Lennertz's theme, McCreary said, [...] "I was excited {{for the opportunity to}} incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [...] Universe together as a coherent whole ... Chris was thrilled and sent me his scores for reference." [...] On his use of the theme, McCreary stated, as Carter [...] "storms in, the first violins state an elongated version of her theme soaring above an aggressive, orchestral ostinato". McCreary also introduced a new Hydra theme in the episode that represents Daniel Whitehall, and is used in scenes featuring the Obelisk and Carl Creel. About the theme, McCreary said [...] "In true bad-guy-theme fashion, the theme is constructed from distantly related minor chords, and contains lots of close intervals. <b>I</b> <b>build</b> a theme like this so it can easily [...] into increasingly dissonant variations. For example, the E in the C minor chord will clash against the E minor, as will the B in the G minor chord. Building the theme in this way means that, in the future, I can put this theme over any pedal tone bass note and it will always sound dissonant." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1863 Carson and John Dolbeer {{formed the}} Dolbeer and Carson Lumber Company. Eighteen {{years later in}} 1881, as the company {{advanced}} into areas more difficult to log, Dolbeer invented the Steam Donkey Engine which revolutionized log removal, especially in hard to reach areas. At about the same time, Carson {{was involved in the}} founding of the Eel River and Eureka Railroad with John Vance. Before commencing the building of his mansion, Carson said, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>build</b> it poorly, they would say that I am a damned miser; if <b>I</b> <b>build</b> it expensively, they will say I'm a show off; guess I'll just build it to suit myself." [...] In 1884, on the eve of construction of the great home, the company was producing [...] of lumber annually. The milling operations, combined with additional investments as far away as Southern California and at least partial ownerships in schooners used to move the lumber to booming markets on the west coast and all over the globe, {{set the stage for the}} unlimited budget and access to resources the builders would have. Pacific Lumber Company purchased the company in 1950 and maintained milling operations at the original Humboldt Bay site, located bay-side below the house, well into the 1970s. Following the Carson family divestiture of remaining family holdings (including the home) in 1950, the family left the area. The building was purchased for $35,000 in 1950 by local community business leaders, and currently houses the Ingomar Club, a private club, which was named after Carson's Ingomar Theater, itself named for Carson's favorite play Ingomar the Barbarian.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example of}} {{language}} foregrounding authority by {{references to the}} crown and throne is found in Act 2, Scene 1, as Edward laments {{the death of his}} father; [...] "His dukedom and his chair with me is left" [...] (l.90), to which Richard answers, specifically foregrounding the issue of language and the importance of words, [...] "For 'chair and dukedom', 'throne and kingdom' say" [...] (l.93). Warwick says something similar later in the scene, calling Edward [...] "No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;/The next degree is England's royal throne" [...] (l.192–193). After decapitating York, Margaret points out the head to Henry, saying, [...] "Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy/That sought to be encumbered with your crown" [...] (2.2.2–3). Later, Edward asks Henry, [...] "Wilt thou kneel for grace/And set thy diadem upon my head?" [...] (2.2.81–82). Edward then says to Margaret, [...] "You that are king, though he do wear the crown" [...] (2.2.90). Later, in Act 2, Scene 6, when Edward is blaming Margaret for the civil war, he says to Henry that if she hadn't provoked the House of York [...] "thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace" [...] (l.19). He then says to Warwick, [...] "For in thy shoulder do <b>I</b> <b>build</b> my seat" [...] (l.99). In Act 3, Scene 1, Henry then debates with the gamekeepers the importance of the crown to the role of kingship; ...|$|E
