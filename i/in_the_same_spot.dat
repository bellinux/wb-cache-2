In the 1933 film, {{an ad for}} Columbia Pictures {{appeared}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spot,</b> and the production designers replicated it, but Columbia asked for {{a large amount of}} money for its use, so effects artists replaced it.|$|E
5|$|The {{temperature}} of {{a lightning bolt}} can be five times hotter than {{the surface of the}} sun. Although the lightning is extremely hot, the duration is short and 90% of strike victims survive. Contrary to the popular idea that lightning does not strike twice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spot,</b> some people have been struck by lightning over three times, and skyscrapers like the Empire State Building have been struck numerous times in the same storm.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{annotation}} of {{the stone}} is in a church inventory from 1829, and it says that the stone was illegible. Ljungström documented in 1861 {{that it was in}} the rock fence with the inscription facing the cemetery. When Djurklou visited the stone in 1869, it was still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spot.</b> Djurklou considered its placement to be unhelpful because a part of the runic band was buried in the soil, so he commanded an honourable farmer to select a group of men and remove the stone from the wall. The next time Djurklou visited the location, he found the stone raised in the cemetery.|$|E

50|$|Pottersville {{was founded}} on March 25, 1799 {{as a part of}} the Town of Chester, Warren County. The town was mainly agricultural; most {{families}} owned livestock, such as sheep, for access to clothing material. Carding mills and tanneries were eventually built as the first forms of manufacturing outside of <b>the</b> home. <b>In</b> 1805, roads connecting Town of Chester were opened and are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> today.|$|R
50|$|The lemon pansy is a {{very active}} {{butterfly}} and can be seen basking with its wings open facing the sun. It sits very {{low to the ground}} and can be approached easily. It feeds with its wings half open. It is a fairly strong flier and flies close to the ground with rapid wingbeats and often returns to settle back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spots.</b>|$|R
5|$|When a storm begins, {{the crew}} start to set sail. Toby drops a {{polished}} crown while bringing his father a coat. The Siren is summoned and takes Toby. Soon, Rory {{falls into the}} ocean, and the Doctor rationalises that the Siren has shown intelligence and will likely get to Rory before he drowns and convinces her to save him. Believing the victims are not dead, the Doctor convinces Avery and Amy to prick themselves to get the Siren to take them. The Doctor's suspicions are confirmed when the Siren's touch actually teleports them to an alien spaceship, invisible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> the pirate ship is located.|$|E
5|$|Among the Pagans {{who use the}} Coldrum Stones {{for their}} ritual activities, there is general {{satisfaction}} with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in {{the centre of the}} monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.|$|E
5|$|Miran Pastourma is a famed pastourma and sujuk charcuterie {{business}} and market in Athens, Greece. The {{market has been}} in operation since 1922. It is considered the charcuterie of the connoisseurs. Despite the Greek economic crisis, Miran is expanding its {{business and}} has doubled in size to accommodate increased demand. The founder of the shop, Miran Kourounlian, {{is thought to be}} the man who brought pastourma to Athens for the first time. Miran is considered the largest company {{of its kind in the}} European Union. The flavour of pastourma coming from the historical enterprise permeates Euripides Street in the centre of Athens. Miran and its neighbor Arapian Cold Cuts are considered two of the historical establishments of Athens. Miran has been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> in Euripidou Street since its opening in 1922. Miran is the recipient of multiple gourmet prizes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{video for}} [...] "The Sweetest Days" [...] is shot in two {{different}} ways. The [...] "romantic version" [...] was shot in an apartment overlooking a city skyline while the [...] "urban version" [...] shows Williams walking in a park and through streets. There are a few clips that they both share <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> but for <b>the</b> 3-minute and 31-second video, they give the song a different feel.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{for a limited}} run in April, 2008 at <b>the</b> Paragon Cineplex <b>in</b> Bangkok, Thailand in its censored form. <b>In</b> protest of <b>the</b> censoring, the director inserted black, scratched film trailer in place {{of each of the}} censored scenes, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> length as <b>the</b> scenes that were cut. The result is that the audience experiences no sound and no picture for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film as the censored scenes.|$|R
50|$|On {{permanent}} {{display is}} also the old inspection room or Staalmeesterskamer where cloth was inspected and the meeting hall where disputes were decided. Four large paintings depicting the cloth industry by Isaac van Swanenburg hang <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> on <b>the</b> walls as designed. Similarly, a very grand over-the-mantel piece by Carel de Moor shows <b>the</b> inspectors <b>in</b> a massive wooden frame decorated with their family shields, flanked {{by a series of}} three historical allegories of the city of Leiden by Abraham Lambertsz van den Tempel.|$|R
5|$|The park {{district}} {{does not}} appear to have moved the carousel after taking over in 1945, as a 1955 newspaper article noted it was still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> it had occupied for 38years. The carousel was again operated as a concession within the park, this time by the wife of Everett DuBois, the park superintendent. Like Hubbs, Mrs. DuBois operated the carousel for almost 10years. Although the district did not change the ride's location, it noted in 1955 that the equipment was showing its age. In 1955 the park district attempted to paint over the oil paintings on the canopy, which had deteriorated. The Indianapolis Art League objected, and volunteered to restore the original paintings rather than have them painted over with Disney characters.|$|E
5|$|During the afternoon's {{practice}} session on Friday, June 17, 2005, Ralf Schumacher, driving for Toyota, crashed badly in Turn 13 of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course, apparently {{as a result}} of a left-rear tyre failure. He was unable to continue racing, and was replaced by the team's test driver, Ricardo Zonta, for the rest of the weekend. Schumacher had crashed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> {{as a result of}} a tyre failure the previous year, while driving for the Williams team. Turn 13 on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course is a high speed banked turn, unique in Formula One racing, which causes a greater than usual tyre loading. On June 18, Michelin reported that it did not understand why the tyres it had provided for its seven customer teams– BAR, McLaren, Red Bull, Renault, Sauber, Toyota, and Williams– had failed in this turn, and announced its intention to fly in tyres of a different specification from its Clermont-Ferrand headquarters. Unfortunately, the replacement tyres flown in, which were of the type used in the Spanish Grand Prix earlier that year, turned out to have the same problem when tested.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend to stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E

25|$|The Church of Nuestra Señora de la Merced (Our Lady of Mercy) was consecrated in 1864 and it {{was built}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> where the old Merlo’s chapel stood.

5000|$|For the July 2009 World Cup race (left), {{there were}} 14 {{downstream}} gates and 6 upstream gates. Most of the racers backed through downstream gates #3 and #16 {{in order to}} set up for upstream gates #4 and #17. [...] For the 2012 race, there were 25 gates for the semi-finals and finals. For the heats, with only 18 gates, the six upstream gates were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> but with lower numbers: 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, & 18. In two places, a barrier was added connecting an island to the right bank and sending all flow around {{the left side of}} the island.|$|R

5000|$|The {{multiplayer}} {{component of}} the game consists of many online game types. These consist of deathmatch, team deathmatch, and [...] "Capture the Flag" [...] modes. There is also an [...] "Invasion" [...] (co-op survival) mode, in which players are trapped in a small map where they must survive for a chosen amount of time. <b>In</b> this mode, <b>the</b> weapons and ammunition regenerate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spots</b> each time, allowing the players to dodge the burden of ammunition shortages. Players can pick up melee weapons from recently killed melee weapon wielding zombies as well. In some variants of Invasion maps, players who die or are bitten by zombies become zombies themselves, and try to kill their former teammates.|$|R
25|$|The Eastern Branch Bridge Co. {{sued the}} U.S. Navy for burning its bridge. To quiet the suit, Congress {{appropriated}} $20,000 (another source says $20,500) {{to pay the}} bridge's investors. The bridge company used some of this money to rebuild, and a wooden bascule span bridge reopened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> in 1815. Now often called the Pennsylvania Avenue Bridge, it operated as a toll bridge from 1815 to 1841. It deteriorated over time, and in 1841 was closed to vehicular traffic (but remained open for foot traffic).|$|E

The Imperial defenders of Wolgast, in charge since the battle of 1628, were defeated on 7 August 1630 in the town, and on 25 August in the castle of Wolgast. While his success was longer lasting, {{he would return to}} Wolgast on 15 July 1633 in a casket, when his body was embarked for the final transfer to Sweden.|$|E
25|$|Nate Davis {{threw for}} a {{touchdown}} and ran for another, and the Cardinals stayed unbeaten by wearing down the Miami RedHawks for a 31–16victory. Ball State improved to 10–0 {{for the first time}} and matched their school record for victories. MiQuale Lewis had two one-yard touchdowns in the second half and finished with 165yards, one short of his career high. He also caught two passes for 51yards. For the third straight game, the Cardinals did not draw a penalty. Despite the victory, The Cardinals dropped three spots to #17in the BCS Poll, but stayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spot</b> in the Associated Press and USA Today coaches poll.|$|E

25|$|Campaign {{scenarios}} are persistent, meaning that all player structures are 'saved' when a game is won. For example, {{if a player}} builds a base and conquers a province, only to have a neighbouring faction attack aforementioned province, the player will start out with his previous base, {{with the exception of}} having no technology researched. Also, the CPU always starts out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>spot,</b> rather than being random. If you build a defense around the CPU's starting point and it's too close, it will be removed {{at the beginning of the}} defense match. Players may also choose to garrison provinces with units that are instantly available should the province be attacked. These are bought with planetary requisition.|$|E
