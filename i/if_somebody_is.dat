500|$|A {{recurring}} {{source of}} lyrical subject matter in Let the Blind Lead is Cox's best friend, Deerhunter guitarist Lockett Pundt, whom {{the album is}} dedicated to. [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] concerns {{the first time the}} two met. Seeing him at a bus stop while vacationing in Savannah, Georgia, Cox was [...] "attracted to him, but not in some kind of like, just physical way." [...] Seeing [...] "his melancholy, his sitting alone, staring at the ground", he [...] "fell in love" [...] with him. Cox and his family later drove to a beach; [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] relates to Cox’s memory of the beach, being [...] "infected with that new love" [...] found after meeting Pundt. The words of [...] "Scraping Past" [...] are about [...] "moving on…And wondering <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> going to come with you or…stay behind." [...] This uncertainty is characterized by several lines Cox considers [...] "pop song clichés", referencing [...] "rain that comes and goes." [...] In the song, Cox asks Pundt, [...] "Are you going to come with me, or are you staying here?" [...] In [...] "Ativan" [...] Cox examines his addiction to the drug of the same name, as well as his relationship with Pundt. [...] "It talks a lot about how things have changed between me and Lockett's relationship and how he's met a girl and…our friendship is never gonna change, but it's difficult sometimes." [...] Cox asserts that he would [...] "rather just take whatever drugs it takes to go to sleep and sleep through it…I'm not prepared to face it yet." ...|$|E

And {{she turned her back}} on them, and would not even eat the food they had brought. So they went away, and the young man soon stretched himself out on his mat; but his wife's odd conduct made him anxious, and he lay wake all night, listening.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's very curious," [...] muttered Buster, [...] "very curious indeed. It {{looks as}} if my fishing is spoiled for to-day. I don't {{understand}} it at all. It's lucky I caught what I did. It looks as <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> trying to--ha!" [...] A sudden thought had popped into his head. Then he began to chuckle and finally to laugh. [...] "I do believe that scamp Joe Otter {{is trying to get}} even with me for eating that fat trout!" ...|$|E
60|$|And, when Grandfather's meditations {{had grown}} very {{profound}} indeed, he fancied {{that he heard}} a sound over his head, as <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>were</b> preparing to speak.|$|R

For example, <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> angry, he {{must not only}} not get angry, but also become meek; <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> proud, he must not only refrain from being proud but also become humble. Thus, every passion has an opposing virtue: pride — humility, stinginess — charity, lust — chastity, faintheartedness — patience, anger — meekness, hatred — love.|$|R
60|$|It {{would be}} folly to {{entertain}} any ill-feeling towards those neighbours and rivals who, like ourselves, are slaves of Istar; but <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> to be starved, {{the modern world}} has no Oracle of Delphi to which the nations can appeal for {{an indication of the}} victim. It is open to us to try our fortune; and, if we avoid impending fate, there will be a certain ground for believing: that we are the right people to escape. Securus judical orbis.|$|E

50|$|When {{fresh water}} is {{unavailable}} (e.g. at sea or in a desert), seawater and ethanol will worsen the condition. Urine contains a similar solute concentration to seawater, and numerous guides advise against its consumption in survival situations. <b>If</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> dehydrated and {{is taken to}} a hospital, IVs are also used.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} {{there was a}} noise outside the front door, a sort of scrabbling noise, as <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>were</b> trying to paw {{his way through the}} woodwork. Then a sort of thud.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} or two Foster heard nothing, {{and then there was a}} splash and a noise, as <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> floundering through the rushes. The sounds were nearer than he had thought possible, and he glanced at his companion.|$|R
60|$|Birkin, as he drove, felt a {{creeping}} of the spine, as <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> threatening his neck. But {{he shrugged}} with indifference. It began to rain. Here was a change. He {{stopped the car}} and got down {{to put up the}} hood.|$|R
5000|$|So <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> {{watching}} {{tonight and}} listening to what {{the two of you}} just said, is it fair to say, okay, the differences between Governor Bush and Vice President Gore are as follows. You're for doing something on the consumption end and you're for doing something on the production end? How would you draw the difference? ...|$|E
5000|$|... full of {{inaccuracies}} and {{the selection}} leaves {{much to be}} desired. Between one third {{and a half of}} the dates are wrong because Giles supposed that <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> recorded as having died in 1200 aged 63 he or she must have been born in 1137 (in most cases 1138 would have been a better guess).|$|E
5000|$|Lying: It {{is hard to}} tell <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> lying at {{the time}} they do it, {{although}} often the truth may be apparent later when it is too late. One way to minimize the chances of being lied to is to understand that some personality types (particularly psychopaths) are experts at the art of lying and cheating, doing it frequently, and often in subtle ways.|$|E
60|$|From {{the other}} side of the door {{proceeded}} a sound like water gurgling from a bottle, mingled with cries half suppressed, as <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>were</b> being prevented from uttering them by a hand laid over his mouth. The sufferer appeared to have a high voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Looks {{to me as}} <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} get into a fight," [...] {{returned}} Jack. [...] "See! one of those fellows just made a pass at Fred. Come on, this won't do!" [...] and he ran back towards the crowd that was gathering.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, ma'am,' he returned, 'I am {{thinking}} about Tom Gradgrind's whim;' Tom Gradgrind, for a bluff independent {{manner of speaking}} - as <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>were</b> always endeavouring to bribe him with immense sums to say Thomas, and he wouldn't; 'Tom Gradgrind's whim, ma'am, of bringing up the tumbling-girl.' ...|$|R
50|$|On {{the outside}} of the white wall of Kathmandu Durbar, {{opposite}} the Vishnu Temple, is a long low stone inscription to the goddess Kalika written in fifteen different languages, including European languages. Pratap Malla, renowned for his linguistic abilities, set up this inscription on 14 January 1664. A legend tells that milk will flow from the spout in the middle <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> able to decipher all fifteen languages.|$|E
5000|$|For mobile phones, in German the pseudo-anglicism Handy is used, <b>If</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> sneezing, one {{may respond}} [...] "god bless you". Because many people don't {{want to use}} a blessing phrase with {{religious}} context, instead the German term [...] "gesundheit" [...] is widely used. In German, Gesundheit means health, but is also used as response when someone sneezes. The same word in used in Yiddish, and thus came to be known also in the US.|$|E
5000|$|Peter Robinson {{said that}} he would contest the {{allegations}} that he failed to properly report these transactions. He claimed to have no knowledge of them [...] "I had no information," [...] he said. [...] "Absolutely no information about that, nor of any of the other financial arrangements, which is hardly surprising - <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> hiding an affair from you, it’s probably not a surprise they are hiding the other arrangements relating to that affair." ...|$|E
60|$|A blue gauze {{of smoke}} floated over the chimney, as <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> living there; round towards the side some empty hen-coops were piled away; {{while under the}} hollies were divers {{frameworks}} of wire netting and sticks, showing that birds were kept here at some seasons of the year.|$|R
50|$|Arrest {{of speech}} {{is a form}} of anarthria. The child is unable to utter a single intelligible word and {{attempts}} to communicate with gestures. My mouth opened and I could not speak.

60|$|At last he arrived, and Mike, fumbling at a glove, tottered {{out into}} the sunshine. He heard miles and miles away a sound of clapping, and a thin, shrill noise as <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>were</b> {{screaming}} in the distance. As a matter of fact, several members of his form and of the junior day-room at Wain's nearly burst themselves at that moment.|$|R
5000|$|Director Matt Campea {{described}} {{in an interview}} what drew him to this topic for a documentary, “They have this secret that festers inside them that they can’t talk to anyone about. That’s a dark place.” He continued, “We’re at {{a moment in time}} here. <b>If</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> born with something they can’t control, we shouldn’t condemn them. We should extend a compassionate hand and give them the resources they need to lead a virtuous, dignified life.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The Buddhist logician Dharmakirti critiqued anekāntavāda as follows: With the {{differentiation}} removed, all things have dual nature. Then, <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> implored to eat curd, then {{why he does}} not eat camel?" [...] The insinuation is obvious; if curd exists from the nature of curd and does not exist from {{the nature of a}} camel, then one is justified in eating camel, as by eating camel, he is merely eating the negation of curd.

5000|$|... "I am a preacher. I {{know that}} the spirit of {{witchcraft}} is against the Almighty God. <b>If</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> a liar, he is bewitching God. I don't condone lie. Dr. King does not condone sin. I flog a lot. I have canes. If husband and wife mess up by having misunderstanding, I have to settle them. But the person that is at fault, I must flog. If the person refuses to be flogged, I will send him out of the church." ...|$|E
2500|$|And, I {{know the}} sense of {{helplessness}} that people feel. I know the urge to arm yourself, because that's what I did. I was trained in firearms. I'd walk to the hospital when my husband was sick. I carried a concealed weapon. I made the determination that <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> {{going to try to}} take me out, I was going to take them with me.|$|R
5000|$|The {{series is}} set in Istanbul and {{features}} an unnamed transvestite amateur sleuth and Somer explains the title; [...] "Hop-Çiki-Yaya was a cheerleading chant from Turkish colleges in the early 1960s, and {{it came to be}} used in comedy shows to mean gays. <b>If</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> queenish, then they'd say 'Oh, he's Hop-Çiki-Yaya'. By the 70s, it wasn't being used anymore - so I brought it back." ...|$|R

5000|$|When Jordan asked [...] "Okay, {{without being}} too gory or graphic, so <b>if</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> homosexual, you {{would argue that}} they should not have sex?" [...] Santorum stated: In every society, the {{definition}} of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing. And when you destroy that you have a dramatic impact on the quality.|$|E
5000|$|The Supreme {{court of}} India on November 28, 2016 gave some {{positive}} indications {{that it may}} allow Vedanta University. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of India {{and a member of}} the bench hearing this case, Justice T.S. Thakur, is quoted to have said [...] "Why should anyone oppose setting up of a world class university which will give opportunity to over one lakh students? <b>If</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> making an investment of Rs 2,500 crore in education, why should somebody oppose it? Students will benefit. Public would benefit." ...|$|E

Antonín reveals his name and she says that he has to stop watching her.|$|R
