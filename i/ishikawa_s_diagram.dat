40|$|This {{research}} advances ABM as {{a generic}} analysis tool such that ABM can reach its full {{potential as a}} revolution in modeling and simulation. To achieve this goal, the field of ABM is examined from many perspectives. The first perspectives examined are complex systems, the historical emergence of ABM, and philosophical issues related to ABM. These topics establish some clear foundations for the field across multiple disciplines. Next the current practice of ABM is investigated. Through a comprehensive 279 article survey some current deficiencies and opportunities in ABM are identified. Based on these opportunities, a new diagramming technique called the Conceptual Model for Simulation (CM 4 <b>S)</b> <b>Diagram</b> is developed. Fundamentally, the CM 4 <b>S</b> <b>Diagram</b> represents the first diagramming technique designed specifically for the effective representation, construction, and sanctioning of ABM computer simulations based on identified needs in the ABM modeling field and simulation modeling philosophy.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the deepest hard X-ray survey to date of about 2500 deg 2 performed by the IBIS instrument on board INTEGRAL in the 20 - 60 keV band, with a total exposure time of 4 Ms. We find 34 candidate sources, for which we try to find counterparts at other wavelengths. The ratio of Seyfert 1 to Seyfert 2 is significantly more than the ratio found in the optical. This effect may be explained in the framework of the receding-torus model, but could also be due to absorption columns large enough to affect the 20 - 60 keV band. None of the predicted Compton-thick objects with 1024 < < 1025 cm- 2 is detected unambiguously; when taking lower limits on into account, the fraction of these objects is found to be lower than 24 %. We do not see, but cannot exclude, a relationship between absorption and luminosity similar to what is seen in the 2 - 10 keV band. Our data suggests the possibility of a lack of objects with 1021 1022 cm- 2, which could be expected if absorption has two origins, for instance a torus-like structure and the host galaxy. We find that the Log N-Log <b>S</b> <b>diagram</b> of our sources is compatible with those obtained in other surveys in hard X-rays. Compared to models of the AGN population selected in the 2 - 10 keV band, the Log N-Log <b>S</b> <b>diagram</b> is generally in good agreement, but the distribution is significantly different, with significantly less unabsorbed sources (< 1022 cm- 2) at a given flux limit compared to the models. In this survey, we resolve about 2. 5 % of the cosmic X-ray background in the 20 - 60 keV band. We also study the local hard X-ray luminosity function, which is compatible with what is found in other recent hard X-ray surveys. The characteristic luminosity Log is found to be a factor about 5 lower than the value observed in the 2 - 10 keV band.

40|$|This paper investigates why the {{observed}} critical Shields stress for incipient sediment motion deviates from the Shields curve. This deviation {{is often described}} in the literature as due to measurement errors and non-uniformity of channel-bed slope or flows.

We found that the existence of vertical velocity in non-uniform flows can lead to the deviation of critical shear stress from the standard Shield 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>diagram</b> that is valid only in uniform flows, and the channel bed slope could not contribute to the flow 2 ̆ 7 s non-uniformity. The new hypothesis was successfully tested with the experimental data available in the literature. In addition, a new theory for critical shear stress has been developed, which shows that the decelerating flows promote the mobility of sediment, but accelerating flows constrain its mobility. A unified critical Shields stress for sediment transport has been established, that can predict the critical shear stress for sediment initial motion in both uniform and non-uniform flows...|$|R

Two dozen {{long period}} pulsars are {{separated}} from the swarm of ordinary pulsars by an obvious gap in the P versus <b>Sd</b> <b>diagram</b> (where <b>Sd</b> = log ˙P + 21. 0), with a plausible upper boundary for ordinary pulsars. Possible pulsar evolutionary tracks are discussed to explain the diagram in terms of previously suggested scenarios of magnetic field decay. The (P –Sd) diagram is difficult to understand {{if there is no}} magnetic field decay during the active life of pulsars. However, if the magnetic fields of neutron stars decay exponentially, almost all slowly rotating pulsars must have been injected with a very long initial spin period of about 2 seconds, which seems impossible. Based on qualitative analyses, it is concluded that magnetic fields of neutron stars decay as a power-law, with a time scale related to the initial field strengths. The plausible boundary and the gap are suggested to naturally divide pulsars with distinct magnetic “genes”, ie. pulsars which were born from strongly magnetized progenitors — such as Bp stars, and pulsars born from normal massive stars. The possibility remains open that a fraction of slowly rotating pulsars were injected with long initial spin periods, while others would have a classical pulsar evolution history. It is suggested that PSR B 1849 + 00 was born in the supernova remnant Kes- 79 with an initial period of about 2 seconds...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the 1 s X-ray emission and high-energy-resolution fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption spectroscopies (XES and HERFD-XAS) to resolve the variations in the chemical state (electronic structure and local coordination) of Br has been investigated for a selected set of compounds including NaBrO 3, NH 4 Br and C 2 H 4 Br 2 (1, 2 -dibromoethane). For the Br K-edge XAS, employing the HERFD mode significantly increases the energy resolution, which demonstrates that with a crystal spectrometer used as a detector the absorption technique becomes a more powerful analytical tool. In the case of XES, the experimental results {{as well as the}} density functional theory (DFT) modeling both show that the chemical {{sensitivity of}} the main 1 <b>s</b> <b>diagram</b> emission lines (Ka 1, 2 and Kb 1, 3) is rather limited.

The spectra are in good agreement with the molecular orbital description delivered by DFT calculations. Calculations for an extended series of Br compounds confirm that valence-to-core XES can serve as a probe for chemical analysis, and, being a hard X-ray photon-in/photon-out technique, it is particularly well-suited for in situ investigations of molecular transformations, even on the ultrafast time scales down to femtosecond time resolution...|$|R

Five years previously, preparation for creation of the ICPM-AC was started at the 4 th World Congress of the International College of Psychosomatic Medicine (ICPM) held in Kyoto, Japan, September 5 - 9, 1977. The First Congress of the ICPM-AC was held by the President Yujiro IKEMI in Tokyo on May 19 - 20, 1984. The main members in the early stage were Y.

Thereafter, academic congresses of the ICPM-AC, the 2 nd to the 9 th, were held approximately every two years, in Japan, India, Malaysia, Taiwan, Korea, and China. The name was changed to the Asian College of Psychosomatic Medicine (ACPM), and the 10 th to 14 th congresses were held in Taiwan, Okinawa (Japan), Australia, Korea, and China. The current president of the Executive Board of ACPM is Chiharu KUBO, the Director of Kyushu University Hospital. The next academic congress is the 15 th ACPM and will be hosted by Tserenkhuugyin LKHAGVASUREN in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia from August 24 - 26, 2012. Participating countries have expanded to include Asian-Oceanic countries such as Mongolia, Micronesia, Australia and Sri Lanka.
