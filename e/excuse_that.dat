5|$|After Whitlam left, Kerr {{called in}} Fraser, {{informed}} {{him of the}} dismissal, {{and asked if he}} would form a caretaker government, to which Fraser agreed. Fraser later stated that his overwhelming sensation at the news was relief. Fraser left to return to Parliament House, where he conferred with Coalition leaders, while Kerr joined the luncheon party that had been waiting for him, apologising to his guests and offering the <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> he had been busy dismissing the Government.|$|E
5|$|Lucilla's guardian, Oliver Carleton, visits Bath to {{investigate}} her new living arrangements. Carleton is a rake– a sexually experienced man {{who refuses to}} conform to many of society's guidelines. His biting wit has earned him the label of rudest man in England, but he and Annis soon find mutual enjoyment in lively banter. As Carleton and Annis's friendship develops, they discover deeper feelings for each other. Carleton proposes marriage, but Annis refuses, unwilling to relinquish her independence. Using the <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> he must find Lucilla a new guardian, Carleton returns to London.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{also sent}} diplomats to other Italian states. In August 1451, along with Venice he sent {{messages}} to Francesco Sforza, then duke of Milan, and Siena to inform them of his {{victory over the}} Turks and of the desperate need for supplies to continue combating the Ottoman armies, but no aid was received. Venice responded that she wished to see the Albanians and the Turks settle for peace, whereas Sforza's response hinged upon the <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> his state was not financially sound and that his soldiers were not meant to help an Albanian prince. Only Ragusa offered {{a large amount of}} ducats.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no {{notion of}} extenuating ill-conduct or making <b>excuses!</b> <b>That's</b> the modern way! So {{principles}} get lowered! I tell you, sir, there are excuses for everything. What {{makes the difference}} is only the listening to them or not." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{tried to}} find work, but without success. Even in places where help was wanted excuses were made to me-- trivial <b>excuses</b> <b>that</b> meant but one thing-- {{that they did not}} desire any one in their employ who had a stain upon his name.|$|R
50|$|Ryan: Failed {{to show up}} to {{challenge}} and failed to give any reason why. In the boardroom he gave <b>excuses</b> <b>that</b> nobody, including Kevin, believed. In the end Ryan {{was forced to leave}} with his exit package, he was not given the opportunity to turn it down and remain in the game.|$|R
5|$|The College found a patroness in Mary I, {{although}} {{it must have}} been embarrassing for both sides, after the heralds initially proclaimed the right of her rival Lady Jane Grey to the throne. When King Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed queen four days later, first in Cheapside then in Fleet Street by two heralds, trumpets blowing before them. However, when popular support swung to Mary's side, the Lord Mayor of London and his councils accompanied by the Garter King of Arms, two other heralds, and four trumpeters returned to Cheapside to proclaim Mary's ascension as rightful queen instead. The College's excuse was that they were compelled in their earlier act by the Duke of Northumberland (Lady Jane's father-in-law, who was later executed), an <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> Mary accepted.|$|E
5|$|The same day, Mary Margaret (Goodwin) rushes out {{the door}} and gives Emma an <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> she has to make a volcano. In truth she has been going to Granny's at 7:15 every morning to see David (Dallas) getting coffee for himself and Kathryn (Griffith). Emma, who can always spot a lie, follows Mary Margaret to call out her {{stalking}} behavior and suggests she stop seeing him. Mary Margaret buys some chocolate to drown her woes and runs right into Kathryn, who is picking up a pregnancy test. Regina notices this, and warns Mary Margaret to stay away from David, and it was their personal life.|$|E
5|$|Additional SS {{trials and}} {{convictions}} followed. Many defendants attempted to exculpate themselves using the <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> they were merely following superior orders, {{which they had}} to obey unconditionally {{as part of their}} sworn oath and duty. The courts did not find this to be a legitimate defense. A trial of 40 SS officers and guards from Auschwitz took place in Kraków in November 1947. Most were found guilty, and 23 received the death penalty. In addition to those tried by the Western allies, an estimated 37,000 members of the SS were tried and convicted in Soviet courts. Sentences included hangings and long terms of hard labor. Piotr Cywiński, the director of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum, estimates that of the 70,000 members of the SS involved in crimes in concentration camps, only about 1,650 to 1,700 were tried after the war. The International Military Tribunal declared the SS a criminal organization in 1946.|$|E
5000|$|Tavis Ormandy {{initially}} {{stated that}} he was [...] "really impressed with Cloudflare's quick response, and how dedicated they are to cleaning up from this unfortunate issue." [...] However, when Ormandy pressed Cloudflare for additional information, [...] "They gave several <b>excuses</b> <b>that</b> didn't make sense," [...] before sending a draft that [...] "severely downplays the risk to customers." ...|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{categories}} of affirmative defenses: justification and excuse. Justifications differ from <b>excuses</b> in <b>that</b> a successful justification will show the defendant's conduct was not wrong, whereas a successful excuse does not show the defendant's conduct was wrong. A successful <b>excuse</b> shows <b>that,</b> while the defendant's conduct was regrettable, this particular defendant will {{not be subject to}} punishment.|$|R
2500|$|Cao Cao ordered Hua Tuo {{to be his}} {{personal}} physician – a job Hua Tuo resented. [...] In order to avoid treating Cao Cao, Hua Tuo repeatedly made <b>excuses</b> <b>that</b> his wife was ill, but Cao Cao discovered the deception and ordered Hua Tuo's execution. Xun Yu, one of Cao Cao's advisers, pleaded for mercy {{on behalf of the}} physician.|$|R
5|$|Symbolism is used {{heavily in}} Blue Velvet. The most {{consistent}} symbolism {{in the film}} is an insect motif introduced {{at the end of}} the first scene, when the camera zooms in on a well-kept suburban lawn until it unearths a swarming underground nest of disgusting bugs. This is generally recognized as a metaphor for the seedy underworld that Jeffrey will soon discover under the surface of his own suburban, Reaganesque paradise. The severed ear he finds is being overrun by black ants. The bug motif is recurrent throughout the film, most notably in the bug-like gas mask that Frank wears, but also the <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> Jeffrey uses to gain access to Dorothy's apartment: he claims to be an insect exterminator. One of Frank's sinister accomplices is also consistently identified through the yellow jacket he wears, possibly reminiscent of the name of a type of wasp. Finally, a robin eating a bug on a fence becomes a topic of discussion in the last scene of the film. The robin, mentioned earlier by Sandy when she recounted her dream, represents love conquering evil.|$|E
25|$|Local Chinese {{were killed}} in some areas, and their {{properties}} looted and burned {{as a result of}} anti-Chinese racism on the <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> D.N. Aidit had brought the PKI closer to China. In the predominantly Christian islands of Nusa Tenggara, Christian clergy and teachers suffered at the hands of Muslim youth.|$|E
25|$|After the Poles' {{resistance}} to pressure, on August 21, Voroshilov proposed adjournment {{of the military}} talks with the British and French, using the <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> {{the absence of the}} senior Soviet personnel at the talks interfered with the autumn manoeuvres of the Soviet forces though the primary reason was the progress being made in the Soviet-German negotiations.|$|E

25|$|Gage hired spies to {{intercept}} Rogers' mail and suborned his subordinates. Unfortunately, Rogers offended his private secretary Nathaniel Potter, and Potter gave Gage the <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> he needed. Potter swore in an affidavit that Rogers {{said that he}} would offer his province to the French if the British government failed to approve his plan of governance.|$|E
25|$|Some time later, Idas and Lynceus visited their uncle's home in Sparta. The {{uncle was}} on his way to Crete, so he left Helen in charge of {{entertaining}} the guests, which included both sets of cousins, as well as Paris, prince of Troy. Castor and Pollux recognized the opportunity to exact revenge, made an <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> justified leaving the feast, and set out to steal their cousins' herd. Idas and Lynceus eventually set out for home, leaving Helen alone with Paris, who then kidnapped her. Thus, the four cousins helped set into motion the events that gave rise to the Trojan War.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} {{her studies}} at the University of Leipzig, Merkel sought an {{assistant}} professorship at an engineering school. As a condition for getting the job, Merkel was told she would need to agree to report on her colleagues to the Stasi, the GDR's secret police. Merkel declined, using the <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> she could not keep secrets well enough to be an effective spy. Merkel worked and studied at the Central Institute for Physical Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin-Adlershof from 1978 to 1990. After being awarded a doctorate (Dr. rer. nat.) for her thesis on quantum chemistry in 1986, she worked as a researcher and published several papers.|$|E
5000|$|Later, Kolchak is {{summoned to}} Petrograd by Alexander Kerensky (Viktor Verzhbitsky), who offers to appoint him Minister of Defence. Kolchak, however, sharply criticises Kerensky for {{promoting}} indiscipline {{in both the}} Russian Army and Navy. He states {{that the only way}} he will accept is if he is given a free hand to restore old practices. Kerensky, enraged by Kolchak's [...] "counterrevolutionary sympathies," [...] exiles him to the United States, <b>excusing</b> <b>that</b> [...] "the allies needs more experts".|$|R
60|$|Hugh {{explained}} (with {{the necessary}} <b>excuses)</b> <b>that</b> his object {{was to say}} a few words to Lord Harry in private. The change visible in the doctor's manner, when he had been made acquainted with this circumstance, was not amiably expressed; he had the air of a man who suspected that an unfair advantage had been taken of him. Lord Harry, on his side, appeared to feel some hesitation in granting a private interview to Mr. Mountjoy.|$|R
60|$|I had {{no reason}} to insinuate what I did. My only <b>excuse</b> is <b>that</b> my nerves must be unstrung--which is no excuse at all.|$|R
25|$|On April 16—one {{day after}} the Braintree robbery-murders—the Federal Immigration Service (FIS) called Chief Stewart to discuss Galleanist and anarchist Coacci, whom Stewart had arrested on their behalf two years earlier. Coacci was slated for {{deportation}} on April 15, 1920, {{the day of the}} Braintree holdup, but telephoned with the <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> his wife was ill. The FIS asked Stewart to investigate Coacci's excuse for failing to report for deportation on April 15. On April 16, officers discovered Coacci at home and determined that he had given a false alibi for not showing up for deportation. They offered him another week, but Coacci declined and left for Italy on April 18, 1920.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} the second serial, The Daleks, that the {{programme}} caught the imaginations of viewers and began to ingrain itself in the popular consciousness. This was primarily due to the Dalek creatures introduced in this story. Devised by scriptwriter Terry Nation and designer Raymond Cusick, they were completely un-humanoid and like nothing that had been seen on television before. Lambert had in fact been strongly advised against using Nation's script by her direct superior Donald Wilson, but used the <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> they had nothing else ready in order to produce it. Once it was clear what a great success it had been, Wilson admitted to Lambert that he would no longer interfere with her decisions as she clearly knew the programme better than he did.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 1948, {{the line}} was nationalised along with its parent company, {{becoming}} part of British Railways (BR). While the GWR had tolerated the Corris, BR was looking for an excuse to close the loss making railway. In August 1948, that excuse came when the Afon Dyfi flooded. The waters began to undermine the Corris Railway embankment {{on the south side}} of the Dyfi Bridge, and although the track was never breached, it was the <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> BR needed to close the line. The last train ran on 20 August 1948 and the following day the railway was closed, without notice. The Aberllefenni to Corris section was lifted in November 1948, and 10 tons of the rail was purchased by Henry Haydn Jones for use on his Talyllyn Railway. By the end of 1950, track lifting had reached Machynlleth station.|$|E

50|$|In March 2009, Kellys {{bitterness}} towards Becky resurfaces {{when they}} get into a blazing row in The Rovers Return. Ignoring Beckys <b>excuses</b> <b>that</b> she is under pressure to serve her, due to {{a large group of}} music fans wanting food, Kelly goes behind the bar and starts helping herself. Becky is furious and throws her out of the pub just as landlady Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) arrives back from lunch. Liz, to Beckys outrage, apologises to Kelly and offers her free drinks.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{the more}} action-packed and felony-oriented show COPS, this show {{consists}} of clips of individuals being pulled over for minor offenses, most commonly speeding, {{as well as}} other things such as seat belt and other equipment violations, and is more comedy-oriented. The entertainment is derived from the interaction between the offender and the police officers. More specifically, the <b>excuses</b> <b>that</b> offenders give for why they allegedly committed the violation. To wrap up most episodes, a [...] "Classic Clip" [...] is shown.|$|R
25|$|By {{the third}} day of his capture, Bryson had earned {{sufficient}} trust from Berdella to persuade him to establish a regime of tying his hands in front of him after his sexual abuse rather than above his head and to the bed upon the <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> his (Berdella's) doing so was restricting the circulation to his arms; he had also persuaded Berdella to leave a television on within the room, with the remote control placed between his legs whenever Berdella was out of the room. However, he would later state to investigators that he had thought almost constantly about escaping. The following day, he managed to break free of his restraints by burning through them using a book of matches Berdella had inadvertently left in the room and within his reach when he had left the house to go to his place of work.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to keep control {{of the process and}} prevent the Assembly from convening, Louis XVI ordered the closure of the Salle des États where the Assembly met, making an <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> the {{carpenters}} needed to prepare the hall for a royal speech in two days. Weather did not allow an outdoor meeting, and fearing an attack ordered by Louis XVI, they met in a tennis court just outside Versailles, where they proceeded to swear the Tennis Court Oath (20 June 1789) under which they agreed not to separate until they had given France a constitution. A majority of the representatives of the clergy soon joined them, as did 47 members of the nobility. By 27 June, the royal party had overtly given in, although the military began to arrive in large numbers around Paris and Versailles. Messages of support for the Assembly poured in from Paris and other French cities.|$|E
25|$|About a year later, Archibald has {{returned}} to Cruden Bay and is preparing a permanent residence there. He buys a trunk from an auctioneer on the street (where he again encounters Gormala) and finds that the trunk contains letters from the late 16th and early 17th centuries. While near the seashore, Archibald notices two ladies stranded on a rock out in the ocean. He helps them get back to shore, and learns {{that one of the}} ladies is an elderly woman named Mrs. Jack, and the other a young, beautiful woman named Marjory, an American who has a strong aversion to Spaniards. Archibald feels himself falling in love with Marjory instantly. Later, Marjory helps Archibald decode the letters that he found in the trunk, which are written in a complicated cipher (Bacon's cipher). Archibald soon proposes marriage to Marjory, but she declines with the <b>excuse</b> <b>that</b> she does not know him well enough.|$|E
