5|$|According to Plutarch, Alcibiades {{had several}} famous teachers, {{including}} Socrates, and was well trained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> Rhetoric.

It {{was believed that}} Socrates took Alcibiades as a student because he believed he could change Alcibiades from his vain ways. Xenophon attempted to clear Socrates' name at trial by relaying information that Alcibiades was always corrupt and that Socrates merely failed in attempting to teach him morality.|$|E

5|$|However, {{during this}} time Inglis' {{relationship}} with his brigade commanders, particularly Brigadier Howard Kippenberger deteriorated. Kippenberger had become highly rated as a field commander {{during the war and}} Inglis may have become resentful. This was uncomfortable for Kippenberger, who had served under Inglis in the Territorial Force and considered him a mentor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> warfare. This was further exacerbated on 30 June when Inglis went to Cairo without informing his staff who, in his absence, subsequently asked Kippenberger to take temporary command of the division. Inglis returned on 1 July having become lost when returning from Cairo.|$|E
5|$|She {{then had}} the idea to weave some of it, so she kept some for herself. Having {{observed}} {{the life of the}} silk worm on the recommendation of her husband, the Yellow Emperor, she began to instruct her entourage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> raising silk worms, sericulture. From this point, the girl became the goddess of silk in Chinese mythology. Silk eventually left China via the heir of a princess who was promised to a prince of Khotan. This probably occurred in the early 1st century CE. The princess, refusing to go without the fabric that she loved, would finally break the imperial ban on silk-worm exportation.|$|E

Andriamahazonoro was among the party of three {{who served as the}} first ambassadors to Britain and Mauritius; he died in 1838 from tangena poison administered in a trial by ordeal during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I.|$|E

5|$|The {{symbolism}} of the garden, particularly of the carvings, {{as well as the}} repetition of sevens and threes, has inspired many interpretations. The engravings upon which the carvings are based were commonplace in Scotland at the time, and were frequently used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> memory, a mnemonic memory technique associated with Freemasonry. The art of memory had become a feature throughout Scottish culture, from the court of Queen Anne, Danish consort of James VI, to the lodges of operative stonemasons. The potential influence of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe's symbolic garden at Uraniborg, which was visited by James IV of Scotland in 1590, has also been noted.|$|E

5|$|America's Asian {{conflicts}} against Japan, North Korea, and North Vietnam brought Sun Tzu to {{the attention}} of American military leaders. The Department of the Army in the United States, through its Command and General Staff College, has directed all units to maintain libraries within their respective headquarters for the continuing education of personnel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> war. The Art of War is mentioned as an example of works to be maintained at each facility, and staff duty officers are obliged to prepare short papers for presentation to other officers on their readings. Similarly, Sun Tzu's Art of War is listed on the Marine Corps Professional Reading Program. During the Gulf War in the 1990s, both Generals Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. and Colin Powell employed principles from Sun Tzu related to deception, speed, and striking one's enemy's weak points. However, the United States and other Western countries have been criticised for not truly understanding Sun Tzu's work and not appreciating The Art of War within the wider context of Chinese society.|$|E

5|$|Atrus {{writes a}} new Age called Releeshahn for the D'ni {{survivors}} {{to rebuild their}} civilization as he and Catherine settle back on Earth, raising a daughter named Yeesha. As Atrus prepares to take the Stranger to Releeshahn, a mysterious man named Saavedro appears and steals the Releeshahn Descriptive Book. The Stranger follows Saavedro through several Ages (which were used to train Sirrus and Achenar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> writing Ages), before finally recovering the book. Ten years later, Atrus asks for the Stranger's help in determining if his sons have repented after their lengthy imprisonment; the Stranger saves Yeesha from Sirrus' machinations, but Sirrus and a repentant Achenar are killed. D'ni is not fully restored until the creatures the D'ni enslaved, known as the Bahro, are freed.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla's {{memory was}} revived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> late {{eighteenth-century}} French painters. His tyrannical career became {{the subject of}} the work of several French painters such as Greuze, , David, Bonvoisin, J.A.C. Pajou, and Lethière. Their fascination with Caracalla was a reflection of the growing discontent of the French people with the French monarchy. Caracalla's visibility was influenced by the existence of several literary sources in French that included both translations of ancient works and contemporary works of the time. Caracalla's likeness was readily available to the painters due to the distinct style of his portraiture and his unusual soldier-like choice of fashion that distinguished him from other emperors. The artworks may have served as a warning that absolute monarchy could become the horror of tyranny and that disaster could come about if the regime failed to reform. Art historian Susan Wood suggests that this reform was for the absolute monarchy to become a constitutional monarchy, as per the original goal of revolution, rather than the republic that it eventually became. Wood also notes the similarity between Caracalla and his crimes leading to his assassination and the eventual uprising against, and death of, King Louis XVI: both rulers had {{died as a result of}} their apparent tyranny.|$|E
5|$|In Aristotle's time, the 4th century BCE, {{porpoises}} {{were regarded}} as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, could already see many physiological and anatomical similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy. His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his “Natural history”. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> this and subsequent periods, porpoises are portrayed with a long snout (typical of dolphins) and a high-arched head. The harbour porpoise {{was one of the}} most accessible species for early cetologists, because it could be seen very close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Much of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises. One of the first anatomical descriptions of the airways of the whales on the basis of a harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray. It nevertheless referred to the porpoise as a fish.|$|E
