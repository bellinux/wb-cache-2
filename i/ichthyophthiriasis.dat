40|$|Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, {{or white}} spot, {{is a well}} known and widely {{distributed}} parasite of freshwater fish. However, it is not know whether it can infect other aquatic vertebrates such as amphibians. This study uses a series of laboratory-based experiments to demonstrate that I. multifiliis can infect the tadpole stage of an amphibian, the striped marshfrog (Limnodynastes peronii) of Eastern Australia. The tadpoles {{did not appear to}} develop <b>ichthyophthiriasis</b> at low parasite levels (200 parasites per tadpole), but at high parasite levels (2, 000 parasites per tadpole) 100 % of the tadpoles developed <b>ichthyophthiriasis.</b> This {{is the first time that}} it has been demonstrated that I. multifiliis can infect a nonpiscine vertebrate host...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Ichthyophthiriasis</b> is a {{worldwide}} fish disease with great financial impact on freshwater fish farming {{due to its}} associated high mortality rates. Current study assesses the parasiticidal capacity of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) against the causative agent, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, in jundiá. Median lethal concentration (LC 50, 96 h) of each chemical agent was established, {{as well as the}} minimum inhibitory concentration of hydrogen peroxide for the parasite´s infectious larval phase (theront). Products were tested asynchronously in parasitized fingerlings for short and long baths at the following concentrations and exposure times: 1. Hydrogen peroxide: (T 1) continuous bath - 30 ppm and (T 2) 50 ppm; (T 3) short bath - 150 ppm, during 1 h and (T 4) 250 ppm during 1 h; control group (without any chemical agent). 2. Chlorine dioxide: (T 1) continuous bath - 4 ppm and (T 2) 20 ppm; (T 3) short bath - 200 ppm, during 1 min; (T 4) short bath - 400 ppm, during 1 min and control group. Data analysis demonstrated a concentration of 82. 54 ppm of the commercial product (or 24. 76 ppm of the active chemical agent) as LC 50, 96 h of H 2 O 2 and 38. 4 ppm product (or 2. 68 ppm of the active chemical agent) for ClO 2. Hydrogen peroxide concentration causing 100 % mortality rate of theronts in 1 h was 25 ppm (product, or 7. 5 ppm of the active chemical agent). At the end of the fourth day of curative experiment, 98 % of the animals died by <b>ichthyophthiriasis.</b> No treatment was effective against the parasite...|$|E
40|$|Protective {{immunity}} of carp to <b>ichthyophthiriasis</b> {{has been}} confirmed, and demonstrated {{for the first}} time in juvenile carp, 10 - 12 weeks old. Standard immunisation procedures were developed here using the theront in preference to cysts. Immunisation included exposure of fish on 3 separate occasions of 14 day intervals to doses of approximately 2, 000 theronts per fish, 80 / cm³. Procedures were controlled so that infections were not allowed to continue beyond the primary stage pH (7. 0 - 7. 2) and temperature (20 ± 2 ° C) were maintained throughout experimental periods. Four weeks after third immunising dose, fish were exposed to a potentially lethal challenge, approximately 8, 000 theronts per fish, 320 /cm³. Following immunisation, fish showed total protection up to 1 month and decreasing protection up to 3 months during which period, mortalities were recorded on challenge. Humoral antibody was monitored at specific stages of experimental infections, peak response 6 - 8 weeks following exposure with detectable levels of antibody persisting for at least 12 weeks. Immunosuppression was demonstrated following intraperitoneal administration of synthetic corticosteroid Triamcinolone acetonide, doses of 200 µg, 100 µg and 10 µg gˉ¹ body weight, and corticosteroid Hydrocortisone 21 -hemisuccinate, doses of 100 µg and 10 µg gˉ¹ body weight, given 14 days after challenge. Immunosuppression was not associated with any significant fall in antibody titre. Studies in cross immunity between Tetrahymena pyriformis (CCAP 1630 /W Claff, 1939 (w)) and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis showed no evidence of the former conferring protection to <b>ichthyophthiriasis.</b> Methods of administration of T. pyriformis to juvenile carp included intraperitoneal injection of freeze dried cilia and whole, live T. pyriformis. The kinetics of the humoral response were measured over 12 weeks, peak antibody titres occurring 6 - 8 weeks following antigen administration. Proliferative responses measured by autoradiography were recorded prior to peak antibody production. Overall results are discussed in relation to immunosuppression, mechanisms of immunity and control and treatment of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Wild-caught rainbowfish Melanotaenia spp. {{originating}} from three isolated populations were infected with a quantified dosage of parasites Ichthyophthirius multifiliis {{in a controlled}} environment. The Melanotaenia eachamensis from Dirran Creek were much more susceptible to <b>ichthyophthiriasis</b> than were M. splendida from the Lake Tinaroo or Bluewater Creek populations. When the highly susceptible Dirran Creek rainbowfish were crossed with rainbowfish from a fourth population, Lake Eacham M. eachamensis, they produced hybrids with significantly higher resistance than pure-bred Dirran Creek, but not higher than pure-bred Lake Eacham fish. Hence, intraspecific hybridization increased resistance to I. multifiliis infection in M. eachamensis. Hosts from all three populations were much less susceptible to infection on their second exposure to the parasite. However, the Bluewater Creek population was better able to acquire immunity to I. multifiliis than either the Dirran Creek or Lake Tinaroo populations. It is tentatively suggested {{that there may be}} a link between the heterozygosity of populations of rainbowfish and their initial ability to resist infection by Ichthyophthirius multifiliis...|$|E
40|$|A {{model system}} was {{developed}} to study Ichthyophthirius multifiliis and the susceptibility of Xiphophorus maculatus to this parasite. The experiments showed that infection levels on X. maculatus can be accurately quantified, thus overcoming existing problems encountered when investigating disease susceptibility using other disease causing organisms. The genetics of susceptibility of X. maculatus to <b>ichthyophthiriasis</b> was evaluated. This initial study, using limited numbers of fish, did not uncover any genetic variation, but did demonstrate the existence of large maternal effects affecting susceptibility. This is discussed. The question of whether more than one strain of I. multifiliis exists was also investigated and results indicate that genetic differences in virulence of different parasite isolates exists. Preservation of the parasite in liquid nitrogen was investigated, as a possible method of maintaining the isolates without genetic change, to enable formation of a parasite gene bank. No ciliate has successfully been preserved in this way. Some success was attained in preserving the encysted stage, when 1. 25 MDMSO {{was used as the}} cryoprotectant.

40|$|Farmed {{fingerlings}} of South American catfish {{are frequently}} exposed to several parasites, but little {{information is available}} for implementing health programs for control and prevention of parasitic diseases in the hatcheries. This study evaluated the parasitic fauna of cachara catfish fingerlings (Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum Eingenmann & Eigenmann, 1889) and the host-parasite relationship {{during the early stages}} of rearing. A total of 302 cachara fingerlings were used for parasitic diagnosis and histopathological analysis. Ichthyophthirius multifiliis and Trichodina heterodentata were diagnosed as the most prevalent parasites, followed by Cryptobia sp., Henneguya sp., Monogenea and Nematoda. There was a positive correlation between the size of the fish and the mean intensity of parasitism by I. multifiliis. Proliferation of mucus cells, club cells, multifocal area of degeneration, epithelial necrosis on the body surface, skin ulceration, fusion of secondary gill lamellae and inflammatory infiltration were observed in I. multifiliis-infected fish. Ciliated protozoans were the main etiological agents diagnosed, and the cachara (P. reticulatum) is a new host for T. heterodentata. In addition, <b>ichthyophthiriasis</b> induced sever...|$|E

In the {{available}} literature, {{there is only a}} few reports on the health status of chub, particularly in the Sava river. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate health status of chub as indicator of water quality. Furthermore we aimed at relating fish histology and parasitology to the number of bacteria in the water. We sampled 289 chubs for parasitological and histological examination. Fish were sampled on five sites from slovenian–croatian border through to the inflow of river Una in Sava. At the same time, water was sampled for the counting of coliforms and heterotrophic bacteria. The difference in the number of bacteria in the water was pronounced at different locations, with Oborovo and Otok Samoborski having the highest and the lowest values respectively. The intensity of histological parameters was in correlation with the number of bacteria in water. At least one histological parameter highly correlating with the water quality was found in every organ. Regarding parasite invasions, only <b>ichthyophthiriasis</b> and trichodiniasis showed high negative correlation with microbiological quality of the water.

40|$|The main {{parasitic}} {{threat to}} freshwater fish is the ciliate Ichthyophthirius multitihis. We developed a real-time PCR assay using SYBR Green (TM) intercalating fluorescent dye for rapid detection and quantification of I. multifiliis. This non-invasive assay {{was based on}} the quantification of L multitihis free-swimming stages from filtered water samples, and thus made it possible to preserve host individuals. An alignment of 18 S rDNA sequences of I. multifiliis and related species of the ciliate order Hymenostomatida was used to design amplification primers specifically targeting the L multifillis 18 S rDNA gene. Different standard curves consisting of 2 -fold serial dilutions of DNA extracted from 20, 60, 100 and 1000 I. multifiliis cells were constructed. The assay was able to detect less than 0. 5 cell equivalent and showed a strong linearity (R- 2 = 0. 984). Water samples were collected from 2 tanks containing heavily infected and apparently uninfected Carassius auratus specimens and were used to test this technique. Positive signals were obtained from water samples collected from both tanks, with a deduced concentration ranging from 3 to 58 L multifiliis cells 1 (- 1). The assay can detect low concentrations of the parasite in water, presumably corresponding to an early phase of the disease. It may, thus, be a valuable tool in assisting in the monitoring and control of <b>ichthyophthiriasis</b> in aquaculture...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Ichthyophthirius multifiliis is an {{important}} fresh-water teleost pathogen that can infect most species of freshwater fish worldwide and often leads to significant economic losses to the aquaculture industry. Potassium ferrate(VI), as a potential therapeutic agent for external protozoan parasite infections, has been proven to kill I. multifiliis theronts effectively; however, no information is available on effects of potassium ferrate(VI) exposure to I. multifiliis tomonts. This study evaluated the effects of potassium ferrate(VI) on the survival and reproduction of I. multifiliis tomonts. The results of experiment 1 showed that potassium ferrate(VI) at concentrations of 2. 4, 4. 8, 9. 6, and 19. 2 mg/L resulted in tomont survival rates of 82. 2 %, 34. 2 %, 14. 6 %, and 0, respectively, and significant differ-ences were noted in tomont reproduction between the treatments and the control (P< 0. 05). Additionally, {{this study was designed}} to determine the effect of potassium ferrate(VI) toxicity on age of the tomont. The results indicated that encysted I. multifiliis was more resistant to potassium ferrate(VI) treatments. In addition, {{this study was designed to}} investigate I. multifiliis tomont survival and reproduction when collected from infested goldfish in potassium ferrate(VI) solutions at different concentrations (0, 2. 4, 4. 8, 9. 6, and 19. 2 mg/L) for 30 min. It was found that the tomont survivals in the treatments were signifi-cantly lower than those in the control (P< 0. 05).

The objective {{of the study was}} to enhance immune system of the fishfry on the <b>ichthyophthiriasis</b> diseases. The vaccine was prepared by prolonged treatment of theron in waterbath of 47 °C for 30 minutes. The vaccine was administrated to fish by immersion in aquaria. A completelyrandomized design (CRD) in factorial pattern (3 X 3 X 3) was carried out with dose and time as factors. Doses of treatment and time of immersion were of 1 ml/L, 2 ml/L and 3 ml/L as well as 15, 30 and 45 minutes of treatment time respectively.

40|$|Currently, in Romanian aquaculture, the rearing of the European catfish into {{intensive}} {{production systems}} raises a growing interest determined by its higher technological performances. In comparison with pond traditional aquaculture, the new farming systems {{are characterized by}} modified environmental conditions that may lead, in case of exceeding thresholds of tolerability, to occurrence of stress factors, thus setting the disease conditions. From this perspective, {{the purpose of this}} paper is to present the association circumstances of the predisposed environmental conditions that have weakened the fish body resistance promoting the pathological action of Ichthyophthirius multifiliis after the transfer of European catfish juveniles (G= 33. 6 ± 1. 7 g, L= 17. 5 ± 2. 9 cm) from a pond system into a tank culture system with partially reused water. During a 21 -day period, some restrictive parameters of water quality have registered values far beyond the optimum interval for wells juveniles growth (t≤ 16 o C, C max N-NH 4 + = 3. 62 mg/l, C max NO 2 - = 9. 18 mg/l, C max Cl 2 = 0. 1 mg/l) which caused the appearance of some characteristic symptoms, such as the gills brown coloration, masking the first symptoms of <b>ichthyophthiriasis</b> and contributing to the subclinical evolution of the disease. The concentrations of water chemical parameters were determined by spectrophotometer methods using Merck kits, analogous to standard methods. Subsequently, the “ich” diagnosis was confirmed by microscopic examination of the gills and skin scrapings highlighting the presence of parasites. In order to alleviate methaemoglobinaemia and parasite treatment, sodium chloride was gradually added in water till 1 ppt concentration.  Maintaining the salinity of the system led to a reduction of gills parasitic intensity, while mature trophonts encapsulated in the skin were protected by mucus hypersecretion. Finally, the destruction of gill epithelium seriously affected the osmoregulation, resulting in fish death by asphyxia which led to a loss of 90 % of the population...|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency}} {{and severity of}} fish diseases is; increasingly, being reported as a limiting factor in the future development of aquaculture. The control of fish disease is largely performed in retrospect through curative chemotherapy. However, the development of resistant strains of fish places the emphasis on preventative, rather than the curative, control of disease. The freshwater parasite Icthyophthirius multifiliis causes the disease known as <b>ichthyophthiriasis</b> or white spot. Losses of fish due to this parasite are believed to total over one million dollars per annum worldwide. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the genetics of resistance to I. multifiliis, Comparisons were made between four stocks of the tropical livebearing fish Xiphophorus maculatus. One of these stocks, the blue platyfish, was found to be less susceptible to white spot than the yellow comet tail, red or red wag tail platyfish, Comparisons with four other tropical spades of fish found significant differences between X. maculatus, X. variatus, Ameca splendens and Ilyodon xanthusi in levels of susceptibility. A. splendens was the most susceptible species, with the blue platy (X. maculatus) and sunset platy (X. variatus) forming the most resistant group. All the remaining stocks and species formed an intermediate group. Examination of resistance to white spot infection in four scale types of related common carp (Cyprinus auratus) also found variation in resistance, with the fully scaled carp being the most resistant phenotype (scattered mirror, linear mirror and leather carp being similar in infection level). More detailed analysis of the genetics of disease resistance was performed with heritability determinations in stocks of A. splendens, X. maculatus (yellow comet tail) and X. maculatus (Vera Cruz). The highest heritability value, based on sire components only, was that for Vera Cruz platyfish of 0. 75, with a value of 0. 23 for X. maculatus (yellow comet tail) and 0. 00 for A. splendens. A breeding programme was also performed between X. maculatus (red platy) and X. variatus (sunset platy) to evaluate the presence of any heterosis. Such was observed, with a heterosis value, based on actual parasite counts, of 16. 2 %. Several factors of the infection process are also discussed, especially the fluctuating yearly trends in infection levels and parasite strain differences. Finally, the future potential of genetic manipulation of fish stocks for increased disease resistance is discussed in the light of this study. It is considered that a useful foundation has been laid for the further development of this approach to disease prevention in aquaculture.
