Initially, authorities around Acapulco gave preference to clean up tourist areas, which resulted in the scenic highway from the hotels to the airport being quickly fixed.

40|$|This paper surveys {{some recent}} {{developments}} {{in the theory of}} capital markets. Particular emphasis is given to two strands of the literature. The first covers some recent and fundamental extensions to the theory of risk aversion and <b>the</b> demand <b>for</b> risky assets. These papers are concerned with the effect of non- hedgeable background risk on risk attitudes. <b>The</b> important implications <b>for</b> finance are <b>for</b> <b>the</b> size of the risk premium (the equity premium puzzle) and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> demand <b>for</b> and <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> contingent claims. For example, background risk may help to explain the apparent over-pricing of options on equity indices. The second topic is interest rate term structure models. Stochastic term structure models try to capture the possible future shapes of the term structure of interest rates. This is relevant <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> contingent claims, in particular <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> interest rate derivatives such as American-style swaptions. The paper will survey the most important recent models in the literature, each of which satisfies the fundamental no-arbitrage property.

She steamed to Spithead in November 1861 with only jury-rigged fore and mizzenmasts. The ship was commissioned in June 1862, {{but was not}} completed until 12 September 1862.

Atlanta was released and sailed for Port-au-Prince three days later. She broke down in Delaware Bay and had to put in at Chester, Pennsylvania for repairs.

5|$|Penelope was {{completed}} at Devonport Dockyard on 27 June 1868 {{for the cost}} of £196,789 and served in the Channel Fleet until June 1869. She was then guard ship at Harwich until 1882, which included summer cruises in company {{with the rest of the}} reserve fleet. She was part of the Particular Service Squadron mobilised during the Russian war scare of June–August 1878. In 1882, she was at Gibraltar on the summer cruise when the Anglo-Egyptian War began and her shallow draught caused her to be sent to Egypt. Upon arrival in Alexandria, she assisted with the evacuation of European refugees for several days before the bombardment of the city began on 11 July. Penelope was the ship closest to the Egyptian forts and fired 231 rounds during the battle. The ship was only lightly damaged by Egyptian shells, with eight men wounded, one eight-inch gun damaged and one mainyard needing to be replaced. She became Rear-Admiral Anthony Hoskins's flagship when the British seized the Suez Canal to allow their troop transports to land at Ismailia. Penelope returned home after the war for a further five years service at Harwich. She was paid off in 1887, refitted, and sent to Simonstown, South Africa, as a receiving ship the following year. In January 1897, Penelope was converted to a prison-hulk and then sold for scrap on 12 July 1912 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> £1,650.
