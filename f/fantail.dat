5|$|Other {{common names}} {{used for this}} species include bluespotted ray, bluespotted <b>fantail</b> ray, bluespotted lagoon ray, bluespotted stingray, <b>fantail</b> ray, lesser <b>fantail</b> ray, lagoon ray, reef ray, ribbon-tailed stingray, and ribbontail stingray. Morphological {{examination}} {{has suggested that the}} bluespotted ribbontail ray is more closely related to the amphi-American Himantura (H. pacifica and H. schmardae) and the river stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) than to the congeneric blotched <b>fantail</b> ray (T. meyeni), which is closer to Dasyatis and Indo-Pacific Himantura.|$|E
5|$|Work {{later in}} the year {{included}} the finishing of the fourth sail, balancing the <b>fantail</b> and sorting out teething troubles with the <b>fantail</b> gearing. The brake and brake lever were made and installed and shutter cranks for the sails were cast.|$|E
5|$|The mill {{is a small}} four storey tower mill with Patent sails and winded by a <b>fantail.</b> It drives {{two pairs}} of millstones, with a third pair driven by an {{auxiliary}} engine.|$|E
50|$|Its {{diagnostic}} physical features: orange-reddish-brown back, rump {{and base}} of tail - easily differentiate it from other <b>fantails.</b> Moreover, {{it can be}} further distinguished from similar <b>fantails</b> as it tends to forage in shady and moist regions of habitats that {{are close to the}} ground.|$|R
50|$|Female <b>fantails</b> {{will also}} {{distract}} a potential predator by {{appearing to be}} injured and luring the predator away from the nest. While the female is pretending to be injured the male may continue to attack the predator. In spite of this <b>fantails</b> have a generally low nesting success.|$|R

5|$|The primary playable {{character}} in Hatoful Boyfriend {{is the human}} protagonist, a boisterous hunter-gatherer {{who lives in a}} cave in the wilderness. Her eight potential love interests in the original version of the game, who together form the rest of the main cast, are Ryouta Kawara, a rock dove and the protagonist's sickly but hardworking childhood friend; Sakuya Le Bel Shirogane, a <b>fantail</b> pigeon and snobbish French aristocrat; Sakuya's older half-brother Yuuya Sakazaki, a popular and flirtatious but strangely secretive <b>fantail</b> pigeon; Nageki Fujishiro, a quiet, bookish mourning dove who never seems to leave the library; San Oko, an athletic, hyperactive <b>fantail</b> pigeon who is obsessed with pudding; Anghel Higure, an eccentric Luzon bleeding-heart who behaves as if he were in some kind of fantasy role-playing game; Kazuaki Nanaki, a kind but narcoleptic button quail and the protagonist's homeroom teacher; and Shuu Iwamine, a creepy, antisocial chukar partridge who serves as the school's doctor. Azami Koshiba, a no-nonsense Java sparrow and takoyaki saleswoman, became a possible love interest in the 2014 remake.|$|E
5|$|In the forests, {{endangered}} birds {{such as the}} yellowhead (mohua) and kakariki (New Zealand parakeet) occur, as {{do other}} birds such as the tui, <b>fantail</b> (piwakawaka), and kererū (New Zealand pigeon). One of New Zealand's only two native species of non-marine mammal, the long-tailed bat, lives in small numbers within the forests, and several species of lizard are also found locally, including the southern forest gecko.|$|E
5|$|John Gould {{and other}} early writers {{referred}} to the species as the black-and-white <b>fantail,</b> although did note the current name. However, willie wagtail rapidly became widely accepted sometime after 1916. Wagtail is derived from its active behaviour, while the origins of willie are obscure. The name had been in use colloquially for the pied subspecies of the white wagtail (Motacilla alba) on the Isle of Man, and Northern Ireland.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bills of}} <b>fantails</b> are typical for aerial insect eating birds, being flat and triangular. The gape is {{surrounded}} by two rows of rictal bristles which are long, often {{as long as the}} bill. The bills of most species are fairly weak, limiting <b>fantails</b> to softer insects, although the more terrestrial willie wagtail has a stronger bill.|$|R
50|$|Good-quality <b>Fantails</b> are {{produced}} by rigorous fry selection.Fantails can be very easy to breed.|$|R
5000|$|This breed {{was first}} {{introduced}} by Charles Darwin. They are similar to Indian <b>fantails,</b> but are pure white and have ribbon-like stripes on their tails. It is difficult to breed outside of Thailand, and few people have done so. A breeder in Pakistan successfully produced striped Thai <b>fantails</b> by pairing black colored males and brown colored females of different breeds.|$|R
5|$|The <b>fantail</b> was made. Some of {{the small}} gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter {{included}} repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft.|$|E
5|$|The Montana {{class would}} have used {{aircraft}} for reconnaissance and for gunnery spotting. The type of aircraft used would have depended on when exactly the battleships would have been commissioned, but in all probability they {{would have used}} either the Kingfisher or the Seahawk. The aircraft would have been floatplanes launched from catapults on the ship's <b>fantail.</b> They would have landed {{on the water and}} taxied to the stern of the ship to be lifted by a crane back to the catapult.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fantail</b> and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The <b>fantail</b> itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|E

5|$|While {{the social}} {{organisation}} of the red-headed myzomela is relatively unknown, {{it is reported}} as being usually solitary or found in pairs, though it {{has been described as}} forming loose associations with brown honeyeaters, and other mangrove-feeding birds such as the northern <b>fantail</b> and yellow white-eye. It is an inquisitive bird and readily responds to pishing, coming close to the caller to investigate the source of the sound and to warn off the intruder. It calls throughout the day when feeding, and males sing from exposed branches in the upper canopy of the food trees.|$|E
5|$|At {{present the}} golden white-eye is very common, {{and in fact}} a 1996 study found that their densities on Saipan were among the highest {{recorded}} for any bird, up to 2,095 birds/km² (8.47 per acre). It was believed that Saipan cannot sustain a larger population of this white-eye than it already does. A 2009 study, which incorporated results from a 2007 survey, found that the species had declined between 1982 and 2007, in common with two other species on Saipan, the rufous <b>fantail</b> and the nightingale reed warbler. All three species are insectivorous and were theorised to have declined due to habitat loss. Nevertheless, the species remained relatively abundant, and the current world population is estimated at around 71,997 birds.|$|E
5|$|When {{the weather}} improved, work {{commenced}} outside. The cap circle was mostly constructed {{before the first}} work-in commenced. The work-ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August, with 35 people participating. During the first work-in, the <b>fantail</b> posts and braces were fitted. The oak cap ribs, which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and the finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting. Intermdiate noggings of oak were fitted and the finial was pulled into position using a windlass. The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and noggings. The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time.|$|E
50|$|The true wagtails {{are part}} of the genus Motacilla in the family Motacillidae and are not close {{relatives}} of the <b>fantails.</b>|$|R
50|$|Its bird {{population}} includes honeyeaters, currawongs, crimson rosellas, thornbills, kookaburras, ravens, grey <b>fantails,</b> eastern whipbirds and white-throated treecreepoers, and even white-breasted sea eagles.|$|R

5|$|During the 1980s these battleships {{made use}} of the RQ-2 Pioneer, an {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle employed in spotting for the guns. Launched from the <b>fantail</b> using a rocket-assist booster that was discarded shortly after takeoff, the Pioneer carried a video camera in a pod under {{the belly of the}} aircraft which transmitted live video to the ship so operators could observe enemy actions or fall of shot during naval gunnery. To land the UAV a large net was deployed {{at the back of the}} ship; the aircraft was flown into it. Missouri and Wisconsin both used the Pioneer UAVs successfully during Operation Desert Storm, and in one particularly memorable incident, a Pioneer UAV operated by Wisconsin received the surrender of Iraqi troops during combat operations. This particular Pioneer was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution, and is now on public display. During Operation Desert Storm these Pioneers were operated by detachments of VC-6. In addition to the Pioneer UAVs, the recommissioned Iowas could support six types of helicopters: the Sikorsky HO3S-1, UH-1 Iroquois, SH-2 Seasprites, CH-46 Sea Knight, CH-53 Sea Stallion and the LAMPS III SH-60B Seahawk.|$|E
5|$|Like other white-eyes, {{the golden}} white-eye is diurnal. In {{contrast}} to the bridled white-eye, which forages in groups and is not territorial, the golden white-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young. The golden white-eye is also territorial, and pairs will sing throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. The golden white-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of {{them in order to}} disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is less aggressive towards them, and in fact the rufous <b>fantail</b> seeks out the golden white-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. The golden white-eye is socially dominant over the bridled white-eyes and rufous fantails, but it is subordinate to the Micronesian myzomela and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely.|$|E
5|$|Pigs {{and goats}} were {{released}} {{on the island}} as potential food in the early 1800s, the goats destroying shrubs and grasses used as nesting sites and the pigs eating eggs and chicks and disturbing the land by nuzzling for food. Several birds have become extinct on the island since the arrival of humans. The first round of extinctions included the Lord Howe swamphen or white gallinule, white-throated pigeon, red-crowned parakeet and the Tasman booby, which were eliminated by visitors and settlers {{during the nineteenth century}} either from overhunting for food or protection of crops. Black rats were released from provisioning whaling ships in the 1840s and mice from Norfolk Island in 1860. In 1918 the black rat was accidentally introduced with the shipwreck of the SS Makambo which ran aground at Ned's Beach. This triggered a second wave of extinctions, including the vinous-tinted thrush, robust white-eye, Lord Howe starling, Lord Howe <b>fantail</b> and the Lord Howe gerygone as well as the destruction of the native phasmid and decimation of palm fruits. Bounties were offered for rat and pig tails and 'ratting' became a popular pursuit. Subsequent poisoning programs have kept populations low. The Lord Howe boobook may have become extinct through predation by, or competition with, the Tasmanian masked owls which were introduced in the 1920s in a failed attempt to control the rat population. Stray dogs are also a threat as they could harm the native wood hen and other birds.|$|E

5|$|The golden white-eye is a generalist, {{feeding on}} fruit, berries, and insects. Nectar forms {{part of the}} diet, and, along with the Micronesian myzomela and the bridled white-eye, the golden white-eye is a {{pollinator}} of some trees, albeit not one as important as these other species. Insects may be either gleaned from the bark of trees and from leaves, or caught in the air. Certain tree species are preferred as foraging habitat. The common forest tree Cynometra ramifolia is the most favoured tree and used more frequently than the equally common Guamia mariannae. There is considerable overlap between this species' foraging range {{and that of the}} bridled white-eye, but the golden white-eye is more generalised in its diet. Within the forest there is some partitioning of niche, with bridled white-eyes (and Micronesian myzomelas) feeding primarily in the forest canopy, and the golden white-eye feeding in both the canopy and understory of the forest, as well as a variety of smaller trees and bushes. It shares the understory with the rufous <b>fantail,</b> which has a different feeding technique. At a smaller scale additional partitioning occurs. The golden white-eye shows differences in the preferred microhabitat for obtaining insects, for example, feeding in dead leaves and branches, whereas the bridled white-eye prefers gleaning insects on live leaves. It is the most generalised of all the extant forest passerines on Saipan. It has been suggested that the versatility in diet and foraging technique is an adaptation to the challenges presented by typhoons, which can dramatically alter the structure of the forest.|$|E
25|$|The rufous <b>fantail</b> is {{also known}} by {{numerous}} other English names {{as well as several}} names in different languages. Some common English names include: rufous-fronted <b>fantail,</b> wood <b>fantail,</b> rufous-fronted flycatcher, wood flycatcher, red <b>fantail,</b> allied flycatcher, rufous flycatcher, rufous fan, red fan or redstart.|$|E
25|$|West Kingsdown Mill is a four-storey smock mill on {{a single}} storey {{single-storey}} brick base. There was a stage at first-floor level. It has two double Patent sails and two Common sails carried on a cast-iron windshaft. The mill is winded by a <b>fantail.</b> The original <b>fantail</b> had seven blades, but this was replaced with a six-bladed one when the mill was restored in 1960. A seven-bladed <b>fantail</b> has since been fitted. All the machinery remains in the mill, except for the final drive to the millstones.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fantails</b> {{frequently}} form {{associations with}} other species in order obtain prey. Some species {{perch on the}} backs of cattle, which they use both as a vantage point and because the cattle flush up insects. This behaviour has given the willie wagtail the nickname [...] "shepherd's companion". <b>Fantails</b> are often very bold around people and will approach them closely in order to capture insects flushed by them. Different species are also frequently found in mixed-species feeding flocks, travelling with other small insectivorous birds {{on the periphery of the}} flocks taking advantage of flushed prey.|$|R
50|$|The {{forest is}} {{inhabited}} by many native bird {{species such as}} kereru, tui, bellbirds, <b>fantails,</b> morepork, and silver-eyes, as well as rarer birds such as grey warblers, tomtits, and the occasional kaka.|$|R
50|$|Ravangla {{attracts a}} lot of Himalayan birds and is a bird watcher's paradise. Birds like verditer flycatchers, blue-fronted redstarts, grey bushchats, dark-throated thrush, blue whistling-thrush, green-backed tit and white-browed <b>fantails</b> can be easily spotted.|$|R
