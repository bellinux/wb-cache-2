5|$|A common {{feature of}} the core syndromes is chorea: {{involuntary}} dance-like movements. In neuroacanthocytosis, this <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> prominent {{in the face and}} mouth which can cause difficulties with speech and eating.

5|$|Although {{meteorological}} surveys alert about hurricanes {{or severe}} storms, {{in the areas}} where the risk of coastal flooding <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> high, there are specific storm surge warnings.

5|$|Basil cultivars are {{cultivated}} {{varieties of}} basil. They {{are used in}} a variety of ways: as culinary herbs, landscape plants, healing herbs, teas, and worship implements. All true basils are species of the genus Ocimum. The genus <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> diverse, and includes annuals, non-woody perennials and shrubs native to Africa and other tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New World. Although it is estimated that there are 50 to 150 species of basil, most, but not all, culinary basils are cultivars of O. basilicum, or sweet basil. Some are cultivars of other basil species, and others are hybrids. It <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> challenging to determine which species a basil belongs to. This is because basil cross-breeds easily, and drawing boundaries between species <b>is</b> <b>particularly</b> difficult. In fact, recent studies have led to reclassification of some portions of the genus.|$|E
