5|$|After {{a period}} of peace, Tantallon again saw {{military}} action during the Bishops' Wars in 1639. The Douglas family <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> Catholic after the Scottish Reformation, incurring {{the wrath of the}} Presbyterian Covenanters, who opposed Charles I's attempts to interfere with the Scottish Church. In 1639, the Covenanters captured Tantallon while William, newly created Marquess of Douglas, was in Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Around 1570, of the {{at least}} 700 Protestant congregations in Poland-Lithuania, over 420 were Calvinist and over 140 Lutheran, {{with the latter}} {{including}} 30-40 ethnically Polish. Protestants encompassed approximately ½ of the magnate class, ¼ of other nobility and townspeople, and 1/20 of the non-Orthodox peasantry. The bulk of the Polish-speaking population <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> Catholic, but the proportion of Catholics became significantly diminished within the upper social ranks.|$|E

5|$|During {{the night}} of 1–2 February, Mubarak {{supporters}} and protesters clashed in Alexandria, where shots were reportedly fired into the air. Government forces and the police also fired into the crowd {{in an attempt to}} disperse the protesters. In Cairo, many protesters from the previous day <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> in Tahrir Square overnight.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, {{the city}} {{remained}} relatively small, no longer ranking {{among the major}} cities of Korea. During the early 20th century, many archaeological excavations were conducted, particularly inside the tombs which <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> largely intact over the centuries. A museum, the forerunner of the present-day Gyeongju National Museum, was inaugurated in 1915 to exhibit the excavated artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{baseband}} pass range {{used was}} 200Hz to 2500Hz but later the International Telecommunication Union {{set a standard}} of 300Hz to 3.4kHz with 4kHz spacing. Thus the filtering was required to go from fully pass to fully stop {{in the space of}} 900Hz. This standard in telephony is still in use today and <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of a commercial HRSV vaccine <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> elusive. Recent breakthroughs have sparked continued interest in this highly sought after vaccine as the annual medical burden relating to HRSV <b>has</b> <b>remained</b> high, equal to Influenza and Pneumococcus.|$|R

5|$|Juventus {{qualified}} for the Super Cup as the reigning European Cup Winners' Cup winners. They <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> unbeaten throughout the 1983–84 European Cup Winners' Cup, and beat Porto 2–1 in the final. It was Juventus' first appearance in the competition.|$|E
5|$|Kingston Lacy is {{a country}} house and estate near Wimborne Minster, Dorset, England. It was for many years the family seat of the Bankes family who lived nearby at Corfe Castle until its {{destruction}} in the English Civil War after its incumbent owners, Sir John Bankes and Dame Mary, <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> loyal to Charles I.|$|E
5|$|La Salle's mission <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> secret until 1686 {{when former}} {{expedition}} member Denis Thomas, who had deserted in Santo Domingo, {{was arrested for}} piracy. Trying to have his punishment reduced, Thomas informed his Spanish jailers of La Salle's plan to found a colony and eventually conquer Spanish silver mines. Despite his confession, Thomas was hanged.|$|E

5|$|On 27 January 2006, Fowler rejoined Liverpool from Manchester City on a free transfer, {{signing a}} {{contract}} {{until the end}} of the season.

5|$|The Achaean League {{was upset}} {{that one of}} its members <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> under Spartan {{occupation}} and persuaded the Romans to revisit their decision to leave Sparta's territorial gains intact. The Romans agreed with the Achaeans, as they did not want a strong and re-organized Sparta causing trouble after the Romans left Greece.|$|E
5|$|The last train ran on 4 July 1991, {{four days}} after the plant closed. Without {{production}} at the plants {{there was no need for}} the railway; it would be more economical to transport the few last products by truck. The final hauled several wagons down to the coast for scrapping. The closing of the Rjukan Line also terminated operations on the Tinnoset Line, where passenger traffic <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> until 1991.|$|E

As the band have developed, rock, pop, jazz, Cajun and country influences have all emerged, but the traditional Celtic roots and instrumentation <b>have</b> <b>remained.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{lineup of}} the live band had a {{tendency}} to change drastically between major tours: aside from Reznor remaining on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar, no member of the live band <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as {{part of the reason for}} these frequent personnel changes, as well as his desire for fresh interpretations of his music.|$|E
5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was {{the passage of}} a legislative redistricting bill. Despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could call a special session {{for the sole purpose of}} considering a redistricting bill. The legislators obliged, and passed a bill by the end of the special session.|$|E
5|$|After Peach's castle is {{sent back}} to the ground and Mario defeats Bowser, he recounts his tale to Luigi, who <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> at home while Mario went on the adventure. Peach throws a huge party to honor Mario and his allies for saving the entire kingdom, which is then {{followed}} by a parade during the credits. In the end, Mario and Peach exit their parade float and gaze up the sky, seeing fireworks. This part will not end until the player turns off the console. When restarted, the file will restart from the last save.|$|E

5|$|After being remanded to {{determine}} if the regulations were not discriminatory, the case returned to the United States Supreme Court in Department of Game of Washington v. Puyallup Tribe (Puyallyp II). Again, Justice Douglas wrote the opinion for the Court, but this time he struck down the state restrictions as discriminatory. Douglas noted that the restrictions for catching steelhead trout with nets <b>had</b> <b>remained,</b> and was a method used only by the Indians, whereas hook and line fishing was allowed but was used only by non-Indians. As such, the effect of the regulation allocated all of the steelhead trout fishing to sport anglers, and none to the tribes.|$|E
5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} {{moved into the}} southern celestial hemisphere. The comet was much less impressive to southern hemisphere observers {{than it had been}} in the northern hemisphere, but southerners were able to see the comet gradually fade from view during the second half of 1997. The last naked-eye observations were reported in December 1997, which meant that the comet <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> visible without aid for 569days, or about 18 and a half months. The previous record had been set by the Great Comet of 1811, which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months.|$|E
5|$|After leaving office, Voorhis {{remained}} in his Alexandria, Virginia, house, completing his book, Confessions of a Congressman. In early 1947, {{he was offered}} the job of {{executive director of the}} Cooperative League of the USA. The Voorhis family relocated to Winnetka, Illinois, near the League's Chicago headquarters. The League, which included both consumer and producer cooperatives, had fallen on hard times in the postwar period. Under his leadership, the League's financial position gradually improved and some major cooperatives that <b>had</b> <b>remained</b> aloof from the League were persuaded to join. The League expanded its purview, founding the Group Health Association of America and the National Association of Housing Cooperatives.|$|E
