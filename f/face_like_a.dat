500|$|Despite being {{popular with}} many, the {{character}} of Pauline has also garnered much criticism over the years. Persistent criticism {{has been given to}} the character's dowdy attire, particularly the perception that she rarely wears anything but a baggy cardigan; a claim that Wendy Richard herself categorically disputes. In addition, Pauline has also received much criticism for her miserable demeanour—"a <b>face</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> month of wet weekends" [...] and [...] "a voice that could curdle milk." [...] She has been described as the [...] "Wicked Witch of Walford" [...] and [...] "a character who became a byword for downtrodden haggery." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} {{commented on}} her cannibalistic tendencies. In a VentureBeat humor article by Jason Lomberg, Mileena [...] "tried {{her hand at}} stripping, modeling, and a stint on The View. But {{none of them could}} satisfy her insatiable desire for carnage and human flesh," [...] so she became Donald Trump’s co-host on The Apprentice. Ranking 1992's Mortal Kombat as the second-most controversial violent video game in history, CNN's Doug Gross noted that in the reboot, [...] "options include eating an opponent's head." [...] X360 chose her MK2011 Fatality, [...] "in which she tears a man's head off then chows down upon it", to represent cannibalism on their list of the top ten video game crimes. In a feature about Tommy Wiseau's 2011 web series The Tommy-Wi Show, Carl Lyon of Fearnet described Wiseau therein as [...] "an ambiguously-accented, sleepy-eyed 'actor' who chews scenery like Mileena on an opponent's throat." [...] Praising the 2011 reboot game for its inclusion of [...] "iconic" [...] characters and [...] "the quite remarkable violence," [...] GamesMaster opined one [...] "simply cannot watch Mileena throw swords into Johnny Cage, decapitate him and then take repeated bites out of his <b>face</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dog on death row without deeply desiring this game." [...] Mileena finishing move of devouring a still-living opponent in MKX was chosen as the most [...] "hardcore" [...] in the game by French website JeuxActu.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Abbahu {{taught that}} a cherub (as in [...] ) had a <b>face</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> child (keravya), for in Babylonia {{they called a}} child ravya. Rav Papa asked Abaye that if this is so, {{then there is a}} {{difficulty}} interpreting , which says of Ezekiel's vision, [...] "the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle." [...] Would not the face of the cherub and the face of a man be the same? The Gemara answered that one was a big face, and the other was a small face.|$|E
2500|$|English herald Arthur Charles Fox-Davies {{asserted}} in 1909 {{that the}} leopard, denoting a lion passant guardant, was {{a term of}} French origin that had [...] "long since become obsolete in English armory. In French blazon, however, the old distinction is still observed." [...] Fox-Davies continued, [...] " [...] term our lion passant a léopard-lionné and our lion rampant guardant is their lion-léopardé." [...] Dutch heraldist Johannes Rietstap, however, defined a Léopard lionné as a lion rampant guardant (i.e., upright like a lion with its head turned to full <b>face</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> leopard) and a Lion léopardé as a lion passant (i.e., walking like a leopard with its head facing dexter like a lion). German-American heraldist Carl-Alexander von Volborth agrees with Rietstap's translations, in contrast to those of Fox-Davies as stated above.|$|E
2500|$|Barrett Browning's sister Henrietta died in November 1860. The couple {{spent the}} winter of 1860–61 in Rome where Barrett Browning's health further {{deteriorated}} and they returned to Florence in early June 1861. She became gradually weaker, using morphine to ease her pain. She died on 29 June 1861 in her husband's arms. Browning said that she died [...] "smilingly, happily, and with a <b>face</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> girl's.... Her last word was... Beautiful". She {{was buried in the}} Protestant English Cemetery of Florence. [...] "On Monday July 1 the shops in the area around Casa Guidi were closed, while Elizabeth was mourned with unusual demonstrations." [...] The nature of her illness is still unclear. Some modern scientists speculate her illness may have been hypokalemic periodic paralysis, a genetic disorder that causes weakness and many of the other symptoms she described.|$|E

2500|$|Sito {{mentioned}} that Joe Grant contributed heavily towards the film, {{as he was}} the creator of Redfeather, Meeko, and Flit. Redfeather was a wise-cracking turkey planning to be voiced by John Candy, and Percy, who was to be voiced by Richard E. Grant, was revised to become mute. Following the death of John Candy in March 1994, co-screenwriter Susannah Grant decided the turkey was inappropriate for the script she co-wrote for Pocahontas, and a more realistic approach would have the animals pantomime instead of talking. Joe Grant stated Redfeather [...] "had comic potential–he thought he was handsome, a lady's man. When we decided he couldn't talk, and, having no hands, he couldn't mime..." [...] Grant would later draw a concept sketch of a hair-braiding raccoon, in which Glen Keane animated and claimed the directors [...] "loved the idea and {{got rid of the}} turkey character." [...] Likewise, according to Sito, Meeko was created because they were [...] "naturally enigmatic, because they have little hands and a little mask over their <b>face</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> thief." [...] Gabriel described the inspiration for Flit the hummingbird where [...] "I have hummingbirds all over my backyard, [...] I thought, 'That's a great animal to animate.'" [...] According to the directors, Governor Ratcliffe's pampered pet, Percy, was based on history as the royalty of the time often carried small pugs wherever they went.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Morgenstern, {{film critic}} for The Wall Street Journal, opened his review by asking: [...] "Is After Earth the worst movie ever made?" [...] His answer was [...] "Maybe not; there's always Battlefield Earth {{to remind us}} how low the bar can go." [...] Like Morgenstern, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times made note of the film's use of central themes in Scientology before {{concluding}} the film {{was nothing more than}} a [...] "big-screen vanity project". Los Angeles Times reviewer Betsy Sharkey wondered how the elder Smith could have gone from the charismatic performance in the serious film The Pursuit of Happyness, also co-starring his son, to the performance in After Earth. She also saw compounding problems in the creative process leading to a lack of subtlety and nuance: [...] "The script has no nuance, none. And when Shyamalan moves into the director's chair, the script problems are magnified." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety opined that the film was further proof that Shyamalan had become a [...] "director-for-hire", with [...] "his disinterest palpable from first frame to last". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film one star out of five, calling it [...] "another uncompromisingly terrible film ... featuring a triple-whammy of abysmal acting, directing and story" [...] and saying that Jaden Smith [...] "plays the role throughout with a <b>face</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> smacked bum" [...] and [...] "Kitai [...] must be like his dad: show no fear. Or any emotion. Or any acting talent of any sort." ...|$|E
