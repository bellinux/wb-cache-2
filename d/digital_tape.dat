5|$|When {{a hacker}} {{downloads}} decades' worth of classified information about aliens onto a <b>digital</b> <b>tape,</b> he {{gives it to}} Mulder, who finds that the entire tape is written in Navajo. Cigarette Smoking Man begins searching for the tape and visits Mulder's father, who calls Mulder to see him shortly afterwards. Before he can reveal anything to Mulder however, he is murdered by Alex Krycek. Scully brings Mulder to New Mexico where she introduces him to Albert Hosteen, a code-talker who can translate the <b>digital</b> <b>tape.</b> Albert's grandson shows Mulder a boxcar filled with alien corpses. Cigarette Smoking Man tracks Mulder's location however and orders the boxcar burned.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) hold each other at gunpoint. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), the person lingering outside his apartment, bursts in and forces Skinner to put his gun down.

A major part of the planning program is the prediction of water quality in rivers and lakes resulting from existing and future land uses. A model has been developed that can predict the flow of sediment, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and organic wastes into major streams. An essential input to this model is an accurate map of land use derived from LANDSAT 1 <b>digital</b> <b>tapes...</b>|$|R

5|$|Since its release, Loveless {{has been}} widely proclaimed by critics as among the best albums of the 1990s, as a {{landmark}} work of the shoegazing genre, and as a significant influence on various subsequent artists. The album was reissued as a two-CD set on Sony in May 2012, containing remastered editions of the original <b>digital</b> <b>tape</b> and a previously unreleased Â½-inch analogue tape. The reissues placed in several international charts and in July 2013, Loveless was certified Silver in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).|$|E
5|$|Both Mulder and Joan follow Jeraldine to Hong Kong, where Mulder {{learns that}} she is a {{middleman}} selling government secrets. Mulder tracks down Jeraldine and handcuffs himself to her. Arriving at her office, Mulder finds Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) waiting inside, having been selling the contents of the <b>digital</b> <b>tape.</b> Krycek escapes through a window while Jeraldine is shot by a group of men coming down the hallway. Mulder unlocks the handcuffs and escapes. Meanwhile, Joan walks down the hall and encounters the men, creating a flash that causes them all to suffer from the radiation burns.|$|E
50|$|Formats like ProDigi and DASH were {{referred}} to as SDAT (Stationary-head <b>Digital</b> Audio <b>Tape)</b> formats, as opposed to formats like the PCM adaptor-based systems and DAT, which {{were referred}} to as RDAT (Rotating-head <b>Digital</b> Audio <b>Tape)</b> formats, due to their helical-scan process of recording.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, Sony {{launched}} their Handycam products and the Video8 format. Video8 and the follow-on hi-band Hi8 format became {{popular in the}} consumer camcorder market. In 1987 Sony launched the 4 mm DAT or <b>Digital</b> Audio <b>Tape</b> as a new <b>digital</b> audio <b>tape</b> standard.|$|R
50|$|The {{technology}} of DAT is closely {{based on that}} of video recorders, using a rotating head and helical scan to record data.

5|$|In Two Grey Hills, New Mexico, Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman) and {{his family}} are beaten by the Men in Black as they search for the {{whereabouts}} of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is pursued by a black helicopter before soldiers retrieve her printed copies of Albert's translations of the <b>digital</b> <b>tape.</b> Scully denies having the original tape, saying it is in Mulder's possession. Upon returning to Washington, the FBI puts Scully on mandatory leave and forces her to turn in her badge and gun. Upon entering Mulder's office, she finds the tape missing.|$|E
5|$|Melissa calls Scully {{and tells}} her she is coming over. After {{receiving}} {{a call from}} someone who immediately hangs up, Scully leaves her apartment and tells Melissa that she'll head to her home instead. As she leaves, Skinner pulls up in his car, telling her they need to speak in private. Melissa shows up soon afterwards and is mistakenly shot by Luis Cardinal, who is hiding there with Alex Krycek. Realizing they shot the wrong person, the two flee. Meanwhile, after taking Skinner to Mulder's apartment, Scully holds him at gunpoint, believing he is the traitor the Well-Manicured Man spoke of. Skinner tells Scully {{that he is in}} possession of the <b>digital</b> <b>tape.</b> Just then, someone steps outside the door. This distracts Scully enough for Skinner to pull his gun on her.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{brings the}} gun to the FBI for {{comparison}} against the bullet that killed Bill. When Mulder awakens, he becomes angry and suspicious towards Scully. Later returning to his building, Scully finds his water being contaminated. As Mulder is entering in his building, he spots Krycek, whom he disarms and prepares to kill. However, Scully shoots him {{to prevent him from}} doing so, allowing Krycek to escape. Scully brings an unconscious Mulder to New Mexico and, when he awakens, reveals that his behavior was caused by a drug placed into his water supply and that she shot him because if he had killed Krycek, it then would have been harder to prove his innocence in his father's death. She then introduces him to Hosteen, who has been translating the files on the <b>digital</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Glen Meadows remastered the CD {{set from}} the digital masters {{archived}} by Donald Fagen, Gary Katz and Roger Nichols in 1982. These <b>digital</b> <b>tapes</b> were prepared because the original analog tapes were in very poor shape. The earliest CD mastering {{for all the}} Steely Dan albums in 1985 used these <b>digital</b> <b>tapes</b> but MCA inexplicably used deteriorating analog masters for all later CD pressings until the 1998 remasters. This information was discovered by Roger Nichols in 1991 {{when he was asked}} his opinion of the Mobile Fidelity Gold reissues of Aja and Gaucho. Nichols discovered that the [...] "Gaucho CD was even a different speed, about a quarter tone sharper" [...] when compared to the original CD that he was involved in.|$|R

500|$|Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, a new {{technique}} at the time which Corsaro believed {{was going to be}} the future of recording because test pressings always sounded consistent. To ensure this, Corsaro used a Sony 3324 24-track <b>digital</b> <b>tape</b> recorder and a Sony F1 two-track for the 12-bit mix. Madonna recorded the lead parts in a small, wooden, high-ceilinged piano room at the back of Studio C, also known as Power Station's [...] "R room". Corsaro then placed gobos around her while using the top capsule of a stereo AKG C24 tube microphone, with a Schoeps microphone preamplifier and a Pultec equalizer. Once the track met with everybody's approval, Robert Sabino added the keyboard parts, playing mostly a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, as well as some Rhodes piano and acoustic piano, while Rodgers also played a Synclavier. Madonna, although not required, was present every minute of the recording sessions and the mixing process, Corsaro commented: [...] "Nile was there most of the time, but she was there all of the time. She never left".|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} Springsteen's Born in the U.S.A. tour, Jackson {{expressed his}} ideas about possible improvements to digital audio {{in a conversation}} with Christof Heidelberger, a designer of digital audio electronics, and Betty Bennett, the president of Soundcraft's U.S. division. Jackson, Bennett and Heidelberger formed Apogee Electronics in December 1985 (announced in the 23 November issue of Billboard) and started investigating 44kHz digital audio circuits for audible problems. They found that [...] "textbook filters" [...] which were unnecessarily steep were protecting the CD player output from high levels of 20kHz signals, an exceedingly unlikely occurrence in music. Jackson determined that Apogee could improve the sound of CDs if the low-pass filters used in the recording process were made less steep, for less phase shift throughout the hearing range. The small company produced better anti-aliasing filters for recording equipment. Initially operating out of his garage, Jackson served as the company's owner and president, and his third wife Bennett headed up sales. They demonstrated their first product at the Audio Engineering Society's 81st convention held in Los Angeles in November 1986: the 944 Series low-dispersion, linear phase, active low-pass filter, intended to replace existing filters on multi-track <b>digital</b> <b>tape</b> recorders such as the Sony PCM-3324. After a slow start, the firm sold 30,000 of the filters: [...] "a great success." [...] The 944 earned a TEC Award in 1988, the first of many such awards for Apogee.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{establishes the}} same kinds of standards and controls that are currently in use for the procurement on new analog and <b>digital</b> magnetic <b>tapes.</b> The Magnetic Tape Certification Facility (MTCF) currently maintains a Quality Products List (QPL) for all new analog and <b>digital</b> magnetic <b>tapes</b> purchased by NASA-GSFC. Extensive tests are conducted in the MTCF on an annual basis to determine the manufacturer's tape types to be added to or deleted from the current QPL. The MTCF currently maintains two specifications for magnetic tapes: NASA TM- 79724 is used for the QPL and acceptance testing of new analog tapes; and NASA TM- 80599 is used for the QPL and acceptance testing of new <b>digital</b> <b>tapes.</b> This specification will be used for the QPL and acceptance testing of new 3480 cartridges.

2500|$|Built {{with the}} intent for {{eventual}} interstellar travel, Voyager 2 included a large, [...] parabolic, high-gain antenna (...) to transceive data via the Deep Space Network on the Earth. Communications are conducted over the S-band (about 13cm wavelength) and X-band (about 3.6cm wavelength) providing data rates as high as 115.2 kilobits per second at the distance of Jupiter, and then ever-decreasing as the distance increased, because of the inverse-square law.

2500|$|Brothers in Arms was {{recorded}} from November 1984 to March 1985 at AIR Studios {{on the island}} of Montserrat, a British overseas territory in the Caribbean. The album was produced by Mark Knopfler and Neil Dorfsman. Knopfler became aware of Dorfsman through his 1981 recording of the Wanderlust album by jazz vibraphonist Mike Mainieri. In 1982, Knopfler asked Dorfsman to work with him on the 1982 Dire Straits album, Love over Gold, and his 1983 soundtrack album Local Hero. Brothers in Arms {{was one of the first}} albums recorded on a Sony 24-track <b>digital</b> <b>tape</b> machine. The decision to move to digital recording came from Knopfler's constant striving for better sound quality. [...] "One of the things that I totally respected about him," [...] Dorfsman observed, [...] "was his interest in technology as a means of improving his music. He was always willing to spend on high-quality equipment." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} Galileo high-gain antenna meant that data storage {{to the tape}} {{recorder}} for later compression and playback was absolutely crucial {{in order to obtain}} any substantial information from the flybys of Jupiter and its moons. In October 1995, Galileo four-track, 114-megabyte <b>digital</b> <b>tape</b> recorder, which was manufactured by Odetics Corporation, remained stuck in rewind mode for 15 hours before engineers learned what had happened and sent commands to shut it off. Though the recorder itself was still in working order, the malfunction possibly damaged a length of tape {{at the end of the}} reel. This section of tape was subsequently declared [...] "off limits" [...] to any future data recording, and was covered with 25 more turns of tape to secure the section and reduce any further stresses, which could tear it. Because it happened only weeks before Galileo entered orbit around Jupiter, the anomaly prompted engineers to sacrifice data acquisition of almost all of the Io and Europa observations during the orbit insertion phase, in order to focus solely on recording data sent from the Jupiter probe descent.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of this breakdown can be immediately obvious even when rewinding the tape: tearing sounds and sluggish behavior. If a tape with sticky-shed syndrome is played, the reels will make screeching or squeaking sounds, and the tape will leave dusty, rusty particles on the guides and heads. In some cases, particularly with <b>digital</b> <b>tapes,</b> {{the symptoms are}} more subtle, causing intermittent dropouts.|$|R
