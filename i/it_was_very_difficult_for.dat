25|$|The Quaid Post {{was located}} at an {{altitude}} of 22,153 feet. It was extremely difficult to attack, as it was surrounded by 457 m high ice walls. It had an inclination of 80° to 85° on three sides, and a little less on the fourth side. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the attackers to climb up the peak without getting noticed by the Pakistani soldiers stationed at the top. The scarcity of oxygen made walking long distances difficult, as the troops had to halt every few meters to regain their breath. There were also frequent blizzards, and taking advantage of poor visibility at night was difficult due to the wind chill factor. The minimum temperatures in the area were as low as -50°C at that time.|$|E
25|$|In 1672, however, he {{was forced}} to take action. He entered into an {{alliance}} for the defence of the United Provinces during the Franco-Dutch War; then, after this league had collapsed owing to the defection of the elector of Brandenburg, the more durable Quadruple Alliance was formed for the same purpose, including, besides the emperor, the king of Spain and several German princes, and the war was renewed. At this time, twenty-five years after the Peace of Westphalia, the Empire was virtually a confederation of independent princes, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> its head to conduct any war with vigor and success, some of its members being in alliance with the enemy and others being only lukewarm in their support of the imperial interests. Thus this struggle, which lasted until the end of 1678, was on the whole unfavourable to Germany, and the advantages of the Treaty of Nijmegen were mostly with France. It can however be argued that the imperial intervention saved the Netherlands from a complete French invasion.|$|E

25|$|There were {{considerable}} {{difficulties in}} the operation of the contracts and the management of the men. During the period 1870–1875, power gradually transferred from the Provinces to the central government, partly because of the railway question. The Bill to abolish the Provinces was carried in October 1875 and implemented a year later. However, in the interim <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Brogdens to get clear prompt decisions. Brogdens got less work than they had hoped and it became available more slowly than expected. Communications between UK and New Zealand were obviously slow so it was difficult to know how many men to send at any given time. Sometimes Brogdens could not find work for the men when they arrived. Men reneged on their promissory notes. There were disputes over working hours, wages and whether they should be paid when the weather stopped the work. Gradually the men drifted away. By August 1873, 2172 English immigrants had been brought out. They included 1299 working-age men who were contracted to work for Brogdens for two years but only 287 of them were still working for them. Most of the men were agricultural labourers, rather than true navvies and they found local agricultural labour and working conditions more attractive than navvy work.|$|E
500|$|Secord's {{criticism}} {{may have}} been a little extreme. The Department of Defense had created the 7th/13 Air Force at Udon in November 1965 {{for the express purpose of}} conducting the air war in Laos. According to historian Timothy Castle, Sullivan relegated the Air Force commander and his staff [...] "to the status of clerks hired to carry out his airpower decisions." [...] The unconventional arrangement bred frustration and the 7th/13th constantly harped about the use of its air assets in northern Laos. There was constant criticism over the use of air power [...] "serving targets" [...] or utilizing modern fighter-bombers as [...] "long-range artillery." [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the Air Force to grasp that a guerrilla force did not fight like a conventional army.|$|E

She elaborated that scenes would be reenacted if cameras were not present for a significant occurrence between cast members, and commented that her relationship with Jenner was [...] "pretty brief" [...] and [...] "definitely [...] to drag it out".

500|$|O'Reilly {{was one of}} {{the best}} spin bowlers ever to play cricket. He {{delivered}} the ball from a two-fingered grip at close to medium pace with great accuracy, and could produce leg breaks, googlies, and top spinners, with no discernible change in his action. A tall man for a spinner (around 188cm, 6ft 2in), he whirled his arms to an unusual extent and had a low point of delivery that meant <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the batsman to read the flight of the ball out of his hand. When O'Reilly died, Sir Donald Bradman said that he was the greatest bowler he had ever faced or watched. In 1935, Wisden wrote of him: [...] "O'Reilly {{was one of the}} best examples in modern cricket of what could be described as a 'hostile' bowler." [...] In 1939, Wisden reflected on Bill O'Reilly's successful 1938 Ashes tour of England: [...] "He is emphatically one of the greatest bowlers of all time." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the market begins on nearby Justo Sierra Street, {{in an area where}} many {{university}} students lived in the 1950s, including young artists. A number of these artists such as Antonio Albanes, Armando Anguiano, Napoleon Panama, Efrain Reyes, Oswaldo Partida, Rafael Arles, Georgina Isita, and Jorge Contraras formed an association called “Grupo 23 Escalones” (23 Stairs Group) to share and critique each other's work. [...] It was at one of these sessions that Jorge Contraras proposed the idea of selling artworks on the steps of their studios and into the local parks on Sundays when people were out wandering the streets and parks. The reason behind this was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> young and unknown talent to get their work shown at conventional galleries and shows.|$|E

2500|$|The final {{category}} includes {{only one}} item: the trompetica china or corneta china (literally “Chinese trumpet/bugle”). [...] This double reed instrument, called suona in Chinese, {{was brought to}} Havana in the 19th century by Chinese immigrants. [...] It was being used to play traditional Chinese music in the Chinese theaters in Havana's Chinatown, when an Afro-Cuban comparsa named “Los Chinos Buenos” adapted it to use in place of an inspirador ("lead singer"). [...] Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> anyone not standing within ten feet of the inspirador to hear him or her singing during a street performance, the trompetica china, due to its peculiar raucous and nasal sound, could usually be heard by the entire comparsa and its followers. [...] In 1910, the trompetica china was brought to Santiago de Cuba by soldiers of the Cuban army (Ortíz II 1952-5:451). The first conga to incorporate its use was Paso Franco in 1915 (del Carmen et al. 2005). [...] By 1924, it was a well-established feature of the conga (Pérez; I 1988:310). Today, the sound of this instrument is recognized by Cubans as {{the symbol of the}} carnavales of Oriente.|$|E
2500|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} women were forced into {{industry}} jobs between 1940-1943. As surveyed by the Ministry of Labour, {{the percentage of women}} in industrial jobs went from 19.75 per cent to 27 per cent from 1938-1945. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> women to spend their days in factories, and then come home to their domestic chores and care-giving, and as a result, many women were unable to hold their jobs in the workplace. Britain underwent a labour shortage where an estimated 1.5 million people were needed for the armed forces, and an additional 775,000 for munitions and other services in 1942. It was during this ‘labour famine’ that propaganda aimed to induce people to join the labour force and do their bit in the war. Women were the target audience in the various forms of propaganda because they were paid substantially less than men. It was of no concern whether women were filling the same jobs that men previously held. Even if women were replacing jobs with the same skill level as a man, they were still paid significantly less due to their gender. [...] In the engineering industry alone, the number of skilled and semi-skilled female workers increased from 75 per cent to 85 per cent from 1940-1942. [...] According to Gazeley, even though women were paid less than men, it is clear that women engaging in war work and taking on jobs preserved by men reduced industrial segregation.|$|E
