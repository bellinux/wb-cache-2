40|$|Background: This paper {{describes}} a systematic review and meta-analyses on effects of environmental noise on annoyance. The noise sources include aircraft, road, and rail transportation noise {{as well as}} wind turbines and noise source combinations. Objectives: Update knowledge about effects of environmental noise on {{people living in the}} vicinity of noise sources. Methods: Eligible were published studies (2000 – 2014) providing comparable acoustical and social survey data including exposure-response functions between standard indicators of noise exposure and standard annoyance responses. The systematic literature search in 20 data bases resulted in 62 studies, of which 57 were used <b>for</b> quantitative <b>meta-analyses.</b> <b>By</b> means of questionnaires sent to the study authors, additional study data were obtained. Risk of bias was assessed by means of study characteristics for individual studies and by funnel plots to assess the risk of publication bias. Main Results: Tentative exposure-response relations for percent highly annoyed residents (%HA) in relation to noise levels for aircraft, road, rail, wind turbine and noise source combinations are presented as well as meta-analyses of correlations between noise levels and annoyance raw scores, and the OR for increase of %HA with increasing noise levels. Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE terminology. The evidence of exposure-response relations between noise levels and %HA is moderate (aircraft and railway) or low (road traffic and wind turbines). The evidence of correlations between noise levels and annoyance raw scores is high (aircraft and railway) or moderate (road traffic and wind turbines). The evidence of ORs representing the %HA increase by a certain noise level increase is moderate (aircraft noise), moderate/high (road and railway traffic), and low (wind turbines). Strengths and Limitations: The strength of the evidence is seen in the large total sample size encompassing the included studies (e. g., 18, 947 participants in aircraft noise studies). Main limitations are due to the variance in the definition of noise levels and %HA. Interpretation: The increase of %HA in newer studies of aircraft, road and railway noise at comparable Lden levels of earlier studies point to the necessity of adjusting noise limit recommendations. Funding: The review was funded by WHO Europe...|$|R

40|$|The present {{road safety}} {{situation}} is reviewed for Europe, Australia, Canada, Japan, and the developing countries. Every year, {{there are about}} 500, 000 road accident fatalities worldwide. Although increasing traffic would {{lead to an increase}} in fatalities and injuries, in the absence of effective road safety management, the problem of road accidents is not insoluble.

Better roads improve road safety. Promising new developments include: road safety targets, safety auditing, sustainable safe traffic, improved police enforcement, and the application of telematics. Important road safety policies include: raising public awareness, marketing road safety measures, organising policy, and financing accident prevention.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Positive {{results have}} a greater chance of being {{published}} and outcomes that are statistically significant {{have a greater}} chance of being fully reported. One consequence of research underreporting {{is that it may}} influence the sample of studies that is available for a meta-analysis. Smaller studies are often characterized by larger effects in published meta-analyses, which can be possibly explained by publication bias. We investigated the association between the statistical significance of the results and the probability of being included in recent <b>meta-analyses.</b> METHODS: <b>For</b> <b>meta-analyses</b> of clinical trials, we defined the relative risk as the ratio of the probability of including statistically significant results favoring the treatment to the probability of including other results. <b>For</b> <b>meta-analyses</b> of other studies, we defined the relative risk as the ratio of the probability of including biologically plausible statistically significant results to the probability of including other results. We applied a Bayesian selection model <b>for</b> <b>meta-analyses</b> that included at least 30 studies and were published in four major general medical journals (BMJ, JAMA, Lancet, and PLOS Medicine) between 2008 and 2012. RESULTS: We identified 49 meta-analyses. The estimate of the relative risk was greater than one in 42 meta-analyses, greater than two in 16 meta-analyses, greater than three in eight meta-analyses, and greater than five in four meta-analyses. In 10 out of 28 meta-analyses of clinical trials, there was strong evidence that statistically significant results favoring the treatment {{were more likely to be}} included. In 4 out of 19 meta-analyses of observational studies, there was strong evidence that plausible statistically significant outcomes had a higher probability of being included.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present review is to {{evaluate}} the effects of common risk factors <b>for</b> suicide <b>by</b> <b>meta-analyses</b> using data extracted from studies based on the psychological autopsy method. We focused on five common risk factors of suicide: substance-related disorders, mood disorders, adverse marital status, adverse employment status, and self-harm behaviors. A total of 24 articles were identified from MEDLINE in which the crude odds ratio (OR) could be calculated for the above five risk factors through 30 April 2007, using such search keywords as “suicide,” “psychological autopsy,” and “case-control study. ” Overall, both substance-related disorders [OR =  5. 24; 95 % confidence interval (CI)  =  3. 30 – 8. 31] and mood disorders [OR =  13. 42; 95 % CI =  8. 05 – 22. 37] were strongly associated with suicidal risk. Suicidal attempt and deliberate self-harm, which can directly lead to completed suicide, {{have been shown to be}} very strongly associated with suicidal risk [OR =  16. 33; 95 % CI =  7. 51 – 35. 52]. Effects of social factors such as adverse marital and employment status were relatively small. As substance-related disorders and mood disorders were strongly associated with an increased risk of completed suicide, the comorbidity of these two disorders should be paid a maximum attention. The effective prevention of suicide depends on whether we can successfully incorporate these personal factors as well as social factors into an adequate multi-factorial model...|$|R

Our principal aim was {{to test the hypothesis}} that plantations contain higher species richness or abundance than pasture. Of the 1967 studies of potential relevance, 66 provided biological monitoring information and 36 met the requirements <b>for</b> <b>meta-analyses.</b> Sufficient data were available <b>for</b> <b>meta-analyses</b> to be conducted comparing the species richness and abundance of plantations and pasture lands for five taxonomic groups: plants, invertebrates, reptiles/amphibians, mammals, and birds.

Birds and reptile/amphibians exhibited significantly higher species richness, and mammals exhibited significantly higher abundance, in plantations than in pasture lands which lacked remnant vegetation. Reptile/amphibian species richness was significantly higher in plantations in general. No significant differences in species richness were found for mammals, plants, or invertebrates, and no significant differences in abundance were found for birds, reptiles/amphibians, invertebrates, or plants. It is only within the presence of taxonomic caveats (i. e. reptiles/amphibians), or specific landscape features (i. e. absence of remnant vegetation within pasture), that it can be concluded that plantations support higher species richness or abundance than pasture land.
