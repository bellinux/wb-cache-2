This solvent extraction process employs the extractant 4 {prime}, 4 {prime}(5 {prime}) di-(t-butylcyclohexano) - 18 -crown- 6 in 1 -octanol or a mixture of tributyl phosphate and a hydrocarbon diluent called Isopar L{reg_sign}. Process <b>flowsheets</b> have been designed for testing in countercurrent experiments with centrifugal contractors. The <b>flowsheets</b> have been designed using batch contract solvent extraction methods. The extraction of Sr {{as well as other}} interfering ions has been studied. The effect of various parameters including nitric acid dependence, extractant concentration dependence, hydronium ion concentration, and interferent concentrations upon the extraction efficiency of the process has been evaluated. The radiolysis of the SREX solvent has also been investigated as a function of absorbed gamma radiation.

40|$|Two hybrid sulfur (HyS) cycle process <b>flowsheets</b> {{intended}} for use with high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) are presented. The <b>flowsheets</b> were developed for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) program, and couple a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer for the SO 2 -depolarized electrolysis step with a silicon carbide bayonet reactor for the high-temperature decomposition step. One presumes an HTGR reactor outlet temperature (ROT) of 950 C, the other 750 C. Performance was improved (over earlier <b>flowsheets)</b> by assuming that use of a more acid-tolerant PEM, like acid-doped poly[2, 2 '-(m-phenylene) - 5, 5 '-bibenzimidazole] (PBI), instead of Nafion{reg_sign}, would allow higher anolyte acid concentrations. Lower ROT was accommodated by adding a direct contact exchange/quench column upstream from the bayonet reactor and dropping the decomposition pressure. Aspen Plus was used to develop material and energy balances.

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 While process {{synthesis}} has matured {{in the areas}} of heat exchanger and separation synthesis, reactor network synthesis still remains a challenging problem. Advances in this area have been due to recent developments in methods for superstructure optimization as well as powerful concepts for reactor network targeting before a network is actually developed. In this paper we apply the latter approach to the synthesis of waste minimizing process <b>flowsheets.</b> This area has attracted much interest in the past five years, especially since waste minimization at the source is {{the most effective way to}} develop clean and efficient processes. Moreover, the characteristics of these <b>flowsheets</b> are primarily influenced by the reactor network. This study deals with targeting concepts introduced by Horn (1964), developed by Glasser, Hildebrandt and Crowe (1987) and adapted to an optimization framework by Balakrishna and Biegler (1992). Also, we apply concepts of waste minimization and multicriterion optimization, to incorporate the tradeoffs of minimum waste and maximum profit. This approach will be demonstrated on the Williams Otto and Van de Vusse <b>flowsheets,</b> where the potential for developing profitable waste minimizing processes will be shown. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of the targeting procedure to integrate the energy and separation subsystems as well. This further increases the potential for process improvement. 2 ̆...|$|R
