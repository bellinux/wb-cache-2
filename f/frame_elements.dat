Together with zinc, copper wires may be installed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss.

Copper alloys are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry for all those that are electronically amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning heads on guitars and other string instruments; string windings on harps, pianos, harpsichords, and string instruments; and the <b>frame</b> <b>elements</b> of pianos and harps.

40|$|The central {{edge of an}} {{opposing}} pair of luminance gradients (COC edge) makes adjoining regions with identical luminance appear to be different. This brightness illusion, called the Craik-O'Brien-Cornsweet effect (COCe), {{can be explained by}} low-level spatial filtering mechanisms (Dakin & Bex, 2003). Also, the COCe is greatly reduced when the stimulus lacks a <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> surrounding the COC edge (Purves et al., 1999). This indicates that the COCe can be modulated by extra contextual cues that are related to ideas about lighting priors. In this study, we examined whether processing for contextual modulation could be independent of the main COCe processing mediated by the filtering mechanism. We displayed the COC edge and <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> at physically different times. Then, while varying the onset asynchrony between them and changing the luminance contrast of the <b>frame</b> <b>element,</b> we measured the size of the COCe. We found that the COCe was observed in the temporal range of around 600 - 800 ms centered at the 0 ms (from around - 400 to 400 ms in stimulus onset asynchrony), which was much larger than the range of typical visual persistency. More importantly, this temporal range did not change significantly regardless of differences in the luminance contrast of the <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> (5 - 100 %), in the durations of COC edge and/or the <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> (50 or 200 ms), in the display condition (interocular or binocular), and in the type of lines constituting the <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> (solid or illusory lines). Results suggest that the visual system can bind the COC edge and <b>frame</b> <b>element</b> with a temporal window of ~ 1 sec to estimate surface brightness.

40|$|There {{seems to}} be many {{situations}} where an inelastic analysis needs to be performed on a frame structure. In the last decades, the subject has received much interest from many researchers, especially for seismic applications.

In such models, each frame member is represented by an elastic element, with several nonlinear springs, mostly located {{at the ends of}} the element. These models suffer several deficiencies, mentioned in the context. To overcome such deficiencies, a new approach is suggested for the construction of inelastic stiffness matrix of the <b>frame</b> <b>element.</b> In the proposed method, some virtual inelastic springs are attached to the elastic element.
