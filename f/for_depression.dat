40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that family factors {{play a role in}} the development, maintenance and course of youth depression. However, to date few clinical trials of psychotherapy <b>for</b> youth <b>depression</b> employ family therapy interventions or target the known family risk factors. This is surprising given recent meta-analytic findings showing only modest effect sizes for psychotherapy <b>for</b> youth <b>depression,</b> and that cognitive therapies do not outperform non-cognitive therapies. The aim of this review is to 1) use a developmental systems approach to review empirical evidence on family risk factors <b>for</b> youth <b>depression</b> to identify potential targets for treatment, 2) examine the extent to which these family risk factors have been targeted in clinical trials <b>for</b> youth <b>depression,</b> and 3) provide a road map for the development of empirically validated family-based interventions <b>for</b> youth <b>depression.</b> Strong evidence was found supporting a relationship between family factors at multiple system levels and depressive symptoms or disorders. Support for several different hypothesized causal mechanisms as well as bidirectional effects was found. A comparison of the identified risk factors and psychotherapy trials <b>for</b> youth <b>depression</b> indicated that few RCT's target family factors; among those that do, only a few of the family risk factors are targeted. Recommendations for translation of empirical knowledge of family risk factors and mechanisms to develop empirically valid family-based interventions to enhance existing treatments <b>for</b> youth <b>depression</b> are provided...|$|R

5|$|Fatigue: fatigue is {{very common}} and {{disabling}} in MS, {{and at the same}} time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology. When depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated <b>for</b> <b>depression</b> before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them. A few medications have been studied to treat MS-related fatigue, such as amantadine pemoline (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy), or modafinil, as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of all of them are small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.|$|E

Considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria seventy articles were retained. Validation studies of the Beck Depression Inventory-II, in both primary care and hospital settings, were found for clinics of cardiology, neurology, obstetrics, brain injury, nephrology, chronic pain, chronic fatigue, oncology, and infectious disease. The Beck Depression Inventory-II showed high reliability and good correlation with measures of depression and anxiety. Its threshold <b>for</b> detecting <b>depression</b> varied according to the type of patients, suggesting the need for adjusted cut-off points. The somatic and cognitive-affective dimension described the latent structure of the instrument. The Beck Depression Inventory-II can be easily adapted in most clinical conditions <b>for</b> detecting major <b>depression</b> and recommending an appropriate intervention. Although this scale represents a sound path <b>for</b> detecting <b>depression</b> in patients with medical conditions, the clinician should seek evidence for how to interpret the score before using the Beck Depression Inventory-II to make clinical decision...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to report the pattern of hospitalization <b>for</b> major <b>depression</b> among older Americans and to examine correlates of those hospitalizations. We sought to investigate the hypothesis that hospitaliza-tion <b>for</b> major <b>depression</b> would be more common among those respondents with declining functional status whose ability to adapt to this decline was impaired by inadequate social support systems or economic stressors. Methods. The data were taken from Version 5 of the Longitudinal Study on Aging (LSOA), which includes 7, 527 subjects who were aged 70 and older in 1984. We identified all subjects with any hospitalizations <b>for</b> which major <b>depression</b> was a discharge diagnosis (ICD 9 -CM codes 296. 2, 296. 3, 300. 4, and 311), and all subjects <b>for</b> whom <b>depression</b> was the primary discharge diagnosis. Only patients with a first-listed discharge diagnosis of depression were considered to have been hospitalized <b>for</b> major <b>depression.</b> Results. The yearly incidence of hospitalization <b>for</b> which <b>depression</b> was the primary discharge diagnosis was 0. 1 %. The mean length of stay was 14. 6 days and the mean hospital charge was $ 6, 742. Length of stay and charges did not vary by hospital type (general vs psychiatric), but both charges and length of stay were significantly longer when major depression was the primary discharge diagnosis rather than a secondary diagnosis. Patients with a hospitalization <b>for</b> major <b>depression</b> had more hospitalizations, longer total lengths of stay, and greater total hospital charges over the seven-year period as compared to patients with at least one hospitalization for any other reason.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The little {{information}} available about prescribing patterns {{for persons with}} posttraumatic stress disorder comes from male combat-veteran populations treated through programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The objective {{of this study was}} to comprehensively evaluate prescribing patterns for persons with a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a community-based nonveteran sample in which women were well represented. METHODS: Prescription claims paid in December 1999 for New Hampshire Medicaid recipients with diagnostic codes for PTSD were analyzed. Frequencies of prescriptions for categories of medication were compared between patients with PTSD (N= 165) and patients with major depression alone (N= 2, 208) and those with major depression co-occurring with PTSD (N= 171). RESULTS: The patients with PTSD were predominantly women who were receiving services at community mental health centers. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were more frequently prescribed <b>for</b> major <b>depression</b> (32 percent of cases) than for PTSD (23 percent). Other novel antidepressants were more frequently prescribed <b>for</b> major <b>depression</b> co-occurring with PTSD (25 percent of cases) than <b>for</b> major <b>depression</b> alone (18 percent). Atypical antipsychotic medications were more frequently prescribed for PTSD (17 percent of cases) and <b>for</b> major <b>depression</b> co-occurring with PTSD (20 percent) than <b>for</b> major <b>depression</b> alone (9 percent). Benzodiazepines and related hypnotics, trazodone, and mood stabilizers were more frequently prescribed <b>for</b> major <b>depression</b> co-occurring with PTSD than <b>for</b> major <b>depression</b> alone. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that many outpatients who have PTSD are treated aggressively with medication, particularly when PTSD co-occurs with major depression, and that there are discrepancies between actual prescribing patterns and prescribing guidelines. These findings overlap trends observed in veteran populations...|$|R

For five years, Lubitz had frequently been unable to sleep {{because of what he}} believed were vision problems; he consulted over forty doctors and feared he was going blind.

5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk <b>for</b> <b>depression,</b> particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E

40|$|Objective. Arguing that {{additional}} symptoms {{should be added}} to the criteria <b>for</b> atypical <b>depression.</b> Method. Published research articles on atypical depression are reviewed. Results. (1) The original studies upon which the criteria <b>for</b> atypical <b>depression</b> were based cited fatigue, insomnia, pain, and loss of weight as characteristic symptoms. (2) Several studies of DSM depressive criteria found patients with atypical depression to exhibit high levels of insomnia, fatigue, and loss of appetite/weight. (3) Several studies have found atypical depression to be comorbid with headaches, bulimia, and body image issues. (4) Most probands who report atypical <b>depression</b> meet criteria <b>for</b> “somatic depression,” defined as depression associated with several of disordered eating, poor body image, headaches, fatigue, and insomnia. The gender difference in prevalence of atypical depression results from its overlap with somatic depression. Somatic depression is associated with psychosocial measures related to gender, linking it with the descriptions of atypical depression as “reactive” appearing in the studies upon which the original criteria <b>for</b> atypical <b>depression</b> were based. Conclusion. Insomnia, disordered eating, poor body image, and aches/pains should be added as criteria <b>for</b> atypical <b>depression</b> matching criteria <b>for</b> somatic <b>depression</b> defining a reactive depressive disorder possibly distinct from endogenous melancholic depression...|$|R

A further cache of papers was discovered in November 1974, by builders renovating a London office formerly used by Bessell.
