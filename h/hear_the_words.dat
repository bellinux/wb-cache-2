500|$|The {{influential}} critic Ernest Newman considered The Perfect Fool [...] "the best {{of modern}} British operas", but its unusually short length (about an hour) and parodic, whimsical nature—described by The Times as [...] "a brilliant puzzle"—put it outside the operatic mainstream. Only the ballet {{music from the}} opera, which The Times called [...] "the most brilliant thing in a work glittering with brilliant moments", has been regularly performed since 1923. Holst's libretto attracted much criticism, although Edwin Evans remarked on the rare treat in opera {{of being able to}} <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> being sung.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, {{after an}} {{internal}} debate {{that had been}} going on since 1991, ENO announced that surtitles would be introduced at the Coliseum. Surveys had shown that only a quarter of audience members could <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> clearly. With a few exceptions, including Lesley Garrett and Andrew Shore, ENO singers of the 21st century were considered to have poorer diction than earlier singers such as Masterson and Derek Hammond-Stroud. Harewood and Pountney had been immovably opposed to surtitles, as both believed that opera in English was pointless if it could not be understood. [...] Harewood thought, moreover, that surtitles could undermine the case for a publicly funded opera-in-English company. The editor of Opera magazine, Rodney Milnes, campaigned against surtitles on the grounds that [...] "singers would give up trying to articulate clearly and audiences would cease focusing on the stage". Despite these objections, surtitles were introduced from October 2005.|$|E

500|$|In the song's final bridge section, at 2:58, {{the spoken}} phrase [...] "Fucking hell!" [...] appears. Scott admits that {{although}} he was told about it, he could not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> originally. Lennon attributed the expletive to McCartney, according to Emerick, who reports Lennon's comment in his autobiography: [...] "'Paul hit a clunker on the piano and said a naughty word,' Lennon gleefully crowed, 'but I insisted we leave it in , buried just low enough {{so that it can}} barely be heard. Most people won't ever spot it ... but we'll know it's there.'" [...] Womack considers that the expletive was actually uttered by Lennon. Malcolm Toft, the mix engineer on the Trident recording, also attributes it to Lennon. In Toft's recollection, Lennon was overdubbing his harmony vocal when, in reaction to the volume being too loud in his headphones, he first called out [...] "Whoa!" [...] then, two seconds later, swore as he pulled the headphones off.|$|E
500|$|Paul Schrodt of Slant Magazine {{was more}} {{critical}} in his review, though {{he gave it}} a 2.5star (out of 4) rating. While he positively called Gaga's performances outrageous and [...] "occasionally fierce", he questioned Gaga's authenticity, both on stage and in the pre-concert scenes. Ultimately, he wrote, [...] "Unsurprisingly, HBO's Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden raises more questions about Stefani Germanotta (Gaga's birth name) than it answers, which is probably as it should be." [...] Radio host Howard Stern also compared the black-and-white scenes of the special to Madonna: Truth or Dare, adding that when he darts a glance at Lady Gaga, she is occasionally registered in his brain as Madonna. On his show, Stern was also critical of inappropriateness and unreasonability of the numerous speeches Gaga gave between the songs in the special, calling them [...] "", [...] "drivel", and [...] "condescending". Dedicating over {{half an hour of}} his show on May 9 and 10, 2011, to express his criticism of the concert, Stern compared the manner of Gaga's speaking to professional wrestling due to echoing, Gaga's gasping between the words, and the audience's arguable inability to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> enough to understand them. In particular, Gaga claimed in the concert that her incentive to work is to [...] "set [...] free", not money. Stern attempted to debunk that claim by arguing that Gaga takes potentially psychiatric problems of her audience lightly by urging her fans to [...] "forget all of [...] insecurities" [...] overnight.|$|E

To reach the 32R run-up pad, Flight 954 {{would have had to}} turn around and return to the end of Runway 14L, where it had just landed, taxiing against the flow of traffic; instead, Flight 954's captain and first officer both assumed that the {{ground controller}} understood that they were [...] "inside the bridge" [...] and was referring to the 32L run-up pad, which was located at the southeast end of Runway 14R, {{on the other side of}} the terminal from the 32R run-up pad. Assuming that they were cleared to taxi to the 32L pad, they proceeded toward it using the Bridge, Outer Circular, and North–South taxiways, via a route that intersected with Runway 27L.|$|E

2500|$|Schweitzer {{continues}} {{writing in}} The Quest of the Historical Jesus {{that it is}} totally unreasonable to think that [...] "coming quickly", [...] "near", and [...] "soon" [...] could mean hundreds of years, much less, thousands {{of years in the}} future. [...] "Blessed is he who reads and those who <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near." [...] (Revelation 1:3) [...] "And he said to me, 'These words are faithful and true'; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond-servants the things which must soon take place." [...] "And behold, I am coming quickly. Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book." [...] And he said to me, [...] "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near" [...] (Revelation 22:6, 7, 10, 12). [...] "All these things shall come upon this generation" [...] (Matthew 23:36). Schweitzer concludes that the 1st-century theology, originating in the lifetimes of those who first followed Jesus, is totally incompatible with modern Christian belief.|$|E
2500|$|In The Quest of the Historical Jesus, Schweitzer {{observes the}} Bible contradicting the {{possibility}} of important events that never took place and never can take place as they are described; Jesus specifically states that we are to [...] "not seal up {{the words of the}} prophecy" [...] and promises that some of his listeners as well as the high priest at his trial would be alive to see him return to the Earth. [...] "Blessed is he who reads and those who <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of the prophecy, and heed the things which are written in it; for the time is near" [...] (Revelation 1:3). Saint Paul spoke of the [...] "last times": [...] "Brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none" [...] (1 Corinthians 7:29); [...] "God hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son" [...] (Hebrews 1:2); [...] "There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom" [...] (Matthew 16:28) (or, [...] "until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power" [...] (Mark 9:1); or, [...] "till they see the kingdom of God" [...] (Luke 9:27).) ...|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, I beseeched the Lord {{to teach}} me His statutes. After my prayer as usual I opened my Bible with closed eyes and {{put my finger on}} the right place.

[...] And again I opened the Bible, that time on 1 Timothy 1:15"This is a {{faithful}} saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief." [...] And for the third time I tempted the Lord, saying: [...] "O Lord! I am not an Abraham nor a Jew, I'm a sinner, but involve me to understand Your Will." [...] And then I opened the Book of SirahJoshua 24:29-30, where I read in the new American Translation: [...] "Said to myself, I will water my plants, my flower bed I will drench; and suddenly this rivulet of mine became a river, then this stream of mine, a sea. Thus do I send my teaching forth shining like a dawn, to become known afar off. Thus do I pour out instruction like prophecy and bestow it on generations to come." ...|$|E
