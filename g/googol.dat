25|$|Oscillococcinum is a homeopathic {{preparation}} made from Muscovy duck liver and heart manufactured by the French company Boiron; similar products {{are also available}} from other manufacturers.

25|$|Such {{evidence}} {{does not constitute}} proof. For example, the Mertens conjecture is a statement about natural numbers that is now known to be false, but no explicit counterexample (i.e., a natural number n for which the Mertens function M(n) equals or exceeds the square root of n) is known: all numbers less than 1014 have the Mertens property, and the smallest number {{that does not have}} this property is only known to be less than the exponential of 1.59×1040, which is approximately 10 to the power 4.3×1039. Since the number of particles in the universe is generally considered less than 10 to the power 100 (a <b>googol),</b> there is no hope to find an explicit counterexample by exhaustive search.|$|E

40|$|Scientists have {{measured}} {{that what}} we can see of space is about a billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion (10 ^ 81) times the volume of an average human. Inflationary theory suggests that the entirety of space is vastly larger. Quantum theory {{suggests that there are}} very many different copies of space of the same basic kind as ours (same laws of physics). String theory further suggests that there may be many different kinds of space. This whole collection of googolplexes of galaxies within each of googolplexes of different spaces within each of <b>googols</b> of kinds of space makes up an enormously vast universe or multiverse or holocosm. Human beings seem to be an incredibly small part of this universe in terms of physical size. Yet in other ways, we may still be a very significant part of our vast universe.

2500|$|For instance, it {{has been}} {{estimated}} that the yeast scaffold protein Ste5 can be a part of 25666 unique protein complexes. In E. coli, chemotaxis receptors of four different kinds interact in groups of three, and each individual receptor can exist in at least two possible conformations and has up to eight methylation sites, resulting in billions of potential states. The protein kinase CaMKII is a dodecamer of twelve catalytic subunits, arranged in two hexameric rings. [...] Each subunit can exist in at least two distinct conformations, and each subunit features various phosphorylation and ligand binding sites. A recent model incorporated conformational states, two phosphorylation sites and two modes of binding calcium/calmodulin, for a total of around one billion possible states per hexameric ring. A model of [...] coupling of the EGF receptor to a MAP kinase cascade presented by Danos and colleagues accounts for [...] distinct molecular species, yet the authors note several points at which the model could be further extended. A more recent model of ErbB receptor signalling even accounts for more than one <b>googol</b> (...) distinct molecular species. The problem of combinatorial explosion is also relevant to synthetic biology, with a recent model of a relatively simple synthetic eukaryotic gene circuit featuring 187 species and 1165 reactions.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>googol</b> has {{no special}} {{significance}} in mathematics.

Kasner used it to illustrate the difference between an unimaginably large number and infinity, and in this role it is sometimes used in teaching mathematics.
