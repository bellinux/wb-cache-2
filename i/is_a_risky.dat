25|$|Poke check: When the goaltender {{wants to}} poke the puck {{away from an}} {{opposing}} player, he quickly slides his hand up the stick, thrusting forward towards the puck. An improperly played poke check <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risky</b> play; the goaltender may miss, and the puck-carrier will be left with an unguarded net. In tight situations, a quick, hard jab could be used.|$|E

25|$|Speculation {{in stocks}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risky</b> and complex {{occupation}} because {{the direction of}} the markets are generally unpredictable and lack transparency, also financial regulators are sometimes unable to adequately detect, prevent and remediate irregularities committed by malicious listed companies or other financial market participants. In addition, the financial markets are usually subjected to speculation. This does not invalidate the well documented true and genuine stories of large success and consistent profitability of many individual stock investors and stock investing organizations along the history.|$|E
25|$|This shot, though risky in the execution, has the {{advantage}} of being aimed at a section of the field where a fielder is rarely placed – particularly in Twenty20 and One Day International cricket where the number of outfielders is limited. However the Marillier shot is played over the batsman's shoulder to fine leg, but the basis of the scoop stroke is for the batsman to go down on one knee to a good length or slightly short-of-length delivery off a fast or medium paced bowler and scoop the ball over the head of the wicket-keeper. The scoop shot <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risky</b> shot to play as the improper execution of this shot may lead to a catch being offered. One famous example of the scoop backfiring is of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 Final when Pakistan were 152/9 and needed 6 runs off 4 balls and Misbah-ul-Haq improperly executed this shot resulting in a catch to Sreesanth.|$|E

Lawmakers {{from both sides of the}} aisle, including Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Representative Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD) have been outspoken critics of the Pentagon in the matter—Bartlett recently claiming that [...] "they had this conversation outside the partnership and we regret that." [...] Loren Thompson, an analyst for the Lexington Institute, stated [...] "I do not believe that the story of VH-71 is over... Secretary Gates has not made a convincing case for terminating the program, and there is no alternative helicopter that can satisfy range and payload requirements while still landing on the White House lawn." ...|$|E

500|$|In combat, a Djinni {{has several}} uses. Each Set Djinni {{has a special}} ability which can be invoked during combat by the {{character}} it is attached to, which can include enhanced elemental attacks, buffing/debuffing spells, healing/restoration spells, and other effects. After a successful invoke, the Djinni shifts to [...] "Standby" [...] mode until it is [...] "Set" [...] on the character again. While in standby, the Djinn do not contribute to statistics or change character classes, but {{can be used for}} summon spells, which are attacks where the player summons a powerful elemental monster to inflict damage on every enemy and increases the respective characters affinity for that element for a duration. This is the game's most powerful method of attack, but the required switch to Standby mode <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risky</b> trade-off: Djinn used for summoning must rest for several turns before reverting to the Set position, during which time they cannot bolster statistics or classes. There are sixteen Summon Sequences in Golden Sunfour for each elementand each summon sequence requires between one and four Djinn of the same element on Standby.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{analysis}} of the protest movement for the Daily Bruin, journalist Jordan Manalastas commented, [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day is a chance to reinstate offense and sincerity to their proper place, freed from terror or silence. ... The proper (and, at the risk of looking jingoistic, American) way to combat bad speech is with better speech. To silence and be silenced are the refuge of cowards." [...] In {{an analysis}} of the protest movement for Spiked, Brendan O'Neill was critical of the concept of [...] "mocking Muhammad," [...] writing, [...] "... these two camps – the Muhammad-knockers and the Muslim offence-takers – are locked in a deadly embrace. Islamic extremists need Western depictions of Muhammad as evidence that there is a new crusade against Islam, while the Muhammad-knockers need the flag-burning, street-stomping antics of the extremists as evidence that their defence of the Enlightenment <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risky,</b> important business." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chinese breeders of the 21st century {{strive to}} extend the {{fighting}} season to the whole year. They advertise farm-bred [...] "designer bugs" [...] as super-fighters and agree that their technology is [...] "completely counter to the natural process". However, they refuse to use hormones or the practice of arming crickets with steel implants. As of 2003, these farm-bred crickets retailed for only around $1.50 a head, ten times lower than average wild-caught Shandong cricket. Breeding <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risky</b> business: Chinese cricket farms are regularly wiped out by an unknown disease. Fungal diseases are manageable, but crickets have no defenses against cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), which almost certainly kills the entire population. The virus was first isolated in Australia around 1970. The worst outbreak in Europe occurred in 2002. The cosmopolitan virus is carried by a multitude of invertebrate hosts, including drosophilae and honey bees, which are not affected by the disease.|$|E

The St. Johns Bridge does appear briefly, as the Ghost Bridge, conjured by a rune magic spell. In a {{question}} and answer session with Meloy and Ellis, a young reader suggested the Ghost Bridge could be interpreted as an apparition of a bridge that once existed in the past, implying that Wildwood takes place in our world's future.

2500|$|Liability issues {{strongly}} {{affect the}} structure of the diving industry, its organisation and even the implementation of recommended diving practices – and this is very much the case with buddy diving. [...] Diving <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risky</b> sport, where very serious accidents will occasionally occur. In an increasingly litigious world, accidents trigger a search for “blame”, and aspersions of blame often trigger ensuing litigation. It is a natural thing for those who may face the potential risks of litigation to take measures to mitigate these risks. [...] Diving certification agencies must necessarily insure themselves against liability risks, and must act to minimise the cost of this insurance for both themselves and their operatives. The buddy system, beneficial as it can be in enhancing diver safety, has the legal effect of [...] creating an involved intermediary person between the certifying agency and any injured party, an intermediary who could be easily identified as not having provided “duty of care” if an accident occurs. [...] This may afford a legal cushion for the agency, or trainer, or boat - but it is not exactly good news for someone acting in the role of a buddy. The more skilled the buddy partner, the more these duties of care may be assumed to increase.|$|E

The party leaders jumped {{right into the}} campaign, with Stéphane Dion attacking the Conservative's record, presenting the Liberal plan, and rejected the accusation by Harper that the Liberal party <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>risky</b> choice. Jack Layton took a more forceful approach than previous elections, in which the New Democratic Party has just tried to maintain {{a high number of}} seats in Parliament to influence government. Layton has made it clear he will campaign for the position of prime minister itself this time, but also returned to a longstanding NDP theme: alleged abuses by big business. He promised to stop what he called [...] "ripoffs" [...] by big oil, cellphone and banks, and his attacks are expected to focus on the Conservatives and all but ignore the Liberals. Elizabeth May of the Green Party said Canadians would care enough about the environment to vote for her party, as long as she was able to get into the television debates. Stephen Harper has stated his objection to including the Green Party into television debates because of the similar policies of the Green and Liberal party, and how it would be unfair. Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe said the Conservatives must be prevented from winning a majority, and the BQ is the only party that can do that. Duceppe compared Harper to US President George W. Bush, and said the government is incompetent.|$|E
