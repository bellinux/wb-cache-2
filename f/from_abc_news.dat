2500|$|In 1976, the ABC aired a {{third season}} of The Norman Gunston Show. By this stage, {{increased}} production budgets afforded Gunston {{more opportunities for}} overseas interviews, including Malcolm Muggeridge, Michael Caine, John Sturges, Glenda Jackson, John Stonehouse, and Rudolph Nureyev. One memorable encounter with Frank Zappa ended with Zappa and Norman duetting [...] respectively on guitar and harmonica in a spontaneous blues jam (McDonald {{is in fact a}} proficient harmonica player). As the jam concluded, McDonald threw in a witty musical quote <b>from</b> the well-known <b>ABC</b> <b>news</b> theme, an action which also gave a clever nod to Zappa's well-known proclivity for inserting musical quotes such as TV themes into his work.|$|R

25|$|In October 2002, Rod Young moved <b>from</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News</b> in Brisbane to co-anchor with Kay McGrath. She had {{presented}} Seven News Brisbane solo {{for the previous}} nine months following the retirement of Frank Warrick. Following a couple of lean years coming third to Nine News Brisbane and Ten Eyewitness News Brisbane, Seven News Brisbane regained its ratings lead by 2007, helped by the recruitment of ex-Nine weatherman John Schluter and director of news Rob Raschke. In 2008, Seven News Brisbane was officially the #1 bulletin in Brisbane, winning all 40 ratings weeks. As of 2013, Seven has lost its ratings lead at 6 pm to 9 pm.|$|E
500|$|On May 27,2011, Gaga {{performed}} the song on Good Morning America {{as a part}} of their [...] "Summer Concert Series". She was dressed in purple horns and a black and blond ponytail, and was placed atop a black staircase, with her leg perched on top of a black unicorn shaped piano. Dedicating the song to her mother, Gaga sang an acoustic version of [...] "Hair", which Sheila Marikar <b>from</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News</b> reviewed positively, saying that it [...] "really brought the house down." [...] Christian Blauvelt from Entertainment Weekly was also impressed with the acoustic version, saying that [...] "at a keyboard, Gaga's never better at injecting enough passion and commitment to sell even the corniest lyrics about follicular empowerment." ...|$|E
500|$|NBC had renewed Homicide for {{a second}} season to assess how the show {{performed}} in the Nielsen ratings and make a determination whether to continue the series. The series premiere, [...] "Bop Gun", drew unusually large viewership numbers due to a guest appearance by Robin Williams, but the subsequent episodes had dropped in the ratings, making the viewership of [...] "A Many Splendored Thing" [...] particularly important {{for the future of}} the series. Fontana said if the episode performed well, [...] "NBC's going to have to do some hard thinking." [...] In its original American broadcast on January 27, 1994, [...] "A Many Splendored Thing" [...] was watched by 11.2 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research, earning the episode an 11.9 rating. That constituted a slight increase from the previous week's episode, [...] "Black and Blue", which was seen by 10.83 million households. It was the 37th highest rated television show of the week, tied with the Fox animated comedy series The Simpsons. [...] "A Many Splendored Thing" [...] faced unusually tough competition in its timeslot <b>from</b> the <b>ABC</b> <b>news</b> series Primetime Live, which did a special report about convicted murderer Richard Allen Davis.|$|R
50|$|It {{also had}} the {{disadvantage}} of being produced by an outside distributor in Viacom, which meant ABC had little to no input on the program's content. The ratings never improved at all <b>from</b> <b>ABC's</b> previous efforts, and the program was canceled {{two weeks before the}} first anniversary of its premiere to be replaced by The View, a program featuring <b>ABC</b> <b>News's</b> Barbara Walters and completely under the purview of ABC itself, which has remained in the timeslot since.|$|R
50|$|On October 30, 2014, ABC {{announced}} that responsibilities for production oversight on The View would shift <b>from</b> <b>ABC's</b> daytime entertainment division to ABC News, where {{the show will}} be grouped under the division's non-fiction programming umbrella, which produces NY Med for the network as well as content for other networks including National Geographic Channel and Discovery Networks. The move in oversight will likely not generate any noticeable changes in The View's content (in recent years, the remainder of <b>ABC's</b> <b>news</b> content has become similarly slanted towards soft news, entertainment, and popular culture); it will, however, allow the show to leverage <b>ABC</b> <b>News's</b> resources more frequently than before, as well as create the possibility of making deals to land big-name guests (something generally forbidden on the newsgathering side). Walters left her role as co-executive producer {{at the end of}} the show's eighteenth season.|$|R
500|$|In contrast, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine {{described}} it as [...] "a sappy Paula Cole-style statement of self-actualization". Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone criticized its lyrics and negatively likened them to those of Alanis Morissette. Kitty Empire from The Guardian found the song to be [...] "ridden with cliché". Mesfin Fekadu <b>from</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News</b> thought both tracks were [...] "good", but stated that they [...] "could be great if Perry didn't hold back and explored more lyrically and sonically". Chris Bosman from Consequence of Sound criticized its placement on the album track listing and thought that they [...] "would stand out more if they ('By The Grace of God', and closing track 'Double Rainbow') hadn't been forced to rub elbows, thus stealing momentum and impact from each other". Carl Williott from Idolator praised the track as a [...] "nice counterpart to Roar".|$|E
500|$|An 11-segment {{series of}} reports in March 2012 <b>from</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News</b> brought {{widespread}} public attention to and raised consumer concerns about the product. The product was described as [...] "essentially scrap meat pieces compressed together and treated with an antibacterial agent". Lean finely textured beef (LFTB) {{was referred to as}} [...] "an unappetizing example of industrialized food production". The product has been characterized as [...] "unappetizing, but perhaps not more so than other things that are routinely part of hamburger" [...] by Sarah Klein, an attorney for the food safety program at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Nutritionist Andy Bellatti has referred to the product as [...] "one of many symptoms of a broken food system". Food policy writer Tom Laskawy noted that ammonium hydroxide is only one of several chemicals routinely added to industrially produced meat in the United States.|$|E
500|$|On {{behalf of}} Manawatu Standard, a {{reviewer}} complimented on the EP's production, songwriting and [...] "the right edge {{to appeal to}} a mainstream audience", saying the EP was [...] " [...] a good pop debut should be". In a review of The Love Club EP for The Dominion Post, Tom Cardy deemed the songs on the record as [...] "sharp, refreshing and smart". Additionally, he viewed the EP as the best album he had heard by a New Zealand artist that year and lauded Lorde's lyrics and performance as [...] "simply incredible". As a music reviewer for mX, Nick Mason lauded the EP as a [...] "strong" [...] debut release for displaying Lorde's maturity beyond her years, as well as impressive and inventive musical style. By the end of 2013, Allan Raible <b>from</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News</b> ranked The Love Club EP as well as Pure Heroine as the third best records of the year.|$|E

500|$|Helen Brown from The Daily Telegraph {{gave the}} album {{five out of}} five stars, stating Perry [...] "sounds like a woman, and an artist, who's finally found herself" [...] and praised the [...] "vulnerability" [...] of the album. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic, Alexis Petridis from The Guardian, and Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine all also gave the album three out of five stars. Erlewine dubbed Prism [...] "a tighter, cleaner record than its predecessors". Petridis called it [...] "Katy Perry's most spiritual album to date". Mesfin Fekadu <b>from</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News</b> deemed the tracks [...] "likable", but felt the album lacked [...] "some of the fiery fierceness and {{excitement}} that dominated Teenage Dream". James Reed from The Boston Globe felt Perry [...] "always seemed like the pop star who knows precisely what she does best" [...] and called the album [...] "an unabashedly fun listen". Chris Bosman from Consequence of Sound gave the album {{three and a half}} out of five stars, calling Perry [...] "a champion of choruses". Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune gave the album 2 out of 4 stars, commenting [...] "Though not exactly spiritual, Prism does come off as a more serious—if no less formulaic—album than its predecessor". Marah Eakin from The A.V. Club gave the album a C+, commenting [...] "A lot of Prism is simply forgettable", though praised the tracks [...] "Roar", [...] "Birthday", and [...] "This Is How We Do". Rob Harvilla from Spin gave the album a 5/10 rating, and felt some of the material was not [...] "all that desirable".|$|E
500|$|On April 20, 2010, Gaga {{performed}} the song at the MAC AIDS Fund Pan-Asia Viva Glam launch in Tokyo where {{she wore a}} doily lace dress. She entered the stage in a procession inspired by a Japanese wedding, and as the lights dimmed, she sat at her piano on the rotating stage and belted out [...] "Speechless", which {{was followed by the}} performance of [...] "Alejandro", where she was picked up by one of her dancers, who appeared to be covered in talcum powder. Gaga taped a medley of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "Alejandro" [...] for the ninth season of American Idol on April 28, 2010. Her performance aired on the show's May 5, 2010 episode. The performance started with Gaga playing the piano for a slowed-down snippet of [...] "Bad Romance". She was dressed in a revealing-but-veiled black outfit, wielding a cape and was surrounded by shirtless dancers. Halfway through the performance, she shed her cape and began writhing on the floor. Over {{in one corner of the}} stage, a statue of the Virgin Mary had flames pouring out of the top of it, as Gaga sang the chorus. Fog filled the stage, as Gaga and her dancers performed an energetic dance routine. Luchina Fisher <b>from</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News</b> called it a [...] "thinly-veiled performance dripping with sex and violins" [...] and [...] "Gaga doing her best Madonna impression." [...] On July 9, 2010, the song was performed on The Today Show, where she sang it on a stage, outside the studio. In May 2011, Gaga {{performed the}} song during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria.|$|E

2500|$|According to Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, the {{hamburger}}, {{a ground}} meat patty between {{two slices of}} bread, was first created in America in 1900 by Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant, owner of Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut. There have been rival claims by Charlie Nagreen, Frank and Charles Menches, Oscar Weber Bilby, and Fletcher Davis. White Castle traces {{the origin of the}} hamburger to Hamburg, Germany with its invention by Otto Kuase. However, it gained national recognition at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair when the New York Tribune referred to the hamburger as [...] "the innovation of a food vendor on the pike". No conclusive argument has ever ended the dispute over invention. An article <b>from</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News</b> sums up: [...] "One problem is that there is little written history. Another issue is that the spread of the burger happened largely at the World's Fair, from tiny vendors that came and went in an instant. And it is entirely possible that more than one person {{came up with the idea}} at the same time in different parts of the country." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 22, 2014, Beyoncé {{confirmed}} the air {{date of the}} special to be September 20, 2014, on her official Facebook page, along with another short video trailer. HBO used 20 different cameras to record the two shows and various special effect were later used, such as slow motion, quick cuts and aerial views.

The trailer began with Beyoncé dressed as a jazz singer staring down a captive Jay-Z in the audience, whilst singing Nancy Sinatra's cover version of [...] "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)". The trailer then cuts to footage of live performances from the On the Run Tour, featuring Beyoncé and Jay-Z interacting.

2500|$|WFAA {{launched}} a digital subchannel on virtual channel 8.2 in 2004, as a locally programmed format {{under the name}} [...] "Xpress 8.2". The service, which was later renamed [...] "News 8 Now" [...] (which the station also used as the branding for promotional content and as an alternative program-specific title for the station's newscasts starting in 1996), featured weather radar imagery, regular news updates and occasional live programming (including content <b>from</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News</b> Now), {{as well as a}} ticker that displayed local and national headlines. The subchannel was also used to air special programming; in particular, WFAA-DT2 was used to relay wall-to-wall coverage from its sister stations during hurricane season from New Orleans sister station WWL-TV for Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 and Hurricane Gustav in 2008; and Houston sister station KHOU for Hurricane Ike in 2008 and Hurricane Harvey in 2017. In addition to the weather radar feed, it also carried an audio simulcast of local NOAA Weather Radio station KEC56, with fellow NOAA stations KEC55 in Fort Worth and KXI87 in Corsicana used as alternate feeds. On April 30, 2011, the subchannel became an affiliate of The Local AccuWeather Channel. In really rare times, this channel space will be used to air pre-empted ABC programming due to a live sporting event such as Monday Night Football when the Dallas Cowboys are scheduled to play.|$|E
