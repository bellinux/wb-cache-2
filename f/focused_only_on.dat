5|$|Wisemore's {{character}} introduces {{feelings about}} the London community and criticises various problems. However, his reflections are portrayed as both correct and lacking, {{and that he is}} <b>focused</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> the bad aspects of life. His ideas result from removing himself from society in preference to the company of classical books. Although he does not realise it, the play suggests that there are virtuous people. Merital, in response to Wisemore, believes that Wisemore's philosophical inclinations are foolish. As the play later reveals, Wisemore's views are only a mask to hide from his own feelings and views on love.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of Him {{originally}} {{stemmed from}} an idea developed at a game jam called the Ludum Dare. The game originally had players removing objects while {{the main character}} {{became more and more}} depressed. Mata Haggis, one of the developers of Fragments of Him, told the Rock, Paper, Shotgun blog that in the final version there would be more mechanics than just removing objects. He said that there would be some choices to be made, and that the story would branch off a little from the choices. The prototype of the game <b>focused</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> the boyfriend, while the full version was to include four different character perspectives. He described the gameplay style as a mix of Heavy Rain and Gone Home. Haggis told Nathan Grayson of the Kotaku blog that many of the objects in the game, such as hotels and parks, were based on his real-life experiences of when he lost a friend.|$|E
5|$|Capcom's design {{philosophy}} for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was {{to maximize}} gameplay depth and minimize complexity. According to Niitsuma, the development team sought {{to create a}} game that would reach out to longtime fans of the series, while simultaneously expanding their user base to those familiar with the characters, but perhaps not with fighting games in general. The urge {{to reach out to}} new players also stemmed from Marvel's recent success in the Hollywood film industry. Capcom's global head of production, Keiji Inafune, expressed interest in appealing to a worldwide audience. These ideas drove the decision to retool the fighting system, which was criticized in past iterations for being too complicated for casual players. These changes include the implementation of the three-button attack system from Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and the addition of Simple Mode. Unlike previous titles in the series, Capcom had no plans for an arcade release, and <b>focused</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> console versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. When asked if Capcom was planning to release the game on other consoles, Niitsuma did not dismiss the possibility for a Nintendo Wii version; however, this ultimately did not come to fruition.|$|E

5|$|Hata's major {{contribution}} to Nanking Massacre studies is his book Nankin jiken ("The Nanking Incident"), published in 1986, {{which is a}} detailed study of the event based on Japanese, Chinese, and English sources that was later noted by historians such as Daqing Yang {{to be one of}} the few impartial works of scholarship written on the massacre during the period. The book is known for its relatively low estimate of the death toll, which Hata put at up to 40,000 because he based the number of civilian killing on the work of Lewis S.C. Smythe who conducted survey of massacre in the immediate aftermass (War Damage in Nanking Area, Dec.1937 to March 1938, Urban and Rural Surveys) and also exclude Chinese soldiers. Hata's book is acknowledged as the first to discuss what might have caused the massacre, whereas previous books had <b>focused</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> the event itself. Hata argued that the Japanese Army's lack of military police and facilities to detain POWs, its ignorance of international laws, and the Chinese General Tang Shengzhi's decision to flee the city without formally surrendering, which left large number of plain-clothes soldiers within the civilian population which was followed by excessive mopping-up operations by the Japanese, among the factors which led to the slaughter.|$|E

Nimetz noted that he did not present any new proposals, thanked the United States with whom he said he was in contact, and urged more countries to help in solving the dispute. He also announced that he was more optimistic after this meeting, and that he <b>focused</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> the solutions that could be applied by NATO's summit in April.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 27 June 1994, the cult carried out a {{chemical}} weapons attack against civilians when they released sarin in the central Japanese city of Matsumoto, Nagano. With {{the help of a}} converted refrigerator truck, members of the cult released a cloud of sarin which floated near the homes of judges who were overseeing a lawsuit concerning a real-estate dispute which was predicted to go against the cult. This Matsumoto incident killed eight and harmed 500 more. Police investigations <b>focused</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> an innocent local resident, Yoshiyuki Kouno, and failed to implicate the cult at the time. It was only after the Tokyo subway attack that Aum Shinrikyo was discovered to be behind the Matsumoto sarin attack.|$|E
25|$|Business slumped with General Motors {{after the}} second {{sponsorship}} deal ended for World of Motion in 1992, and as a result, GM started signing 1-year contracts for the ride. However, a suggested idea to gut the building {{and turn it into}} a new attraction stuck with Disney representatives and GM businessmen. It would take World of Motion, close it down, and refurbish it into a new ride that <b>focused</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> cars. Thus, World of Motion was shut down to the public while a new attraction, called Test Track, was taking its place. Scheduled to open 19 months after World of Motion's closing, this new ride would put guests in a test car against vehicle tests that were needed to deem the car safe for road travel.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1956 break-up, the Bell System {{included}} the companies listed below, plus those {{listed in the}} pre-1984 section. Northern Electric, and the Caribbean regional operating companies were {{considered part of the}} Bell System proper before the 1956 break-up. Nippon Electric was considered a more distant affiliate of Western Electric than Northern Electric, where Nippon Electric via its own research and development adapted the designs of Western Electric's North American telecommunications equipment for use in Japan, which to this day gives much of Japan's telephone equipment and network a closer resemblance to North American ANSI and Telcordia standards than to European-originated ITU-T standards. Before the 1956 break-up, Northern Electric was predominantly <b>focused</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> manufacturing, without any significant amount of telecommunication-equipment research & development of its own. The post-World War II-occupation operation of Japan's NTT was considered an administrative adjunct to the North American Bell System.|$|E
25|$|On {{the last}} ascent of the day, the Tre Cime di Lavaredo, Di Luca made {{up much of}} the ground he had in deficit to Mazzoleni on the road, conceding a minute and 24 seconds {{to him at the}} finish line. Gilberto Simoni, Damiano Cunego, and Andy Schleck {{finished}} just behind him. In the front of the race, Riccò attacked as the Lavaredo climb began and quickly got a 15 second gap. The only rider to bridge to him was his teammate Piepoli. Piepoli, having taken the lead outright in the mountains classification, allowed Riccò the stage win. Their team leader Simoni reflected after the stage that he thought their early break was foolhardy, and that he had not followed because he was <b>focused</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> the overall and not stages, but that he was happy that the team took the Giro's marquee stage.|$|E
25|$|For Black Ops, Treyarch <b>focused</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> {{this game}} unlike past practice. However, it had {{different}} teams, each working on separate game modes. Treyarch used a motion capture technology {{similar to the}} one used in James Cameron's film Avatar, which allows accurate facial expressions, capturing the whole performance of the actor. The studio also consulted special forces veterans from both belligerents of the Cold War: Major John Plaster (US Army-Ret.) who served in the MACV-SOG during the Vietnam War, and former Soviet special forces operative Sonny Puzikas. The latter taught Treyarch how Spetsnaz soldiers would react in combat, such as rolling out of the line of fire. Spetsnaz AIs in the game have been modeled after him, from his tactics and his movements to his face. Although having a historical background, the classified aspect of these Cold War black operations allowed the studio to create its own fictional story. The game also allows players to turn down the blood and turn off the profanity.|$|E

25|$|The best-known {{representative}} of the Bohemian Reformation is Jan Hus. He was an influential university teacher and a popular preacher in Bethlehem Chapel in the Old Town of Prague. The chapel was founded already in 1391 {{in the spirit of}} the nascent Bohemian Reformation. It was intended solely for sermons in the Czech language and it could admit 3,000 people. Jan Hus and his friends (e. g. Jacob of Mies) were skeptical about the idea of conciliarism which called for a church reform from above via cardinals and theologians. For them the cardinals and theologians were bearers of the same corruption as the papacy itself. Hus believed that the head of the Church was Jesus Christ rather than the pope. In some issues they were inspired by the ideas of an Oxford theologian and philosopher John Wycliffe. It can be seen in their cooperation with the secular power which supported them. Together with Wycliffe they thought that aristocracy could help the church to become poor and <b>focused</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> spiritual issues by confiscation of its property. In 1412 Jan Hus criticized selling indulgences which led to an unrest in Prague suppressed by the city council.|$|E

At a campaign event, Biden commented, [...] "I {{know a lot of}} my opponents out there say I'd be a great secretary of state. Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates? 'Joe's right, Joe's right, Joe's right.'" [...] Other candidates commenting that [...] "Joe is right" [...] in the Democratic debates has been converted into a Biden campaign theme and ad.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} the Dyson sphere {{was the result of}} a thought {{experiment}} by physicist and mathematician Freeman Dyson, when he theorized that all technological civilizations constantly increased their demand for energy. He reasoned that if human civilization expanded energy demands long enough, there would come a time when it demanded the total energy output of the Sun. He proposed a system of orbiting structures (which he referred to initially as a shell) designed to intercept and collect all energy produced by the Sun. Dyson's proposal did not detail how such a system would be constructed, but <b>focused</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> issues of energy collection, on the basis that such a structure could be distinguished by its unusual emission spectrum in comparison to a star. His 1960 paper [...] "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation", published in the journal Science, is credited with being the first to formalize the {{concept of the}} Dyson sphere.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{started his}} {{education}} focusing on speech and language and published papers on these topics, focusing on mathematical, computational and psychological {{aspects of the}} field. He started his career {{at a time when}} the reigning theory in psychology was behaviorism, which eschewed any attempt to study mental processes and <b>focused</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> observable behavior. Working mostly at Harvard University, MIT and Princeton University, Miller introduced experimental techniques to study the psychology of mental processes. [...] He went on to be one of the founders of psycholinguistics and was then one of the key figures in founding the broader new field of cognitive science, circa 1978. He collaborated and co-authored work with other figures in cognitive science and psycholinguistics, such as Noam Chomsky. For moving psychology into the realm of mental processes and for aligning that move with information theory, computation theory, and linguistics, Miller is considered one of the great twentieth-century psychologists. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Miller as the 20th most cited psychologist of that era.|$|E
500|$|After the deployment, {{the issues}} of {{appropriate}} service conditions, awards and recognition took many years to resolve. After serving the required 90-day period, contingent members were entitled to the Australian Service Medal (ASM) for non-warlike service. About 12 years after their return to Australia, the government changed {{the status of the}} operation; contingent members were eligible for the Returned from Active Service Badge, and their ASMs were upgraded to the Australian Active Service Medal (AASM). After the 2002 decision Major Nigel Catchlove wrote to the Army newspaper, calling it a [...] "pointless upgrade" [...] and saying it [...] "detracts from the award of the AASM to those who truly deserve it". In his letter, Catchlove compared the UNTAG operation to two subsequent operations: the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment deployment to Somalia during Operation Solace and the deployment of service personnel as part of the International Force for East Timor: [...] "both of those operations involved robust rules of engagement appropriate to the intervention of forces in UN-sanctioned, US or Australian-led multi-national coalitions. UNTAG by way of contrast was a classic peacekeeping operation led by the UN in a relatively benign environment where rules of engagement were <b>focused</b> <b>only</b> <b>on</b> force protection". Catchlove questioned the [...] "half-hearted approach to implementing this appalling decision" [...] in which eligible people must apply for the upgrade, saying this [...] "failed the test of commonsense".|$|E
