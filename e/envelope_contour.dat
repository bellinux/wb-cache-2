5000|$|ARP Instruments {{introduced}} {{an updated version}} of the Omni as the Omni-2 in 1978. The Omni-2 utilized an all-steel chassis with ARP's orange and black color scheme and an updated Chorus Phaser circuit which ARP claimed to be superior to that of the original Omni. Additionally, the Omni-2's Bass voice utilized a single oscillator waveform circuit coupled with a preset 2-pole, Low Pass Filter and preset Attack Decay Release (ADR) envelope generator. A Staccato switch controlled the Bass section's <b>envelope</b> <b>contour</b> Decay time vs. the original Omni Bass voice ADSR assignment via its Synthesizer section. Further, the Omni-2 Bass section had its own audio output on the rear panel in addition to the Strings and Synthesizer outputs; separate amplification of these three distinct outputs was referred to in ARP literature at the time as [...] "Tri-phonic". The Omni-2 also featured selectable Single- or Multiple-Trigger keyboard control of envelope contours and re-branded the original Waveform Enhancement panel control switch as [...] "Hollow Waveform".|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the limited}} number of {{cochlear}} implantees speaking Mandarin Chinese, it is extremely difficult to evaluate new speech coding algorithms designed for tonal languages. Access to an intelligibility index that could reliably predict the intelligibility of vocoded (and non-vocoded) Mandarin Chinese is a viable solution to address this challenge. The speech-transmission index (STI) and coherence-based intelligibility measures, among others, have been examined extensively for predicting the intelligibility of English speech but have not been evaluated for vocoded or wideband (non-vocoded) Mandarin speech despite the perceptual differences between the two languages. The results indicated that the coherence-based measures seem to be influenced by the characteristics of the spoken language. The highest correlation (r= 0. 91 – 0. 97) was obtained in Mandarin Chinese with a weighted coherence measure that included primarily information from high-intensity voiced segments (e. g., vowels) containing F 0 information, known to be important for lexical tone recognition. In contrast, in English, highest correlation was obtained with a coherence measure that included information from weak consonants and vowel∕consonant transitions. A band-importance function was proposed that captured information about the amplitude <b>envelope</b> <b>contour.</b> A higher modulation rate (100 Hz) was found necessary for the STI-based measures for maximum correlation (r[*]=[*] 0. 94 – 0. 96) with vocoded Mandarin and English recognition...|$|E
40|$|Skirted {{foundations}} {{have been}} widely applied as offshore foundations for several decades. In design, the use of failure envelopes is convenient for assessing stability under combined loading. A large number of studies on failure envelopes {{exist in the literature}} based on experiments and numerical analyses. Most of these studies focus on ultimate capacity and static loading. This paper presents a numerical study focusing on cyclic degradation and failure envelopes for skirted foundations subjected to combined cyclic and static loading. It was found that the shapes of the failure envelopes are little affected by degradation expressed by the number of equivalent cycles. In addition to failure <b>envelopes,</b> <b>contours</b> of displacements were computed in the three-dimensional load space (vertical, horizontal and moment load) for a more complete description of the response. As an example, the well-defined cyclic contour diagrams of Drammen clay were utilised to demonstrate how foundation response diagrams can be established. The database is accompanied by a simplified procedure to account for cyclic degradation through equivalent number of cycles, different normalised load–displacement response and variation in foundation geometry. The framework of procedures can be used to estimate foundation stiffness and capacity and the results can serve as a basis for the development of foundation macro-element models...|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{laboratory}} testing {{is the main}} tool currently used to characterise soil behaviour under cyclic loading and inform offshore foundation design. Laboratory tests, such as cyclic direct simple shear tests, are used to compile contour diagrams of cyclic shear strain or pore pressure from which the effect of cyclic loading is assessed based on an accumulation procedure. In this study, a practical reference for design purposes {{is presented in the}} form of a contour diagram of maximum shear strain for normally consolidated kaolin clay under symmetrical cyclic loading. The paper also attempts to define the mode of failure of normally consolidated kaolin under cyclic loading based on a series of symmetrical and non-symmetrical cyclic direct simple shear tests and the shear strain failure criterion plotted as a failure <b>envelope</b> on <b>contour</b> diagrams. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} multi-material virtual {{prototyping}} (MMVP) system that integrates the virtual reality (VR) and the layered manufacturing (LM) technologies for digital fabrication of heterogeneous multi-material prototypes for advanced product development and biomedical engineering. The system consists mainly of two algorithms for sequential and concurrent multitoolpath planning, and a virtual prototyping system. The algorithms adopt a topological hierarchysorting algorithm {{to establish the}} hierarchy relationship of multi-material slice contours for facilitating toolpath planning of multi-material layered manufacturing (MMLM). Subsequently, the sequential multi-toolpath planning algorithm generates sequential toolpaths that avoid redundant tool movements. To reduce build time further, the concurrent multi-toolpath planning algorithm generates collision-free concurrent toolpaths. Based on the hierarchy information, a bounding box can be adopted to approximate <b>envelopes</b> of <b>contour</b> families of the same material property to simplify detection of tool collisions. The algorithms are integrated to form the MMVP system for planning, stereoscopic simulation, and validation of multi-toolpaths for MMLM. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of fully automatic GMAW processes may {{rely on the}} development of sophisticated equipment to emulate the manual welding torch oscillation pattern or {{on the development of}} high level methods of control to prevent the appearance of defects, especially the lack of sidewall fusion. An intermediate solution is to optimise the weaving parameters of a conventional pattern oscillator {{in such a way as}} to minimise the level of rejection. A prototype of a computerised system to work with Pulsed-GMAW equipment, in the vertical-up position, was proposed to produce a minimal level of rejection for welds in plates up to 25 mm thick. The system basically consists of optimised mode control algorithms, based on theoretical and experimental models of weld pool behaviour. Three tasks are performed by the system; the selection of parameters for an optimum working point, an off-line simulation of the operation and real-time error monitoring of the process. Statistical experimental modelling was applied in order to build most of the optimised models, because of the large number of variables to be treated and their complex inter-correlation. The welding variables were correlated with single responses. Partial and Correlation Analysis techniques were used to discover the relationship between the variables and the responses. Regression Analysis was then applied as a means of obtaining the 'weight' of the most significant variables. Finally, since some variables were found to be collinear, a corrective technique for biased variables was employed. Acceptance criteria for bead shapes were proposed and assessed. The effect of the oscillation parameters and other welding variables on the bead formation was analyzed and an operational 'envelope' for the parameters determined. A theoretical approach to predict the occurrence of poorly shaped beads, due to the lack of metal bridge between the joint walls, was successfully developed and applied in parallel with the statistical experimental methods. Equations for optimising the bead shape and for determining the operational <b>envelope</b> <b>contours</b> were subsequently generated and evaluated. An extension of the system to an actual adaptive control scheme was discussed and sensors and signals to be used were evaluated. Finally, a process instability phenomenon in long test plates was identified and investigated. This instability may prevent the use of GMA W in some conditions in the vertical-up position...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} topological hierarchy-based {{approach}} to toolpath planning for multi-material layered manufacturing (MMLM) of heterogeneous prototypes. The approach facilitates control of MMLM {{and increases the}} fabrication efficiency of complex objects by generating multi-toolpaths that avoid redundant tool movements and potential collisions. It uses a topological hierarchy-sorting algorithm to group complex multi-material slice contours into families connected by a parent-and-child relationship. Subsequently, a sequential toolpath planning algorithm generates multi-toolpaths for sequential deposition of materials without redundant tool movements. To reduce build time further, a concurrent toolpath planning algorithm generates collision-free multi-toolpaths to control the tools that deposit materials concurrently. It uses parametric polygons to construct tool <b>envelopes</b> for <b>contour</b> families of the same material property to simplify detection of tool collisions. The tightness of polygons can be controlled to suit the processing speed and the optimality of the resulting concurrent toolpaths. The proposed approach has been implemented {{as an integral part}} of a multi-material virtual prototyping (MMVP) system that can process complex slice contours for planning, stereoscopic simulation, and validation of multi-toolpaths. It may be adapted for subsequent control of MMLM processes. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{frontier}} of a curved surface is the <b>envelope</b> of <b>contour</b> generators showing the boundary, at least locally, {{of the visible}} region swept out under viewer motion. In general, the outlines of curved surfaces (apparent contours) from different viewpoints are generated by different contour generators {{on the surface and}} hence do not provide a constraint on viewer motion. Frontier points, however, have projections which correspond to a real point on the surface and can be used to constrain viewer motion by the epipolar constraint. We show how to recover viewer motion from frontier points and generalise the ordinary epipolar constraint to deal with points, curves and apparent contours of surfaces. This is done for both continuous and discrete motion, known or unknown orientation, calibrated and uncalibrated, perspective, weak perspective and orthographic cameras. Results of an iterative scheme to recover the epipolar line structure from real image sequences using only the outlines of curved surfaces, is presented. A statistical evaluation is performed to estimate the stability of the solution. It is also shown how the full motion of the camera from a sequence of images can be obtained from the relative motion between image pairs...|$|R
40|$|For the {{mechanism}} with rotating cam and knife-edge follower, an optimization criterion {{by means of}} imposed constraints upon cam’s curvature is expressed in a special coordinate system. Thus, stating the optimization criterion in the coordinate system defined by {{the mechanism}}s constructive parameters -eccentricity and minimum follower’s stroke, a contour is obtained for any position of the mechanism. The optimization criterion assumes establishing {{the position of the}} characteristic point of the mechanism with respect to this contour. Fulfillment of optimization criterion assumes that the characteristic point is positioned in the same manner with respect to all contours. The optimization criterion is simplified when considering the <b>envelope</b> of the <b>contours.</b> The method is exemplified using two mechanisms, with the cams priori satisfying the criterion...|$|R
40|$|Electron {{microscopy}} of disrupted Escherichia coli cells {{under certain}} conditions revealed loops of a fiber 120 A in diameter which were attached to the cell envelope and showed a 130 A repeating beaded substructure. These fibers were detected only when the cells were lysed in 0. 15 M NaCl solutions directly on the electron microscope supporting films and if the dehydration steps began within 2 min of lysis. Under these conditions examination of cells lysogenic for phage lambda after superinfection with lambda wild type or deletion mutants disclosed short loops of a 120 A diameter fiber free of the cell <b>envelope.</b> Because the <b>contour</b> length of these loops was proportionate to the DNA content of the superinfecting lambda phage, {{it was concluded that}} the fibers contained DNA condensed 6. 5 -fold in blocks of about 250 base pairs...|$|R
40|$|Singularities of {{the joint}} density of states (JDOS) and Fourier-transformed local density of states (FT-LDOS) {{correspond}} to the hot spots in quasiparticle interference patterns. In this paper the singularity of JDOS is analyzed exactly, with three types of singularities being classified. In particular, the third type of singularities are found exactly to be <b>envelopes</b> of the <b>contours</b> of constant energy. Remarkably, we show that JDOS and FT-LDOS have the same singular points. Approaching to the singular points, both quantities diverge complementarily in an inverse-square-root manner if the joint curvature is nonzero. The relative magnitude of divergence is governed by the joint curvature {{as well as the}} product of the quasiparticle velocities. If the joint curvature of certain singularity is zero, the divergence has a higher order than - 1 / 2. Comment: 7 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

Computations were performed using a modification of the unsteady NASA Ames viscous code, ROTOR 1, and an improved version of the NASA Lewis steady inviscid cascade system MERIDL-TSONIC coupled with boundary layer codes BLAYER and STAN 5. Two different turbine stages were analyzed: {{the first stage of}} the United Technologies Research Center Large Scale Rotating Rig (LSRR) and the first stage of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) high pressure fuel turbopump turbine. The time-averaged airfoil midspan pressure and heat transfer profiles were predicted for numerous thermal boundary conditions including adiabatic wall, prescribed surface temperature, and prescribed heat flux. Computed solutions are compared {{with each other and with}} experimental data in the case of the LSRR calculations.

40|$|One way to {{understand}} the relationship between speech perception and production is to examine cases where the two dissociate. This study investigates the hypothesis that perceptual acuity reflected in event-related potentials (ERPs) to rise time of sound amplitude <b>envelope</b> and pitch <b>contour</b> (reflected in the mismatch negativity, MMN) may associate with individual differences in production among speakers with otherwise comparable perceptual abilities. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of an on-going sound change – tone merging in Cantonese, and compared the ERPs between two groups of typically-developed native speakers who could discriminate the high rising and low rising tones with equivalent accuracy but differed in the distinctiveness of their production of these tones. Using a passive oddball paradigm, early positive-going EEG components to rise time and MMN to pitch contour were elicited during perception of the two tones. Significant group differences were found in neural responses to rise time rather than pitch contour. More importantly, individual differences in efficiency of tone discrimination in response latency and magnitude of neural responses to rise time were correlated with acoustic measures of F 0 offset and rise time differences in productions of the two rising tones. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|In a consumerist driven culture, crime interweaves {{within the}} {{everyday}} fabric of leisurely {{consumption of the}} filmic artefact, as a culturally constructed entertainment commodity that contours our understandings of the female penal subject and the closed world of the prison – performatively enacted on the visual screen. It is important to investigate popular cultural mediums such as film, because the epistemology created from mediated representations reaches a far greater audience than that generated from academic criminological research endeavours. The dissertation is a critical, analytical, deconstructive inquiry into the cinematic constructions of the lawbreaker/prisoner, across three diverse and interlocking film-making forms: exploitation, Hollywood, and contemporary independent. A feminist-grounded theory methodology {{was employed to examine}} a historized database of 22 titles within a complexly integrative framework that unveiled a profusion of prisoners’ subjectivities (categorical constructions); emergent within varied manifestations of the prison and themes (criminological and otherwise), and affirmed in enveloping discourses and theoretical constructs. A multi-analytical, interrogative focus of single filmic texts emphasized particular areas, including the micro-aspects of textual aesthetic expressions (visual, dialogical, narratological, performative and thematic), the meso-milieu of ethnographic ‘voices’ of film industry personnel and the broader macro-level domains (historical, socio-political, cultural and criminological) that <b>envelope</b> and <b>contour</b> the film-making process. Cyberspace supplementary textual sources included 1, 161 film reviews. The dissertation findings reveal that prisoners are multiply-constituted subjects; intersectionally located, contextually specific and situated in unequal relations of power. Across the mediascape of women-in-prison titles, the delineated film-making forms create varied and recycled subjectivities; from the fantastical, clichéd ‘othered’ archetypes in exploitation cinema, to the fictitiously personified, ‘normative’ womanhood in Hollywoodized tales. Conversely, the independent film symbolizes a critical image practice of resistance that creates alternatively distinctive, empowering embodiments of prisoners which not only reflect contextualized moments of authenticity in prisoners’ marginalized, experiential lives, but which serve also to demystify the corrosive, oppressive and seemingly denaturalized subjectivities found in the former filmic forms. The praxological research outcomes aim to encourage the filmic viewer to consume representations with a more critical cinephilic eye that challenges problematic representations which appear to reflect an existing unquestioned, taken-for-granted reality regarding the penal subject...|$|R
30|$|Considering the {{sufficient}} {{sampling of}} Na+ ions within the SF in the equilibrium simulation, we recorded positions of all valid Na+ ions (staying in the SF {{for at least}} 1 ns) and then generated the 3 D probability density map for these positions (Fig.  1 E). To facilitate visualization, contour envelops covering 90 %, 80 %, 70 % and 60 % of the density points were presented along with the cryo-EM structure of NaVPaS. As shown in Figure  1 F, with the decrease of included density points, the contour envelop shifts gradually towards D and E in the DEKA loci, which strongly indicates that Na+ ions prefer to enter the SF of NaVPaS in an asymmetric manner (along the side wall near D and E). As a control, we simulated the Na+ permeation in a prokaryotic NaV channel, NaVRh, and produced the ion density map following the same protocol. Notably, NaVRh presents a homotetrameric architecture with four Ser residues (SSSS) at the constriction site of the SF and four Glu residues (EEEE) {{at the entrance to}} the SF. Despite the reported tiny structural asymmetry, <b>contour</b> <b>envelopes</b> of the probability density map are always distributed around the central axis of the pore (Fig.  1 G). Therefore, Na+ ions are likely to have remarkably different permeation behaviors in prokaryotic and eukaryotic NaV channels, and simulations on eukaryotic channels such as NaVPaS may provide more valuable insights to the mechanism of NaV channels in higher organisms.|$|R
40|$|Origin of {{hydrodynamic}} turbulence in rotating shear flows is investigated. The {{particular emphasis}} is on flows whose angular velocities decrease but specific angular momenta increase with increasing radial coordinate. Such flows are Rayleigh stable, but must be turbulent in order to explain observed data. Such a mismatch between the linear theory and observations/experiments is more severe when any hydromagnetic/magnetohydrodynamic instability and the corresponding turbulence therein is ruled out. The present work explores the effect of stochastic noise on such hydrodynamic flows. We focus on a small section of such a flow which is essentially a plane shear flow supplemented by the Coriolis effect. This also mimics a small section of an astrophysical accretion disk. It is found that such stochastically driven flows exhibit large temporal and spatial correlations of perturbation velocities, and hence large energy dissipations, that presumably generate instability. A range of angular velocity profiles (for the steady flow), starting with the constant angular momentum {{to that of the}} constant circular velocity are explored. It is shown that the growth and roughness exponents calculated from the <b>contour</b> (<b>envelope)</b> of the perturbed flows are all identical, revealing a unique universality class for the stochastically forced hydrodynamics of rotating shear flows. This work, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, is the first attempt to understand origin of instability and turbulence in the three-dimensional Rayleigh stable rotating shear flows by introducing additive stochastic noise to the underlying linearized governing equations. This has important implications in resolving the turbulence problem in astrophysical hydrodynamic flows such as accretion disks...|$|R
40|$|The {{discontinuities}} of phase-shifted abutting line gratings {{give rise}} to perception of an "illusory contour" (IC) along the line terminations. Neuronal responses to such ICs have been interpreted as evidence for a specialized visual mechanism, since such responses cannot be predicted from conventional linear receptive fields. However, when the spatial scale of the component gratings (carriers) is large compared to the neuron's luminance passband, these IC responses might be evoked simply by the luminance edges at the line terminations. Thus by presenting abutting gratings at a series of carrier spatial scales to cat A 18 neurons, {{we were able to}} distinguish genuine nonlinear responses from those due to luminance edges. Around half of the neurons (both simple and complex types) showed a bimodal response pattern to abutting gratings: one peak at a low carrier spatial frequency range that overlapped with the luminance passband, and a second distinct peak at much higher frequencies beyond the neuron's grating resolution. For those bimodally responding neurons, the low-frequency responses were sensitive to carrier phase, but the high-frequency responses were phase-invariant. Thus the responses at low carrier spatial frequencies could be understood via a linear model, while the higher frequency responses represented genuine nonlinear IC processing. IC responsive neurons also demonstrated somewhat lower spatial preference to the periodic <b>contours</b> (<b>envelopes)</b> compared to gratings, but the optimal orientation and motion direction for both were quite similar. The nonlinear responses to ICs could be explained by the same energy mechanism underlying responses to second-order stimuli such as contrast-modulated gratings. Similar neuronal preferences for ICs and for gratings may contribute to the form-cue invariant perception of moving contours. Copyright © 2006 Cambridge ++University Press...|$|R
30|$|In this work, when {{analyzing}} the probability density map of Na+ ions, we identified only one long and continuous curve that {{passes through the}} SF (Fig.  2 A), which should correspond to the most probable ion permeation path. Besides strength, our ridge detection algorithm also reported a width for each ridge point (see Supplementary Materials for details), which depicts the ion positional fluctuation in the direction perpendicular to the path. As shown in Figure S 6, <b>contour</b> <b>envelopes</b> covering 90 %, 80 %, 70 % and 60 % of the density points are all distributed around the ridge, which supports the “most probable” property of the identified path. As shown in Movie S 1, when permeating along the identified path, Na+ ions have to pass through D (Asp 375) and E (Glu 701) in the DEKA region. Notably, a highly conserved acidic residue, Glu 704 in repeat II, is also located around the path and is actively involved in ion coordination. We {{want to emphasize that}} the most probable ion permeation path identified here is unlikely to locate using conventional simulation methods. In the simulation of prokaryotic NaV channels, the structural symmetry of these channels allows people to simply use the vertical axis to roughly describe the ion permeation events. Such simple approaches become powerless in the analysis of NaVPaS, where the ions clearly enter the SF in an asymmetric manner. Moreover, the string method with swarms of trajectories (Pan et al., 2008), which is frequently used in locating the minimum free energy reaction paths through swarms of iterative simulations, requires that the termini of the path should be energetically stable. However, the termini of the ion permeation path belong to the aqueous extracellular space and the central cavity, both of which lack stable ion binding positions. Therefore, the combination of 3 D ridge detection and equilibrium simulations as developed in this work successfully overcomes the deficiency of previous methods and would thus become an effective approach in the analysis of ion permeation behaviors in eukaryotic NaV channels.|$|R
