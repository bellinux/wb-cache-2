40|$|Smackover Field, {{discovered}} in 1922, {{is an excellent}} example of the methodology of heavy oil handling and loss in early 20 th century flush production fields. Emulsion problems and waste were severe; millions of barrels of heavy oil were stored in earthen pits for up to a decade, and millions of barrels of oil were lost to land and water. The largest quantity of crude oil waste was from the inadequate handling and treatment of water-in-oil emulsions. Crude oil loss was also associated with earthen storage both on leases and in large tank farms. Lease storage pits served numerous purposes and had the most complex fluid his-tory. Many were used for decades as saltwater disposal pits fol-lowing the <b>flush</b> <b>oil</b> period. Large earthen tank farms on the field edge stored millions of barrels of heavy oil in the 1920 s and 1930 s but were not used for saltwater storage. Today the farms exist within young forests where the ground is hardened by as-phaltic deposits associated with both earthen construction and seepage loss. Drainage areas also provide a record of the exten-sive waste oil history. Asphaltic layers are most prominent in creek areas that did not burn, but degraded oil exists to some ex-tent in almost all field drainage areas...|$|R
40|$|Time-lapse seismic {{can be an}} {{important}} tool for monitoring and planing further development of a producing hydrocarbon field. Use of 4 D seismic can make itpossible to detect production changes over a relatively large area and match thesechanges with production data acquired from wells. Undepleted pockets, pressurebarriers and injectors out of range can be revealed when interpreting a 4 D data set. This can be valuable information when updating reservoir models and when planingnew wells an hence, lead to an increased recovery from the field. The reservoir interval and the oil column in the Norne G-segment are relatively thin. The pore pressure in the segment has been in the range of the bubble point of thehydrocarbons in place. This has led to gas going out of solution and back to oil againas a result of variations in pore pressure. The producer 6608 / 10 -E- 4 has extractedthe hydrocarbons from the segment while injector 6608 / 10 -F- 4 has given pressuresupport to the producer by injection of water down flank in the water zone. Waterhas <b>flushed</b> <b>oil</b> {{as a result of the}} production of the hydrocarbons and injection ofwater. All this factors introduces more than one effect that may have affected theseismic response form the field at the same time, making the 4 D interpretation inthis segment challenging. In this Master?s thesis interpretation of pressure and saturation changes in the NorneG-segment have been performed for the time interval between 2001 and 2006. Thework is done by use of amplitude difference data and AVO attributes on the seismichorizon representing top reservoir in addition to time shift analysis on a horizon belowthe reservoir.

This range is sufficient to give results for different experiments.|$|R

40|$|The Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} {{threatened}} many coastal ecosystems in the Gulf of Mexico {{during the spring}} and summer of 2010. Mitigation strategies included the construction of barrier sand berms, the restriction or blocking of inlets, and the diversion of freshwater from rivers to the coastal marshes and into the ocean, in order to <b>flush</b> away the <b>oil,</b> on the premise that these measures could reduce the quantity of oil reaching sensitive coastal environments such as wetlands or estuaries. These projects result in changes to the ecosystems that they were intended to protect. Long-term effects include alterations of the hydrological and ecological characteristics of estuaries, changes in sediment transport along the coastal barrier islands, the loss of sand resources, and adverse impacts to benthic and pelagic organisms.

30|$|Fundamentally, CO 2 -EOR {{operates}} {{in a simple}} manner. Given the right conditions, CO 2 mixes with crude oil (or mixture crude + gas) behaving like a thinning agent. The oil viscosity is, thereby, reduced and <b>flushed</b> out from <b>oil</b> reservoir by the means of water (Donaldson et al. 1989). In typical oil reservoir, {{it is common to}} find water that coexists with trapped crudes in the form of brine (or connate water). Brine, which consists mainly of sodium chloride (NaCl), has a concentration reported much higher to than of typical seawater. Often, it ranges from 1 to 30 wt% NaCl (Tarek 2007). During gas injection, the gas comes in contact with reservoir fluid(s) distributing immiscible fluids into distinct thermodynamic phases including gas rich, hydrocarbon rich, and water rich. Because of the complex chemical composition of the crude oil, the phase distribution computation is reported laborious. Thus, it is acceptable to model crude oil as a single component. Rather to singularize crude oil as a pseudo-component, this work has computed thermodynamic phase composition using crude oil modeled from its actual chemical composition.|$|R
50|$|On 23 September 2002, {{seven days}} after DTI Consumer Minister Melanie Johnson {{released}} the government Good Garage scheme, Forte Lubricants registered goodgaragescheme.com as a domain name. In 2003, just after motor industry representatives and {{representatives from the}} Office of Fair Trading (OFT) signed an agreement to create an industry run Good Garage Scheme, the Office of Fair Trading issued a car service checklist that recommended to garages what {{should be included in}} a service and enabled consumers to compare what different garages offer as part of a car service. Forte Lubricants then began using the Office of Fair Trading's car service checklist in its promotional material. The Office of Fair Trading felt that Forte Lubricants' usage of the checklist as well as usage of the OFT's name and logo in its marketing material lead to consumers to believe that the OFT recommended the use of a fuel system cleaner and an engine <b>oil</b> <b>flush,</b> neither of which were addressed by the Office of Fair Trading. In general, the OFT does not approve any products or recommend what products should be used by garages when providing a car service. In response to a request by the Office of Fair Trading, Forte Lubricants agreed in June 2003 to stop using the OFT's name and logo in Forte's marketing material as legal action was threatened against Forte.|$|R
40|$|Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is used widely as {{a thermal}} {{recovery}} technique in Canada {{to produce a}} very viscous bitumen formation. The main research objectives of this simulation and experimental study are to investigate oil recovery mechanisms under SAGD process with different injection fluids, including steam, solvent or steam with solvent. 2 D simulation studies based on typical Athabasca reservoir properties have been performed. Results show that a successful solvent co-injection design can utilize the advantages of solvent and steam. There is an optimal solvent type and concentration ratio range for a particular reservoir and operating condition. Long, continuous shale barriers located vertically above or near the wellbore delay production performance significantly. Co-injecting a multi-component solvent can <b>flush</b> out the <b>oil</b> in different areas with different drainage mechanisms from vaporized and liquid components. Placing an additional injector {{at the top of}} the reservoir results only in marginal improvement. The pure high-temperature diluent injection appears feasible, although further technical and economic evaluation of the process is required. A 2 D scaled physical model was fabricated that represented in cross-section a half symmetry element of a typical SAGD drainage volume in Athabasca. The experimental results show co-injecting a solvent mixture of C 7 and xylene with steam gives better production performance than the injection of pure steam or steam with C 7 at the study condition. Compared to pure steam injection runs (Run 0 and 1), coinjecting C 7 (Run 2) with steam increases the ultimate recovery factor of oil inside the cell from 25 percent to 29 percent and decreases the ultimate CSOR from 2. 2 to 1. 9 and the ultimate CEOR from 4892 J/cm 3 to 4326 J/cm 3; coinjecting C 7 and Xylene (Run 3) increases the ultimate recovery factor of oil from 25 percent to 34 percent, and decreases the ultimate CSOR 2. 2 to 1. 6 and the ultimate CEOR from 4892 J/cm 3 to 3629 J/cm 3. Analyses of the experimental results indicate that partial pressure and the near wellbore flow play important roles in production performance. In conclusion, a successful solvent injection design can effectively improve the production performance of SAGD. Further research on evaluating the performance of various hydrocarbon types as steam additives is desirable and recommended...|$|R
