5|$|Believing {{that men}} {{should not be}} <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote without women also being granted the franchise, Sojourner Truth, a former slave and feminist, {{affiliated}} herself with Stanton and Anthony's organization. Stanton, Anthony, and Truth were joined by Matilda Joslyn Gage, who later worked on The Woman's Bible with Stanton. Despite Stanton's position and the efforts of her and others to expand the Fifteenth Amendment to include voting rights for all women, this amendment also passed, as it was originally written, in 1870.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{explored}} coaching possibilities, {{but he was}} mindful not to {{put himself}} {{in a position where}} his control might be challenged as it had been in Cleveland. In the mid-1960s, the American Football League (AFL), which had formed to compete against the NFL, put a new franchise in Cincinnati. Brown was the third-largest investor in the team and was given the title of coach and general manager. He was also <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to represent the team in all league matters, a key element of control for Brown.|$|E
5|$|Four {{wins and}} a draw {{at home to}} Basel placed Barcelona {{on top of their}} group with a game to spare, and despite defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk on Matchday 6, they still had the third-best record amongst the qualifiers for the first {{knockout}} round. As group winners, Barcelona would avoid being drawn with other group winners, including Manchester United, Liverpool, Juventus and Bayern Munich, but they could still be drawn against runners-up such as Chelsea, Internazionale and Arsenal. The draw eventually paired them with Olympique Lyonnais and, as group winners, they were <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to play the second leg at home.|$|E

40|$|The article {{provides}} {{an attempt to}} find a solution to the simultaneous obtainance of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of refusal by a tenant and a co-owner. The case is not regulated by the legislator. Jurisprudence has advanced a conception which <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of refusal to the tenant in the first place, but the idea is not well underpinned. The author propounds another theory which <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of refusal to the co-owner, before <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of <b>the</b> tenant. He also attempts to comprehend the logic of the legislator's thinking, which might be useful {{to find a solution}} to the problem. Furthermore, the author argues that <b>giving</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of refusal to the co-owner in the first place is a compromise for both claimants. This solution excludes any detriment to the tenant's interests and the co-owner's as well (which are connected with the protection of ownership value) ...|$|R

At 16, males became eligible for military duty and were also considered adults for legal purposes, such as standing trial for crimes. Age 21 was the youngest at which a male could become a freeman, though for practical purposes this occurred some time in a man's mid-twenties. Twenty-one was the assumed age of inheritance, as well, although the law respected the rights of the deceased to name an earlier age in his will.|$|E

5|$|After the United States entered World WarI in 1917, 131 {{men from}} Children of Israel enlisted or were drafted; one was killed. By 1919, the congregation's family {{membership}} had reached 450, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $18,000 (today $). The congregational school, which still held classes once a week, had 14 teachers and 388 students. The following year, women were <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote at all congregational meetings. Fineshriber left in 1924 to become head rabbi of Congregation Keneseth Israel in Philadelphia.

At the latter is the small community of Slate River Valley, though relatively few residences are located on the highway. At Barrie Drive, twokilometres north of the community, the highway turns east; a channelized right turn lane is provided for northbound traffic while southbound traffic is <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of way at the intersection.

On 19 August 1988, the airline was granted concession to fly to Billund in Denmark. At the same time, Air-X was granted concession to fly the route via Sandefjord and Skien. The route started on 2 May 1989. Previously the rules stated that if SAS flew to a non-Scandinavian destination from any capital, no other Scandinavian airlines could fly to that city. Braathens SAFE lost many contracts in the charter market in 1990, following Scanair's purchase of larger Douglas DC-10 aircraft. On 18 May 1990, Braathens SAFE was awarded the concession a route from Oslo, Bergen and Stavanger to Newcastle, which opened on 3 April 1991. The airline was also awarded the route from Tromsø to Murmansk, Russia, once per week from 28 January 1993.|$|E

In Liechtenstein, women were <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to vote by the women's suffrage referendum of 1984.

5|$|The Nagorno-Karabakh {{movement}} that had originally begun in Armenia {{during the late}} 1980s called for the Karabakh enclave to be united with that country, despite it being behind the borders of Azerbaijan. With a population that was 75 percent Armenian, official petitions were sent by Armenian leaders to the Soviet government in Moscow {{in order to address}} the issue but were rejected by General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. The demands to annex the region came in the middle of Gorbachev's reform policies, Glasnost and Perestroika. First implemented in 1985, when Gorbachev came into power, the liberalization of political and economical constraints in the Soviet Union gave birth to numerous nationalist groups in the different Soviet republics who insisted that they be <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to secede and form their own independent countries.|$|E
