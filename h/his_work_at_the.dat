5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Blatty worked {{as the public}} {{relations}} director at Loyola University of Los Angeles and as a publicity director at the University of Southern California. He published his first book, Which Way to Mecca, Jack? in 1960, a humorous look at both his early life, and <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> United States Information Agency in Lebanon. In 1961, while still working in public relations, Blatty appeared as a contestant on the Groucho Marx quiz show You Bet Your Life, winning $10,000, enough money to quit his job and to write full-time. Thereafter, he never held a regular job.|$|E
5|$|In the new Taliesin, Wright {{worked to}} repair his {{tarnished}} reputation. He secured {{a commission to}} design the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, Japan; when the building was undamaged following the 1923 earthquake, Wright's reputation was restored. Although he later expanded the agricultural wing, Wright spent little time at the second Taliesin house, often living near his construction sites abroad. Instead of serving as a full-time residence, Wright treated Taliesin like an art museum for his collection of Asian works. Wright only truly lived at Taliesin II starting in 1922, after <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Imperial Hotel was completed.|$|E

5|$|The {{monument}} {{was erected}} {{to commemorate the}} native inhabitants of Comahue. It was constructed for the first Comahue National Fair, in 1964. This was a 45-day event that aimed to highlight the economic potential of the Comahue Region, {{and at the same}} time commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of Villa Regina. Bartolo Pasin and Rogelio Chimenti, who organized the fair, proposed the construction to designer Miguel De Lisi, after seeing <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> City Hotel in Mar del Plata.|$|E
5|$|After <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> UN, Soedjatmoko {{attempted}} {{to study at}} Harvard's Littauer Center for Public Administration (now the John F. Kennedy School of Government); however, {{he was forced to}} resign due to pressure from other work, including serving as Indonesia's first chargé d'affaires in London for three months as well as establishing the political desk at the Embassy of Indonesia in Washington, D.C. By 1952 he had returned to Indonesia, where he became involved in the socialist press and joined the Socialist Party of Indonesia. He was elected {{as a member of the}} Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia in 1955, serving until 1959; he married Ratmini Gandasubrata in 1958. However, as President Sukarno's government became more authoritarian Soedjatmoko began to criticise the government. To avoid censorship, he spent two years as a guest lecturer at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and another three in self-imposed unemployment in Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the {{bimetallic}} relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It is a matter of debate as whether he intended to do this or not. It has been argued that Newton conceived of <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.|$|E
5|$|By February 1968 Harrison {{decided to}} leave, as Cohen was showing {{no signs of}} abandoning the reprints. He resigned, and {{suggested}} Barry Malzberg to Cohen as a possible successor. Cohen knew Malzberg from <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Scott Meredith Literary Agency, and thought {{that he might be}} more amenable than Harrison to continuing the reprint policy. Malzberg took over in April 1968, but immediately came into conflict with Cohen over the reprints, and then threatened to resign in October 1968 over a disagreement about artwork Malzberg had commissioned for a cover. Cohen contacted Robert Silverberg, then the president of SFWA, and told him (falsely) that Malzberg had actually resigned. Silverberg recommended Ted White as a replacement. Cohen secured White's agreement and then fired Malzberg; White assumed control with the May 1969 issue.|$|E
5|$|Etty was {{prolific}} and commercially successful {{throughout the}} 1840s, {{but the quality}} of his work deteriorated throughout this period. As his health progressively worsened he retired to York in 1848. He died in 1849, shortly after a major retrospective exhibition. In the immediate aftermath of his death his works became highly collectable and sold for large sums. Changing tastes meant his work later fell out of fashion, and imitators soon abandoned his style. By the end of the 19th century the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices, and outside his native York he remained little known throughout the 20th century. Etty's inclusion in Tate Britain's landmark Exposed: The Victorian Nude exhibition in 2001–02, the high-profile restoration of his The Sirens and Ulysses in 2010 and a major retrospective of <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> York Art Gallery in 2011–12 led to renewed interest in his work.|$|E
25|$|In {{celebration of}} his 75th {{birthday}} he conducted three of <b>his</b> <b>works</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Rheingau Musik Festival in 2008, among them Ciaccona from the Polish Requiem.|$|R
25|$|He {{went back}} for good during {{the autumn of}} 1947, where he {{attended}} the opening of <b>the</b> exhibition of <b>his</b> <b>works</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Musée National d'Art Moderne.|$|R
50|$|A {{painter in}} both watercolours and oils, Blacklock {{exhibited}} 17 <b>works</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Royal Academy between 1897 and 1918, and also exhibited <b>his</b> <b>works</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Royal Institute of Oil Painters.|$|R
5|$|His {{best known}} popular work is his Dictionary of Plant Names, which {{found its way}} into the {{libraries}} of most horticulturalists. One of the focuses of <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Natural History Museum was the flora of the Caribbean, where he carried out field work. Stearn continued to return to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, cared for his own garden and worked with the RHS to become an authority on horticulture as well as botany. William Stearn collaborated with his wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, on a number of his most important works, including Botanical Latin and Dictionary of Plant Names and translating German botanical history into English. Just before his death he completed a revision of his original Epimedium monograph.|$|E
5|$|In 1503, Cairano {{made the}} last {{deliveries}} in the Caesar cycle {{for the front}} of the Loggia palace, and finished up the bulk of his work on the site; no further records of his presence exist. For the artist, this was the end of his big public commissions, which he probably gained before establishing his career and subsequent success. He now had to reorganise his business and set up closer ties with the contacts he made during <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Loggia, including co-workers and other artists in and around Brescia, looking for major commissions. However, his path appeared to lead him increasingly toward sacred art. In 1504, the canon of the Basilica of San Pietro de Dom, Francisco Franzi of Orzinuovi bequeathed the construction of a chapel in the cathedral. Nothing further is known of this commission.|$|E
5|$|In 1906 he was {{promoted}} to temporary Brigadier–General and in 1908 he married Winifride Mary, with whom he would have one son. In 1910 <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> staff college was recognised with the award of the Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the King's Birthday Honours. In 1911, after a brief period of half-pay in his permanent rank of Colonel, Capper was transferred from India to Ireland, where he commanded the 13th Infantry Brigade until 1913. He returned to Ireland briefly a year later {{in the aftermath of the}} Curragh Incident, to support his friend Hubert Gough. During early 1914, Capper was briefly the Inspector of Infantry but in the emergency of the summer of 1914 he {{was promoted}} to substantive Major-General and posted to the regular 7th Division, which was sent to the Western Front.|$|E
50|$|In 1867, Willewalde {{displayed}} <b>his</b> <b>works</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> International Exhibition in Paris. In 1873, <b>his</b> <b>works</b> were {{exhibited in}} Vienna, followed by Antwerp in 1885, and Berlin in 1886.|$|R
50|$|Little {{appreciated}} in his time, in 1942, {{an exhibition}} of <b>his</b> <b>works</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Brooklyn Museum of Art led to his rediscovery as an important figure in American art.|$|R
