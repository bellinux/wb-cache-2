[...] McCay consulted with New York museum staff to ensure the accuracy of Gertie's movements; the staff were unable to help him find out how an extinct animal would stand up from a lying position, so in {{a scene in which}} Gertie stood up, McCay had a <b>flying</b> <b>lizard</b> come on screen to draw away viewers' attention.

2500|$|In GT2 the <b>Flying</b> <b>Lizard</b> Porsche was {{the first}} to drop out after a tire {{puncture}} before the start. The #82 Risi Competizione Ferrari was quickly recovering from its penalty and at just over two hours was right behind the class leading Corvettes. The class lead was swapped several times until the #82 Ferrari suffered a gearbox failure and would not emerge again. The #63 Corvette suffered reliability issues at night, while the #64 Corvette was in the GT2 lead, running a full two laps ahead of the Felbermayr-Proton Porsche. With less than seven hours to go the #64 lost grip and spun in the Porsche Curves as the #1 Peugeot with Anthony Davidson at the wheel was lapping the Corvette. Emmanuel Collard managed to bring the car back to the pits but subsequent repairs cost them ten laps and soon engine failure followed on the Corvette. Team Felbermayr-Proton took the GT2 lead and a very consistent run saw the team holding onto the lead until the finish. They won the LMGT2 category for Porsche, their first since their [...] win. The drivers had claimed that their car was about half a second off the Ferrari and Corvette's pace.|$|E
6000|$|Lying on it, {{as we go}} south-eastward, appear {{alternate}} beds {{of sandy}} limestone, with vast depths of clay between them. These [...] "oolites," [...] or freestones, furnish the famous Bath stone, the Oxford stone, and the Barnack stone of Northamptonshire, of which {{some of the finest}} cathedrals are built--a stone only surpassed, I believe, by the Caen stone, which comes from beds of the same age in Normandy. These freestones and clays abound in fossils, but of kinds, be it remembered, which differ more and more from those of the lias beneath, as the beds are higher in the series, and therefore nearer. [...] There, too, are found principally the bones of that extraordinary <b>flying</b> <b>lizard,</b> the Pterodactyle, which had wings formed out of its fore-legs, on somewhat the same plan as those of a bat, but with one exception. In the bat, as any one may see, four fingers of the hand are lengthened to carry the wing, while the first alone is left free, as a thumb: but in the Pterodactyle, the outer or [...] "little" [...] finger alone is lengthened, and the other four fingers left free--one of those strange instances in nature of the same effect being produced in widely different plants and animals, and yet by slightly different means, on which a whole chapter of natural philosophy--say, rather, natural theology--will have to be written some day.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the most}} curious and {{interesting}} reptiles which I met with in Borneo was a large tree-frog, which was brought me {{by one of the}} Chinese workmen. He assured me that he had seen it come down in a slanting direction from a high tree, as if it flew. On examining it, I found the toes very long and fully webbed to their very extremity, so that when expanded they offered a surface much larger than the body. The forelegs were also bordered by a membrane, and the body was capable of considerable inflation. The back and limbs were of a very deep shining green colour, the undersurface and the inner toes yellow, while the webs were black, rayed with yellow. The body was about four inches long, while the webs of each hind foot, when fully expanded, covered a surface of four square inches, and the webs of all the feet together about twelve square inches. As the extremities of the toes have dilated discs for adhesion, showing the creature to be a true tree frog, {{it is difficult to imagine}} that this immense membrane of the toes can be for the purpose of swimming only, and the account of the Chinaman, that it flew down from the tree, becomes more credible. This is, I believe, the first instance known of a [...] "flying frog," [...] and it is very interesting to Darwinians as showing that the variability of the toes which have been already modified for purposes of swimming and adhesive climbing, have been taken advantage of to enable an allied species to pass through the air like the <b>flying</b> <b>lizard.</b> It would appear to be a new species of the genus Rhacophorus, which consists of several frogs of a much smaller size than this, and having the webs of the toes less developed.|$|E

40|$|The island arc west of {{the island}} of Sumatra in Indonesia, here {{referred}} to as the Western Archipelago, is home to many endemic flora and fauna. Despite their importance in the biogeographic theater of insular Southeast Asia, little scientific attention has been given to these islands, {{with the exception of the}} four islands that comprise the Mentawai group. In this dissertation, I used the evolutionary history of the <b>flying</b> <b>lizards</b> in the genus Draco to elucidate the biogeographical history of Western Archipelago relative to its neighboring mega-island Sumatra. In Chapter 1, I provide an updated checklist of the herpetofauna of the islands in the archipelago [...] a list that had not been revisited or updated in the last 20 years. My visit to the islands of Western Archipelago proved to add considerably to our knowledge of the herpetofauna occurring in the area. In Chapter 2, I present a revision of the molecular phylogeny of the genus Draco by incorporating sequence data from nuclear markers. And finally, in Chapter 3 I looked at the phylogenetics and population genetics of the most widely distributed species of <b>flying</b> <b>lizards</b> in Sunda Shelf [...] Draco sumatranus the common <b>flying</b> <b>lizards</b> [...] to discern the historical process by which they colonized the islands of the Western Archipelago. Using one mitochondrial locus and nine nuclear loci, I employed phylogenetic and coalescent-based population genetic methods to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Draco sumatranus. My results suggest that the islands of Simeulue, Nias, Siberut, Sipora, North & South Pagai and Enggano are monophyletic, but the Batu and Banyak Islands themselves are more closely related to Northwest Sumatran populations. This divergence is inferred to have occurred ~ 550, 000 years ago. These findings reject the hypothesis of independent overwater dispersal onto each island, and support the hypothesis that the Western Archipelago had been colonized via the Batu and Banyak Islands and was subsequently isolated by a vicariant event [...] most likely related to the Pleistocene changes in sea levels. I also uncovered deep divergences of Sumatran D. sumatranus populations that cannot be adequately explained simply by the emergence of the Sunda Shelf basin during the last glacial maxima, or the modern-day geography of the island. This hints at the cryptic diversity harbored within Sumatra, and merits a more rigorous study of the island's biogeography...|$|R

5|$|While the dinosaur-bird {{connection}} (or lack thereof) {{was being}} pursued in paleontology, {{the problem of}} the evolution of flight was under scrutiny as well. It was observed that a number of animals with moderate flying or gliding ability, such as bats, <b>flying</b> <b>lizards</b> and <b>flying</b> squirrels have arboreal lifestyles. This led to the idea that the ancestors of birds must have gradually acquired the ability to fly from leaping among branches in the tops of trees. The Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa proposed an alternate hypothesis in 1907, arguing that the ancestors of birds were fast-running, bipedal animals related to theropod dinosaurs. When Heilmann came onto the paleontology scene, these two sets of conflicting theories provided the framework for his research and eventual conclusions.|$|R
