40|$|Vehicle Sketch Pad (OpenVSP) is a {{parametric}} geometry modeler {{that has}} been used extensively for conceptual design studies of aircraft, including studies using higher-order analysis. OpenVSP can model <b>flap</b> <b>and</b> <b>slat</b> surfaces using simple shearing of the airfoil coordinates, which is an appropriate level of complexity for lower-order aerodynamic analysis methods. For three-dimensional analysis, however, there is not a built-in method for defining the high-lift components in OpenVSP in a realistic manner, or for controlling their complex motions in a parametric manner that is intuitive to the designer. This paper seeks instead to utilize OpenVSP's existing capabilities, and establish a set of best practices for modeling high-lift components at a level of complexity suitable for higher-order analysis methods. Techniques are described for modeling the <b>flap</b> <b>and</b> <b>slat</b> components as separate three-dimensional surfaces, and for controlling their motion using simple parameters defined in the local hinge-axis frame of reference. To demonstrate the methodology, an OpenVSP model for the Energy-Efficient Transport (EET) AR 12 wind-tunnel model has been created, taking advantage of OpenVSP's Advanced Parameter Linking capability to translate the motions of the high-lift components from the hinge-axis coordinate system to a set of transformations in OpenVSP's frame of reference...|$|E

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{circulation}} control wing {{is to increase the}} lifting force of an aircraft at times when large lifting forces at low speeds are required, such as takeoff <b>and</b> landing. Wing <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>slats</b> are currently used during landing on almost all aircraft and on takeoff by larger jets. While <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>slats</b> are effective in increasing lift, they do so at a high cost of drag. The benefit of the circulation control wing is that no extra drag is created and the lift coefficient is greatly increased. It is being claimed that such a system could increase the landing coefficient of lift of a Boeing 737 by 150% to 250%, thus reducing approach speeds by 35% to 45% and landing distances by 55% to 75% and that such advances in wing design could allow for dramatic wing size reduction in large, wide body jets.|$|R

50|$|The NTSB {{examined}} why {{the plane}} was unable to climb once it departed the runway. After conducting airplane performance studies, the NTSB determined that the events of Flight 1141 could only {{be explained by the}} aircraft attempting to take off without its <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>slats</b> extended to the proper take-off configuration. The aircraft's instability and sudden roll to the right was consistent with known performance of the Boeing 727 with the <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>slats</b> retracted. The captain continued to pull back on the control column in an attempt to keep the plane's nose raised, which created turbulence over the rear-mounted engines and caused the compressor surges. However, the NTSB concluded that the compressor surges would not have significantly reduced the engines' thrust, and that the plane's failure to gain speed was due to aerodynamic drag on the aircraft due to the high angle of attack, rather than a loss of engine thrust. The NTSB examined the CVR and noted that neither pilot is heard announcing the deployment of the flaps or slats, nor is the sound of the flap lever movement heard. The NTSB considered it extremely unlikely that a pilot would have moved either the flaps or the slats without announcing their actions {{to the rest of the}} flight crew. Based on the aircraft's failure to climb at takeoff speed, its roll instability, and the absence of sounds indicating the flaps or slats were deployed, the NTSB determined that the plane's failure to climb resulted from the flight crew's failure to deploy the <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>slats</b> as required by the pre-flight checklist.|$|R
