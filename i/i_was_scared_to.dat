Scherzinger was hesitant at first, stating in an interview that: [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> death to touch it [...] afraid for people to hear it before I even wrote it". Scherzinger put her [...] "heart into writing the lyrics and put in themes from the film Slumdog Millionaire. Love and destiny were elements from the movie that she put into the track". She stated that she [...] "prayed every night to do this right". Fair and Iovine additionally hired Brick & Lace, The Writing Camp and Ester Dean to write their own interpretation of the song.|$|E
500|$|Producer Norman Dayron {{recalled}} the young Butterfield as [...] "very quiet and defensive and hard-edged. He was this tough Irish Catholic, {{kind of a}} hard guy. He would walk around in black shirts and sunglasses, dark shades and dark jackets... Paul was hard to be friends with." [...] Although they later became close, Michael Bloomfield commented on his first impressions of Butterfield: [...] "He was a bad guy. [...] He carried pistols. He was down there on the South Side, holding his own. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> death of that cat". Writer and AllMusic founder Michael Erlewine, who knew Butterfield early in his recording career, described him as [...] "always intense, somewhat remote, and even, on occasion, downright unfriendly". He remembered Butterfield as [...] "not much interested in other people".|$|E
500|$|British pop {{and soul}} singer Jahméne Douglas {{released}} a cover version of [...] "Titanium" [...] on July 22, 2013 {{as the lead}} single from his debut studio album, Love Never Fails (2013). Douglas' version peaked at number 94 on the UK Singles Chart. Talking to Digital Spy, Douglas said: [...] "It's very hard to sing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> do it because it's a big chart song and I'm quite old school. For me, the song is about strength and the music video is based around domestic violence and how a woman gets out of it. The lyrics are so powerful for that interpretation. Hopefully if someone is in that situation and watches it, they'll think, I can get out." [...] A music video to accompany the release of [...] "Titanium" [...] was first released onto YouTube on June 12, 2013 at a total length of three minutes and fifty-four seconds. The music video shows Douglas next to a piano, while a story of domestic abuse plays out.|$|E

500|$|McGovern {{enrolled}} at small Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell {{and became a}} star student there. He supplemented a forensic scholarship by working a variety of odd jobs. With World War II underway overseas and feeling insecure about his own courage, McGovern took flying lessons in an Aeronca aircraft and received a pilot's license through the government's Civilian Pilot Training Program. McGovern recalled: [...] "Frankly, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> death on that first solo flight. But when I walked away from it, I had an enormous feeling of satisfaction that I had taken the thing {{off the ground and}} landed it without tearing the wings off." [...] In late 1940 or early 1941, McGovern had a brief affair with an acquaintance that resulted in her giving birth to a daughter during 1941, although this did not become public knowledge during his lifetime. In April 1941, McGovern began dating fellow student Eleanor Stegeberg, who had grown up in Woonsocket, South Dakota. They had first encountered each other during a high school debate in which Eleanor and her twin sister Ila defeated McGovern and his partner.|$|E
500|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{story of}} how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a [...] "ginger vision"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; {{he played in the}} set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, [...] "they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it." [...] Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had [...] "just been filling in for the last fifteen years." ...|$|E

In an interview with Zee News, he said, [...] "Initially <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> do the show as we were travelling on a different path. I was worried.

[...] He also had said how he is interested in and loves looking into different [...] belief systems and faith, how it matters to other people, and how these various religious teachings are important to him in his world. He sought treatment for alcoholism by going into rehab in the 1990s. After an initial recovery, he temporarily withdrew from show business, retreating to his ranches in California, and Las Vegas, New Mexico to breed Arabian horses. His best-known horse was Tammen, a chestnut Arabian stallion.|$|E
2500|$|Natalie Teeger (Traylor Howard; seasons 3–8) is Monk's {{second and}} final assistant. Although {{she is more}} deferential to her boss than Sharona, {{referring}} to him as [...] "Mr. Monk", she is not hesitant about telling him when his eccentricities are going too far. A young widow who lives with her daughter Julie, Natalie lost her husband Mitch {{when he was shot}} down over Kosovo in 1998. She first appears in [...] "Mr. Monk and the Red Herring" [...] (3.10). Natalie was introduced partway through season three when Bitty Schram, who played Sharona, left [...] "precipitous", reportedly over a contract dispute. Traylor Howard had not yet seen the show and was unenthusiastic about her manager's urgings to audition as Schram's replacement. She nevertheless tried out and got the part. Despite her initial [...] "cool" [...] reception from fans, show co-creator Andy Breckman believes Traylor quickly and successfully filled the void. [...] "I will always be grateful to Traylor because she came in when the show was in crisis and saved our baby [...] We had to make a hurried replacement, and not every show survives that. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> death." ...|$|E

When she found out she was pregnant while on the drug, both she and, admittedly, <b>I</b> <b>were</b> very <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> learn that the drug is teratogenic in that it causes MÃ¶bius syndrome. How great is the risk? ANSWER: Very small. Although women who use misoprostol during the first trimester have a 30 -fold higher risk of having babies with MÃ¶bius syndrome, the malformation is so rare that, even if you see 1000 women who took misoprostol during embryogenesis, you might not see a single child with the syndrome. It is crucial to explain the size of the risk; otherwise women tend to believe the risk is huge even when, in fact, it is hardly measurable...|$|R
