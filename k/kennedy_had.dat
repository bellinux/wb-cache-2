5|$|Using another metric, <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> a {{lifetime}} average liberal score of 88.7 percent, {{according to a}} National Journal analysis that places him ideologically as the third-most liberal senator of all those in office in 2009.|$|E
5|$|A special {{election}} {{was scheduled for}} January 19, 2010, for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts left vacant by Kennedy's death. Shortly before his death, <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> written to Democratic Governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick and the Massachusetts legislature to change state law to allow an appointee to fill a U.S. Senate vacancy, for a term expiring upon the {{special election}}. (<b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> been instrumental in the prior 2004 alteration of this law to prevent Governor Mitt Romney from appointing a Republican senator should John Kerry's presidential campaign succeed.) The law was amended, and on September 24, 2009, Paul G. Kirk, former Democratic National Committee chairman and former aide to Kennedy, was appointed to occupy the Senate seat until {{the completion of the}} special election. Kirk announced {{that he would not be}} a candidate in the special election. In that election, Republican State Senator Scott Brown won the seat in a stunning upset, ending Democratic control of it going back to 1953.|$|E

5|$|Both sides had injury {{concerns}} {{before the}} match. Liverpool had doubts {{over a number}} of players. Kenny Dalglish had not trained for several weeks, while Alan <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> been sidelined for six weeks with a broken wrist. Real had concerns over striker Laurie Cunningham who had been sidelined since November.|$|E
5|$|By {{the later}} {{years of his}} life, <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> come {{to be viewed as}} a major figure and {{spokesman}} for American progressivism. In 2008, Kennedy was hospitalized after suffering a seizure and was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor, which limited his appearances in the Senate. He died at age 77 on August 25, 2009, at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Political {{scientists}} gauge {{ideology in}} part by comparing the annual ratings by the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) with the ratings by the American Conservative Union (ACU). <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> a lifetime liberal 90 percent score from the ADA through 2004, while the ACU awarded Kennedy a lifetime conservative rating of 2 percent through 2008.|$|E

5|$|After {{the triumph}} of the {{previous}} season, the 1945–46 season was a complete loss for Kennedy. He got off to a slow start, beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill. By January <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost {{for the rest of the}} season due to an injury to his foot, when a Boston Bruin player's skate dug into his boot. With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1968, <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> {{joined the}} new Committee for National Health Insurance at the {{invitation}} of its founder, United Auto Workers president Walter Reuther. In May 1970, Reuther died and Senator Ralph Yarborough, chairman of the full Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee and its Health subcommittee, lost his primary election, propelling Kennedy into a leadership role on the issue of national health insurance. Kennedy introduced a bipartisan bill in August 1970 for single-payer universal national health insurance with no cost sharing, paid for by payroll taxes and general federal revenue.|$|E
5|$|Both {{candidates}} {{agreed to}} four televised debates, {{three of which}} were held. The candidates agreed to a fourth debate {{which was to be}} held on October 30 in WGBH-TV's studio, hosted by a Boston media consortium, and moderated by John King, but the day before both pulled out due to Hurricane Sandy. Victoria Kennedy, widow of Ted <b>Kennedy,</b> <b>had</b> proposed an additional debate with Tom Brokaw as moderator, however Brown would only accept the invitation if she pledged not to endorse Brown's opponent; which she refused.|$|E

5000|$|After {{this brief}} exchange, West turned off his tape {{recorder}} and followed Kennedy {{and his entourage}} to the kitchen pantry. Just a few minutes later, seconds after Kennedy was shot, West turned his recorder on again and started reporting the sudden developments.....Andrew West: [...] "Senator <b>Kennedy</b> <b>has</b> been shot! Senator <b>Kennedy</b> <b>has</b> been shot; is that possible? Is that possible? It's.....is it possible, ladies and gentlemen? It is possible, he has.....not only Senator Kennedy, oh my God.

5|$|He {{was a close}} {{political}} ally of President John F. Kennedy, a {{fact that}} disturbed some North Carolina Democrats suspicious of Kennedy's Catholicism. According to Kennedy's personal secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, Sanford would have been Kennedy's choice for vice president on the 1964 Democratic ticket if <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> lived. In her 1968 book Kennedy and Johnson she reported that Kennedy, told her that Lyndon B. Johnson would be replaced as Vice President.|$|E
5|$|On May 17, 2008, Kennedy {{suffered}} a seizure, {{and then another}} one as he was rushed from the Kennedy Compound to Cape Cod Hospital and then by helicopter to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Within days, doctors announced that <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> a malignant glioma, a type of cancerous brain tumor. The grim diagnosis brought reactions of shock and prayer from many senators of both parties and from President Bush.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 1963, Kennedy was {{presiding}} over the Senate—a task given to junior members—when an aide rushed in {{to tell him that}} his brother, President John F. <b>Kennedy,</b> <b>had</b> been shot. His brother Robert soon told him that the President was dead. Ted and his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver immediately flew to the family home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, to give the news to their invalid father, who had been afflicted by a stroke suffered two years earlier.|$|E

5|$|Smythe {{was able}} to talk Kennedy into playing the 1954–55 season. At the {{conclusion}} of the season, he won the Hart Memorial Trophy, for most valuable player, and is the last Toronto Maple Leaf to have won the trophy. To this point <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> had an impressive career. He had played on five Stanley Cup teams, something no other NHL player had achieved at the time. Toronto had only missed the playoffs twice during his eleven years, one of which Kennedy was injured. By age 22 he had won three Stanley Cups and was the youngest player to have scored 100 goals. Yet, <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> never won an award, nor been elected to a first All-Star team. Although he did finish third in the league in assists, awarding Kennedy the Hart was considered as much as an acknowledgement of his career as his performance in the season. Kennedy along with first ever Hart recipient Frank Nighbor, are the only forwards to have won the award without finishing in the top ten in league scoring. After the Leafs were swept in four straight games in the playoffs by the Detroit Red Wings, Kennedy announced his retirement. For the second time, Kennedy was awarded with the J. P. Bickell Memorial Trophy as most valuable Toronto Maple Leaf.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} plagued with {{problems}} from the outset. The first was scope. President <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> begun considering {{the structure of}} his library soon after taking office, {{and he wanted to}} include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays.|$|E
5|$|Toronto faced Detroit in the Stanley Cup final. Toronto won {{the first}} three games of the series without giving up a goal, as rookie goaltender Frank McCool {{recorded}} consecutive shutouts. Toronto then had to ward off a determined Detroit comeback bid, before winning the Stanley Cup in the seventh game. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> continued with a strong performance against Detroit, scoring the game-winning goal in game 2, was chosen the first star (best player) of game 3 and scored all three goals in a 5–3 loss in game 5.|$|E

5|$|<b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> {{initially}} opposed busing schoolchildren across racial lines, but grew {{to support}} the practice as it became a focal point of civil rights efforts. After federal judge W. Arthur Garrity ordered the Boston School Committee in 1974 to racially integrate Boston's public schools via busing, Kennedy made a surprise appearance at a September 1974 anti-busing rally in City Hall Plaza to express the need for peaceful dialogue and was met with extreme hostility. The predominantly white crowd yelled insults about his children and hurled tomatoes and eggs {{at him as he}} retreated into the John F. Kennedy Federal Building and {{went so far as to}} push against one of its glass walls and break it.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{was spotted}} by Arsenal playing for New Hartley Juniors, {{and though the}} scouts had {{initially}} gone to the game to watch his striker partner Watts, <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> impressed enough to win an apprentice contract with Arsenal in May 1968. He then signed professional forms with the club in November 1968. He had a difficult task though to win a first team place, as manager Bertie Mee used only 15 players throughout the entire 1968–69 season, during which time Kennedy made 20 appearances for the Reserve team as they claimed the Football Combination Division One title.|$|E
5|$|Robert Kennedy {{was chosen}} by McCarthy as a counsel for his investigatory committee, but {{resigned}} after six months due to disagreements with McCarthy and Committee Counsel Roy Marcus Cohn. Joseph <b>Kennedy</b> <b>had</b> a national network of contacts and became a vocal supporter, building McCarthy's popularity among Catholics and making sizable contributions to McCarthy's campaigns. The Kennedy patriarch hoped {{that one of his}} sons would be president. Mindful of the anti-Catholic prejudice Al Smith faced during his 1928 campaign for that office, Joseph Kennedy supported McCarthy as a national Catholic politician who might pave the way for a younger Kennedy's presidential candidacy.|$|E
