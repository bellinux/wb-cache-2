40|$|Complex package {{distribution}} {{systems are}} designed using idealizations of network geometries, operating costs, demand and customer distributions, and routing patterns. The {{goal is to}} find simple, yet realistic, guidelines to design and operate a network that is integrated both by transportation mode and service level; i. <b>e.,</b> <b>overnight</b> (express) and longer (deferred) deadlines. The decision variables and parameters that define the problem are presented along with the models that approximate {{the total cost of}} operation. The design problem is then reduced to a series of optimization subproblems that can be solved easily. The proposed approach provides valuable insight for the design and operation of integrated package distribution systems. Qualitative conclusions suggest that benefits of integration are greater when deferred demand exceeds express demand. This insight helps to explain the different business strategies of package delivery firms in industry today.

40|$|What is the {{function}} of sleep in humans? One claim is that sleep consolidates learning. Slow wave activity (SWA), i. e. slow oscillations of frequency < 4 Hz, has been observed in electroencephalograms (EEG) during sleep; it increases with prior wakefulness and decreases with sleep. Studies have claimed that increase in SWA in specific regions of the sleeping brain is correlated with overnight improved performance, i. <b>e.</b> <b>overnight</b> consolidation, on a demanding motor learning task. We wondered if SWA change during sleep is attributable to overnight consolidation or to metabolic demand. Participants executed out-and-back movements to a target using a pen-like cursor with their dominant hand while the target and cursor position were displayed on a screen. They trained on three different conditions on separate nights, differing in the amount and degree of rotation between the actual hand movement direction and displayed cursor movement direction. In the no-rotation (NR) condition, there was no rotation. In the single rotation (SR) condition, the amount of rotation remained the same throughout, and performance improved both across pre-sleep training and after sleep, i. <b>e.</b> <b>overnight</b> consolidation occurred; in the random rotation (RR) condition, the amount of rotation varied randomly from trial to trial, and no overnight consolidation occurred; SR and RR were cognitively demanding. The average EEG power density of SWA for the first 30 min. of non-rapid eye movement sleep after training was computed. Both SR and RR elicited increase in SWA in the parietal region; furthermore, the topographic distribution of SWA in each was remarkably similar. No correlation {{was found between the}} overnight performance improvement on SR and the SWA change in the parietal region on measures of learning. Our results argue that regulation of SWA in early sleep is associated with high levels of cognitive effort during prior wakefulness, and not just overnight consolidation...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of {{financial}} crises and monetary policy on the supply of wholesale funding liquidity, and also on the compositional supply effects through cross-border and relationship lending. For empirical identification, we draw on the proprietary bank-to-bank European interbank dataset extracted from Target 2 and also exploit the Lehman and sovereign crisis shocks {{as well as the}} main Eurosystem non-standard monetary policy measures. The robust results imply that the crisis shocks lead to worse access, volumes and spreads (in both the overnight and longer-term maturities). The quantitative impact on interbank access and volume is stronger than on spreads. Liquidity supply restrictions are exacerbated for cross- border lending after the Lehman failure; for banks headquartered in periphery countries, the impact is quantitatively stronger in the sovereign debt crisis. Moreover, the interbank market - unlike other credit markets - allows to exploit the price dispersion from different lenders on identical credit contracts, i. <b>e.</b> <b>overnight</b> uncollateralized loans in the same morning for the same borrower. This price dispersion increases massively with the crisis, and even more for riskier borrowers.

Addition of up to 500 microng of SPS per ml to 80 % (vol/vol) fresh human serum failed to neutralize transferrin-mediated, "late" bacteriostasis against control strain E. coli C, an effect that was demonstrable only after prolonged, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>overnight,</b> incubation of the test strain.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Processing and {{properties}} of composite-to-composite bonding using Scotch-WeldTM AF- 555 M structural adhesive were investigated. Bonding surfaces of T 800 H/ 3900 - 2 composite were prepared by co-curing the dry and wet peel-plies. Surface topologies of the peel-plies and the co-cured composite surfaces were examined by microscopy, contour mapping using a {{coordinate measuring machine}} equipped with a ruby sphere probe, and contact angle goniometry. Curing of the adhesive was conducted in an autoclave or vacuum press at 1778 C (3508 F) for 2 h under 310 KPa (45 psi). Common bagging practices for composite fabrication in an autoclave were followed. It was found that a prolonged vacuum application (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>overnight)</b> prior to the application of temperature and pressure was a critical element to produce porosity-free, high-quality bonds with this adhesive system. Following this procedure, a strong bond line was consistently produced, which routinely provided a single-lap shear strength more than 10 % higher than the nominal value of the adhesive (i. e., 35. 9 MPa or 5200 psi) when tested at room temperature. An adhesive failure mode at the interface was noted on the fractured surfaces of specimens with strong bonds whereas a premature cohesive failure mode was more evident for the specimens with weaker bonds, probably due to porosities in the bond lines. Photomicrographs showed that the weak single-lap shear strengths occurred on specimens with significant porosity in the bond line, apparently caused by entrapped air from insufficient vacuum application prior to curing. The {{results of this study}} are discussed herein. KEY WORDS: AF- 555 M adhesive, T 800 H/ 3900 - 2 composite, composite-to-composite adhesive bonding, single-lap shear strength...|$|E

A sample of fathers (n = 109) who had attended a court ordered divorce education program completed mailed surveys assessing various aspects of their co-parenting relationship with their ex-spouse. Co-parenting was measured using two scales consisting of 12 and 14 items respectively designed to measure perceived co-parenting strategies of each parent. Sample items are as follows: "I use our child to get back at my ex-wife," "My ex-wife uses our child to get back at me," and "I deliver messages to my ex-wife through our child rather than say them to her directly. " Results showed that fathers' perceptions of their own co-parenting strategies as well as their perceptions of their ex-wives co-parenting strategies were significantly related to how often the children spent the night at their fathers' homes and to how often fathers visited with their children. Fathers' perceptions of their own co-parenting strategies, but not their perceptions of their ex-wives' co-parenting strategies, was significantly related to how often fathers talked to their child. The fathers' income and amount of child support paid per month were significantly related to all three types of contact (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>overnight</b> stays, frequency of talking with child, and frequency of visits). In addition, the length of the father's marriage to his ex-wife was significantly related to how often the child spent the night.

Some of the notable features include: (1) A conveniently transferrable chamber with 6 mesh-bottomed wells, each of which can hold dozens of zebrafish embryos. This design allows up to 6 different samples to be treated per chamber. (2) Each chamber sits in a well of a standard 6 -well tissue culture plate. Thus, up to 36 different samples can be processed in tandem using a single 6 well plate. (3) Precisely fitting lids prevent solution evaporation and condensation, even at high temperatures {{for an extended period}} of time: i. <b>e.,</b> <b>overnight</b> riboprobe hybridization. (4) Flat bottom mesh maximizes the consistent treatment of individual tissue samples. (5) A magnet-based lifter was created to handle up to 6 chambers (= 36 samples) in unison.

An important step towards mitigating {{this problem is}} to construct precise RF maps {{in the form of}} a conflict graph. Prior work on conflict graph construction, mostly using bandwidth tests [17], suffers from two problems: a) It is limited to static settings and cannot support mobility, and b) It incurs significant measurement overhead and must be performed offline (<b>e.</b> g. <b>overnight).</b> An alternative to bandwidth tests is “micro-probing ” [4] that operates on millisecond-level time scales. Micro-probing rapidly constructs the conflict graph even while the network is in use (i. e. online). While interesting in principle, micro-probing has only been evaluated in simulation. In this work, we empirically study microprobing on a 40 -node wireless testbed. In doing so, we not only show that micro-probing is in fact practically realizable, but also present key insights that drive the design choices for our implementation. We benchmark micro-probing against bandwidth tests and find that micro-probing is just as accurate but with up to a 400 times reduction in overhead. Finally, we argue that a successful implementation of microprobing opens up the space for further innovations in realtime WLAN adaptation and optimization. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDiffusion imaging of {{post-mortem}} brains {{could provide}} valuable data for validation of diffusion tractography of white matter pathways. Long scans (<b>e.</b> g., <b>overnight)</b> may also enable high-resolution diffusion images for visualization of fine structures. However, alterations to post-mortem tissue (T 2 and diffusion coefficient) present significant challenges to diffusion imaging with conventional diffusion-weighted spin echo (DW-SE) acquisitions, particularly for imaging human brains on clinical scanners. Diffusion-weighted steady-state free precession (DW-SSFP) {{has been proposed}} as an alternative acquisition technique to ameliorate this tradeoff in large-bore clinical scanners. In this study, both DWSE and DW-SSFP are optimized for use in fixed white matter on a clinical 3 -Tesla scanner. Signal calculations predict superior performance from DW-SSFP across {{a broad range of}} protocols and conditions. DW-SE and DW-SSFP data in a whole, post-mortem human brain are compared for 6 - and 12 -hour scan durations. Tractography is performed in major projection, commissural and association tracts (corticospinal tract, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus and cingulum bundle). The results demonstrate superior tract-tracing from DW-SSFP data, with 6 -hour DW-SSFP data performing as well as or better than 12 -hour DW-SE scans. These results suggest that DW-SSFP may be a preferred method for diffusion imaging of post-mortem human brains.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} large-scale network design problems, specifically {{the problem of}} designing the air network of an express shipment (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>overnight)</b> delivery operation. We focus on simultaneously determining the route structure, the assignment of fleet types to routes, and the flow of packages on aircraft. Traditional formulations for network design involve modeling both flow decisions and design decisions explicitly. The bounds provided by their linear programming relaxations are often weak. Common solution strategies strengthen the bounds by adding cuts, but the shear size of the express shipment problem results in models that are intractable. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce a new modeling approach that 1) removes the flow variables as explicit decisions and embeds them within the design variables and 2) combines the design variables into composite variables, which represent the selection of multiple aircraft routes that cover the demands for some subset of commodities. The resulting composite variable formulation provides tighter bounds and enables very good solutions to be found quickly. We apply this type of formulation to the express shipment operations of the United Parcel Service (UPS). Compared with existing plans, the model produces a solution that reduces the number of required aircraft by almost 11 percent and total annual cost by almost 25 percent. This translates to potential annual savings {{in the hundreds of}} millions of dollars. We establish the composite variable formulation to be at least as strong as the traditional network design formulation, even when the latter is strengthened by Chvital-Gomory rounding, and we demonstrate cases when strength is strictly improved. We also place the composite variable formulation in a more general setting by presenting it as a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition of the traditional (intractable) network design formulation and by comparing composite variables to Chvital-Gomory cuts in the dual of a related formulation. Finally, we present a composite variable formulation for the Pure Fixed Charge Transportation Problem to highlight the potential application of this approach to general network design and fixed-charge problems. by Andrew P.

40|$|The {{majority}} of clinical studies requires extensive management of human specimen including <b>e.</b> g. <b>overnight</b> shipping of blood samples {{in order to}} convey the samples in a central laboratory or to simultaneously analyze large numbers of patients. Storage of blood samples for periods of time before in vitro/ex vivo testing is known to influence the antigen expression {{on the surface of}} lymphocytes. In this context, the present results show {{for the first time that}} the T cell antigen CD 3 can be substantially detected on the surface of human B cells after ex vivo storage and that the degree of this phenomenon critically depends on temperature and duration after blood withdrawal. The appearance of CD 3 on the B cell surface seems to be a result of contact-dependent antigen exchange between T and B lymphocytes and is not attributed to endogenous production by B cells. Since cellular subsets are often classified by phenotypic analyses, our results indicate that ex vivo cellular classification in peripheral blood might result in misleading interpretations. Therefore, in order to obtain results reflecting the in vivo situation, it is suggested to minimize times of ex vivo blood storage after isolation of PBMC. Moreover, to enable reproducibility of results between different research groups and multicenter studies, we would emphasize the necessity to specify and standardize the storage conditions, which might be the basis of particular findings...|$|R
40|$|Primers, {{specific}} for {{a unique}} base substitution in uidA of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, were coupled with oligonucleotides for the shiga-like toxin I (SLT-I) and SLT-II genes in a multiplex PCR assay. A minimum of 10 (2) CFU per PCR (10 microliters) {{was necessary to}} amplify E. coli O 157 :H 7 -specific bands by multiplex PCR. Food particles as well as various unknown metabolic by-products of bacteria inhibited the PCR, but a simple two-step filtration procedure eliminated this inhibition. To reliably generate PCR products, an E. coli inoculum of 10 (3) CFU g of food slurry- 1 in a nonspecific medium was required with 6 h of enrichment at 37 degrees C. However, when the food homogenate was incubated <b>overnight,</b> <b>E.</b> coli O 157 :H 7 at an initial inoculum of even 1 CFU g- 1 was detected...|$|R
40|$|High {{performance}} {{parallel computing}} {{depends on the}} interaction {{of a number of}} factors including the processors, the architecture of the compute nodes, their interconnect network, and the numerical code. In this note, we present performance and scalability studies on the cluster tara using a well established parallelized code for a three-species application problem. This application problem requires long-time simulations on a fine mesh, thus posing a very computationally intensive problem. The speedup of run times afforded by parallel computing makes the difference between simply unacceptably long runs to obtain the results (e. g., several days or weeks) and practically feasible studies (<b>e.</b> g., <b>overnight</b> runs). The results also support the scheduling policy implemented, since they confirm that it is beneficial to use all eight cores of the two quad-core processors on each node simultaneously, giving us in-effect a computer that can run jobs efficiently with up to 656 parallel processes when using all 82 compute nodes. The cluster tara is an IBM server x iDataPlex purchased in 2009 by the UMBC High Performance Computing Facility (www. umbc. edu/hpcf). It is an 86 -node distributed-memory cluster comprised of 82 compute, 2 develop, 1 user and 1 management nodes. Each node features two quad-core Intel Nehalem X 5550 processors (2. 66 GHz, 8 MB cache), 24 GB memory, and a 120 GB local hard drive. All nodes and the 160 TB central storage are connected by an InfiniBand (QDR) interconnect network. ...|$|R
40|$|In certain conditions, {{members of}} the Lactobacillus genus are auxotrophs that have fastidious {{requirements}} for growth. Notably, Lactobacillus cannot grow in M 9 medium, a minimal synthetic medium used for Escherichia coli. However, we found that some Lactobacillus strains can be grown in M 9 when co-cultured with E. coli K- 12. In the co-culture, L. casei proliferates exponentially, reaching cell densities of 108 CFU (colony-forming unit) ml− 1 in 6 [*]h and dominating E. coli in the late growth phase. Spent medium from <b>E.</b> coli grown <b>overnight</b> lacked this growth-promoting effect on L. casei. Similarly, the effect was not observed when the species were separated by a 0. 4 -µm membrane. Microscopic observations showed that L. casei are embedded in the micro-scale clusters of E. coli in the early growth phase. This study describes {{for the first time}} the ability of a Lactobacillus species to grow in minimal medium when in close proximity with co-cultured bacteria...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel 3 D fibrin matrix model using recombinant {{hematopoietic stem cell}} cytokines under serum-free defined conditions which promotes the assembly of human endothelial cell (EC) tubes with co-associated pericytes. Individual ECs and pericytes are randomly mixed together and EC tubes form that is accompanied by pericyte recruitment to the EC tube abluminal surface over a 3 - 5 day period. These morphogenic processes are stimulated {{by a combination of}} the hematopoietic stem cell cytokines, stem cell factor, interleukin- 3, stromal derived factor- 1 α, and Flt- 3 ligand which are added in conjunction with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) - 2 into the fibrin matrix. In contrast, this tube morphogenic response does not occur under serum-free defined conditions when VEGF and FGF- 2 are added together in the fibrin matrices. We recently demonstrated that VEGF and FGF- 2 are able to prime EC tube morphogenic responses (i. <b>e.</b> added <b>overnight</b> prior to the morphogenic assay) to hematopoietic stem cell cytokines in collagen matrices and, interestingly, they also prime EC tube morphogenesis in 3 D fibrin matrices. EC-pericyte interactions in 3 D fibrin matrices leads to marked vascular basement membrane assembly as demonstrated using immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, we show that hematopoietic stem cell cytokines and pericytes stimulate EC sprouting in fibrin matrices in a manner dependent on the α 5 β 1 integrin. This novel co-culture system, under serum-free defined conditions, allows for a molecular analysis of EC tube assembly, pericyte recruitment and maturation events in a critical ECM environment (i. e. fibrin matrices) that regulates angiogenic events in postnatal life...|$|R
