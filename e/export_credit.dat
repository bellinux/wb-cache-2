5|$|MIGA's inaugural {{investment}} guarantees {{were issued}} in 1990 to cover $1.04billion ($1.83billion in 2012dollars) worth of foreign direct investment(FDI) comprising four individual projects. The agency also issued its first reinsurance contracts signed {{in collaboration with}} Export Development Canada and the United States' Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). That same year, MIGA held a conference in Ghana to promote investment. The agency joined the Berne Union, an international community of <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> and investment insurance providers in 1994. In 1997, MIGA issued the inaugural contract under its Cooperative Underwriting Program to support an energy project in Indonesia. In collaboration with the European Union Investment Trust Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the agency set up a fund for investment guarantees amounting to $12million ($17million in 2012dollars). The agency also established the West Bank and Gaza Investment Guarantee Trust Fund with a capacity of $20million ($29million in 2012dollars). In 1998 the Council of Governors of MIGA adopted a resolution establishing a general capital increase of $850million ($1.2billion in 2012dollars), and transferring a grant of $150million ($212million in 2012dollars) from the IBRD. MIGA exceeded $1billion ($1.4billion in 2012 dollars) in investment guarantees within a single {{year for the first}} time in 1999. The agency also approved an Environmental Assessment and Disclosure Policy and began attempting to implement such standards for new projects.|$|E

25|$|The {{case has}} been {{called one of the}} most {{important}} of the late 20th century, since it freed nationally chartered banks to offer credit cards to anyone in the U.S. they deemed qualified, and more specifically because it allowed them to <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> card interest rates to states with stricter regulations, opening up a race between states in an effort to attract lending institutions to set up shop in their states and offer a wider variety of consumer credit products. Over the next decade, the states accelerated a process that had already begun of repealing or loosening their anti-usury laws, allowing state-chartered banks to compete more equally with national ones. As a result, the use of credit cards has vastly increased, and since the mortgage industry soon followed suit, the issuance of subprime mortgages also increased drastically, facilitating the housing bubble that led to the 2008 housing crisis.|$|E

40|$|The recent WTO cotton ruling {{has led to}} a {{paradoxical}} result for the United States, a result that seems a textbook illustration of the "law of unintended consequences". Indeed, during the Uruguay Round negotiations of the present WTO agreements, the United States refused to put agricultural <b>export</b> <b>credits</b> in the category of agricultural export subsidies, where they would then have been subject only to reduction commitments. Paradoxically, the United States finds itself now in a position where these same agricultural <b>export</b> <b>credits</b> that it did not condescend to reduce during the Uruguay Round are openly considered as prohibited export subsidies.

Specialised insurers <b>Export</b> <b>Credit</b> Guarantee Corporation and Agriculture Insurance Company (AIC) offer credit guarantee and crop insurance, respectively.
