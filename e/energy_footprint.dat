40|$|Little {{was known}} {{at the start of}} these studies {{regarding}} the environmental impacts of bulk chemicals production from biomass and whether they could be produced economically. We have therefore analysed the entire life cycle of biomaterials: the production of bio-based chemicals, the application of bio-based polymers in packaging and finally the waste treatment of biodegradable materials. Numerous bio-based chemicals offer economic opportunities, the extent of which depends on the prices of the petrochemical and bio-based feedstocks and can be further improved by technological progress in the future (chapter 2). Almost all bio-based chemicals have lower carbon and <b>energy</b> <b>footprints</b> than their petrochemical counterparts, and savings can be substantially increased in the future (chapter 3). Bio-based materials also offer savings when used for a specific food packaging application, but these savings can become smaller when the comparison is made not per kg of material but considering the functionality and material properties (chapter 4). Biodegradable materials are advantageous in that they are suitable for biological waste treatment options whose carbon and <b>energy</b> <b>footprints</b> are currently at least equally good as incineration, but have the additional benefit of producing a soil conditioner which can improve soil carbon content (chapter 5). Finally, consistent policy measures supporting bio-based and/or biodegradable materials are necessary to ensure this market’s success (chapter 6). The progress made in terms of quantifying the benefits, the start of major research & development programmes and the start-up of production facilities have increased the likelihood for many bio-based chemicals and plastics to enter the market. So there are clear opportunities for biomaterials, but policy measures are needed to ensure that they can start competing on a larger scale...|$|R

40|$|Greenhouse gas {{emissions}} increased by 10. 8 Gigagram (Gg) CO 2 equivalent in 1990 − 2010. Significant {{attention has been}} dedicated to the increase in emission transfers due to international trade. However, questions remain unanswered about which key sectors are stimulating the increase of CO 2 emissions and whether changes in trade conditions have affected global emissions. To address the issue of increased emission transfers due to international trade, I used input-output tables (IOTs) in constant prices extended with CO 2 emissions to examine the development of China. I calculated marginal coefficients – in monetary and CO 2 terms – that capture the additional (new) technology installed after that year. My work provides a first overview of the magnitude and distribution of these coefficients in recent years across China’s rapidly growing economy for which marginal coefficients could be expected to differ greatly from average coefficients and are responsible for the substantial increase in CO 2 emissions. To answer the second question regarding which industries and trade conditions are stimulating the increase in CO 2 emissions, I first explore the countries and sectors recording an increase or decrease in <b>energy</b> <b>footprints</b> during the decades from 1990 - 2010. I then highlight the effect of international outsourcing of energy-intensive production processes by decomposing the structural and spatial change in <b>energy</b> <b>footprints.</b> This <b>energy</b> data is then further converted to CO 2 emission data to disintegrate total CO 2 emissions for each country into contributions from various driving forces acting on the domestic economy and international trade.

Some wool used to manufacture insulation is the wool discarded as waste by other industries due to its colour or grade. As a controlled waste product it cannot be disposed of until it is cleaned. Hence the <b>energy</b> <b>footprint</b> of washing the wool is attributed to the livestock industry under PAS2050. There are some primary environmental factors that need to be considered when looking for a source of wool, such as the way the flock is treated for pesticides, the chemicals used in the treatment of the wool after shearing, and the distance from the source to its final destination. Sheep are often treated with insecticide and fungicide in a process called dipping. This leaves a residue on the fleece and can result in groundwater contamination if used improperly. These residues are often washed off once the fleece is sheared, but this results in three byproducts, grease, liquor, and sludge. The first two can be safely disposed of, but the latter contains remnants of the pesticides which cause a concern for disposal.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of global value chains on energy {{footprints}}. Energy footprints are consumption-based indicators which record the energy used to produce a country's final demand. In order to disentangle key characteristics of global value chains and their effects on the global <b>energy</b> <b>footprint,</b> we employ structural decomposition analyses (SDA). Furthermore, the analysis combines a retrospective with a prospective SDA approach. After {{an analysis of the}} global <b>energy</b> <b>footprint</b> for the period between 1995 and 2009, we discuss three scenarios of international integration and their implications for energy footprints for the period from 2009 to 2030. Our results show that the global <b>energy</b> <b>footprint</b> has increased by 29. 4 % from 1995 to 2009, and the scenarios indicate that it will increase by another 23. 5 % until 2030. Economic activity is the most important driver for the increase in energy footprints. Rising final demand alone would have increased the global <b>energy</b> <b>footprint</b> by 47. 0 % between 1995 and 2009. The composition of countries from where consumption and investment goods come adds another 12. 6 %. Sectoral energy intensity reductions are the most important decelerator of energy use (- 27. 8 %). There is a substantial contribution of changing global value chains on the rise in the global <b>energy</b> <b>footprint</b> (7. 5 %) : Stronger backward linkages in global value chains increased the global <b>energy</b> <b>footprint</b> by 5. 5 % between 1995 and 2009.

The shift of the world economy towards East Asia alone would have increased the global <b>energy</b> <b>footprint</b> by 3. 0 %.

Industries that have already spent many years in improving energy efficiency now find it difficult to propose and implement additional improvement measures. This thesis proposes a way to identify potential areas for improvements in energy efficiency by calculating <b>energy</b> <b>footprint</b> of the manufacturing assets. The information on <b>energy</b> <b>footprint</b> is provided using analytic tools. The main goal of the thesis is to demonstrate how <b>energy</b> <b>footprint</b> can help in making decisions regarding the manufacturing facility that may lead to improvement in the overall energy efficiency of the system. For purpose of energy data analysis, a methodology is proposed in which the analytic tools are developed as web services. This methodology is suitable for implementation within a service-oriented manufacturing facility. The core analysis of data is carried out using MATLAB due to its powerful data analysis capabilities, high level programming, availability of relevant libraries, easiness in data handling and manipulation. MATLAB functionalities are deployed in Java and are published as web services. The classes in Java are mainly responsible for message parsing and sending/receiving data from MATLAB functions deployed in Java. The work demonstrates the usefulness of analytic tools in analyzing <b>energy</b> <b>footprint</b> of manufacturing assets.
