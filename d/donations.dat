We also discuss whether current practices that are used for increasing <b>donation</b> are ethical or not, such as investing effort and resources for certain types of haemato­poietic stem cell banks, payment for <b>donation,</b> advertising and directed <b>donation.</b> We conclude with some recommendations for moving forward the debate on this field and promoting ethical practices within the field of haematopoietic stem cell <b>donation</b> not only in the Swiss context but potentially applicable worldwide...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBACKGROUNDA {{range of}} socio-demographic, organizational, {{physiological}} and psychological factors may influence peoples’ willingness to donate blood. Education had {{positive influence on}} attitudes towards blood <b>donation</b> as well as blood donors’ satisfaction to the time and location of <b>donation.</b> The most common misconceptions about blood <b>donation</b> were the risk of infection; selling donated blood to patients, and that blood <b>donation</b> believed to cause physical weakness. AIMSThis paper is a report of a study of blood <b>donation</b> knowledge, attitudes and barriers. The aims {{of the study were}} to determine: (1) Jordanian blood donors’ level of knowledge of blood <b>donation.</b> (2) Jordanian blood donors’ attitudes towards <b>donation.</b> (3) Barriers influence blood <b>donation</b> in Jordan. METHODSA cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data from 500 blood donors between August 2011 and November 2011 using self-reported questionnaire. RESULTSRelatively inadequate knowledge about blood <b>donation</b> was found as only 28. 6 % of participants scored their knowledge above the average. Friends, encouraging media, and religion were influential factors affecting their knowledge and attitudes related to blood <b>donation.</b> CONCLUSIONSince educational programs about blood <b>donation</b> are not frequently used in Jordan, {{there is a need to}} emphasize education as a key to improve population knowledge and attitudes towards blood <b>donation...</b>|$|R

Approximately $10 million of contributions came from Saudi Arabia. However, the Clinton Foundation declined to release a full donor list, similar to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library (although the foundation later agreed to disclose the top 150 donors to the House Government Reform Committee). <b>Donations</b> exceeding $1 million were also given from various other foreign governments (such as Kuwait and Taiwan), as well as foreign individuals.

Using a sample of 409 participants, the current study sought to develop a profile of Australian adults who had communicated their organ <b>donation</b> wishes to family members. Christian participants and those who had a higher income {{were more likely to have}} communicated their <b>donation</b> wishes. Conversely, participants were less likely to have communicated their <b>donation</b> wishes if they were unregistered and undecided/opposed to organ <b>donation,</b> unregistered but willing to donate, or fearful of death. Finally, whether participants had communicated, registered, or communicated and registered their <b>donation</b> wishes was associated with their age, religion, attitude toward organ <b>donation,</b> and recall of media content about organ <b>donation.</b> Messages encouraging the communication of organ <b>donation</b> wishes to family members should therefore be targeted toward those individuals who are most likely to be receptive toward enacting this behavior...|$|R
