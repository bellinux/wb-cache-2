Joining forces, the two take out several of Drek's operations one-by-one while gathering gradual information on his plans. This move enrages Drek, who subsequently launches a manhunt for the duo.|$|E

He initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first full-scale humanoid <b>intelligent</b> <b>robot.</b> WABOT-1 had two arms, walked on two legs, and sees with two camera eyes.

This position paper explores this potential, with initial support from an effort underway to develop a graphical architecture that is based on factor graphs (with piecewise continuous functions). Robots require a close coupling of (multiple forms of) perception and action. <b>Intelligent</b> <b>robots</b> go beyond this to require a further coupling with cognition.
