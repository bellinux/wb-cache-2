5|$|I never agreed, {{even as a}} young person, {{with the}} Thomas Wolfe title You Can't Go Home Again. Instinctively I didn’t. But the truth is, you can never leave home. You take it with you; it’s under your fingernails; it’s <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicles; it’s {{in the way you}} smile; it’s in the ride of your hips, in the passage of your breasts; it’s all there, no matter where you go. You can take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even learn to speak their ways. But the truth is, home is between your teeth.|$|E
5|$|Lindow Man and LindowIII {{were found}} to have {{elevated}} levels of copper on their skin. The cause for this was uncertain as there could have been natural causes, although a study by Pyatt et al. proposed that the bodies may have been painted with a copper-based pigment. To test this, skin samples were taken from places likely to be painted and tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely. It was found that the copper content of the skin of the torso was higher than the control areas, suggesting that the theory of Pyatt et al. may have been correct. However, the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall content was above that expected of a male, and variations across the body may have been due to environmental factors. Similarly, green deposits were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair,</b> originally thought to be a copper-based pigment used for decoration, but it was later found {{to be the result of}} a reaction between the keratin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> and the acid of the peat bog.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} pathologic {{change is}} {{the formation of a}} plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle. In normal skin, the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of the hair follicle. However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the hair follicle. If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).|$|E

5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicle, stemcells {{reside in}} a {{discrete}} microenvironment called the bulge, {{located at the}} base of the part of the follicle that is established during morphogenesis but does not degenerate during the hair cycle. The bulge contains multipotent stemcells that can be recruited during wound healing to help the repair of the epidermis.|$|E
25|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{involves a}} change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> cycle. There are three {{stages of the}} hair cycle: the anagen phase (hair growth), the catagen phase (hair follicle death), and the telogen phase (hair shedding). If the anagen phase increases beyond what is normal; that region of the body will experience excessive hair growth.|$|E

25|$|The {{action of}} Asip can be {{observed}} in horses which have their winter coats clipped. When shaved close, the black tip is shorn off leaving the phaeomelanic bottom of the shaft.

This is not usually seen in dark bays, which have little red <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> shaft.|$|E

25|$|If a horse {{does not}} possess a functional, {{dominant}} {{copy of the}} wildtype E-allele at the Extension locus, then Mc1r cannot be produced.

25|$|D. folliculorum is a semi-transparent, {{elongated}} organism {{consisting of}} a head, neck, body, and tail. D. folliculorum is worm-like, with tiny claws, and scales over their entire body which allows it to anchor itself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> follicles. As an adult, D. folliculorum can measure 0.1mm to 0.4mm in length and possess four pairs of short legs near its head and neck region. However, as a larva and/or nymph, D. folliculorum resembles the adult but has three pairs of short legs near its head and neck region. The body and tail region of D. folliculorum is striated.|$|E
50|$|Two of {{the active}} {{ingredients}} are calcium hydroxide (lime) and sodium hydroxide (lye), which raise <b>the</b> pH of <b>hair,</b> chemically breaking it down. Some formulations also contain potassium thioglycolate, which breaks down <b>the</b> disulphide bonds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair's</b> keratin thus weakening it enough to be simply wiped away. Products such as Nair often combine softening agents such as mineral oil to help offset the harsh active ingredients.|$|R

25|$|Silk is {{described}} in a chapter on mulberry planting by Si Shengzhi of the Western Han (206 BC – 9 AD). There is a surviving calendar for silk production in an Eastern Han (25–220 AD) document. The two other known works on silk from the Han period are lost. The first evidence of the long distance silk trade is the finding of silk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> of an Egyptian mummy of the 21st dynasty, c.1070 BC. The silk trade reached {{as far as the}} Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, Europe, and North Africa.

Billy's next stop is Wembley Stadium and again he discovers the torchbearers have already left.

25|$|Despite {{the almost}} {{universal}} assumption to the contrary, the wastewater treatment facilities installed in December 1959 {{had no effect}} on the level of organic mercury being released into the Shiranui Sea. The pollution and the disease it caused continued to spread. The Kumamoto and Kagoshima prefectural governments conducted a joint survey in late 1960 and early 1961 into the level of mercury <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hair</b> of people living around the Shiranui Sea. The results confirmed that organic mercury had spread all around the inland sea and that people were still being poisoned by contaminated fish. Hundreds of people were discovered to have levels greater than 50 ppm of mercury in their hair, the level at which people are likely to experience nerve damage. The highest result recorded was that of a woman from Goshonoura island who had 920 ppm in her sample.|$|E
