40|$|The {{discounted}} {{cash flow}} or net present value model in the corporate valuation and decision-making has defects because of un-flexibility. The real options model gets over these faults because it can deal with uncertainty in the corporate business process. The representative real option model is the Black-Scholes model and binominal model. The most important characteristic of real option model is the flexible valuation of assets and corporation. The functions of the model on basing this characteristic are that it can evaluate real and accurate corporate value and make precise and flexible decisions in each step of business situations. The real option value may become a general valuation standard and this accounting has possibility to become a <b>general</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

But there are two kind of current value accounting system. The one is the current cost accounting {{and the other is}} the sale value accounting. The former has many faults and the latter has many advantages from the viewpoint of the accounting logic and theory. Therefore the cash flow accounting should combine the sale value accounting and I named this accounting system as the integrated sale value accounting. This accounting system has three characteristics of (1) cash generation ability oriented, (2) decision making oriented and (3) representation of the real world and has many pragmatic, semantic and syntactic advantages. The integrated sale value accounting is the best accounting system in theory and practice, therefore we should refine this accounting system in the future...|$|E

But once the cash flow statements and cash flow accounting are generated, they are incorporated into the double entry bookkeeping system and integrated into the <b>general</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>system.</b> In that system, the purpose of accounting is to grasp the corporate economic activities and fund movements in totality and the important statements are the trial balance of totals and trial balance of balances. The cash flow statements, income statements and balance sheets are derived from those trial balances. In that sense, the former means a flow statement of general fund and the latter means a stock statement of general fund.

40|$|According to the 1993 SNA and 1995 ESA recommendations, {{the annual}} Supply-Use Tables {{need to be}} {{compiled}} at both current and constant prices by the National Institutes of Statistics. The most appropriate way to obtain consistent Supply-Use Tables at both current and constant prices is to balance them simultaneously. The main complexity in balancing Supply-Use Tables and any other <b>general</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>system</b> simultaneously at both current and constant prices is the nonlinearity that inevitably occurs. Some attempts {{to solve the problem}} which are described in the literature are mainly based on the transformation of variables and definition of suitable matrices of variances and covariances of the system. In this paper, a suitable method is proposed to balance an extremely large set of National Accounts simultaneously at current and constant prices through the definition of a new procedure based on the predictor-corrector method. The distinctive features of the proposed balancing method are its flexibility, which is very high compared to the other methods in the literature, and its capability to allow the control of the consistency of the system of deflators.

40|$|Decomposition {{techniques}} in the input-output analysis are traditionally {{based on the}} assumption that the elasticity of price-induced input substitution is either zero (the Leontief assumption) or equal to one (the Cobb-Douglas and Klein-Morishima assumption). Sectoral differences in quantities or prices that are observed over time or across space are accordingly decomposed into direct and indirect input-quantity or input-price components and technological change effects. Since the empirical results may depend significantly on the underlying hypothesis on price-induced input substitution, the paper is aimed at extending the traditional input-output model to a more general production system that is compatible with all possible values of elasticities of substitution. Assuming quadratic polynomial functional forms of sectoral cost functions, a more <b>general</b> input-output <b>accounting</b> <b>system</b> can be developed. In this paper, the traditional input-output model is implicitly extended to the case of Translog cost functions by using TÃ¶rnqvist index numbers in interspatial and intertemporal comparisons of relative price levels and their components. A new decomposition procedure is derived and applied empirically. The results are compared with those obtained by using the traditional input-output decomposition procedures. ...|$|R

5000|$|Job Costing is {{the process}} of {{determining}} the labor and materials cost for each job in a systematic way, and then using this information to create a quote for the customer. Job costing or cost accounting can be used in virtually any industry (especially service industry) to ensure that the product pricing covers actual costs, overhead and provides a profit. The purpose of any business is to make money, and job costing is {{the most effective way to}} ensure that occurs.In a job costing system, costs may be accumulated either by job or by batch. For a typical job, direct material, labor, subcontract costs, equipment, and other direct costs are tracked at their actual values. These are accrued until the job or batch is completed. Overhead or [...] "burden" [...] may be applied either by using a rate based on direct labor hours or by using some other Activity Based Costing (ABC) cost driver. In either case, once overhead/burden is added, the total cost for the job can be determined. If the accountant is using a <b>general</b> ledger <b>accounting</b> <b>system,</b> which lacks true job costing functionality, the costs must be manually transferred out of Work in Process to Finished Goods (Cost of Goods Sold for service industries). Of course, in the days of computerized job costing software, journaling costs manually is an obsolete process. Such hand-journaling is mandatory for companies that continue to use <b>general</b> <b>accounting</b> software to do job costing. Enlightened accountants are moving forward and using job costing software, thereby improving cost control, reducing risk, and increasing the chance of profitability.|$|R
40|$|Most {{producers}} face a {{wide range}} of financial decision making problems and consequently can potentially make effective use of the many different computer based financial analysis packages available. Examples include transaction recording and analysis packages (e. g. Shanon and Robertson's Saltbush <b>General</b> <b>Accounting</b> <b>System,</b> the Kellogg Farm Management Unit's Financial Recording System), budgeting systems (e. g. Etherington, 1981; Nuthall, 1984; Mill and Longworth, 1975), whole property linear programming based decision models (e. g. Kletke et aI, 1975), fertilizer application models (e. g. Ross, 1978), machinery decisions (e. g. Brown and Schoney, 1985) and payroll packages (of which there are a range available). Despite this wide range, however, most producers are primarily interested in financial recording and budgeting systems. This has been borne out by the many surveys of computer owning producers. When asked the major reasons for using a computer, Oliver (1985) found computer users responded with financial management {{at the top of their}} list. These responses would be anticipated as ongoing decisions must be made in the financial management and cash flow forecasting areas whereas decisions on, for example, enterprise selection, machinery replacement, fertilizer levels and land purchase, all occur infrequently and are often more cost effectively handled using pencil and paper methods rather than through expensive on farm computer packages. For these reasons, this paper concentrates on reviewing financial budgeting and recording. Financial recording practices have always been of major interest. One of the first computerised systems was the mail in accounting system operated by Michigan State University (see Eisgruber, 1975). These financial packages have flourished now that microcomputers are available despite the scepticism of the early critics (e. g. Hardaker and Anderson, 1981; Nuthall, 1982). The Michigan system actually commenced around 1975 using pencil and paper methods and was eventually computerised. The next major move was into linear programming systems around 1968 (see Candler, 1970; also Baker, 1970) but these systems have never proved to be popular. No doubt this has been partly due to attempting to use sophisticated systems before producers are familiar with basic recording packages. As microcomputers become more extensively used and managers that have had an early exposure to these management aid machines at school and tertiary levels move through the community, this situation may change, particularly as the software becomes easier to use. Indeed, the opportunities to provide significant assistance to managers through advanced software provides an exciting and challenging future for farm management computer professional teams. The era in which office management has a machine akin to equipment like tractors, milking and shearing machines is rapidly approaching. With this in mind this paper contains a discussion on financial budgeting and recording systems with a view to providing the means to evaluate packages currently available. The comments made are based on many years experience of working with farmers and computers, and more latterly, the experience gained by members of the Kellogg Farm Management Unit based at Lincoln College. (The Unit's objective is to develop and support computer based management aids (supplied throughout Australasia).) Topics covered include the place of budgeting and recording in management, the requirements of good budgeting and financial recording packages, the need for integration between systems, the importance of proper support and education as well as the benefits attainable from using integrated packages. Comments are also offered on the development and maintenance of successful packages as well as the need for a consumer service. Finally some thoughts about the future form of financial packages are provided...|$|E
