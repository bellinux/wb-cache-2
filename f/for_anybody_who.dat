25|$|The {{remains of}} the vessel provide a {{haunting}} and fascinating dive <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> ventures onto the site, the large boilers and {{remains of the}} bow and stern also create a unique and interesting dive. The remains are such that one only has to have little knowledge of the vessel to understand what features are present. On top of this, the site is significant simply as a dive site, the abundance of marine life that are present and the features provide a wonderful and popular dive.|$|E
25|$|Presently {{there are}} still {{considerable}} remains of the Clan Ranald left on the site. Almost the entire hull has collapsed, except for a portion that is held up by the port side boiler. The double hulled bottom of the bow is standing vertical and the bow section has collapsed forwards and downwards into two parts. There are still enormous boilers that remain on site, approximately 2-3 {{times the size of}} a diver and provide a spectacular site <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> visits the site and the port main boiler has rolled out and is free of the hull remains. Underneath the collapsed hull, the engine still remains relatively intact.|$|E

I don't wanna hear it! I'm gonna move ON!'...

Anthony added that he concentrated on the attention of detail in his line, which he said is <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who's</b> into [...] "great quality clothes at a cheap price point".|$|R
25|$|Electromechanical {{broadcasts}} {{began in}} Germany in 1929, but were without sound until 1934. Network electronic service started on March 22, 1935, on 180 lines using telecine transmission of film, intermediate film system, or cameras using the Nipkow Disk. Transmissions using cameras {{based on the}} iconoscope began on January 15, 1936. The Berlin Summer Olympic Games were televised, using both all-electronic iconoscope-based cameras and intermediate film cameras, to Berlin and Hamburg in August 1936. Twenty-eight public television rooms were opened <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> did not own a television set. The Germans had a 441-line system {{on the air in}} February 1937, and during World War II brought it to France, where they broadcast from the Eiffel Tower.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Empire Windrush, {{which was}} en route from Australia to England via the Atlantic, docked in Kingston, Jamaica, to pick {{servicemen}} who were on leave. The British Nationality Act 1948 had just been passed, giving the status of citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC status) to all British subjects connected with the United Kingdom or a British colony. Prior to 1962, the UK had no immigration control for CUKCs, who could settle indefinitely in the UK without restrictions. The ship was far from full, and so an opportunistic advertisement {{was placed in a}} Jamaican newspaper offering cheap transport on the ship <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> wanted to come and work in the UK. Many former servicemen took this opportunity to return to Britain with the hopes of rejoining the RAF, while others decided to make the journey just to see what England was like. The resulting group of 492 immigrants famously began a wave of migration from the Caribbean to the UK when the ship docked at the Port of Tilbury, near London, on 22 June 1948, and the name Windrush has as a result come to be used as shorthand for that migration, and by extension for the beginning of modern British multicultural society.|$|E

500|$|To {{what extent}} bookwheels were {{appreciated}} for their convenience versus their aesthetic qualities remains {{a matter of}} speculation according to modern American engineer Henry Petroski. Ramelli himself described the bookwheel as a [...] "beautiful and ingenious machine, very useful and convenient <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> takes pleasure in study, especially {{for those who are}} indisposed and tormented by gout." [...] Ramelli's reference to gout, a condition that impairs mobility, demonstrates the appeal of a device that allows access to several books while seated. However, Petroski notes that Ramelli's illustration lacks space for writing and other scholarly work, and that the [...] "fanciful wheel" [...] may not have been appropriate for any activity beyond reading.|$|E

Many considered the Body Count performances to be {{the highlight of the}} tour. The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album O.G. Original Gangster. The song [...] "Body Count" [...] was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a [...] "black hardcore band," [...] stating that [...] "as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, R & B, or all that kind of stuff. I just look at it as music.

In 1596, the States-General offered a high reward <b>for</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> successfully navigated the Northeast Passage. The Town Council of Amsterdam purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by Jan Rijp and Jacob van Heemskerk, {{to search for the}} elusive channel, under the command of Barents. They set off on May, and on June discovered Bear Island and Spitsbergen, sighting its northwest coast. They saw a large bay, later called Raudfjorden and entered Magdalenefjorden, which they named Tusk Bay, sailing into the northern entrance of Forlandsundet, which they called Keerwyck, but were forced to turn back because of a shoal. On 28 June they rounded the northern point of Prins Karls Forland, which they named Vogelhoek, on account of the large number of birds, and sailed south, passing Isfjorden and Bellsund, which were labelled on Barentsz's chart as Grooten Inwyck and Inwyck.|$|E

Many only intended to stay in Britain for a few years, and although a number returned to the Caribbean, the majority remained to settle permanently.
