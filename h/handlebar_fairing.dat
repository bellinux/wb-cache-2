5000|$|The [...] "C" [...] {{designation}} {{models were}} introduced in 1983 and were mechanically similar but the machine now had a sports <b>handlebar</b> <b>fairing</b> and a rear grab-handle {{in place of the}} previous sport tail. The [...] "C" [...] version remained in production (with only minor - mainly cosmetic - changes) {{for the remainder of the}} production run. There was a related AE model which was an off-road or [...] "Enduro" [...] style machine with cycle style spoke wheels, rather than the five spoke cast wheels of the AR models.|$|E
50|$|Black Knight and Black Prince {{versions}} were innovative {{in using}} full enclosure and weather protection, with glass fibre panels that included leg shields and a <b>handlebar</b> <b>fairing.</b> This {{was not about}} streamlining for speed, as the fairings reduced top speed by 10 mph, although the Vincent was already powerful enough for riders of the day - it was instead {{about the idea that}} the rider could travel to work in a suit rather than full motorcycle kit. Care was taken to ensure that the engine was still easily accessible for general maintenance, and the rear enclosure was hinged to provide access to the rear wheel and drive chain.|$|E
50|$|Falling {{sales of}} the Series C Vincent {{motorcycles}} during 1952 and 1953 was partly attributed to dated styling, so Phil Vincent sought to update the range and development began what were to become the Series D machines. The main change was innovative full enclosure and weather protection, with glass fibre panels that included leg shields and a <b>handlebar</b> <b>fairing.</b> This was not about streamlining for speed, as the Vincent was already powerful enough for riders of the day - it was instead {{about the idea that}} the rider could travel to work in a suit rather than full motorcycle kit.

50|$|New for 2010, the Victory Cross Country Motorcycle is a hard-bagger cruiser with a <b>handlebar</b> mounted <b>fairing.</b> It has a Freedom V-Twin Engine, 21 {{gallons of}} cargo capacity, 4.7 inches of {{suspension}} travel, floorboards, cruise control and an MP3-compatible sound system.|$|R
50|$|In its {{original}} incarnation launched in 1983, the XJ900 had an air-cooled, double overhead camshaft, 853 cc 4-stroke, 4-cylinder, 8-valve engine. Originally {{fitted with a}} <b>handlebar</b> mounted bikini <b>fairing,</b> its handling came in for criticism. This was quickly replaced with a frame mounted upper fairing and retrofitted to all models. The 1983 XJ900 came with anti-dive front forks, shaft drive and has triple disc brakes (2 front, 1 rear).|$|R
50|$|The Kawasaki GPz750 was a sport bike {{introduced}} by Kawasaki in 1982. It {{was more than}} a warmed-over KZ750, as it was improved in many areas, focusing on high-performance. Changes started at the front, with tapered bearings in the steering head instead of the KZ750's ball bearings, and the upper triple clamp was changed also, giving the GPz solid aluminum clip-on handle grips instead of the traditional <b>handlebar.</b> A bikini <b>fairing</b> almost identical to the one on the GPz550 was added too. The GPz750 boasted increased power, with slightly higher compression, and camshafts designed to get the valves to full lift quicker, and fitting Mikuni 34mm carburetors to it for smoother airflow. The cylinder heads were also given a new combustion chamber with a 'squish zone' and porting & polishing from the factory. To maintain reliability oil passages were installed under the pistons for increased cooling, and an oil-cooler was added. The GPz750 was the quickest factory 750, as Cycle World recorded a time of 11.93 seconds at 109.62 mph in the 1/4 mile. The GPz750 underwent some significant changes in 1983. The original was based on the 1981 KZ750-E. Kawasaki retired the KZ750 after 1983. The 1983 KZ750L3 was nearly identical to the '82 GPz750, but for different colors, no bikini fairing, and without the porting & polishing in the cylinder head.|$|R
