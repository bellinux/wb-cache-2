5|$|As {{co-chair}} of the House Hunger Caucus, McGovern is an advocate for expanding child nutrition programs both domestically and internationally. In 2007 McGovern obtained $840 million in required funding for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program in the House version of the <b>farm</b> <b>bill.</b> The House–Senate conference committee stripped most of the funding from the final bill.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the <b>farm</b> <b>bill</b> if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E

25|$|From its {{inception}} as a farming community, Davis {{has been known}} for its contributions to agricultural policy along with veterinary care and animal husbandry. Following the passage of the University <b>Farm</b> <b>Bill</b> in 1905 by the California State Legislature, Governor George Pardee selected Davis out of 50 other sites as the future home to the University of California's University Farm, officially opening to students in 1908. The farm, later renamed the Northern Branch of the College of Agriculture in 1922, was upgraded into the seventh UC general campus, the University of California, Davis, in 1959.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 <b>Farm</b> <b>Bill</b> {{authorized}} $20 {{million to}} be spent on pilot projects to determine whether incentives provided to SNAP recipients at the point-of-sale would increase the purchase of fruits, vegetables, or other healthful foods. Fifteen states expressed interest in having the pilot program and, ultimately, five states submitted applications to be considered for HIP. Hampden County, Massachusetts was selected as the Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP) site. HIP is designed to take place from August 2010 to April 2013 with the actual operation phase of the pilot program scheduled to last 15 months, from November 2011 to January 2013.|$|E
25|$|On April 19, 2013, Kentucky legalized Hemp when Governor Steve Beshear {{refused to}} sign or veto Senate Bill 50, {{allowing}} the state law to go into effect. Beshear {{had been one of}} the last obstacles blocking SB50 from becoming law. Under federal law, hemp is a Schedule 1 narcotic, just like PCP and heroin, in spite of the fact that hemp typically only has 0.3 percent THC, compared to the three percent to 22 percent usually found in marijuana. The Schedule 1 designation was exempted for Kentucky's pilot hemp research projects when the federal <b>Farm</b> <b>Bill</b> (a.k.a. The Agricultural Act of 2014) was passed.|$|E

40|$|This {{publication}} {{began as}} {{a need for a}} short summary of farm programs and <b>farm</b> <b>bills</b> for two agricultural economics courses focusing on agricultural policy [...] ag. economics 429, and ag. economics 614. Over time, it became clear that many students taking these courses had less and less background in agriculture and less (even cursory) knowledge of policies than those of the recent past. After this list was developed, a number of other professional agricultural economists found copies and began to use it, hence its publication in a more structured form. The list of Farm Program Provisions is not all-inclusive. It certainly does not contain all the laws and provisions that have affected agriculture over the years. However, it is an easy reference to <b>farm</b> <b>bills</b> and provisions since 1933. We intend to update this list as time goes on to continue its usefulness to professionals and students alike.
