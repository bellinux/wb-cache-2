25|$|When {{enemies are}} defeated, they drop useful {{items for the}} player, such as Blood Vials, which are used as healing potions, or Quicksilver Bullets, the main {{ammunition}} for ranged weaponry. Players can also sacrifice health to create Blood Bullets for their ranged weaponry. Blood Bullets cause slightly more damage than standard Quicksilver Bullets and the Rally system still applies to the lost health.

The items hidden in the environment usually require the player to go on a <b>different</b> <b>path</b> <b>than</b> the path they were initially traveling. Other items the player may find include various forms of Coldblood, which grant the player Blood Echoes when consumed, Antidotes, used to cure poisoning, and Hunter Badges, items that allows the player to purchase more items in the Hunter's Dream.

50|$|Because {{of these}} shortcomings, it was {{necessary}} to move outside cognitive science-based HCI to find or develop the necessary theoretical platform. European psychology had taken <b>different</b> <b>paths</b> <b>than</b> had American with much inspiration from dialectical materialism (Hydén 1981, Engeström, 1987). Philosophers such as Heidegger and Wittgenstein came to play an important role, primarily through discussions of the limitations of AI (Winograd & Flores 1986, Dreyfus & Dreyfus 1986). Suchman (1987) with a similar focus introduced ethnomethodology into the discussions, and Ehn (1988) based his treatise of design of computer artifacts on Marx, Heidegger and Wittgenstein.The development of the activity theoretical angle was primarily carried out by Bødker (1991, 1996) and by Kuutti (Bannon & Kuutti, 1993, Kuutti, 1991, 1996), both with strong inspiration from Scandinavian activity theory groups in psychology. Bannon (1990, 1991) and Grudin (1990a and b) made significant contributions to the furthering of the approach by making it available to the HCI audience. The work of Kaptelinin (1996) has been important to connect to the earlier development of activity theory in Russia. Nardi produced the, hitherto, most applicable collection of activity theoretical HCI literature (Nardi, 1996).|$|R

40|$|Starring in {{the sixteenth}} century, a new {{interest}} in Oriental languages arose in Europe, and in particular an interest in Arabic. This interest in Arabic stemmed from the textual study of the Bible, which so absorted Eropean scholars {{in the age of}} the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. This is, then, an early "Orientalism" that has little to do with colonial enterprises, and follows <b>different</b> <b>paths</b> <b>than</b> those outlined by Said in his famous book Orientalism. It has traditionally been argued that Spain played no part in forming this Orientalist knowledge. In fact, from its European contemporaries of the sisteenth century down to the historiography of the twentieth century, Spain was essentially held to be an Oriental country itself, and therefore more of an object of "Orientalism" than an actual producer of Orientalist learning. This paper focus on these two assumptions by examining the situation of the study of Arabic in Spain, and showing how in Spain Arabic scholars were immersed in a very specific context and in an ideological debate in which the role of the Arabic language was a crucial one.

40|$|Abstract. Kinematic and {{isentropic}} trajectories {{are compared}} quantitatively during a single 5 -day period (October 13 - 18, 1992) when several flights for the Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry Near the Equator [...] Atlantic (TRACE A) experiment were conducted off {{the west coast}} of Africa. European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) data are used to compute the 5 -day backward trajectories arriving at locations over the South Atlantic Ocean and nearby parts of South America and southern Africa. Two versions of kinematic trajectories are examined. One version employs vertical motions supplied with the ECMWF data. These trajectories often differ greatly from those based on the isentropic assumption. The kinematic trajectories usually undergo considerably greater vertical displacements than their isentropic counterparts; however, most diabatic rates are consistent with those of synoptic-scale systems. Ratios of acetylene to carbon monoxide are related to backward trajectories at various locations along a TRACE A flight. A second version of kinematic trajectories employs vertical motions diagnosed from ECMWF horizontal wind components using the continuity equation. These vertical motions are stronger than those supplied with the ECMWF data, causing many of the trajectories to have larger vertical displacements and considerably <b>different</b> <b>paths</b> <b>than</b> the original kinematic versions. Many of these kinematic trajectories undergo diabatic rates that exceed generally accepted values on the synoptic scale. This occurs, in part, because the diagnosed vertical motions are inconsistent with the ECMWF data. The research indicates that the kinematic procedure yields realistic 5 -day backward trajectories when the three-dimensional wind data are available from a numerical model or other dynamically consistent data set such as provided by ECMWF. 1...|$|R

Although my interests might change during the programme or expand or intensify in a specific way, the starting point for work will be those areas of interest outlined above. My main method of working is in series form. Each image has. ? relationship to the others and is strengthened and intensified by this relationship. By using series I can create a story line which can be read, one image leading onto the next in a narrative/visual way or by a group of images creating a total image with cross-references. Some images have only hints {{of what is going on}} which encourages the viewer to interpret the works themselves. I plan to use infa-red images because of their particular qualities which are suited to the works I am dealing with. The images process a slight distortion tonally and spatially and are enhanced by the graininess, softness and lack of contrast in the film. Having spent the past two years working fairly consistently I found I have worked along <b>different</b> <b>paths</b> <b>than</b> those originally intended. After a period of settling back into an institution and the course, and of gaining confidence in myself and my work, my interests changed. My dissatisfaction with the mechanical and precious nature of photography led to the use of a simpler camera, a greater manipulation of images and the introduction of materials other than mount board and frame for presentation.
