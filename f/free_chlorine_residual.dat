40|$|A {{survey of}} 100 {{swimming}} pools {{has been conducted}} to assess the effectiveness of disinfection practices against various microorganisms and to check compliance with recommended chlorine levels and pH. Microbiological quality was assessed from densities of total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, total colony counts, and {{the presence or absence}} of amoebae, including the pathogen Naegleria fowleri. Although a <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> of 1. 0 mg/liter and a pH range of 7. 0 to 7. 6 are recommended by local health authorities, 41 pools had a lower <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> and 37 had a pH outside this range. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to test the association of field measurements with the microbiological data. The analysis demonstrated a strong positive association of free chlorine with bacteriological quality and the absence of Naegleria spp. No other field measurement was predictive in this regard, although the absence of all amoebae was associated with a relatively low water temperature and pH. Using a mathematical model derived from this analysis, it was estimated that 99 % of pools would have acceptable bacteriological quality and 94 % would be free of Naegleria spp. at a <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> of 1. 0 mg/liter. However, at the mean water temperature (23 degrees C) and pH (7. 5) seen in this study, other amoebae would still be detectable in 500 -ml samples taken from 40 % of pools at this chlorine level...|$|E
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of {{coliform bacteria}} and bacterial pathogens to <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> was determined {{before and after}} incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa.

Cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. Qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> was also assessed. Protozoa were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> that killed free-living bacteria. Ingested coliforms Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella sonnei, Legionella gormanii, and Campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals.</b> Bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99 % inactivation of free-living cells. All bacterial pathogens were greater than 50 -fold more resistant to <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> when ingested by T. pyriformis. Escherichia coli ingested by a Cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to <b>free</b> <b>chlorine.</b> The mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within protozoan cells. This study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. This bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> {{which can lead to}} persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. We propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluated}} trends for iron and manganese concentrations in wells, reservoirs, and water distribution networks in Qom city {{during the summer}} of 2012. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. The studied scopes consisted of groundwater (60 wells), reservoirs (10 tanks), and water distribution network (33 points). One sample was taken from each source monthly. Statistical tests used included post hoc tests (Tukey HSD). Finally, the results were compared with drinking water standards. Results: The average concentrations of iron in groundwater, reservoirs, and distribution networks were 0. 09, 0. 07, and 0. 07 mg/l, respectively. The average concentrations of manganese in groundwater, reservoirs, and distribution networks were 0. 15, 0. 09, and 0. 1 mg/l, respectively. The turbidity averages in groundwater, reservoirs, and distribution networks were 0. 58, 0. 6, and 0. 52 NTU, respectively. The average concentrations of <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> in water reservoirs and distribution networks were 1. 74 and 1. 06 mg/l, respectively. The pH averages in groundwater, reservoirs, and distribution networks were 7. 4, 7. 7, and 7. 5, respectively. The amounts of iron, manganese, turbidity, <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual,</b> and pH in the investigated resources had no significant differences (P > 0. 05). Conclusion: The amounts of iron, manganese, turbidity, <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> and pH in groundwater, reservoirs, and water distribution networks of Qom are within permissible limits of national standards and EPA guidelines.

40|$|A {{critical}} component in commercial poultry production {{is to ensure}} birds are provided clean, quality water. Multiple disinfectants can be utilized to optimize a good water quality program. The goal of these water disinfectants is to greatly reduce or eliminate the presence of all bacteria. In recent years, the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) meter has been a tool utilized by the poultry industry to monitor chlorine efficacy in drinking water. An ORP reading of 650 - 750 millivolts (mV) has become the industry standard for assuring an acceptable sanitizing residual of free chlorine is present for controlling microbial contamination regardless of the actual amount of total or free chlorine or the water pH. A recent bench top evaluation of a new chlorine product revealed microbial contamination even when the oxidation-reduction potential read 650 mV. Given these results, it is beneficial for the poultry industry to re-evaluate the relationship between total chlorine residual, <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual,</b> ORP value, and microbial levels. Additionally, the study determined if a new ORP standard should be the target and if this standard consistently correlates to <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> (ppm) even under scenarios of different water quality parameters. This study evaluated the efficacy of two different forms of chlorine, a liquid product (sodium hypochlorite) and a crystalline dry product (sodium dichloro-S-triazinetrione) at three concentrations (2, 4, and 8 oz/gal) commonly used for drinking water sanitation in the poultry industry. The objective {{was to determine the}} relationship between total and <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual,</b> ORP, pH, and microbial content of the water when the chlorine products are utilized in water with a high microbial level typically found in unclean poultry drinking water lines. Results indicated both forms of chlorine were effective disinfectants for reducing aerobic bacteria present in the water. Additionally, the results of this experiment showed under field conditions where microbiologically challenged water is present, an ORP reading of 700 mV is required to achieve an efficient microbial reduction/elimination and this is supported by at least 3 ppm of free chlorine...|$|E

The suspension was layered onto 5 to 30 % linear sucrose gradients and centrifuged; the fractions containing HAV were dialyzed, and a 1 : 500, 000 dilution of this preparation induced hepatitis and seroconversion in 2 of 4 marmosets. A 1 : 50 dilution of this preparation served as inoculum. Untreated inoculum induced overt hepatitis and seroconversion in 100 % (5 of 5) of marmosets inoculated intramuscularly. Inoculum treated for various periods (15, 30, or 60 min) with 0. 5, 1. 0, or 1. 5 mg of <b>free</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> per liter induced hepatitis in 14 % (2 of 14), 8 % (1 of 12), and 10 % (1 of 10) of marmosets, respectively, and induced seroconversion in 29, 33, and 10 % of the animals.

40|$|Disinfection is an {{essential}} process {{in the treatment of}} municipal wastewater before the treated wastewater can be discharged to the environment. Hillsborough County 2 ̆ 7 s Northwest Regional Water Reclamation Facility (NWRWRF) in Tampa, Florida, currently uses ultraviolet (UV) light for disinfection. However, this method has proven expensive to implement and maintain, and may not be effective if the light transmission is poor. For these reasons, Hillsborough County is considering switching from UV light to sodium hypochlorite for disinfection. However, hypochlorite (chlorine) disinfection has disadvantages as well, such as the production of disinfection by-products (DBPs) such as trihalomethanes (THM) and haloacetic acids (HAAs), which may have adverse impacts on the quality of surface waters that receive the treated wastewater. Therefore, the objectives of this research are (1) to compare NWRWRF typical operating conditions and water quality to those of two nearby facilities (River Oaks and Dale Mabry Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plants) that currently employ chlorine disinfection, (2) to determine the chlorine demand of treated effluent from NWRWRF, (3) to quantify the DBP formation potential of treated effluent from NWRWRF, and (4) {{to determine the effects of}} temperature, reaction time, and chlorine dose on chlorine demand and THM formation. To inform laboratory experiments, the quality of final effluent was monitored at NWRWRF and at two nearby wastewater treatment plants that currently use hypochlorite for disinfection. At these two facilities, pH of 7. 0 - 8. 0, chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 12 - 26 mg/L, alkalinity of 200 - 250 mg/L as CaCO 3, chlorine residual of 1. 5 - 6. 0 mg/L, and total trihalomethanes of 100 - 190 ix μg/L (mostly chloroform) were observed. Conditions at NWRWRF were similar to those at Dale Mabry and River Oaks AWWTP, suggesting that chlorine demand and THM formation at NWRWRF would be similar to those at the two AWWTP, if chlorination is to be used. THM experimental results agreed with this suggestion. Chlorine dose and temperature effects on the <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> and THMs production in NWRWRF filtered wastewater effluent were determined. Filtered effluent was collected and transported to USF laboratory where it was tested for 3 different chlorine doses (6 mg/L, 9 mg/L and 12 mg/L as Cl 2) and 3 different temperatures (16 °C, 23 °C, and 30 °C) at 7 different contact times (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 120 min) in duplicate. The total number of batches prepared was: 3 different chlorine doses × 3 different temperatures × 7 different reaction times = 126 reactors. According to Florida Administrative code 62 - 600. 440, total chlorine residual should be at least 1 mg/L after a contact time of at least 15 min at peak hourly flow. Also, according to Florida Administrative code 62 - 600. 440, if effluent wastewater has a concentration of fecal coliforms greater than 10, 000 per 100 mL before disinfection, FDEP requires that the product of the chlorine concentration C (in mg/L as Cl 2) and the contact time t (in minutes) be at least 120. Results showed that <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> was always above 1 mg/L in 15 min contact time for all chlorine doses and temperatures tested in this thesis. However, to be conservative, thesis conclusions and recommendations were based on the more stringent regulation: C*t ≥ 120 mg. min/L, assuming that the number of fecal coliform in NWRWRF wastewater effluent exceeds 10, 000 per 100 mL prior to disinfection. The analysis showed that <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> for 6 mg/L was below the FDEP standard at all temperatures. At 16 °C and 23 °C, chlorine doses of 9 and 12 mg/L resulted in an appropriate <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> above the FDEP standard. However, a chlorine dose of 12 mg/L was resulting in high residual, which means high THM would be expected. Therefore, at 16 x and 23 °C, 9 mg/L would be preferable. At 30 °C, only the chlorine dose of 12 mg/L met the standard at all contact times. As expected, <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> decreased with an increase in temperature from 23 °C to 30 °C. Surprisingly, the residual at 16 °C was lower than residual at 23 °C. The production of THMs increased with higher contact time in all the experiments completed. Chlorine dose didn 2 ̆ 7 t have an effect on THM formation at 23 °C, but it did at 30 °C and 16 °C, where THM concentrations were generally higher with the increase of chlorine dose. Temperature effect was noticed in most of the experiments, where THM production was usually higher at higher temperatures, except some cases where formation was similar for different temperatures. Chloroform, dichlorobromomethane, dibromochloromethane production ranges were respectively: 20 - 127 μg/L, 18 - 59 μg/L, and 3 - 7 μg/L. Bromoform concentrations were not observed in this experiment at any temperature or chlorine dose. According to Florida Administrative code 62 - 302. 530, Criteria for Surface Water Quality Classifications, the Florida Department for Environmental Protection (FDEP) set the following limits for THM concentrations in wastewater effluent to be as the following; 470 μg/L for chloroform, 22 μg/L for dichlorobromomethane, 34 μg/L for dibromochloromethane, and 360 μg/L for bromoform. Experimental results on NWRWRF filtered effluent showed that only dichlorobromomethane exceeded the limits set by FDEP at about 30 min contact time for all temperatures and chlorine doses tested. However, according to Florida Administrative code 62 - 302 - 400, proposed changes to the code have set higher DCBM limit of 57 μg/L. Chlorination would be recommended at NWRWRF if the DCBM regulated limit increases to 57 μg/L.

The effects of various chlorine concentrations, temperatures, and pH levels were considered. A number of different Legionella strains, both environmental and clinical, were tested. The results indicate that legionellae are much more resistant to chlorine than are coliform bacteria. At 21 degrees C, pH 7. 6, and 0. 1 mg of <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> per liter, a 99 % kill of L. pneumophila was achieved within 40 min, compared with less than 1 min for Escherichia coli. The observed resistance is enhanced as conditions for disinfection become less optimal. The required contact time for the removal of L. pneumophilia was twice as long at 4 degrees C than it was at 21 degrees C. These data suggest that legionellae can survive low levels of chlorine for relatively long periods of time...|$|E

40|$|Microbiological and {{chemical}} quality {{of drinking water}} primarily results from water origin and type of applied water treatment. Since the drinking water {{is one of the}} mean way through which many infectious agents can be transmitted to humans causing waterborne diseases, constant monitoring of drinking water quality in water supply systems is needed. This study investigates the microbiological quality of drinking water in twenty five public and municipal water supply systems in the area of Osijek-Baranja County in eastern Croatia. The microbiological analyses were conducted for following parameters: total coliforms, Escherichia coli, colony count at 22 °C and 37 °C, enterococci and Clostridium perfringens. In most of investigated water supply systems processed groundwater are used, and since increased concentrations of some chemical compounds in water can influence on appearance and growth of microbiological populations, in this study relevant physicochemical parameters were also measured and correlated with obtained values of analyzed microbiological parameters. Five physicochemical indicators were determined: temperature, turbidity, pH value, <b>free</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> and ammonium concentration. Results indicated that 149 of 1503 analyzed drinking water samples were non-compliance with microbiological criteria set by Croatian regulations (88. 7 % and 89. 2 % of 149 had values of colony count at 22 °C and 37 °C higher than the required). Total coliforms, enterococci and Escherichia coli were founded in 3. 9 %, 1. 1 % and 1 % of non-compliance drinking water samples, respectively. Clostridium perfringens was not detected in any of the drinking water samples. Calculating Pearson’s coefficients of correlation among analyzed microbiological and physicochemical indicators, very weak correlations were obtained. The highest but negative correlation was observed between appearance of microbiological population and concentrations of <b>free</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> (lower <b>free</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> – higher appearance of microbiological population) and positive correlation between turbidity and appearance of microbiological population (higher turbidity – higher appearance of microbiological population) ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Bacteria of {{the genus}} Klebsiella {{have been found to}} be {{associated}} with redwood water storage reservoirs, redwood chips, and liquid expressed from within living redwood. A 1, 000 gallon experimental redwood reservoir was employed to determine how to control the presence of Klebsiella and Enterobacter in drinking water stored in these tanks. Over a twenty month period of operation, these coliforms were not detected in tank water. Control of Klebsiella and Enterobacter was dependent on three factors: maintenance of a <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> of 0. 2 - 0. 4 ppm in the tank water, maximum retention times of four to seven days, and the use of a separate overhead inlet water pipe. Klebsiella multiplied to 10 ⁶ per ml in dechlorinated water samples from the experimental tank, utilizing nutrients leached from the redwood. The predominant metabolizable carbon sources in aqueous extracts of redwood are cyclitol compounds, of which myo-inositol is the parent compound. Pinitol and sequoyitol, two other cyclitols, are also encountered in redwood. 100...|$|E
40|$|The {{specified}} range of <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> (between minimum and maximum) in water distribution systems {{needs to be}} maintained to avoid deterioration of the microbial quality of water, control taste and/or odor problems, and hinder formation of carcino-genic disinfection by-products. Multiple water quality sources for providing chlorine input are needed to maintain the chlorine residuals within a {{specified range}} throughout the distribution system. The determination of source dosage (i. e., chlorine concentrations/chlorine mass rates) at water quality sources to satisfy the above objective under dynamic conditions is a complex process. A nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to determine the chlorine dosage at the water quality sources subjected to minimum and maximum constraints on chlorine concentrations at all monitoring nodes. A genetic algorithm (GA) approach in which decision variables (chlorine dosage) are coded as binary strings is used to solve this highly nonlinear optimization problem, with nonlinearities arising due to set-point sources and non-first-order reactions. Application of the model is illustrated using three sample water distribution systems, and it indicates that the GA,is {{a useful tool for}} evaluating optimal water quality source chlorine schedules...|$|E
40|$|The most {{commonly}} applied active disinfectant {{in drinking water}} distribution system (DWDS) is <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> (FCR) {{in the form of}} hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ion. The concentration of FCR decreases along the transport pipeline. Controlled replenishment of chlorine at various sites in DWDS is critical to maintain the FCR in the safe range of 0. 2 - 0. 6 ppm. This study proposed a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model (developed in Simulink of Matlab 7. 0. 1) that simultaneously takes into account chlorine dosing and decay process with the considerations of process disturbances. The model is further implemented into a centralised model predictive control (CMPC) system. The advantages of our CMPC system in controlling multiple outputs are its robustness and short settling time, compared to the conventional process-data-based proportional integral (PI) control strategies. Moreover, the simplicity of this reactive-transport-model-based MIMO control system and the use of Matlab promise an easy adaptation to field test and plant implementation. It addresses an important need in water quality management, particularly for developing countries. No Full Tex...|$|E

Turbidity, fecal coliform, Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) and <b>free</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> were analyzed. The measured turbidity and <b>free</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> in many of the villages were less than drinking water guidelines. Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) and fecal coliforms tests in drinking water samples were positive. According to the results, it is found out that the water source used for drinking consumption must be fully treated properly and finally be chlorinated Water and Wastewater Company should have a proper consideration on safe drinking water supply.

40|$|Introduction: Legionella {{bacteria}} are ubiquitous microorganisms mostly found in artificial water environments, especially those which produce aerosol, such as swimming pools, saunas, and spas. Development of Legionella depends on several factors, including water temperature and chlorine. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the occurrence of Legionella spp. to the temperature and <b>free</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> in tap water, water from fountains, swimming pools, cooling and heating systems. Methods: We collected 238 samples of water taken from different places and analyzed the presence of Legionella spp. by BAS EN ISO 11731 - 2 : 2009 - Water quality – Detection and enumeration of Legionella - Part 2 : A direct membrane filtration method for waters with low bacterial counts, as samples were the waters with low expectancy of bacterial contamination compared to the temperature and <b>free</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine.</b> The X 2 test was used to show statistical significance. Results: Legionella spp. was detected in 18. 62 % of tap water and in 8. 82 % samples of water taken from fountains, swimming pools, and cooling and heating systems. The highest number of positive samples were detected in waters with the temperature higher than 20 °C and lower than 50 °C. The highest number of positive samples were reported by the concentration of <b>free</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> lower than 0. 2 mg/l. The X 2 test showed a statistically significant difference between positive and negative results for the presence of Legionella spp. among three groups of water samples. Conclusion: The research has shown a connection between environmental factors and the presence of Legionella spp. in the water systems of public and tourist facilities...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the usefulness of ribotyping for the differentiation of aeromonads isolated from five patients with gastroenteritis and from the source water, treatment plant, and distribution system of a small public water supply. Aeromonas hydrophila and Aeromonas caviae were isolated from fecal specimens preserved in Cary-Blair transport medium by using blood ampicillin agar or alkaline peptone water (pH 8. 4) subcultured to blood ampicillin agar plates. A. hydrophila, Aeromonas sobria, and A. caviae were isolated from duplicate 100 -ml water samples by the membrane filter technique by using ampicillin dextrin agar for quantitative determination of growth and alkaline peptone water enrichment for detection of {{the presence or absence}} of aeromonads below the detection limit of the membrane filter method. In addition, <b>free</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residuals</b> and pH values were determined for all water samples and heterotrophic plate counts and total and fecal coliform analyses were performed on them. Ribotyping patterns of aeromonads recovered from well 1, detention basin, sand filter, softener, and distribution samples were compared with those of the five clinical isolates. All patient strains were unique; however, identical ribotypes of A. hydrophila and A. sobria isolated from multiple sites in the water system indicated colonization of a well, sand filters, and the softener, with the potential for sporadic contamination of distribution water. Plant operational deficiencies were noted and corrected. Ribotyping can effectively differentiate otherwise indistinguishable strains of bacteria, thus providing a powerful tool for investigation of waterborne diseases and bacteriological problems within water treatment plants and distribution systems...|$|R
