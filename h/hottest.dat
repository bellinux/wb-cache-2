30|$|<b>Hot</b> {{is rarely}} used dysphemistically. A <b>hot</b> {{property}} is one highly regarded and desirable and therefore valuable (whether {{or not this}} is real estate or used of a starlet) of which one might exclaim <b>Hot</b> dog! Most figurative uses of <b>hot</b> derive from its literal use as something which generates heat and/or retains applied heat, as in the implied reference to blacksmithing in strike while the iron is hot—because the <b>hot</b> metal is malleable; hence ‘act when conditions are right’. Vigorous activity generates heat, hence the orthophemistic <b>hot</b> rod and <b>hot</b> licks in <b>hot</b> jazz and the euphemisms for sexual passion aroused in have the <b>hots</b> for that girl, she’s <b>hot</b> stuff. Most likely dysphemistic is I have a <b>hot</b> cock for her <b>hot</b> pants. It is possible that the rhyming Australian idiom <b>hot</b> to trot “ready and eager to get underway” is associated with sexual preparedness or more mundanely with the heat of a revved engine. It is usually at least mildly dysphemistic to describe someone as <b>hot</b> blooded “easily angered”, <b>hot</b> under the collar, or just plain <b>hot</b> “angry”. Because <b>hot</b> things burn, the <b>hot</b> seat was slang for the electric chair; however, the hyperbole to be in the <b>hot</b> seat often has much less fatal consequences in everyday use. To refer to stolen property as <b>hot</b> presumably derives from the risk of being figuratively burned if one is caught with it and prosecuted.|$|R

5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Death Valley Pupfish swam to the area from the Colorado River via a long-since dried-up system of rivers and lakes (see Lake Manly).

5|$|The corona is {{the next}} layer of the Sun. The low corona, near {{the surface of the}} Sun, has a {{particle}} density around 1015m−3 to 1016m−3.

5|$|At a {{barometric}} pressure of 218 atmospheres, the critical point {{of water is}} 375°C. At a depth of 3,000meters, the {{barometric pressure}} of sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the <b>hottest</b> parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E
