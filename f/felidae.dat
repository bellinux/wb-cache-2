5|$|The {{jungle cat}} {{is a member}} of the genus Felis, which {{consists}} of small cats, within the family <b>Felidae.</b>|$|E
5|$|All {{the cats}} in this genus {{share a common}} {{ancestor}} that {{is believed to have}} lived around 6–7million years ago in the Near East (the Middle East). The exact relationships within the <b>Felidae</b> are close but still uncertain, e.g. the Chinese mountain cat is sometimes classified (under the name Felis silvestris bieti) as a subspecies of the wildcat, like the North African variety F. s. lybica.|$|E
5|$|The cheetah is {{the only}} extant species of the genus Acinonyx. It belongs to Felinae, the {{subfamily}} of <b>Felidae</b> that also includes lynxes, wildcats, and the puma. The species was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in his 1775 publication Die Säugethiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur mit Beschreibungen.|$|E

5000|$|Over {{a number}} of years Azam studied <b>Félida's</b> {{psychological}} profile and from his research published three reports. He described <b>Félida</b> as a hysterical patient who had a serious and sad (normal) state, along with a merry and generous state. He analyzed these two states as two distinct, separate personalities that seemed to be unaware of the other.|$|R
5000|$|According to the United States Census Bureau, the <b>Felida</b> CDP has a {{total area}} of , of which [...] is land and , or 4.74%, is water.|$|R
5|$|The cheetah's closest {{relatives}} are the cougar (Puma concolor) and the jaguarundi (P.yagouaroundi). These three species together form the Puma lineage, {{one of the}} eight lineages of <b>Felidae.</b> The sister group of the Puma lineage is a clade of smaller Old World cats that includes the genera Felis, Otocolobus and Prionailurus.|$|E
5|$|The fossa was {{formally}} described by Edward Turner Bennett {{on the basis}} of a specimen from Madagascar sent by Charles Telfair in 1833. The common name is the same as the generic name of the Malagasy civet (Fossa fossana), but they are different species. Because of shared physical traits with civets, mongooses, and cats (<b>Felidae),</b> its classification has been controversial. Bennett originally placed the fossa as a type of civet in the family Viverridae, a classification that long remained popular among taxonomists. Its compact braincase, large eye sockets, retractable claws, and specialized carnivorous dentition have also led some taxonomists to associate it with the felids. In 1939, William King Gregory and Milo Hellman placed the fossa in its own subfamily within <b>Felidae,</b> the Cryptoproctinae. George Gaylord Simpson placed it back in Viverridae in 1945, still within its own subfamily, yet conceded it had many cat-like characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, the caracal was {{classified}} under the genera Felis or Lynx. However, a 2006 phylogenetic {{study showed that}} the caracal evolved nearly a million years before the lynx appeared. The caracal is most {{closely related to the}} African golden cat (Profelis aurata, often considered a species of Caracal). These two species, together with the serval (Leptailurus serval), form one of the eight lineages of <b>Felidae.</b> The Caracal lineage came into existence 8.5 mya, and the ancestor of this lineage arrived in Africa 8.5–5.6 mya.|$|E
50|$|<b>Felida</b> is a census-designated place (CDP) in Clark County, Washington, United States. The {{population}} was 7,385 at the 2010 census, up from 5,683 at the 2000 census.|$|R
50|$|Curtis Lake is a lake in Clark County in the U.S. {{state of}} Washington. The lake, near the {{confluence}} of Salmon Creek and Lake River, is northwest {{of the community of}} <b>Felida.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Felida</b> {{is located}} in southwestern Clark County at [...] (45.709848, -122.705373). It is 7 mi north of {{downtown}} Vancouver and is bordered by the communities of Salmon Creek (to the east) and Lake Shore (to the south).|$|R
5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} of the serval {{have remained in}} dispute; in 1997, palaeontologists M.C. McKenna and S.K. Bell classified Leptailurus as a subgenus of Felis, while others like O.R.P. Bininda-Edmonds (of the Technical University of Munich) have grouped it with Felis, Lynx and Caracal. Studies in the 2000s and the 2010s show that the serval, along with the caracal and the African golden cat, forms {{one of the eight}} lineages of <b>Felidae.</b> According to a 2006 genetic study, the Caracal lineage came into existence 8.5mya, and the ancestor of this lineage arrived in Africa 8.5–5.6mya.|$|E
5|$|The lion (Panthera leo) {{is one of}} the big cats in the <b>Felidae</b> {{family and}} a member of genus Panthera. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996, as populations in African range {{countries}} declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. The West African lion population is listed as Critically Endangered since 2016. The only lion population in Asia survives in and around India's Gir Forest National Park and is listed as Endangered since 1986.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Géraldine Veron and François Catzeflis {{published}} a DNA hybridization study {{suggesting that the}} fossa was {{more closely related to}} mongooses (family Herpestidae) than to cats or civets. However, in 1995, Veron's morphological study once again grouped it with <b>Felidae.</b> In 2003, molecular phylogenetic studies using nuclear and mitochondrial genes by Anne Yoder and colleagues showed that all native Malagasy carnivorans share a common ancestry that excludes other carnivores (meaning they form a clade, making them monophyletic) and are most closely related to Asian and African Herpestidae. To reflect these relationships, all Malagasy carnivorans are now placed in a single family, Eupleridae. Within Eupleridae, the fossa is placed in the subfamily Euplerinae along with the falanouc (Eupleres goudoti) and Malagasy civet, but its exact relationships are poorly resolved.|$|E

25|$|Canine {{distemper}} (sometimes termed hardpad disease) is a {{viral disease}} that affects {{a wide variety}} of animal families, including domestic and wild species of dogs, coyotes, foxes, pandas, wolves, ferrets, skunks, raccoons, and large cats, as well as pinnipeds, some primates, {{and a variety of other}} species. It was long believed that animals in the family <b>Felidae,</b> including many species of large cat as well as domestic cats, were resistant to canine distemper, until some researchers reported the prevalence of CDV infection in large felids. It is now known that both large <b>Felidae</b> and domestic cats can be infected, usually through close housing with dogs or possibly blood transfusion from infected cats, but such infections appear to be self-limiting and largely without symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The {{snow leopard}} {{is part of}} the Panthera lineage, one of the eight {{lineages}} of <b>Felidae.</b> This lineage comprises the species of Panthera and Neofelis. The Neofelis lineage diverged first remainder of the Felinae (see figure). Subsequent branching between the snow leopard and clouded leopard began two to three million years ago, but the details of this are disputed.|$|E
25|$|In Paleolithic times, the {{representation}} of humans in cave paintings was rare. Mostly, animals were painted, not only animals that were used as food but also animals that represented strength like the rhinoceros or large <b>Felidae,</b> as in the Chauvet Cave. Signs like dots were sometimes drawn. Rare human representations include handprints and stencils, and figures depicting human / animal hybrids. The Chauvet Cave in the Ardèche Departments of France contains the most important preserved cave paintings of the Paleolithic era, painted around 31,000 BC. The Altamira cave paintings in Spain were done 14,000 to 12,000 BC and show, among others, bisons. The hall of bulls in Lascaux, Dordogne, France, {{is one of the}} best known cave paintings and dates to about 15,000 to 10,000 BC.|$|E
50|$|The {{remnants}} of Typhoon Ginger brought strong winds and heavy rain to the Western United States. Winds along the Oregon coastline gusted up to 69 mph. The highest rainfall total {{was recorded in}} <b>Felida,</b> Washington at 1.3 in. Power was also briefly cut to 450 people by the high winds.|$|R

It is bordered to the {{northeast}} by Mount Vista, to the east by Barberton, to the southeast by Walnut Grove, to the south by Hazel Dell, to the southwest by Lake Shore, and to the west by <b>Felida.</b> Downtown Vancouver is 6 mi to the south.|$|R
500|$|Overall, the fossa has {{features}} {{in common with}} three different carnivoran families, leading researchers to place it {{and other members of}} Eupleridae alternatively in Herpestidae, Viverridae, and <b>Felidae.</b> Felid features are primarily those associated with eating and digestion, including tooth shape and facial portions of the skull, the tongue, and the digestive tract, typical of its exclusively carnivorous diet. The remainder of the skull most closely resembles skulls of genus Viverra, while the general body structure is most similar to that of various members of Herpestidae. The permanent dentition is [...] (three incisors, one canine, three or four premolars, and one molar on each side of both the upper and lower jaws), with the deciduous formula being similar but lacking the fourth premolar and the molar. The fossa has a large, prominent rhinarium similar to that of viverrids, but has comparatively larger, round ears, almost as large as those of a similarly sized felid. Its facial vibrissae (whiskers) are long, with the longest being longer than its head. Like some mongoose genera, particularly Galidia (which is now in the fossa's own family, Eupleridae) and Herpestes (of Herpestidae), it has carpal vibrissae as well. Its claws are retractile, but unlike those of <b>Felidae</b> species, they are not hidden in skin sheaths. It has three pairs of nipples (one inguinal, one ventral, and one pectoral).|$|E
500|$|The caracal {{is placed}} in the family <b>Felidae</b> and {{subfamily}} Felinae. The species was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber as Felis caracal in the journal Die Säugetiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur mit Beschreibungen in 1776. In 1843, British zoologist John Edward Gray placed the animal in the genus Caracal. The name [...] "caracal" [...] is composed of two Turkish words: kara, meaning black, and kulak, meaning ear. The first recorded use of this name dates back to 1760. Alternative names for the caracal include , , , and red or [...] The [...] "lynx" [...] of the Greeks and Romans was most probably the caracal and the name [...] "lynx" [...] is sometimes still applied to it, but the present-day lynx proper is a separate species.|$|E
500|$|Long {{the most}} {{completely}} known saber-toothed cat, Smilodon {{is still one}} of the best-known members of the group, to the point where the two concepts have been confused. The term [...] "saber-tooth" [...] refers to an ecomorph consisting of various groups of extinct predatory synapsids (mammals and close relatives), which convergently evolved extremely long maxillary canines, as well as adaptations to the skull and skeleton related to their use. This includes members of Gorgonopsia, Thylacosmilidae, Machaeroidinae, Nimravidae, Barbourofelidae, and Machairodontinae. Within the family <b>Felidae</b> (true cats), members of the subfamily Machairodontinae are referred to as saber-toothed cats, and this group is itself divided into three tribes: Metailurini (false saber-tooths); Homotherini (scimitar-toothed cats); and Smilodontini (dirk-toothed cats), to which Smilodon belongs. Members of Smilodontini are defined by their long slender canines with fine to no serrations, whereas Homotherini are typified by shorter, broad, and more flattened canines, with coarser serrations. Members of Metailurini were less specialized and had shorter, less flattened canines, and are not recognized as members of Machairodontinae by some researchers.|$|E
50|$|Hazel Dell and Minnehaha {{were two}} of the first {{suburban}} areas to be developed after World War II and were followed by Lake Shore, <b>Felida,</b> and Salmon Creek. Much of the housing boom in this area has subsided due to the increase of homes being built to the east of Vancouver, between Interstate 205 and Camas and Washington State Route 500/Fourth Plain Boulevard and the Columbia River.|$|R
50|$|Klineline Pond and Battle Ground Lake are {{the only}} two lakes in the {{watershed}} that are larger than 5 acre. Salmon Creek Park at the pond offers picnicking, fishing, swimming, and hiking opportunities. The Salmon Creek Greenway Trail follows the creek for about 3 mi between the pond and <b>Felida</b> Bridge. Connecting trails include Cougar Creek Trail and a trail between Klineline Pond and East Lake, east of Interstate 5.|$|R
50|$|The case of <b>Félida</b> X {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} documented descriptions of what would later be called a multiple personality disorder. At the time, this situation garnered interest in the medical community, and created several puzzling questions in regards to the concept of Self, {{as well as to the}} definition of personal ego. Additionally from a quasi-religious context, the concept of multiple personalities was contrary to the paranormal belief system of Spiritualism (religious movement), which had a large following in the 19th century.|$|R
500|$|Like {{almost all}} members of the <b>Felidae,</b> cats have protractable and {{retractable}} claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. The fifth front claw (the dewclaw) is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth [...] "finger". This special feature of the front paws, {{on the inside of the}} wrists, is the carpal pad, also found on the paws of big cats and dogs. It has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some breeds of cats are prone to polydactyly (extra toes and claws). These are particularly common along the northeast coast of North America.|$|E

60|$|The {{domestic}} cats, as they invariably do in such plentiful seasons, absented {{themselves from}} the house, assuming all the habits of their wild congeners, and slinking from the sight of man--even of a former fireside companion--with a shy secrecy in their motions, an apparent affectation of fear, almost ludicrous to see. Foxes, weasels, and opossums fared sumptuously. Even for the common armadillo (Dasypus villosus) it was a season of affluence, for this creature is very adroit in capturing mice. This fact might seem surprising to anyone who marks the uncouth figure, toothless gums, and the motions--anything but light and graceful--of the armadillo and perhaps fancying that, to be a dexterous mouser, an animal should bear some resemblance in habits and structure to the <b>felidas.</b> But animals, like men, are compelled to adapt themselves to their surroundings; new habits are acquired, and the exact co-relation between habit and structure is seldom maintained.|$|R
