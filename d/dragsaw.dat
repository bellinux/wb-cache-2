50|$|According to one hypothesis, {{evidence}} {{for the use of}} stone-cutting <b>dragsaws</b> may date from the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt, about 4,500 years before its commonly accepted date of invention.Dragsaws were the grandfather of our well known chain and reciprocated saw and are known as the first mechanical saws used in the timber industry operation. Powered by a steam-powered winch, they supposed to be portable, but in reality many of them weighed nearly 400 pounds, making its mobility very difficult. These huge tools were a great help for the log business, because they were efficient and very resilient. Early <b>dragsaws</b> of the modern era were steam powered and later gasoline powered. Some manufacturers included Multnomah, Vaughn and Wee McGregor.|$|R

Often chainsaws were so heavy {{that they had}} wheels like <b>dragsaws.</b> Other outfits used driven lines from a wheeled power unit to drive the cutting bar.|$|R
