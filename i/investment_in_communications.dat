40|$|This article {{examines}} the dualistic nature of communications in China. It identifies three levels of communication dualism: rural-urban, core-peripheral and advanced-rudimentary. The first concerns socioeconomic disparity, the second arises from locational imbalance {{and the third is}} a technological gap. The study shows that the first two kinds of disparities exhibit a conflictual relationship in which the traditional and modern sectors disrupt each other, but the technological disparity is of a complementary nature since the two sectors coexist peacefully without draining each other's resources. Complementary dualism can be helpful to development, but the Chinese government seems to be less active in narrowing down the rural-urban and core-peripheral disparities than in trying to close the technological gap. The socioeconomic and geographical gaps will obstruct the flow of information, forming a serious barrier to the transformation of China into an information society. More conscious effort to substantially increase <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>communications</b> is needed to ameliorate the rural-urban and core-peripheral gaps. ...|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} the Indonesian Family Life Surveys, this paper studies the impact of fiscal {{decentralisation}} in Indonesia on local public spending across communities with different types of local institutions. Our results provide evidence of heterogeneity in access to public goods across communities in the period prior to fiscal decentralisation; with significantly greater spending on schools and health centres in communities which observe traditional adat laws (which promote an ethic of mutual cooperation), and less spending on roads, public transport, communications etc. in communities which have a democratic electoral system. Fiscal decentralisation led {{to an increase in}} the share of spending on physical infrastructure, as well as a convergence in spending across communities with different types of local institutions. We develop a theoretical model to argue that communities which enjoy a higher level of mutual cooperation would benefit less from investment in public goods which facilitate communication and exchange with outsiders - as these improve the outside options of community members and therefore makes it more difficult to sustain intra-community cooperation. Surprisingly, <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>communications</b> and transport infrastructure in these communities were more restrained during the period of centralised fiscal control...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{historical}} {{transformation of the}} European regulatory framework for electronic communications from the era dominated by state-owned enterprises {{to the presence of}} regulated competition. In the course of these developments, the vision of the roles of {{the public and private sectors}} in electronic communications changed in expected and unexpected ways. While the period is characterized by a shift toward less direct state intervention, the intensity of regulation has increased in many areas. Most recently, in the wake of the financial crisis, new forms of state intervention can be observed, including public <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>communications</b> infrastructure and public-private partnerships. As a result of the reforms, Europe has been able to achieve major successes but it also suffered unanticipated setbacks compared to other regions. The European Union emerged as the global leader in mobile communications during the 1990 s and was able to roll-out first-generation broadband access networks more rapidly than many of its peers. Recently, however, Europe as a whole has not performed as well in deploying next-generation networks and advanced mobile communications services. The paper offers a political-economic explanation for these developments and assesses their effects on the performance of the European electronic communications sector and the economy. From this analysis, the European model emerges as a unique institutional arrangement with peculiar advantages and disadvantages. Once these are recognized, sensible next steps to build the strengths while avoiding the weaknesses of the model can be seen more clearly...|$|E
40|$|This {{chapter on}} {{urbanization}} and growth focuses on modeling and empirical evidence that pertain {{to a number}} of inter-related questions. Why do cities form in an economy, with so much of economic activity in countries geographically concentrated in cities? Second, how do different types of cities interact with each other in terms of trade and migration? Given {{the answers to these questions}} the chapter turns to growth issues. How does a system of cities evolve under economic and population growth; and how does urban growth intersect with, or even define national economic growth? In growth theory, endogenous growth is based on knowledge spillovers and sharing, and evidence suggests that much of that interaction must occur at the level of individual cities. In the early stages of growth, economic development is characterized by urbanization - a spatial transformation of the economy, where the population moves through migration from an agricultural, rural based existence to one where production occurs in cities of endogenous numbers and size. How do we model that transformation process and what are the key aspects of the transformation? In any static, growth, or development-urbanization context, how do governance, institutions, and public policy affect city formation and sizes, which then in turn affect economic efficiency. Cities require enormous public infrastructure investments which affect urban quality of life, in particular health and safety and commuting and congestion costs. Institutions governing land markets, property rights, local government autonomy, and local financing affect the city formation process and city sizes. And national government policies concerning trade, labor policies and national <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>communications</b> and transport infrastructure affect the shape of the urban system. A final set of questions has to do with where cities locate. What is the effect of history, of climate and of natural resource locations, including rivers and natural harbors, on the location of current urban agglomerations?...|$|E

40|$|Based on my {{forecasting}} model, NCR Corporation 2 ̆ 7 s domestic Personal Computer (PC) quarterly revenue can {{be expected}} to increase to between fifty-eight million dollars and seventy- three million. These quarterly forecasts may overestimate revenue during the expected coming recession since data was not available during such a similar time period in the past. All of the data is from 1984 to the present - a time in which the U. S. economy enjoyed continued slow growth. Although the quarterly forecasts are derived from a reliable econometric model, the uncertainty of the Gulf Crisis and coming recession are not represented in these statistical forecasts, thus management would be advised {{to take into account the}} more moderate forecasts from the monthly model as well. I found NCR 2 ̆ 7 s monthly domestic PC revenue to be a statistical function of U. S. Factory Capacitor Sales, Consumer Durables Production, Memory Circuits Leadtimes, and Communications Equipment Employment. NCR 2 ̆ 7 s quarterly domestic PC revenue was found to be a function of U.

As you can see, there is a lack of internal data in both these models. I found it very difficult to secure consistent, reliable figures on such variables as advertising expenditures and the number of sales people. These and possibly other internal variables could be very important and should be included in future updates of these models. A suggestion that would allow the addition of these variables, would be to set up an internal reporting system of revenue, advertising expenditures, number of sales people, and any other internal variables that might be of use. A consistent and reliable reporting system to the Market Research Department for use in the analysis and modification of these models could greatly increase the reliability of future forecasts...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we empirically {{estimate}} {{the contribution of}} the communications infrastructure to the growth of output and productivity at the dis-aggregate industry and at the aggregate economy levels. The estimated value of the marginal benefits or the shadow price of the communications infrastructure capital is positive in each of 34 industries representing the major industrial sectors of the U. S. economy. This effect captures network externality benefits and can be interpreted as a willingness to pay by each industry for communications infrastructure capital services over and above their direct payments for communications services. These results suggest that an increase <b>in</b> <b>communications</b> infrastructure capital services reduces cost in all the industries and as a consequence that of the entire economy.

40|$|Communication {{networks}} have witnessed significant {{growth in the}} last decade due to the dramatic growth in the use of Internet. The reliability and service quality requirements of modern data communication networks and the large <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>communications</b> infrastructure have made it critical to design optimized networks that meet the performance parameters. Digital Data Service (DDS) is a popular communication service that provides users with a digital connection. The design of a DDS network is a special case of the classic Steiner-tree problem of finding the minimum cost tree connecting a set of nodes, using Steiner nodes. Since it is a combinatorial optimization problem several heuristic algorithms have been developed including Tabu search, and branch and cut algorithm. In this paper, a new approach using genetic algorithms (GAs) is proposed to solve the problem. The results from GA are compared with the Tabu search method. The results indicate that GA performs as well as Tabu search in terms of solution quality but has lower computation time. However, reducing the number of iterations in Tabu search makes it faster than GA and comparable in solution quality with GA...|$|R
