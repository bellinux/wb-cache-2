It would mean such a serious loss to him in money and {{influence}} {{not to have the}} March article come out—Everyone would think he was beaten and scared out, for the articles are under such a glare of publicity and such a fire of criticism. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with the January article remember, my work begins to appear in February.

Richard Maibaum's original script from 1961 was used as the basis of the script, which he then re-drafted, with further revisions by John Hopkins. Principal filming began in Paris on 16 February 1965, and moved to Nassau on 22 March, before concluding at Pinewood Studios in May.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Kajol {{starred in}} two major {{commercial}} successes—Rakesh Roshan's Karan Arjun and Aditya Chopra's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge—both opposite Shah Rukh Khan. The former was a melodramatic thriller, {{based on the}} concept of reincarnation, in which she played Sonia Saxena, a supporting character who forms the love interest of Khan. The film eventually emerged as the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. She justified playing a minor role in the film by saying, [...] "I did Karan Arjun because I wanted to know how it feels to be an ornament. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to do in the film except look good". Kajol's next three releases that year—Taaqat, Hulchul and Gundaraj—failed to do well commercially; the latter two were her earliest collaborations with her future-husband, the actor Ajay Devgn.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{guitar and}} bass {{ensemble}} was primarily dictated by Frusciante, {{rather than a}} collaborative effort between him and bassist Flea. Therefore, the record took different direction than any previous Chili Peppers' album. Frusciante sought to create an emotional and poignant soundscape throughout the recording. Drawing influences from musicians such as Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column and John McGeoch, Frusciante made use of textured and multilayered guitar progressions on By the Way, using tools such as the mellotron and various effects pedals throughout. In 2006, while promoting the band's subsequent studio album, Stadium Arcadium, Flea reflected on the composition of By the Way, stating: [...] "John went to this whole level of artistry. But he {{made me feel like}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to offer, like I knew shit." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{premise of}} Community {{was based on}} Harmon's real-life experiences. In an attempt to save his {{relationship}} with his then-girlfriend, he once enrolled in Glendale Community College, north of Los Angeles, where they would take Spanish together. Harmon got involved in a study group and – somewhat against his own instincts – became closely connected to the group of people with whom he had very little in common. [...] "...I was in this group with these knuckleheads and I started really liking them," [...] he explained, [...] "even though they {{had nothing to do with}} the film industry and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to gain from them and nothing to offer them." [...] With this as the background, Harmon wrote the show with a main character largely based on himself. He had, like Jeff, been self-centered and independent to the extreme before he realised the value of connecting with other people.|$|E
500|$|English {{novelist and}} critic Stephanie Merritt wrote in The Observer that once Carl finds Dominic and Danny, the novel [...] "loses {{momentum}} and becomes more didactic", {{and that the}} [...] "sheer exuberance of detail ... at times threatens to overwhelm the story". But overall she {{was impressed with the}} book, saying that it is [...] "a big, old-fashioned novel in the best sense". Joanna Scott wrote in The New York Times that she liked the sensory sensations Irving evoked in the book, in particular those brought on by Dominic's cooking. She also found some of the book's comical scenes, including the naked female skydiver landing in a pigpen, [...] "among the most memorable that Irving has written". Writer and critic Alan Cheuse in The Dallas Morning News enjoyed the book. He found the flight of the father and son a [...] "brilliant plot device", and was fascinated by the details of the restaurant business and the process of writing novels. [...] "As a writer, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> but admiration for Irving's modern version of the old flight and revenge motif." ...|$|E

Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E
500|$|Crews began hanging {{the sign}} in May 2014. When Chicago Tribune {{architecture}} critic Kamin warned Trump that {{his review of}} the sign would be unfavorable, Trump responded [...] "As time passes, it'll be like the Hollywood Sign", but architect Smith distanced himself from the sign saying [...] "Just for the record, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to do with this}} sign!". The controversy surrounding the sign drew attention in the national press and international press as it neared completion and the Associated Press ran a story about Mayor Emanuel's disapproval in mid-June. According to the Mayor's spokeswoman Kelley Quinn, [...] "Mayor Emanuel believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred by an architecturally tasteless sign". Kamin has noted that {{part of the problem is}} the architectural traditions of the city: [...] "If this sign was in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, nobody would care—but it is in Chicago, and in a part of Chicago full of great buildings from the 1920s to the 1960s and onward". Trump and Reilly both pointed out how unbecoming the prior Chicago Sun-Times building signage was via Twitter. As a result of the fiasco, Emanuel initiated a study on how to alter the rules to avert similar signage controversies in the future.|$|E
500|$|During {{her teenage}} years, Sevigny became rebellious: [...] "I was very well-mannered, {{and my mother}} was very strict. But I did hang out at the Mobil station and smoke cigarettes." [...] Between her junior and senior year of high school, she shaved her head and sold her hair to a Broadway wigmaker. She openly {{admitted}} to using drugs as a teenager, especially hallucinogens. She has commented that her father was aware of her experimentation with hallucinogens and marijuana, and even told her that it was okay, but that she had [...] "to stop if she had bad trips". Despite her father's leniency, her mother later chose to send her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2007, she told The Times that [...] "I had a great family life [...] I would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. I think I was very bored, and I did just love taking hallucinogens... but I often feel it's because I experimented when I was younger that I have no interest as an adult. I know a lot of adults who didn't, and it's much more dangerous when you start experimenting with drugs as an adult." [...] She often described herself as a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "depressed teenager". Her only extracurricular activity was occasionally skateboarding with her older brother, and she spent most of her free time in her bedroom: [...] "Mostly I sewed. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> better to do, so I made my own clothes." ...|$|E
