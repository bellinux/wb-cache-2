40|$|Purpose: of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} the usability of burnishing-inducted surface enhancement method for improve the stress corrosion cracking resistance of duplex stainless steel. Design/methodology/approach: The surface layers upon round in cross section specimens were performed through burnishing treatment. Corrosion tests were performed with the use of Slow Strain Rate Test technique in inert (glycerin) and aggressive (boiling 35 % MgCl 2 solution) environments. Findings: It was shown that burnishing treatment <b>increases</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistance</b> of the steel. Stress corrosion cracking resistance depends on the magnitude of cold work at surface layers. High level of cold work decreases corrosion resistance. Research limitations/implications: This study does not indicate the optimum stress level and stress distribution in surface layers for the best corrosion resistance. It is necessary to continue the research to determine burnishing parameters for demanded properties of duplex steel surface layers. Practical implications: The burnishing treatment can significantly improve stress corrosion resistance of specified parts of chemical installations working in the contact with aggressive media. Such parts as valve parts or propeller shafts can be successfully protected against corrosion attack. Originality/value: Burnishing surface enhancement for constructional parts made of duplex stainless steels exposed to corrosive environments has not been reported in literature.

In such a situation quarry dust can be an economical alternative to the river sand. In this paper an experimental study has been done to investigate the use of quarry dust as fine aggregate in concrete. Corrosion of steel reinforcement {{is one of the main}} durability problem which the reinforced concrete structures face world wide. The objective of this work is to study the strength and corrosion resisting properties of concrete containing quarry dust as fine aggregate along with an organic inhibitor namely Triethylamine at the dosage of 1 %, 2 %, 3 % and 4 % by weight of cement. Strength tests, water absorption test and the durability tests were conducted and the results were compared with the natural sand concrete. The resistance to corrosion is evaluated based on the performance of the concrete for the penetration of chloride ions by means of impressed voltage method and weight loss measurement.

The polarization curves showed {{that the presence of}} 5 -IPBDT successfully reduced the corrosion of copper and this effect increased with increasing the applied concentration. EIS revealed that the presence of inhibitor remarkably increased the impedance of copper electrode over the whole studied frequency range. By obtaining the polarization resistance, the inhibition efficiency of 5 -IPBDT as high as 93 %, which is in a good agreement with the results obtained by the polarization curves (96 %). By using SECM, the formation of the inhibitive film was followed in time. At the open circuit potential, the surface changed gradually from a conductive to an insulating surface in the presence of 5 -IPBDT. EQCM studies revealed that the inhibitor shifted the breakdown potential (Eb) of copper electrode to more anodic value, reduced the corrosion current density and hindered the electrode mass loss.

Cu was added to A 1 -Si in order to deposit Ni-Cu(P) on A 1 -Si-Cu lines without any activation step and obtain a good selectivity. It was observed that a 0. 2 ~m Ni-Cu(P) overcoat on a 0. 5 ~tm A 1 -Si-Cu line <b>increases</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistance,</b> suppresses hillock formation, and decreases the resistance of intercon-nection. The Ni-Cu(P) was deposited into via holes on Ni-Cu(P) overcoats of A 1 -Si-Cu lines without any activation. Via holes in a 1. 5 ~m polyimide layer were filled by Ni-Cu(P) to the top surface to give completely planarization of intercon-nections. Good contact resistance has also been obtained without any nealing by measuring the via chain resistance. For comparison, selective lectroless Ni(P) deposition on A 1 -Si with Pd activation was also investigated.

In fact {{the possibility of}} coating the structural carbon steal with austenitic stainless steel <b>increases</b> <b>corrosion</b> <b>resistance</b> and hydrogen attack resistance of structures, {{even if it does}} not resolve the whole problem. In this work welding overlay technology has been studied. Furthermore the welding overlay is fundamental in explosion cladding technology for the weld overlay restoring of joining areas uncovered during the welding process of the structural materials. Today this solution is largely used to build vessels, reactors, pipes, boiler tubes and heat exchangers. Cladding with austenitic stainless steel for corrosion resistance is used extensively in hydro-desulphurization reactors and other pressure vessels. For these particular applications, austenitic stainless steels or nickel-based alloys are clad onto a carbon or Cr-Mo steel substrate to inhibit corrosion and high-temperature oxidation, save material costs and prolong the life of the component. However, in some instances, these weld claddings have failed catastrophically near the weld fusion boundary. These failures cost the industry millions of dollars each year in repair or replacement. These failures, named “disbonding damage”, have produced cracking that has been observed in several locations near the fusion boundary region. This phenomenon is usually investigated by ultrasonic testing and metallurgical analysis. In order to study this phenomenon, the authors have utilized premature fracture methodology to correlate the damage caused by hydrogen with the charge rate and the partial pressure of the hydrogen inside. In particular it is possible to give an anticipatory analysis of hydrogen damage progress...|$|E
