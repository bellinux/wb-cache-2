5|$|Several {{experimental}} and clinical {{studies have indicated}} that aberrations and deregulations of the UPS contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative and myodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Pick's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and motor neuron diseases, polyglutamine (PolyQ) diseases, Muscular dystrophies and several rare forms of neurodegenerative diseases associated with dementia. As part of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS), the proteasome maintains cardiac protein homeostasis and thus plays a significant role in cardiac <b>Ischemic</b> <b>injury,</b> ventricular hypertrophy and Heart failure. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that the UPS plays an essential role in malignant transformation. UPS proteolysis {{plays a major role in}} responses of cancer cells to stimulatory signals that are critical for the development of cancer. Accordingly, gene expression by degradation of transcription factors, such as p53, c-Jun, c-Fos, NF-κB, c-Myc, HIF-1α, MATα2, STAT3, sterol-regulated element-binding proteins and androgen receptors are all controlled by the UPS and thus involved in the development of various malignancies. Moreover, the UPS regulates the degradation of tumor suppressor gene products such as adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) in colorectal cancer, retinoblastoma (Rb). and von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL), as well as a number of proto-oncogenes (Raf, Myc, Myb, Rel, Src, Mos, Abl). The UPS is also involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This activity is usually attributed to the role of proteasomes in the activation of NF-κB which further regulates the expression of pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β, IL-8, adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P selectine) and prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO). Additionally, the UPS also plays a role in inflammatory responses as regulators of leukocyte proliferation, mainly through proteolysis of cyclines and the degradation of CDK inhibitors. Lastly, autoimmune disease patients with SLE, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) predominantly exhibit circulating proteasomes which can be applied as clinical biomarkers.|$|E

40|$|Aldose reductase (AR), {{the first}} enzyme in the polyol pathway, has {{been implicated in}} a wide variety of {{physiological}} and pathological functions, such as diabetic vascular and neural complications. It is known that diabetes mellitus can exacerbate brain and retina damage after <b>ischemic</b> <b>injuries.</b> However, the underlying mechanisms are not clear. In the present study, we made use of db/db mice with an AR null mutation (AR-/-db/db) to understand better the role of AR in the pathogenesis of brain and retina <b>ischemic</b> <b>injuries</b> under diabetic conditions. Cerebral and retinal ischemia was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in control and diabetic mice either with or without an AR null mutation. Mice were evaluated for neurological deficits after 30 min of ischemia and 23. 5 hr of reperfusion. Our results showed that the diabetic db/db mice had significantly more severe neurological deficit and larger brain infarct size than the nondiabetic mice. Compared with wild-type db/db mice, the AR-/-db/db mice had significantly lower neurological scores, smaller brain infarct areas, and less hemispheric brain swelling. Retinal swelling was also significantly decreased in the AR -/-db/db mice. Less swelling in the brain and retina of the AR -/-db/db mice correlated with less expression of the water channel aquaporin 4. Taken together, these data clearly show that deletion of AR leads to less severe brain and retinal <b>ischemic</b> <b>injuries</b> in the diabetic db/db mouse.

Increased ICP leads to increased intracranial volume.

2500|$|Bilirubin encephalopathy, {{also known}} as kernicterus, is the {{accumulation}} of bilirubin in the grey matter of the central nervous system. The main accumulation targets of hyperbilirubinemia are the basal ganglia, ocular movement nucleus, and acoustic nucleus of the brainstem. Pathogenesis of bilirubin encephalopathy involves several factors, including the transport of bilirubin across the blood-brain barrier and into neurons. Mild disruption results in left cognition impairment, while severe disruption results in ADCP. Lesions caused by accumulation of bilirubin occur mainly in the global pallidus and hypothalamus. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier by disease or a hypoxic <b>ischemic</b> <b>injury</b> can also contribute to an accumulation of bilirubin in the brain. Bilirubin encephalopathy leading to cerebral palsy has been greatly reduced by effective monitoring and treatment for hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants. [...] As kernicterus has decreased due to improvements in care, over the last 50 years the proportion of children developing athetoid CP has decreased.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that genes, RNAs, and proteins are involved in the occurrence and development of stroke. In addition, previous studies concluded that microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are closely related to the pathological process of ischemic and hypoxic disease. Therefore, the aims of this study were to quantify the altered expression levels of miRNAs in the infarct region 6 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) -induced focal cerebral ischemia in mice using a large-scale miRNAs microarray. Firstly, MCAO-induced cerebral <b>ischemic</b> <b>injuries</b> were investigated by observing the changes of neurological deficits, infarct volume and edema ratio. One hundred and eighteen differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in the infarct region of mice following the MCAOs compared with sham group (p < 0. 05 was considered as significant). Among these 118 significantly expressed microRNAs, we found that 12 miRNAs were up-regulated with fold changes lager than two, and 18 miRNAs were down-regulated with fold changes less than 0. 5 in the infarct region of mice following the 6 h MCAOs, compared with the sham group. Then, these 30 miRNAs with expression in fold change larger than two or less than 0. 5 was predicted, and the functions of the target genes of 30 miRNAs were analyzed using a bioinformatics method. Finally, the miRNA-gene network was established and the functional miRNA-mRNA pairs were identified, which provided insight into the roles of the specific miRNAs that regulated specified genes in the <b>ischemic</b> <b>injuries.</b> The miRNAs identified in this study may represent effective therapeutic targets for stroke, and further study of the role of these targets may increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying <b>ischemic</b> <b>injuries...</b>|$|R

The studies of experimental models of <b>ischemic</b> brain <b>injury</b> are therefore essential for primary and secondary research.
