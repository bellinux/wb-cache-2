25|$|James S. Donnelly, Jr., a {{historian}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, {{wrote in his}} book, Landlord and Tenant in Nineteenth-century Ireland:I would draw the following broad conclusion: at a fairly early stage of the Great Famine the government's abject failure to stop or even slow down the clearances (evictions) contributed {{in a major way}} to enshrining the idea of English state-sponsored genocide in Irish popular mind. Or perhaps one should say in the Irish mind, for this was a notion that appealed to many educated and discriminating men and women, and not only to the revolutionary minority...And it is also my contention that while genocide was not in fact committed, what happened during {{and as a result of}} the clearances <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> genocide to a great many Irish.|$|E

2500|$|Georges Méliès {{attended}} the Lycée Michelet from age seven {{until it was}} bombed during the Franco-Prussian War; he was then sent to the prestigious Lycée Louis-le-Grand. In his memoirs, Méliès emphasised his formal, classical education, in contrast to accusations {{early in his career}} that most filmmakers had been [...] "illiterates incapable of producing anything artistic." [...] However, he acknowledged that his creative instincts usually outweighed intellectual ones: [...] "The artistic passion was too strong for him, and while he would ponder a French composition or Latin verse, his pen mechanically sketched portraits or caricatures of his professors or classmates, if not some fantasy palace or an original landscape that already <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>look</b> <b>of</b> a theatre set." [...] Often disciplined by teachers for covering his notebooks and textbooks with drawings, young Georges began building cardboard puppet theatres at age ten and moved on to craft even more sophisticated marionettes as a teenager. Méliès graduated from the Lycée with a baccalauréat in 1880.|$|E
