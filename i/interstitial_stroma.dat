40|$|The {{distribution}} of laminin was studied during pulmonary fibrosis induced in rodents by bleomycin sulfate. Large accumulations of laminin associated with basement membranes {{were seen in}} thickened lung interstitial spaces by immunofluorescence microscopy, starting at 7 days (32 - 75 % increases) and persisting through 28 days (66 - 79 % increase). By electron microscopy, these laminin concentrations were skeinlike masses of reduplicated basement membranes localized at the surface of alveolar capillary endothelial cells. Numerous macrophages were also associated with this basement membrane material. These findings suggest that bleomycin-induced damage to lung cells causes massive local accumulations of basement membranes, which might {{be involved in the}} expansion of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma</b> by stimulating attachment and activation of certain inflammatory cells...|$|E

40|$|Background: Comparison {{of tissue}} {{microarray}} results of 29 cervical cancer and 27 normal cervix tissue samples using immunohistochemistry revealed considerable {{reorganization of the}} fibrillar stroma of these tumors. Preliminary densitometry analysis of laminin- 1, α -smooth muscle actin (SMA) and fibronectin immunostaining demonstrated 3. 8 -fold upregulation of laminin- 1 and 5. 2 -fold increase of SMA in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma,</b> indicating that these proteins and the activated fibroblasts play {{important role in the}} pathogenesis of cervical cancer. In the present work we investigated the role of normal and tumor-associated fibroblasts. Methods: In vitro models were used to throw light on the multifactorial process of tumor-stroma interaction, by means of studying the cooperation between tumor cells and fibroblasts. Fibroblasts from normal cervix and cervical cancers were grown either separately or in co-culture with CSCC 7 cervical cancer cell line. Changes manifest in secreted glycoproteins, integrins and matrix metallo-proteases (MMPs) were explored. Results: While normal fibroblasts produced components of interstitial matrix and TGF- β 1 that promoted cell proliferation, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) synthesized ample amounts of laminin- 1. The following results support the significance of laminin- 1 in the invasion of CSCC 7 cells: 1.) Tumor-associated fibroblasts produced more laminin- 1 and less components of fibrillar ECM than normal cells; 2.) The production of laminin chains was further increased when CSCC 7 cells were grown in co-culture with fibroblasts; 3.) CSCC 7 cells were capable of increasing their laminin production; 4.) Tumor cells predominantly expressed integrin α 6 β 4 laminin receptors and migrated towards laminin. The integrin profile of both normal and tumor-associated fibroblasts was similar, expressing receptors for fibronectin, vitronectin and osteopontin. MMP- 7 secreted by CSCC 7 cells was upregulated by the presence of normal fibroblasts, whereas MMP- 2 produced mainly by fibroblasts was activated in the presence of CSCC 7 cells. Conclusions: Our results indicate that in addition to degradation of the basement membrane, invasion of cervical cancer is accomplished by the remodeling of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma,</b> which process includes decrease and partial replacement of fibronectin and collagens by a laminin-rich matrix...|$|E
40|$|Apolipoprotein (apo) E, a 35 -kDa protein {{found on}} the surface of several lipoproteins, has been {{detected}} in many peripheral tissues and is postulated to function in facilitating the transfer of cholesterol/lipids between cells. We examined the expression of apo E mRNA in the testes and epididymides of juvenile rats (21 days old), prepubescent rats (34 - 36 days old), and sexually mature rats (75 - 80 days old). In situ hybridization using 5 S-labeled rat apo E riboprobes was used to identify cells containing apo E mRNA. Such cells were located in the interstitial area of testes obtained from rats of all ages. This cell population consisted of primarily Leydig cells with occasional macrophages, according to immunoreactivity to 3 P-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and antimacrophage antibodies, respectively. Caput epididymides obtained from sexually mature and prepubescent rats contained apo E mRNA-positive cells located in the basal region of the epididymal tubules and within the <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma.</b> Our data are consistent with the concept that locally produced apo E plays a role in the physiologic function of the rat testis and epididymis...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of the palatine salivary glands of rabbits was studied employing scanning electron microscopic methods. The fractured surface of the palatine salivary glands revealed that they were formed of small lobuli separated by interlobular spaces containing numerous bundles of collagen fibers. The NaOH treated specimens showed {{the organization of the}} collagen fibrils in their original location. In the <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma</b> compartment, the collagen fibrils revealed a complex three-dimensional arrangement forming channel-like structures for supporting nerve fibers, small vessels and capillaries. Single groups of acinar cells were clearly demonstrated, and each acinus was enveloped by a characteristic basal lamina showing a sponge-like structure made up of several interconnected meshes of collagen fibrils. Furthermore, taking advantage of the ODO method and field emission scanning electron microscopy, within the cytoplasm of secretory acinar cells numerous organelles were clearly observed in a three-dimensional way such as Golgi complex lamellae, rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and secretory granules. All these cytoplasmic components revealed their real and microtopographical arrangement in some areas of the acinar cytoplasm clearly suggesting their direct involvement in energetic as well as secretory activities...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} how the hyaluronan receptor CD 44 regulates tumor metastasis, the murine mammary carcinoma TA 3 /St, which constitutively expresses cell surface CD 44, was transfected with cDNAs encoding soluble isoforms of CD 44 and the transfectants (TA 3 sCD 44) were compared with parental cells (transfected with expression vector only) for growth in vivo and in vitro. Local release of soluble CD 44 by the transfectants inhibited the ability of endogenous cell surface CD 44 to bind and internalize hyaluronan and to mediate TA 3 cell invasion of hyaluronan-producing cell monolayers. Mice intravenously injected with parental TA 3 /St cells developed massive pulmonary metastases within 21 – 28 d, whereas animals injected with TA 3 sCD 44 cells developed few or no tumors. Tracing of labeled parental and transfectant tumor cells revealed that both cell types initially adhered to pulmonary endothelium and penetrated the <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma.</b> However, although parental cells were dividing and forming clusters within lung tissue 48 h following injection, � 80 % of TA 3 sCD 44 cells underwent apoptosis.

The greatly increased occurrence of microliths in the submandibular gland was statistically significant. Microliths in the parasympathectomized submandibular glands were detected by light microscopy most often in ductal lumina, followed by acinar lumina, ductal parenchyma, <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma,</b> and acinar parenchyma.

40|$|Epithelial-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) is {{a crucial}} event in tumor invasion and metastasis. However, most of past EMT {{studies have been conducted}} in the conventional two-dimensional (2 D) monolayer culture. Therefore, it remains unclear what invasive phenotypes are acquired by EMT-induced cancer cells. To address this point, we attempted to characterize EMT cells in more physiological, three-dimensional (3 D) collagen gel culture. EMT was induced by treating three human carcinoma cell lines (A 549, Panc- 1 and MKN- 1) with TGF-ß. The TGF-ß treatment stimulated these cells to overexpress the invasion markers laminin c 2 and MT 1 -MMP in 2 D culture, in addition to the induction of well-known morphological change and EMT marker expression. EMT induction enhanced cell motility and adhesiveness to fibronectin and collagen in 2 D culture. Although EMT cells showed comparable cell growth to control cells in 2 D culture, their growth rates were extremely suppressed in soft agar and collagen gel cultures. Most characteristically, EMT-induced cancer cells commonly and markedly extended invasive protrusions in collagen gel. These protrusions were mainly supported by microtubules rather than actin cytoskeleton. Snail-introduced, stable EMT cells showed similar protrusions in 3 D conditions without TGF-ß. Moreover, these protrusions were suppressed by colchicine or inhibitors of heat shock protein 90 (HSP- 90) and protein phosphatase 2 A. However, MMP inhibitors did not suppress the protrusion formation. These data suggest that EMT enhances tumor cell infiltration into <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma</b> by extending microtubule-based protrusions and suppressing cell growth. The elevate...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada (VKH) {{disease is}} a {{systemic}} autoimmune disorder that affects organs with melanocytes. The sunset glow fundus (SGF) in VKH disease was evaluated with polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT). Methods: The study involved 28 eyes from 14 patients with chronic VKH disease, 21 eyes from 21 age-matched controls, and 22 eyes from 22 high-myopic patients with a tessellated fundus. VKH eyes were grouped into sunset or non-sunset groups {{on the basis of}} color fundus images. The presence of melanin in the choroid was determined by using the degree of polarization uniformity (DOPU) obtained by PS-OCT. The sunset glow index (SGI) was calculated by using color fundus images. Presence of an SGF was evaluated by using DOPU, SGI, subfoveal choroidal thicknesses, near-infrared images, and autofluorescence images at 488 nm (SW-AF) and 785 nm (NIR-AF). Results: There were 16 eyes in the sunset group and 12 eyes in the non-sunset group. For all eyes in the sunset group, the disappearance of choroidal melanin was clearly detected with PS-OCT. Percentage areas of low DOPU in the choroidal <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma</b> of the sunset group were significantly lower than those of other groups and showed no overlap with other groups. The distribution of choroidal thicknesses and SGI in the sunset group substantially overlapped with other groups. The subjective analyses of the sunset and non-sunset groups, using near infrared, SW-AF, or NIR-AF, showed substantial inconsistencies with the PS-OCT results. Conclusions: PS-OCT provides an in vivo objective evaluation of choroidal melanin loss of the SGF in chronic VKH disease...|$|E
40|$|Cartilage, {{bone and}} the <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma,</b> {{composed}} largely of the interstitial collagens, types I, II and III, are remodelled by {{three members of}} the metalloproteinase (MMP) family, collagenase- 1 (MMP- 1), collagenase- 2 (MMP- 8) and collagenase- 3 (MMP- 13). MMP- 1 and MMP- 13 may contribute directly to disease progression, since they are induced in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. The study of MMP- 1 and MMP- 13 gene regulation in models of arthritic disease has been problematic because mice and rats, which are typically used, only possess a homologue of MMP- 13. Here we show that in contrast with mice and rats, rabbits possess distinct genes homologous to human MMP- 1 and MMP- 13. Furthermore, rabbit MMP- 13 is expressed simultaneously with MMP- 1 in chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts in response to the cytokines interleukin- 1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha, or the phorbol ester PMA. The time course of MMP- 13 induction is more rapid and transient than that of MMP- 1, suggesting that distinct mechanisms regulate the expression of these two collagenases. We have cloned the rabbit MMP- 13 gene from synovial fibroblasts and demonstrated that the rabbit gene shares greater homology with human MMP- 13 than does the mouse interstitial collagenase. Together with the fact that mice and rats do not possess a homologue to human MMP- 1, our data suggest that the rabbit provides an appropriate model for studying the roles of interstitial collagenases in connective-tissue diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Alcohol {{consumption}} is an established {{risk factor for}} breast cancer metastasis. Yet, the mechanism by which alcohol promotes breast cancer metastases is unknown. The ability of cancer cells to invade through tissue barriers (such as basement membrane and <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma)</b> is an essential step towards establishing cancer metastasis. In the present study, we identify and examine the roles of two genes, Nm 23 and ITGA 5, in alcoholinduced breast cancer cell invasion. Methods: Human breast cancer T 47 D cells were treated with ethanol at various concentrations. Boyden chamber invasion assays were used to measure cellular invasive ability. The mRNA expression level of metastasis suppressor genes including Nm 23 was determined by qRT-PCR. ITGA 5 was identified using a qRT-PCR array of 84 genes important for cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Nm 23 overexpression in addition to Nm 23 - and ITGA 5 knock-down {{were used to determine}} the role of the Nm 23 -ITGA 5 pathway on cellular invasive ability of T 47 D cells. Protein expression levels were verified by Western blot. Results: Alcohol increased the invasive ability of human breast cancer T 47 D cells in a dose-dependent manner through the suppression of the Nm 23 metastatic suppressor gene. In turn, Nm 23 down-regulation increased expression of fibronectin receptor subunit ITGA 5, which subsequently led to increased cellular invasion. Moreover, Nm 23 overexpression was effective in suppressing the effects of alcohol on cell invasion. In addition, we show that the effects of alcohol on invasion were also inhibited by knock-down of ITGA 5. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the Nm 23 -ITGA 5 pathway plays a critical role in alcohol-induced breast cancer cell invasion. Thus, regulation of this pathway may potentially be used to prevent the establishment of alcohol-promoted metastases in human breast cancers...|$|E

Inhaled carcinogenetic agents like tobacco condensate, minerals, radioactive rays etc. might induce tumor realisation by changing of genetical information. Beside cellular atypia pathognomonic anomalies of extracellular matrix components in preneoplastic lesions of the bronchial mucosa are the foundation for tumor invasion in bronchogenic carcinoma. Within the finished project immunohistochemical, moleculargenetical (in-situ-hybridisation) and electronmicroscopical investigations were performed on tissue specimens of 168 patients to determine structure anomalies of collagen type I, III, IV, NC 1, laminin, fibronectin and human type IV collagenase. Furthermore degree of neovascularisation and inflammatory reactions were investigated. The following results were obtained: 1. With increasing degree of neoplastic transformation features of combined destruction and insufficient production of collagenous and non-collagenous basement membrane structures were found in preneoplastic lesions at the borderline to <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma</b> components. 2. Fibronectin interacts as cell-matrix-ligand during invasion of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma.</b> After binding of tumor cells to the extracellular matrix matrix components are digested by proteolytic enzymes like collagenase type IV. 3. mRNA expression for collagenous and non collagenous basement membrane structures could be detected in mesenchymal cells, monocytes and histiocytes. 4.

40|$|Background: Imatinib causes {{increased}} {{turnover of}} stromal collagen, reduces collagen fibril diameter, enhances extracellular fluid turnover and lowers interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) {{in the human}} colonic carcinoma KAT- 4 /HT- 29 (KAT- 4) xenograft model. Methods: We compared the effects of imatinib on oxygen levels, vascular morphology and IFP in three experimental tumor models differing in their content of a collagenous extracellular matrix. Results: Neither the KAT 4 and CT- 26 colonic carcinoma models, nor B 16 BB melanoma expressed PDGF beta-receptors in the malignant cells. KAT- 4 tumors exhibited a well-developed ECM {{in contrast to the}} other two model systems. The collagen content was substantially higher in KAT- 4 than in CT- 26, while collagen was not detectable in B 16 BB tumors. The pO(2) was on average 5. 4, 13. 9 and 19. 3 mmHg in KAT- 4, CT- 26 and B 16 BB tumors, respectively. Treatment with imatinib resulted in similar pO(2) -levels in all three tumor models but only in KAT- 4 tumors did the increase reach statistical significance. It is likely that after imatinib treatment the increase in pO(2) in KAT- 4 tumors is caused by increased blood flow due to reduced vascular resistance. This notion is supported by the significant reduction observed in IFP in KAT- 4 tumors after imatinib treatment. Vessel area varied between 4. 5 and 7 % in the three tumor models and was not affected by imatinib treatment. Imatinib had no effect on the fraction of proliferating cells, whereas the fraction of apoptotic cells increased to a similar degree in all three tumor models. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the effects of imatinib on pO(2) -levels depend on a well-developed ECM and provide further support to the suggestion that imatinib acts by causing <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma</b> cells to produce a less dense ECM, which would in turn allow for an increased blood flow. The potential of imatinib treatment to render solid tumors more accessible to conventional treatments would therefore depend on the degree of tumor desmoplasia...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. One of the {{promising}} directions of improvement of immunodiagnostic BA recently recognized {{the creation of}} tissue antigens of the respiratory system structures and their use in diagnostic assays to detect subtle disturbances {{in the structure of}} the respiratory system in the development of this disease. Each of the body tissue has an extremely wide range of proteins that characterize its species and organ specificity of the individual. It follows that satisfactory diagnostic results can be obtained only if the isolation of individual proteins characteristic lesion of certain components of the trachea, bronchus and lung tissue. Materials&methods. The results of studies using the blood serum of children with asthma during exacerbations, showed that the resulting diagnostic tools are characterized by mild pretsipitogennymi properties, in consequence of which they can not be used in the passive hemagglutination (PHA) response for diagnostic purposes, since there is a low the percentage of positive reacting sera from children with asthma (23. 7 % - 58. 1 %). Established that were significantly higher than in children patients with asthma for two of the four test diagnostics (nuclear antigen substance and mitochondria) cells of the bronchial mucosa frequency of positive results with serum of healthy children of the control group (63. 0 - 100 %). It is emphasized that except diagnosticum constituting supernatants mitochondria and bronchial mucosa cells, all other antigens differed in TPHA antigenic activity is extremely low, providing a positive result (1 : 0, 87 - 1 : 1, 38), which eliminates them diagnostic significance. It is found that the diagnostic tools derived from the cells of the bronchial mucosa, chemically presented protein components did not significantly differ among themselves antigenic activity in children with asthma, which also negatively affects the possibility of their intended use. On the supernatant antigens and mitochondria of cells in bronchial mucosa RPGA with sera of children with asthma autoantibodies determined in the following credits: supernatants - 1 : 75, 4 - 1 : 108, 2; mitochondria - 1 : 58, 9 - 1 : 82, 4. These results indicate that the test protein as diagnostics antigens bronchial mucosa cells are not able to stimulate development of bronchopulmonary autoantibodies involved in autoimmune manifestations component in children with asthma. Low diagnostic ability of the tested antigens of bronchial mucosa cells in PHA, obviously, is connected with the fact that asthma in children is a chronic non-specific inflammatory process, which is based on the initial changes in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma</b> bronchopulmonary system. Features of asthma development in children can be identified by the use of immunologically relevant tests in tissue antigens, derived from the interstitial connective tissue stroma of bronchopulmonary system. We have tested antigens trachea, bronchi, lung tissue derived from connective tissue interstitial pulmonary system data structures. Antigens were presented lipopolysaccharide. Proteins are composed of antigenic preparations were absent, the peptides were determined only in trace amounts. This diagnostic kit used in the reaction aggregates quantitation immune serum of children with asthma. Immunological examination showed that lipopolysaccharide antigens of the trachea, bronchus and lung tissue, as opposed to protein antigens of cell structures of the bronchial mucosa, possessed high antigenic activity and the ability to detect differential diagnostic differences of clinical forms and degrees of severity of the disease. Thus, the main range of immunological and immunopathological reactions in asthma in children has a clear dependence on the antigen-activated <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma</b> inflammatory bronchopulmonary system. Conclusions. 1. Antigens derived sectional proteinaceous material bronchopulmonary systems can not be obtained industrially, as they are not standardized to protein have not sterile, which greatly limits their use, and reduces the diagnostic value. 2. Multi-antigenic composition of protein homogenates derived from cell-tissue structures of the respiratory system, does not allow to clearly identify the nature of morphological changes in bronchial asthma in children. 3. Lipopolysaccharide antigens from bronchopulmonary structures contain protein in their composition may be prepared industrially under sterile conditions and stored in a lyophilized state for more than two years, which allows to use them widely in the forms and immunodiagnostics clinical severity of asthma in children...|$|E
30|$|The kidney {{develops}} {{from several}} stem cell pools during organogenesis. As in other mammals, the human kidney derives from intermediate mesoderm (IM) and proceeds through three progressive phases, each {{marked by the}} formation of a more advanced kidney: the pronephros, which is a rudimentary and non-functional organ, the mesonephros, which only functions a short time during embryonic development, and the metanephros, which becomes the definitive form of the adult kidney [16]. The basic structural unit of each kidney form is the nephron, an epithelial tube that accomplishes waste excretion. Nephrons have three major parts: (1) a glomerulus that filters the blood, (2) a tubule that modifies the filtrate to reabsorb and secrete solutes as the fluid passes through proximal, intermediate, and distal segments, and (3) a duct that carries the urine into a centralized collecting system [17]. The pronephros and mesonephros are made from IM that develops into simple nephrons that are connected to a pair of nephric (Wolffian) ducts, and these tissues degenerate in succession as the metanephros forms. The metanephric kidney is produced when a localized region of the nephric duct forms an outgrowth known as the ureteric bud (UB). The UB invades the adjacent IM, which at this stage is termed the metanephric mesenchyme (MM), and undergoes reiterative branching morphogenesis to create a complex duct network. The MM aggregates and condenses to form the cap mesenchyme (CM), a self-renewing stem cell population that makes nephrons around the branching UB [18 – 21]. Nephrogenesis proceeds when a cluster of CM undergoes a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) into a renal vesicle. Each renal vesicle will proliferate and undergo morphogenesis to make one nephron. The loosely packed surrounding MM produces <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma.</b> There is ongoing work to characterize the UB and MM derivatives, and to profile genes expressed by subsequent renal cell lineages, with a large focus on the CM because of its self-renewal property [18 – 21]. Although the CM exhibits self-renewal, the CM is transient and the entire CM population is triggered to undergo a final round of nephrogenesis at the end of metanephros formation. There is no evidence that a CM population is maintained to become an adult renal stem cell population. It is currently unknown if self-renewal is a short-lived property of CM renal stem cells and/or if developmental signaling induces all of the CM cells to become renal vesicles that undergo nephrogenesis.|$|E
40|$|The peritubular {{zone of the}} rat testis has an {{extensive}} extracellular matrix (ECM). Fibronectin (FN) is distributed primarily in the basal lamina of the seminiferous tubule boundary tissue and is synthesized by peritubular myoid cells. Several extracellular changes are mediated by growth factors and these changes occur {{at the time of}} hormone mediated testicular development, particularly in the peritubular zone. The effects of serum or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cAMP) on FN production by the mesenchymal peritubular myoid cells were evaluated. Rats of various ages (10, 15, 20, 40 and 80 days) were employed for immunofluorescent localization of rat testicular FN in frozen sections. In all age groups tested, FN was primarily present in a broad layer around each seminiferous tubule, and blood vessel, and in variable distribution throughout the <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma.</b> By day 20 there was no clear distinction in FN staining between the peritubular zone and the interstitial tissue. This indicates an involvement of FN in the ECM developments which occur in the peritubular zone of the testis at this time. The peritubular myoid cells were isolated from 20 - 22 day old rat testis and cultured on glass coverslips. These cells were grown to confluence with 10 % fetal calf serum (FCS) in medium until day 4 and then subcultured to have secondary monocultures maintained with or without serum. By means of immunofluorescence and cytochemistry using avidin-biotin peroxidase complex it was observed that peritubular myoid cells were positive for FN and most of the FN was localized in the perinuclear region. Subcultured peritubular myoid cells maintained for 4 days in medium containing FCS developed {{an extensive}} interconnecting FN matrix. In the presence of 0. 5 mM cAMP in culture, FN became localized along the filamentous process of peritubular myoid cells and more prominently in the areas of triangulated multi-cell aggregates {{as well as on the}} surface of the contracted small spherical cells. The addition of cAMP in the presence of FCS, also caused a noticeable change in the staining pattern; FN was detected along the filamentous process developing into a complex network of cells encased in an extensive matrix. It would appear that the translocation of FN in the cytoplasmic extensions of peritubular myoid cells may be a direct consequence of morphological changes associated with metabolic regulation of cAMP. This may also be related to the puberty associated development of in vivo changes in the ECM produced by peritubular myoid cells...|$|E
40|$|Breast cancer {{metastasis}} is a stepwise process during which cells dissociate {{from the primary}} tumor and migrate through extracellular matrix (ECM) and tissue barriers to spread to secondary sites. Metastasis is initiated when tumor cells acquire a motile phenotype and invade into the stromal ECM surrounding the tumor, which is heterogeneous and contains three-dimensional (3 D) structural features including a diversity of fiber and pore microarchitectures, varying degrees of matrix alignment, and track-like structures. Notably, it is largely unknown whether, or how, these physical cues integrate with intracellular signaling to affect the behavior of invading cells. Furthermore, intratumor heterogeneity and cellular plasticity result in diverse and evolving invasive phenotypes whose molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Thus, despite the clinical importance of understanding and identifying invasive progression, the cellular and extracellular determinants that enable the invasive cancer cell phenotype remain unclear. Here, we study the process of 3 D cancer cell migration within biologically inspired in vitro models that mimic key aspects of the in vivo <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma</b> and demonstrate that {{the structure of a}} cell‟s local ECM regulates its invasive behavior. We show that 3 D ECM microarchitecture controls the acquisition of cell motility by directing subcellular protrusion dynamics. By inducing adhesion signaling-dependent anisotropy of these cellular morphodynamics, aligned matrix guides and accelerates 3 D cell spreading and migration. Furthermore, we find that physiological ECM-free microtracks provide additional pro-invasive cues that substantially reduce the mechanistic burden of 3 D cell migration. We further observe in an in vitro model of intratumor heterogeneity that malignant "leader" cells create invasion-enabling microtracks within 3 D ECM that can induce invasion of otherwise non-invasive "follower" cells. Through further studies, we determine that invasive fitness, which can be heterogeneous across a cell population, is an intrinsic and heritable cell trait. We exploit this finding to establish invasive and non-invasive cancer cell subpopulations, which we subsequently use to identify characteristic molecular and phenotypic attributes of invasive and non-invasive cells. Finally, we explore a potential consequence of "follow-the-leader" invasion and demonstrate that exposure to a stroma-like collagen-rich microenvironment induces mesenchymal gene expression and an invasive phenotype in non-invasive, nontransformed mammary epithelial cells. Together, our findings demonstrate that invasiveness is coordinately determined by a cell‟s intrinsic 3 D migration propensity as well as its local 3 D extracellular matrix, both of which can be heterogeneous across a given tumor-stroma microenvironment. Despite the inevitable complexity that arises from this heterogeneity, these findings contribute to our understanding of invasion-enabling extracellular features as well as the context-dependent molecular mechanisms by which cells to respond to such features during 3 D cancer cell invasion. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|E
40|$|Invasion and {{metastasis}} of malignant {{tumor cells}} requires destruction of and migration through extracellular matrix (ECM) such as basement membrane and <b>interstitial</b> <b>stroma.</b> The ECM-degrading proteases produced by tumor cells and stromal cells and cell motility {{play a crucial}} role in this process. Matrix metalloproreases (MMPs) appear to be particularly important because of their capability to degrade components of ECM. Malignant mesothelioma is an asbestos-associated and highly aggressive tumor arising from mesothelial cell-lined surfaces of body cavities. It is most often present in the pleural cavities. The resulting tumor often forms diffuse thickening of involved surfaces rather than solitary rounded lesions seen in other neoplasms. Malignant mesotheliomas invade and spread through the underlying basement membrane or along serosal surfaces. Metastases occur in up to 75 % of mesothelioma patients. There is no effective and standard treatment for malignant mesothelioma. The general aim of this thesis is understand why malignant mesotheliomas invade surrounding tissues and metastasize. Using human malignant mesothelioma cell lines as a model, the goal of this thesis was to: (i) investigate expression and production of MMPs in malignant mesothelioma cells. All investigated mesothelioma cell lines expressed mRNA for MMP- 1, MMP- 2, MMP- 3, MMP- 9 and 6 / 8 cell lines expressed MMP- 7, 3 / 8 cell lines expressed MMP- 10. MMP- 11 was not detected in any of mesothelioma cell lines tested. MMP - 2 and MMP - 9 produced by mesothelioma cells degraded gelatin, whereas MMP- 3 degraded laminin, fibronectin and vitronectin; (ii) the exposure of malignant mesothelioma cells to different growth factors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), amphiregulin (AR), heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), beta-cellulin (BTC), stem cell factor (SCF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -I, -II, acidic-fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), basic-FGF (bFGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), increased production of MMP- 9 and/or MMP- 3. Production of MMP- 2 was not affected by any growth factors used in this study; (iii) examine the cell motility (chemotaxis and chemokinesis) induced by multiple growth factors in malignant mesothelioma cells. The growth factors such as EGF, TGF-alpha, AR, HB-EGF, BTC, IGF-I, IGF-II and SCF stimulated chemotactic and/or chemokinetic motility in mesothelioma cells tested, whereas none of aFGF, bFGF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) induced migration in the same mesothelioma cells; (iv) study the role of novel EGF receptor-tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) inhibitors (ZD 1839, OSI- 774, CI- 1033) on cell proliferation and invasive behaviour of malignant mesothelioma in vitro. All three drugs inhibited TGF-alpha induced cellular proliferation, cell migration (chemotaxis) and the production of MMP- 9 in three cell lines tested. In conclusion, we have described the expression, production and regulation of MMPs in malignant mesothelioma cells. In addition, our results indicate that MMPs may play a role in malignant mesothelioma cell invasion. Furthermore, cell motility induced by different growth factors may contribute to the highly invasive behaviour of malignant mesothelioma. We have also demonstrated EGFR-TK inhibitors inhibit the proliferation, migration and MMPs production in malignant mesothelioma cells suggesting that these drugs may become an effective treatment strategy for malignant mesothelioma...|$|E
