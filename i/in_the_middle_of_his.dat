At the FBI building, he talks to Skinner, hoping for reassurance. He expresses his fear that, despite Tipet being in a coma, Tipet may {{still be able to}} enter into his dreams.

He begins to thank her for saving his life, but she informs him that Tipet died due to his coma.|$|E
5|$|The {{way this}} man's dark hair grows, with the sharp dip <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> high forehead, as though concentrating {{there all the}} energy of the {{masculine}} M, makes his face different from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the lips are firmly shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression — already suggested by the eyes — of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, reminding us of faces of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, as though this man had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.|$|E

5|$|Does it {{surprise}} {{you that a}} busy man found time to finish so many volumes, many of which deal with such minute details?... He used to begin to study at night on the Festival of Vulcan, not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter he would commence at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and it would come upon him and leave him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work. Before daybreak {{he would go to}} Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.|$|E
5|$|Since Deep Blue's {{victory over}} Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997, IBM {{had been on}} the hunt for a new challenge. In 2004, IBM Research manager Charles Lickel, over dinner with coworkers, noticed that the {{restaurant}} they were in had fallen silent. He soon discovered the cause of this evening hiatus: Ken Jennings, who was then <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> successful 74-game run on Jeopardy!. Nearly the entire restaurant had piled toward the televisions, mid-meal, to watch the phenomenon. Intrigued by the quiz show as a possible challenge for IBM, Lickel passed the idea on, and in 2005, IBM Research executive Paul Horn backed Lickel up, pushing for someone in his department to take up the challenge of playing Jeopardy! with an IBM system. Though he initially had trouble finding any research staff willing to take on what looked to be a much more complex challenge than the wordless game of chess, eventually David Ferrucci took him up on the offer. In competitions managed by the United States government, Watson's predecessor, a system named Piquant, was usually able to respond correctly to only about 35% of clues and often required several minutes to respond. To compete successfully on Jeopardy!, Watson would need to respond in {{no more than a few}} seconds, and at that time, the problems posed by the game show were deemed to be impossible to solve.|$|E
