25|$|A {{spotting}} rifle or ranging gun is a small-calibre rifle {{used as a}} {{sighting device}} for artillery. The ballistics of the spotting rifle are matched {{to those of the}} artillery piece, so that if a shot from the spotting rifle lands on the target, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that the main weapon will also do so.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no other}} known {{references}} to Goodwin but, given his age, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> he was an active player from c.1701 until possibly c.1730 when {{he would have been}} 47. It would seem he played for Sunbury, which was a noted club in the 1720s and early 1730s, and perhaps for Middlesex as a county.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{arguments}} {{could be}} used to describe the effects of pressure on viscosity, where <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that the viscosity is chiefly a function of the volume for liquids with a finite compressibility. An increasing viscosity with rise of pressure is therefore expected. In addition, if the volume is expanded by heat but reduced again by pressure, the viscosity remains the same.|$|E
2500|$|European {{colonisation}} of New Zealand, {{particularly by}} British settlers, {{began in earnest}} after 1800. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> safely <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that cricket <b>was</b> first played there soon after the English arrived.|$|R

50|$|As the {{regiment}} has the geographical name Wessex {{in its name}} and Exeter castle on its cap badge, it can <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that it <b>is</b> from the west of England.

25|$|Traditionally, Muslims believe body desecration in life {{or death}} to be forbidden, and thus many reject organ transplant. However most Muslim {{authorities}} nowadays accept the practice if another life will be saved. As an example, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> {{in countries such as}} Singapore with a cosmopolitan populace that includes Muslims, a special Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura governing body is formed to look after the interests of Singapore's Muslim community over issues that includes their burial arrangements.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} of historic mining activity in two locations on Great Dodd in efforts to exploit such mineral veins. Fornside Mine on the western slopes consisted of two levels, one of which shows signs of copper ore, the other was on a barren quartz vein. At the base of Wolf Crags there are {{the remains of a}} short level 30m long on a poor quartz vein. There are no historical records of this level. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that both mines were commercial failures.|$|E
25|$|The first clear {{evidence}} of hair or fur is in fossils of Castorocauda and Megaconus, from 164M {{years ago in the}} mid-Jurassic. As both extant mammals, Megaconus and Castorocauda have a double coat of hair, with both guard hairs and an undercoat, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that their last common ancestor did as well. This animal must have been Triassic as it was an ancestor of the Triassic Tikitherium. More recently, the discovery of hair remnants in Permian coprolites pushes back the origin of mammalian hair much further back in the synapsid line to Paleozoic therapsids.|$|E
5000|$|The Emperor {{received}} {{yesterday and}} to-day General Baron von Beck ... <b>It</b> <b>may</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> with some {{confidence that the}} terms of a feasible solution are maturing themselves in His Majesty's mind and may form the basis of further negotiations with Hungarian party leaders when the Monarch goes again to Budapest.|$|R
60|$|No answer {{has ever}} been given to these questions. And as the law of {{continuity}} is as much opposed, as is the common sense of mankind, {{to the notion that}} all animals <b>are</b> unconscious machines, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> safely <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that no sufficient answer ever will be given to them.|$|R
60|$|But <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{confidently}} <b>assumed</b> {{that the}} things brought up will very frequently be zoological novelties; or, better still, zoological antiquities, which, in the tranquil and little-changed depths of the ocean, have escaped the causes of destruction {{at work in the}} shallows, and represent the predominant population of a past age.|$|R
25|$|This {{leads to}} Maimonides’ notion that God cannot be {{described}} in any positive terms, but rather only in negative conceptions. The Jewish Encyclopedia notes his view that “As to His essence, {{the only way to}} describe it is negatively. For instance, He is not physical, nor bound by time, nor subject to change, etc. These assertions do not involve any incorrect notions or assume any deficiency, while if positive essential attributes are admitted <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that other things coexisted with Him from eternity.” Unrestrained anthropomorphism and perception of positive attributes is seen as a transgression as serious as idolatry, because both are fundamental errors in the metaphysics of God’s role in the universe, and that is {{the most important aspect of}} the world.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} how or when the trace is placed upon a child, though <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that it begins either when the child begins to show magical talent or when they first go through the barrier to Platform 9¾. The Ministry {{seemingly}} ignores the trace {{during the school year}} as students at Hogwarts are expected to perform magic and are under the supervision of teachers. This 'blind eye' also seems to be extended to places such as Diagon Alley, Platform 9¾, the Hogwarts Express and the village of Hogsmeade (the only settlement in Britain inhabited solely by wizards and other magical beings) which is located close to Hogwarts and which 3rd year students and above can visit on weekends provided they have a signed permission slip from their parent or guardian. The Ministry also seems to {{turn a blind eye to}} the use magic in the muggle-world when the child is under the age of 11 as their powers have generally not been developed enough to cause a problem, with a number of witches and wizards, including Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Lily Evans and Severus Snape all known to have performed some under-age magic while growing up in the muggle-world that went unpunished.|$|E
25|$|Eigen {{made several}} {{assumptions}} about conditions {{that led to}} the formation of the first hypercycles. Some of them were the consequence of the lack of knowledge about ribozymes, which were discovered a few years after the introduction of the hypercycle concept and negated Eigen's assumptions in the strict sense. The primary of them was that the formation of hypercycles had required the availability of both types of chains: nucleic acids forming a quasispecies population and proteins with enzymatic functions. Nowadays, taking into account the knowledge about ribozymes, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that a hypercycle's members were selected from the quasispecies population and the enzymatic function was performed by RNA. According to the hypercycle theory, the first primitive polymerase emerged precisely from this population. As a consequence, the catalysed replication could exceed the uncatalysed reactions, and the system could grow faster. However, this rapid growth was a threat to the emerging system, as the whole system could lose control over the relative amount of the RNAs with enzymatic function. The system required more reliable control of its constituents—for example, by incorporating the coupling of essential RNAs into a positive feedback loop. Without this feedback loop, the replicating system would be lost. These positive feedback loops formed the first hypercycles.|$|E
6000|$|The {{question}} of Manchuria and Inner Mongolia was not raised at Washington. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that Japan's position there is secure {{until such time}} as the Chinese, or the Russians, or both together, are strong enough to challenge it. America, at any rate, will not raise the question unless friction occurs on some other issue. (See Appendix.) ...|$|R
30|$|From a {{procedural}} perspective, this case demonstrates {{the importance of}} thorough interrogation of both the celiac and SMA axes during mesenteric angiogram. Upon initial nonvisualization of a GDA on celiac angiography, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>assumed</b> that the GDA was in spasm or constricted secondary to epinephrine injection. However, secondary SMA angiography was critical in revealing the bleeding replaced GDA.|$|R
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the entire}} system of {{measurement}} corresponds almost exactly with the Babylonian system, and in all probability the Israelite measurement system {{was derived from the}} Babylonian measurement system, with some lesser level of influence from the Egyptian system. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that the relationship between the Israelite measurements and contemporary units {{is the same as the}} relationship between the Babylonian system and contemporary units.|$|R

50|$|In {{imperial}} {{times we}} find an immense {{number of persons}} named Julius; but it must not be supposed that they were connected by descent in any way with the Julia gens; for, in consequence of the imperial family belonging to this gens, it became {{the name of their}} numerous freedmen, and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have <b>been</b> <b>assumed</b> by many other persons out of vanity and ostentation.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{situation}} in which measures of prohibition would be [...] "appropriate" [...] {{for the protection of}} public health and welfare might exist where the members of the medical profession administered or prescribed drugs in Schedule IV in an unduly extensive way, and other less radical measures, such as warnings by public authorities, professional associations or manufacturers, <b>were</b> ineffective. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> however <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that such a situation could rarely if ever arise.|$|R

2500|$|In any case, this midrash may be {{considered}} older and more original than the Midrash Abba Gorion to the Book of Esther.

50|$|Again, {{the lack}} of post-cranial remains makes it {{difficult}} to determine how O. turkae behaved. The fossils were not associated with any females of the species so it could be suggested that the males, at least, <b>were</b> solitary. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>assumed</b> that O. turkae climbed trees, possibly to feed or to avoid predation, although their suggested large body size may have made climbing difficult.
