50|$|This {{system of}} locking cannot {{function}} in a crop pathosystem in which the host population has genetic uniformity. A crop pathosystem is usually the equivalent of every door in the town having the same lock, and every householder having the same key which fits every lock. A system of locking is ruined by uniformity, and {{this is exactly what}} we have achieved when protecting our genetically uniform crops with vertical resistance. It also explains why vertical resistance is temporary resistance in agriculture. This type of error is called sub-optimization and it results from working at too low a systems level. The system of locking is an emergent property that is observable only at the systems level of the pathosystem. Comparable biological emergents are the schooling of fish, and the flocking of birds, which cannot be observed at any systems level below that of the population. The n/2 model is also the most important hypothesis to emanate from the concept of the pathosystem. It can also be argued that the gene-for-gene relationship must function on a basis of heterogeneity in the wild pathosystem because the <b>gross</b> <b>instability</b> of the 'boom and bust' of modern plant breeding would have no evolutionary survival value.|$|E

These patients were selected from a total group of 88 patients undergoing proximal femoral replacement, 75 of whom did not require capsular replacement (none of these 75 patients have experienced dislocation). In the group requiring capsular reconstruction, 1 of 4 patients with bipolar hemiarthroplasty and 4 of 9 patients with total hip replacements experienced dislocation after operation. Of the dislocated total hip replacements, 1 remains chronically dislocated, and 3 were successfully stabilized by open reduction with further capsular augmentation.

A constrained elbow prosthesis was implanted in all three patients. This short series illustrates mid-term failure to be expected with total elbow allografts, mainly due to instability.

40|$|Although total elbow {{arthroplasty}} is {{a reliable}} treatment method for the arthritic joint, revision is necessary if loosening, instability, wear, fracture or infection occurs. We report 12 patients with 19 months (10 - 29) follow-up after revision arthroplasty for painful loosening in six cases, periprosthetic fracture in three, <b>gross</b> <b>instability</b> in one and skin perforation with possible infection in two.

40|$|A {{study of}} {{excision}} arthroplasty (Girdlestone’s pseudarthrosis) for infected total hip replacements is presented. Twenty-two patients were reviewed {{with a minimum}} follow-up of one year. Reduction in pain was significant but the functional results were poor.

40|$|Previous {{experimental}} investigations, {{carried out}} at Alta/Centrospazio in collaboration with Consorzio RFX, on magnetic and electrostatic fluctuations in gas-fed MPD thrusters (both self and applied field), have shown that <b>gross</b> magnetohydrodynamic <b>instabilities</b> develop whenever the current rises beyond a threshold value.

In particular, it is shown that a significant decrease in the applied voltage driving the discharge with no significant variation of thrust is observed when these instabilities are suppressed. The suppression has been obtained by means of a passive system (patent pending), consisting in an insulating plate, axially inserted into the discharge chamber of the thruster. The plate divides the discharge chamber in two halves and interrupts the helical currents produced by the kink, effectively stabilizing the kink itself...|$|R
30|$|A {{sub-section}} {{of these}} injuries need operative intervention. The indications for these are well documented and include open fractures and intra-articular incarceration of fractured fragments with an often subluxated elbow [1]. Relative surgical indications include associated ulnar nerve dysfunction and <b>gross</b> elbow <b>instability</b> [2, 3]. What intrigues most clinicians are cases {{that do not}} clearly meet the above distinct surgical indications. There {{is no question that}} the existing literature, in many ways, is responsible for this dispute. Traditional teaching has been that medial epicondyle fractures may be successfully managed non-operatively with good or excellent functional results, even when healed with fibrous union [4]. In recent years, there is growing consensus that those fractures that exhibit greater displacement (> 2  mm) may benefit from open reduction and internal fixation [5, 6, 7], while fractures that are non- or minimally displaced (generally < 2  mm) may be treated non-operatively [1, 8] with good functional outcomes. Interestingly, there are several studies which report that the results are not significantly different with surgical and non-surgical modalities of treatment [9, 10, 11, 12].|$|R
40|$|DNA {{replication}} is tightly regulated, but paradoxically {{there is}} reported to be an excess of MCM DNA replication proteins over the number of replication origins. Here, we show that MCM levels in primary human T cells are induced during the G(0) [...] >G(1) transition and are not in excess in proliferating cells. The level of induction is critical as we show that a 50 % reduction leads to increased centromere separation, premature chromatid separation (PCS) and gross chromosomal abnormalities typical of genomic instability syndromes. We investigated the mechanisms involved and show that a reduction in MCM levels causes dose-dependent DNA damage involving activation of ATR & ATM and Chk 1 & Chk 2. There is increased DNA mis-repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and both NHEJ and homologous recombination are necessary for Mcm 7 -depleted cells to progress to metaphase. Therefore, a simple reduction in MCM loading onto DNA, which occurs in cancers as a result of aberrant cell cycle control, is sufficient to cause PCS and <b>gross</b> genomic <b>instability</b> within one cell cycle...|$|R

Excellent knee function had a full range of stable, painless motion; good, flexion to 90 ° or more with slight instability or pain; fair, flexion of 45 to 90 ° with mild instability or pain, and poor, flexion of less than 45 ° with <b>gross</b> <b>instability</b> and pain. It was modified to include the presence of extensor lag, a flexion deformity or use of walking aids or braces. A deduction of one category was incurred if any one of these factors was present. Extensor weakness or lag {{was defined as}} an inability to achieve normal extension at knee joint actively. However, the knee could be extended passively. In flexion deformity, passive knee extension was also absent.|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveMeasure incongruity and instability-associated {{changes in}} {{transient}} contact stress directional gradients {{in a human}} cadaveric ankle model. MethodsSeven cadaveric ankles were subjected to quasi-physiologic forces and motion under intact conditions and with a stepoff incongruity of the anterior one-third of the distal tibia. Anterior/posterior forces were modulated to create incongruous specimens that either maintained a stable articulation between the talus and distal tibia or developed <b>gross</b> <b>instability</b> during motion. Real-time contact stresses were measured using a custom-designed ankle stress transducer at 132 Hz. Contact stress data were differentiated using a central-differencing formula to calculate transient contact stress directional gradients over the entire ankle articulation. ResultsTransient 95 th percentile contact stress directional gradient values increased by 30 and 100 %, respectively, in stable-incongruous and unstable-incongruous conditions compared to intact conditions. Compared to stable-incongruous conditions, transient contact stress directional gradients increased by 60 % in unstable-incongruous conditions.

40|$|Albeit genetically highly heterogeneous, muscular dystrophies (MDs) share a {{convergent}} pathology {{leading to}} muscle wasting accompanied by proliferation of fibrous and fatty tissue, suggesting a common MD–pathomechanism. Here {{we show that}} mutations in muscular dystrophy genes (Dmd, Dysf, Capn 3, Large) lead to the spontaneous formation of skeletal muscle-derived malignant tumors in mice, presenting as mixed rhabdomyo-, fibro-, and liposarcomas. Primary MD–gene defects and strain background strongly influence sarcoma incidence, latency, localization, and gender prevalence. Combined loss of dystrophin and dysferlin, as well as dystrophin and calpain- 3, leads to accelerated tumor formation. Irrespective of the primary gene defects, all MD sarcomas share non-random genomic alterations including frequent losses of tumor suppressors (Cdkn 2 a, Nf 1), amplification of oncogenes (Met, Jun), recurrent duplications of whole chromosomes 8 and 15, and DNA damage. Remarkably, these sarcoma-specific genetic lesions are already regularly present in skeletal muscles in aged MD mice even prior to sarcoma development.

40|$|DNA-aneuploidy {{may reflect}} the {{malignant}} nature of mesenchymal proliferations and herald <b>gross</b> genomic <b>instability</b> as a mechanistic factor in tumor genesis. DNA-ploidy and -index were determined by flow cytometry in canine inflammatory or neoplastic mesenchymal tissues and related to clinico-pathological features, biological behavior and p 53 gene mutational status. Half of all sarcomas were aneuploid. Benign mesenchymal neoplasms were rarely aneuploid and inflammatory lesions not at all. The aneuploidy rate was comparable to that reported for human sarcomas with significant variation amongst subtypes. DNA-ploidy status in canines lacked a relation with histological grade of malignancy, in contrast to human sarcomas. While aneuploidy {{was related to the}} development of metastases in soft tissue sarcomas it was not in osteosarcomas. No relation amongst sarcomas was found between ploidy status and presence of P 53 gene mutations. Heterogeneity of the DNA index between primary and metastatic sarcoma sites was present in half of the cases examined. Hypoploidy is more common in canine sarcomas and hyperploid cases have less deviation of the DNA index than human sarcomas. The variation in the presence and extent of aneuploidy amongst sarcoma subtypes indicates variation in genomic instability.

40|$|Background: Conservative {{treatment}} of simple elbow dislocations {{can lead to}} complications such as persisting pain and restricted joint mobility. The current aim was to identify patients with deteriorated outcome after conservative treatment and to investigate a possible association with initial joint (in) stability. Methods: Sixty-eight patients (mean age 37. 1 [*]±[*] 17. 2  years) with simple elbow dislocations received conservative treatment. After closed reduction, joint stability was tested by varus and valgus stress under fluoroscopy. According to the findings under fluoroscopy, three different groups of instability could be identified: (1) slight instability (joint angulation < 10 °; n[*]=[*] 49), (2) moderate instability (angulation ≥ 10 °; n[*]=[*] 19) and (3) <b>gross</b> <b>instability.</b> Patients with <b>gross</b> <b>instability</b> (re-dislocation under stability testing) were treated with primary surgical ligament repair and therefore excluded from this study. Additionally, MRIs and radiographs were analysed regarding warning signs of instability such as the drop sign and joint incongruence. Main outcome parameters were the Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), range of motion (ROM), complications and revision rates. Results: After 40. 7 [*]±[*] 20. 4  months, the overall MEPS was excellent (94. 2 [*]±[*] 11. 3) with a trend of slightly worse clinical results in group 2 (95. 8 [*]±[*] 9. 0 vs. 90. 0 [*]±[*] 15. 2 points; p[*]=[*] 0. 154). In group 1, significantly more patients achieved an excellent result regarding the MEPS scoring system (77. 6 vs. 52. 6  %; p[*]=[*] 0. 043) and elbow extension was significantly worse in group 2 (5. 3 [*]±[*] 9. 9 ° vs. 1. 4 [*]±[*] 3. 0 °; p[*]=[*] 0. 015). Seven treatment complications occurred in group 2 (36. 8  %) compared with two in group 1 (4. 1  %, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). Six patients (8. 8  %) needed secondary surgery with an 8. 4 -fold higher risk for revision surgery in group 2 (p[*]=[*] 0. 007). The presence of a positive drop sign or joint incongruence led to higher odds ratio (OR) for complications (OR[*]=[*] 15. 9) and revision surgery (OR[*]=[*] 10. 3).

There is a low incidence of neurological injury, which seems paradoxical in the presence of what appears to be <b>gross</b> <b>instability,</b> but protection from extremes of flexion and extension may be adequate treatment. Union is usual regardless of displacement. Traction is a safe means of treatment, but early walking in a halo support reduces time in hospital without jeopardising the result.

In this study the Doppler spectrum of the first dorsal metatarsal artery was used to monitor the activity of the disease activity and served as a guideline for management. A total of 15 patients (seven men and eight women) with acute diabetic Charcot arthropathy of the foot and ankle were immobilised in a non-weight-bearing cast. They were followed at two-week intervals and bilateral Doppler spectra of the first dorsal metatarsal arteries were obtained using a 10 MHz linear ultrasound probe.

40|$|In {{colorectal}} tumorigenesis, loss {{of function}} of the mismatch repair genes is closely associated with genomic instability at the nucleotide level whereas p 53 deficiency has been linked with <b>gross</b> chromosomal <b>instability.</b> We have addressed the contribution of these two forms of genetic instability to tumorigenesis using mice mutant for Msh 2 and p 53. As previously reported, deficiency of both genes leads to rapid lymphomagenesis Here we show that heterozygosity for p 53 also markedly reduces survival on an Msh 2 null background. We characterized the patterns of genomic instability in a small set of tumours and showed that, as predicted p 53 deficiency predisposes to aneuploidy and Msh 2 deficiency leads to microsatellite instability (MSI). However, heterozygosity for p 53 {{in the absence of}} Msh 2 resulted in increased MSI and not aneuploidy. This implied role for p 53 in modulating MSI was confirmed using a large cohort of primary fibroblast clones. The differences observed were highly significant (P < 0. 01) in both the fibroblast clones (which all retained p 53 functionality) and the tumours, a proportion of which retained p 53 functionality. Our results therefore demonstrate a dose sensitive role for p 53 in the maintenance of genomic integrity at the nucleotide level...|$|R

Rassf 1 A null fibroblasts did not show increased sensitivity to microtubule poisons or DNA-damaging agents and showed no evidence of <b>gross</b> genomic <b>instability,</b> suggesting that cellular responses to genotoxins were unaffected. Rassf 1 A null mice showed an increased incidence of spontaneous tumorigenesis and decreased survival rate compared with wild-type mice.

40|$|Breast cancers {{frequently}} progress or relapse during targeted therapy, but {{the molecular}} mechanisms that enable escape remain poorly understood. We elucidated genetic determinants underlying tumor escape in a {{transgenic mouse model}} of Wnt pathway–driven breast cancer, wherein targeted therapy is simulated by abrogating doxycycline-dependent Wnt 1 transgene expression within established tumors. In mice with intact tumor suppressor pathways, tumors typically circumvented doxycycline withdrawal by reactivating Wnt signaling, either via aberrant (doxycycline-independent) Wnt 1 transgene expression or via acquired somatic mutations in the gene encoding β-catenin. Germline introduction of mutant tumor suppressor alleles into the model altered the timing and mode of tumor escape. Relapses occurring {{in the context of}} null Ink 4 a/Arf alleles (disrupting both the p 16 Ink 4 a and p 19 Arf tumor suppressors) arose quickly and rarely reactivated the Wnt pathway. In addition, Ink 4 a/Arf-deficient relapses resembled p 53 -deficient relapses in that both displayed morphologic and molecular hallmarks of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Notably, Ink 4 a/Arf deficiency promoted relapse in the absence of <b>gross</b> genomic <b>instability.</b> Moreover, Ink 4 a/Arf-encoded proteins differed in their capacity to suppress oncogene independence. Isolated p 19 Arf deficiency mirrored p 53 deficiency in that both promoted rapid, EMT-associated mammary tumor escape, whereas isolated p 16 Ink 4 a deficiency failed to accelerate relapse. Thus, p 19 Arf/p 53 pathway lesions may promote mammary cancer relapse even when inhibition of a targeted oncogenic signaling pathway remains in force...|$|R
