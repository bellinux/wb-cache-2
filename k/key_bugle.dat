Rawdon had also done his duty, and the guests, who were aware of the sudden manner in which the whole affair had arisen, wondered at the magic which had produced a result worthy of a week's preparation. But it is a great thing to be a young Duke. The pasties, and the venison, and the game, the pines, and the peaches, and the grapes, the cakes, and the confectionery, and the ices, which proved that the still-room at Hauteville was not an empty name, were all most popular. But the wines, they were marvellous! And as the finest cellars in the country had been ransacked for excellence and variety, it is not wonderful that their produce obtained a panegyric. There was hock of a century old, which made all stare, though we, for our part, cannot see, or rather taste, the beauty of this antiquity. Wine, like woman, in our opinion, should not be too old, so we raise our altar to the infant Bacchus; {{but this is not the}} creed of the million, nor was it the persuasion of Sir Chetwode Chetwode or of Sir Tichborne Tichborne, good judges both. The Johannisberger quite converted them. They no longer disliked the young Duke. They thought him a fool, to be sure, but at the same time a good-natured one. In the meantime, all were interested, and Carlstein with his <b>key</b> <b>bugle,</b> from out a neighbouring brake, afforded the only luxury that was wanting.|$|E

50|$|Most woodwind {{instruments}} rely on tone {{holes to}} produce different pitches. Two exceptions are the slide whistle and the overtone flutes. Most brass instruments use valves or a slide instead of tone holes, with the rare <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle</b> and the ophicleide as exceptions.|$|R
25|$|Keyed or Fingered brass {{instruments}} used holes along {{the body of}} the instrument, which were covered by fingers or by finger-operated pads (keys) in a similar way to a woodwind instrument. These included the cornett, serpent, ophicleide, <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle</b> and <b>keyed</b> trumpet. They are more difficult to play than valved instruments.|$|R
50|$|Besses o' th' Barn Band was in {{existence}} by 1818 and probably originally called Clegg's Reed Band, after a local cotton manufacturer and <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle</b> player, John Clegg. It {{may have been}} called Stand Band for a period soon after that. Stand {{is an area of}} Whitefield close to Besses o' th' Barn.|$|R
5000|$|The {{instruments}} used by {{the band}} {{in its early years}} were more varied than later became the case. Describing the Besses assemblage of 1818 as [...] "extraordinarily haphazard", J. H. Elliot lists among its instruments the bass horn, clarinet, drums, French horn, <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle,</b> piccolo, trombone, and trumpet. In 1853, Besses became an all-brass band.|$|R
50|$|Despite his {{conservative}} style {{he was happy}} to explore the possibilities of new instruments, such as his Variationen für das neu erfundene Klappenhorn (Variations for the newly invented <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle).</b> He was a skilled writer for brass instruments and had a particular interest in new developments; he was himself responsible for a form of chromatic horn.|$|R
5000|$|Edward [...] "Ned" [...] Kendall (March 1, 1808 in Fort Wolcott, Goat Island, Rhode Island [...] - [...] October 26, 1861 in Boston) was a bandleader and {{musician}} {{who played the}} <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle.</b> He {{was known for his}} Boston Brass Band, itself a pioneer in all-brass bands, and for a trumpet-playing showdown with the former leader of the Boston Brigade Band, Patrick Gilmore. He was also known for his silver bugle, a gift from Queen Victoria.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Halliday, a Dubliner, {{is notable}} for having {{introduced}} the <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle</b> in 1810. While not a technical innovation (the keyed trumpet was already known), it did become extremely {{popular in the}} burgeoning brass band tradition and inspired a whole family of instruments, the ophicleides. In {{the middle of the}} 19th century, Irish bandleader Patrick Sarsfield Gilmore was very influential, having introduced a wide range of reed instruments as well as developing instrumentation that allowed a large wind ensemble to approximate the effects of a full orchestra.|$|R
5000|$|Kendall formed or took {{leadership}} of the Boston Brass Band in 1835, {{at a time when}} band instruments were changing. He played the <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle,</b> an instrument first made by Nathan Adams of Lowell, Massachusetts, c. 1825. The instruments had become popular with bands very soon, and were common by 1830. Ned was considered among the best on his chosen instrument, and his death seen as the [...] "end of an era" [...] for the instrument, as the valved cornet took over in the bands.|$|R

5000|$|Francis [...] "Frank" [...] Johnson {{was born}} in Martinique in the West Indies and immigrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1809 {{by the age of}} 17. He {{directed}} military bands and society dance orchestras, taught music, and performed on the violin and <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle.</b> His early career consisted of performing for balls, parades, and dancing schools. He first became widely known in 1818 when George Willig published Johnson's Collection of New Cotillions. His career flourished in the 1820s, as he performed arrangements of [...] "fashionable" [...] music for most of the major dance functions in Philadelphia. In 1837 Johnson and a small ensemble of African American musicians sailed to England {{to take part in the}} celebrations surrounding the ascent of Queen Victoria to the British throne. While there, he was exposed to the promenade concert style. When Johnson returned from England in 1838 he introduced this new style of concert in Philadelphia during the Christmas season.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, the Torrey Pines Music Department {{was led by}} Ralph T. Dudgeon, who was at {{the time}} {{studying}} for his Ph.D. at U.C.S.D. Dudgeon frequently mentored students one-on-one on their instruments and on the interpretation and reading of music. He became a foremost expert and virtuoso of the <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle</b> and many of his students remember his incessant practicing in his small office adjacent to the band room during off-class hours. During this time, there was a beginning band class as well as a concert/marching band, a choir, and a jazz ensemble, all taught by Dudgeon. Those who signed up for concert band were required to perform in the marching band at football games (held at San Dieguito High School stadium) as well as marching competitions and parades (i.e. La Mirada Band Review in La Mirada CA). The band traveled in school busses along with the drill team, with whom they frequently performed. In addition there was a pep band consisting of volunteers who played at various school activities such as basketball games and assemblies. The Jazz ensemble performed at numerous jazz festivals (such as the Cypress Jazz Festival in Cypress, CA) in and around southern california.|$|R
50|$|Mellophone <b>bugles</b> <b>keyed</b> in G were {{manufactured}} for American {{drum and}} bugle corps from approximately the 1950s until around 2000 when Drum Corps International {{changed the rules}} to allow brass instruments in any key; however, Kanstul and Dynasty still make them in small quantities.|$|R
5000|$|Francis [...] "Frank" [...] Johnson (June 16, 1792 - April 6, 1844) was an American {{musician}} and prolific composer during the Antebellum period. African American composers were {{rare in the}} U.S. during this period, but Johnson was among the few who were successful. Performing as a virtuoso of the (now rare) <b>keyed</b> Kent <b>bugle</b> and the violin, he wrote {{more than two hundred}} compositions of various styles—operatic airs, Ethiopian minstrel songs, patriotic marches, ballads, cotillions, quadrilles, quicksteps and other dances. Only manuscripts and piano transcriptions survive today.|$|R
50|$|In 1845, Bombardier Henry Lawson, one of {{the finest}} {{trumpeters}} in the country, and principal trumpet of both the Royal Artillery Band and the Royal Artillery Brass Band, was appointed as Trumpet-Major of the Royal Horse Artillery Band in 1845. Lawson, who joined the RA Band in 1823, was frequently compared with Koenig, the famous cornet player of Julien's band. The Band improved considerably under his direction. He was succeeded, after his retirement in 1852 by Trumpet-Major George Collins, the brother of William Collins, bandmaster of the Royal Artillery Band. Collins introduced to the band, an instrument that he had helped to develop many years earlier, the 'keyed bugle' link to a history of the <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle</b> may be found in §7 below see esp. P.21. The first bandmaster of the RHA band was James Browne, who was formerly principal flautist, and a violinist in the RA Band at Woolwich, who succeeded Collins in January 1870. Meanwhile, by the year 1869, so many brass instruments had been added to the band of buglers, that the title was changed to the Royal Artillery Brass Band. The RA Brass Band entered the lists of the Crystal Palace Band Contest in 1871, where it won the first prize of £50.|$|R
5000|$|The ophicleide {{was invented}} in 1817 and {{patented}} in 1821 by French instrument maker Jean Hilaire Asté (also known as Halary or Haleri) as an extension to the <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle</b> or Royal Kent bugle family. It was the structural cornerstone of the brass section of the Romantic orchestra, often replacing the serpent, a Renaissance instrument which {{was thought to be}} outdated. Its long tubing bends back on itself, and it is played with a cupped mouthpiece similar to modern trombone and euphonium mouthpieces. It originally had nine keys, later expanded to as many as twelve keys, covering the large tone holes. Examples exist in E♭, C, B♭, and A♭ (soprano), F and E♭ (alto or quinticlave), B♭ and C (bass), and F or E♭ (contrabass). The most common members are the bass ophicleides pitched in B or C. Soprano and contrabass instruments are very rare. Adolphe Sax and the modern maker Robb Stewart have built examples of soprano ophicleides an octave above the bass. Currently, only five contrabass ophicleides are known to exist. Three are in museums, and two are privately owned: one in Cooperstown, New York and one in Petaluma, California. Those in private hands were both made by Robb Stewart and are the only playable examples.|$|R
50|$|Two {{specific}} {{advantages that}} the Royal Artillery Band and Orchestra have over all other bands, owing to its unequalled long, and continuous history, are its music libraries, and collection of musical instruments. The two libraries, one {{devoted to the}} military band, {{and the other to}} the orchestra, are the largest private music libraries in the United Kingdom. Many rare publications are in the Band's possession, that were purchased upon, or soon after publication, during times when all new publications were purchased by them as a matter of course. The libraries have also included original manuscript scores and parts, by Mozart, Haydn, and C.P.E. Bach, all dating from the visits by these composers to London, and by Beethoeven through his London-based publisher. Later, printed scores by Smetana, Zavertal, and Dvořák were presented to the band. Among the orchestra's collection of stringed instruments, were complete quartets and sets of Italian instruments by Landolfi, Gofriller, Rogeri, and others, as well as by English luthiers, Norman, Banks, Craske, and William Forster - all commissioned by the band during the lifetimes of these makers. Several instruments purchased from the firm Hawkes & Son, during {{the early part of the}} twentieth century, have seen their labels be removed to reveal underneath them, that these were made by such makers as Pedrazzini, and Fagnola. Instruments by all of these makers are highly sought today. Nowadays, instruments are purchased by the Corps of Army Music, at Kneller Hall. Certain instruments owe their very development to the Royal Artillery, such as the modern French horn, and the cornet (developed from the <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle</b> derived from the post horn, first designed, and manufactured for the Royal Artillery Brass Band).|$|R
50|$|The bugles {{utilized}} in modern drum corps are distinguished from their marching band counterparts mostly by their key: <b>bugles</b> are <b>keyed</b> in G; band instruments are <b>keyed</b> in B. <b>Bugle</b> voices are grouped and referenced by the equivalent voices in a choir (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Bass). The naming conventions for these various instruments can be confusing however, {{due to the}} evolution of the bugles used in the drum and bugle corps activity.|$|R
5000|$|In January 1793, two {{troops of}} Royal Horse Artillery were raised, each being {{provided}} with two drummers [...] "who also played upon the bugle-horn". In 1797 trumpeters were designated to these permanent troops. The band was supported financially solely by the officers of that regiment. At {{the advent of}} the nineteenth century, an unofficial mounted band is known to have existed in the regiment, because records show that it was supported and funded by the officers of that branch of the army, being under the charge of one Trumpet-Major Hall. In 1845, Bombardier Henry Lawson, one of the finest trumpeters in the country, and principal trumpet of both the Royal Artillery Band and the Royal Artillery Brass Band, was appointed as Trumpet-Major of the Royal Horse Artillery Band in 1845. Lawson, who joined the RA Band in 1823, was frequently compared with Koenig, the famous cornet player of Jullien's band. The Band improved considerably under his direction. He was succeeded, after his retirement in 1852 by Trumpet-Major George Collins, the brother of William Collins, bandmaster of the Royal Artillery Band.

5000|$|... 19th century {{variants}} {{based on}} the standard <b>bugle</b> included both <b>keyed</b> and valved <b>bugles.</b> Keyed bugles were invented in England in the early 19th century, with a patent for one design, the Royal Kent bugle, taken out by Joseph Halliday in 1811. This bugle was highly popular and widely in use until c. 1850 - for example, in works by Richard Willis, later bandmaster of the United States Military Academy Band at West Point. This variant of the bugle fell out of use with {{the invention of the}} valved cornet.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{is noted}} for {{beginning}} with Recall, an old bugle call, {{in two different}} keys. These are the <b>keys</b> of the <b>bugles</b> in use by the US Army during World War I, the M1894 Field Trumpet in B-flat (aka, the [...] "Trench Bugle") and the M1896 Field Trumpet in G, which is the [...] "bugle" [...] still in use today. This is a nod to Texas A&M's past as a military school. Indeed, for many years, the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band's halftime show has begun with the drum major shouting [...] "Recall!

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 72 : 03 in length. This choice of program {{was made with}} two things in mind [...] to show {{the use of the}} trumpet in a variety of style periods and in a diversity of ensemble groups. Ronald Lo Presti's work, Suite for Five Trumpets (1960) serves well as a fanfare-like opening. Lo Presti is from the American school although this piece can hardly be considered ???avant garde. ??? The harmony is traditional, each dissonance resolving properly. All five trumpets generally play together in an homophonic texture with only a few spots of imitation. The second movement employs the trumpet in a lyrical style and the final movement again has a fanfare quality but this time with groups of trumpets pairing off in an antiphonal effect. Concerto in E-flat by J. B. G. Neruda was written in the era bridging the baroque and classic periods. It displays mainly classical characteristics [...] the harmony is bland compared to the baroque style (all three movements are in the same key), and there is no imitation or fugal development. This work also uses some of the affectations of the ???stile gallant. ??? This work like the famous Haydn Concerto, was written for the then newly developed <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle</b> which no longer was limited to the natural harmonic series but could be played chromatically. The school of the Paris Conservatory has produced some of the most brilliant music written for the trumpet. This is evident in the Concerto (1949) by Henri Tomasi which shows an influence by the American George Gershwin and also that of jazz, not to mention impressionistic passages reminiscent of Debussy. Tomasi has made use of the straight and cup mutes to effect color changes in the different sections. This Concerto was not conceived as a strict rhythmic exercise. Throughout it are instructions for the performer to take expressive liberty. The Concerto by Alexander Arutunian, although written in 1950, combines a romantic quality with that of Armenian folksong. The scales are modal and phrases irregular. The work opens with a long fanfare section which then moves to a lively dance section contrasted by a lyrical melody. The latter two weave in and out continuously {{throughout the rest of the}} piece. A long cadenza written by the Russian trumpeter Timofy Dokshitzer closes the work. The Quintet (1961) by Malcolm Arnold is written for two trumpets, horn, trombone and tuba. Each instrument is given its moment to shine and Arnold has left out no technical or ensemble difficulties...|$|R
5000|$|The ophicleide, {{like the}} <b>keyed</b> <b>bugle</b> (the soprano member of its 'family') has a {{fingering}} system {{like no other}} wind instrument. All keys except one are normally closed, opening only when a finger presses the associated key lever. Just below the bell is {{the largest of the}} key-covered tone holes, which is normally open, closing only when the lever is pressed. This normally open tone hole is the acoustic bell, with the bell itself having little effect on sound or pitch. The sound produced with no key levers pressed is the nominal pitch of the instrument. If the player presses the lever for this normally open tone hole, that hole is closed and the now-longer air column extends past this hole up to the bell, lowering the pitch by one half step. In general, the player can obtain all the [...] "partial" [...] pitches available for a given air column length. To play a higher series of partials, he opens one of the normally closed tone holes, effectively making that hole the [...] "bell" [...] of the instrument, with a corresponding shorter air column and higher series of pitches. The left hand controls three such tone holes plus the normally open one below the bell. Pitches in the upper and middle range of the instrument can be obtained by using only the left hand's set of tone holes, and the right hand can hold and stabilize the instrument. At the point where the air column is shortened by opening all of the left hand tone holes, there comes a difficult couple of notes that can best be played by continuing to shorten the air column with two fingers of the right hand, before the series of partials [...] "wraps" [...] and the left hand is used again for another set of notes. In the lowest octave, some pitches cannot be obtained very well using the holes closer to the bell. For these notes, the other fingers of the right hand can open a few more tone holes that are relatively closer to the mouthpiece than to the bell. Some instruments were made with between one and three extra right hand keys to provide better intonation for specific notes in this register. The right hand keys may also be used in the upper registers as alternate fingerings to facilitate faster passages or to improve intonation. With the exception of these special few pitches in the low octave, the combinations of partials on various sets of opened tone holes results in the left hand fingers going through something very similar to what they would be doing to manipulate the valves on a modern brass instrument.|$|R
