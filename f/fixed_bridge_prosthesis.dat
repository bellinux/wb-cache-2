The whole material consisted of the patients treated with fixed metal ceramic prostheses by undergraduate students at the Institute of Dentistry during the years 1984 - 1996. There were altogether 772 patients, 460 women (60 %) and 312 men (40 %). Their mean age was 47 years (23 - 81 years). Altogether 944 single metal ceramic crowns and 543 <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> (1374 abutments and 807 pontics) were prepared. It can be concluded that the <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> are most often prepared to replace upper first premolars and lower first molars also in the future. The most usual primary complications related to <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> occurred during preprosthetic endodontic treatment of abutment teeth and during the preparation of the root canals. Previous restoration of the prepared tooth does not have any marked effect on the prognosis of single crowns with dowels, although anatomically complicated upper lateral incisors and upper first premolars need special attention in the treatment planning. Patients were satisfied with aesthetics and function of the fixed metal ceramic prostheses. Late complications found in clinical examinations were few, and the survival rate for the <b>fixed</b> metal ceramic <b>bridge</b> <b>prostheses</b> was calculated to be 84 % after 10 years, long <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> having a lower survival than the shorter ones. The treatment need for conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> seems to be highest among patients over 50 years of age in the future. Age does not influence the longevity of the fixed prostheses, but basic circumstances of the mouth, especially low secretion of saliva affected by diseases and/or medications and high scores of lactobacilli and streptococcus mutans of the saliva seem to decrease the survival...|$|R
40|$|Conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>prostheses</b> {{may fail}} due {{to one or}} more loose retainers, which may be {{difficult}} to diagnose. An objective and reproducible investigation to identify, at an early stage, loosening of a retainer could be of significant benefit. The aims of the current series of investigations were to record retrospectively the clinical performance of different types of conventional fixed prostheses used to replace missing teeth and to determine whether Resonance Frequency Analysis (RFA) was capable of measuring bridge stability, in-vitro. One hundred and twenty two patients with 168 bridges were referred to two consultants at the Department of Restorative Dentistry at Liverpool Dental Hospital between Jan 2004 - Dec 2008 with fixed prosthesis problems. Fixed-fixed designs were the most common (77. 9 %), with cantilever bridges constituting 19. 0 % of the total. The most frequent cause of failure (39. 0 %) was associated with a post and core abutment. Apical pathology was found in 20. 2 %, dental caries in 14. 8 % and loss of retention in 11. 9 %. Fixed-fixed bridges were therefore chosen for further study. In-vitro pilot studies were subsequently undertaken to determine the feasibility of using resonance frequency analysis (RFA) on all-metal fixed-fixed bridges affixed to different models (wholly dental stone, or incorporating a simulated periodontal ligament) and to determine a reliable method to record this using an Osstell Mentor apparatus. The use of a buccal approach to record RF A values was validated. Based on the results from the pilot studies and a subsequent power analysis to set sample size, 100 models with standardised acrylic tooth abutment analogues and simulated periodontal ligaments were fabricated. All-metal fixed-fixed bridges were constructed from the first molar to the first premolar using standardised methods on models based with dental stone to mimic 100 % (n=SO) or SO% (n=SO) bone support. In each case, two equal groups of 2 S specimens had either both retainers cemented, (control group) or the premolar left uncemented (test group) to mimic clinical failure, cemented by a second operator to allow blind analysis. A magnetic component (Smartpeg) was subsequently cemented to the bridge using low-shrink composite resin and the Osstell Mentor used to measure bridge stability expressed as Bridge Stability Quotients (BSQ). The BSQ recorded at the premolar site in both 100 % and SO% bone support models demonstrated a highly statistical significant difference (p 60 suggesting that the <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge</b> was stable (cemented to both abutments) whereas a BSQ > 59 indicated a risk of the bridge being uncemented to the premolar. All 100 % bone support models were subsequently tested to failure in tension using a Universal Testing Machine with a SOO (N) load cell and cross-head speed of 10 mm/min. 37 % of specimens from the control group debonded at loads between 82 to 120 N with the other 63 % failing through extraction of the analogue/fracture of the model. 89. 2 % of the test group specimens failed by extraction of the tooth analogue from one or both ends at loads below SON. Statistical analysis using Kruskal Wallis tests demonstrated that the destructive testing could detect a highly statistically significant difference between the test and control group (P< 0. 0001) These investigations identified mechanical and biological factors associated with failure of conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> and demonstrated that resonance frequency analysis measurements was able to identify, reliably and non-destructively, stable bridges and those with one retainer uncemented, in-vitro. With further developments of the technique {{it may be possible to}} identify fixed-fixed bridge failure clinically and provide appropriate early clinical intervention.

40|$|PURPOSE. The {{purpose of}} this study was to to analyze the effect of Type 2 {{diabetes}} on tooth mortality, implant treatment and prosthetic status. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 275 Type 2 diabetics and 300 non-diabetics, aged 40 - 80 years were selected for analysis. The assessment of number of teeth, missing teeth, <b>fixed</b> <b>prostheses</b> (<b>bridge</b> pontics), implants using panoramic radiographs and dental records were carried out. RESULTS. Diabetes mellitus (DM) patients had a higher number of missing teeth (P<. 05) and placed implants (P=. 074), age (P<. 05), male gender percentage (P=. 042), smoker percentage (P<. 05) than non-DM patients. In univariate analysis, the patients in older group showed significantly higher number of tooth loss rate at the first dental examination than the patients in younger group. Tooth loss rate of smokers did not show higher value than that of non-smokers. When multiple variables including DM, age, smoking, gender were considered together, diabetics and older group patients showed significantly higher tooth loss rate at the first dental examination than non-diabetics and younger group patients, respectively. Smokers and male group did not show a significant difference than non-smokers and female group, respectively. CONCLUSION. Tooth mortality and implant treatment rate were significantly higher in the DM group as indicated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Old age groups showed significantly higher odds ratios and tooth loss rate. As diabetics showed the higher tooth los...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{dentistry}} gives {{possibility to}} rebuild damaged or removed teeth, to correct some patalogical and aesthetical defects and etc. Some procedures request intermediate operations. The usage of temporary <b>bridges</b> <b>prostheses</b> and protective crowns {{are the best}} example of these operations. The products are used for a limited time, but must rise above the crowd in following properties: strength, wear resistance, low absorption of liquids and calorific materials and etc. The main goal of this work is to investigate the maintenance properties of temporary bridges, made of the materials of different manufacturers, by estimating their resistance to the effecting powers within the time of chewing, wear resistance and liquid absorption. The following materials meant for the production of protective crowns were used: GC Unifast LC, STOMA Acryloxide, VOCO Structur 2 SC, 3 M Protemp 3 Garant. The first and the second materials are based on acryloxide, and the other ones are based on composite resin.

40|$|A {{composite}} {{model of}} the mandible, constituted by an inner polymeric core and a glass fibre reinforced outer shell, has been developed and equipped with six ITI titanium implants and a full gold alloy arch <b>bridge</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> The effects of this oral rehabilitation on the biomechanics of the mandible are investigated through a simulation of the lateral component of the pterygoid muscles. These muscles are involved as the mouth is opened and closed, hence their activity is very frequent. An increase of the mandible stiffness due to the prosthesis is observed; moreover, the coupling of the relatively stiff rehabilitation devices with the natural tissue analogue leads to stress-shielding and stress-concentration in the incisal and molar regions, respectively. Although the amplitude of the force generated by pterygoid muscles is quite small, high strains over the incisal region are measured. A stress-shielding effect, of about 20 %, is observed at the symphysis as the full arch <b>bridge</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is <b>fixed</b> on the implants. Therefore, {{the presence of the}} prosthesis leads to significant modification of the stress field experienced by the mandible, and this may be relevant in relation to the biomechanics of mandibular bone remodelling...|$|R
50|$|Most {{electric}} fretted string instruments have individually adjustable bridge saddles, adjustable with a {{screw driver}} or Allen wrench. Acoustic fretted instruments typically have either a floating bridge, {{held in place}} by string tension, or a <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge,</b> such as a pin bridge on an acoustic guitar. A luthier or technician adjusts a floating bridge simply by carefully changing its position until the intonation is correct. Adjusting intonation on a <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge</b> involves carefully shaping the bridge saddle with a file to alter the string's contact point.|$|R
