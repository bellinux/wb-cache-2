50|$|<b>Handsaws</b> {{have been}} around for {{thousands}} of years. Egyptian hieroglyphics exist depicting ancient woodworkers sawing boards into pieces. Ancient bow saws have been found in Japan. The cut patterns on ancient boards may be observed sometimes to bear the unique cutting marks left by saw blades, particularly if the wood was not 'smoothed up' by some method. As for preservation of <b>handsaws,</b> twenty-four saws from eighteenth-century England are known to survive.|$|E
50|$|These include: tape measures, sockets, ratchets, wrenches, squeeze tools (pliers, visegrips), screwdrivers, hammers, prybars, axes, <b>handsaws,</b> chisels, staple guns, hand sanders, gear wrenches, levels, chalk line, etc.|$|E
50|$|Saws {{can also}} be {{considered}} 'pull cut' or 'push cut'. Ancient Egyptian saws have been said to be pull cut. Modern European saws (and those in European-derived cultures like that of the United States) generally have 'push cut' <b>handsaws.</b> Japanese <b>handsaws</b> are usually pull-cut and are still used today. In the 1930s, the Kulibert-Stanley Tool Company popularized an inexpensive saw. Many woodworkers have various theories about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} pull vs. push, and even experts will disagree on these matters, including accuracy of cut, power available for cut, straightness of line, thinness of kerf (the slit in the wood that is made during cutting), etc.|$|E

50|$|Disston Saw Works of Philadelphia {{was one of}} {{the better}} known and highly {{regarded}} manufacturers of <b>handsaws</b> in the United States. During the Machine Age, as Henry Disston & Sons, Inc., it was a supplier of industrial saw blades. A successor corporation, still active in Philadelphia, is called Disston Precision.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company made}} <b>handsaws</b> from the {{beginning}} (1760); in 1833 Henry Disston, a toolmaker, emigrated to the United States and in 1840 started manufacturing saws. The Disston [...] "skew-back" [...] saw was introduced in 1874 and Spear and Jackson also introduced a skew-back design in the late 19th century, with one example being their 1887 Jubilee Saw.|$|E
50|$|The {{story of}} <b>handsaws</b> in the United States mirrors the {{technical}} and political development of steel. Sheffield, England, {{was the center of}} handsaw production during the 18th century and through most of the 19th century because of its fine steel and skilled craftsmen. But England's political and economic lock on steel making in the colonies held American sawmakers at bay until well after the Revolutionary War. American steel producers could not compete until import tariffs leveled the playing field in 1861.|$|E

40|$|Tangible User Interfaces are well-suited to {{handling}} threedimensional {{data sets}} by direct manipulation of real objects in space, but current interfaces {{can make it}} difficult to look inside dense volumes of information. This paper presents the <b>Handsaw,</b> a system that detects a virtual cut-plane projected by an outstretched hand or laser-line directly on an object or space and reveals sectional data on an adjacent display. By leaving the hands free and using a remote display, these techniques can be shared between multiple users and integrated into everyday practice. The <b>Handsaw</b> has been prototyped for scientific visualizations in medicine, engineering and urban design. User evaluations suggest that using a hand is more intuitive while projected light is more precise than keyboard and mouse control, and the <b>Handsaw</b> system {{has the potential to be}} used effectively by novices and in groups...|$|R
50|$|In 1872, {{industrialist}} Henry Disston, seeing, {{among other}} things, {{easy access to}} river and railroad, purchased 390 acre in Tacony and moved his growing saw and file manufactory there from cramped quarters in Kensington. (Henry's brother had earlier purchased vacation property from the Cottage Association.) The company became the largest {{of its kind in}} the world for a century, employing up to 5,000 workers at one time. A Time magazine article claimed in 1940 that 75 percent of the <b>handsaws</b> sold in the U.S. were made by Disston.|$|E
50|$|Museum {{exhibits}} highlight economic, technological, {{social, and}} cultural contributions made {{throughout the region}} by loggers and the logging industry. Interior displays include working models of sawmills and logging camps, historic logging photos, dioramas illustrating the evolution of logging from the 1850s to the present day, and a large collection of logging tools such as <b>handsaws,</b> drag saws and chainsaws, peeves and canthooks, broadaxes and felling axes. Also, a full-size scene of a 1930s-era logging camp family cabin, and touch-screen displays of logging sights and sounds are highlights of the museum.|$|E
50|$|To {{prevent the}} body of the blade binding and for other {{enhancements}} to the cutting action, the teeth can be set (angled out) from the blade. Teeth can be set in several patterns: single-sided set, alternating set or a patterned set. Most Western and Asian <b>handsaws</b> use an alternating set, whereby a tooth is set the opposite direction from the preceding one. Specialized tools like veneer saws or flush-cut saws may be set only to one side. Some hacksaws and machine saw blades have patterned sets that may require specially designed saw sets to create.|$|E

30|$|To {{clarify the}} {{inducing}} mechanism of kerf deviation caused by unsymmetrical {{set of the}} <b>handsaw,</b> we hypothesized that the moment on the bottom edge of the saw blade, which is generated by the unsymmetrical set on <b>handsaw</b> teeth, bends the saw blade and this deformation should be one factor of the kerf deviation. To verify this hypothesis, the bend of a saw blade was examined by experiment and by calculation. In the experiments, a model tooth was attached to an actual <b>handsaw.</b> In the calculations, a saw model with a rectangular prism as the model tooth was analyzed by the finite element method. Loads were applied on the model tooth or the rectangular prism. From both the experiments and the calculations, the following results were obtained: (1) the deformation of the <b>handsaw</b> {{was caused by the}} unsymmetrical set in the length direction and the height direction of the saw blade; (2) the deformation and the inclination of the blade was larger at the front part of the saw than at the butt part; and (3) comparing the saw handle fixing conditions, the kerf deviation in the sawing line was supposed to be larger in the free handle condition and that kerf deviation in the depth direction was larger in the fixed handle condition. Based on the above results, it is apparent that one of the kerf deviation mechanisms originated from unsymmetrical set on the saw teeth.|$|R

50|$|But the company's {{innovation}} and industriousness would not last forever. In 1955, with mounting cash-flow problems and waning {{interest on the}} family's part to run the firm, Henry Disston and Sons was sold to the H.K. Porter Company of Pittsburgh. Porter's Disston Division was sold in 1978 and became the Henry Disston Division of Sandvik Saw of Sweden. This division was then sold in 1984 to R.A.F. Industries of Philadelphia and became known as Disston Precision Incorporated, maker of specialized flat steel products. Although the company has ceased making Disston <b>handsaws,</b> the Disston brand name still exists in this firm.|$|E
50|$|In 1862 Swedish Göran Fredrik Göransson founded Högbo Stål & Jernwerks AB, {{producing}} {{high quality}} steel using the Bessemer process. In 1866 company went into bankruptcy and was refunded as Sandviken Jernverks AB in 1868. With the new technology {{a number of new}} applications for steel wires were discovered, for instance it was perfect for producing fishing hooks. A fishing hook must be hard and strong but absolutely not brittle. In 1879 The Swedish national board of trade approved the use of the Fish and Hook trademark. Starting in 1886, Göran began the production of saw blades that were of that same {{high quality steel}}. The little fish surrounded by a hook that was registered as the official emblem of rolled steel for fishhooks was also used for the <b>handsaws,</b> to communicate these special properties and quality of the blades. Today all Bahco tools are branded with this logo.|$|E
50|$|The {{extent of}} the Hawley Collection was matched by {{the extent of his}} {{knowledge}} regarding it. It comprises over 70,000 tools, mostly but not entirely from Sheffield, as well as catalogues and other documents. The tools include many examples of such things as planes, table knives, anvils, files, taps and dies, rules, micrometers, scissors, hammers, <b>handsaws,</b> and vernier and caliper gauges. He stored these in two garden sheds, then in his garage. The garage was eventually turned into a two-storey building to provide more space, and he also used his attic as well as space begged from other people.Hawley spread his knowledge among a team of volunteers who both assisted in cataloguing the collection and in some cases became experts in their own right. He also co-authored books on various aspects of the Sheffield steel industries and took part in many interviews that have since been transcribed.|$|E

40|$|Initially a {{study was}} {{conducted}} using a single ripsaw tooth to cut a variety of woods both along and across the grain. A CNC router machine was used to control the tool path and apply cutting depths of between 0. 4 - 1. 2 mm. A series of mechanical tests were conducted concurrently, evaluating the same wood varieties in bending (across the grain) and shear (along the grain). A second study evaluated two different tooth geometries: a bevelled <b>handsaw</b> tooth and an unbevelled <b>handsaw</b> tooth. In this instance only one wood variety was machined (Douglas fir) both along and across the grain. To ensure a lower cutting depth (≈ 0. 15 mm) a shaper machine was used to control the tool path. A high speed camera with macroscopic lens was used to capture the chip formation in real time. For the first study, a triaxial dynamometer was used to record the forces acting on the ripsaw tooth. Modulus of rupture (Pa) and bending toughness (J/m 3) {{were found to have}} the greatest influence on cutting forces across the grain. Likewise, shear strength (Pa) and shear toughness (J/m 3) were found to have the greatest influence on cutting forces along the grain. From the second study, the high speed footage of the unbevelled <b>handsaw</b> tooth showed this to be the most effective at removing material along the grain in a “chisel like” cutting action. The high speed footage of the bevelled <b>handsaw</b> tooth showed that the sharp lateral edges of these teeth are ideal for severing the wood fibres across the grain in a “knife like” cutting action...|$|R
50|$|Tree care is the {{application}} of arboricultural methods like pruning, trimming, and felling/thinning in built environments. Road verge, greenways, backyard and park woody vegetation {{are at the center}} of attention for the tree care industry. Landscape architecture and urban forestry also set high demands on professional tree care. High safety standards against the dangers of tree care have helped the industry evolve. Especially felling in space-limited environments poses significant risks: the vicinity of power or telephone lines, insufficient protective gear (against falling dead wood, chainsaw wounds, etc.) and narrow felling zones with endangered nearby buildings, parking cars, etc.. The required equipment and experience usually transcends private means and is often considered too costly as a permanent part of the public infrastructure. In singular cases, traditional tools like <b>handsaws</b> may suffice, but large-scale tree care usually calls for heavy machinery like cranes, bucket trucks,harvesters, and woodchippers.|$|E
50|$|Volunteer crews began {{construction}} on the new summer camp in spring of 1959 in a race to finish before the scheduled opening on June 28, 1959. The first major building of the camp was established with the pouring of {{the foundation for the}} dining hall. Parishes from various parts of Southern Illinois provided funds and volunteer builders. Volunteer tradesmen gave their time on weekends to provide plumbing and carpentry skills. Older high school boys and seminarians volunteered their time during the week. They spent days building cabins with <b>handsaws</b> and evenings in a farmhouse near the camp location. As the first week of June approached, none of the units were complete yet. A week before opening day a bathhouse was built, although it lacked a water heater, and a well was dug to provide fresh water. As children and parents arrived on opening day, volunteers scrambled to finish building the last of the bunks in the cabins.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Lizarraga {{worked in}} several areas to promote women's rights. In 1953, she {{was hired as a}} female parole officer for the Social Development Department. In 1954, she began {{organizing}} women politically throughout the country beginning in her home area of Maskall Village. From there she traveled north to Orange Walk Town, and then to Sand Hill, Benque Viejo and finally to the far southern, Punta Gorda. In 1959, she formed the United Women’s Group (UWG) with 900 women from throughout the country, with the goals of empowering women culturally, economically, and politically. To that end, she co-founded the United Women’s Credit Union, encouraging women save, [...] "even if they could only afford $0.25 per week". Recognizing that only landowners were eligible voters in British Honduras at that time, Madam Liz made special efforts to help women acquire property. She took women from the UWG to the Lands Department to obtain land grants, but they were was told there was no land available. Marching into the swamps, Lizarraga surveyed and created a map of parcels for the women. She then took it back to the Lands Department for recording. These women's parcels are located in what is today the Collet Constituency between Curassow, Elston Kerr and Gibnut Streets, bounded by North Creek. Similarly when children were denied access to education because there was no money to prepare the site and construct a school in their poor and working-class neighborhood, Madam Liz and the UWG women began clearing the mangroves from the swamps with two-man <b>handsaws.</b> Workers from the Publics Works Department later joined the women and the result was two new schools—Belize Junior Secondary Schools N° 1 and N° 2—were completed, which were later renamed Edward P. Yorke School and Gwen Lizarraga High School.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{whether the}} same factors {{underlie}} comfort in using {{different kinds of}} hand tools (screwdrivers, paintbrushes and <b>handsaws).</b> The underlying factors of the hand tools are identified using principal components analysis. The relationships between comfort descriptors (i. e. statements in end-users' own words {{that are related to}} comfort) and comfort factors (i. e. groups of comfort descriptors) with comfort experience are calculated. It is concluded that the same factors (functionality, physical interaction adverse effects on skin and in soft tissues) underlie comfort in different kinds of hand tools, however their relative importance differed. Functionality and physical interaction are the most important factors of comfort in using screwdrivers and paintbrushes (beta 0. 73 and 0. 67, respectively) and functionality was {{the most important factor in}} using <b>handsaws</b> (beta 0. 72). Moreover, the most important comfort descriptors differ between different kinds of hand tools. 'Has a nice feeling handle' (beta 0. 27), 'fits the hand' (beta 0. 43) and 'offers a high task performance' (beta 0. 43) are the most important comfort descriptors in using screwdrivers, paintbrushes and <b>handsaws,</b> respectively. Moreover, similarities are seen: 'Fits the hand' is associated with comfort in all studied hand tools. The results are applied in a flow chart, which designers can use to address the appropriate comfort descriptors in the hand tool design process. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
