40|$|Several recent general {{circulation}} model studies discuss the predictability of the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> dipole (IOD) mode, {{suggesting that it}} is predictable because of coupled ocean–atmosphere interactions in the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> However, {{it is not clear}} from these studies how much of the predictability is due to the response to El Niño. It is shown in this note that a simple statistical model that treats the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> as a red noise process forced by tropical Pacific SST shows forecast skills comparable to those of recent {{general circulation}} model studies. The results also indicate that some of the eastern tropical <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> SST predictability in recent studies may indeed be beyond the skill of the simple model proposed in this note, indicating that dynamics in the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> may have caused this improved predictability in this region.

40|$|Anomalous east-west {{asymmetric}} anomalies {{were seen}} in sea surface temperature (SST), and convective activity over the equatorial <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> during October-December 1997. Using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and sea surface height data obtained from TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite altimeter, its triggering process and strengthening mechanism are identified. The climatological wind over the equatorial <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> exhibits different seasonal cycle between its western and eastern region. During the summer monsoon season, westerly wind prevails over the western <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> on the other hand, easterly wind is dominant over the eastern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> at almost the same time. During the 1997 summer, divergent easterly wind anomalies were obvious over the equatorial <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> due to a warm episode of the El Nino, which weakened (accelerated) the climatological westerly (easterly) wind over the western (eastern) <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> As a result, the east-west SST contrast was produced in the succeeding autumn through changing evaporative cooling and upwelling. Corresponding to these SST changes, the convective activities were enhanced (suppressed) over the western (eastern) <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> and actual wind became easterly in place of climatological westerly wind during October-December 1997...|$|R

30|$|There {{have been}} {{observations}} of persistent subsurface cooling in the subtropical southern <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> {{which have been}} attributed to both local <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> wind forcing and remote Pacific influences (Han et al. 2014).

The second is a scaled-down version of the first into the East <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> The third and largest in area is an Indo-Pacific concept which emphasises the pre-eminence of regional naval power and ensures that India (along with Indonesia, Japan and the United States, among others) potentially plays a central policing role not only within the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Region...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} feature of the Indonesian Throughflow is that because {{the water in the}} western equatorial Pacific Ocean has a higher temperature and lower salinity than the water in the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> the Throughflow transports large amounts of relatively warm and fresh water to the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean.</b> When the Indonesian Throughflow (through Lombok Strait, Ombai and the Timor Passages) enters the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> it is advected towards Africa within the Indian South Equatorial Current. There it eventually exits the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> with the Agulhas Current around South Africa into the Atlantic Ocean. So the Indonesian Throughflow transports a significant amount of Pacific Ocean heat into the southwest <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean,</b> which is approximately 10000 km away from the Lombok Strait.|$|R

40|$|International audienceEl Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{consists}} of irregular episodes of warm El Niño and cold La Niña {{conditions in the}} tropical Pacific Ocean(1), with significant global socio-economic and environmental impacts(1). Nevertheless, forecasting ENSO at lead times longer than a few months remains a challenge(2, 3). Like the Pacific <b>Ocean,</b> the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> also shows interannual climate fluctuations, which are known as the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Dipole(4, 5). Positive phases of the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Dipole tend to co-occur with El Niño, and negative phases with La Niña(6 - 9).

Observations and model analyses suggest that the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Dipole modulates the strength of the Walker circulation in autumn. The quick demise of the <b>Indian</b> <b>Ocean</b> Dipole anomaly in November-December then induces a sudden collapse of anomalous zonal winds over the Pacific Ocean, which leads to the development of El Niño/La Niña.
