But, in the sculptural portrayal, they are depicted quite differently as protectors and benevolent mothers. They are armed with the same weapons, wear the same ornaments, and ride the same vahanas and carry the same banners as their corresponding male deities.|$|E

In some cultures, hyenas are thought to influence people’s spirits, rob graves, and steal livestock and children. Other cultures associate them with witchcraft, using their body parts in traditional African medicine.|$|E
25|$|With {{popularity}} came {{controversy over}} the show's suitability for children. Morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse repeatedly complained to the BBC in the 1970s over what she saw as the show's <b>frightening</b> <b>and</b> gory content. John Nathan-Turner produced the series during the 1980s and was heard {{to say that he}} looked forward to Whitehouse's comments, as the show's ratings would increase soon after she had made them.|$|E
25|$|The most shocking, <b>frightening,</b> <b>and</b> {{fascinating}} {{image in}} {{rock in the}} last few years is Courtney Love's stage dive... When some male performers do it, it looks like muscular, frat-boy fun, controlled aggression... For obvious reasons, the practice was strictly no-girls-allowed, but Love, typically, decided that she wanted to do it, too. Groped, ravaged, she compared the experience to being raped, wrote a song about it, and now does it just about every show.|$|E

25|$|Convulsive {{therapy was}} {{introduced}} in 1934 by Hungarian neuropsychiatrist Ladislas J. Meduna who, believing mistakenly that schizophrenia and epilepsy were antagonistic disorders, induced seizures first with camphor and then metrazol (cardiazol). Meduna {{is thought to be}} the father of convulsive therapy. In 1937, the first international meeting on convulsive therapy was held in Switzerland by the Swiss psychiatrist Muller. The proceedings were published in the American Journal of Psychiatry and, within three years, cardiazol convulsive therapy was being used worldwide. Italian Professor of neuropsychiatry Ugo Cerletti, who had been using electric shocks to produce seizures in animal experiments, and his colleague Lucio Bini developed the idea of using electricity as a substitute for metrazol in convulsive therapy and, in 1938, experimented {{for the first time on}} a person. It was believed early on that inducing convulsions aided in helping those with severe schizophrenia but later found to be most useful with affective disorders such as depression. Cerletti had noted a shock to the head produced convulsions in dogs. The idea to use electroshock on humans came to Cerletti when he saw how pigs were given an electric shock before being butchered to put them in an anesthetized state. Cerletti and Bini practiced until they felt they had the right parameters needed to have a successful human trial. Once they started trials on patients, they found that after 10-20 treatments the results were significant. Patients had much improved. A positive side effect to the treatment was retrograde amnesia. It was because of this side effect that patients could not remember the treatments and had no ill feelings toward it. ECT soon replaced metrazol therapy all over the world because it was cheaper, less <b>frightening</b> <b>and</b> more convenient. Cerletti and Bini were nominated for a Nobel Prize but did not receive one. By 1940, the procedure was introduced to both England and the US. In Germany and Austria, it was promoted by Friedrich Meggendorfer. Through the 1940s and 1950s, the use of ECT became widespread.|$|E
500|$|BioShock {{contains}} both {{licensed music}} and an original score. The licensed {{music from the}} 1940s and 1950s can be heard playing on phonograph throughout Rapture. In total, 30 licensed songs can be heard throughout the game. The original score was composed by Garry Schyman. He works his pieces to mesh well with the chosen licensed music as to keep the same feel, while also trying to bring out something that was [...] "eerie, <b>frightening</b> <b>and</b> at times beautiful" [...] to mesh well with Rapture's environments.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rappler.com, Gabriela Lee {{praised the}} writing as [...] "fast-paced and efficient." [...] She {{especially}} highlighted {{the scene in}} which Nico reveals himself to be gay, commenting: [...] "there was nothing soft or comforting about their confrontation. Love was shown as something violent and <b>frightening,</b> <b>and</b> Nico's internal conflict unfolded {{without a hint of}} irony or disrespect." [...] Lee was also surprised by the role given to Bob and confessed to having cried at the end given to the character. To close her analysis, she said: [...] "The best lesson that one can take away from reading this book: that even the most terrible person can have a change of heart and make their own choices to do what is right." ...|$|E

500|$|Jones, {{who played}} Les, {{revealed}} that the runaway storyline was tough on him and he began crying when he read the script. He continued [...] "The four {{of us in the}} Battersby family read our scripts together to work out how we are going to play our parts. On this occasion, all four of us were sobbing. It is not like a normal Coronation Street story, it's more like a Taggart or a Cracker." [...] Jones thought the [...] "scrapes" [...] that Toyah found herself in were <b>frightening</b> <b>and</b> hoped that if the storyline could stop one teenager from running away from home, then it would be worthwhile. The storyline attracted the attention of the Independent Television Commission, who believed that the episode featuring Toyah's abduction should have carried a warning before it was broadcast.|$|E
500|$|When Philip of Hesse's {{law on the}} {{protection}} of the Jews in his territory expired in 1538, he commissioned Bucer to create a new policy. Philip gave him a draft that was tolerant in the regulation of their affairs. Bucer rejected the favourable conditions and recommended that Jews be prohibited from all trades except those providing minimum subsistence. [...] His Judenratschlag also included his first use of negative stereotypes of the Jews. Philip's ordinance of 1539 represented a compromise. He allowed the Jews to engage in trade and commerce but included strict rules on their association with Christians. The potential for an arbitrary enforcement of the new policy was <b>frightening,</b> <b>and</b> as a result many Jews chose to leave Hesse. For this Bucer must share part of the blame.|$|E
500|$|Live Through This was a {{commercial}} and critical success, hitting platinum RIAA certification in April 1995 and receiving numerous critical accolades. The {{success of the}} record combined with Cobain's suicide resulted in {{a high level of}} publicity for Love, and she was featured on Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People in 1995. At Hole's performance on August 26, 1994 at the Reading Festival— Love's first public performance following her husband's death— she appeared onstage with outstretched arms, mimicking crucifixion. A MTV review of their performance referred to it as [...] "by turns macabre, <b>frightening</b> <b>and</b> inspirational." [...] John Peel wrote in The Guardian that Love's disheveled appearance [...] "would have drawn whistles of astonishment in Bedlam", and that her performance [...] "verged on the heroic... Love steered her band through a set which dared you to pity either her recent history or that of the band... the band teetered on the edge of chaos, generating a tension which I cannot remember having felt before from any stage." ...|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers criticised {{the first}} third of Tunnels for its slow pace, but praised the {{remainder}} of the book for its fast-paced excitement, suspense, and adventure. In Britain, children's author Philip Ardagh, reviewing for The Guardian, thought the long wait for Will to discover the underground city could dull the reader's anticipation, noting that the event did not occur until page 170. He did observe, however, that when the city is reached, [...] "fantastic fun" [...] begins and that from then on its well paced, exciting and – in places – <b>frightening</b> <b>and</b> bloody." [...] He thought the characters [...] "splendidly named and drawn". In The Sunday Times of 7 July 2007, Nicolette Jones described the book as [...] "a good adventure yarn ... ut after 460 suspenseful pages it is frustratingly inconclusive." [...] She noted the book became a best-seller the month of its release based simply on [...] "stories about its discovery by [...] Barry Cunningham, who [...] "found" [...] Harry Potter." ...|$|E
500|$|Shill and cinematographer Ken Seng were {{inspired}} by Roman Polanski and Alfred Hitchcock when constructing the set, and attempted {{to make it look}} both <b>frightening</b> <b>and</b> suburban. Shill stated, [...] "It didn't look like typical Hollywood; it didn't look cosmetic." [...] The Charles' family home was set in a 1923 Altadena, California house, however the action scenes were shot on a separate purpose-built set. The set was customized from a house built for The Stepfather (2009), which in turn was adapted from a block of apartments for Quarantine (2008). The Charles' living room had a ceiling [...] high, and a custom-built chandelier for the climactic ending of the film. According to Gainor, the house is symbolic of the family's aspirations, and is intentionally too large for the three occupants; he said, [...] "It's a little awkward and a little bit eerie." [...] The fight scene was filmed on a sound stage set, rather than in the house, for safety and practicability reasons.|$|E
500|$|The song {{features}} [...] "The Fry Song", co-written by Ward and Sugar. This was {{her first}} song written for the series, and {{would go on to}} become popular with the fanbase of Adventure Time. Sugar's original version was inspired by Broadway theatre and was more sombre. Ward helped Sugar add more jokes to the final version. During the network pitch of the episode, Ward beatboxed and Sugar played ukulele and the two performed [...] "The Fry Song". Sugar later called the experience [...] "super terrifying", although the network did green-light the episode. [...] The episode was the third episode of the season produced, but was chosen to be the first aired. When the network announced the start of season two, the episode was not finished. On his personal website, executive producer Fred Seibert noted that he would [...] "prefer [...] stock up on a few episodes before jumping into season two, but it ain’t my network". Seibert also felt that the episode was rather <b>frightening</b> <b>and</b> warned potential watchers that it might not be suitable for younger children.|$|E

500|$|S {{director}} J. T. Petty {{originally intended}} {{the film to}} focus on a man who lived near his childhood home; the man often spied on, and filmed, his neighbors. The footage led to an indictment towards [...] "the peeper", who recorded 191 videotapes of Petty's childhood neighborhood. The indictment implied the footage should be viewed in court, but the people in the neighborhood opposed this owing to privacy concerns. Petty said of the 191 videotapes, [...] "I admired the peeping tom; he had made movies that were <b>frightening</b> <b>and</b> titillating and real." [...] The idea of using a camera to record his neighbor's house for hours fascinated him so much that he decided to direct a film about it. Although he had already secured funding, Petty was left without a subject since [...] "the peeper" [...] {{wanted nothing to do with}} the film. Petty decided to focus on three directors, who did not direct films aimed at the general public; they directed simulated snuff films, involving murder and sexual assault. Petty found the directors— Zebub, Vogel, and Marcisak, Petty's friend who played the fictional director Rost— at the Chiller Convention, an underground horror event.|$|E
500|$|Another {{factor in}} the {{original}} development of set pieces was the design of vast and seamless environments. They were meant to enable scenarios such as the player character being shot at from a great distance, or a battle which would change scenes between the outside and inside of a building. This corroborated Nomura's intended action-oriented system with more intuitive game controls. He instructed his team to study third-person shooters for reference, [...] "not in simplistic terms, like controls or mechanics, but {{in the way they}} create tension and mood and incorporate the action within that". This carried over into XV, with the stated aim being to distance the game structurally from XIII and its sequels, which featured divided zones rather than a large seamless world. The original inspiration behind this approach was the world design of , with later inspirations being modern Western triple-A open world titles. The environments are divided into three different segments, with separate teams working on each: the world map, locations in the game world, and dungeons. The dungeons were designed to be beautiful, <b>frightening,</b> <b>and</b> memorable. Specific pieces of concept art were created to represent different regions and aesthetic concepts: a single building design was used to capture the essence of Altissia's Venice-inspired atmosphere, while older car designs when compared to the party's vehicle Regalia reflected the lack of human advancement outside Lucis.|$|E
500|$|Bloody Disgusting {{ranked the}} film first in {{their list of}} the 'Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade', with the article saying [...] "It’s rare enough for a horror film to be good; even rarer are those that {{function}} as genuine works of art. Let the Right One In {{is one of those}} films – an austerely beautiful creation that reveals itself slowly, like the best works of art do." [...] The film was ranked #15 in Empires 2010 list of [...] "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema". In their rationale, the authors noted that, [...] "in these days where every second movie seems to feature vampires, it takes a very special twist on the legend to surprise us – but this one knocked us out and then bit us in the jugular", and found that the [...] "strange central friendship" [...] between the two lead characters was what made the film [...] "so <b>frightening,</b> <b>and</b> so magnetic". In the early 2010s, Time Out conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films; Let the Right One In placed at number 28 on their top 100 list. The film was later voted the 94th greatest film since 2000 in an international critics' poll conducted by BBC.|$|E
