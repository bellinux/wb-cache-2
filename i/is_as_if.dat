As a whole, his games {{are not of}} particular fame, although they have some unique elements that set them apart from mainstream games. For instance, the card game Metamorphosis is a complex trick-taking game. As you play the game, the rules change three times, so it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you are playing four different games that are threaded together.|$|E
5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E

25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} if people repent, it is {{accounted}} {{as if they had}} gone up to Jerusalem, built the Temple and the altars, and offered all the sacrifices ordained in the Torah. Rabbi Aha said in the name of Rabbi Hanina ben Pappa that God accounts studying the sacrifices as equivalent to offering them. Rav Huna taught that God said that engaging in the study of Mishnah <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> one were offering up sacrifices. Samuel taught that God said that engaging {{in the study of the}} law <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> one were building the Temple. And the Avot of Rabbi Natan taught that God loves Torah study more than sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on which}} theory of utility is used, the {{interpretation}} of marginal utility can be meaningful or not. Economists have commonly described utility {{as if it were}} quantifiable, that <b>is,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> different levels of utility could be compared along a numerical scale. This has affected the development and reception of theories of marginal utility. Quantitative concepts of utility allow familiar arithmetic operations, and further assumptions of continuity and differentiability greatly increase tractability.|$|E

25|$|Atoms in {{the first}} excited state may also be re-ionized by the ambient CMB photons {{before they reach the}} ground state. When this is the case, it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the {{recombination}} to the excited state did not happen {{in the first}} place. To account for this possibility, Peebles defines the factor C as the probability that an atom in the first excited state reaches the ground state through either of the two pathways described above before being photoionized.|$|E
25|$|Statutes {{and common}} law rules that are {{declared}} unconstitutional are void ab initio (from the beginning) – it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they never existed. This may create {{a problem as}} past cases decided {{on the basis of}} the unconstitutional legislation or precedent may be open to re-litigation. To overcome this problem, the Court of Appeal may apply the doctrine of prospective overruling to preserve the state of law prior to the date when the unconstitutional law is overruled.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s through the 1970s, she {{abandoned}} painting, {{and focused on}} working in graphite pencil, creating highly detailed photorealistic drawings, based on photographs of natural elements such as the ocean's or moon's surface, the insides of shells, and closeups of rocks. Critics frequently compare her laborious approach to contemporaries Chuck Close and Gerhard Richter, and she has cited Giorgio Morandi, {{a master of the}} pale grey still life, as a major influence. These works also share with Richter's an apparent randomness and thus apparently dispassionate attitude. It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> any photograph would do as a source for a painting, and the choice is apparently unimportant. This is of course not the case, but the work contains within it the impression that the image is chosen at random from an endless selection of possible alternative images of similar nature.|$|E

25|$|However, Alexander Grosart {{denies that}} Henry Vaughan was solely an imitator of Herbert. There are moments {{in when the}} reader can {{identify}} Vaughan's true self, rather than an imitation of Herbert. In such passages Vaughan is seen to demonstrate naturalness, immediacy and ability to relate the concrete through poetry. In some instances, Vaughan derives observations from Herbert's language that are distinctly his own. It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Vaughan takes proprietorship of some of Herbert's work, yet makes it completely unique to himself. Vaughan takes another step away from Herbert in his manner of presenting his poetry. Herbert in The Temple, which is most often the source of comparison between the two writers, lays down explicit instructions on its reading. This contrasts with the attitude of Vaughan, who saw the experience of reading as the best guide to his meanings and promoted no special reading method.|$|E
25|$|Leigh Fermor {{translated}} the manuscript The Cretan Runner written by George Psychoundakis, a dispatch runner on Crete during the war, and helped Psychoundakis get his work published. Fermor also wrote a novel, The Violins of Saint-Jacques, which was adapted as an opera by Malcolm Williamson. His friend Lawrence Durrell, in Bitter Lemons (1957), recounts how, during the Cypriot insurgency against continued British rule in 1955, Leigh Fermor visited Durrell's villa in Bellapais, Cyprus: After a splendid dinner {{by the fire}} he starts singing, songs of Crete, Athens, Macedonia. When I go out to refill the ouzo bottle...I find the street completely filled with people listening in utter silence and darkness. Everyone seems struck dumb. 'What is it?' I say, catching sight of Frangos. 'Never have I heard of Englishmen singing Greek songs like this!' Their reverent amazement is touching; it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they want to embrace Paddy wherever he goes.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} of the population was Christian and was to remain so until the conquest of Saladin in 1187. The Muslim conquest apparently had little impact on social and administrative continuities for several decades. The word 'Arab' at the time referred predominantly to Bedouin nomads, though Arab settlement is attested in the Judean highlands and near Jerusalem by the 5th century, and some tribes had converted to Christianity. The local population engaged in farming, which was considered demeaning, and were called Nabaț, referring to Aramaic-speaking villagers. A ḥadīth, brought {{in the name of a}} Muslim freedman who settled in Palestine, ordered the Muslim Arabs not to settle in the villages, [...] "for he who abides in villages it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he abides in graves".|$|E
500|$|A {{focal point}} of Hazlitt's account of Troilus and Cressida is a {{comparison}} of the characterisation in this play and that in Chaucer's poem Troilus and Criseyde (one of Shakespeare's sources). Chaucer's characters are full and well developed; but Chaucer unfolded each character in itself, one at a time. Shakespeare displayed characters as they see themselves as well as how others see them, and showed the effects each has on the others. Shakespeare's characters were so distinctive that it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> each were expressed by a distinct [...] "faculty" [...] of his mind; and, in effect, these faculties could be considered as showing [...] "excessive sociability", notable for [...] "how they gossiped and compared notes together." [...] Twentieth-century critic Arthur Eastman thought that, although these remarks did insufficient justice to Chaucer, they were particularly original in revealing [...] "the sophisticated genius of Shakespeare." ...|$|E

500|$|During his procrastinations with Koussevitzky, Sibelius {{continued}} {{to work on the}} symphony. In 1931 he again spent time in Berlin, writing to Aino in May 1931 that [...] "the symphony is advancing with rapid strides". Progress was interrupted by illness, but {{towards the end of the}} year Sibelius was confidently asserting that [...] "I am writing my eighth symphony and I am full of youth. How can this be explained?" [...] In May 1933, as he {{continued to}} deny Koussevitzky, Sibelius wrote in his diary that he was deeply immersed in composition: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I had come home... I'm taking everything in another way, more deeply. A gypsy within me. Romantic." [...] Later that summer he informed a journalist that his new symphony was nearly complete: [...] "It will be the reckoning of my whole existence – sixty-eight years. It will probably be my last. Eight symphonies and a hundred songs. It has to be enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Film noir {{is often}} {{described}} as essentially pessimistic. The noir stories that are regarded as most characteristic tell of people trapped in unwanted situations (which, in general, they did not cause but are responsible for exacerbating), striving against random, uncaring fate, and frequently doomed. The films are seen as depicting a world that is inherently corrupt. Classic film noir has been associated by many critics with the American social landscape of the era—in particular, with a sense of heightened anxiety and alienation that is said to have followed World War II. In author Nicholas Christopher's opinion, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the war, and the social eruptions in its aftermath, unleashed demons that had been bottled up in the national psyche." [...] Film noirs, especially those of the 1950s and the height of the Red Scare, are often said to reflect cultural paranoia; Kiss Me Deadly is the noir most frequently marshaled as evidence for this claim.|$|E
500|$|Traditionally, reviewers {{have been}} put off by Agârbiceanu's plot devices and epic mannerisms, and in {{particular}} by his explanatory comments and notes, which they deem superfluous and distracting. As Lovinescu notes, Agârbiceanu and other Transylvanian realists will [...] "accumulate in details", but will remain [...] "incapable of narrating {{on more than one}} level": [...] "for all their dynamism, his sketches are not exciting in the dramatic sense." [...] The moralizing aspect of Agârbiceanu's fiction makes it hard to separate between it and his purely theological productions: as Lovinescu notes, whenever Agârbiceanu depicts village drunks, it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> [...] "for an anti-saloon exhibition." [...] Dragomirescu argues that Agârbiceanu's work amounts to a set of humanitarian [...] "directives", although, he concludes, its depiction of [...] "the bleak and mystical recess of life" [...] is a fine literary contribution, [...] "rising above" [...] his generation's. He states: [...] "Agârbiceanu is a socializing Poporanist or Sămănătorist only when he is at his weakest".|$|E
