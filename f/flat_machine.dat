5000|$|Van Der Waals force between like metals is high; {{freehand}} manufacture {{as described}} below in History of square plates produces only square, <b>flat,</b> <b>machine</b> tool components, accurate to millionths of an inch, but of nearly no variety.

As the fit between sliding parts of a made product, machine, or machine tool approaches this critical thousandth of an inch measurement, lubrication and capillary action combine to prevent Van Der Walls force from welding like metals together, extending the lubricated life of sliding parts by a factor of thousands to millions; the disaster of oil depletion in the conventional automotive engine is an accessible demonstration of the need, and in aerospace design, like-to-unlike design is used along with solid lubricants to prevent Van Der Walls welding from destroying mating surfaces.|$|E

40|$|The basic {{physics and}} {{technological}} aspects of {{application of the}} electromagnetic impulses for the obtaining of permanent connections from pipes, for compacting of powders and for shaping of details from metallic and nonmetallic materials are analyzed. The recommendations on choice of parameters of the equipment (pulsed electromagnetic fields generator) and of the tool (magnetic coil) for the annular and <b>flat</b> <b>machining</b> are offered. The optimal working conditions (maximal pressure plus durability) {{for each type of}} magnetic coils are revealed. Thus, the presence of the electromagnetic enhancers promotes the increasing of the impulse pressure on the specified area of the detail and, hence, increases the tool zone. Examples of practical application of the proposed technology for joining of details from heterogeneous materials (copper-aluminum, copper-steel and others) are offered. Compacting of powders using the electromagnetic impulses allows to increase the density and to improve the physical mechanical properties of the powder production. Besides the absence of the mechanical contact in this method open up possibilities to produce the new modifications of the sintered metal powder details...|$|R

40|$|The "safe gap" {{is defined}} as the maximum gap between two close-fitting, <b>flat,</b> <b>machined</b> metal {{surfaces}} that will just prevent an explosion within a vessel from producing a propagating combustion wave in the gases that surround the vessel. At present three distinctly different apparatuses are used throughout the world to determine experimentally the maximum safe gap for different combustible gases and vapors. Unfortunately, the maximum safe gap thus determined sometimes differs widely from vessel to vessel. This report investigates the nature of the processes by which the explosion is transmitted to the surrounding media, paying particular attention to the differences from apparatus to apparatus. It is found that the time constants associated with the combustion process and with vessel exhausting are markedly different for the different vessels and that the pressure levels developed inside a vessel during the test also vary markedly from vessel to vessel. Based on these observations, it is recommended that a more thorough theoretical and experimental investigation of the safe gap testing procedures and vessel design be made as the basis for a proper design for adequate safe gap testing of all combustible vapors and gases...|$|R

The mathematical modeling of the average roughness Ra, of the mean spacing of roughness profile irregularities Sm and of the surface hardness HIT of the treated surfaces was performed by the response surface methodology (RSM). Best ball-burnished surface integrity has been established by the application of optimal ballburnishing studied factors (Vb = 500 mm/min, ab= 40 μm, and f = 0. 2 mm). High surface quality is then characterized by a gain in average roughness Ra of 81 %, an enhancement in the mean spacing of profile irregularities Sm of 34 %and an improvement in surface nano-hardness HIT of 17 % when compared to the machined surface.
