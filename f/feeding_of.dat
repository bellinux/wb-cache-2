5|$|Jean Keene (October 20, 1923 – January 13, 2009), {{also known}} as the Eagle Lady, was a former rodeo trick rider who became the subject of {{national}} attention due to her <b>feeding</b> <b>of</b> wild bald eagles on the Homer Spit in Homer, Alaska. Although she had many supporters for the feedings, she was also criticized for drawing a large population of eagles to the area. After her death, the city of Homer passed a law prohibiting the <b>feeding</b> <b>of</b> predatory birds.|$|E

5|$|Young orangutans also beg {{for food}} by such contact and {{accordingly}} their caretakers regurgitate to feed them. Indeed, behaviours of mouth to mouth <b>feeding</b> <b>of</b> premasticated food and ritualized mouth to mouth contact for bonding {{has been observed}} in anthropoid great apes such as gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees.

The basic body type is a {{terrestrial}} quadruped, but some mammals are adapted for life at sea, in the air, in trees, underground or on two legs.

5|$|The {{excavated}} area of {{the mound}} was demarcated into two zones {{on the basis of}} occupation and elevation. Northern sector of the mound is nearer to the sea coast while the southern sector is farther away from the coast. The ceramic find of crockery and cooking vessels found in the northern sector were indicative of mass <b>feeding</b> <b>of</b> sailors and traders who camped there. Wine stored in amphorae was the principal item imported from the western countries during the later part of the 2nd century BCE.|$|E
5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} <b>feeding</b> <b>of</b> females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5000|$|The usage <b>of</b> dual <b>feeds</b> <b>of</b> {{the same}} channel is a commonplace method for premium {{channels}} such as HBO, Showtime and Starz, {{in which the}} Pacific time zone <b>feed</b> <b>of</b> the primary channel is packaged with the East Coast <b>feed</b> <b>of</b> the main channel and the pay service's multiplex channels (if the premium channel has any). Most commonly, the Eastern and Pacific Time Zone <b>feeds</b> <b>of</b> only the main channel are packaged together, although some providers may also provide both coastal <b>feeds</b> <b>of</b> a premium service's multiplex channels. In some cases, cable networks (such as cable news and sports channels) [...] "fake" [...] the dual feed approach by recycling their same-day prime time programming during the overnight hours on a three (or four) hour cycle; in this case, the programs are automatically rebroadcast at the advertised time (or one hour later) in the Pacific Time Zone.|$|R

5|$|Guinea pigs {{benefit from}} feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in {{addition}} to food pellets which are often based from timothy. Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though some controversy exists over the <b>feeding</b> <b>of</b> alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa {{as a source for}} replenishment of protein, amino acids, and fiber.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was known}} for his public demonstrations of piety, and appears to have been {{genuinely}} devout. He promoted rich, luxurious Church services, and, unusually for the period, attended mass at least once a day. He gave generously to religious causes, paid for the <b>feeding</b> <b>of</b> 500 paupers each day and helped orphans. He fasted before commemorating Edward the Confessor's feasts, and may have washed the feet of lepers. Henry regularly went on pilgrimages, particularly to the abbeys of Bromholm, St Albans and Walsingham Priory, although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as an excuse to avoid dealing with pressing political problems.|$|E

The resolution's effective date was delayed until spring out of concern that the birds would either die of starvation or become highly aggressive if the feeding ended {{in the middle of}} winter.

5|$|Scholars {{divide the}} {{ministry}} of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of Satan.

This period includes the Sermon on the Mount, one of Jesus' major discourses, as well as the calming of the storm, the <b>feeding</b> <b>of</b> the 5,000, walking on water {{and a number of other}} miracles and parables. It ends with the Confession of Peter and the Transfiguration.|$|E
5|$|The cheetah is {{threatened}} by habitat loss through agricultural and industrial expansion; moreover, the animal apparently requires a large area to live in as indicated by its low population densities. The cheetah appears to be less capable than the leopard of coexisting with humans. As such, human interference can disturb the activities, such as hunting and <b>feeding,</b> <b>of</b> cheetah. With 76% of their range consisting of unprotected land, the cheetah are often targeted by farmers and pastoralists who attempt to protect their livestock. However, cheetahs typically do not prefer livestock for prey. Game hunters may also try to harm cheetah as these carnivores can deprive them of valuable game. Roadkill can be another threat, especially in areas where roads have been constructed near the natural habitat or protected areas. Cases of roadkill involving cheetahs have been reported from Kalmand, Tūrān, and Bafq. The threat is posed by infectious diseases is minor, given the low population densities and hence the minimal chance of infection.|$|E

This responsibility initially fell to Bridges, in addition to his duties as its commander; however, an Administrative Headquarters was later set up in Cairo in Egypt. Following the redeployment of the Australian infantry divisions to the Western Front it was relocated to London.

5|$|The eggs hatch {{after about}} three weeks and the young are {{attended}} by both parents. Males are present around the nest {{for most of the}} day, and females most of the night. The parents exchange nest duties in the morning and in the evening. Most of the <b>feeding</b> <b>of</b> the chicks occurs during the period where they swap nesting duties. Little feeding is done in the period of the day that is between the two duty swaps and no feeding is done between midnight and 6a.m. Chick mortality is highest in the first twenty days post hatching, with anywhere from 37 to 83% of hatchlings surviving to three weeks of age in the Everglades. During periods of food limitations and starvation events, the American white ibis tends to exhibit sex-dependent pre-fledgling mortality. For many bird species that have sexually dimorphic nestlings, mortality rates are higher for larger-sized male nestlings {{as a result of the}} parents' inability to meet its greater nutritional needs. However, in the case of the American white ibis, the male nestlings actually have a lower mortality rate as compared to the females despite being on average 15% greater in mass as compared to its female counterparts. Although current research has yet to discover the underlying factors to why the males tend to have better survival rates under such conditions, it is suspected that the parents tend to feed the larger male nestlings first because they are either perceived by the parents to have a higher chance of survival, or, being generally larger, the male nestlings simply out-compete the small females for food.|$|E
