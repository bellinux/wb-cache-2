5|$|In 1946 until mid-1947, the Piccards were {{consultants}} to General Mills (the cereal company and dominant industry in Minneapolis) working under Otto Winzen, who Jean had met through the university. Winzen and Jean proposed a stratosphere flight with 100 cluster balloons and secured a government {{contract with the}} Navy. Featured in Navy press releases, Jean was named a project scientist responsible for gondola design and for testing the balloon film materials. But he balked, both at making weekly status reports that made him feel like a lower-level employee, and {{at the prospect of}} General Mills owning the patents to his ideas. Working as a consultant, Jeannette threatened to break off ties with the Navy and General Mills unless she was allowed to fly with Jean. Unfortunately this began a rift between General Mills and the Piccards. They were both were fired in 1947, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> too critical of Winzen and General Mills staff.|$|E
5|$|In writing these {{desultory}} letters, I found I {{could not}} avoid being continually {{the first person}} – 'the little hero of each tale.' I tried to correct this fault, if it be one, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> designed for publication; but in proportion as I arranged my thoughts, my letter, I found, became stiff and affected: I, therefore, determined to let my remarks and reflections flow unrestrained, as I perceived that I could not give a just description of what I saw, but by relating the effect different objects had produced on my mind and feelings, whilst the impression was still fresh.|$|E

25|$|War often {{broke out}} between the Sizang and the Burmans of Kalay valley, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> enemies at wartime; but also friends during peacetime, {{conducting}} trades and exchanging gifts for peaceful co-existence, although they never fully trusted one another.|$|E
25|$|Twenty {{percent of}} inmates at the Solovki camps in 1928–1929 were imprisoned in {{connection}} with these affairs. Between 1928 and 1931, at least thirty-six bishops were imprisoned and exiled, and the total number surpassed 150 {{by the end of}} 1930. This did not mean, however, that clergy loyal to Sergii were safer <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> also widely attacked and arrested.|$|E
25|$|Ufthak was in {{the service}} of the Tower of Cirith Ungol, under the command of Shagrat. He was captured, poisoned, and then {{forgotten}} by Shelob.

He is later presumed to have perished from starvation.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposed}} post-trial move to Imperial Airways did {{not happen}} <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> already re-equipping, so the biplane was immediately broken up. The monoplane did do useful service at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough {{in the development of}} automatic pilots and in wireless experiments in RAF colours as K4241. It then served a few months as an RAF taxi before being scrapped at the end of 1937.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} after the {{declaration}} of the area as site for settlement and agricultural development, World War II broke out and the region was later placed under Japanese control, Although the extent of damage on properties {{and the number of}} lives lost during the war was nothing compared to other areas in the Philippines, early settlers of the region had difficulty rebuilding their lives after the war <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not spared from the wrath inflicted by the members of the Kalinga tribes from the north.|$|E
25|$|When Parliament {{ordered all}} theatres closed in 1642, the Fortune entered a slow but {{irreversible}} decline. The actors at least occasionally violated the order, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> raided and their property seized during a performance {{almost a year}} after the closure; between the expiration of the original order and the enactment of new, more stringent orders in 1649, the players returned to the theatre. In 1649, soldiers pulled down the stage and the gallery seats. By the Restoration, it had partially collapsed, and the masters of Dulwich sold what remained as scrap.|$|E

25|$|A good {{illustration}} of his status within Europe {{is the fact}} that Cnut and the King of Burgundy went alongside the emperor in the imperial procession and stood shoulder-to-shoulder with him on the same pedestal. Cnut and the emperor, in accord with various sources, took to one another's company like brothers, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> of a similar age. Conrad gave Cnut lands in the Mark of Schleswig—the land-bridge between the Scandinavian kingdoms and the continent—as a token of their treaty of friendship. Centuries of conflict in this area between the Danes and the Germans led to construction of the Danevirke, from Schleswig, on the Schlei, an inlet of the Baltic Sea, to the North Sea.|$|E

Closely tracing his popularity that It Started with a Kiss has given him, his company decided {{to give him the}} lead role for KO One as well as Calvin Chen and Aaron Yan <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> discovered around that same time. After KO One aired, HIM International Music decided {{that it was time for}} Fahrenheit to release their first studio album to fulfill fans' requests. Wang and Yan reprised their roles in It Started with a Kisss sequel, They Kiss Again.|$|E
25|$|Besides merchants, a {{great number}} of {{physicians}} were among the Spanish Jews in Amsterdam: Samuel Abravanel, David Nieto, Elijah Montalto, and the Bueno family; Joseph Bueno was consulted in the illness of Prince Maurice (April 1623). Jews were admitted as students at the university, where they studied medicine as the only branch of science of practical use to them, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not permitted to practise law, and the oath they would be compelled to take excluded them from the professorships. Neither were Jews taken into the trade-guilds: a resolution passed by the city of Amsterdam in 1632 (the cities being autonomous) excluded them. Exceptions, however, were made in the case of trades that related to their religion: printing, bookselling, and the selling of meat, poultry, groceries, and drugs. In 1655 a Jew was, exceptionally, permitted to establish a sugar-refinery.|$|E

25|$|A week later, the {{committee}} voted {{that the two}} complaints are sufficient in substance: the first complaint passed via a 41–14 vote, while the second complaint passed with a 41–16 vote, with Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino (PMP; Force of the Filipino Masses)'s Rufus Rodriguez of Cagayan de Oro's 2nd district abstaining as he refused to recognize the second complaint. The committee vote {{was the first time}} an impeachment complaint was deemed to be sufficient in substance since the Arroyo presidency. The minority bloc tried to delay the vote by objecting the approval of the minutes, and denying that they were supplied with copies of the complaints, even if their staff had earlier stated that they had received them. Lakas Kampi CMD's Simeon Datumanong of Maguindanao's 2nd district insisted that the second complaint be barred; Majority leader Neptali Gonzales II of Mandaluyong answered that while the constitution forbids two impeachment proceedings, it does not forbid two impeachment complaints, adding that the two complaints can be consolidated <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> simultaneously referred to {{the committee}}.|$|E
25|$|King Andrew II of Hungary {{granted the}} Burzenland region to the Teutonic Knights in 1211, {{with the purpose}} of {{ensuring}} security of the southeastern borders of his kingdom against the Cumans. The Teutonic Knights campaigned against the Cumans, on behalf of King Andrew, during the years of 1221–1225. However, the Teutonic Knights failed to defeat the Cumans and began to establish a country independent of the King of Hungary. In 1238, after Mongol attacks on Cumania, King Béla IV of Hungary offered refuge to the remainder of the Cuman people under their leader Khan Köten, who in turn vowed to convert his 40,000 families to Christianity. King Béla hoped to use the new subjects as auxiliary troops against the Mongols, who were already threatening Hungary. The Cumans were joined by the Iranian Jasz people, who had been living with the Cumans. Batu Khan of the Mongols then ordered Bela to stop giving refuge to the Cumans and made a particular point that if attacked the Cumans could easily run away, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> skilled horseman, but not so for the Hungarians, who were a sedentary nation and had no such luxury. Bela rejected this ultimatum.|$|E
25|$|Arguably, {{the most}} {{energetic}} missionary {{activity of the}} Augustinian Order has been displayed in the Philippine Islands. When Ferdinand Magellan discovered the Philippines (16 March 1521) and took possession {{of them in the}} name of the King of Spain, he was accompanied by the chaplain of the fleet, who preached the Gospel to the inhabitants, baptizing Kings Colambu and Siagu and 800 natives of Mindanao and Cebú, on Low Sunday, 7 April 1521. The effect of these conversions however, were soon almost negated. Magellan was killed in a fight with natives on the little island of Mactan on 27 April and the Catholic foundation established by the first Spanish missionaries almost disappeared. The missionaries brought from Mexico in 1543 by Ruy López Villalobos were not more successful, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> forced to return to Europe by way of Goa, having had little influence on the islanders. Under the Adelantado Legaspi who in 1565 established the sovereignty of Spain in the Philippines and selected Manila as the capital in 1571, Andrés de Urdaneta and 4 other Augustinian friars landed at Cebú in 1565, and at once began a very successful apostolate. The first houses of the Augustinians were established at Cebú, in 1565, and at Manila, in 1571.|$|E

25|$|By mid-May, {{the army}} had reached the {{vicinity}} of the heavily fortified Persian capital, Ctesiphon, where Julian partially unloaded some of the fleet and had his troops ferried across the Tigris by night. The Romans gained a tactical victory over the Persians before the gates of the city, driving them back into the city. However, the Persian capital was not taken, the main Persian army was still at large and approaching, while the Romans lacked a clear strategic objective. In the council of war which followed, Julian's generals persuaded him not to mount a siege against the city, given the impregnability of its defenses and the fact that Shapur would soon arrive with a large force. Julian not wanting to give up what he had gained and probably still hoping for the arrival of the column under Procopius and Sebastianus, set off east into the Persian interior, ordering the destruction of the fleet. This proved to be a hasty decision, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{on the wrong side of}} the Tigris with no clear means of retreat and the Persians had begun to harass them from a distance, burning any food in the Romans' path. Julian had not brought adequate siege equipment, so there was nothing he could do when he found that the Persians had flooded the area behind him, forcing him to withdraw. A second council of war on 16 June 363 decided that the best course of action was to lead the army back to the safety of Roman borders, not through Mesopotamia, but northward to Corduene.|$|E
500|$|Following {{their work}} on that film, the duo were brought in to revise the script for Zack Snyder's Watchmen, in an uncredited capacity.

500|$|The troops under Patton's command {{received}} the speech well. The general's strong reputation caused considerable excitement among his men, and they listened intently, in absolute silence, as he spoke. A majority indicated they enjoyed Patton's speaking style. As one officer recounted {{of the end}} of the speech, [...] "The men instinctively sensed the fact and the telling mark that they themselves would play in world history because of it, <b>for</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> being told as much right now. Deep sincerity and seriousness lay behind the General's colorful words, and the men well knew it, but they loved the way he put it as only he could do it." [...] Patton gave a humorous tone to the speech, as he intentionally sought to make his men laugh with his colorful delivery. Observers later noted the troops seemed to find the speeches very funny. In particular, Patton's use of obscene humor was well received by the enlisted men, as it was [...] "the language of the barracks".|$|E
