This {{archipelago}} located in Western Brittany is a shallow water area that comprises 11 islands and hosts a rich variety of marine life, including seaweed fields, benthic organisms, endangered seals and cetaceans. Three underwater autonomous recorders were moored at 10 -m depth and sampled at 32 kHz from June 2011 to November 2011. Here {{we report on the}} dependency of shallow water ambient noise level on wind speed in a biologically rich environment. First we extract the ambient noise level in presence of transient sounds produced by benthic organisms by removing <b>instantaneous</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> levels higher than a threshold computed using the kurtosis of the raw 10 sec time series. We then show that the ambient noise level allows to extract environmental information such as wind speed and biological rhythms and that 90 % of its variance is explained by wind speed. Dependence of ambient noise and ocean noise level to wind speed at several frequencies are compared to reference work by Wenz (1962) and previous shallow water studies.

40|$|Background: High-speed railway (HR, Electrified railway with {{service speed}} above 200 km/h.) noise and {{conventional}} railway (CR, Electrified railway with service speed under 200 km/h.) noise {{are different in}} both time and frequency domain. There is an urgent need to study the influence of HR noise and consequently, develop appropriate noise evaluation index and limits for the total railway noise including HR and CR noise. Methods: Based on binaural recording of HR and CR noises in a approximate semi-free field, noise annoyance and activity disturbance induced by maximal train pass-by events in China were investigated through laboratory subjective evaluation. 80 students within recruited 102 students, 40 males and 40 females, 23. 9 [*]±[*] 2. 1 years old, were finally selected as the subjects. After receiving noise stimulus via headphone of a binaural audio playback system, {{subjects were asked to}} express the annoyance or activity disturbance due to railway noise at a 0 - 100 numerical scale. Results: The results show that with the same annoyance rating (A) or activity disturbance rating (D), the A-weighted equivalent <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level (LAeq) of CR noise is approximately 7 dB higher than that of HR noise. Linear regression analysis between some acoustical parameters and A (or D) suggests that the coefficient of determination (R 2) is higher with the <b>instantaneous</b> fast A-weighted <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level (LAFmax) than that with LAeq. A combined acoustical parameter, LHC[*]=[*] 1. 74 LAFmax[*]+[*] 0. 008 LAFmax(Lp-LAeq), where Lp is the <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level, was derived consequently, which could better evaluate the total railway noise, including HR and CR noise. More importantly, with a given LHC, the noise annoyance of HR and CR noise is the same. Conclusions: Among various acoustical parameters including LHC and LAeq, A and D have the highest correlation with LHC. LHC has been proved to be an appropriate index to evaluate the total railway noise, including both HR and CR. However, {{it should be pointed out}} that this study provides suggestive evidence, rather than a final proof.

For this purpose, two laboratory experiments were carried out, during which controlled and natural 3 -min audio and audiovisual sequences were presented. Participants were asked to continuously assess the pleasantness of the sound environment along the sequence, and globally at its end. The results reveal that the global sound pleasantness is principally explained by {{the average of the}} instantaneous sound pleasantness values. Accounting for recency or trend effects improved the estimates of the global sound pleasantness over controlled sound sequences, but their contribution is not significant for the second group of stimuli, which are based on natural audio sequences and include visual information. In addition, models for global and continuous pleasantness, {{as a function of the}} <b>instantaneous</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level L eq, 1 s, are proposed. The instantaneous sound pleasantness is found to be mainly impacted by the average sound level over the past 6 s. A logarithmic fading mechanism, extracted from psychological literature, is also proposed for this modelling, and slightly improves the estimations. Finally, the globally perceived sound pleasantness can be accurately estimated from the sound pressure level of the sound sequences, explaining about 60 % of the variance in the global sound pleasantness ratings...|$|E

This thesis investigates methods to assess the diffusivity of sound fields in rooms and the prediction of sound transmission between coupled volumes using statistical approaches. Sound fields in a box-shaped room were assessed using ray tracing with the spatial correlation coefficient for <b>instantaneous</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure.</b> The results were compared with the theory for a three-dimensional diffuse field and propagating plane waves. Three different options were considered for the measurement lines: (1) pairs of points formed by one fixed point when the other point varies along the same line, (2) pairs of points with fixed spacing and (3) all permutations of points with variable spacing. The general conclusion is that option (1) can lead to conclusions that seem inappropriate. Options (2) and (3) {{were found to have}} potential as assessment procedures, but definitively characterising a sound field as diffuse was not possible. Sound transmission between coupled volumes was investigated using an empty cuboid, a cuboid with staggered barriers and a car cabin model based on Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) and Experimental SEA (ESEA). Experimental work on corridors was used to validate the ray tracing models. For sound transmission along an empty cuboid, the direct field was significant with highly absorptive surfaces such that a propagating two-dimensional model overestimated transmission for low absorption, and underestimated it for high absorption. SEA incorporating coupling loss factors from the general form of ESEA gave improved agreement with ray tracing and showed the importance of indirect coupling between subsystems. For a corridor with staggered barriers, source locations for the Power Injection Method used in ESEA were assessed to ensure accurate predictions of sound transmission along the corridor. For the corridor and car cabin, the general form of ESEA tends to always result in a working SEA model and be more accurate when a source position (point or surface) used for the power injection process is similar to the actual source position. This tends to be more apparent when using a single source rather than multiple sources...|$|E

Noise pollution is an unwanted sound that could give negative effects to human behaviors especially in sensitive area such as educational area. Universiti Malaysia Kelantan has three campuses which are in Pengkalan Chepa, Bachok and Jeli. Each campus has one site selected for noise level monitoring. These selected sites were selected due to hotspot area. The noise level was determined by calculating the average of the A- weighing, dB(A) which was obtained from the data sampling. The data were recorded for day and night to obtain the continuous of <b>instantaneous</b> <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> level. The equipment that been used in this study is TM- 102 Sound Level Meter Auto Ranging for measure the noise level for each campus. The average of noise level recorded for each campus were compared with maximum permissible sound Level for development by the Department of Environment. Since Pengk:alan Chepa, Jeli and Bachok are categorized as urban areas, the average of noise level recorded were compared with level 60 dB for day time and 50 dB for night time.

In this regard {{a wide variety of}} contactless and non-invasive laser optical and acoustic measurement techniques have matured in recent years to allow their application on full scale aircraft. Within a measurement campaign involving an Airbus A 320 DLR research aircraft inside a sound-attenuating hangar at Hamburg Airport, four image-based measurement techniques were applied in parallel to acquire data for the engine operating at varying conditions: stereoscopic PIV of the engine intake and jet exhaust flow, high frame rate BOS of the exhaust jet in combination with acoustic array measurements, IPCT/PROPAC technique for the measurement of fan blade deformation under load and MODE measurements for nacelle position monitoring. The objective of the ground tests was to establish a combined measurement data base to locate the zones within the engine jet exhaust flow where large, turbulent fluctuations in velocity and density produce noise. Simul-taneous application of PIV, BOS and acoustic array techniques were carried out in front and behind the left aircraft jet engine, for the characterization of inlet flow disturbance due to ground vortex formation, the turbulent free jet flow field as well as engine’s core and jet noise. The installed ground test instrumentation was operated in parallel to facilitate a simultaneous acquisition of various flow field parameters using different diagnostic approaches (<b>instantaneous</b> velocity, <b>sound</b> <b>pressure</b> and fluctuation, density fluctuations and fan blade deformation). The diagnostics were applied non-invasively to the aircraft and aeroengine, that is, the ground test hardware neither required modifications to the aircraft airframe or engines nor had any direct connection to the aircraft which significantly eased the certification and test approval procedure. Nonetheless parts of the test equipment had to be installed within the danger (safety) area of the engines and required numerous certification and approval steps.
