40|$|This paper {{develops}} a structural credit risk {{model of a}} bank that issues deposits, shareholders' equity, and fixed or floating coupon bonds {{in the form of}} contingent capital or subordinated debt. The return on the bank's assets follows a jump-diffusion process, and default-free interest rates are stochastic. The equilibrium pricing of the bank's deposits, contingent capital, and shareholders' equity is studied for various parameter values haracterizing the bank's risk and the contractual terms of its contingent capital. Allowing for the possibility of jumps in the bank's asset value, as might occur during a financial crisis, has distinctive implications for valuing contingent capital. Credit spreads on contingent capital are higher the lower is the value of shareholders' equity at which conversion occurs and the larger is the conversion <b>discount</b> <b>from</b> the bond's <b>par</b> value. The effect of requiring a decline in a financial stock price index for conversion (dual price trigger) is to make contingent capital more similar to non-convertible subordinated debt. The paper also examines the bank's incentive to increase risk when it issues different forms of contingent capital as well as subordinated debt. In general, a bank that issues contingent capital has a moral hazard incentive to raise its assets' risk of jumps, particularly when the value of equity at the conversion threshold is low. However, moral hazard when issuing contingent capital tends to be less than when issuing subordinated debt. Because it reduces effective leverage and the pressure for government bailouts, contingent capital deserves serious consideration as part of a package of reforms that stabilize the financial system and eliminate "Too-Big-to-Fail.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of L-alanine transport in luminal-membrane vesicles isolated either from whole cortex or <b>from</b> <b>pars</b> convoluta or pars recta of rabbit proximal tubules were studied by a rapid filtration technique {{and by a}} spectrophotometric method. Uptake of L-alanine by vesicles from whole cortex was mediated by both Na+-dependent and Na+-independent, but electrogenic, processes. The nature, mechanism and tubular localization of the transport systems were studied {{by the use of}} vesicles derived <b>from</b> <b>pars</b> convoluta and pars recta. In vesicles <b>from</b> <b>pars</b> recta transport of L-alanine was strictly dependent on Na+ and occurred via a dual transport system, namely a high-affinity (half-saturation 0. 14 mM) and a low-affinity system (half-saturation 9. 6 mM). The cation-dependent but Na+-unspecific transport system for L-alanine was exclusively localized to the pars convoluta, which also contained an Na+-preferring system of intermediate affinity (half saturation 2. 1 mM). A closer examination of the mechanism of transport of L-alanine in vesicles <b>from</b> <b>pars</b> convoluta revealed that an H+ gradient (extravesicular greater than intravesicular) can drive the transport of L-alanine into the vesicles both in the presence {{and in the absence of}} Na+. The physiological importance of various L-alanine transporters is briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{evidence}} for a factor secreted by bovine hypophyseal pars tuberalis that stimulates luteinizing hormone (LH) release <b>from</b> rat <b>pars</b> distalis cells is shown. The secretion products of bovine pars tuberalis cells into the culture medium were assayed on dispersed rat pars distalis cells in 30 min incubations and superfusion experiments. The culture medium <b>from</b> <b>pars</b> tuberalis total cell populations, added at a dose of 6 &# 956;g per tube, induced the greater LH release <b>from</b> <b>pars</b> distalis cells, without effect on follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) release. After pars tuberalis cells separation on a discontinuos Percoll gradient, only the culture medium of cells from 50 and 60 % strength Percoll were able to release LH <b>from</b> rat <b>pars</b> distalis cells. Therefore, cell fractions from 50 and 60 % strenght Percoll were cultured together. To elicit maximal LH release (6 times the basal output), {{with the addition of}} 2 &# 956;g of pars tuberalis protein was required, suggesting that these cells produce the factor or factors which affect pars distalis gonadotrope cells. After applying the pars tuberalis culture medium on 12 % SDS-PAGE, the band with biological activity was that of 66 -kDal. Fifty ng protein of its eluate released almost 9 times the basal output of LH <b>from</b> <b>pars</b> distalis cells.

40|$|Uptake of L-proline, hydroxy-L-proline and 5 -oxo-L-proline by luminal-membrane vesicles {{isolated}} {{either from}} whole cortex or <b>from</b> <b>pars</b> convoluta or pars recta of proximal tubules was studied by a spectrophotometric method. Uptake of L-proline and hydroxy-L-proline by vesicles from whole cortex was mediated by both Na+-dependent and Na+-independent, but electrogenic, processes, whereas transport of 5 -oxo-L-proline in these vesicles was strictly Na+-dependent. Eadie-Hofstee analysis of saturation-kinetic data suggested {{the presence of}} multiple transport systems in luminal-membrane vesicles from whole renal cortex for the uptake of all these amino acids. Tubular localization of the transport systems was studied {{by the use of}} vesicles derived <b>from</b> <b>pars</b> convoluta and <b>from</b> <b>pars</b> recta. In pars recta transport of all three amino acids was strictly dependent on Na+ and occurred via a high-affinity system (half-saturation: 0. 1 - 0. 3 mM). Cation-dependent but Na+-unspecific transport of low affinity for L-proline and hydroxy-L-proline was exclusively localized to the pars convoluta, which also contained a Na+-preferring system of intermediate affinity (half-saturation: L-proline, 0. 75 mM; hydroxy-L-proline, 1. 3 mM). 5 -Oxo-L-proline was transported by low-affinity and Na+-dependent systems in both pars convoluta and pars recta. Competition experiments revealed that transport systems for L-proline and hydroxy-L-proline are common, but indicated separate high-affinity transport systems for 5 -oxo-L-proline and L-proline in luminal-membrane vesicles <b>from</b> <b>pars</b> recta.

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} effect of micro-incision phacoemulsification combined with silicone oil removal <b>from</b> <b>pars</b> plana in eyes with silicone oil tamponade after vitrectomy. METHODS: Forty-three patients(43 eyes) with cataract and silicone oiltamponade after vitrectomy underwent micro-coaxial phacoemulsification combined with silicone oil removal <b>from</b> <b>pars</b> plana between February 2013 and November 2013. Intraocular lens was implanted at stage I in all cases. The best corrected visual acuity {{was observed at}} 3 mo after operation, and the complications were recorded. RESULTS: The best corrected visual acuity in 39 cases(91 %) was improved at 3 mo after operation, and the best outcome was 0. 6. There were still 4 cases(9 %) without improvement of visual acuity. There was no incidence of complications such as posterior capsular rupture, residual silicone oil, corneal endothelial decompensation, hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage, intraocular lens dislocation, secondary glaucoma and ora serrata mutilation after operation in all patients. CONCLUSION:Micro-invision phacoemulsification combined with silicone oil removal <b>from</b> <b>pars</b> plana is an effective and safe method for eyes with cataract and silicone oil tamponade after vitrectomy...|$|R
