5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{issuance}} of the first advisory on the tropical depression, {{the government of the}} Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm watch from Barahona to <b>its</b> <b>border</b> with Haiti, while a tropical storm watch was issued from Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic westward to Port-au-Prince. The United States' National Hurricane Center in Miami recommended interests in eastern Cuba to monitor the progress of the storm. When the depression was 205miles (330km) south-southeast of Santo Domingo, the Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm warning from Punta Palenque to <b>its</b> <b>border</b> with Haiti. While located 155miles (250km) from the coast of Hispaniola, the government of the Dominican Republic extended the tropical storm warning eastward to Isla Saona, while the government of Haiti upgraded its watch area to a tropical storm warning along the coast. The National Hurricane Center also recommended citizens in the Bahamas to monitor the progress of the storm. After the heavy rainfall began in the Dominican Republic, officials evacuated citizens of low-lying areas.|$|E

5|$|Czechoslovakia's {{hardline}} {{communist government}} agreed to close <b>its</b> <b>border</b> with East Germany to choke off the exodus. The closure produced uproar across East Germany and the GDR government's bid to humiliate refugees by expelling {{them from the}} country in sealed trains backfired disastrously. Torn-up identity papers and East German passports littered the tracks as the refugees threw {{them out of the}} windows. When the trains passed through Dresden, 1,500East Germans stormed the main railway station in an attempt to board. Dozens were injured and the station concourse was virtually destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the Thai government’s {{department}} of irrigation met {{the demands of}} Living River Siam and the Assembly of the Poor with a promise to halt all future dam projects, which was accepted with cautious optimism. To circumvent the issue of domestic damming, in 2007 the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) announced {{plans to build a}} series of dams on Burma's Salween River along <b>its</b> <b>border</b> with Thailand. Living River Siam opposed this plan, citing the threat of environmental destruction in Burma's Shan, Karenni, and Karen states as well as Mae Hong Son Province.|$|E
5|$|Ludlow Castle was {{probably}} founded by Walter de Lacy around 1075. Walter {{had arrived in}} England in 1066 as part of William fitzOsbern's household during the Norman conquest of England.

5|$|The use of lethal {{force on}} the Berlin Wall was an {{integral}} part of the East German state's policy towards <b>its</b> <b>border</b> system. Nonetheless, the East German government was well aware that border killings had undesirable consequences. The West German, US, British and French authorities protested killings when they occurred and the international reputation of East Germany was damaged as a result. It also undermined the East German government's support at home.|$|E
5|$|About {{nine hours}} after Ernesto became a {{tropical}} storm, {{the government of}} Haiti issued a tropical storm watch from <b>its</b> <b>border</b> with the Dominican Republic to the southwestern tip of the country. As the storm strengthened, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning, and about 15hours prior to its closest approach the warning was replaced with a hurricane warning. Several low-lying citizens in Gonaïves were evacuated after local meteorologists anticipated up to 20inches (500mm) of rain in some mountainous areas. Additionally, authorities advised residents in shanty towns near the ocean to evacuate to emergency shelters.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Nimitz {{recommended}} to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that development {{and control of}} the base facilities be placed under SOPAC by extending <b>its</b> <b>border</b> westward to include the Admiralties. MacArthur was furious; the borders of SWPA could not be changed without the consent of the Australian government. Nimitz's proposal was eventually turned down by the Joint Chiefs but not before MacArthur restricted access to the facilities to ships of the United States Seventh Fleet and British Pacific Fleet. Halsey was summoned to MacArthur's headquarters in Brisbane on 3March 1944, and the two agreed to a compromise. Responsibility {{for the development of the}} base passed from Krueger's Alamo Force to Kinkaid's Allied Naval Forces on 18May 1944. It was proposed control would ultimately pass to SOPAC but it never did.|$|E

5|$|After Texas's annexation, Mexico broke {{diplomatic}} relations with the United States. While the United States claimed that Texas's border stretched to the Rio Grande, Mexico claimed it was the Nueces River. While the former Republic of Texas could not enforce <b>its</b> <b>border</b> claims, the United States had the military strength and {{the political will to}} do so. President Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor south to the Rio Grande on January 13, 1846. A few months later Mexican troops routed an American cavalry patrol in the disputed area in the Thornton Affair starting the Mexican–American War. The first battles of the war were fought in Texas: the Siege of Fort Texas, Battle of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma. After these decisive victories, the United States invaded Mexican territory ending the fighting in Texas.|$|E
5|$|British {{control of}} Gibraltar enabled the Allies {{to control the}} {{entrance}} to the Mediterranean during the Second World War. It was attacked on several occasions by German, Italian and Vichy French forces, though without causing much damage. The Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco declined to join a Nazi plan to occupy Gibraltar but revived Spain's claim to the territory after the war. As the territorial dispute intensified, Spain closed <b>its</b> <b>border</b> with Gibraltar between 1969 and 1985 and communications links were severed. Spain's position was supported by Latin American countries but was rejected by Britain and the Gibraltarians themselves, who vigorously asserted their right to self-determination. Discussions of Gibraltar's status have continued between Britain and Spain but have not reached any conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Croatia and Slovenia started {{negotiations}} to define maritime borders in the Gulf of Piran in 1992 {{but failed to}} agree, resulting in a dispute. Both countries also declared their economic zones, which partially overlap. Croatia's application to become an EU member state was initially suspended pending resolution of <b>its</b> <b>border</b> disputes with Slovenia. These were eventually settled with an agreement to accept the decision of an international arbitration commission set up via the UN, enabling Croatia to progress towards EU membership. The dispute has caused no major practical problems in areas other than the EU membership negotiations progress, even before the arbitration agreement.|$|E

5|$|In early April 1993, the Armenian forces {{captured}} Kelbajar, a city {{outside the}} originally contested areas, causing international {{attention to the}} conflict. Turkey closed <b>its</b> <b>border</b> with Armenia, while the United Nations passed a resolution condemning the act. In the summer of 1993, Armenian forces gained more territories and, by August controlled Fizuli, Jebrail, and Zangelan. By early 1994, both countries were devastated by the war. On 5 May, the Bishkek Protocol was signed by {{the heads of the}} parliaments of Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, backed by Armenia, established de facto control of these lands. Nagorno-Karabakh (also known as Artsakh to Armenians) remains internationally unrecognized and a de jure part of Azerbaijan. However, it is in de facto unified with Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Netherlandish artists found {{increasingly}} inventive ways {{to highlight}} and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries; such techniques included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space. They explored {{the interplay between}} the three essential components of a manuscript: border, miniature and text. An example is the Nassau book of hours (c.1467–80) by the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy, in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects. These elements achieved their effect by being broadly painted, as if scattered across the gilded surface of the miniatures. This technique was continued by, among others, the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland (possibly Gerard Horenbout), known for his innovative page layout. Using various illusionistic elements, he often blurred {{the line between the}} miniature and <b>its</b> <b>border,</b> frequently using both in his efforts to advance the narrative of his scenes.|$|E
