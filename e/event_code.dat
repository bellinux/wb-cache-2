The de- sign of the event block is inspired from the behavior of biological neurons that process signals in analog domain and transmit them as spike events. In the configurable event block implemented here, no events are trans- mitted when the signals are relatively constant thereby leading to lower energy dissipation and better utilization of resources in analog arrays. The block diagram and the circuit schematics of the <b>event</b> <b>coded</b> configurable analog block are described.

Materials and Methods : The data were obtained from a literature review and expert consultation, followed by adding to and revising the established hemovigilance code system and guidelines to develop reportable <b>event</b> <b>codes</b> for hospital blood banks. The Medical Error Reporting System-Transfusion Medicine developed in the US and other <b>codes</b> of reportable <b>events</b> were added to the Korean version of the Biologic Products Deviation Report (BPDR) developed by the Korean Red Cross Blood Safety Administration, then using these codes, mapping work was conducted. We deduced outcomes suitable for practice, referred to the results of the advisory councils, and conducted a survey with experts and blood banks practitioners. Results : We developed reportable <b>event</b> <b>codes</b> that were applicable to hospital blood banks and could cover blood safety - from blood product safety to blood transfusion safety - and also presented expansion strategies for hospital blood banks. Conclusion : It was necessary to add 10 major categories to the blood transfusion safety stage and 97 reportable <b>event</b> <b>codes</b> to the blood safety stage.

The microphone system is designed to receive external inputs in the spike time domain to actively control the RGT response, a feature not present in other MEMS microphone systems implemented so far.
