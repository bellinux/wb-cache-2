50|$|Simply stated, the {{inherent}} {{properties of the}} piezoelectric accelerometers made it a much better alternative to the strain <b>gage</b> <b>types</b> because of its high frequency response, {{and its ability to}} generate high resonant frequencies. The piezoelectric accelerometer allowed for a reduction in its physical size at the manufacturing level and it also provided for a higher g (standard gravity) capability relative to the strain <b>gage</b> <b>type.</b> By comparison, the strain <b>gage</b> <b>type</b> exhibited a flat frequency response above 200 Hz while the piezoelectric type provided a flat response up to 10,000 Hz. These improvements made it possible for measuring the high frequency vibrations associated with the quick movements and short duration shocks of aircraft which before was not possible with the strain <b>gage</b> <b>types.</b> Before long, the technological benefits of the piezoelectric accelerometer became apparent and in the late 1940s, large scale production of piezoelectric accelerometers began. Today, piezoelectric accelerometers are used for instrumentation in the fields of engineering, health and medicine, aeronautics and many other different industries.|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{prediction}} {{of the high}} heat transfer rates experienced during the hypersonic portion of planetary entry and descent is critical to vehicle survival. Two types of sensors {{that can be used}} to measure surface heat flux are coaxial thermocouple gages and thin film resistance thermometers. Individually, both <b>types</b> of <b>gages</b> have been used successfully in a number of studies [1 – 19]. Both thermocouple and thin film gages measure surface temperature from which heat transfer can be calculated. Both have µs response times, and can be flush-mounted in models. Coaxial thermocouples are robust, can survive challenging experimental conditions, and are typically used in higher enthalpy flows. Thin film resistance gages typically provide improved signal levels, but are less robust, have to be individually calibrated, and are typically used in lower enthalpy flows. As a result, there are few studies which directly compare measurements from the two <b>types</b> of <b>gages.</b> In the present work, we perform experimental measurements at a range of intermediate enthalpies in hypervelocity flow and make direct comparisons between temperature histories and heat flux data obtained from thermocouple and thin film gages...|$|R
40|$|The {{variation}} of shrinkage strain within beam depth was examined through four series of time-dependent laboratory experiments on unreinforced concrete beam specimens. Two types of beam specimens, horizontally cast and vertically cast, were tested; shrinkage variation {{was observed in}} the horizontally cast specimens. This indicated that the shrinkage variation within the beam depth was due to water bleeding and tamping during {{the placement of the}} fresh concrete. Shrinkage strains were measured within the beam depth by two <b>types</b> of strain <b>gages,</b> surface-attached and embedded. The shrinkage strain distribution within the beam depth showed a consistent tendency for the two <b>types</b> of <b>gages.</b> The test beams were cut into four sections after completion of the test, and the cutting planes were divided into four equal sub-areas to measure the aggregate concentration for each sub-area of the cutting plane. The aggregate concentration increased towards the bottom of the beam. The shrinkage strain distribution was estimated by Hobbs’ equation, which accounts for the change of aggregate volume concentration...|$|R

40|$|New {{methods and}} {{experimental}} techniques {{were developed in}} this research to quantify the incident heat flux, absorbed (net) heat flux into a sample, and heat transfer coefficient for samples exposed to mixed mode (radiation and convection) heat transfer typical in fires. Net heat flux into the material was measured at elevated temperatures using a recently developed hybrid heat flux gage, which is both a thermopile <b>type</b> <b>gage</b> {{as well as a}} slug calorimeter with an operating temperature> 1000 ºC without cooling. The heat transfer coefficient was determined as a function of time using the hybrid gage output only through a reference state approach. The net heat flux and heat transfer coefficient were then used to calculate a cold surface heat flux and the adiabatic surface temperature. Experiments were performed in the cone calorimeter at different heat fluxes to quantify the incident heat flux, net heat flux, heat transfer coefficient, cold surface heat flux, and adiabatic surface temperature as a function of time. Measured heat transfer coefficients were 9 – 18 % different than values calculated using idealized natural convection correlations. The cold surface heat fluxes determined with the hybrid gage were within 5 % of cold surface heat fluxes measured using a water-cooled Schmidt-Boelter heat flux gage...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} evaluation of three fully instrumented instructive test-rigs to study gear box efficiency and fault diagnosis of joints, roller bearings and gears. To analyze gear box efficiency, a back-to-back test-rig with mechanically closed energy loop was developed according to the FZG principle. An electrical motor with adjustable flange coupling was integrated in the loop. The efficiency of the gears can be determined very accurately by measuring the motor power {{that is needed to}} drive the closed loop as a function of speed, locked in torque, type of oil and oil immersion depth. The second test-rig consists of a driven shaft with adjustable motor position and excited bearing house. This enables the analysis of vibrations resulting from bearing defects and shaft misalignment. Bearings with three fault patterns (ball, inner ring or outer ring defect) are analyzed under radial loading conditions and broad speed range (10 - 3000 rpm). Moreover, single and double cardanic joints and torsionally flexible <b>jaw</b> <b>type</b> couplings are tested under radial and angular shaft misalignment. The third test rig is a closed electromechanical loop used for fault diagnosis of gear mesh defects under constant or variable torque loading. The experimental results are consistent with analytical calculations. status: publishe...|$|R

Foil strain gages used in a comparative manner reveal that the apparent strain of weldable strain gages is not sufficiently known to acquire accurate low level thermal stress data. Apparent strain data acquired from coupon tests reveals a large scatter in apparent strain characteristics among the weldable strain gages. It is concluded that apparent strain data for individual weldable strain gages must be required prior to installation if valid thermal stress data is to be obtained through the temperature range of room temperature to 755 K (900 F) ...|$|R
40|$|Eunicida have {{a complex}} jaw {{apparatus}} with a fossil record {{dating back to}} the latest Cambrian. Traditionally, Eunicidae, Onuphidae, and Lumbrineridae were considered closely related families having labidognath maxillae, whereas Oenonidae with prionognath type maxillae were thought to be derived. Molecular phylogenies place Oenonidae with Eunicidae/Onuphidae, and Lumbrineridae as the most basal taxon. Re-evaluation of the <b>jaw</b> <b>types</b> based on morphology and ontogeny demonstrated that the labidognaths Eunicidae and Onuphidae have a closer relationship to the prionognath Oenonidae than was previously thought. Lumbrineridae are neither labidognath nor prionognath; therefore a new type, Symmetrognatha, is proposed. Homologies of jaw elements and considerations of functional aspects of the jaw apparatus are explored to present a hypothesis of the Eunicida phylogeny. The earliest fossils are of placognath and ctenognath types, lacking maxillary carriers. While the former are extinct, the latter are represented by the extant Dorvilleidae. The interpretation of relationships between the carrier-bearing families depends on whether the carriers are thought to have evolved once only or twice independently. The similarity of the carrier structure and their associated muscles suggests the former, placing the Lumbrineridae as sister to Eunicidae/Onuphidae and Oenonidae. However, the ontogeny of the eunicid/onuphid apparatus as well as its adult structure differ greatly from those of lumbrinerids, indicating that the lumbrinerid carriers may have evolved independently and earlier than in eunicids/onuphids and oenonids...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Whilst many {{questions}} and doubts still remain, today {{the use of}} dental im-plants has gained an increasing popularity amongst patients as well as dentists. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the survival rate in using such implants over a 10 year period. Materials and Methods: In this study, 3050 ITI implants placed in 1000 patients with the mean age of 49. 5 years (54. 4 % males and 44. 6 % females) during 1050 stages were evalu-ated for the survival rate. The present study is a descriptive, time based analysis of all the files of patients that have been treated using dental implants over a period of 10 years. General information, number of implants in each <b>jaw,</b> <b>type</b> of implant surface, type of edentulous area, time span of Prosthodontic therapy and the endurance of the implants were gathered. Results: Incidence of failure was as low as 2 % and the number of implant failures was 23 implants (0. 7 %). These failures were seen in 13 implants in the upper jaw of 12 patients and 10 implants in the lower jaw of nine patients. In other words, the comprehensive sur-vival rate was seen in 98 % of the patients and 99. 3 % of the implants. Conclusion: The use of dental implants in treatment of missing teeth is favorable regard-less of the subject’s age, sex and type of the edentulous area and a very high survival rate seems feasible...|$|R
40|$|The current jaw {{model used}} by {{students}} from the East Carolina School of Dental Medicine to practice tooth extractions does not accurately simulate the forces in a real human mouth. Originally multiple alternative designs were generated and divided into three different categories: tooth material, full or partial jaw, tooth attachment method, sensor type, and alert system. These alternatives were analyzed and the chosen ones were metal teeth for the tooth material, full jaw for the <b>jaw</b> <b>type,</b> fixed with pivot for the attachment method, strain gages on the forceps for the sensor type, and LED for the alarm system. After further analysis {{it was decided that}} the following changes would be made. Instead of having one full jaw, individual teeth were mounted on rectangular prism and cylindrical bases. Strain gages were placed {{on the side of the}} rectangular bases to determine bending moments and to the cylindrical bases to determine twisting moments applied to the teeth. The LED alarm system was used alert the user when certain moment thresholds are met. A prototype was built and tested and the design met the functional requirements of the engineering design specifications. Recommendations were provided to make the design more commercially feasible. Recommendations included assembling some of the electrical components in house, sending the models out to be manufactured by a third party, putting the LED lights closer to the model, and mounting the models in a way to better simulate a real extraction.
