5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics. Associated conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), learning disabilities and sleep disorders. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD {{do not appear to be}} associated with disruptive behavior or <b>functional</b> <b>impairment,</b> while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed.|$|E
25|$|Several recent {{evaluations}} {{found that}} cataract surgery can meet expectations only when significant <b>functional</b> <b>impairment</b> due to cataracts exists before surgery. Visual function estimates such as VF-14 {{have been found}} to give more realistic estimates than visual acuity testing alone. In some developed countries, a trend to overuse cataract surgery has been noted, which may lead to disappointing results.|$|E
25|$|When {{structural}} or neurological impairments are not observed, {{all four}} diagnostic systems allow CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure {{to be assessed}} in terms of <b>functional</b> <b>impairments.</b> <b>Functional</b> <b>impairments</b> are deficits, problems, delays, or abnormalities due to prenatal alcohol exposure (rather than hereditary causes or postnatal insults) in observable and measurable domains related to daily functioning, {{often referred to as}} developmental disabilities. There is no consensus on a specific pattern of <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> due to prenatal alcohol exposure and only CDC guidelines label developmental delays as such, so criteria (and FASD diagnoses) vary somewhat across diagnostic systems.|$|R
40|$|Background. People with {{a mental}} {{disorder}} have {{high rates of}} service utilization for emotional or addiction problems. Little {{is known about the}} role of <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> and low social support in such service use. This article investigates: (1) whether the presence of multiple <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> mediates the link between mental disorder and service use; and (2) whether social support modifies that association. Methods. Data were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study, NEMESIS, a prospective general population study. Predictors of service use (mental disorder; functional impairments; social support) were recorded in the second wave of the study, and service use in the third wave. Results. Persons with a DSM-III-R disorder and persons with multiple <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> were three to seven times as likely to use primary or mental health care. People with low perceived social support were two to three times as likely to use them, and living alone increased the likelihood by 30 % to 80 %. The effect of mental disorder on service use was mediated by multiple <b>functional</b> <b>impairments.</b> In people with a mental disorder, low levels of social support intensified mental health service use. Conclusion. Service utilization by people with mental problems can be better understood through a model incorporating: (1) independent effects of mental disorder, <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> and social support on service use; (2) a mediating effect of multiple <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> on the link between mental disorder and service use; and (3) interaction effects of mental disorder and low social support on service use...|$|R

25|$|If it has metastasized to {{the lymph}} nodes, the 5-year {{survival}} is around 5% to 15%. For metastatic renal cell carcinoma, factors which may present a poor prognosis include a low Karnofsky performance-status score (a standard way of measuring <b>functional</b> <b>impairment</b> {{in patients with}} cancer), a low haemoglobin level, {{a high level of}} serum lactate dehydrogenase, and a high corrected level of serum calcium. For non-metastatic cases, the Leibovich scoring algorithm may be used to predict post-operative disease progression.|$|E
25|$|The TUG flap (also the TMG flap) {{consists}} of the gracilis muscle and a transversely-oriented island of skin and fat on the superior inner thigh. Sacrifice of the gracilis muscle does not result in <b>functional</b> <b>impairment.</b> The TUG flap is nourished by the ascending branch of the medial circumflex femoral artery with two venae comitantes, which come from the profunda femoris vessels. The vessels are routinely anastomosed to the internal mammary vessels, instead of to the thoraco-dorsal vessels in the axilla, because the blood vessels of the TUG flap are relatively short.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{treatment of}} psychiatric medication and psychotherapy {{has become the}} most common mode of psychiatric treatment in current practice, but contemporary practice also includes a wide variety of other modalities, e.g., assertive community treatment, community reinforcement, and supported employment. Treatment may be delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the severity of <b>functional</b> <b>impairment</b> or on other aspects of the disorder in question. Research and treatment within psychiatry as a whole are conducted on an interdisciplinary basis, e.g., with epidemiologists, mental health counselors, nurses, psychologists, public health specialists, radiologists, and/or social workers.|$|E
40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the {{lifestyle}} of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and its influence on symptoms of CFS. The present study aimed to investigate the lifestyle of patients with CFS, and to assess whether lifestyle factors are related to fatigue and <b>functional</b> <b>impairments.</b> Methods: Two hundred and forty-seven patients fulfilling the Center for Disease Control criteria for CFS were included. Validated questionnaires were used to collect data on lifestyle factors, smoking, intake of alcohol, fat, fibres, fruit and vegetables, body mass index (BMI), fatigue severity and <b>functional</b> <b>impairments.</b> Results: Of the CFS patients, 23 % smoked, 32 % had an unhealthy BMI, and none had an unhealthy alcohol intake. A majority had an unhealthy food intake: 70 % had unhealthy fat, fruit and vegetable intake, and 95 % had unhealthy fibre intake. Compared with the general Dutch population, significantly fewer CFS patients were overweight. Significantly more female CFS patients abstained from alcohol, and fewer male CFS patients smoked. Unhealthy lifestyle factors were not significantly associated with fatigue severity or <b>functional</b> <b>impairments.</b> Conclusions: CFS patients tend to lead a healthier lifestyle compared to the general Dutch population. However, no relationship was found between lifestyle factors and fatigue severity and <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> in CF...|$|R
40|$|This article {{develops}} {{a model of}} the relationships among <b>functional</b> <b>impairments,</b> work disability, employment participation, and wage offers. The model is estimated separately for males and females with data from the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation. Using estimates of disability and wage equations, we rank 25 <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> by severity of disability, and estimate the wage penalty associated with each impairment. The results show that limitations to mobility and strength are relatively more disabling for males than for females, while the opposite is true for limitations to sensory capacities and appearance. ...|$|R

25|$|Gage {{displayed}} {{significant changes}} in behavior after his injury, but the nature, extent, and duration of these changes {{have been difficult to}} establish. Only a handful of sources give direct information on what Gage was like (either before or after the accident), the mental changes published after his death were much more dramatic than anything reported while he was alive, and few sources are explicit about the period of Gage's life to which each of their various descriptions of him (which vary widely in their implied level of <b>functional</b> <b>impairment)</b> is meant to apply.|$|E
25|$|SSRIs are a second-line {{treatment}} of adult obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) with mild <b>functional</b> <b>impairment</b> and as first-line treatment {{for those with}} moderate or severe impairment. In children, SSRIs {{can be considered as}} a second-line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects. SSRIs are efficacious in the {{treatment of}} OCD; patients treated with SSRIs are about twice as likely to respond to treatment as those treated with placebo. Efficacy has been demonstrated both in short-term treatment trials of 6 to 24 weeks and in discontinuation trials of 28 to 52 weeks duration.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} myopathies, the {{clinical}} manifestations of MTM/CNM are most notably muscle weakness and associated disabilities. Congenital forms often present with neonatal low muscle tone, severe weakness, delayed developmental milestones (particularly gross motor milestones such as head control, crawling, and walking) and pulmonary complications (presumably due to {{weakness of the}} muscles responsible for respiration). While some patients with centronuclear myopathies remain ambulatory throughout their adult life, others may never crawl or walk and may require wheelchair use for mobility. There is substantial variability {{in the degree of}} <b>functional</b> <b>impairment</b> among the various centronuclear myopathies. Although this condition only affects the voluntary muscles, several children have suffered from cardiac arrest, possibly due to the additional stress placed on the heart.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} symptom persistence in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the development of comorbidities, and psycho-stimulant usage patterns. Follow-up studies were conducted in 37 patients with ADHD and 22 healthy controls, aged 10 and 18, four years after their first assessment. The ADHD was rated as persistent if participants met all DSM IV criteria for syndromic or sub-threshold persistence, or had <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> (<b>functional</b> persistence). Of the 37 ADHD patients we reevaluated, 75 % had persistent symptoms, and psychiatric comorbidities with additional <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> and academic problems were more common than in controls. These follow-up findings show a high comorbidity associated with ADHD and support the importance of evaluation and treatment for ADHD and comorbidities throughout life...|$|R
40|$|Endophenotypes {{represent}} intermediate phenotypes on {{the putative}} causal pathway from the genotype to the phenotype.

Neurocognitive and neurophysiological <b>impairments</b> that suggest <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> associated with schizophrenia have been proposed as endophenotypes. However, {{few studies have examined}} the structural variations in the brain that might underlie the <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> as useful endophenotypes for schizophrenia.

40|$|Objective: A {{subgroup}} {{of patients with}} Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) has cognitive impairments, reflected by deviant neuropsychological test performance. However, abnormal test scores can also be caused by suboptimal effort. We hypothesized that worse neuropsychological test performance and underperformance were {{related to each other}} and to a smaller reduction in fatigue, <b>functional</b> <b>impairments,</b> physical limitations and higher dropout rates following cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for CFS. Methods: Data were drawn from a previous trial, in which CFS patients were randomized to two conditions; 1) guided self-instruction and additional CBT (n = 84) or 2) waiting period followed by regular CBT for CFS (n = 85). Underperformance was assessed using the Amsterdam Short Term Memory Test (< 84). To test neuropsychological test performance, the Symbol Digit Modalities Task, a simple reaction time task and a choice reaction time task were used. Interaction effects were determined between underperformance and neuropsychological test performance on therapy outcomes. Results: Underperformance was associated to worse neuropsychological test performance, but there were no significant interaction effects of these two factors by therapy on fatigue severity, <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> and physical limitations, but there was a significant main effect of underperformance on <b>functional</b> <b>impairments,</b> physical limitations and dropout rates. Conclusion: Underperformance or neuropsychological test performance was not related to the change in fatigue, <b>functional</b> <b>impairments,</b> and physical limitations following CBT for CFS. However, underperforming patients did drop out more often. Therapists should pay attention to beliefs and behavioral or environmental factors that might maintain underperformance and increase the risk of dropout...|$|R
25|$|Reduced partial {{pressures}} of {{oxygen in the}} arteries due to intermittent hypoxia are sensed by and stimulate the carotid body, a chemoafferent receptor. The activated carotid body triggers the release of serotonin that attach to serotonin receptors {{on the surface of}} motoneurons, such as the phrenic motoneuron in the case of respiratory recovery. This signal transduction pathway then uses downstream molecules such as TrkB, BDNF, and PKA to increase the synaptic output of the involved motor neuron which in turn increases the motor output of the involved muscles and, thus, decreases <b>functional</b> <b>impairment.</b> As the amount of intermittent hypoxia changes the amount of serotonin release and, as a result, the amount of LTF, this process exhibits metaplasticity. Metaplasticity occurs when the LTF is itself plastic or variable.|$|E
25|$|The CPTSD-RI, {{along with}} all other {{assessments}} attempting to measure the severity of child PTSD, had several limitations. First, the CPTSD-RI did not assess {{for all of the}} PTSD symptoms and thus could not provide an accurate assessment of PTSD severity. Additionally, the CPTSD-RI did not assess for <b>functional</b> <b>impairment</b> related to experience with trauma, a limit of many other self-report assessments. These limitations can be combatted by structured interviews given by trained therapists in schools or in a clinical setting. This, however, is problematic because personal interviews are expensive for the families or schools that take part in them, especially when large groups of children are studied, and time consuming. Thus, the CPSS was created to combat these limitations without the need for a supplemental interview. Validated screening tests like the CPSS tests the efficacy of treatment techniques. Without CPSS, the treatments would have no valid test, and children who have experienced trauma will not get the help they require.|$|E
500|$|Because comorbid {{conditions}} such as OCD and ADHD can be more impairing than tics, these conditions are included in an evaluation of patients presenting with tics. [...] "It is critical {{to note that the}} comorbid conditions may determine functional status more strongly than the tic disorder," [...] according to Samuel Zinner, MD. The initial assessment of a patient referred for a tic disorder should include a thorough evaluation, including a family history of tics, ADHD, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and other chronic medical, psychiatric and neurological conditions. Children and adolescents with TS who have learning difficulties are candidates for psychoeducational testing, particularly if the child also has ADHD. Undiagnosed comorbid conditions may result in <b>functional</b> <b>impairment,</b> and it is necessary to identify and treat these conditions to improve functioning. Complications may include depression, sleep problems, social discomfort, self-injury, anxiety, personality disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorders.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{associations}} among <b>functional</b> <b>impairments,</b> strain and depressive symptoms for caregivers of individuals with brain tumour and other cancers. Sixty-three caregivers (71 % female) of individuals with brain tumour (n = 27) and other cancers (n = 36) were recruited from community services. Participants rated their level of depressive symptoms and strain and the <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> of the individual with cancer. Overall, approximately 25 % of the total caregiver sample was in the clinical range for depressive symptoms. For caregivers of individuals with brain tumour, strain {{was significantly related to}} depressive symptoms (r =. 57) and the individual's <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> (r = -. 58); however, level of depressive symptoms was not significantly related to <b>functional</b> <b>impairments</b> (p >. 05). For caregivers of individuals with other cancer, level of depressive symptoms was significantly correlated with strain (r =. 50) and their relatives' degree of cognitive, interpersonal and emotional difficulties (r = -. 36 -. 46), but not with activities of daily living (p >. 05). In a multivariate analysis involving all the caregivers, strain predicted depressive symptoms (R 2 =. 32, p <. 001) after controlling for gender and cancer type. In addition, strain was found to significantly mediate the effects of the interpersonal and emotional difficulties of individuals with cancer on caregiver depressive symptoms. Overall, these findings highlight the need to develop and evaluate strategies for alleviating the role strain associated with supporting individuals with cancer.

500|$|In the {{differential}} diagnosis (finding the correct diagnosis between diseases that have overlapping features) of some obstructive lung diseases, DPB is often considered. A number of DPB symptoms resemble those found with other obstructive lung diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. Wheezing, coughing with sputum production, and shortness of breath are common symptoms in such diseases, and obstructive respiratory <b>functional</b> <b>impairment</b> is found on pulmonary function testing. Cystic fibrosis, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, excess mucus production, and infection; but DPB does not cause disturbances of the pancreas nor the electrolytes, as does CF, so the two diseases are different and probably unrelated. [...] DPB is distinguished {{by the presence of}} lesions that appear on X-rays as nodules in the bronchioles of both lungs; inflammation in all tissue layers of the respiratory bronchioles; and its higher prevalence among individuals with East Asian lineage.|$|E
500|$|Most {{cases of}} Tourette's in older {{individuals}} are mild and almost unrecognizable. When symptoms are {{severe enough to}} warrant referral to clinics, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often associated with Tourette's. In children with tics, the additional presence of ADHD is associated with <b>functional</b> <b>impairment,</b> disruptive behavior, and tic severity. Compulsions resembling tics are present in some individuals with OCD; [...] "tic-related OCD" [...] is hypothesized to be a subgroup of OCD, distinguished from non-tic related OCD by the type and nature of obsessions and compulsions. Not all persons with Tourette's have ADHD or OCD or other comorbid conditions, although in clinical populations, {{a high percentage of}} patients presenting for care do have ADHD. One author reports that a ten-year overview of patient records revealed about 40% of patients with Tourette's have [...] "TS-only" [...] or [...] "pure TS", referring to Tourette syndrome in the absence of ADHD, OCD and other disorders. Another author reports that 57% of 656 patients presenting with tic disorders had uncomplicated tics, while 43% had tics plus comorbid conditions.

40|$|Functional dysmotility {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{evidence}} of pathology in gastrointestinal tract (GIT). GIT motility regulation is multilevel in nature at the level of central and peripheral nervous system, vegetative nervous system as well as locally directly in the intestinal tract. Gastrointestinal tract microbiota significantly contributes to the local regulation of motility both by forming fecal masses and secreting various metabolites, particularly short chain fatty acids whose composition and number depends on the nutritive factors of microbiota.
