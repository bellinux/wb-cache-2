This paper {{presents the results}} of a study on the effect of heat treatment of preform material on the mechanical properties of the <b>flow</b> <b>formed</b> part and the validity of using empirical relations in predicting the properties of the <b>flow</b> <b>formed</b> components. The strength coefficient K and strain hardening exponent n of equation σ=Kεn are determined from stress–strain curves under different heat treatment conditions for AISI 4130 steel. The effect of cold work on mechanical properties of <b>flow</b> <b>formed</b> part for a given reduction in area (RA) is predicted using empirical relations published in literature. In order to validate the hypothesis of prediction of cold worked material properties after <b>flow</b> <b>forming,</b> a few <b>flow</b> <b>forming</b> experiments are carried out.

As the <b>flow</b> <b>forming</b> is the non linear plastic deformation process, it is required to understand the forces encountered and the strain distributions during the process for the efficient and successful product manufacturing. As it is a non linear plastic deformation process, still the force and strain distribution prediction is quite difficult. So that an attempt is made to predict the forces, stress, strain distributions in the present work, analysis {{has been carried out}} using ABAQUS/Explicit for forward and backward strategies. The work material has been taken as AA 6063 due to its lighter weight, higher formability, ease of availability and versatile applications in aerospace and defense industry. The forces (axial, radial and circumferential) acting during the process have been obtained and reported along with the strain distribution in the length and thickness. It has been found that the axial and radial forces are higher in forward <b>flow</b> <b>forming.</b> The circumferential force is found higher in backward <b>flow</b> <b>forming.</b> Moreover plastic strain distribution along the thickness is found higher in forward <b>flow</b> <b>forming</b> and along length it is found higher in backward <b>flow</b> <b>forming.</b> The study will help to identify suitable strategy before actual production for different material and process conditions...|$|R
