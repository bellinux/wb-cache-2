Anthropometric measurements, serum lipids, blood pressure, and smoking habits were evaluated. In addition, fasting and after glucose-load serum glucose and insulin concentrations were measured. The most significant difference in <b>fibrinogen</b> <b>level</b> was found among the tertiles of fasting serum insulin (F-ANOVA = 4. 5; P < 0. 01) with the highest plasma fibrinogen values in the third insulin tertile, whereas body mass index (BMI), waist/hip circumference ratio (WHR) and serum triglycerides were more weakly related. The current smokers had substantially higher <b>levels</b> of <b>fibrinogen</b> than subjects who never smoked (P < 0. 001).

The compliance of the indication of cryoprecipitate was considered as appropriate if indicated for patients who have hypofibrinogenemia (< 1. 0 g/L) with bleeding, or otherwise inappropriate if pretransfusion <b>fibrinogen</b> <b>level</b> was more than 1. 0 g/L, pretransfusion <b>fibrinogen</b> <b>level</b> was not examined and posttransfusion <b>fibrinogen</b> <b>level</b> more than 1. 5 g/L.

Methods: Preoperative plasma <b>levels</b> of <b>fibrinogen</b> as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were retrospectively examined in 649 patients who underwent surgery for gastric cancer, and the correlation between these factors and nodal status was evaluated. Results: Plasma <b>fibrinogen</b> <b>level</b> in patients with gastric cancer showed a positive association with nodal classification (P 310 mg/dl) as well as high CEA (> 5 ng/ml) and CRP (> 0. 3 mg/dl) {{showed a significant association}} with nodal metastasis in uni-variate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed that hyperfibrinogenemia had an independent association with nodal metastasis (odds ratio, 2. 004 (1. 140 â€“ 3. 521); P = 0. 0157), whereas CEA and CRP were not independent factors. Hyperfibrinogenemia showed an independent associ-ation even in advanced cancer [odds ratio 2. 611 (1. 404 â€“ 4. 854), P = 0. 0024, n = 319].

40|$|Introduction: Fibrinogen, a major {{determinant}} of blood viscosity, is an acute phase protein associated with cardiovascular disease. We studied {{the association of}} hypertension with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding fibrinogen beta chain (FGB). Methods: Three tagging SNPs (rs 1025154, rs 4220 and rs 1044291) were selected from the HapMap database on Han Chinese. Genotypes were determined in 1375 unrelated subjects from the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Study cohort. There were 210 and 372 hypertensive subjects at baseline and at the six-year follow-up, respectively. Results: Among the 3 SNPs, rs 4220 showed an association with hypertension at baseline (ORÂ¼ 1. 49, P Â¼ 0. 004) and at follow-up (ORÂ¼ 1. 28, P Â¼ 0. 024), after adjusting for age, sex, current smoking, drinking and education. This SNP was associated with higher plasma <b>fibrinogen</b> <b>level</b> (bÂ¼ 0. 15, Po 0. 001 at baseline and bÂ¼ 0. 13, Po 0. 001 at follow-up). The association with hypertension remains significant after further adjusting for body mass index and <b>fibrinogen</b> <b>level</b> (ORÂ¼ 1. 43, P Â¼ 0. 014 at baseline; ORÂ¼ 1. 29, PÂ¼ 0. 038 at follow-up). Conclusion: The SNP rs 4220 in FGB, which leads to substitution of arginine by lysine at position 448, is associated with plasma <b>fibrinogen</b> <b>level</b> and hypertension independently in Hong Kong Chinese. This suggests that fibrinogen may be causally linked to hypertension, directly or indirectly, and that elevated <b>fibrinogen</b> <b>level</b> in hypertension is not merely a consequence of elevated blood pressure...|$|R

Methods: An analytic cross-sectional study was undertaken on 261 patients. 131 hospitalized patients were selected from CCU ward,as cases and 130 hospitalized patients from surgery and orthopedic wards of Iran University of Medical Sciences hospitals,as controls.
