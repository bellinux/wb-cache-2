50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>stock</b> sport (also {{known as}} Bavarian Curling) is a winter sport, {{somewhat}} similar to curling. In German, {{it is known}} as Eisstockschießen. Competitors slide <b>ice</b> <b>stocks</b> over an <b>ice</b> surface, aiming for a target, or to cover the longest distance. <b>Ice</b> <b>stocks</b> have a gliding surface, to which a stick (ca 30 cm) is attached. The sport, mostly practised in southern Germany, Austria and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol in Italy, has been demonstrated at the Winter Olympic Games on two occasions. Although the sport is traditionally played on an ice surface, events are also held on tarmac in summer.|$|R

40|$|Marine and rift sediments exert a {{fundamental}} control on ice stream {{flow in the}} West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and hence on its mass balance and stability. In contrast, most ice streams in the much larger <b>East</b> Antarctic <b>Ice</b> Sheet {{are thought to be}} relatively stable features resting on till, perhaps underlain by crystalline rock. Any geological controls on <b>East</b> Antarctic <b>Ice</b> Sheet enhanced flow remain largely unknown. We present aerogeophysical evidence indicating that a region of enhanced ice flow in the interior of the <b>East</b> Antarctic <b>Ice</b> Sheet is underlain by subglacial sediments 3 km thick and that these are influencing the flow regime of the overlying ice. We show that subglacial sediments are important in modulating ice dynamics, not just for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, but also for its much larger neighbor, and suggest that the sedimentary basin identified here may contain information on the Neogene glacial history of this part of the <b>East</b> Antarctic <b>Ice</b> Sheet...|$|R

40|$|The {{harp seal}} Phoca groenlandica {{is the most}} {{abundant}} seal species in the Barents Sea. In order to evaluate the ecological importance of the species, diet studies have recently been carried out at various times of the year. In 1992, {{data were collected from}} seals sampled between the breeding and moulting seasons (March-May). There {{is no doubt that the}} animals feed during this period. From examinations of stomach and intestine contents, harp seals, sampled in the southwestern parts (Varangerfjord, North Norway) of the Barents Sea, appeared to have been feeding intensively on capelin Mallotus villosus. The harp seal diet in the commercial hunting areas north of the White Sea (the <b>East</b> <b>Ice)</b> consisted of prawns Pandalus borealis, capelin, cod Gadus morhua, saithe Pollachius virens, sculpins (Cottidae), snailfish (Liparidae) and long rough dab (Hippoglossoides plattessoides). Feeding in the <b>East</b> <b>Ice</b> area and in the White Sea appeared to have been less intensive than further to the west. In the White Sea the harp seals had been feeding mainly on crustaceans and the fishes sandeels (Ammodytidae), capelin and White Sea herring (Clupea harengus marisalbi) ...|$|R
