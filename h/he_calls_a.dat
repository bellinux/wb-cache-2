5|$|Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) {{believes}} that Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) {{does not know}} about his affair with her husband, but in fact she is playing dumb {{in order to keep}} Oscar off his guard while she makes arrangements to have him killed. She goes to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) for help, without telling him the details, and <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> fellow former volunteer sheriff's deputy named Trevor (Chris Gethard) for assistance. After Trevor shows his credentials, Angela says she wants the target murdered, which Dwight protests is too extreme, so they compromise to breaking the target's kneecaps. Dwight realizes the target is Oscar when Angela angrily crushes a cookie given to her by Oscar. Dwight tries to get Angela to reconsider, but Trevor has already arrived to carry out the job. Dwight rushes to get Oscar out. They run into Trevor outside. A struggle between the three men ensues, with Oscar ultimately managing to take away Trevor's lead pipe. When Trevor runs away, Oscar and Dwight are confronted by Angela, who blames Oscar for turning her husband gay. Oscar says that he was always gay, and refuses to hand the lead pipe over to Angela. She kicks him in the shin instead. Upset that they do not understand homosexuality, Dwight and Angela go to Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein), who is confounded by their outlandish questions over homosexual activity.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} A.J. Styles against Christopher Daniels in a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match. In an Iron Man match, a {{time-limit}} {{is set for}} a particular amount, in this case thirty-minutes. The match will continue until time runs out and the competitor who gained the most falls when time runs out by pinfall, submission, count-out, or disqualification is the overall winner of the bout. Daniels attempted to get Styles to submit early in the bout by using his Koji Clutch submission hold. Later on, Daniels earned a two-count after landing on Styles with his signature B.M.E. aerial maneuver. Styles also gained a near-fall by holding Daniels on his shoulders before twisting him off and slamming him to the mat for what <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> Rack Bomb. With only 13 {{seconds left in the}} match and the score still tied zero to zero, Styles performed his signature Styles Clash maneuver and followed with the pin. As time ran out, Styles had the most falls thus retaining the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
5|$|The tournament final between A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe {{took place}} on August14 at Sacrifice. As Styles laid against the ring ropes at the {{beginning}} of the match, Joe ran across the ring and kicked him in the face, causing him to fly out of the ring and crash down on the floor. Joe followed by diving through the ring ropes and smashing Styles in the face with his forearm as Styles reached his feet. Joe later held Styles in an STF submission hold, which he was forced to release when Styles touched the bottom rope. Styles then gained the advantage with a dropkick and front-flip splash from the ring ropes. He held Joe on his shoulders before twisting him off into a powerbomb, or what <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> Rack Bomb. During the move, referee Andrew Thomas was kicked in the face and knocked unconscious, allowing Daniels to interfere in the contest. Daniels attacked Styles and attempted to hit Joe with the X Division Title belt before Styles threw Daniels from the ring. Joe followed by lifting Styles up and performing his Muscle Buster maneuver, then placing Styles in his Coquina Clutch submission hold. Styles submitted to the move as the referee came to, giving the victory to Joe. The final bout lasted 15 minutes and 15 seconds.|$|E

25|$|Sisko angrily confronts Garak, {{who admits}} he planted a bomb on Vreenak's ship {{in case the}} forgery was not accepted. Garak also admits he killed Tolar {{in order to keep}} his work secret. Garak {{maintains}} that when the Romulans scan the wreckage and find the rod, any imperfections will be attributed to damage from the explosion, and thus the recording will implicate the Dominion as planned. Garak asserts that Sisko included him in the plan {{to do the things that}} Sisko was unwilling to do. Garak also states that Sisko can ease his conscience with the knowledge that the Alpha quadrant may have been saved at the cost of the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal and the self respect of one Starfleet officer, which <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> bargain.|$|E
25|$|In the Livre d'Artus, Merlin enters Rome in {{the form}} of a huge stag with a white fore-foot. He bursts into the {{presence}} of Julius Caesar and tells the emperor that only the wild man of the woods can interpret the dream that has been troubling him. Later, he returns {{in the form}} of a black, shaggy man, barefoot, with a torn coat. In another episode, he decides to do something that will be spoken of forever. Going into the forest of Brocéliande, he transforms himself into a herdsman carrying a club and wearing a wolf-skin and leggings. He is large, bent, black, lean, hairy and old, and his ears hang down to his waist. His head is as big as a buffalo's, his hair is down to his waist, he has a hump on his back, his feet and hands are backwards, he is hideous, and is over 18 feet tall. By his arts, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> herd of deer to come and graze around him.|$|E
25|$|The prize contest begins. Beckmesser {{attempts}} {{to sing the}} verses that he had obtained from Sachs. However, he garbles the words (Morgen ich leuchte) and fails to fit them to an appropriate melody, and ends up singing so clumsily that the crowd laughs him off. Before storming off in anger, he yells that the song was not even his: Hans Sachs tricked him into singing it. The crowd is confused. How could the great Hans Sachs have written such a bad song? Sachs tells them that the song is not his own, and also {{that it is in}} fact a beautiful song which the masters will love when they hear it sung correctly. To prove this, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> witness: Walther. The people are so curious about the song (correctly worded as Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein) that they allow Walther to sing it, and everyone is won over in spite of its novelty.|$|E

25|$|Kant {{proceeds}} to motivate {{the need for}} the special sort of inquiry <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> metaphysics of morals: “That there must be such a philosophy is evident from the common idea of duty and of moral laws.” The moral law must “carry with it absolute necessity.” (4:389) The content and the bindingness of the moral law, in other words, do not vary according to the particularities of agents or their circumstances. Given that the moral law, if it exists, is universal and necessary, the only appropriate means to investigate it is through a priori rational reflection. Thus, a correct theoretical understanding of morality requires a metaphysics of morals. Kant thinks that until we have completed this sort of investigation, “morals themselves are liable to all kinds of corruption” because the “guide and supreme norm for correctly estimating them are missing.” A fully specified account of the moral law will guard against the errors and rationalization to which human moral reasoning is prone. (4:390) The search for the supreme principle of morality—the antidote to confusion in the moral sphere—will occupy Kant for the first two chapters of the Groundwork.|$|E
500|$|He also {{performed}} [...] "Trading Places" [...] on his international OMG Tour, which commenced in November 2010, and concluded in June 2011.

A study published in Science magazine in July 2001 confirmed the low reliability of IACUC reviews of animal experiments.

500|$|The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering was {{published}} in 2000. Here, Finkelstein argues that Elie Wiesel and others exploit {{the memory of the}} Holocaust as an [...] "ideological weapon." [...] The purpose, writes Finkelstein, is to enable the State of Israel, [...] "one of the world's most formidable military powers, with a horrendous human rights record, [...] cast itself as a victim state;" [...] that is, to provide Israel [...] "immunity to criticism." [...] He alleges what <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "double shakedown" [...] by [...] "a repellent gang of plutocrats, hoodlums and hucksters" [...] seeking enormous legal damages and financial settlements from Germany and Switzerland, moneys which then go to the lawyers and institutional actors involved in procuring them, rather than actual Holocaust survivors.|$|E
500|$|Even the novel's {{language}} bridges this divide. Waters often {{employs the}} word [...] "queer" [...] {{to describe the}} unusual or remarkable, instead of its post-1922 connotation to refer to homosexuality. She also uses the term specifically to highlight what is unusual {{as it applies to}} gender, or Nan's own emotions toward Kitty. Nan's father uses the symbol of the oyster, what <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "real queer fish" [...] that exhibits both male and female characteristics, and compares it to Kitty who sits before them in feminine attire though they have seen her on stage dressed as a man. The landlady of the boarding house where Kitty and Nan are staying appraises Nan's first male costume, and is troubled by the [...] "queerness" [...] of it because she looks too much like a man, instead of a woman pretending to be a man. Donna Allegra suggests that by using the contemporary term for prostitutes, [...] "gay girls", Waters is winking at her readers.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Hawass {{threatened}} to ban exhibitions of Egyptian artifacts in Germany if Nefertiti was not lent to Egypt, {{but to no}} avail. Hawass also requested a worldwide boycott of loans to German museums to initiate what <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "scientific war". Hawass wanted Germany to at least lend the bust to Egypt in 2012 {{for the opening of}} the new Grand Egyptian Museum near the Great Pyramids of Giza. Simultaneously, a campaign called [...] "Nefertiti Travels" [...] was launched by cultural association CulturCooperation, based in Hamburg, Germany. They distributed postcards depicting the bust of Nefertiti with the words [...] "Return to Sender" [...] and wrote an open letter to the German Culture Minister, Bernd Neumann, supporting the view that Egypt should be given the bust on loan. In 2009, when Nefertiti moved back to the Neues Museum– her old home, the appropriateness of Berlin as the bust's location was questioned.|$|E

I should have thought that there must be a pretty large number there." [...] High replies that it is true there are a pretty large number of men there, adding many more have yet to arrive, yet that [...] "there will seem too few when the wolf comes." [...] However, High adds that food is not a problem because there will never be too many people in Valhalla that the meat of Sæhrímnir (which <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> boar) cannot sufficiently feed. High says that Sæhrímnir is cooked every day by the cook Andhrímnir in the pot Eldhrimnir, and is again whole every evening. High then quotes the stanza of Grímnismál mentioning the cook, meal, and container in reference.|$|E
500|$|Charlie {{develops}} the model {{needed to find}} the rapist and refines it with graduate student Amita Ramanujan's (Navi Rawat) assistance. Charlie's model yields what <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "hot zone", {{an area in which}} the suspect probably lives. As the case progresses, Silber is found dead in her house. Don and his team resort to comparing DNA samples of men who live in the hot zone to samples of the rapist/killer. Using statistical analysis, Charlie deduces that Silber lied about where her rape took place. After Don learns from Silber's colleagues where Silber was raped, Charlie refines his equation, which yields a smaller area within the original hot zone. DNA, however, clears everyone in the original hot zone. As a result, Assistant Director in Charge (ADIC) Walter Merrick (Anthony Heald) pulls Don and his team from the investigation. At the same time, Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol), Charlie's colleague and friend, encourages Charlie to make his equation [...] "less elegant" [...] and to evaluate the worth of his consultation work.|$|E
500|$|The others discuss {{who shot}} Ron, and Tom creates a minor panic when he {{suggests}} perhaps an outsider is hunting them. Ann takes Leslie aside {{and says she}} knows who shot Ron, {{and a few minutes}} later Leslie admits to the group that she was the shooter, even though Ann knows this is not the case. A park ranger (Jay Johnston) arrives and interrogates Leslie, implying that the accident is the result of her femininity. Leslie knows that she is a good hunter, but goes along with the ranger's sexist implications in order to appease him. Later, a bandaged Ron repeatedly berates Leslie, prompting Ann to insist Tom come forward. Tom admits he shot Ron, and that Leslie covered for him because he did not have his hunting license, which could have resulted in a $25,000 fine and prison time. Ron is impressed with Leslie, whom <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "stand-up guy". The episode ends with a get well party for Ron, where Ann is unimpressed with Andy's hickey, and the whole party is horrified by Ron's head wound.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Cooper's Philip Larkin: Subversive Writer and John Osborne's [...] "Larkin, Ideology and Critical Violence" [...] {{suggest the}} {{changing}} temper of Larkin studies, the latter attacking eminent critics such as James Booth and Anthony Thwaite for their readiness to reduce to poems to works of biography, and stressing instead {{the genius of}} Larkin's universality and deconstructionism. Cooper argues that [...] "The interplay of signs and motifs in the early work orchestrates a subversion of conventional attitudes towards class, gender, authority and sexual relations". Cooper identifies Larkin as a progressive writer, and perceives in the letters a [...] "plea for alternative constructs of masculinity, femininity and social and political organisation". Cooper draws on the entire canon of Larkin's works, {{as well as on}} unpublished correspondence, to counter the image of Larkin as merely a racist, misogynist reactionary. Instead he identifies in Larkin what <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "subversive imagination".

500|$|Presley's ancestry was {{primarily}} a Western European mix that included German, Scots-Irish, Scottish, and some French Norman. Gladys would often tell the family that before the Civil War, her great-great-grandmother, Morning Dove White, was a 'full-blooded Cherokee Indian', although some genealogists doubt the claim. In her book Elvis and Gladys, Elaine Dundy claims that Presley's great-great-grandmother Nancy Burdine Tackett was Jewish, citing a third cousin of Presley's, Oscar Tackett. However, {{there is no evidence}} that the Presley family shared this belief and the syndicated columnist Nate Bloom has challenged the cousin's account, which <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "tall tale". Gladys was regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant member of the small family. Vernon moved from one odd job to the next, evincing little ambition. The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance. The Presleys survived the F5 tornado in the 1936 Tupelo–Gainesville tornado outbreak. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of kiting a check written by the landowner, Orville S. Bean, the dairy farmer and cattle-and-hog broker for whom he then worked. He was jailed for eight months at Parchman Farm (Mississippi State Penitentiary). Gladys and Elvis moved in with relatives.|$|E
500|$|William Poole, in his 2009 {{edition of}} The Man in the Moone, {{provides}} additional {{evidence for a}} later dating. Godwin, he argues, most likely got {{his knowledge of the}} Jesuit mission in China (founded in 1601) from a 1625 edition of Samuel Purchass Purchas his Pilgrimage. This book contains a redaction from Nicolas Trigault's De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu (1615) ("Concerning the Christian expedition to China undertaken by the Society of Jesus"), itself the redaction of a manuscript by the Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci. Poole also sees the influence of Robert Burton, who in the second volume of The Anatomy of Melancholy had speculated on gaining astronomical knowledge through telescopic observation (citing Galileo) or from space travel (Lucian). Appearing {{for the first time in}} the 1628 edition of the Anatomy is a section on planetary periods, which gives a period for Mars of three years– had Godwin used William Gilbert's De Magnete (1600) for this detail he would have found a Martian period of two years. Finally, Poole points to what <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "genetic debt": while details on for instance the Martian period could have come from a few other sources, Burton and Godwin are the only two writers of the time to combine an interest in alien life with the green children of Woolpit, from a 12th-century account of two mysterious green children found in Suffolk.|$|E
