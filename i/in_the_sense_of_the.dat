5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun {{is the subject of a}} finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E

If φ is irreducible, the transition matrix M(f) is irreducible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PerronFrobenius theorem and it has a unique PerronFrobenius eigenvalue λ(f)≥1 which is equal to the spectral radius of M(f).|$|E
30|$|This paper presents, for {{sequences}} of sets, {{the notions of}} asymptotically lacunary statistical equivalence (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Wijsman) of multiplicity L, strongly asymptotically lacunary p-equivalence (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Wijsman) of multiplicity L and strongly Cesàro asymptotically p-equivalence (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Wijsman) of multiplicity L.

30|$|Clearly if a set is {{strongly}} orthogonal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Birkhoff-James, then it {{is strongly}} orthogonal relative to every element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Birkhoff-James. If X has a Hamel basis which is strongly orthogonal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Birkhoff-James, then we call the Hamel basis a strongly orthogonal Hamel basis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Birkhoff-James, and if X has a Hamel basis which is strongly orthogonal relative to an element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Birkhoff-James, then we call the Hamel basis a strongly orthogonal Hamel basis relative to that element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Birkhoff-James.

25|$|As a {{religious}} position, some describe pantheism as the polar opposite of atheism. From this standpoint, pantheism {{is the view}} that everything {{is part of an}} all-encompassing, immanent God. All forms of reality may then be considered either modes of that Being, or identical with it. Some hold that pantheism is a non-religious philosophical position. To them, pantheism is the view that the Universe (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> totality of all existence) and God are identical (implying a denial of the personality and transcendence of God).|$|E
25|$|Malaysia has a {{population}} of just over 27million. As of the 2010 Population and Housing Census, 61.3 percent of the population practices Islam; 19.8 percent Buddhism; 9.2 percent Christianity; 6.3 percent Hinduism; and 1.3 percent traditional Chinese religions. The remainder is accounted for by other faiths, including Animism, Folk religion, Sikhism, Baha'i and other belief systems. However, these figures may be misleading as professing the religion of Islam is a requirement for being a Malay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Malaysian Constitution. Moreover, Muslims who wish to leave Islam face strong disincentives.|$|E
25|$|However, the 19th century saw {{the rise}} of {{dialectology}} and the categorisation of dialects. German dialectologists termed the German varieties spoken in the mountainous south of Germany as Hochdeutsch ("High German"). Subsequently, German varieties spoken in the north were designated as Niederdeutsch ("Low German"). These were in the Dutch language area calqued as the exonyms Nederduits and Hoogduits and referred now to the German varieties of standard German. As a result, the Hoog ("High") was dropped in the Dutch exonym Hoogduits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German standard language, meaning that Duits narrowed down as Dutch exonym for German. Moreover, Nederduits lost its meaning as endonym for Dutch, and Nederlands prevailed as sole Dutch endonym.|$|E

25|$|The basic {{supply and}} demand theory predicts that raising the minimum wage helps workers whose wages are raised, and hurts {{people who are not}} hired (or lose their jobs) when {{companies}} cut back on employment. But proponents of the minimum wage hold that the situation is much more complicated than the basic theory can account for. One complicating factor is possible monopsony in the labor market, whereby the individual employer has some market power in determining wages paid. Thus it is at least theoretically possible that the minimum wage may boost employment when affected employees spend more in other sectors of the economy. Though single employer market power is unlikely to exist in most labor markets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional 'company town,' asymmetric information, imperfect mobility, and the personal element of the labor transaction give some degree of wage-setting power to most firms.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{prediction}} {{of the theory}} is the extreme porosity of matter. As supposed by Fatio and Le Sage in 1690/1758 (and before them, Huygens) matter must consist mostly of empty space so that the very small particles can penetrate the bodies nearly undisturbed and therefore every single part of matter can {{take part in the}} gravitational interaction. This prediction has been (in some respects) confirmed {{over the course of the}} time. Indeed, matter consists mostly of empty space and certain particles like neutrinos can pass through matter nearly unhindered. However, the image of elementary particles as classical entities who interact directly, determined by their shapes and sizes (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> net structure proposed by Fatio/Le Sage and the equisized spheres of Isenkrahe/Darwin), is not consistent with current understanding of elementary particles. The Lorentz/Thomson proposal of electrical charged particles as the basic constituents of matter is inconsistent with current physics as well.|$|E
25|$|A {{legally binding}} {{contract}} occurs when one party makes an offer and receives an acceptance {{from the other}} party. A contract must consist of an offer and acceptance, the intention to create legal relations and consideration all must be present to make the contract legally enforceable. In contract law consideration {{is concerned with the}} bargain of the contract, each party to a contract must be both a promisor and a promisee. They must each receive a benefit and each suffers a detriment. The classic definition of consideration was given by the court in the case of Currie v Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex 153, referred to consideration as consisting of a detriment to the promisee or a benefit to the promisor, Lush J: “A valuable consideration, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law, may consist either in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered or undertaken by the other".|$|E

25|$|A {{section of}} the Central Asian Scythians (under Sai-Wang) {{is said to have}} taken southerly {{direction}} and after passing through the Pamirs it entered the Chipin or Kipin after crossing the Hasuna-tu (Hanging Pass) located above the valley of Kanda in Swat country. Chipin has been identified by Pelliot, Bagchi, Raychaudhury and some others with Kashmir while other scholars identify it with Kapisha (Kafirstan). The Sai-Wang had established his kingdom in Kipin. S. Konow interprets the Sai-Wang as Saka Murunda of Indian literature, Murunda being equal to Wang i.e. king, master or lord, but Bagchi who takes the word Wang <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king of the Scythians but he distinguishes the Sai Sakas from the Murunda Sakas. There are reasons to believe that Sai Scythians were Kamboja Scythians and therefore Sai-Wang belonged to the Scythianised Kambojas (i.e. Parama-Kambojas) of the Transoxiana region and came back to settle among his own stock after being evicted from his ancestral land located in Scythia or Shakadvipa. King Moga or Maues could have belonged to this group of Scythians who had migrated from the Sai country (Central Asia) to Chipin.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Barth, liberalism, and fundamentalism {{goes far beyond}} the issue of inerrancy, however. From Barth's perspective, liberalism, as understood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century with Friedrich Schleiermacher and Hegel as its leading exponents and not necessarily expressed in any particular political ideology, is the divinization of human thinking. This, to him, inevitably leads one or more philosophical concepts to become the false God, thus attempting to block the true voice of the living God. This, in turn, leads to the captivity of theology by human ideology. In Barth's theology, he emphasizes {{again and again that}} human concepts of any kind, breadth or narrowness quite beside the point, can never be considered as identical to God's revelation. In this aspect, Scripture is also written human language, which bears witness to the self-revelation of God in Jesus Christ. Scripture cannot be considered as identical to God's self-revelation, which is properly only Jesus Christ. However, in his freedom and love, God truly reveals himself through human language and concepts, with a view toward their necessity in reaching fallen humanity. Thus Barth claims that Christ is truly presented in Scripture and the preaching of the church, echoing a stand expressed in his native Swiss Reformed Church's Helvetic Confession of the 16th century.|$|E
