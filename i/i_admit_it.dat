500|$|Tim's driving days {{started as}} a toddler when {{he was given a}} go-kart that he often drove inside {{buildings}} and across his lawn. He later raced the kart at tracks in Moreland and New Pittsburg. Richmond grew up in a well-to-do family, and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates, so his parents enrolled him in Miami Military Academy in Miami, Florida. During his years in Miami, Tim and his mother moved to Florida and his father stayed in Ohio. While home in Ohio over a summer break, he met local drag racer Raymond Beadle through lifelong friend Fred Miller. When Richmond reached age 16, his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am, a speedboat and a Piper Cherokee airplane for his birthday. Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about spoiling her only son. She once said, [...] "Tim was lazy...", and [...] "... I did everything for him. I ruined him, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it.</b> He was my whole life." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} was photographed by Björk's former boyfriend, the French {{director}} Stéphane Sednaoui. It shows the singer {{standing in a}} London street, her pale skin and dark hair contrasting with the vivid colours of the Japanese-inspired signs behind her. An earlier shoot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino was scrapped; it would later appear in a 1995 article for The Face, in which Björk explained: [...] "It cost £24,000. But now I know what I want. OK, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it,</b> [...] I'm a pop star"! In the original cover picture, Björk was surrounded by silver balls, but she scrapped the cover in favour of something [...] "more poppy". Designer Paul White of Me Company—who had been a frequent collaborator since The Sugarcubes—"surrounded her with giant postcards to represent communication with friends and family". Me Company designed the artwork, while Martin Gardiner modelled the lotus flower used in the album's booklet and packaging. The jacket Björk wears, shown on the cover, was inspired by Royal Mail airmail envelopes, referencing the album's title. It was specially crafted from envelope paper called Tyvek by designer Hussein Chalayan. Björk {{was a friend of}} Chalayan and an admirer of his designs, modelling for him in September 1995. The jacket is displayed under glass at Hard Rock Reykjavík, and was part of a 2015 MoMA retrospective on the singer, titled Björk. Vice has identified the airmail jacket look as one the [...] "ultimate fashion moments" [...] of Björk's career.|$|E

No. So, as far as my {{conscience}} and my mission were concerned, there was no problem. This needs to be clarified...My experience was the same as that of my movement. We were new and inexperienced and events kept occurring one after the other which we had to deal with. In doing that, we made mistakes as I told you. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> now and I admitted it in the notes I have written. Whoever wishes to blame or attack me is entitled to do so. I regret I didn't have enough experience to totally control the movement. On the other hand, with our constant struggle, this had to be done together with others in the communist world to stop Kampuchea becoming Vietnamese. For the love of the nation and the people it was the right thing to do but in the course of our actions we made mistakes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Are {{you going}} to speak in the tows hall to-night?" [...] the boy demanded. <b>I</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>it.</b> He went off, pausing once to stare back at me.... Maude and I walked on.|$|R
60|$|MENDOZA. Quite so. It {{has reached}} us, <b>I</b> <b>admit.</b> <b>It</b> {{is in the}} air of the century.|$|E

6000|$|... "Life's a {{difficult}} problem, Veronica," [...] I allowed. [...] "Things {{are not as}} they ought to be, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it.</b> But one must not despair. Something's got to be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Dane dryly, [...] "as <b>I</b> <b>admitted,</b> <b>it</b> {{appeared}} somewhat out of {{your usual}} line, but when I heard that {{a man from the}} settlement had been ejected with violence from your homestead, what could one believe?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{idea was}} that the sale would be an extra attraction," [...] Gerald went on. [...] "Still, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it's</b> hard for you, because you hate chapels {{and will have to}} bid. In fact, you'll, no doubt, have to buy the sheep at a sentimental price and sell them at their value." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>it.</b> She didn't say a word. And {{somehow she}} {{did it in a}} way that made it worse than if she had spoken for hours. Somehow it was brought home to me that she didn't like Englishmen, and that if she had had to meet an Englishman, I was the one she'd have chosen last.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{energy of}} thought {{it is not}} necessary," [...] said Dr. Martineau, and {{considered}} for a time. [...] "Yet--certainly--I am not a man of action. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it.</b> I make few decisions." ...|$|E
60|$|LORD LOAM (seeing the {{opportunity}} for a diversion). <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> frankly. I abandon them. Emily, as the result of our experiences on the island, I think of going over to the Tories.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{that moment}} the fool of a {{policeman}} came up {{and wanted to know}} what the matter was. I lost my head. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> freely. The policeman grasped my shoulder, and I struck him." ...|$|E
60|$|GILBERT. I am {{not quite}} sure. Perhaps <b>I</b> may <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> after supper. There {{is a subtle}} {{influence}} in supper.|$|R

6000|$|... "I am to be envied; <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> with gratitude." [...] Graham glanced half wistfully {{at a map}} on the table. [...] "For all that, I {{remember}} the wide spaces up yonder now and then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you find}} the {{accommodation}} of the car insufficient," [...] said Sir Richmond {{in a tone of}} extreme reasonableness, and <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> is, we can easily hire a larger car in a place like this.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have it in}} {{your power}} {{to make it more}} {{profitable}} always for me to keep faith with you. It is due to you that we have done so well in Guichen. Oh, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> frankly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it's</b> getting rather late in {{the evening}} for pure {{philosophical}} inquiry, and you are tired. Practically, then, it WAS wise to let them get away before they discovered two things. One, our exact relations here with these women; and the other, HOW MANY of us were here. At present they think we are three or four in possession and with the consent of the women." ...|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Brumley {{was moved}} by a ridiculous impulse, which he just succeeded in suppressing, to say to Mrs. Sawbridge, [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> looks very well. But the {{essential}} point, you know, is that it isn't so...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} {{you as much as}} this," [...] she continued. [...] "There is a secret. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it.</b> Set {{yourself}} to find it out, if you will--but if you do, never dare to call yourself my friend again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good lord! what an argument," [...] {{he exclaimed}} and relapsed into silence. Had he been {{accustomed}} to natives and their ways he would have understood the point much better than he did, though <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> is difficult to explain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perfectly. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> the {{existence}} of the article and <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>it</b> was written with all the vigour I could command, on the lines quoted by Miller. Since, however, it was never published, it can surely be treated as nonexistent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ('I {{shall be}} beaten by this Lawyer,' Mrs Lammle gaily whispered to Mrs Boffin. 'I am afraid <b>I</b> must <b>admit</b> <b>it,</b> if he presses me, for it's damagingly true.') ...|$|R

60|$|FANNY [laughs]. It doesn't come off, does it, Vernon, dear? [Vernon laughs. The two ladies, laughing, kiss her.] I'm so {{glad you}} think I'm pretty. As a matter of fact, I'm not. There's a certain charm about me, <b>I</b> <b>admit.</b> <b>It</b> deceives people.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was," [...] she agreed, hoarsely. [...] "Can't {{you see it}} in my face? I do {{not always}} look like a woman of forty. Can't you see the gray shadows that are there? You see, <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> frankly. I was terrified--I am terrified!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait!" [...] she begged, [...] "oh, wait! Listen! I am in your power. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it.</b> I {{will make}} terms. I will sign anything. What {{is it that}} you want? You shall be rich, but you must go away. You must leave me now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Besides, Aaron," [...] said Lilly, {{drinking}} {{his last}} sip of wine, [...] "what {{do you care}} whether you see me again or not? What do you care whether you see anybody again or not? You want to be amused. And now you're irritated because you think I {{am not going to}} amuse you any more: and you don't know who is going to amuse you. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> <b>it's</b> a dilemma. But it's a hedonistic dilemma of the commonest sort." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>admitted</b> that <b>it</b> was, but I {{thought to}} myself that a good supper and a bed would be better, for I was awfully tired and hungry. But I didn't say this.|$|R
