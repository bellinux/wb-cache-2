The <b>fruits</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>processed</b> <b>are</b> evaluated {{on the basis of}} important technological quality parameters, such as the content of dry matter and organic acids. Recently, among important qualitative characteristics of fruits has been included colorant content, especially lycopene. Aim of this study <b>was</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the quality of selected tomato varieties for industrial processing. Tested were varieties Uno Rosso, San Marzano 4, Brixol, Strombolino, UG. 8168, Diana and Nemarock cultivated in very hot and dry agro-climatic region. The dry matter content was determined by the gravimetric method, the content of organic acid by titration and the content of colorants spectrophotometrically. The dry matter content of the samples ranged from 4. 65 % (Nemarock) to 5. 93 % (San Marzano 4). Content of organic acids ranged from 0. 33 % (Nemarock) to 0. 59 % (Strombolino), content of carotenoids in tomato samples ranged from 111. 288 mg. 100 g- 1 DM (Nemarock) to 198. 365 mg. 100 g- 1 DM (San Marzano 4). Lycopene was present in the amount of 99. 438 mg. 100 g- 1 DM (Nemarock) to 192. 687 mg. 100 g- 1 DM (San Marzano 4).

Por outro lado, há alta perecibilidade dos frutos e a colheita ainda é predominantemente manual. Um modelo matemático foi desenvolvido com o propósito de entender objetivamente o processo de suprimento de tomate e, também, vislumbrar possibilidades de sua otimização. A simulação a partir do modelo pode gerar cenários que, quando comparados com o desempenho efetivamente observado em campo, evidenciam a importância da gestão acurada, com a presença de potenciais ganhos financeiros expressivos na cadeia de suprimentos a partir da redução de tempos, perdas e custos. As perdas de produto poderiam ser reduzidas de mais de 2 % para algo inferior a 1 %. A menor capacidade ociosa traduzir-se-ia em um menor custo de oportunidade e aumento de receita. Para uma fábrica com um consumo de tomates de 336 mil toneladas por ano, a melhoria no suprimento de matéria-prima poderia resultar em ganhos estimados em R$ 6 milhões por ano.

While the majority of local actors are actors who sell at the Market Projo such as market traders and retailers. With the presence of nonlocal actors illustrates that commodity in a commodity market Projo nonlocal. Nonlocal vegetables are from Sub Getasan and District Ngablak. Then for for commodities originating from the center of fruit like Batu in  East Java, Malang, Banyuwangi, and Kediri, while for centers such as Magelang, Central Java and Kebumen.

Five irrigation treatments, ranging from moderate to severe water restriction, were applied: (i) full irrigation (FI), irrigated to satisfy the maximum crop water requirements (ETc); (ii) regulated deficit irrigation (RDI), receiving 50 % of ETc during the kernel-filling stage and at 100 % ETc throughout the remaining periods; and three PRD treatments - PRD 70, PRD 50 and PRD 30 - irrigated at 70 %, 50 % and 30 % ETc, respectively, during the whole growth season. The DI treatments did not affect the overall fruit growth pattern compared to the FI treatment, but they had a negative impact on the final kernel dry weight for the most stressed treatments.
