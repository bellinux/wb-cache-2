Also in May, details were shared on a three issue tie-in series titled Civil War II: Ulysses from writer Al Ewing and artist Jefte Palo. The series focuses on Ulysses, the new Inhuman {{with the power}} to predict the future at the center of [...] "Civil War II". Ewing described the series as [...] "a prequel of sorts", explaining, [...] "we're following Ulysses as he's taken to the Tower of Wisdom -- a sort of Inhuman temple of learning, <b>for</b> <b>want</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> term -- to be trained by Karnak, whose Inhuman ability is to see the flaw in all things. Karnak's training methods might be more than Ulysses can handle, though." [...] The next month, Alonso said [...] "Civil War II" [...] would set a new status quo in the Marvel Universe, which would be presented in the [...] "Divided We Stand" [...] storyline as part of the company's 2016 Marvel NOW! relaunch.|$|E

After some historical notes on the first attempts for the numerical evaluation of LCEs, we discuss in detail the multiplicative ergodic theorem of Oseledec [102], which pro-vides the theoretical basis for the computation of the LCEs. Then, we analyze the algorithm for the computation of the maximal LCE, whose value has been exten-sively used as <b>an</b> indicator <b>of</b> chaos, and the algorithm of the so-called standard method, developed by Benettin et al. [14], for the computation of many LCEs. We also consider different discrete and continuous methods for computing the LCEs based on the QR or the singular value decomposition techniques. Although we are mainly interested in finite-dimensional conservative systems, i. e., autonomous Hamiltonian systems and symplectic maps, we also briefly refer to the evaluation of LCEs of dissipative systems and time series. The relation of two chaos detection techniques, namely the fast Lyapunov indicator (FLI) and the generalized alignment index (GALI), to the computation of the LCEs is also discussed...|$|R
