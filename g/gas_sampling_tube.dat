Ammonia and water vapor are trapped simultaneously in a <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>tube</b> cooled in liquid nitrogen.

Below-ground <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>tubes</b> were also used to measure soil methane (CH 4) concentrations. CH 4 efflux from grazed and un-grazed salt marsh {{did not differ significantly}} although grazing did lead to ‘hotspots’ of underground CH 4 (up to 6 % of total air volume) and CH 4 efflux (peak of 9 mg m− 2 h− 1) significantly linked to high soil moisture content, low soil temperatures and the presence of Juncus gerardii. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) efflux was greater from the un-grazed marsh (mean of 420 mg m− 2 h− 1) than the grazed marsh (mean of 333 mg m− 2 h− 1) throughout most of the year and was positively correlated with the deeper water table and greater soil temperatures. Grazing was not a significant predictor of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) soil emissions. Global Warming Potential (GWP; over 100 years), calculated from mean yearly chamber fluxes for CH 4 and CO 2, did not differ significantly with grazing treatment.

40|$|A {{tube bundle}} system (TBS) is a {{mechanical}} system for continuously drawing <b>gas</b> <b>samples</b> through <b>tubes</b> from multiple monitoring points {{located in an}} underground coal mine. The <b>gas</b> <b>samples</b> are drawn via vacuum pump {{to the surface and}} are typically analyzed for oxygen, methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Results of the gas analyses are displayed and recorded for further analysis. Trends in the composition of the mine atmosphere, such as increasing methane or carbon monoxide concentration, can be detected early, permitting rapid intervention that prevents problems, such as a potentially explosive atmosphere behind seals, fire or spontaneous combustion. TBS is a well-developed technology and has been used in coal mines around the world for more than 50 years. Most longwall coal mines in Australia deploy a TBS, usually with 30 to 40 monitoring points as part of their atmospheric monitoring. The primary uses of a TBS are detecting spontaneous combustion and maintaining sealed areas inert. The TBS might also provide mine atmosphere gas composition data after a catastrophe occurs in an underground mine, if the <b>sampling</b> <b>tubes</b> are not damaged. TBSs are not an alternative to statutory gas and ventilation airflow monitoring by electronic sensors or people; rather, they are an option to consider in an overall mine atmosphere monitoring strategy. This paper describes the hardware, software and operation of a TBS and presents one example of typical data from a longwall coal mine.

A number of biomedical research facilities are located at The University of Queensland, Australia, where researchers and animal handlers are potentially exposed to waste isoflurane gas.

40|$|A {{tube bundle}} system (TBS) is a {{mechanical}} system for continuously drawing <b>gas</b> <b>samples</b> through <b>tubes</b> from multiple monitoring points {{located in an}} underground coal mine for analysis and display on the surface. The U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), in collaboration with Signal Peak Energy (SPE), LLC, Bull Mountains No. 1 Mine, operated a TBS during mining of two bleederless, longwall panels. This paper describes the gas analysis data and its interpretation. As verified by the TBS, coal at the SPE mine tends to oxidize slowly. It was known that a reservoir of low-oxygen concentration atmosphere developed about 610 m (2, 000 ft) behind the longwall face. A bleederless ventilation system facilitates formation of an inert atmosphere in this longwall gob and decreases the likelihood of spontaneous combustion. Connections of the mine atmosphere to the surface through subsidence cracks could allow airflow into the longwall gob, revive coal oxidation and increase spontaneous combustion risk. The atmospheric composition of the sealed areas was homogeneous, except {{in the immediate vicinity}} of suspected ingassing points. The TBS verified that gases within the partially sealed, bleederless longwall gob expanded into the longwall tailgate area when barometric pressure decreased. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the back return airflow at the longwall tailgate was observed to increase by a factor of three and possibly up to 10 times the typical background concentration of 0. 5 to 1. 0 %, {{depending on the size of}} the longwall gob and the magnitude of barometric pressure decrease. TBS have the inherent disadvantage of slow response time due to travel time of the <b>gas</b> <b>samples</b> and sequential <b>gas</b> analyses. A TBS or similar continuous monitoring system could be beneficial in detecting and providing warning of potentially hazardous gas concentrations, if the slow response time of the system is always understood.

40|$|Coastal grasslands, such as salt {{marshes and}} sand dunes, provide many {{important}} ecosystem services including ‘supporting services’ (soil formation, primary productivity and nutrient cycling), ‘provisioning services’ (fresh water supply, food and fibre products, bio-chemical or genetic resources), ‘regulating services’ (equable climate, pollution control, flood prevention, invertebrate pollination and pest regulation) and ‘cultural services’ (recreation, education and aesthetic appreciation). Historically, salt marsh and sand dune grasslands {{were commonly used}} as agricultural livestock grazing land. Currently, some of these coastal grasslands are ‘conservation grazed’ (i. e. extensively grazed to maximise plant diversity {{and to provide a}} suitable habitat for over-wintering bird species), others have been ‘abandoned’ (i. e. large herbivores removed) due to the removal of agricultural subsidies or remain historically ‘un-grazed’. Grazing management of coastal grasslands influences biological and physical habitat characteristics, ecosystem function, biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery. Understanding the impact of grazing is therefore vital to enable future robust management recommendations. Biodiversity is often used as an indicator of ecosystem health and ecosystem service provision with conservation priorities allocated accordingly. It is therefore essential to critically assess just how important biodiversity is to the provision of ecosystem services within a wide range of habitats. The review chapter draws together evidence for this argument from salt marsh and sand dune habitats with the conclusion that functional diversity and composition are more important than biodiversity per se (Chapter 2). The experimental chapters of this thesis deal with the impact of grazing upon temperate salt marsh and sand dune grassland biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. ‘Grazed’ (cattle grazed < 8 cm) and historically ‘un-grazed’ upper salt marsh plots were compared. ‘Fully grazed’ (ponies 0. 2 ha- 1, cattle 0. 05 ha- 1 and rabbits 45 ha- 1), ‘rabbit grazed’ and ‘un-grazed’ (for 8 years) fixed sand dune grassland plots were also evaluated. Firstly, how grazing management affected ecosystem service provision of sand dune grassland was examined, by measuring a wide range of biophysical variables as proxies for ecosystem services (Chapter 3). ‘Supporting’ and ‘regulating’ services were provided predominantly by the un-grazed, ‘provisioning’ and ‘cultural’ services by the extensively grazed grassland. Secondly, the impact of short sward cattle grazing on the abundance, composition and diversity of the ground dwelling invertebrate community of an upper salt marsh was assessed using pitfall traps (Chapter 4). The findings showed that both cattle grazed and un-grazed saltmarsh habitat should be maintained to maximise invertebrate abundance and diversity and provide suitable habitat for coastal specialists. Thirdly, greenhouse gas emissions from grazed and un-grazed salt marsh were measured monthly for one year. Additionally, below-ground <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>tubes</b> were used to measure soil methane concentrations (Chapter 5). Carbon dioxide efflux was greater from the un-grazed marsh soil but ‘hotspots’ of methane efflux were only found on the grazed marsh. Finally, the influence of grazing on the soil microbial community of both salt marsh and sand dune grasslands was measured by microbial biomass (fatty acid phospholipids: PLFAs), bacterial growth rate (Leucine incorporation) and respiration rates (Chapter 6). Microbial biomass, PLFA markers and bacterial growth rate were all influenced by grazing management. In summary, this work concludes that grazing management clearly affects biological and physical habitat characteristics, biodiversity, ecosystem function and ecosystem service delivery (Chapter 7). Management of coastal grasslands evidently involves trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and multiple ecosystem service provision...|$|R
