Charges against Achille Onorato, the owner of NAVARMA, and Agip Abruzzo commander Renato Superina were dropped.|$|R

40|$|<b>Culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> is the {{unlawful}} negligent {{killing of}} a fellow human being. As such it is in many respects a 'residual' crime being the verdict prosecutors may expect when {{they are unable to}} prove the intention to kill when prosecuting for murder. A feature of this was that in the past when defences such as, for instance, intoxication or provocation were raised at murder trials, convictions of <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> were almost automatic. In recent years, {{under the influence of the}} 'purist' current in our Criminal law, intoxication has become a defence to <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> and provocation resulting in loss of self-control has also become a defence to <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide.</b> These developments are unacceptable to some writers on criminal law and a move away from the purist approach to the 'traditional' or pragmatic approach is to be expected. Greater emphasis will be placed on practical results than on the achievement of logical consistency. This could result in the law of <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> becoming more socially effective than it is at present. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>CULPABLE</b> <b>HOMICIDE</b> Selected {{aspects of}} {{investigation}} and legal qualification of <b>culpable</b> <b>homicides</b> in the Czech Republic and Slovakia The presented Master's degree thesis deals with the topic of <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide,</b> as defined in the newly re-codified Czech and Slovak Penal Codes, and interpreted by the Czech and Slovak criminal law doctrine. Selected aspects of homicide investigation are also discussed, with the aim at the significant impact of the immediate crime scene and deceased victim's body inspections on the legal qualification of an act of homicide. Theoretical discussion is furthered with case analyses. Chapter One examines the newly adopted Czech and Slovak legislation concerning the classification of crimes punishing homicide. Both doctrines divide the act of <b>culpable</b> <b>homicide</b> in the two possible groups according to the offender's state of mind affecting the criminal conduct: wilful and negligent homicide. The new Czech Penal Code recognizes the crime of murder as wilful homicide, with more severely punishable sub-category of premeditated murder, and privileged sub-category of infanticide; and the crime of manslaughter, which is also wilful homicide, but committed under certain mitigating circumstances. Negligent homicide {{can be considered as}} the qualified crime of battery resulting in [...] ...|$|R
