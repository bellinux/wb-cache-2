40|$|This {{report was}} {{presented}} at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference. Within organic systems, the successful management of nutrients at the field level is crucial for maximising production and minimising the environmental impacts. This requires that the farmer makes the best possible use of nutrients excreted by the grazing or <b>housed</b> <b>livestock.</b> In addition, the farmer must successfully manage the nutrients built-up in the ley phase of the crop rotation over the whole of the arable phase period. To analyse these complex flows, a nutrient budget model has been developed that describes the spatial and temporal flows within the organic farming system. The concept is analogous to treating nutrients as a currency where the flow of nutrients represents a cashflow. A spatial nutrient budget permits the analyses of the performance of the nutrient flows to be examined for the housing, manure, livestock, rotational land and permanent pasture to be analysed separately. This analysis will allow the farmer to better understand the weaknesses in the system, and hence take preventative measures...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects on}} intake of water {{availability}} and urea addition to rations based on molassed natural pasture hay and dry cowpea haulm were measured using 6 mature castrated male Zebu cattle of 343 kg mean iveweight, {{in an experiment}} carried out {{during the dry season}} in the semi-arid zone of central Mali. The trial was executed and analysed in in which each animal was subject to each of 6 treatments, successively over 6 feeding periods, each of 10 days' duration, throughout which the animals were tied in stalls under shade and fed and watered individually. Natural pasture hay comprising predominantly Pennisetum pedicellatum was fed ad libitum in mixture with 40 percent molasses, with and without addition of urea. Cowpea haulm was fed as a supplement to both diets. Feeding treatments were combined factorially with levels of water allowance. The limited impact of water restriction on feed intake suggests that shortage of drinking water may have a smaller effect on productivity of <b>housed</b> <b>livestock</b> than has been feared, and is an effect which may be compensated for, in the short-term at least by an increase in diet quality...|$|E
40|$|Appropriate {{housing that}} {{promotes}} excellent health and high welfare for different livestock species {{is an essential}} aspect of sustainable animal production. The appropriate design of livestock buildings is a fast changing and ever improving professional endeavour. This book is set out to review the 'current best practice management' in relation to all key design elements of livestock buildings. It is important to manage these buildings correctly to generate environmental conditions that will enhance the health and welfare of livestock, the health of farm workers and people living near farming operations. 'Livestock housing' is written {{for all those who}} are involved in managing the health and welfare conditions of <b>housed</b> <b>livestock</b> on commercial farms, including farm workers, animal scientists, veterinarians, agricultural engineers and of course students. Contributions have been solicited from highly respected specialists from around the world. All key areas of housing management are reviewed, including feeding, watering, ventilation and waste management systems. Furthermore, issues such as the control of emissions, role of bedding, maintenance of hygiene, the management of thermal and aerial environment as well as the use of modern technological tools in the service of livestock management are discussed. This book provides a unique forum for leading international experts to convey up-to-date information to professionals involved in modern animal production. ...|$|E

40|$|Published by NZAEI {{on behalf}} of New Zealand Agricultural Engineering Institute, Pork Industry Council Board, Dairy Division, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Agricultural waste {{management}} is a rapidly changing technology. It is subject to government regulation and sensitive to population growth patterns, community attitudes and land use changes. It is influenced by variables such as soil type, topography, climate, crop and livestock production practices. The trend towards larger and more concentrated livestock operations has accentuated the problems of waste management. This has necessitated better management methods, not only to hold down labour requirements and cost, but also to minimise {{detrimental effects on the}} environment. Agricultural waste management, and particularly that related to <b>housed</b> <b>livestock,</b> became a topic of considerable importance to farmers, their advisers and related authorities in New Zealand in the 1960 s and 1970 s. The passing of the Water and Soil Conservation Act 1967 gave statutory expression to public concern about pollution of natural water, among other concerns. In the late 1970 s, a Dairy Wastes Advisory Committee was meeting {{under the auspices of the}} Dairy Division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and a Piggery Wastes Committee was working with similar aims under the auspices of the then Pork Industry Council. Members of both committees were concerned at the lack of published, authoritative information in New Zealand related to planning, design and management for agricultural wastes. This manual has been written: "to provide authoritative information for competent designers of animal waste management systems"...|$|E
40|$|The main {{impetus for}} 'modern' {{intensive}} animal production occurred after the Second World War, when Western governments developed policies {{to increase the}} availability of cheap, safe food for their populations. Livestock benefit under intensive husbandry by protection from environmental extremes and predators, and better nutritional and health management. Nevertheless, there are costs to the animal, such as impaired social behaviour, limited choice of living environment or pen mates, poor environmental stimulation and behavioural restrictions. The rapid progress in genetic selection of production traits has also, in some cases, adversely affected welfare by creating anatomical and metabolic problems. Above all, the intensively housed animal is heavily reliant on the stockperson and, therefore, inadequate care and husbandry practices by the stockperson may be the largest welfare risk. In {{a future in which}} the food supply may be limited as the world's population grows and land availability shrinks, intensive animal production is likely to expand. At the same time, ethical considerations surrounding intensive farming practices may also become more prominent. Novel technologies provide the opportunity to enhance both the productivity and welfare of intensively kept animals. Developing countries are also establishing more intensive commercial systems to meet their growing need for animal protein. Intensive livestock production in such countries has the potential for major expansion, particularly if such developments address the key constraints of poor welfare, inadequate nutrition, poor reproduction, poor housing, and high mortality often seen with traditional systems, and if farmer access to emerging market opportunities is improved. However, as shown by previous experience, inadequate regulation and staff who lack the appropriate training to care for the welfare of intensively <b>housed</b> <b>livestock</b> can be major challenges to overcome.

40|$|Most (ca. 86 %) Irish farms {{make some}} silage. Besides {{directly}} providing feed for livestock, {{the provision of}} grass silage within integrated grassland systems makes an important positive contribution to effective grazing management and improved forage utilisation by grazing animals, and to effective feed budgeting by farmers. It can also contribute to maintaining the content of desirable species in pastures, and to livestock not succumbing to parasites at sensitive times of the year. Furthermore, the optimal recycling of nutrients collected from <b>housed</b> <b>livestock</b> can often be best achieved by spreading the manures on the land used for producing the conserved feed. On most Irish farms, grass silage will remain the main conserved forage for feeding to livestock during winter for the foreseeable future. However, on some farms high yields of whole-crop (i. e. grain + straw) cereals such as wheat, barley and triticale, and of forage maize, will be an alternative option provided that losses during harvesting, storage and feedout are minimised and that input costs are restrained. These alternative forages {{have the potential to}} reliably support high levels of animal performance while avoiding the production of effluent. Their production and use however will need to advantageously integrate into ruminant production systems. A range of technologies can be employed for crop production and conservation, and for beef production, and the optimal options need to be identified. Beef cattle being finished indoors are offered concentrate feedstuffs at rates that range from modest inputs through to ad libitum access. Such concentrates frequently contain high levels of cereals such as barley or wheat. These cereals are generally between 14 % to 18 % moisture content and tend to be rolled shortly before being included in coarse rations or are more finely processed prior to pelleting. Farmers thinking of using ‘high-moisture grain’ techniques for preserving and processing cereal grains destined for feeding to beef cattle need to know how the yield, conservation efficiency and feeding value of such grains compares with grains conserved using more conventional techniques. European Union policy strongly encourages a sustainable and multifunctional agriculture. Therefore, in addition to providing European consumers with quality food produced within approved systems, agriculture must also contribute positively to the conservation of natural resources and the upkeep of the rural landscape. Plastics are widely used in agriculture and their post-use fate on farms must not harm the environment - they must be managed to support the enduring sustainability of farming systems. There is an absence of information on the efficacy of some new options for covering and sealing silage with plastic sheeting and tyres, and an absence of an inventory of the use, re-use and post-use fate of plastic film on farms. Irish cattle farmers operate a large number of beef production systems, half of which use dairy bred calves. In the current, continuously changing production and market conditions, new beef systems must be considered. A computer package is required that will allow the rapid, repeatable simulation and assessment of alternate beef production systems using appropriate, standardised procedures. There is thus a need to construct, evaluate and utilise computer models of components of beef production systems and to develop mathematical relationships to link system components into a network that would support their integration into an optimal system model. This will provide a framework to integrate physical and financial on-farm conditions with models for estimating feed supply and animal growth patterns. Cash flow and profit/loss results will be developed. This will help identify optimal systems, indicate the cause of failure of imperfect systems and identify areas where applied research data are currently lacking, or more basic research is required.
