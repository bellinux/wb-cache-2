5|$|The nearest tube {{stations}} are Green Park in Piccadilly, and Bond Street station in Oxford Street. Despite its name, Bond Street station <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> connect to either New or Old Bond Street. No buses use the street, although the C2 service crosses New Bond Street. Part of New Bond Street is numbered B406 but the remainder {{and all of}} Old Bond Street is unclassified. New Bond Street is pedestrianised between Grafton Street and Clifford Street to prevent through traffic and to stop the road {{being used as a}} rat run.|$|E
5|$|Although B. rufimanus <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> affect {{faba bean}} yield, it alters the {{aesthetic}} {{quality of the}} seeds {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for seeds targeting market for human consumption. Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed in the lab, but no difference observed in the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E

5|$|City {{status in}} Ireland is decided by {{legislative}} or royal charter. Dublin, with over 1 million {{residents in the}} Greater Dublin Area, is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern Ireland. City status <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> equate with population size. For example, Armagh, with 14,590 is {{the seat of the}} Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland and was re-granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 (having lost that status in local government reforms of 1840). In the Republic of Ireland, Kilkenny, seat of the Butler dynasty, while no longer a city for administrative purposes (since the 2001 Local Government Act), is entitled by law to continue to use the description.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{wanted to}} include iconic {{aspects of the}} Batman mythos, and decided early on in production to have Conroy, Hamill, and Sorkin reprise their roles in Dini's Batman: The Animated Series as Batman, the Joker, and Harley Quinn, respectively. Hamill has thousands of lines of dialogue in the game, and Conroy has relatively few in comparison. After seeing character models of the Joker's Arkham Asylum appearance, Hamill decided to portray the character as dark and gritty while retaining a clownish and playful nature. Although the game features references to plot events in both The Animated Series and Batman comics, the story <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> follow any singular story or depiction of the character.|$|E
5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check the {{appreciation}} of its currency, must work within {{the constraints of the}} prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their central banks. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with market forces largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if it sells its own currency to buy other currencies then this will cause the value of its own currency to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, quantitative easing (common in 2009 and 2010), tends to lead to a fall {{in the value of the}} currency even if the central bank <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> buy any foreign assets.|$|E

5|$|Behavioral ecologists {{have found}} {{its role as}} a brood {{parasite}} to be of particular interest as, unlike many brood parasites, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> oviposit in the hosts' nests. The P. rebeli parasitizes the colony ant species Myrmica schencki as a larva by using chemical mimicry to trick the ants into believing that they are ant larvae; thus, the ants bring the P. rebeli larvae back to their own nests and feed them. It also parasitizes the food plant Gentiana cruciata early in its life cycle, but in turn, is parasitized by the Ichneumon eumerus when it is in the M. schencki nest. It was placed on the IUCN Red List in 2000 and is classified as a species 'vulnerable' to extinction. Although a separate species from the P. alcon, its DNA genome and appearance are extremely similar, leading many researchers to argue that any differences between the two species are due to intraspecific variation.|$|E
5|$|In {{physical}} systems, Noether's theorem {{provides an}} equivalence between conservation laws and symmetries of the system. However, for cellular automata this theorem <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> apply, because {{instead of being}} governed by {{the energy of the}} system the behavior of the automaton is encoded into its rules, and the automaton is guaranteed to obey certain symmetries (translation invariance in both space and time) regardless of any conservation laws it might obey. Nevertheless, the conserved quantities of certain reversible systems behave similarly to energy in some respects. For instance, if different regions of the automaton have different average values of some conserved quantity, the automaton's rules may cause this quantity to dissipate, so that the distribution of the quantity is more uniform in later states. Using these conserved quantities as a stand-in for the energy of the system can allow it to be analyzed using methods from classical physics.|$|E
5|$|The Devil Children {{titles are}} {{role-playing}} {{games in which}} the player battles against demons. While the player controls a devil child, that character <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>directly</b> fight themselves; instead, they send in their allied demons {{to fight against the}} opponents. This was changed in Book of Fire and Book of Ice, where the devil children are able to fight by using cards. If one of the player's demons falls in battle, another is automatically sent in to take the first one's place. To recruit new demons to their party, the player needs to choose to talk to the demon instead of fighting it, with the demon's response mostly being based on chance. The player can trade demons with other players, which is required to be able to collect all demon types. While the player's character gains experience points, their allied demons do not; to increase their power, the player needs to fuse their demons with each other.|$|E
