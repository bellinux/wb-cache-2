25|$|Much of Augustine's {{later life}} was {{recorded}} {{by his friend}} Possidius, bishop of Calama (present-day Guelma, Algeria), in his Sancti Augustini Vita.

500|$|Due to Romney's exit, Nixon {{declared}} in early March {{that he would}} [...] "greatly expand [...] efforts in the non-primary states," [...] with Time observing that Nixon could now focus his political attacks solely on President Johnson. However, the void also caused problems for Nixon; Time argued that the prospect of soundly defeating second-tier candidates such as former Governor Harold Stassen of Minnesota in the primaries, would not [...] "electrify the voters." [...] The Nixon campaign countered this claim stating that Romney's withdrawal was a [...] "TKO" [...] {{at the hands of}} Nixon. Meanwhile, Rockefeller began to be viewed more as a candidate, articulating that while not wishing to split the party, he was [...] "willing to serve...if called." [...] As talks of other candidates persisted, Nixon continued to campaigning and discussion of the issues.

Nixon easily won the New Hampshire primary on March 12, pulling in 80% of the vote with a write-in campaign for Rockefeller receiving 11%. At the end of March, Rockefeller announced that he would not campaign for the presidency, but would be open to being drafted. Nixon doubted a draft stating that it would only be likely if [...] "I make some rather serious mistake." [...] Reports suggested that the decision caused [...] "Nixon's political stock [...] skyrocket." [...] Polling by Gallup at this time revealed that Nixon led President Johnson 41% to 39% in a three-way race with American Independent Party candidate and former Governor George Wallace of Alabama.|$|E

50|$|Another type of slide {{fence is}} similar {{except that the}} wires {{do not have to}} break and is easier to {{maintain}} and reset. The slide fence consists of a series of fence sections, as shown in the SLIDE FENCE <b>DETAIL</b> <b>drawing</b> (pictured right), which shows a typical installation. Each fence section is held in place by strong springs. At each end of a fence section is an electro-mechanical plug. The plugs maintain a complete electrical circuit that is monitored by signaling equipment. In normal operation, the current through the plugs causes a relay to energize, indicating that the fence is in place. When a rock slide occurs, the fence moves laterally, causing the plug to be removed, breaking the circuit. This causes the relay to become de-energized, indicating that a rock slide has occurred. A contact of the relay is typically used to prevent the approaching signal from displaying a proceed aspect if the fence has been broken. Restoring normal operation requires re-inserting the plugs that were dislodged by the slide.|$|E
50|$|A {{sighting}} telescope (A-B), {{three or four}} feet long, was mounted along {{one side of the}} instrument. A horizon mirror was fixed at a 45° angle in front of the telescope's objective lens (G). This mirror was small enough to allow the observer to see the image in the mirror on one side and to see directly ahead on the other. The index arm (C-D) held an index mirror (H), also at 45° {{to the edge of the}} index arm. The reflective sides of the two mirrors nominally faced each other, so that the image seen in the first mirror is that reflected from the second.With the two mirrors parallel, the index reads 0°. The view through the telescope sees directly ahead on one side and the view from the mirror G sees the same image reflected from mirror H (see <b>detail</b> <b>drawing</b> to the right). When the index arm is moved from zero to a large value, the index mirror reflects an image that is in a direction away from the direct line of sight. As the index arm movement increases, the line of sight for the index mirror moves toward S (to the right in the detail image). This shows a slight deficiency with this mirror arrangement. The horizon mirror will block the view of the index mirror at angles approaching 90°.|$|E
