40|$|Urea {{fertilizer}} factory released CO 2 by two ways, one {{is direct}} CO 2 emission which derives from combustion {{of natural gas}} and other fossil fuel, and the another is indirect CO 2 emissions or due to over product of CO 2. This article shows estimation CO 2, non-CO 2 GHGs and other gas pollutant emissions <b>from</b> <b>Indonesia’s</b> urea fertilizer factories based on natural gas and other liquid fossil fuel consumptions. The specific energy consumption (SEC), specific emissions factor (SEF) of direct and indirect CO 2, non-CO 2 GHGs and other gas pollutant emissions of Indonesia’s urea fertilizer factories were estimated. Direct and indirect CO 2 emissions <b>from</b> <b>Indonesia’s</b> urea fertilizer factories were estimated based on estimation method of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and materials balance calculation methods by considered the natural gas and other fuel consumptions. Results of this study show {{that a lot of}} energy is consumed to produce urea. The SEC of Indonesia’s urea factories was found around 13. 7 to 42. 4 TJ per thousand metric tones urea production. The analysis shows that indirect CO 2 emission gave much more contribution than direct CO 2 emissions did. The SEF of direct and indirect CO 2 emissions <b>from</b> <b>Indonesia’s</b> urea factories were found about 0. 001 and 0. 360 Gg per thousand metric tones urea production, respectively. CO 2, CH 4, CO and NOX emissions <b>from</b> <b>Indonesia’s</b> urea factories in 2003 were estimated to be about 1, 234. 3; 0. 142; 1. 702...|$|R

There were eight teams of indigenous players, with seven identifying as transgender. They came from places like Palm Island in northern Queensland, Samoa, Tonga and Papua New Guinea. Teams with transgender players were allowed to participate in several divisions including men's, mixed and transgender; they were not allowed to compete against the cisgender women's teams.|$|E

5|$|In Africa, where batik was {{originally}} imported by Dutch merchants <b>from</b> <b>Indonesia</b> (then the Netherlands East Indies), paste made from starch or mud {{is used as}} a resist instead of wax. The most developed resist-dyeing skills {{are to be found in}} Nigeria where the Yoruba make adire cloths. Two methods of resist are used: adire eleso which involves tied and stitched designs and adire eleko that uses starch paste. The paste is most often made from cassava starch, rice, and other ingredients boiled together to produce a smooth thick paste. The Yoruba of West Africa use cassava paste as a resist while the Soninke and Wolof people in Senegal uses rice paste. The Bamana people of Mali use mud as a resist.|$|E
5|$|In January 1962, Suharto was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} major general and appointed to lead Operation Mandala, a joint army-navy-air force command based in Makassar.

Fearful that Konfrontasi would leave Java thinly covered by the army, and hand control to the 2 million-strong Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), he authorised a Kostrad intelligence officer, Ali Murtopo, to open secret contacts with the British and Malaysians.|$|E
5|$|New {{migrants}} {{began moving}} <b>from</b> <b>Indonesia</b> and other Southeast Asian countries to more industrialized regions {{around the world}} {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Although these migrants possessed a Chinese heritage, they were often not identified as such; this trend has continued into the modern day. There have been several independent estimates made on the Chinese Indonesian population living in other countries. James Jupp's The Australian People encyclopedia estimated that half of over 30,000 Indonesians living in Australia in the late 1990s are ethnic Chinese, and they have since merged with other Chinese communities. In New Zealand, many migrants reside in the suburbs of Auckland after some 1,500 sought asylum from the 1998 upheaval, of which two-thirds were granted residency.|$|E

5|$|The rediscovery and {{reconstruction}} of Borobudur has been hailed by Indonesian Buddhist as {{the sign of}} the Buddhist revival in Indonesia. In 1934, Narada Thera, a missionary monk from Sri Lanka, visited Indonesia {{for the first time as}} part of his journey to spread the Dharma in Southeast Asia. This opportunity was used by a few local Buddhists to revive Buddhism in Indonesia. A bodhi tree planting ceremony was held in Southeastern side of Borobudur on 10 March 1934 under the blessing of Narada Thera, and some Upasakas were ordained as monks. Once a year, thousands of Buddhist <b>from</b> <b>Indonesia</b> and neighboring countries flock to Borobudur to commemorate national Vesak ceremony.|$|E

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{sizeable}} Filipino population in the city. The first wave of migrants arrived in the late 15th century during the Spanish colonisation, while a later wave arrived in the early 1970s, driven away from the Philippines by political and economic uncertainties there. Most of the earlier migrants have been naturalised as Malaysian citizens. However, {{there are still some}} Filipinos living in the city without proper documentation as illegal immigrants. Most of the Filipino migrants are Tausūgs (Suluk) coming from the southern parts of Philippines. The city also is home to immigrants <b>from</b> <b>Indonesia.</b>|$|E
