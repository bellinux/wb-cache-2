40|$|While confessions are a {{powerful}} form of evidence, innocent people sometimes confess to crimes {{they did not}} commit. Many researchers have studied false confessions through laboratory experiments with university students or by focusing on proven cases of false confession. These approaches have led many researchers to form a conceptual framework that law enforcement interrogative methods are a key cause of false confessions. A gap exists in the literature as few researchers have queried law enforcement about false confessions or consulted with officers who specialize in interrogation. For this study, a qualitative case study approach was used to explore the experiences of 13 federal law enforcement polygraph examiners who specialize in <b>interrogation.</b> <b>Telephone</b> interviews were conducted regarding their approach to criminal interrogation, their experiences with false confessions, and the circumstances when false confessions were elicited. NVivo software was used to organize the data. Common themes in interview responses were identified and reduced to a simplified format that could be understood {{in the context of}} the research questions. The themes identified that participants conduct themselves professionally, they treat criminal subjects respectfully, they avoid unethical interrogative practices, and false confessions result from individual subject characteristics and police misconduct. No participants reported eliciting a false confession. These findings suggest that false confession researchers may have a biased view of how law enforcement officers interrogate due to their overreliance on laboratory experimentation and their focus on false confession cases. This study promotes positive social change by increasing truthful confessions, decreasing false confessions, and providing a more accurate view of what occurs during real world criminal interrogations...|$|E
5000|$|The Swedish Security Service (Säkerhetspolisen , {{abbreviated}} Säpo, until 1989 [...] Rikspolisstyrelsens säkerhetsavdelning abbreviated RPS/Säk) is a Swedish {{government agency}} organised under the Ministry of Justice. It operates like a security {{agency responsible for}} counter-espionage, counter-terrorism, the protection of dignitaries and the constitution. The Swedish Security Service is also tasked with investigating crimes against national security and terrorist crimes. Its main mission, however, is to prevent crime, and not to investigate them. Crime prevention is {{to a large extent}} based on information acquired via contacts with the regular police force, other authorities and organisations, foreign intelligence and security services, and with the use of various intelligence gathering activities, including <b>interrogations,</b> <b>telephone</b> tapping, covert listening devices and hidden surveillance cameras. The Service was, in its present form, founded in 1989, as part of the National Police Board and became an autonomous police agency January 1, 2015. National headquarters are located at Bolstomtavägen in south-east Solna since 2014, drawing together personnel from five different locations into a single 30000 m2 HQ facility.|$|R
5000|$|When {{his father}} {{declared}} bankruptcy in 1954, Cornwell quit Oxford {{to teach at}} Millfield Preparatory School; however, {{a year later he}} returned to Oxford, and graduated in 1956 with a (First Class Honours) Bachelor of Arts degree. He then taught French and German at Eton College for two years, becoming an MI5 officer in 1958. He ran agents, conducted <b>interrogations,</b> tapped <b>telephone</b> lines and effected break-ins. Encouraged by Lord Clanmorris (who wrote crime novels as [...] "John Bingham"), and whilst being an active MI5 officer, Cornwell began writing his first novel, Call for the Dead (1961). Cornwell has identified Lord Clanmorris as one of two models for George Smiley, the spymaster of the Circus, the other being Vivian H. H. Green. [...] As a schoolboy, Cornwell had first met Green when he was the Chaplain and Assistant Master at Sherborne School (1942-51). The friendship continued after Green's move to Lincoln College, where he tutored Cornwell.|$|R
