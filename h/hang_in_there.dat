In the meantime, to paraphrase Roger McGough, I came, I saw, I concurred with those who say: Rome wasn't built in an hour." [...] Similarly opinionated was The Cincinnati Posts Rick Bird, who said that like other HBO series, Rome [...] "takes {{a while to get}} going. After the first episode you will mostly be confused with a dizzying array of characters, intrigue and subplots. <b>Hang</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> By the second episode things take shape and one should be hooked by episode three with this steamy romp through antiquity and its lusty intrigue." [...] Bird found some positive elements; the episode, he said, was [...] "enhanced by marvelous filmmaking including elaborate sets and costumes. Small-screen film art has rarely painted such a realistic picture of ancient Rome." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{losing his}} {{re-election}} bid for Mayor to George Voinovich in 1979, Kucinich initially kept {{a low profile}} in Cleveland politics. He criticized a tax referendum proposed by Voinovich in 1980, which voters eventually approved. He also struggled to find employment and moved to Los Angeles, California, where he stayed with a friend, actress Shirley MacLaine. During the next three years, Kucinich worked as a radio talk-show host, lecturer, and consultant. It was a difficult period for Kucinich financially. Without a steady paycheck, Kucinich fell behind in his mortgage payments, nearly lost his house in Cleveland, and ended up borrowing money from friends, including MacLaine, to keep it. On his 1982 income tax return, Kucinich reported an income of $38. When discussing this period, Kucinich stated, [...] "When I {{was growing up in}} Cleveland, my early experience conditioned me to <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and not to quit... It's one thing to experience that as a child, but when you have to as an adult, it has a way to remind you how difficult things can be. You understand what people go through." ...|$|E

In round 3, referee Jack Reiss docked a point of Corral after warning him for holding Ortiz's left arm. In round 4, Ortiz landed a left hand that sent Corral down. He beat the count, but Ortiz pounced, forcing the referee to stop the fight after 1 minute and 26 seconds. Ortiz kept his options open when speaking in the post fight, “There are a lot of names out there in the welterweight division. At this point I’m going to let my team guide me, because I’ll always be ready for anybody.” He also praised Corral, “Corral is a great fighter who hits hard and I definitely felt it.Top of the line boxers like myself, we <b>hang</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and we perform {{to the best of our}} abilities.

[...] Owen Gleiberman, writing in Entertainment Weekly, observed that [...] "Sam Rockwell is handsome in a rumpled, slightly goofy rabbit-toothed way, but he doesn't really have the look, or aura, of a movie star," [...] Glieberman stated. [...] "He's more like a weirdly sincere space cadet, babbling to himself with puppyish befuddlement, breaking into funky soft dance moves that look as if he's been doing them in his bedroom since he was 8.

Thanks for his direction through the "unchartered waters". I am also greatly indebted to Dr. Quincy Tran, who in spite of his busy schedule in the medical program, took time to train me and was never tired of my numerous questions. ...|$|R
