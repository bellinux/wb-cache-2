2500|$|The Reverend Leonard Jenyns, {{a naturalist}} Darwin had known since {{his time at}} the University of Cambridge, had at Darwin's request contributed the volume on Fish in Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, and was now {{working on a book}} of notes on {{observations}} of plants and animals. On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that [...] "work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These are the facts, which make one understand the working or œconomy of nature.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited." [...] He told Jenyns that he had [...] "continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. I know how much I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years." [...] In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him [...] "With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that I meant to say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in my wildest day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides {{to the question of the}} immutability of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals)." [...] He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about [...] "numerous immense difficulties on my notions" [...] told him that he had [...] "drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & if I thought at some future time, that you would think it worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic." [...] Jenyns never took up this offer to read the [...] "Essay", but did advise Darwin on possible issues with the term [...] "mutation". Darwin replied [...] "it will be years before I publish, so that I shall <b>have</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> think of better words".|$|E
