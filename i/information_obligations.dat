Several examples taken from Portuguese roads are used to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed system. Traffic signs are detected by analyzing color information, notably red and blue, contained on the images. The detected signs are then classified according to their shape characteristics, as triangular, squared and circular shapes. Combining color and shape information, traffic signs are classified into one of the following classes: danger, <b>information,</b> <b>obligation</b> or prohibition. Both the detection and classification algorithms include innovative components to improve the overall system performance.

40|$|The key {{objective}} of the paper is to identify and assess the administrative burdens for businesses in Bulgaria according to the selected national laws related to the EU Internal Market. The study relies on objective data and analytical frameworks {{with a view to}} identify and assess the <b>information</b> <b>obligations</b> stemming from selected laws and regulations, including national rules implementing or transposing European legislation. This is an important step in strengthening Bulgaria’s national policy on better regulation for businesses. <b>Information</b> <b>obligations</b> are those arising from regulation to provide information and data to the public sector or third parties. Administrative burdens represent the “extra” administrative costs linked to collecting and providing information that businesses would not normally have to do {{in the absence of a}} legal obligation. While regulation is important and necessary, these additional costs represent a burden for businesses. It is a burden for business both in terms of money and time, which diverts resources from productive investments and generally discourages entrepreneurship. The methodology used in the paper is based on the Standard Cost Model for Estimating Administrative Costs established for assessing administrative costs imposed by the EU legislation. The paper is developed taking into account the findings of the OECD and the European Commission. The study outlines the results of the administrative costs and administrative burdens for businesses in Bulgaria of totally measured 742 <b>information</b> <b>obligations</b> (IOs) in 16 national laws and regulations to them in 9 selected priority areas during 2013. Even though the study is limited to specific legal acts and to an assessment of costs to business, the results are helpful in understanding the mechanisms by which the administrative costs and administrative burdens accrue. All IOs identified and verified in the paper, related both to national rules implementing or transposing European legislation, are distinguished by specific laws and by specific priority areas. The data collection methods include interviews with business entities (field work) and expert assessments. The results obtained from the study show that more than half of all IOs examined in the paper are concentrated in three selected national laws – the Medicinal Products in Human Medicine Act, the Law on Statistics and the Law on Technical Requirements for Products and Conformity Assessment. More than half of all IOs are associated with implementation of national requirements related to the EU Internal Market. As concerns the value of the administrative burden, the highest share of administrative burden of all identified and evaluated IOs is observed under the Excise Duties and Tax Warehouses Act and the Law on Support for Farmers. The lowest share of the administrative burden of all IOs is found under those laws where the identified and assessed IOs are only a few (the Law on Social Assistance, the Bulgarian Chamber of Builders Act, the Independent Assessors Act and the Cadastre and Land Registry Act) ...|$|E

40|$|Ecologically {{sustainable}} development {{has become a}} major feature of legal systems at the international, national and local levels throughout the world. In Australia, governments have responded to environmental crises by enacting legislation imposing obligations and restrictions over privately-owned land. Whilst these obligations and restrictions may well be necessary to achieve sustainability, the approach to management of information concerning these instruments is problematic. For example, management of <b>information</b> concerning <b>obligations</b> and restrictions in Queensland is fragmented, with some instruments registered or recorded on the land title register, some on external registers, and some information only available in the legislation itself. This approach is used in most Australian jurisdictions. This fragmented approach has led to two separate but interconnected problems. First, the Torrens system is no longer meeting its goal of providing a complete and accurate picture of title. Second, this uncoordinated approach to the management of land titles, and obligations and restrictions on land use, has created a barrier to sustainable management of natural resources. This is because compliance with environmental laws is impaired in the absence of easily accessible and accurate information. These problems demonstrate a clear need for reform in this area. To determine how <b>information</b> concerning these <b>obligations</b> and restrictions may be most effectively managed, this thesis will apply a comparative methodology and consider three case studies, which each utilise different models for management of this information. These jurisdictions will be assessed according to a set of guidelines for comparison to identify which features of their systems provide for effective management of <b>information</b> concerning <b>obligations</b> and restrictions on title and use. Based on this comparison, this thesis will devise a series of recommendations for an effective system for the management of <b>information</b> concerning <b>obligations</b> and restrictions on land title and use, taking into account any potential legal issues and barriers to implementation. This series of recommendations for reform will be supplemented by suggested draft legislative provisions...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{that will allow}} forest and land use policy options to be explored in a repeatable, objective and quantitative way. Construction {{and use of the}} model should lead {{to a better understanding of}} spatial and temporal land use patterns. It will provide detailed spatially-explicit data on a range of parameters to enable rigorous testing and offer insights for further development. The model is based on the assumption that land use patterns ultimately are shaped by individuals who make rational decisions based on available <b>information,</b> <b>obligations</b> and expectations (social as well as economic). Since these decisions are rational, they, and the resulting land use patterns, can be modelled and predicted. In making these decisions, individuals balance the anticipated returns and risks, and individual strategies (i. e. emphasis on profit maximization or risk minimization) reflect status and security. Important inputs to the model include spatial (land tenure, topography, soils), social (demography, clan obligations, cultural traditions), and economic data (crop yields, market prices, transport costs). Land use is not an input to the model, but the model can predict spatially-explicit land use patterns. Thus land use predictions may provide a robust way to test the model. The model can be implemented in a hierarchical way, so that it can operate at the village, provincial or national scale, with the detail of inputs and outputs varying accordingly...|$|E
