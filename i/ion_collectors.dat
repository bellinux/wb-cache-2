40|$|Abstract. Two {{types of}} direct energy {{converter}}s, cusp direct energy converter (CUSPDEC) and traveling wave (TW) DEC, {{used to produce}} electricity from thermal ions and fusion products in an advanced fueled fusion, are investigated using small-scale devices. In CUSPDEC, magnetized electrons are deflected along the field lines of the cusp magnetic field to the line cusp region and collected by an electron collector, while weakly magnetized ions can traverse the separatrix and enter into the point cusp region. Thus, ions are separated from electrons, and flow into an <b>ion</b> <b>collector</b> to produce DC power. By using a normal cusp magnetic field, the particle separation is achieved for low energy electrons, but not for electrons with much higher energies. This difficulty is overcome by applying a slanted cusp magnetic field, which has the capability of separating electrons with energies as high as 8 keV. Efficiencies of energy conversion of separated ions with large thermal spread of energy are measured to be ~ 55 %. An additional lateral electrode, together with the existing collector, constitutes a two-stage <b>ion</b> <b>collector</b> that provides distributed ion-decelerating fields. From the measured voltage-current characteristics, the efficiency of this collector {{is estimated to be}} improved to 65 - 70 %, which is consistent with the calculation.

The TWDEC device has shown that the energies of ions of 3 - 6 keV can be decreased by 10 - 15 % for a one-wavelength decelerator. This would give a total efficiency of 60 - 70 % for a full-length decelerator.
