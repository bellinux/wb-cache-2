5|$|After the 5.5 Richter Scale {{magnitude}} 1968 Illinois earthquake, scientists {{realized that}} there was a previously unknown fault under Saline County, just north of Eldorado, Illinois near Harrisburg. This <b>fault</b> <b>is</b> called the Cottage Grove Fault, a small tear in the Earth's rock running west–east, in the Southern Illinois Basin. The <b>fault</b> <b>is</b> connected to the north–south trending Wabash Valley Fault System at its eastern end. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists reveal that monoclines, anticlines, and synclines are present within the region; these signs suggest deformation during the Paleozoic era coincident to strike-slip faulting nearby.|$|E
5|$|Poor {{breeding}} may {{be encouraged}} {{by the fact that}} many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury. If the injury is linked to a conformational fault, the <b>fault</b> <b>is</b> likely to be passed to the next generation. Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures on a horse with crooked legs. This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on.|$|E
5|$|Tensional forces {{forming the}} Basin and Range physiogeographic {{province}} {{to the west}} about 20 to 25million years ago in Tertiary time created the two faults that bound the Markagunt Plateau (which underlies the park): the Sevier Fault on {{the east and the}} Hurricane Fault on the west. The Hurricane fault zone is a major, active, steeply west-dipping normal fault that stretches at least 155miles (250km) from south of the Grand Canyon northward to Cedar City, Utah. Along the southern boundary of the park, tectonic displacement along this <b>fault</b> <b>is</b> about 3,600ft (1,098m). Several other normal faults also developed on the plateau.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The work {{presented}} in this paper addresses fault detection and isolation properties of isolation enhanced PCA methods. Detection and isolation results for several different <b>fault</b> types <b>is</b> illustrated via simulation studies using a rigorous first principles based paper machine simulator. Three sensor faults and an actuator <b>fault</b> <b>were</b> studied. The first sensor <b>fault</b> <b>was</b> a pressure measurement in the steam section, whereas the two remaining sensor <b>faults</b> <b>were</b> product quality measurements of moisture and basis weight. The actuator <b>fault</b> <b>was</b> related to the basis weight valve. All <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> illustrated to be properly detected and isolated with one of the studied methods...|$|R

30|$|Major {{and minor}} <b>faults</b> <b>were</b> {{identified}} based mainly on break in reflection events or abrupt termination of reflection events. The <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> {{represented on the}} seismic section as discontinuous lines along a preferred orientation of reflectors. The <b>faults</b> <b>were</b> picked by assigning names, and these were transferred from dip section to the strike sections of the seismic section.|$|R
5|$|The Salton Trough {{is part of}} {{the complex}} plate {{boundary}} between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate where it undergoes a transition from the continental transform of the San Andreas Fault system to the series of short spreading centers of the East Pacific Rise linked by oceanic transforms in the Gulf of California. The two main right–lateral strike-slip fault strands that extend across {{the southern part of the}} trough are the Elsinore Fault Zone/Laguna Salada Fault to the western side of the trough and the Imperial Fault to the east. The Imperial <b>Fault</b> <b>is</b> linked to the San Andreas Fault through the Brawley Seismic Zone, which is a spreading center beneath the southern end of the Salton Sea.|$|E
5|$|The Mendocino <b>Fault</b> <b>is</b> seismically active with mostly {{small and}} {{moderate}} earthquakes, but the largest event that was unequivocally {{associated with the}} fault was the M6.9 earthquake on September 1, 1994, at 125.8 W longitude. Aftershocks of that event with corresponding dextral strike-slip focal mechanisms occurred farther {{to the east and}} close to the Mendocino Triple Junction. Another large event (7.3–7.6) occurred on January 31, 1922 (with an aftershock of M7+ the next day) but the sources of these shocks could not be determined with any precision as the first seismographs did not arrive in the area until 1932. Due to their offshore epicenters all of these events caused little damage though were felt across a broad area. Previous Gorda plate events include the July 13 and August 17, 1991, shocks of 6.8 and 7.1 and the M7.3 event on November 10, 1980, west of Arcata.|$|E
25|$|The Devils Mountain <b>Fault</b> <b>is</b> seismically active, {{and there}} is {{evidence}} of Holocene offsets. If the entire 125km length ruptured in a single event the resulting earthquake could be as large as magnitude 7.5. However, there are indications that the <b>fault</b> <b>is</b> segmented, which might limit rupturing and earthquake magnitude.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{real-time}} {{systems have}} been used inmany time-critical applications, such as industrial process controls and aircraft autopilots. The tasks in such applica-tions have stringent timing constraints. They must generate correct results before their deadlines even in the presence offaults. As a result, the ability to tolerate <b>faults</b> <b>is</b> a critical need in real-time systems. <b>Faults</b> can <b>be</b> either permanent, intermittent or transient in nature. Permanent <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> caused by the complete fail-ure of a hardware component, and are typically tolerated by using hardware redundancy. Transient <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> short-livedmalfunctions of a computing component that cause an incorrect result. Intermittent <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> repeated occurrencesof transient faults...|$|R

25|$|The Taganga <b>Fault</b> <b>is</b> the tectonic lineament {{separating}} {{the village of}} Taganga from the Tayrona Park in the north. The activity of the NE-trending fault has produced carbonitization of the phyllites. The <b>fault</b> <b>is</b> a reverse fault that is characterized by serpentinites, the presence of epidote {{and the formation of}} talc minerals.|$|E
25|$|The {{transform}} boundary {{defined by}} the San Andreas <b>Fault</b> <b>is</b> not perfectly straight, and the stresses between the Pacific and North American Plates are diffused over a wide region of the West, extending {{as far as the}} eastern side of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The Hayward <b>Fault</b> <b>is</b> one of the secondary faults in this diffuse zone, along with the Calaveras Fault to the east and the San Gregorio Fault, west of the San Andreas.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of cross-cutting relationships {{pertains to the}} formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a <b>fault</b> <b>is</b> found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the <b>fault</b> <b>is</b> a normal fault or a thrust fault.|$|E
30|$|Low-porosity and low-permeability {{fractures}} {{have low}} porosity and permeability values and are mainly located in Yangcun, Jinhu, {{and along the}} edge of the sag. The sand bodies in these regions are thin and have poor lateral continuity, high clay contents and low degrees of brittleness. These fractures are mainly present in areas where <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> poorly developed. The <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> long but are low in density, and secondary <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> few.|$|R
30|$|<b>Fault</b> latency <b>is</b> {{defined as}} the {{interval}} between the moments of fault occurrence and error generation (Shin and Lee [1984]). This information is extremely important, since it directly affects {{how to handle the}} error caused by the fault. In terms of latency, <b>faults</b> can <b>be</b> permanent, transient or intermittent. Permanent <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> continuous and stable. In hardware, permanent faults reflect an irreversible physical change. Permanent <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> also known as “hard” faults. Transient faults result from temporary environmental conditions, and can be fixed by changing the respective conditions that cause the <b>fault.</b> Transient <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> also known as “soft” <b>faults.</b> Intermittent <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> only occasionally present due to unstable hardware or varying hardware or software states. Intermittent and transient <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> the major source of system errors. Even when {{it is not possible to}} repair the fault, the use of redundant resources allows the system to tolerate faults (Gärtner [1999]; Lee and Anderson [1990]). The manifestations of transient and intermittent faults and of incorrect hardware or software design are much more difficult to determine than permanent faults.|$|R
40|$|Overtesting induces {{unnecessary}} yield loss. Untestable faults have {{no effect}} on normal functions of circuits. However, in scan testing, untestable <b>faults</b> may <b>be</b> detected through scan chains. Detected untestable faults cause overtesting. Untestable faults consist of uncontrollable faults, unobservable faults, and uncontrollable and unobservable faults. Uncontrollable <b>faults</b> may <b>be</b> detected under invalid states through scan chains by shift-in operations. Unobservable <b>faults</b> cannot <b>be</b> observed at primary outputs, but their effects may be propagated to scan flip-flops. Thus, unobservable <b>faults</b> may <b>be</b> detected through scan chains by shift-out operations. Several methods {{to reduce the number of}} detected untestable <b>faults</b> <b>were</b> recently proposed. These methods identify invalid states and generate test patterns avoiding invalid states. As the result, the number of detected uncontrollable <b>faults</b> <b>was</b> reduced. However, they cannot reduce the number of detected unobservable faults. In this paper, both uncontrollable and unobservable <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> identified using a multi-cycle capture test generation method. We evaluate the relationship between the numbers of untestable faults and the number of time expansions for ISCAS’ 89 benchmark circuits, and also evaluate factors that untestable <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> identified...|$|R

25|$|The Yammouneh <b>fault</b> <b>is</b> {{the main}} fault strand within the Lebanon {{restraining}} bend, carrying {{most of the}} plate boundary displacement. It is SSW-NNE trending and runs for about 170km from the northwestern end of the Hula Basin to its junction with the Missyaf Fault. It has been the location of several major historical earthquakes, such as the 1202 Syria event. The estimated average slip rate along the Yammouneh <b>fault</b> <b>is</b> 4.0 to 5.5mm per year, with a major earthquake recurrence interval of 1020 to 1175 years. There have been no major earthquakes since that in 1202.|$|E

25|$|This {{fault zone}} {{comprises}} two main fault strands, the Rachaya and Serghaya faults. The Serghaya fault branches off the Hula Eastern Border Fault, continuing northeastwards {{to the south}} of Mount Hermon into the Anti-Lebanon range where it becomes SSW-NNE trending. The fault has a slip rate of about 1.4mm per year. Movement on this <b>fault</b> <b>is</b> thought to be responsible for the November 1759 earthquake. The Rachaya fault also branches off the Hula Eastern Border Fault, trending SSW-NNE, passing to the north of Mount Hermon. No slip rate has yet been estimated for this fault. The Rachaya <b>fault</b> <b>is</b> the interpreted location of the October 1759 earthquake.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, USGS {{scientists}} {{said the}} <b>fault</b> <b>is</b> due for another magnitude 6.8 to 7.0 earthquake, with the California Geological Survey concurring, stating they {{believe there is}} a 31 percent chance of a magnitude-6.7 earthquake or greater along the Rogers Creek-Hayward Fault in the next 30 years.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} fault {{tolerance}} in cooperative manipulators rigidly {{connected to a}} solid object is addressed in this paper. Four <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> considered: free-swinging joint faults, locked joint faults, incorrect measured joint position, and incorrect measured joint velocity. The <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> first detected by a fault detection and isolation system. Freeswinging and locked joint <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> isolated using artificial neural networks. The other <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> isolated based on the kinematic constraints imposed on the cooperative system. After {{the isolation of the}} faults, the control system is reconfigured.

40|$|This paper studies {{pseudo-random}} pattern {{testing of}} bridging faults. Although bridging <b>faults</b> <b>are</b> generally more random pattern testable than stuck-at <b>faults,</b> examples <b>are</b> shown to illustrate that some bridging <b>faults</b> can <b>be</b> much less random pattern testable than stuck-at faults. A fast method for identifying these random-pattern-resistant bridging <b>faults</b> <b>is</b> described.
