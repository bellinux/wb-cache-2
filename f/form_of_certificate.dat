5000|$|On January 9, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the {{appointment}} only required the signature of {{the governor and the}} secretary of state's signature is not required to make the appointment valid.

The State Supreme Court noted that a different form was available: White had already registered the appointment in Illinois's official records, and Illinois law requires the Secretary of State to provide a certified copy, with signature and seal, of any of the state's official records to anyone willing to pay the fee. It suggested that Burris simply obtain a certified copy of the appointment registration. In its Burris v. White ruling the State Supreme Court not only declared that the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> contained in rule II of the Standing Rules of the United States Senate was, according to its own terms, only a recommended form but it further remarked that [...] "no explanation has been given as to how any rule of the Senate, whether it be formal or merely a matter of tradition, could supersede the authority to fill vacancies conferred on the states by the federal constitution". Following the ruling, White provided Burris with a certified copy of the appointment's registration, and Burris delivered that copy, bearing the State Seal, to the Secretary of the Senate. On January 12, 2009, after the Secretary of the Senate announced that she and the Senate Parliamentarian deemed Burris's new credentials valid, Senate leaders decided to seat Burris.

40|$|Abstract: SPKI/SDSI is a {{framework}} that combines a simple public-key infrastructure and a simple distributed security infrastructure with a means of defining local name spaces. It allows principals, {{which can be a}} person or an organization, to locally create groups of principals and delegate rights to other principals or groups of principals by issuing certificates.
