40|$|Children’s need of {{assistance}} during {{the evacuation of}} a preschool is taken for granted when planning for fire safety. This calls for comprehensive technical and organizational <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> mesures. The aim of this report is to examine child behavior in a situation requiring evacuation and it’s implications for organizational and technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> To answer this question three areas of focus have been established; technical and organizational <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> at preschools and child behavior during evacuation. Technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> has been investigated according to the written rules and recommendations. The organization of <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> has been investigated at four preschools according to Brandkompetensutvecklingsschema, BUS, which describes the level of <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> awareness of an organization. Child behavior during an evacuation has been examined through studies of relevant literature. Two studies of evacuation, one from Denmark and one from Russia, that consider child behavior are referred to. In Sweden the technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> is planned according to laws and regulations, among other Plan och Bygglagen and Boverkets byggregler for which preschools place specific requirements. The most significant difference in planning of building <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> at a preschool {{is that it is}} assumed the children need help during evacuation. The organization of <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> is regulated by the Law Lagen om skydd mot olyckor, that requires preschools to work systematically with <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> and have sufficient documentation ensuring that reasonable <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> measures are taken and maintained in a functional state. Child behavior during evacuation differs from that of adults in movement patterns, speed of gait, preparation time and need for physical and verbal help. In three of the BUS-evaluated preschools we saw {{that when it comes to}} systematic work for <b>fire</b> <b>protection,</b> the technical aspects are in focus and some anxiety was registered about conducting evacuation exercises with the children. One preschool indicated a very developed level of organization regarding <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> This preschool regularly conducted evacuation exercises and responded positively. There are many things to take into account when planning for a preschool build. How child behavior differs from adult behavior needs to be considered in both the technical and organizational <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> The contractor needs to understand the importance organizational <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> and the user of the building needs to understand how the technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> is intended to work. It is also important for the building user to prioritize correctly; the user should not only focus on the technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> measures but also must understand the importance of systematic fire preventive actions.

40|$|Background: Hotels are {{considered}} a risky environment because guests {{are not expected to}} be awake and are expected to have poor local knowledge. Although hotels doesn’t have acceptable <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> according to the only previously known study in this area. This is a problem because every four to five days there is a hotel fire. The hotels would be able to reach an acceptable fire safety by pursuing a systematic <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> and take certain construction actions. Aim: Identifying details that need to be introduced in hotels daily work with <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> based on the Swedish law and case studies. Method: A literature review and two case studies of hotel fires. Results: The hotel in Sweden followed the Swedish legislation in force in 2009 and had a good organizational <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> The hotel mainly needed to improve was the structural <b>fire</b> <b>protection,</b> adapted for disabled people, control of the acoustics in the evacuation alarm and had more smoke detectors. The hotel in England didn’t follow the law in force in England in 2007 and was nearly entirely lacking <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> They needed primarily improve the structural <b>fire</b> <b>protection,</b> adapted for disabled people, upgrade their alarm, had several smoke detectors and had a systematic <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> Conclusion: Swedish legislation still needs to be clear up because there is still room for interpretation of the laws as they are functional requirements. It is good that the Swedish legislation has adapted to fires that already has occurred in Sweden, but what could be done better today is motivate hotels to get involved in their <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> A committed management in hotels means better systematic <b>fire</b> <b>protections</b> and more money spend on the <b>fire</b> <b>protection.</b> One way to motivate hotel managements is to further inform about the consequences of a fire and to encourage hotels to certify themselves. But is not enough to only have a good systematic <b>fire</b> <b>protection,</b> the technical <b>fire</b> <b>protection</b> also needs to upgrade. It should be introduce higher demands that the hotels should be more handicap-friendly and update their fire alarms, because it saves lives and lower the material damage...|$|R
