40|$|This article {{defends the}} claim that the {{philosophical}} aspect has been seriously underrated in the scheme of the conceptualization of contextual societal forces shaping <b>education</b> <b>systems.</b> The rise of neo-Marxist paradigms since the 1970 s has resulted in a disproportionate emphasis on social and economic systems as factors shaping national <b>education</b> <b>systems.</b> However, empirical research has recently rendered evidence regarding how philosophical frameworks shape children’s way of viewing the world and how they think. This article provides examples of this. Such philosophical and/or conceptual differences need to be factored in the design and planning of <b>education</b> <b>systems.</b> Some implications have been outlined regarding an expanded view of the role of philosophy and/or life-concept for the planning and development of <b>education</b> <b>systems</b> and for comparative education as a field of scholarly research...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{considering}} {{how best to}} optimize distance <b>education</b> <b>systems,</b> economy (cost effectiveness and efficiency), technology (communication technologies) and equity (gender, accessibility, minority, language, religion etc.) are vital issues in any distance <b>education</b> <b>systems.</b> Moreover, how end-users, distance learners, can equally share and exchange knowledge and resources for educational purposes, how they can promote their higher-order thinking skills {{as well as how}} they can cope with the limitations they have (such as time, age, gender, language etc.) are major concerns in distance education milieus. Kurubacak strongly emphasize that interactive radio programs, as a forgotten educational media, with a little cost can effectively integrate in any distance <b>education</b> <b>systems.</b> Therefore, the main {{purpose of this paper is}} to focus on interactive radio programs to build critical and creative knowledge networks among diverse learners in the distance <b>education</b> <b>systems</b> of developing countries...|$|R

But what is meant by such a concept differs from system to system. In this study we typify <b>education</b> <b>systems</b> based on indicators of institutional contexts such as: the financial base of public-private education/schools, differences in their governance structure, locus of control, and the degrees of freedom of (parental) school choice available in countries. We develop configurations of <b>education</b> <b>systems</b> based on these institutional context characteristics and establish the relationships between quality and equity of West European <b>education</b> <b>systems</b> and certain institutional characteristics...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Clinton made {{reform of the}} Arkansas <b>education</b> <b>system</b> a top {{priority}} of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was also an attorney {{as well as the}} chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's <b>education</b> <b>system.</b> Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session—the longest in Arkansas history. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).|$|E

It concludes that a knowledgedriven global economy demands a larger proportion of the human capital and that this forces the higher <b>education</b> <b>systems</b> to redesign their strategies, <b>education</b> <b>systems,</b> policies and structures in order to compete effectively in the global economy and meet the demands of economic globalisation...|$|R
