5|$|By mid-1944, {{his health}} had {{deteriorated}} to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was evacuated to Australia, {{and for a}} time was not expected to live. By early 1945 he had recovered sufficiently to be appointed to command the 6th Division. While flying to assume this new command, the RAAF Lockheed Hudson aircraft he was travelling in crashed into the sea, killing all on board.|$|E
5|$|Gerard was {{a patron}} of learning, to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> urged {{at least one}} of his clergy to study Hebrew, a {{language}} not commonly studied at that time. He himself was a student of astrology, which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly because of such rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside York Minster after his sudden death in 1108. His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the cathedral porch.|$|E
5|$|Horsefield did not confine his {{scientific}} interests to botany, as he also studied algebra, mensuration and astronomy. Charles Horsefield had also encouraged {{his son in}} the last pursuit, taking him to meet Robert Ward, an astronomer in Blackley who had a telescope. John Horsefield developed {{an interest in the}} subject to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> constructed an orrery, much to the bewilderment of his neighbours.|$|E
5000|$|Paire's {{style of}} play is characterised by its flashiness, unpredictability and at times inconsistency. The main {{strength}} of his game is his double-handed backhand, known for its speed and spin. Paire often uses topspin backhands cross court at great speed and acute angles {{to set up a}} powerful backhand down-the-line to finish off points. In contrast, his forehand is relatively less powerful and consistent, particularly when played on the defense, to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> been known to hit backhands inside-out.|$|R
5000|$|Already disliked, he {{delighted in}} his {{promotion}} as a Commissioner, {{and set about}} his task at Canterbury with enthusiasm, {{so much so that}} his parishioners would openly flock to attack him, to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> soon <b>he</b> had to carry out his task with Cromwell's soldiers to protect him.|$|R
2500|$|Drudge {{has been}} called [...] "the Walter Cronkite of his era" [...] by Mark Halperin and John F. Harris, and [...] "the country's reigning mischief-maker" [...] by Todd Purdum of The New York Times. Michael Isikoff of Newsweek said [...] "Drudge is a menace to honest, {{responsible}} journalism. And to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> read and people believe what they read, he's dangerous." [...] According to Camille Paglia, he is [...] "the kind of bold, entrepreneurial, free-wheeling, information-oriented outsider we need far more of in this country." [...] David McClintick described him as, [...] "a modern Tom Paine, a possible precursor to millions of town criers using the Internet to invade the turf of bigfoot journalists." ...|$|R
5|$|In 2007, the Court {{upheld a}} federal statute banning partial-birth {{abortion}} in Gonzales v. Carhart. University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R. Stone, a former colleague of Scalia's, criticized Gonzales, stating that religion had influenced the outcome because all five justices {{in the majority}} were Catholic, whereas the dissenters were Protestant or Jewish. This angered Scalia to such an <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> stated he would not speak at the University of Chicago as long as Stone was there.|$|E
5|$|In January 1566 Sultan Suleiman I {{had ruled}} the Ottoman Empire for 46 years {{and went to}} war for the last time. He was 72 years old and, {{although}} having gout to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was carried on a litter, he nominally commanded his thirteenth military campaign. On 1 May 1566 the Sultan left Constantinople {{at the head of}} one of the largest armies he had ever commanded.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's General Order Number 40 {{was quickly}} {{condemned}} by Republicans in Washington, especially by the Radicals, while President Johnson wholeheartedly approved. Heedless {{of the situation}} in Washington, Hancock soon put his words into action, refusing local Republican politicians' requests to use his power to overturn elections and court verdicts, while also letting it be known that open insurrection would be suppressed. Hancock's popularity within the Democratic party grew to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was considered a potential presidential nominee for that party in the 1868 election. Although Hancock collected a significant number of delegates at the 1868 convention, his presidential possibilities went unfulfilled. Even so, he was henceforth identified as a rare breed in politics: one who believed in the Democratic Party's principles of states' rights and limited government, but whose anti-secessionist sentiment was unimpeachable.|$|E
50|$|As a student, Brijmohan was {{far from}} a timid backbencher. He would often protest against anyunfair and unjust {{practice}} or happening in the school to an <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> was 15, he headed a bunch of students and went on strike against the unfair means of marks distribution in his school. He would always be at the forefront.|$|R
6000|$|By degrees the murderer's drove {{of black}} [...] "cattle" [...] {{increased}} {{to such an}} <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> approached the neighbourhood of the village in which Harold and Disco sojourned, he began to think <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had obtained about as many as he could conveniently manage, and meditated turning his face eastward, little dreaming how near he was to a thousand dollars' worth of property, {{in the shape of}} ransom for two white men! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{will never}} do," [...] he exclaimed, rising to his feet, resting his rifle in a {{position}} of safety, and then stretching himself to his utmost <b>extent</b> so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> became thoroughly awake. After this [...] "rouser," [...] as he called it, he sat down again, and almost immediately fell fast asleep.|$|R
5|$|Lethbridge's heart {{condition}} worsened, to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was unable to}} attend his mother's funeral in 1970. He eventually required 24-hour care, and was transferred to Nuffield Hospital in Exeter, where he died in his sleep on 30 September 1971. His body was interned at the family plot in Heytesbury, Wiltshire. As the Branscombe house was owned by the Lethbridge Family Trust, Mina was obliged to move out after her husband's death, and she sold his belongings out of financial necessity. Mina also collected together Lethbridge's unfinished book {{with the help of}} writer Colin Wilson; together they assembled it into publishable form and it was brought out by Routledge in 1976 as The Power of the Pendulum.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rana Bahadur Shah's youth {{had been}} spent in pampered luxury. In 1794 Rana Bahadur came of age, {{and his first}} act was to re-constitute the government, with his uncle, Bahadur Shah, removed from all {{official}} position. In mid 1795, he became infatuated with a Maithili Brahman widow, Kantavati Jha, and married her on the oath of making their illegitimate half-caste son (as per the Hindu law of that time) the heir apparent, by excluding the legitimate heir from his previous marriage. By 1797, {{his relationship with his}} uncle, who was living a retired life, and who wanted to seek refuge in China on the pretext of meeting the new emperor, had deteriorated to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ordered his imprisonment on 19 February 1797 and his subsequent murder on 23 June 1797. Such acts earned Rana Bahadur notoriety both among courtiers and common people, especially among Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{played a}} vital role in the side's success in the Test series, {{particularly}} with the ball. Despite a back injury which meant he passed one Test without bowling, he took 13 wickets in the series at an average of 26.28, and also contributed 184 runs at an average of 23.15. He {{played a key role in}} subduing England's leading batsmen, Len Hutton and Denis Compton, with a barrage of short-pitched bowling, troubling Hutton to such an <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was dropped for the Third Test. In all first-class matches on the tour, Miller scored 1,088 runs at 47.30 and took 56 wickets at 17.58. Bradman gave him a light bowling workload during the tour matches, to keep him fresh for the Test matches.|$|E
60|$|Lantry professed {{himself to}} be quite willing to oblige an old {{customer}} to <b>that</b> <b>extent.</b> <b>He</b> could well afford it, he said; and it was unquestionable truth <b>that</b> <b>he</b> uttered, for his charges were exorbitant.|$|R
60|$|Godfrey staggered, but {{fortunately}} the soft hat he was wearing, upon {{the brim of}} which the stroke fell, broke its weight to some <b>extent,</b> so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not really hurt. Only now he went quite mad {{in a kind of}} icy way, and, springing at Sir John with the lightness of a leopard, dealt him two blows, one with his left hand and the next with his right.|$|R
5000|$|<b>That</b> is, when <b>he</b> {{advanced}} {{towards the}} East in Babylon, the people, {{who had no}} shelter were the captured tribes of Israel. The reason the Quran mentions no more on the topic is because the whole epic is written in the Book of Kings, of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). The Quran simply says at 18:90, [...] "To the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> reached the rising-place of the sun, he found it rising upon a nation for which We had not kept any shelter from it." ...|$|R
5|$|The clubs {{had also}} been paired {{together}} in the fourth round of the FA Cup in February 2003. Paul Scholes and Ruud van Nistelrooy of Manchester United, and Patrick Vieira of Arsenal were all shown yellow cards within the first seven minutes of the match and referee Jeff Winter had to call Vieira and Roy Keane together to calm their teammates down. Keane himself received a yellow card {{in the first half}} and Ryan Giggs missed an open goal from 18yards. Arsenal eventually won the match 2–0 and the result infuriated Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson to such an <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> kicked a boot across the changing room that hit David Beckham above the left eye.|$|E
5|$|The Arab Ba'ath Party {{merged with}} Akram al-Hawrani's Arab Socialist Party to {{establish}} the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1952; Aflaq was elected the party's leader in 1954. During the mid-to-late 1950s the party began developing relations with Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt, which {{eventually led to the}} establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR). Nasser forced Aflaq to dissolve the party, which he did, but without consulting with party members. Shortly after the UAR's dissolution, Aflaq was reelected as Secretary General of the National Command of the Ba'ath Party. Following the 8th of March Revolution, Aflaq's position within the party was weakened to such an <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was forced to resign as the party's leader in 1965. Aflaq was ousted during the 1966 Syrian coup d'état, which led to a schism within the Ba'ath Party. He escaped to Lebanon, but later went to Iraq. In 1968 Aflaq was elected Secretary General of the Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party; during his tenure he held no de facto power. He held the post until his death on 23 June 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{trust the}} Archduke placed in Schmitt was briefly {{interrupted}} in 1799 {{when he was}} connected, by rumor, to the 29 April assassination of the French delegates to the Congress of Rastatt. The assassination occurred as the delegation was leaving the city. The official investigation into the assassination placed enormous pressure on Schmitt, to such an <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> briefly resigned as Charles' Chief of Staff, but he was quickly reinstated. On 1 March 1800, Schmitt was promoted to Feldmarschallleutnant, but later in that year, the Archduke was himself replaced as commander-in-chief by Field Marshal Pál Kray. Although Schmitt remained on Kray's staff, he again requested retirement, claiming he was tired and could no longer cope with {{the stress of the}} job. In reality, he and Kray's Quartermaster General, Generalmajor Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles, seldom saw eye-to-eye on any of the main issues facing the army and Kray relied more on Chasteler than on Schmitt. His request was initially refused, but on 19 August 1800, Emperor Francis II approved the petition when Kray seconded it. Schmitt went first to Vienna and then Hostitz at Kromeriz, near Brno. There he lived with his old friend Ferdinand Ritter von Geißlern until 1805.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Majid Musisi was {{on track}} to make light work of Jimmy Kirunda's record of 32 goals a season when he netted a mindboggling 29 goals in the league's first round. In his final league appearance, he tormented KCC goalie Sadiq Wassa to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> scored his fourth in the 5-0 win, he simply walked off the field as if to suggest that {{domestic}} opposition no longer matched his ambitions. Nevertheless, he extended his league tally to 144 goals.|$|R
50|$|Author David Kahn {{wrote that}} “Gimpel’s ghostwritten {{account of the}} mission, Spy for Germany, must be used with the {{greatest}} caution, as it differs {{in a number of}} critical points from his (FBI) statement. The most important are the book’s claims <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was assigned to ferret out atomic secrets, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> succeeded to some <b>extent,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> radioed a message to Germany. None of these are supported by his statement or by Colepaugh’s or by postwar interrogations of his spymasters, and the atomic claim is specifically contradicted by a statement of Schellenberg’s".|$|R

5|$|While Rowley and Hamelin had sparred in the Indian Ocean, Corbet {{had made}} the lengthy journey back to Britain. During his time in command of Nereide, Corbet had already {{developed}} {{a reputation as a}} strict disciplinarian, regularly beating his men for the slightest infractions, to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had provoked a brief mutiny on Nereide in 1808. His reputation spread before him, and when he switched commands with Captain Richard Raggett of HMS Africaine, he was met with a storm of protest from Africaines crew. Although none of the men aboard Africaine had served with Corbet before, his preference for brutal punishment was well known in the Navy and the crew {{sent a letter to the}} Admiralty insisting that they would not serve under him. Concerned at what they considered to be mutiny, the Admiralty sent three popular officers to Africaine with the message that if the protest was quietly dropped there would be no courts-martial for mutiny but if not, the entire crew would be liable to attack. To emphasise the threat, the frigate HMS Menelaus was brought alongside with her gunports open and her cannon ready to fire. Chastened, the crew of Africaine allowed Corbet aboard and the frigate sailed for the Indian Ocean a few days later, carrying instructions for the authorities at Madras to prepare an expeditionary force to invade Isle de France.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Bhimsen {{was able}} to {{continue}} making all the administrative decisions of the country, while the Regent Queen Tripurasundari would unquestioningly approve these decisions by stamping the royal seal issued {{in the name of}} King Rajendra on these government orders. The Regent never dared to express any doubts regarding Bhimsen's decisions. Nevertheless, {{to make sure that the}} King, his wives – Samrajya Laxmi Devi (senior) and Rajya Lakshmi Devi (junior) – and the Regent were insulated from influences of people other than Bhimsen and his closest relatives, Bhimsen had instated his youngest brother, General Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the royal palace to keep a watch on the royal family and to keep guard against any outside person. Any priest or courtier who wished to be granted an interview with the King, the Queens, or the Regent, had to get an approval from Ranbir Singh and the interview had to be conducted under his watchful presence. Similarly, the royal family were not allowed to leave the palace without Bhimsen's permission either. Bhimsen had also neglected the formal education of Rajendra, due to which he had grown to be uncritical and weak minded to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was even unaware that he was virtually a prisoner. However, his wives were more alert and wary of Bhimsen since, according to Baburam Acharya, they received unfiltered news of the world outside the royal palace from their handmaidens, who would leave the palace compounds and go to their homes during their menstruation and gather news and rumors of the day, which they would then relate to the Queens.|$|E
25|$|That McDowell's {{career in}} {{government}} as Tánaiste is over is partly {{of his own}} making as he courted controversy to such a fevered <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> became the most unpopular political leader in the country.|$|E
500|$|Myers {{was known}} as the [...] "Flying Dutchman" [...] and the [...] "Mohawk Dutchman" [...] because of his location, name, and being a balloonist.

5|$|Gaudí's {{personal}} appearance—Nordic features, {{blond hair}} and blue eyes—changed radically {{over the course of}} time. As a young man, he dressed like a dandy in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaudí ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> sometimes <b>he</b> was taken for a beggar, such as after the accident that caused his death.|$|R
25|$|In appearance, Fox was dark, corpulent and hairy, to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> {{was born}} his father {{compared}} {{him to a}} monkey. His round face was dominated by his luxuriant eyebrows, with the result <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was known among the Whigs as 'the Eyebrow.' Though he became increasingly dishevelled and fat in middle age, the young Fox had been a very fashionable figure; in particular, {{he had been the}} leader of the 'Maccaroni' set of extravagant young followers of Continental fashions. Fox enjoyed riding and cricket but, in the latter case, the combination of his impulsive nature and considerable weight led to his often being run out between wickets.|$|R
25|$|McCreery {{regarded}} Montgomery as excessively cautious, {{and indeed}} some historians {{have suggested that}} Montgomery failed to press home his advantage after the Battle of Alamein to the <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> might have done (see, for example, Corelli Barnett, The Desert Generals).|$|E
