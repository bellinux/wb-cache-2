5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> a Classical building.

Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E

5|$|The {{chronology}} {{for activities}} in Greece {{during the years}} 355–352 BC <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> clear (see below). Philip certainly started besieging Methone, the last Athenian possession in Macedon, during this period, but different historians choose different dates for this siege. There are two main theories, either 355–354 BC, as favoured by, for instance, Buckler, or 354–353 BC, as favoured by Cawkwell.|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} by {{blood in the}} urine, can occur secondary {{to a number of}} causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the bladder wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its cause <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E
5|$|In Amenhotep I's ninth regnal year, a heliacal rise of Sothis was {{observed}} {{on the ninth}} day of the third month of summer. Modern astronomers have calculated that, if the observation was made from Memphis or Heliopolis, such an observation {{could only have been}} made on that day in 1537 BC. If the observation was made in Thebes, however, it could only have taken place in 1517 BC. The latter choice is usually accepted as correct since Thebes was the capital during the early 18th dynasty; hence, Amenhotep I is usually given an accession date in 1526 BC, although the possibility of 1546 BC <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> dismissed.|$|E

5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> {{clear why}} Burt made such an unusual will, but {{newspaper}} records suggest family feuds were likely {{at the core}} of his decision. The will was challenged by his children after he died. A legal hole was found in 1920 because part of the estate was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had a law against trusts of such long standing. This portion of the estate, amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's children and grandchildren (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters). In 1961, an additional $720,000 was taken from the trust in settlement of a suit filed by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> {{clear why}} {{secondary}} infection {{with a different}} strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It {{may be caused by}} poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for destruction. There is a suspicion that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications, and various lines of research have implied a role for T cells and soluble factors such as cytokines and the complement system.|$|E

Mahone deduces that Michael is planning to break Whistler out of the prison, and Michael eventually agrees to let him join the escape. After he begins hallucinating about Haywire, Mahone accepts heroin from T-Bag to calm himself.|$|E

5|$|Scholars usually {{agree that}} John <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> without {{historical}} value. It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His {{representation of the}} topography around Jerusalem is often superior {{to that of the}} synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, Passover, might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} next <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> clear, but Heraclius certainly won {{a crushing}} victory over Shahrbaraz {{in the fall}} of 622. The key factor was Heraclius' discovery of Persian forces hidden in ambush and responding by feigning retreat during the battle. The Persians left their cover to chase the Byzantines, whereupon Heraclius' elite Optimatoi assaulted the pursuing Persians, causing them to flee. Thus he saved Anatolia from the Persians. Heraclius had to return to Constantinople, however, to deal with the threat posed to his Balkan domains by the Avars, so he left his army to winter in Pontus.|$|E

5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
5|$|Buckler {{suggests}} the following: According to the Athenian politician Demosthenes, Kersebleptes met Philip at Maroneia (in Thrace), {{together with the}} Theban general Pammenes, and came to an agreement with Philip; furthermore, he states that Amadokos was hostile to Philip at the time. Demosthenes says that the Athenian general Chares filed the report about the meeting between Philip, Pammenes and Kersebleptes; and Polyaenus says that after Philip's Maroneia campaign, Chares ambushed Philip's fleet {{off the coast of}} Neapolis. Since it is recorded that Neapolis appealed to Athens for aid against Philip in 355 BC, it is a strong possibility that these events all took place in 355 BC. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> clear what occasioned this meeting between Philip and Kersebleptes; Buckler suggests that Philip and Kersebleptes agreed to divide Thrace between them, leaving Kersebleptes free to attack the other Thracian kings (to try to reunite the Thracian kingdom), and leaving Philip free to campaign elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Its {{population}} in Canada is limited due to both snow depth {{and the presence}} of the Canadian lynx. The bobcat does not tolerate deep snow, and waits out heavy storms in sheltered areas; it lacks the large, padded feet of the Canadian lynx and cannot support its weight on snow as efficiently. The bobcat <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>entirely</b> at a disadvantage where its range meets that of the larger felid: displacement of the Canadian lynx by the aggressive bobcat has been observed where they interact in Nova Scotia, while the clearing of coniferous forests for agriculture has led to a northward retreat of the Canadian lynx's range to the advantage of the bobcat. In northern and central Mexico, the cat is found in dry scrubland and forests of pine and oak; its range ends at the tropical southern portion of the country.|$|E
