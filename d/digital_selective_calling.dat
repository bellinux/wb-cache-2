Selcal (<b>selective</b> <b>calling)</b> controller, as {{intermediate}} equipment between selcal and radio station, {{is designed to}} achieve the software automation and remote control in aviation. The whole system adopts msp- 430 microcontroller as hardware core and C language as the method of software realization. This paper focuses on hardware connection and design to introduce the electrical design and software flow of selcal controller.. OBJECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE Selcal, also know as ground-air <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> device, {{has been used by}} land station for <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> of aircraft. Each aircraft has a unique <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code, when the <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> device calls an aircraft, the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> code, which consists of two connected audio pulse, shall be entered firstly. Two single tones that transmitted simultaneously are contained in each pulse. Selcal code will be transmitted by the shortwave radio station when the CALL push-button is pressed. When this code is received by the appropriate aircraft, the communication between radio station and aircraft is established. Therefore voice transmission connection between the ground and the aircraft can be achieved by using a handle. Fig. 1 Conventional model of <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> syste...|$|R
50|$|Tone squelch, {{or other}} forms of <b>selective</b> <b>calling,</b> is {{sometimes}} used to solve interference problems. Where more than one user is on the same channel (co-channel users), <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> addresses a subset of all receivers. Instead of turning on the receive audio for any signal, the audio turns on only {{in the presence of the}} correct <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code. This is akin to the use of a lock on a door. A carrier squelch is unlocked and will let any signal in. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> locks out all signals except ones with the correct key to the lock (the correct code).|$|R

50|$|In {{conventional}} systems, {{units are}} separated into groups by <b>selective</b> <b>calling.</b> Radios are usually segmented into customers with each customer {{on a separate}} <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code. Systems may use continuous tone-coded squelch system for this purpose. A disadvantage is that conventional systems require the user to disable <b>selective</b> <b>calling,</b> (to monitor,) {{in order to see}} if another company is talking before using the channel. Conventional systems are usually analog FM.|$|R
5000|$|A general option {{setting for}} all MDC systems is to enable or disable an {{acknowledgement}} (ack) data packet. For example, following a <b>selective</b> <b>call,</b> the called radio replies with an ack. This data [...] "handshake" [...] confirms the called radio is powered on, has received and decoded the call. The encoder beeps {{to confirm the}} call got through to the target. In computer-aided dispatch, the encoder/decoder may pass the ack to the dispatch computer system, flagging the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> as having been received by the mobile radio or automatically marking the time of call. The disadvantage of using an ack on busy channels is that more air time is used: roughly double the air time used by the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> data alone. The ack packet takes roughly {{the same amount of}} air time as the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> itself.|$|R
50|$|In a conventional, analog {{two-way radio}} system, a {{standard}} radio has noise squelch or carrier squelch which allows a radio to receive all transmissions. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{is used to}} address a subset of all two-way radios on a single radio frequency channel. Where more than one user is on the same channel, (co-channel users,) <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> can address a subset of all receivers or can direct a call to a single radio. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> features fit into two major categories: individual calling and group calling. Individual calls generally have longer time-constants: it takes more air-time to call an individual radio unit than to call {{a large group of}} radios.|$|R

50|$|In non-critical uses, <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{can also}} be used to hide the {{presence}} of interfering signals such as receiver-produced intermodulation. Receivers with poor specifications—such as inexpensive police scanners or low-cost mobile radios—cannot reject the strong signals present in urban environments. The interference will still be present. It will still degrade system performance but by using <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> the user will not have to hear the noises produced by receiving the interference.|$|R

50|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> or DSC is a {{standard}} for sending pre-defined digital messages via the medium-frequency (MF), high-frequency (HF) and very-high-frequency (VHF) maritime radio systems. It is a core part of the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS).|$|E
50|$|A GMDSS {{system may}} include {{high-frequency}} (HF) radiotelephone and radiotelex (narrow-band direct printing) equipment, with calls initiated by <b>digital</b> <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> (DSC). Worldwide broadcasts of maritime safety information {{can also be}} made on HF narrow-band direct printing channels.|$|E
5000|$|In the US, Federal Communications Commission rules require {{users of}} <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{to monitor the}} channel (i.e. switch to carrier squelch) before transmitting. In other words, the user must monitor (listen) {{to make sure the}} channel is not in use by someone on another <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code before transmitting. To enforce this rule, base {{stations}} often have a monitor switch on the microphone. The push-to-talk button is split into two segments. One segment turns the <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> off. The other segment of the button transmits. A mechanical interlock prevents the transmit button from being pressed until the monitor button is down. This is called, [...] "compulsory monitor before transmit." [...] In mobile radios, microphones are stored in a hang-up box. When the microphone is pulled out of the hang-up, the radio reverts to carrier squelch, (the <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> feature is disabled). The user automatically monitors—verifies no one else is using the channel—by pulling the mike out of the hang-up box. Hand-held radios sometimes have LED indicators that show when the channel is in use.|$|R

50|$|ALE {{evolved from}} older HF radio <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> technology. It {{combined}} existing channel-scanning <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> concepts with microprocessors (enabling FEC decoding and quality scoring decisions), burst transmissions (minimizing co-channel interference), and transponding (allowing unattended operation and incoming-call signalling). Early ALE systems {{were developed in}} the late 1970s and early 1980s by several radio manufacturers. The first ALE-family controller units were external rack mounted controllers connected to control military radios, and were rarely interoperable across vendors.|$|R
50|$|The Short Range Certificate is {{an internationally}} valid {{certificate}} issued to marine radio station operators.

50|$|An area {{within the}} {{radiotelephone}} coverage {{of at least}} one VHF coast station in which continuous <b>digital</b> <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> (Ch.70/156.525 MHz) alerting and radiotelephony services are available.

50|$|Recreational vessels do {{not need}} to comply with GMDSS radio {{carriage}} requirements, but will increasingly use the <b>Digital</b> <b>Selective</b> <b>Calling</b> (DSC) VHF radios. Offshore vessels may elect to equip themselves further. Vessels under 300 Gross tonnage (GT) are not subject to GMDSS requirements.|$|E
50|$|In uses where missed <b>calls</b> are allowable, <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{can also}} hide the {{presence}} of interfering signals such as receiver-produced intermodulation. Receivers with poor specifications—such as scanners or low-cost mobile radios—cannot reject the unwanted signals on nearby channels in urban environments. The interference will still be present and will still degrade system performance but by using <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> the user {{will not have to}} hear the noises produced by receiving the interference.|$|R
