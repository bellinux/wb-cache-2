60|$|One of the midshipmen {{followed}} the mate, and said, We were all promised that another ship should be gotten, either purchased or taken, {{and that the}} first ship we took, should be manned and victualled out of this ship, where we were <b>double</b> <b>manned,</b> and crowded together enough to bring an infection among us, in such hot climates as we are going into; and {{if we were in}} the South Seas, we should easily buy a ship, or take a ship for our purpose, almost where we would; but in all {{this part of the world}} there is no such thing as a ship fit for an Englishman to set his foot in. We were promised, too, that when we got into such a ship, we that entered as midshipmen should be preferred to offices, as we were qualified, and as our merit should recommend us. What they are going to do with us now, I cannot imagine, unless it be to turn us afore the mast, when half the foremast men are dead, and thrown overboard.|$|E
50|$|The {{lifeboat}}’s {{fourth and}} final service was on the 11 September 1903. The service was also William Bennett’s severest test. The lifeboat was launched in a gale force sea. The steam yacht Asteroid of London had already been subject to one lifeboat launch by the Blakeney lifeboat, but no help was required at that time. Now {{the crew of the}} yacht had raised a distress signal. The Wells lifeboat was already at service to another ship in Holkham Bay, and the Blakeney boat had still not returned to station. The call came to Sheringham and the lifeboat was launched into a raging sea. The lifeboat was <b>double</b> <b>manned</b> in anticipation of the heavy pulling that would be need in the blowing gale. Not long after she had been at sea, a large wave crashed over the lifeboat which tore two of her oars away. The crew rowed on until she was a mile out where she then hoisted her sails. When they reached the Asteroid two of the crew went aboard to assist the yacht whose machinery had broken down. The yacht was taken into tow and was to be taken to Great Yarmouth. Just of Sheringham the lifeboat took on supplies and the two set of for Yarmouth. By the time the lifeboat had reached Cockle lightship the yacht had managed to repair her machinery and was able to complete her journey to Yarmouth under her own steam. The lifeboat and its very tired crew returned to Sheringham in the early ours of the 12 September.|$|E
40|$|The {{project was}} {{performed}} at Kåge Sawmill {{where there was}} a need to increase the efficiency of the measurement station where wood is measured for payment and production control. The goal of the sawmill management was to optimize efficiency in measuring the cubic meter wood in the measurement station. There were also plans to make investments to increase the efficiency, which meant that the management wanted to know where the need was the greatest. The {{purpose of the study was}} to give Kåge Sawmill an estimation of the rate of the current capacity at the measurement station and provide a proposal for action to reduce stops and stock shutters. This was done during a time study of 120 hours. Using a stratified sampling method, 15 shifts were chosen which gave an idea of the availability at the measurement station. The stock shutters were monitored by random selection with the intention of finding out equipment effectiveness. The result shows that the measurement station is not used as well as it is possible. Accessibility is the greatest in the <b>double</b> <b>manned</b> mornings and the facility utilization is at its lowest at night. The overall utilization rate may be increased through investment and <b>double</b> <b>manned</b> afternoons. Investing in a control system that can be managed from within the measurement station of the crane reduces downtime by 48 hours, or 96 hours / year in the afternoon if it is also double staffed. Based on the results, a lowering of the stock shutter at about 60 cm would increase plant utilization by nearly 19 %. According to the calculations, a total utilization rate increased by 19 percentage points can be made if the changes and investments are made.
