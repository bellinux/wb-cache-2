5|$|Ahead of the 2012–13 season, Foster went {{on trial}} with League One side Sheffield United. He {{played in the}} club's opening {{pre-season}} fixture, coming on as a 62nd-minute substitute in a 1–1 draw with Ilkeston. No move materialised, and Foster signed non-contract terms with Northern Premier League Premier Division side Matlock Town to build match fitness ahead {{of a return to}} the professional game. He made his Matlock debut <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> after signing, on 18 August, playing the whole match as Matlock opened the season with a 5–0 home loss to Nantwich Town. Foster made ten appearances in all competitions for the club, leaving in October 2012.|$|E
5|$|Gert {{continued}} to move northwest after becoming a tropical storm, and reached a peak intensity of 45mph (70km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1005mbar (29.68inHg). Gert made landfall just 6miles (10km) {{to the southeast}} of Pánuco, still at peak intensity, at 10:00p.m. CDT (0000 July 25, UTC). However, due to its interaction with land, the storm quickly weakened back to a tropical depression strength early on July 25, and became a remnant low twelve hours after that.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Tzemah, the Haganah command {{realized}} {{the importance of the}} campaign in the region, and made a clear separation between the Kinarot Valley, and the Battle of Gesher fought against Transjordan and Iraq to the south. On May 18, Moshe Dayan, who had been born in Degania, was given command of all forces in the area, after having been charged with creating a commando battalion in the 8th Brigade <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> before. A company of reinforcements from the Gadna program was allocated, along with 3 PIATs. Other reinforcements {{came in the form of}} a company from the Yiftach Brigade and another company of paramilitaries from villages in the Lower Galilee and the Jezreel Valley.

5|$|In November 2010, Walker joined League Two side Stevenage on loan until January 2011. He {{made his}} club debut <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> after signing for the club, {{starting}} in Stevenage's televised FA Cup tie away at AFC Wimbledon. It {{was to be}} a scoring debut for Walker, scoring a free-kick that went in off the post to give Stevenage the lead in a 2–0 victory. He made his first league appearance for Stevenage in the club's 1–0 home loss to Northampton Town in December 2010, a game in which Walker hit the crossbar from a free-kick. Despite being due to stay at Stevenage until the beginning of January 2011, Walker was recalled by his parent club Watford on 23 December, in order to provide cover for the injured Stephen McGinn.

5|$|On 2 June 1940, he saw Marianne and Gil {{off with}} their {{chattels}} {{on a train}} to Toulouse, where his sister Guiliana lived with her husband, Duccio Tabet. On 13 June, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> before the Germans entered Paris, Pontecorvo, his brother Gillo, cousin Emilio Sereni and Salvador Luria set out for Toulouse on bicycles. It took them ten days to reach Toulouse. Luria went to Marseilles, from whence he eventually {{made his way to}} the United States. Pontecorvo, Marianna, Gil, Guiliana and Tabet boarded a train that took them to Lisbon via Madrid on 19 July 1940. Both women were pregnant. Marianne had a miscarriage, and was hardly fit to travel, but nonetheless boarded the liner Quanza on 9 August 1940 on its voyage bringing refugees to the United States. Both women were seasick. On 19 August 1940, the ship reached New York City, where they stayed with his brother Paolo. While there, he visited Fermi at his new home in Leonia, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The Tyler-Texas {{treaty was}} in its final stages when its chief architects, Secretary Upshur and Secretary of the Navy Thomas W. Gilmer, died in an {{accident}} aboard USS Princeton on February 28, 1844, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> after achieving a preliminary treaty draft agreement with the Texas Republic. The Princeton disaster proved a major setback for Texas annexation, in that Tyler expected Secretary Upshur to elicit critical support from Whig and Democratic Senators during the upcoming treaty ratification process. Tyler selected John C. Calhoun to replace Upshur as Secretary of State and to finalize the treaty with Texas. The choice of Calhoun, a highly regarded but controversial American statesman, risked introducing a politically polarizing element into the Texas debates, but Tyler prized him as a strong advocate of annexation.|$|E
5|$|Mills {{took over}} as manager of Second Division Notts County on 9 January 2004 after the {{resignation}} of Bill Dearden, with the club lying 23rd in the Second Division table. His first match in charge came <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> later, in which Marc Goodfellow scored a stoppage time winner for Bristol City as County were beaten 2–1 at home. After a run of good form from late February to early March 2004 County rose out of the relegation zone, but a run of one victory from the last 12 matches of 2003–04 saw the club relegated to League Two in 23rd place. Despite having a healthier playing budget and a reorganisation of the squad {{during the summer of}} 2004, County made a disappointing start to 2004–05. As a result, Mills was dismissed on 4 November 2004 with the club 21st in League Two, and he declined the offer of a lesser position with the club. He resumed his playing career during early 2005 with Northern Counties East League Premier Division club Glapwell, playing under Lee Wilson, who Mills had previously played with and managed.|$|E
