500|$|A little {{matter that}} seems to have been {{overlooked}} by all of you is the opportunity to beautify the design of the nickel or five cent piece during your administration, {{and it seems to me}} that it would be a permanent souvenir of a most attractive sort. [...] As possibly you are aware, it is the only coin the design of which you can change during your administration, as <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> is a law to the effect that the designs must not be changed oftener than every twenty-five years.

500|$|I {{am sorry}} to inform your Excellency that this Country has got a severe stroke {{by the loss of}} Colonel Lochry and about one hundred (tis said) of the best men of Westmoreland County, {{including}} Captain Stockely & his Company of Rangers. They were going down the Ohio on General Clarke's Expedition, many accounts agree that they were all killed or taken {{at the mouth of the}} Miame [...] River. I believe [...] chiefly killed. This misfortune, added to the failure of General Clarke's Expedition, has filled the people with great dismay. Many talk of retiring to the East side of the Mountain early in the Spring. Indeed there is great reason to apprehend that the Savages, & perhaps the British from Detroit will push us hard in the Spring, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> never were Posts—nor a Country—in a worse state of defence.|$|E

2500|$|Bryan is also {{remembered for}} his prophetic {{statement}} {{shortly after he}} became the Secretary of State in 1913: “I believe {{there will be no}} war while I am Secretary of State, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> will be no war as long as I live.” ...|$|E

2500|$|When Liu Yao died in 198 in Yuzhang Commandery (豫章郡; around present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi), Liu Ji, then 13 years old, {{presided over}} his father's funeral. He {{received}} many condolence gifts {{from those who}} attended the funeral but he declined all of them. A year later, when the warlord Sun Ce passed by Yuzhang Commandery, he collected Liu Yao's remains, arranged a proper memorial service for Liu Yao, and treated Liu Yao's family kindly. Wang Lang also advised Sun Ce to treat Liu Ji well: [...] " [...] The eldest son of Zhengli (Liu Yao) has great ambition. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> is something extraordinary about him. [...] Wouldn't it be good to treat him with kindness?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Obama {{has said}} that the death penalty is used too {{frequently}} and inconsistently. However, he favors it for cases in which [...] "the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage." [...] Speaking as a state senator about the Illinois legislature's constant additions to the list of factors that render a defendant eligible for the death penalty, Obama said, [...] "We certainly don't think that we should [...] have this laundry list that does not make any distinctions between the run-of-the-mill armed robbery that results in death and systematic killings by a terrorist organization. And I think essentially what the reduction of aggravating factors does is, it says, 'Here's a narrower set of crimes that we think potentially at least could deserve the death penalty.'" [...] In his own words, [...] "While the evidence tells me that the death penalty does little to deter crime; <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> are some crimes – mass murder, the rape and murder of a child – so heinous that the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage by meting out the ultimate punishment. On the other hand, the way capital cases were tried in Illinois at the time was so rife with error, questionable police tactics, racial bias, and shoddy lawyering, that 13 death row inmates had been exonerated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the people}} had been killed. [...] First Man said, [...] "Perhaps the Holy People will help us." [...] In the morning, he saw a dark cloud {{covering}} the top of , the Great Spruce Mountain. [...] In the night he saw a fire on the mountain. [...] He said to First Woman, [...] "Someone is there. [...] I must go to them." [...] "No," [...] she said. [...] "There are many monsters between here and there. [...] It is not safe for you." [...] The following day the dark cloud remained on the mountain, and at night the fire appeared a second time. [...] This happened the third day as well. [...] On the fourth day, First Man said, [...] "I must go. [...] <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> is a Holy Person on the mountain who can help us." [...] He set out for [...] [...] As he walked, he sang: I am , and I head for [...] in pursuit of old age and happiness.

[...] In pursuit of old age and happiness I follow the dark cloud's trail and approach the place where it is thickest. [...] In pursuit of old age and happiness I follow the scent of the rain, and approach the place where the lines of rain are darkest.|$|E
2500|$|Bruner {{has said}} that school shootings in the United States occur because {{students}} are being taught the science of evolution. Bruner wrote that [...] "Evolution is a religious philosophy with propaganda supporting the religion of Atheism". Like other Young Earth creationists, Bruner believes dinosaurs and mankind walked the Earth at the same time; Bruner also believes that scientists found proof of a young Earth but have colluded to hide the evidence. Bruner wrote: [...] "The dinosaurs on the ark may have been babies and not able to reproduce. It might make sense to take the small dinosaurs onto the ark instead of the ones bigger than a bus. After the flood, the few remaining Behemoths and Leviathans may have become extinct because {{there was not enough}} vegetation on earth for them to survive to reproductive age... When the flood waters subsided and rushed into the oceans, there was no vegetation on the earth because the earth had been covered with water." [...] A television reporter asked Bruner on-camera to clarify her beliefs concerning the biblical account of Noah's Ark and whether it was filled with pairs of animals and if the entire world was covered with water. Bruner later wrote, [...] "THE ANSWER IS STILL YES, I believe the Holy Bible. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>there</b> was a Great Flood. How do YOU explain fossils of seashells and other sea animals on tops of mountains all over the world? How do you explain the Grand Canyon? You are very naive if you believe a tiny river carved out the Grand Canyon. I believe it took a lot more water than that to carve out the Grand Canyon and other land and rock formations formed by water erosion. You can call me ignorant or intolerant or whatever you want, but I did not make fun of YOUR religion." ...|$|E
