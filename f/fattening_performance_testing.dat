Individual feed intake of the group-penned animals was recorded by electronic feeding stations during the first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth week on test. Additionally, each animal was weighted in biweekly intervalls. A second order polynomial and a third order polynomial were individually fitted on feed intake and live weight. From these curves, individual information about daily feed intake, daily gain, and food conversion ratio were derived for five periods of 12 days and for the entire period. Genetic parameters were estimated simultaneously using a multiple trait animal model. Heritabilities of h 2 =. 50,. 55,. 40, and. 39 for traits of entire test period were found for backfat thickness, daily gain, daily feed intake, and food conversion ratio, respectively. Estimated heritabilities for each test period from one to five were h 2 =. 50,. 56,. 54,. 50, and. 37 for daily gain, h 2 =. 18,. 43,. 46,. 45, and. 38 for daily feed intake, and h 2 =. 34,. 42,. 46,. 44, and. 39 for food conversion.

The highest and the lowest DMI were shown at the groups 1 and 5, respectively, however {{there was no significant difference}} between the groups 2, 3, and 4 with control. Daily weight gain (DWG) was significantly different between the groups (p< 0. 05). Group 5 had significantly lower DWG than groups 1, 2 and 3, furthermore there were no significant difference between groups 1, 2, 3 and 4. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly different among the groups (p< 0. 05). There was no significant difference among the groups 1, 2, 3 and 4. But these groups had significantly better FCR than the group 5. The best FCR was obtained for group 3. It may conclude that alfalfa hay can be substituted with SRS at 50 % level with no negative effects on Azari male buffalo calves <b>fattening</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to Figure out the effect of egg weight on hatching rate and <b>fattening</b> <b>performance</b> of partridges (A. Chuka r) reared under intensive conditions. The eggs were divided into two groups as big (=>? 20 g) and small (< 20 g), then incubated. Hatching rate for big and small groups were 75, 8 and 74. 1 %, respectively. Hatching weight for big and small groups were 14, 30, 16 and 13, 20, 16 g, respectively. All the chicks were fattened till 16 weeks of age. At the end of fattening period, average live weight of male and female partridges were 5099 and 49512 g for big and 42514 and 4219 g for small groups, respectively. Males had higher live weight than females (p< 0. 001). Egg weight affected live weight of the partridges at 2 - 4, 8 - 10 and 12 - 14 weeks of age (p< 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences between}} the groups in terms of feed consumption through fattening period. Total feed consuming for big and small groups were 2200. 7125. 3 and 2059, 436, 08 g, respectively. Differences between feed conversion ratios of the groups were not significant through fattening period. FCR was calculated as 4, 830, 27 and 4, 870, 12 for big and small groups, respectively. As a result, it could be said that egg weight is not a significant factor on hatching rate and <b>fattening</b> <b>performance</b> of the partridges...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} foreign pig breeds {{imported}} to Lithuania has increased, especially Landraces. Animals imported from other countries get into different environmental conditions. Decisions about adaptation of Danish Landraces were made when analysing {{the changes in the}} data for productivity of imported pigs and their offsprings of F 1 -F 6 generations born in Lithuania. The work was carried out in the years 1998 – 2006. Because of adaptation to new environmental conditions, litter size, litter weight of piglets at 21 days of age and survival rate percent of piglets for primaparous sows of Danish Landrace breed, born and grown in Lithuania, was improving, in comparison with imported primaparous sows. According to evaluation data analysis of the control fattening and carcass for Danish Landrace progeny born in the country, offspring of sixth generation (F 6) distinguished by the best <b>fattening</b> <b>performance.</b> However, tendency manifested, that with increasing daily gain in many cases meatiness traits of pigs are getting worse. Muscularity of F 6 Landraces was 1. 7 – 2. 9 % lower than of F 2 -F 5 progeny of this breed (P < 0. 05 – 0. 01). Therefore, when striving in the adaptation process to stabilise specific traits of Landrace pigs, especially <b>fattening</b> <b>performance</b> and meatiness, besides balanced feeding and making of good keeping conditions, it is also purposeful regularly to import boars (each 3 – 4 years) of this breed into breeding centres or to use Al stations services...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{begins by}} {{distinguishing}} between task-based <b>testing</b> and <b>performance</b> <b>testing.</b> It then provides a short historical {{overview of the}} development of performance assessment. Next, a preliminary overview of the <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> literature sketches out some of the general trends in that literature including the fact that that it already contains many (a) overviews and discussions of language <b>performance</b> <b>testing,</b> (b) many papers and books providing guidelines for developing and doing <b>performance</b> <b>testing,</b> and (c) numerous articles on the place of <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> in language curriculum. The paper then restricts itself to looking at the most productive recent areas of research on <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> with the goal of addressing the following key questions (that also serve as main headings in the paper) : 1. What happens when actual <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> are developed and validated? 2. What are the characteristics of <b>performance</b> <b>tests?</b> 3. What are the benefits of <b>performance</b> <b>testing</b> (why bother?) ? 4. What factors are involved in performance task difficulty? 5. How should we best go about scoring <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> (in terms of scoring criteria and rater effects) ? 6. Are <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> reliable? 7. Are <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> valid? 8. Are there other issues about <b>performance</b> <b>tests</b> that need to be researched? The conclusions section then extends each of the main questions into a number of as yet unanswered sub-questions that might prove useful for future research on <b>performance</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} done in order to analyze the <b>fattening</b> <b>performance</b> of Holstein cattle which are under Summer season {{conditions}} {{in the district of}} Silifke of Mersin province. A total of 56 head Holstein cattle which are in commercial cattle fattening enterprise doing intensive production were fattened by dividing them into lighter (G-I) and heavier (G-II) according to weights of per feeding. Initial weight, average daily live weight gain, finishing weight, live weights gain and feed conversion rate for G-I and G-II were 99. 03 ± 2. 32 and 205. 27 ± 5. 15, 1. 081 ± 0. 04 and 1. 108 ± 0. 04 g, 293. 68 ± 5. 74 and 404. 64 ± 6. 95 and 194. 65, 199. 37 kg and 6. 8 and 7. 1 %, respectively. The cattles were put into the enterprise in April, 2010. Both groups separated from the enterprise {{at the end of the}} 180 days fattening. Independent t-test was used in order to determine whether there was a differentiation between groups. Differences between groups in terms of initial weight and finishing weight were significant (p 0. 01). As a result, it was found that initial weight in the daily live weight gain of Holstein cattle in Summer season conditions in the district of Silifke of Mersin province was not important also it was found that cattle were affected by the temperature and humidity, cattle <b>fattening</b> <b>performance</b> was subnormal and the performance could be increased by shower and fan application...|$|R
