40|$|BACKGROUND: Aplastic anemia (AA) {{is rarely}} {{described}} after a <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> autoimmune disease (<b>aID).</b> AIMS: To assess the prevalence <b>of</b> prior <b>aID</b> {{in patients with}} AA recorded in the registry of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and to evaluate treatment and outcome. METHODS: 1, 251 AA patients from 18 EBMT centers were assessed. RESULTS: Fifty patients (4 %) were eligible: 22 males and 28 females with a median age of 46 years at the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>aID</b> and <b>of</b> 51 years at the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> AA. Information on the treatment of AA was available in 49 patients: 38 received only immunosuppressive therapy (IST), 8 patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) - 6 as first-line therapy and 2 after failure of IST - whilst 3 patients had a spontaneous recovery. After a median follow-up of 3. 19 years, 32 patients were alive, including 7 of the 8 patients who underwent HSCT. Only 6 of 32 patients who were alive at the last follow-up were receiving IST for AA. CONCLUSIONS: Most cases <b>of</b> AA following <b>aID</b> benefitted from IST or HSCT if a matched donor was available.

40|$|Autoinflammatory {{diseases}} (AID) {{are characterized}} by seemingly unprovoked self-limited attacks of fever and systemic inflammation potentially leading to amyloidosis. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) {{is the most common}} AID and therefore the most studied. Besides FMF, the other main hereditary AID are tumor necrosis factor-associated periodic fever syndrome (TRAPS), mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), and cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndrome (CAPS). These hereditary diseases result from a mutant gene that is involved in the regulation of inflammation, resulting in a characteristic clinical phenotype. The differential <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>AID</b> can be challenging due to a wide overlap in clinical manifestations. Moreover, a considerable proportion of patients present with autoinflammatory symptoms but without a pathogenetic variant on genetic analysis. Furthermore, non-hereditary AID, such as the periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome, which is the most common AID in children worldwide, must be excluded in certain circumstances.

High-grade B cell lymphomas such as Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkitt's-like lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and primary central nervous system lymphoma present more often in HIV-infected patients. These particular cancers often foreshadow a poor prognosis. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or KSHV cause many of these lymphomas.

EEG was obtained through scalp electrodes following international 10 / 20 system. Patient and their attendants were interviewed using a semi structured questionnaire. The EEG findings and clinical seizure events were then compared. Among the 767 epilepsy patients most were children (39.9 % less than 10 years old) and young adult (33.2 % in 11 – 20 years age group). Female patients predominantly had seizure than male (57 % and 43 % respectively). The overall sensitivity of EEG in yielding abnormal interictal epileptiform discharges was 62.7 %. About 48.5 % of them were diagnosed as localization related epilepsy and 11.7 % were generalized epilepsy. Morphology showed spike and wave in 74 % and sharp and wave in 11 % tracings.

40|$|Introduction: Intraperitoneal {{hemorrhage}} {{caused by}} a uterine myoma is rare (Tajima et al., 2015). Presentation of case: A 47 -year-old woman {{was admitted to the}} emergency room for worsening abdominal pain. Ultrasound revealed fluid filled almost the entire abdominal cavity as well as the presence of a mass of about 20  cm near the uterus. It was not easy {{to understand the nature of}} the fluid by ultrasound. It appeared to be ascites with a tumoral pelvic neoformation. On TC there was extravasation of contrast material, but the bleeding site was not identifiable. An emergency operation was performed. Bleeding was from a subserosalmyoma on the anterior wall of the uterus; myoma measured approximately 20  cm in maximum diameter. Pathological assessment of the resected specimen revealed bleeding from ruptured tortuous veins on a serosal-type uterine myoma. Discussion: Spontaneous rupture of a vein or an artery overlying a myoma has been documented in English literature on the subject, although it is extremely rare (Tajima et al., 2015). Conclusion: The differential diagnosis between ascites and hemoperitoneum is sometimes not easy.

DESIGN [...] Survey of continuing surveillance of voluntarily reported AIDS cases. SUBJECTS [...] 4127 adults with AIDS diagnosed during 1989 - 92 and reported to the Public Health Laboratory Service AIDS Centre. SETTING [...] England and Wales. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Lack of prolonged awareness of infection before <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>AIDS,</b> defined as an interval of nine months or less between first positive test result and <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>AIDS.</b> RESULTS [...] Of 3556 adults with known dates of first positive HIV test result and AIDS diagnosis, 1742 (49 %) had been unaware of their infection for up to nine months before AIDS was diagnosed. Lack of awareness was independently and positively associated with infection through heterosexual contact (odds ratio 4. 46, 95 % confidence interval 3. 15 to 6. 33), AIDS reported outside the Thames regions (1. 64, 1. 38 to 1. 96), and being non-white (1. 99, 1. 51 to 2. 61). Women {{were less likely to}} be unaware than men (0. 50, 0. 33 to 0. 76), and people diagnosed in 1992 were least likely to be unaware (0. 48, 0. 39 to 0. 60).

CONCLUSIONS [...] People with certain characteristics are more likely than others to be unaware of their HIV infection before AIDS is diagnosed and are therefore less likely to receive prophylaxis.

40|$|Acute {{traumatic}} {{abdominal wall}} hernia (TAWH) {{is a rare}} type of hernia that occurs after a low- or high-velocity impact of the abdominal wall against a blunt object. With few cases reported, a consensus in diagnosis and management has not been established in the literature. A systematic {{review of the literature}} for adult cases of traumatic abdominal wall hernia due to blunt abdominal trauma was undertaken. All original articles were reviewed and data were compiled and tabulated qualitatively. Diagnostic imaging modalities and their reported description of the abdominal wall hernia were detailed correlated with the laparotomy findings. We also report a case of TAWH following blunt abdominal trauma, and describe integration of this management into clinical practice. Fifty-five cases of adult TAWH were found in the English literature. Most hernias contained either small bowel (69 %) or large bowel (36 %), with 16 % of TAWH containing both. Concurrent intra-abdominal injuries were seen in 60 % of cases, with an almost equal number of associated bowel (44 %) and solid organ (35 %) injuries. Twenty percent <b>of</b> <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> TAWH was delayed, ranging from 2 days to 9 years.
