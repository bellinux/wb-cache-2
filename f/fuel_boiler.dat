40|$|SCA Obbola AB is a {{kraft pulp}} mill that {{produces}} and sells packaging paper. The steam demand {{is covered by}} a recovery boiler and a solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> (consists of two parallel solid fuel furnaces and a boiler). Adjustments in steam production are foremost made by the solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler.</b> Previously made energy-reducing measures at the mill has lowered the steam demand which forces the solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> to low steam production. The solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> produces over 25 GWH/year and is therefor bound by the Swedish nitrous oxide charge, but is also restricted to a monthly mean value of 70 mg/MJ. This mean value was exceeded in July 2016, which {{is thought to be}} a result of forced limitation in steam production. NOx emissions are reduced secondarily by an urea-based SNCR-system where its efficiency depends on several parameters, foremost sufficiently high flue gas temperatures. This work has identified parameters that effects foremost hydrogen-based combustion emission from the solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler.</b> This was achieved by evaluating historical data and by conducting tests during operation of the solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler,</b> which was planned and evaluated using a software called MODDE. Emission reducing measures and recommended ways to operate the boiler was then presented from the collected data. Practical measures including down-winding supply machinery of secondary air and replacement of urea injection showed no tendencies in reducing NOx emissions. However, complete shut down of one the furnaces produced at least 100 °C higher flue gas temperatures produced from the active furnace. Low NOx emissions was noted when secondary air was supplied from machinery with original speed. therefor, during stretched periods with low steam production, it's recommended that: Only one furnace should be active as steam producer, urea should be injected at its original placement in the flue gas chamber close the furnace and that secondary air should be supplied by machinery with original speed. Comparison test made in this work showed that this way of operating the solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> could reduce NOx emissions with 45 % compared to mean NOx emissions at low steam production in July 2016...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to develop the {{knowledge}} about nonlinear and/or adaptive solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> control at Vattenfall Utveckling AB. The aim is also to make a study of implemented and published control strategies. A solid <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> is a large-scale heat (and power) generating plant. The Idbäcken boiler studied in this work, is a one hundred MW furnace mainly fired with wood chips. The control system consists of several linear PID controllers working together, and the furnace is a nonlinear system. That, {{and the fact that}} the fuel-flow is not monitored, are the main reasons for the control problems. The system fluctuates periodically and the CO outlets sometimes rise high above the permitted level. There is little work done in the area of advanced boiler control, but some interesting approaches are described in scientific articles. MPC (Model Predictive Control), nonlinear system identification using ANN (Artificial Neural Network), fuzzy logic, Hµ loop shaping and MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) PID tuning methods have been tested with good results. Both linear and nonlinear system identification is performed in the thesis. The linear models are able to explain about forty percent of the system behavior and the nonlinear models explain about sixty to eighty percent. The main result is that nonlinear models improve the performance and that there are considerable disturbances complicating the identification. Another identification issue was the feedback during the data collection...|$|E

30|$|In Pulverized <b>fuel</b> <b>boiler</b> system, {{powdered}} coal is {{used for}} combustion, out of which 2 % is nearly of +  30 microns size and 70 – 75 % is below 75 microns. A different variety of coal {{can be used in}} these types of boilers. In pulverized boilers, coal is reduced to a fine powder with the help of grinding mills and projected into combustion chamber with the help of hot air current. Pre-heated air from PA fan helps the coal to flow from the bowl mill to the boiler. A fire ball is created when the coal is fired inside the furnace where the temperature rises up to 1300 – 1700  °C. About 90 % of the coal power plants use these types of boilers for power generation [4, 23]. Small proportion of wood, biomass and agricultural materials can also be used as fuel in pulverized fuel boilers [24].|$|E
