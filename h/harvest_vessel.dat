40|$|ObjectiveEndoscopic vein {{harvesting}} systems {{have grown in}} popularity and are becoming {{the gold standard for}} coronary artery bypass grafting. Although a consensus is present that endoscopic <b>vessel</b> <b>harvesting</b> minimizes wound complications, long-term graft patency remains a concern. It has been proposed that endoscopic <b>vessel</b> <b>harvesting</b> affects graft patency because of irreversible trauma to the endothelium. This study was performed to examine the extent of thermal injury caused by 2 commercially available endoscopic <b>vessel</b> <b>harvesting</b> systems in a porcine model. MethodsSuperficial epigastric veins and saphenous arteries were exposed in 10 anesthetized swine. All vessel samples (conduits) were harvested randomly with either a VirtuoSaph (Terumo Cardiovascular, Ann Arbor, Mich) or VASOVIEW 6 (MAQUET, Inc, Wayne, NJ) endoscopic <b>vessel</b> <b>harvesting</b> system. Conduits were harvested and saved for either histologic analysis or burst-pressure test. Statistical differences were analyzed by using a Wilcoxon rank sum test in SAS 9. 2 software (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) for thermal spread and a 2 -tailed t test with equal variance for burst pressure. ResultsThe average thermal spreads for saphenous artery and superficial epigastric vein conduits were significantly shorter in the VirtuoSaph group (0. 42 ± 0. 08 and 0. 49 ± 0. 05 mm, respectively) than in the VASOVIEW 6 group (1. 05 ±. 04 and 0. 94 ± 0. 19 mm, respectively). No significant differences were observed in burst pressure. ConclusionsThe length of thermal spread is short in arterial and venous conduits (0. 4 – 1. 1 mm) and depends on the endoscopic <b>vessel</b> <b>harvesting</b> system.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effects of currently used solutions on endothelium-dependent relaxation after short-term storage of vessels at room temperature or at 4 degrees C. The infrarenal rat aorta was selected for study because its use enabled standardization of the investigation, which was performed in organ baths on 672 vessel segments from 112 Sprague-Dawley rats. Stable vasoconstriction was obtained with the thromboxane analogue U- 46619. Acetylcholine was used to elicit endothelium-dependent relaxation.

Endothelium-independent relaxation, tested with papaverine, was unaffected in all groups. Ringer's lactate, Krebs solution, and Perfadex (a low-potassium-dextran-glucose solution) did not significantly affect endothelium-dependent relaxation either at room temperature or at 4 degrees C, although a tendency to impaired relaxation was seen in these three groups after cold storage. Standard Ringer's solution and fresh heparinized blood each significantly reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation in vessels stored at room temperature (p < 0. 05), but not in those stored at 4 degrees C.

40|$|ObjectivesEndothelial {{disruption}} within {{saphenous vein}} and radial artery grafts increases thrombosis risk. However, no clinically applicable method for imaging the intima currently exists. We used a novel infrared imaging technology, {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT; LightLab Imaging, Inc, Westford, Mass), to visualize the intima within harvested conduits. MethodsConduits were procured endoscopically (37 saphenous vein grafts and 8 radial artery grafts) or with the open technique (9 radial artery grafts) from 50 patients. Surplus segments were analyzed by means of OCT for evidence of preexisting pathology or traumatic injury. Focal plaques in radial artery grafts and the intimal hyperplasia area in saphenous vein grafts were quantified as having an intimal/medial thickness ratio of greater than 0. 5. Biopsy specimens were obtained for histologic confirmation and to analyze matrix metalloproteinase 2 levels (saphenous vein grafts) and prostacyclin/nitric oxide metabolites (radial artery grafts). Interobserver κ coefficients and a Bland–Altman analysis {{were used to determine}} the reproducibility and accuracy of OCT interpretations. ResultsRadial artery imaging revealed plaque in 76 %. Endoscopically <b>harvested</b> <b>vessels</b> showed intraluminal clot (38 %) and intimal tears ranging from severe (6 %) to mild (88 %). In saphenous vein grafts intimal thickening was detected in 86 % and intraluminal clotting in 68 %. The intimal/medial thickness ratio determined by means of OCT correlated directly with matrix metalloproteinase 2 levels (R = 0. 6804) in saphenous vein grafts and inversely with metabolites of prostacyclin (R = − 0. 55) and nitric oxide (R = − 0. 58) in radial artery grafts. OCT imaging was reproducible (interobserver κ coefficients of > 0. 81 for the characterization of plaque types) and showed a strong correlation with histology (R = 0. 8, P <. 001).

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{use of the}} {{saphenous vein}} in {{coronary}} artery bypass graft surgery is associated with high 1 -year occlusion rates of as much as 30 %. A new “no-touch” technique of saphenous vein harvesting in which the vein is harvested with a pedicle of surrounding tissue and not distended may result in improved early patency rates. We hypothesize that nitric oxide synthase is better preserved with the no-touch technique, and the aim of this study was the investigation of whether nitric oxide synthase distribution and quantity in saphenous veins harvested with the no-touch technique differ from those veins harvested with the conventional technique. The separate contribution of perivascular tissue removal and distension to alterations in nitric oxide synthase was also studied. Methods: Segments of 10 saphenous veins were harvested from 10 patients who underwent {{coronary artery bypass graft}}ing surgery with the no-touch and conventional techniques. Samples were also taken from segments that were stripped of surrounding tissue but not distended. Nitric oxide synthase distribution was studied with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate–diaphorase histochemistry, and staining was quantified with image analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used for the identification of specific nitric oxide synthase isoforms, and immunomarkers were used for the identification of associated cell types. Results: Nitric oxide synthase content was higher in no-touch vessels as compared with conventionally <b>harvested</b> <b>vessels</b> (35. 5 %; P <. 05, with analysis of variance). This content was associated with endothelial nitric oxide synthase on the lumen while all three isoforms were present in the media. In the intact adventitia of no-touch vessels, all three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase were also present, associated with microvessels and perivascular nerves. Perivascular tissue stripping and venous distension both contribute to the reduced nitric oxide synthase in conventionally harvested veins. Conclusion: The new no-touch technique of saphenous vein harvesting preserves nitric oxide synthase, which suggests that improved nitric oxide availability may be an important mechanism in the success of this technique.

Methods: NOD mice were grouped according to glycosuria levels as NODI: none; NODII: high; NODIII: severe. Linagliptin treatment was initiated once they reached NODII levels. Vascular reactivity was assessed ex vivo on aorta harvested from mice upon reaching NODIII level. In a separate set of experiments, {{the effect of}} linagliptin was tested directly in vitro on <b>vessels</b> <b>harvested</b> from untreated NODIII, glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) receptor knockout and soluble guanylyl cyclase-α 1 knockout mice. Molecular and cellular studies were performed on endothelial and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) -transfected cells. Results: In this ex vivo vascular study, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was ameliorated and eNOS/nitric oxide (NO) /soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) signalling was enhanced. In the in vitro vascular study, linagliptin exerted a direct vasodilating activity on <b>vessels</b> <b>harvested</b> from both normo- or hyperglycaemic mice. The effect was independent from GLP- 1 /GLP- 1 receptor (GLP- 1 R) interaction and required eNOS/NO/sGC pathway activation.
