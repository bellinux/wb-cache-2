25|$|In asexual reproduction, an {{organism}} can reproduce without {{the involvement of}} another organism. Asexual reproduction {{is not limited to}} single-celled organisms. The cloning of {{an organism}} is a form of asexual reproduction. By asexual reproduction, an organism creates a genetically similar or identical copy of itself. The evolution of sexual reproduction is a major puzzle <b>for</b> <b>biologists.</b> The two-fold cost of sexual reproduction is that only 50% of organisms reproduce and organisms only pass on 50% of their genes.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} many {{tangible}} benefits <b>for</b> <b>biologists.</b> For example, a researcher investigating a certain {{form of cancer}} may have narrowed down their search to a particular gene. By visiting the human genome database on the World Wide Web, this researcher can examine what other scientists have written about this gene, including (potentially) the three-dimensional structure of its product, its function(s), its evolutionary relationships to other human genes, or to genes in mice or yeast or fruit flies, possible detrimental mutations, interactions with other genes, body tissues in which this gene is activated, and diseases associated with this gene or other datatypes. Further, {{deeper understanding of the}} disease processes at the level of molecular biology may determine new therapeutic procedures. Given the established importance of DNA in molecular biology and its central role in determining the fundamental operation of cellular processes, it is likely that expanded knowledge in this area will facilitate medical advances in numerous areas of clinical interest that may not have been possible without them.|$|E

25|$|Intra-hybridization between {{dogs and}} other {{subspecies}} of gray wolves {{are the most}} common wolfdogs since dogs and gray wolves are considered the same species, are genetically very close, and have shared vast portions of their ranges for millennia. Such hybridization in the wild have been detected in many populations scattered throughout Europe and North America, usually occurring in areas where wolf populations have declined from human impacts and persecutions. At the same time, hybrids are also often bred in captivity for various purposes. Inter-hybridization of dogs and two other North American wolf species have also occurred historically in the wild, although it is often difficult <b>for</b> <b>biologists</b> to discriminate the dog genes in the eastern timber and red wolves from the gray wolf genes also present in these wolf species due to their historical overlaps with North American gray wolves as well as with coyotes, both of which have introgressed into the eastern timber and red wolf gene pools. At the same time, because many isolated populations of the three wolf species in North America have also mixed with coyotes in the wild, it has been speculated by some biologists that some of the coywolf hybrids in the northeastern third of the continent may also have both coydogs and wolfdogs in their gene pool. Hybrids between dogs and Ethiopian wolves discovered in the Ethiopian Highlands likely originated from past interactions between free-roaming feral dogs and Ethiopian wolves living in isolated areas.|$|E

500|$|Eakin {{was known}} for his {{research}} of animal eyes and photoreceptor cells, especially the parietal eye (the so-called [...] "third eye") and associated pineal gland of vertebrates. He was persuaded to study the parietal eyes of reptiles by his colleague Robert C. Stebbins, and the two published several articles on the parietal eye of western fence lizards. Eakin, alone or with colleagues, published many other papers on the anatomy and function of reptilian parietal eyes and similar structures in amphibians. Eakin's 1973 monograph, The Third Eye, was received as comprehensive and detailed enough <b>for</b> <b>biologists,</b> yet in a style approachable to non-scientists or undergraduates. He also studied amphibian development and was recognized as a skilled and early practitioner of electron microscopy. Eakin received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1953, and the Boston Museum of Science's Walker Prize in 1976. He authored or co-authored over 200 scientific papers, was elected president of the Western Society of Naturalists in 1949 and American Society of Zoologists in 1975, and was a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences for 52 years.|$|E
500|$|Microbial mats of coexisting {{bacteria}} and archaea were the dominant {{form of life}} in the early Archean and many of the major steps in early evolution are thought to have taken place within them. The evolution of [...] photosynthesis, around 3.5 Ga, eventually led to a buildup of its waste product, oxygen, in the atmosphere, leading to the great oxygenation event, beginning around 2.4 Ga. The earliest evidence of eukaryotes (complex cells with organelles) dates from 1.85 Ga, and while they may have been present earlier, their diversification accelerated when they started using oxygen in their metabolism. Later, around 1.7 Ga, multicellular organisms began to appear, with differentiated cells performing specialised functions. Sexual reproduction, which involves the fusion of male and female reproductive cells (gametes) to create a zygote in a process called fertilization is, in contrast to asexual reproduction, the primary method of reproduction {{for the vast majority of}} macroscopic organisms, including almost all eukaryotes (which includes animals and plants). However the origin and evolution of sexual reproduction remain a puzzle <b>for</b> <b>biologists</b> though it did evolve from a common ancestor that was a single celled eukaryotic species.|$|E

2500|$|The Pampas deer of {{southern}} Argentina once were very abundant but now considered a threatened species by the IUCN. [...] The IUCN separates the subspecies O. b. celer in southern Argentina as endangered. [...] The diseases that particularly plague O. b. celer are gut parasites {{and food and}} mouth diseases. [...] Their overall decline {{is due in part}} from hunting and poaching, but also from habitat loss due to agriculture, diseases from domesticated and feral livestock, competition from more recently introduced wildlife, and general over-exploitation. There is less than 1% of their natural habitat left that was present in 1900. The deer in Argentina and Uruguay have no natural predators. They used to be the prey of cougars and jaguars. Those in Brazil still have cougars to fear. Some areas of population loss are easily tracked to poaching because of the few number of deer in an area. In the mid-1970s, 10 individuals out of a group of 16 located in Punta Medanos were killed by poachers. [...] The rest were wiped out by extensive human activity. [...] Lack of funding and technology have made it difficult <b>for</b> <b>biologists</b> to track and help the deer population, but donations and grants from organizations and universities in the United States have helped immensely with the situation. [...] In 1975, there were less than 100 of subspecies O. b. celer, but by 1980 there were 400. [...] The population has been continuing to increase, although not at that high of a rate. [...] Some of the discrepancy {{is due to the fact}} that later they found groups they did not know existed.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{most species}} in the {{crocodilians}} family, saltwater crocodiles are not fastidious in their choice of food, and readily vary their prey selection according to availability, nor are they voracious, as {{they are able to}} survive on relatively little food for a prolonged period. Because of their size and distribution, saltwater crocodiles hunt the broadest range of prey species of any modern crocodilian. The diet of hatchling, juvenile and subadult saltwater crocodiles has been subject to extensively greater scientific study than that of fully-grown crocodiles, in large part due to the aggression, territoriality and size of adults which make them difficult <b>for</b> <b>biologists</b> to handle without significant risk to safety, for both humans and the crocodiles themselves; the main method used for capturing adult saltwater crocodiles is a huge pole with large hooks meant for shark capture which restrict the crocodile's jaws but can cause damage to their snouts and even this is unproven to allow successful capture for crocodiles in excess of [...] While for example 20th century biological studies rigorously cataloged the stomach contents of [...] "sacrificed" [...] adult Nile crocodiles in Africa, few such studies were done on behalf of saltwater crocodiles despite the plethora that were slaughtered due to the leather trade during that time period. Therefore, the diet of adults {{is more likely to be}} based on reliable eye-witness accounts. Hatchlings are restricted to feeding on smaller animals, such as small fish, frogs, insects and small aquatic invertebrates. In addition to these prey, juveniles also take a variety of freshwater and saltwater fish, various amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs, such as large gastropods and cephalopods, birds, small to medium-sized mammals, and other reptiles, such as snakes and lizards. When crocodiles obtain a length of more than , the significance of small invertebrate prey fades in favor of small vertebrates including fish and smaller mammals and birds. The larger the animal grows, the greater the variety of its diet, although relatively small prey are taken throughout its lifetime.|$|E
