5|$|Fender fielded mainly at slip. He possessed quick {{reactions}} and could {{move quickly to}} catch balls <b>hit</b> <b>some</b> distance from him. His technique was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the ball with one leg stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics regarded {{him as one of}} the best slip fielders in England.|$|E
5|$|In Pune, {{where the}} {{construction}} industry was badly <b>hit,</b> <b>some</b> local organisations, working for porters, construction workers and casual labourers, {{tried to stop the}} exodus. These organisations set up a National Integration Committee (NIC) and charted out confidence-building measures among the migrants in the city. One of the resolutions passed at the meeting was to encourage participation of the North Indians in all festivities in the near future. In fact, ninety percent of the labour force in Pune consists of migrants; 60percent of these come from Bihar and UP. It was also feared that the stoppage of construction activities would adversely affect the plans of hosting certain events of the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games to be held in the city.|$|E

5|$|No. 100 Group {{were searching}} for intruders in force by 01:30, at which time the intruders had already spent 90 minutes over England. Several Ju 88s were chased out to sea and two were claimed as shot down. Three Ju 88s crashed while making ground attacks on targets of opportunity. Leo Zimmermann of NJG 5 {{attempted}} to attack an Air Transport Command B-24 using his Schräge Musik but was spotted. Evasive action by the pilot avoided an attack and the Ju 88 was seen to crash into the ground after its wing tip made contact with the runway. Eight minutes later Heinrich Conze, also of NJG 5, attempted to attack a car driven by Royal Observer Corps member Mr J P Kelway. The Ju 88 struck power lines as it attacked and crashed into the car killing Kelway and the German crew. Over Pocklington Johann Dreher and his crew attempted to attack a landing Halifax and then a taxi that had its headlights on and was travelling along a parallel road near the airfield. Dreher <b>hit</b> <b>some</b> trees as he dived to low-level and all aboard were killed. The crews had {{the distinction of being}} the last German airmen to crash on British soil during the war.|$|E

He <b>hit</b> <b>some</b> form in the Twenty20 match that followed, top scoring with his highest score in that format, 60*, as England won by nine wickets. He then adopted the opening position for the following ODI series, however his form was intermittent with scores of 46, 0, 20, and 46.|$|E
25|$|Lange and Douglas {{engaged in}} a rapid program of {{deregulation}} {{and the removal of}} tariffs and subsidies. The first sector affected was New Zealand's agricultural community, a traditionally National-supporting community. The loss of subsidies <b>hit</b> <b>some</b> farmers hard. Other changes brought criticism from many people in Labour's traditional supporter base. The Labour Party also lost support from many elderly people by introducing a superannuation surcharge after having promised not to reduce superannuation.|$|E
25|$|Late on day 1, Pakistan {{began their}} reply confidently, and their fourth opening {{partnership}} {{combination of the}} series {{proved to be the}} most successful one. Hafeez <b>hit</b> <b>some</b> good shots before retiring hurt with a knee problem. He would return to complete his innings and score 95, while Farhat scored 91. England's poor first day was complete when they dropped Mohammad Yousuf twice before he reached double figures. He went on to score 128, his third century of the series.|$|E

Sony re-registered the trademark, noting that lack of a renewal was an administrative oversight, and the game was still in development.|$|E
25|$|The {{series of}} severe winter events started on 10 January {{when a large}} dome of cold air enveloped most parts of China, causing much {{precipitation}} {{in the form of}} heavy snow west of the coastal areas, where the temperature was dropped to slightly below 0°C (32°F). The provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui and the municipality of Shanghai were hardest <b>hit.</b> <b>Some</b> received their worst snow storms in seventeen years while some experienced their worst in five decades. After the first wave of precipitation had passed through, snow continued to fall throughout several days following, accompanied by bitterly cold weather.|$|E
25|$|On the {{previous}} day, {{the governor of}} New York had {{decided to use the}} National Guard and the New York State Department of Transportation (NYDOT) to help clean up snow in the City of Buffalo, not knowing a blizzard would <b>hit.</b> <b>Some</b> NYDOT equipment had arrived in Buffalo while the National Guard was not yet mobilized, but a meeting was being held at the Buffalo city garage that morning to coordinate the efforts. Before the meeting finished, Buffalo city plows started to return to the garage {{due to a lack of}} visibility; they reported they were unable to see even their own plow blades. By 11:30 am, most workers in the City of Buffalo had been released early, but few made it home. At 11:35 am, lightning was seen in the darkening sky.|$|E

25|$|The {{first use}} of gas by the British was at the Battle of Loos, 25 September 1915, but the attempt was a disaster. Chlorine, codenamed Red Star, was the agent to be used (140 tons arrayed in 5,100 cylinders), and the attack was {{dependent}} on a favorable wind. However, on this occasion the wind proved fickle, and the gas either lingered in no man's land or, in places, blew back on the British trenches. This debacle was compounded when the gas could not be released from all the British canisters because the wrong turning keys were sent with them. Subsequent retaliatory German shelling <b>hit</b> <b>some</b> of those unused full cylinders, releasing more gas among the British troops. Exacerbating the situation were the primitive flannel gas masks distributed to the British. The masks got hot, and the small eye-pieces misted over, reducing visibility. Some of the troops lifted the masks to get some fresh air, causing them to be gassed.|$|E
25|$|Iqbal's first ODI {{was against}} Sri Lanka, {{a game in}} which the whole Pakistani batting line-up capitulated. He showed that he {{preferred}} to take his time to get settled {{in the middle of the}} pitch. Because of that, the selectors chose to give him his first Test match start soon after. He started his International test career during Pakistan's tour of New Zealand where he played multiple strong innings in which he displayed his range of strokes and the ability to play off some hostile bowling. Iqbal was a prolific junior-level scorer. He played two Tests in South Africa in 2003–04 but was dropped after not performing well. Upon returning to Test cricket after a two-year hiatus, he scored his maiden Test century against India to help Pakistan win the 2005–06 Test series in the final Test in Karachi. He proved his doubters wrong by playing some solid innings especially an impressive innings against Australia which turned out to be in vain as it did not prevent a loss. He continued on for a few more tours but was ultimately dropped due to a lean period where he did not contribute significantly with the bat. He continued to play domestic cricket though and was recalled to the side after injuries <b>hit</b> <b>some</b> of the other players.|$|E
25|$|After {{a string}} of four minor games the MCC played South Australia {{on either side of}} Christmas, with Christmas Day and Boxing Day being rest days. Les Favell won the toss and batted. Lynn Marks and Les Cunningham were out for ducks, but Favell (40) added 58 for the second wicket with Ian Chappell (59), {{followed}} by Brian Shiell who made his highest First Class score of 202 not out, adding 146 with Barry Jarman (70), 51 with George Griffiths (23) and 129 with David Sincock (28 not out) when Favell declared at 459/5 at lunch on the second day. Chappell caught Geoff Boycott for a duck and with Peter Parfitt out for 6 the MCC were 13/2 before Bob Barber (46) and Colin Cowdrey (18) added 53 for the third wicket. M.J.K. Smith made 108, adding 136 with Ken Barrington (63), while John Murray (110) and Fred Titmus (79) put together 164 for the eight wicket. The MCC's 444 nearly matched South Australia's score and Favell set about making runs for a declaration, Ian Chappell hitting 113 not out as they rattled up 253/4 in 249 minutes. Left to make 269 runs in three hours the MCC responded in kind, Boycott (58) and Barber (77) made 138 for the first wicket, Cowdrey made 63 not out and the all rounder Barry Knight (46) was promoted up the order so that he could <b>hit</b> <b>some</b> quick runs. The tourists made 270/4 and won a good-natured match by 6 wickets.|$|E
5000|$|GamePro {{gave the}} game a {{negative}} review, {{saying that the}} premise is compelling but marred by too many poorly-designed segments. They summarized the game as [...] "a movie-like trek that has great ambiance but <b>hits</b> <b>some</b> sticky spots along the way." ...|$|R

500|$|In England's chase, Trott was {{the only}} batsman dismissed, run out for 19, {{although}} replays suggested that it was possibly the wrong decision. Cook scored his second century of the series, and Pietersen finished on 74, scored at just under a run-a-ball. Bangladesh's bowling attack was tired, and rarely threatened England; Pietersen even opted to switch <b>hit</b> <b>some</b> deliveries. In Wisden, Hopps, who had described the second morning as being possibly [...] "England's lowest point of a long winter", contrastingly said of the final day; [...] "England's supremacy had rarely looked so marked."
