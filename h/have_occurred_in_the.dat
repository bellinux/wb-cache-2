5|$|A {{series of}} glaciations further {{modified}} the region starting about 2 to 3 {{million years ago}} and ending sometime around 10,000 BP. At least four major glaciations <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sierra Nevada, locally called the Sherwin (also called the pre-Tahoe), Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga. The Sherwin glaciers were the largest, filling Yosemite and other valleys, while later stages produced much smaller glaciers. A Sherwin-age glacier was almost surely responsible for the major excavation and shaping of Yosemite Valley and other canyons in the area.|$|E
5|$|Alberto {{produced}} {{winds of}} tropical storm force along the South Carolina coastline; the highest official wind gust was 51mph (82km/h) at Edisto Beach. The storm dropped precipitation {{across much of}} the state, including a state maximum of 4.42inches (112mm) at Pritchardville. Storm tides reached 7.81feet (2.4m) above the mean low-level water mark along Fripp Island, leading to some beach erosion along portions of the coastline. While in the process of becoming extratropical, the rainbands of Alberto spawned seven confirmed tornadoes in the state, most of which rated F0; a National Weather Service report indicated additional tornadoes may <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state. The tornadoes caused some minor damage, though overall damage in the state was minimal.|$|E

His offence was listed as 'ultimo' (<b>having</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous month) when it should have been cited as 'instant' (<b>having</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same month).

5|$|Although Mars has no {{evidence}} of a structured global magnetic field, observations show that parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, suggesting that alternating polarity reversals of its dipole field <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory, published in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005 (with the help of the Mars Global Surveyor), is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.|$|E

The only Pacific hurricanes to strike Mexico at a greater intensity were Patricia of 2015 and Madeline of 1976. Kenna is the third most intense October tropical cyclone to <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East Pacific, and is the fourth most intense East Pacific hurricane on record, behind Hurricane Patricia of 2015, Hurricane Linda of 1997 and Hurricane Rick of 2009.|$|E

Khrushchev again served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province. Khrushchev biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to Moscow to balance the influence of Georgy Malenkov and security chief Lavrentiy Beria, who were widely seen as Stalin's heirs.|$|E

5|$|The Sivakasi {{municipality}} {{was established}} in 1920.

It was promoted to a second-grade municipality in 1978, first-grade in 1978, selection-grade in 1998 and special-grade in 2013. Over the decades after independence, Sivakasi grew as an industrial town specialising in firecracker, match and printing industries.
