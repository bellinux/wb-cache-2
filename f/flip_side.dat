5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The <b>flip</b> <b>side</b> to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E

25|$|Although it is {{believed}} that the custom of providing royal hostages to the Romans may have commenced sometime {{during the first half of}} the 1st century BC, it was certainly occurring by Octavianus's reign and it continued to be practised during the late pre-Roman period. On the <b>flip</b> <b>side,</b> ancient sources have attested to the presence of Roman merchants and artisans in Dacia, while the region also served as a haven for runaway Roman slaves. This cultural and mercantile exchange saw the gradual spread of Roman influence throughout the region, most clearly seen in the area around the Orăştie Mountains.|$|E
25|$|Reasoning {{efficiency}}. This {{refers to}} the run time efficiency of the system. The ability {{of the knowledge base}} to be updated and the reasoner to develop new inferences in a reasonable period of time. In some ways this is the <b>flip</b> <b>side</b> of expressive adequacy. In general the more powerful a representation, the more it has expressive adequacy, the less efficient its automated reasoning engine will be. Efficiency was often an issue, especially for early applications of knowledge representation technology. They were usually implemented in interpreted environments such as Lisp which were slow compared to more traditional platforms of the time.|$|E

On March 21, 1998, California's Great America opened a ride known simply as Invertigo. On April 17, 1999, Face/Off opened at Kings Island.

25|$|On the <b>flip</b> <b>side,</b> the {{disaster}} {{has made the}} port the deepest on the east coast. A bathymetry {{survey conducted by the}} National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) to measure the depth of the sea has revealed the entry channel to the port has deepened enabling the berthing of vessels of deeper drafts. The high current generated by the tsunami waves dredged about 0.4 to 0.5 million cubic metres of sediments, which has deepened the 17.4m-deep harbour by 1 to 2m more, especially along the Dr. Ambedkar Dock and the Barathi Dock. Similarly, the depth of the entry channel, which was 18.6m, has deepened by a metre.|$|E
25|$|Social {{networking}} {{sites have}} recently showed a value {{in social and}} political movements. In the Egyptian revolution, Facebook and Twitter both played an allegedly pivotal role in keeping people connected to the revolt. Egyptian activists have credited social networking sites with providing a platform for planning protest and sharing news from Tahrir Square in real time. By presenting a platform for thousands of people to instantaneously share videos of mainly events featuring brutality, social networking can be a vital tool in revolutions. On the <b>flip</b> <b>side,</b> social networks enable government authorities to easily identify, and repress, protestors and dissidents. Another thing that social media helps with in political applications is getting the younger generations involved in politics and ongoing political issues.|$|E
25|$|Activity is {{preferable}} to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, post-industrial society, which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack {{of a desire to}} do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the <b>flip</b> <b>side,</b> some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to themselves and others, such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.|$|E

25|$|The yard's slow {{work after}} the war was a symptom of having a glut of extra ships that were {{available}} for the United States Merchant Marine. The passage of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 meant that ships could be sold {{for as little as}} $ (equivalent to roughly $ in today's dollars) per deadweight ton. The <b>flip</b> <b>side</b> of this glut of ships was that there was a prediction that in 1961, more ships would be need to be constructed. This was evidenced by the fact that in 1954, there were orders for five tankers, one fleet oiler, and five destroyers. The next year, the yard attempted {{to become part of the}} building of the Forrestal-class aircraft carriers when Bethlehem objected to the awarding of the contracts to the Newport News Shipbuilding and the New York Naval Yard. Although the company pointed out that it had produced many carriers during World War II, Newport News pointed out that the company never requested an improvement of its shipbuilding facilities by the government during the war, which hampered its future bidding of aircraft carrier construction. That it had not built a single carrier since the end of the war also hurt its chances. The yard was later rewarded four frigates to build instead.|$|E

500|$|On the <b>flip</b> <b>side,</b> the 2003 song [...] "Life Got Cold" [...] by UK girl band Girls Aloud {{received}} attention due to {{similarities between the}} guitar riff and melody of [...] "Life Got Cold" [...] {{and that of the}} song [...] "Wonderwall".

Usually about a dozen for days play list. Rather than have a computerized auto selection system picking the material, he said he would rather pick records that were wrong than be right dull. One of his aims was to give the youngsters a more exiting, literate type of music. He would occasionally slip in some big band type music such as Lionel Hampton or Henry Mancini. Sometimes he would play the <b>flip</b> <b>sides</b> of singles which had local viewers playing both sides of the record.|$|R

40|$|Editor's introductionA {{barrage of}} mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&As) in the seed industry, executed by a few large biotechnology and agrochemical companies at sensational prices, has attracted much attention {{over the last three}} years. These M&As have coincided with the commercial introduction of first generation agrobiotechnology products which have been adopted at unprecedented rates. For some, the lofty acquisition prices and high adoption rates have raised expectations about the prospect value of agrobiotechnology. For others, the M&As have raised concerns about increasing market concentration and power. Interestingly, issues of value and structure are just the <b>flip</b> <b>sides</b> of the same coin. The introduction of new value possibilities in a supply chain tends to set in motion entrepreneurial efforts that typically result in structural change. After fifteen years in the making, agrobiotechnology has demonstrated that it can deliver value and has begun to have meaningful structural impacts on the agrifood chain...|$|R
