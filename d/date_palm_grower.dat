30|$|Increasing food {{production}} to feed its rapidly growing population {{is a major}} policy goal of Pakistan. The production of traditional staples such as rice (Oryza sativa L.) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has been intensified in many regions, but not in remote, drought-ridden areas. In these arid, marginal environments dates and their by-products are an option to complement staples given their high nutritive value and storability. To fill knowledge gaps {{about the role of}} <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> in the household (HH) income of rural communities and the structure of date value chains, this project studied <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> production across six districts in four provinces of Pakistan. During 2012 – 2013 a total of 170 HHs were interviewed with a structured questionnaire using a snowball sampling approach. The results showed that most of the HH were headed by males (99  %) who were married (74  %) and often illiterate (40  %). Agriculture was the main occupation of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>growers</b> (56  %), while a few coupled agricultural activities with business (17  %) or extra-farm employment opportunities (government 9  %; private sector 8  %). Date sales contributed > 50  % to the total income of 39  % of HH and 90 – 100  % to 24  % of HH. Overall farmers grew a total of 39 <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> cultivars and cultivated an average of 409  ±  559 mature <b>date</b> <b>palms.</b> The majority of the respondents sold dates to commission agents (35  %), contractors (22  %) and wholesalers (21  %), while 28  % of HH cultivated <b>date</b> <b>palms</b> only for self-consumption. <b>Date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>growers</b> had only limited knowledge about high quality date cultivars, optimized farm management and about effective post-harvest conservation. Changes in extension and marketing efforts are needed to allow farmers to better exploit value chains in date thereby reaping higher benefits from improved market access to secure their often marginal income.|$|R
40|$|<b>Date</b> <b>palm</b> (Phoenix dactylifera L.) {{occupies}} {{almost three}} {{percent of the total}} worldwide cultivated area, with an annual production of seven million tonnes (t). Pakistan is an ideal place for the cultivation of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> due to its sandy loam soil and semi-arid climate. In 2012, Pakistan produced 600, 000 t of dates, on an area of 95, 000 ha. Baluchistan province is the country’s top date producer, followed by Sindh, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) provinces. More than 300 date varieties are known to exist in Pakistan and some commercially important cultivars are: Karbalaen, Aseel, Muzawati, Fasli, Begum Jhangi, Hillawi, Dashtiari, Sabzo, Koharaba, Jaan Swore, Rabai and Dhakki. Six districts from the four provinces of Pakistan (Jhang, Muzaffargarh and Bahawalpur (Punjab), Dera Ismail Khan (KPK), Khairpur (Sindh) and Panjgur (Baluchistan)) with largest area under <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> cultivation were selected to conduct socio-economic surveys including the income sources of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>growers.</b> A structured questionnaire with open-ended and closed questions was used for face-to-face interviews of 170 <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>growers.</b> At each location after selection of a first farmer through a local guide, the former was requested to provide names and addresses of three other date growers in his area. From these three names, one was randomly selected for the next sampling. Additionally, <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> fronds and fruits of all available cultivars were collected for morphological and nutritional analyses. Soil samples were collected from the groves for subsequent chemical and physical analyses. Almost all farmers used dates as a food item for their families and some were using low quality dates as a feed for their livestock. Apart from <b>dates,</b> other <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> components (trunk, spadix, frond, inflorescence and seed) were used by <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>growers</b> as a raw material for making many by-products for their families. <b>Date</b> <b>palm</b> had a major contribution in the income of households, 24 % received 91 - 100 % of their income from <b>date</b> <b>palms.</b> More than half of the surveyed farmers had <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> groves, but scattered plantations, home gardens and intercropping systems with cereal and other fruits were also present. Dhakki, Muzawati, Aseel, and Karbalaen were the most important commercial cultivars grown in the provinces of KPK, Baluchistan, and Sindh. Aseel, Karoch, Haleni, Karbalaen, and Muzawati cultivars had the most firm fruit and good total soluble sugar, calcium and magnesium contents. The amount of magnesium found in dates of studied cultivars ranged from 0. 143 to 0. 876 mg g- 1. A great variation in frond morphology was recorded among the cultivars. Fruit length and fruit weight was highest in Dhakki date, making it visually more attractive for customers in addition to its good nutritional properties. The seed weight of the studied cultivars ranged from 0. 7 - 2. 0 g, while Desi dates had largest seed, making them less attractive for marketing. However, in terms of nutritional value and fruit size, most of the investigated varieties can compete with globally important commercial dates.

30|$|The {{socio-economic}} conditions and food security status in <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> growing areas in Pakistan are poorly documented (Suleri and Haq 2009). Some authors claim that rural income in rural Pakistan {{can be raised}} by the on-farm exploitation of more efficient post-harvest and marketing of dates (Goletti and Samman 1999). Date growers in Pakistan often depend on advanced payments and other informal credits from commission agents, wholesalers and contractors who skim off {{a substantial portion of}} the fruit´s final market value (Ata 2011). <b>Date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>growers</b> are often limited in self-marketing of their products given their poor education (Khushk et al. 2009). The prevalence of traditional marketing structures results in an estimated 30 – 40  % deterioration of fresh produce before it reaches the consumer (PHDEB 2008). Other limitations in <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> cultivation areas include low quality of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> cultivars, poor farm management, lack of processing facilities, uncertainty in prices at the time of selling and shortage of qualified trained labour (Mahmoudi et al. 2008).|$|R
30|$|The {{widespread}} use of diverse <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> products {{in the study area}} indicates the role of this crop for local farm HHs. The low literacy rate of farmers may hinder the adoption of farm innovations leading to more intensive production systems and post-harvest value addition for this crop. Improved market access, cooperative sale structures and/or quality-based labeling with direct sales to consumers may help to enhance the role of dates in HH income thereby strengthening local farmers’ income. This will require enhanced government investments in rural extension, consumer and producer awareness of produce quality including the establishment of grading standards for <b>dates</b> and <b>palm</b> nurseries with high quality germplasm. Generalizing the results of our study is hampered {{by the fact that the}} selection of our HHs based on the snowball sampling approach was not fully random given lacking governmental or private records of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>growers</b> in most remote study areas.|$|R
30|$|In {{our study}} area, {{processing}} and export {{were not part}} of a regular marketing chain. A similar situation was reported by Walsborn (2008) for date marketing in Iraq. In our study, 69  % of the <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>growers</b> sold their produce to contractors, wholesalers or commission agents, mainly due to the unavailability of proper credit facilities and labour, and the large distance to the nearest market. The low revenues for the producer is a general characteristic of the fruit marketing sector in Pakistan, where farmers’ share of the consumer price is about one-fourth while the remaining share goes to commission agents (7  %), contractors (39  %), wholesalers (9  %) and retailers (19  %; Mahmood et al. 1989; Khushk and Smith 1996).|$|R
30|$|The {{data were}} coded into {{numerical}} values, tabulated {{and subjected to}} descriptive analysis in Excel (Microsoft Office 2007). Initially the five most important variables (province-wise distribution of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> cultivars, number of mature <b>date</b> <b>palms,</b> planting types, yield, and selling of dates) that characterized <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>growers</b> were subjected to Spearman correlation analysis and key variables least correlated with each other were identified (Raza et al. 2014). Subsequently, a two-step cluster analysis was performed comprising both categorical and numeric data on socio-economic household characteristics (Abas et al. 2013; Abdulkadir et al. 2012; Dossa et al. 2011). Kruskal–Wallis tests and Chi 2 analyses were used to detect significant differences and to evaluate the effect of assessed variables (categorical and continuous) on the clusters (Vazhacharickal et al. 2013; Rehman et al. 2013). Because of the large differences in the financial status (land and labour assets, income and expenses) of HHs, they were divided into seven groups (Rehman et al. 2013). All {{statistical analyses were performed}} with SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The significance threshold was set at P ≤  0.05.|$|R
30|$|Average {{annual income}} of date {{producers}} in our study area was 6000 US$ which is {{much larger than the}} average {{annual income of}} 1475 US$ reported for <b>palm</b> <b>growers</b> in the Southern Punjab (Ata et al. 2014). For almost half of the farmers of the present study, date sales contributed 50  % to total HH income. Chowdhury et al. (2008) also reported a significant contribution of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> to the total income of farmers in date producing areas of rural Bangladesh. The low contribution of off-farm activities to <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>grower’s</b> HH income is similar to results of Ata (2011) for the Pakistani Southern Punjab where crop sale was the primary and livestock rearing the secondary income source. All respondents in our study area used dates as a food crop and most utilised other palm parts (especially fronds and trunks) to make mates, staple dishes, and huts for both household and commercial purposes. Hassan et al. (2006) reported the same usage of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> in the Punjab where dates and by-products were used and sold by the native community. Most of the respondents in the Jhang District (Punjab) also used dates as animal feed. Such type of usage is also reported by Walsborn (2008) in Iraq where low quality dates are sold as animal feed to sheep herders, dairies, and to the companies making date syrup. This practice should also be adopted in other <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> growing areas of Pakistan to increase HH income.|$|R
30|$|Contractors are {{important}} parts of the date marketing chain in Pakistan. They perform early yield estimates of palm groves and costs for labour, storage, transportation, and processing of dates (Khushk et al. 2009). Often contracts for <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> grove were made as early as at the pollination stage. This again was similar to data reported by RUAF (2014) for value chain of dates in Gaza. In our study contractors payed (5  %) more to <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>growers</b> for their produce compared with commission agents. Some contractors also took loans from commission agents; they either sold dates through them or payed back loans and interest after marketing their produce. Aujla et al. (2007) noted that 70 – 90  % of the fruit growers in Pakistan sold their harvesting rights at the flowering stage to contractors, while more than 97  % of the fruit contractors took loans from commission agents to pay the contract money to fruit orchard owners and labourers working in the groves. This underlines the dependency of contractors on commission agents for credit in the study area.|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to mechanize the <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> pollination given its importance. Indeed, this work contributes to the enrichment of this topic by providing a new pollination device to <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>growers.</b> This pollinator consists of a powdering device mounted on a telescopic pole. Field tests of this pollinator were conducted in Touggourt and Biskra (Algeria). The date yield obtained with this pollinator {{was the same as}} that of the traditional pollination method. The cost of the device was less than the cost of pollinating about 25 palm trees by the traditional method. Moreover, pollination by this device required half the time which was necessary by the traditional method of pollination. With this device, the safety of the farmer is assured since he doesn’t have to climb the palm tree anymore which is also very important. The promising research results obtained testing the developed pollination device makes this pollinator an alternative option for farmers in economic, security and time savings terms. And when the function of this pollinator is based on the dispersion of pollen, we determined that the best percentage pollen / wheat flour was 20...|$|R
40|$|The {{invasion}} of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (red palm weevil, RPW) and Paysandisia archon (palm borer moth, PBM) in the Mediterranean Basin {{is a major}} problem for <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> <b>growers</b> and landscape managers, agriculturists, and gardeners, who need to manage these pests. Accurate detection of early infestations is important for the survival of the infested palms but it is a very challenging task, as often there are no apparent symptoms at the initial stages of the infestation by these borers. Visual inspection is still the most common method of infestation analysis. Infestation by the PBM is usually recorded more peripherally in the stipe than that by the RPW, particularly {{at the end of the}} moth's development, at the prepupal stage. In this chapter, visual symptoms observed in the most economically important palms in the Mediterranean Basin (the <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> Phoenix dactylifera L. and the Canary palm Phoenix canariensis L.), and protocols for ascertaining the presence of these pests and the severity of the infestations are presented.

40|$|Oases are desert-farming agro-ecosystems, where <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> (Phoenix dactyliferaL.) plays a {{keystone}} role in offsetting {{the effects}} of drought and maintaining a suitable microclimate for agriculture. At present, abundance, diversity and plant growth promotion (PGP) of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> root-associated bacteria remain unknown.

Here, the ecology of <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> root endophytes from oases in the Tunisian Sahara was studied with emphasis on their capacity to promote growth under drought. Endophytic communities segregated along a north-south gradient in correlation with geo-climatic parameters. Screening of 120 endophytes indicated that <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> roots select for bacteria with multiple PGP traits.
