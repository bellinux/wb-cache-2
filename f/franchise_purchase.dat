[...] As with other periods of the Cardinals' transaction history, doubt loomed {{as to whether the}} purchaser would keep the team in St. Louis, due to the city's status as a [...] "small market", which appear to handicap a club's competitiveness. [...] Such was the case when Sam Breadon put the Cardinals up for sale in 1947: then-NL President Ford Frick proposed moving the Cardinals to Chicago. [...] When AB placed the Cardinals for sale in 1995, they publicly expressed intention to find a buyer who would keep the club in St. Louis. [...] In March 1996, AB sold the team for $147 million to a partnership headed by Southwest Bank's Drew Baur, Hanser and DeWitt, Jr. [...] Civic Center Redevelopment, a subsidiary of AB, held the parking garages and adjacent property and also transferred them to the Baur ownership group.

40|$|This paper {{aimed at}} {{establishing}} how {{the knowledge of}} <b>franchise</b> <b>purchase</b> as self-employment strategy among the lecturers of entrepreneurship, leisure and hospitality at Makerere University Business School (MUBS), Uganda is transferred to the students whom they teach, other universities that bench-mark with MUBS, {{and the general public}} in Uganda and the region during the global economic crisis which is causing many lay-offs.

40|$|Purpose - This study {{explores the}} {{hospitality}} <b>franchise</b> <b>purchase</b> decision-making process undertaken by franchisees in Macau as an emerging tourism destination, {{and the role}} of national culture on purchasing a franchise brand and selecting a potential franchisor. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured in-depth interviews with 18 franchisees in Macau, who purchased international and domestic hospitality franchise brands, were conducted to understand the feelings, attitudes and motivation of franchisees towards purchasing a hospitality franchise. Findings – The study reveals that national culture can {{play an important role in}} franchisees’ decision-making process. Personal networks of friends and family (guanxi) are very influential in introducing and steering aspiring entrepreneurs towards franchising as an option to realize their ambitions, although there may be some limitations to franchisees with this approach. Guanxi, was also found to be particularly relevant during negotiations and franchisees’ postpurchase reviews. Practical implications – International franchisors should understand the importance of guanxi at different stages of franchisees’ decision-making process. Franchisees should realize how a reliance on guanxi might negatively impact on their efforts to undertake sufficient research to thoroughly evaluate the franchisor offer prior to contract signature. Originality/value - A comprehensive hospitality franchisee decision-making purchase framework is developed which includes the cultural context and cultural values. Guanxi in particular, impacts upon the franchisee decision-making process...|$|E
