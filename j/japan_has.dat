Ninety four in total have been in captivity in Japan, eleven in China, {{and at least two}} in Indonesia. <b>Japan</b> <b>has</b> had three establishments designated for breeding them, and there have been five recorded births. Three calves died moments after their birth, but two survived for several years. This breeding success proved that porpoises can be successfully bred in captivity, and this could open up new conservation options.|$|E
5|$|<b>Japan</b> <b>has</b> 108 active volcanoes. During {{the twentieth}} century several new volcanoes emerged, {{including}} Shōwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and Myōjin-shō off the Bayonnaise Rocks in the Pacific. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, a 9.1-magnitude quake which hit Japan on March 11, 2011, and triggered a large tsunami. Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index.|$|E

5|$|<b>Japan</b> <b>has</b> a {{comprehensive}} network of legislation for protecting, preserving, and classifying its cultural patrimony. The regard for physical and intangible properties and their protection {{is typical of}} Japanese preservation and restoration practices. Methods of protecting designated National Treasures include restrictions on alterations, transfer, and export, as well as financial support {{in the form of}} grants and tax reduction. The Agency for Cultural Affairs provides owners with advice on restoration, administration, and public display of the properties. These efforts are supplemented by laws that protect the built environment of designated structures and the necessary techniques for restoration of works.|$|E
5|$|<b>Japan</b> <b>has</b> {{the second}} longest overall life {{expectancy}} at birth {{of any country}} in the world: 83.5 years for persons born in the period 2010–2015. The Japanese population is rapidly aging {{as a result of a}} post–World War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates. In 2012, about 24.1 percent of the population was over 65, and the proportion is projected to rise to almost 40 percent by 2050.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{architecture}} {{is a combination}} between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (fusuma) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, <b>Japan</b> <b>has</b> incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.|$|E
