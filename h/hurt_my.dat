25|$|I thought I {{would write}} Memories and the City in six months, {{but it took}} me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have <b>hurt</b> <b>my</b> mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E
500|$|Newell was {{the person}} to bring Washington out of the despair Kermit felt when he heard his playing career was {{probably}} over. Newell forced him through even more grueling training sessions the following summer, after some of which, Washington strongly considered quitting. His leg had atrophied from the injury and he was scared of re-injuring it during their training sessions. Newell ignored his pleas {{and told him that}} if he ever wanted to play again he had to train more than before and work even harder. Washington came back to play the following season and performed well; through the first 25 games he was averaging career highs in points (11.6) and rebounds (10.8). He had been featured in the NBA preview edition of Sports Illustrated (which was dedicated to enforcers that year) before the season and was praised therein for his intimidating nature and fighting skills. The magazine had posed Washington shirtless in a boxing stance as part of a picture layout entitled, [...] "Nobody, but Nobody, Is Gonna <b>Hurt</b> <b>My</b> Teammates." ...|$|E

[...] He returned to Stanford in September 1928 as coach of the reserve football players.|$|E

2500|$|Eleven {{hours into}} his interrogation, Shore {{confessed to the}} murders of Carmen Del Estrada, Diana Rebollar, and Dana Sanchez. He also confessed to the 1987 murder of fourteen-year-old Laurie Tremblay and the 1994 rape of a fourteen-year-old girl. Detectives {{had no way of}} linking this killing to the other three murders because Tremblay was strangled with a ligature. When asked why he {{switched}} to a tourniquet, Shore replied, [...] "because I <b>hurt</b> <b>my</b> finger while murdering Tremblay." ...|$|E

2500|$|Recruited {{from the}} Christian Young Men's Society in 1931, Curcio was a tough, hard ruckman, who also played {{well in the}} back line. He was [...] for {{protecting}} his smaller teammates. A bass violinist, Curcio combined his musical talents with his football prowess, but stood {{out of the game}} in 1937 to concentrate on his music. Ever conscious of safegarding his hands to work the strings of the bass violin, he once told North Melbourne's Fred Fairweather, Hit me as hard as you like, but don't <b>hurt</b> <b>my</b> fingers.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1931, the Depression was taking its toll on the Negro leagues, and the Black Barons had {{temporarily}} disbanded. Few teams could afford Paige, but Tom Wilson, who was moving the Nashville Elite Giants to Cleveland as the Cleveland Cubs, thought he could. Playing {{in the same city}} as a white major league team, Paige recalled, [...] "I'd look over at the Cleveland Indians' stadium, called League Park ... All season long it burned me, playing there in the shadow of that stadium. It didn't <b>hurt</b> <b>my</b> pitching, but it sure didn't do me any good." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chambers {{dreamed of}} having a career in {{mainstream}} films and believed her celebrity as the star of Behind the Green Door and the Ivory Snow girl would be a stepping stone to other endeavors. [...] "The paradox was that, {{as a result of}} Green Door, Hollywood blackballed me," [...] she said later. [...] " [...] became a very high-grossing film...But, to a lot of people, it was still a dirty movie; for me to do anything else, as an actress, was totally out of the question. I became known as a porno star, and that type of labeling really hurt me. It <b>hurt</b> <b>my</b> chances of doing anything else".|$|E
2500|$|The first unit {{then shot}} {{for three days}} in Egypt at the Giza pyramid complex and Luxor. The shoot was highly secretive, but {{according}} to producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura, a crew of 150 Americans and [...] "several dozen local Egyptians" [...] ensured a [...] "remarkably smooth" [...] shoot. Bay earned the Egyptian government's approval to film at the pyramids by contacting Zahi Hawass, whom Bay said [...] "put {{his arm around me}} and said, 'Don't <b>hurt</b> <b>my</b> pyramids. A [...] camera crane was used at the location. Bay stated he found the climax of the first film to be weak, partly because it was shot across five different city blocks, making the action confusing and hard to follow. On this film, the final battle in Egypt was devised {{to make it easier to}} follow the action.|$|E
2500|$|According to Gomez, one of {{the main}} inspirations behind the track was the body-shaming she dealt with from tabloids and social media, after photos {{surfaced}} online of the singer in a bikini during a trip to Mexico in April 2015. [...] Many claimed she gained weight, with some news outlets going as far as to label her a [...] "mess", and suggested Gomez was [...] "going off the deep end". She commented: [...] "I was getting a lot of hate for my body and ‘you’re gaining weight,’ and so I was in Mexico and I was just feeling all of this stuff and I would be lying to you if I said it didn’t kind of <b>hurt</b> <b>my</b> feelings, but I kind of channeled that into my music." [...] Gomez called the experience [...] "degrading", explaining that she had never been through intense bullying before.|$|E

2500|$|The Asquiths finally vacated 10 Downing Street on 9 December. Asquith, not {{normally}} given to displays of emotion, confided {{to his wife}} that {{he felt he had}} been stabbed. He likened himself (10 December) to the Biblical character Job, although he also commented that Aristide Briand's government was also under strain in France. Lord Newton wrote in his diary of meeting Asquith at dinner {{a few days after the}} fall; [...] "It became painfully evident that he was suffering from an incipient nervous breakdown and before leaving the poor man completely collapsed." [...] Asquith was particularly appalled at Balfour's behaviour, especially as he had argued against Lloyd George to retain Balfour at the Admiralty. Writing years later, Margot's spleen was still evident; [...] "between you and me, this is what <b>hurt</b> <b>my</b> husband more than anything else. That Lloyd George (a Welshman!) should betray him, he dimly did understand, but that Arthur should join his enemy and help to ruin him, he never understood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to submit {{two of his}} compositions to Spector: [...] "Don't Worry Baby" [...] and [...] "Don't <b>Hurt</b> <b>My</b> Little Sister"; both written with the Ronettes in mind.

Harry Nilsson wrote [...] "This Could Be the Night" [...] (1966) {{as a tribute to}} Wilson, with production helmed by Spector. Modern Folk Quartet's Henry Diltz recalled Wilson at the studio during the sessions: [...] "we could see him in the recording booth, in his robe and slippers, sitting there playing our song over and over, for what seemed like hours". Wilson deemed it one of Nilsson's very best compositions and one of Spector's best productions, explaining [...] "Well, the idea they've been dating and waiting and finally they made love… I love that message." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ahead of {{him were}} Nanette Mikac and her children, Madeline, 3, and Alannah, 6. Nanette was {{carrying}} Madeline, and Alannah was running slightly ahead. By this point, they had run approximately [...] {{from the car}} park. Bryant opened his door and slowed down. Mikac moved towards the car, apparently thinking he was offering them help in escaping. Several more people witnessed this from further down the road. Someone recognised him as the gunman and yelled out [...] "It's him!" [...] Bryant {{stepped out of the}} car, put his hand on Nanette Mikac's shoulder and told her to get on her knees. She did so, saying, [...] "Please don't <b>hurt</b> <b>my</b> babies". Bryant shot her in the temple, killing her. Next, he fired a shot at Madeline, which hit her in the shoulder, then shot her fatally through the chest. Bryant shot twice at Alannah, as she ran behind a tree, missing. He then walked up, pressed the barrel of the gun into her neck and fired, killing her instantly.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Paulini {{successfully}} {{auditioned for}} the first season of Australian Idol, and progressed through to the theatre rounds. Following the theatre round process, Paulini had advanced through to the semi-finals and eventually {{made it into the}} top twelve. Throughout the season, Paulini continued to impress the judges and viewers with her performances of songs by Aretha Franklin, Barbra Streisand, Thelma Houston, Toni Braxton, and Etta James. In the final five week, following her rendition of Destiny's Child's [...] "Survivor", male judges Mark Holden and Ian [...] "Dicko" [...] Dickson were not impressed with the tight-fitted gold dress Paulini wore for the performance. Dicko commented on the dress saying [...] "You should choose more appropriate clothes or shed some pounds", which resulted in a great deal of debate and controversy in the media relating to self-esteem and body image of teenage girls. After hearing Dicko's comments, Paulini went backstage and cried. In an interview with Woman's Day magazine, 11 years after the comment was made, Paulini stated [...] "It affected me a lot and it really <b>hurt</b> <b>my</b> confidence." [...] In the final four week, Paulini was eliminated from the competition. According to a poll taken on Australian Idol, Paulini's elimination was the second most surprising elimination in the show's history.|$|E
2500|$|The {{whistleblower}} at {{the centre}} of the allegations was later revealed to be Phaedra Almajid, who claimed that she had fabricated the claims of corruption in order to exact revenge on the Qatari bid after being relieved of her campaign job on the team. She signed a legal affidavit and claimed that she decided to go public with her admission because her [...] "lies had gone too far." [...] FIFA confirmed receipt of an email from Almajid stating her retraction. Having originally claimed African Football Confederation president Issa Hayatou, Ivorian FIFA member Jacques Anomua and Nigeria's suspended exco official Amos Adamu were paid $1.5m to vote for Qatar, Almajid went on to say [...] "I cannot tell you how sorry I am. I have hurt reputations of three members of the Fifa [...] exco, I have hurt their reputation, and more importantly I have <b>hurt</b> <b>my</b> colleagues on the Qatar bid." [...] She also stressed that she had not been put under any pressure by the Qatari bid team or anyone else to make a retraction. John Whittingdale, the chairman of the House of Commons select committee for culture, media and sport, stood by the decision to publish the allegations against Qatar and the three executive committee members despite the retraction.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, Jones met Nancy Sepulvado, a 34-year-old divorcée from Mansfield, Louisiana. [...] Sepulvado's {{positive}} impact on Jones' life and career cannot be overstated; she eventually cleaned up his finances, kept him away from his drug dealers (who reportedly kidnapped her daughter in retaliation), and managed his career. [...] Jones always gave her complete credit for saving his life. [...] Nancy, who did not drink, explained to Nick Tosches in 1994, [...] "He was drinking but he was fun to be around. [...] It wasn't {{love at first sight}} or anything like that. [...] But I saw what a good person he was, deep down, and I couldn't help caring about him." [...] Jones managed to quit cocaine but went on a drunken rampage in Alabama in fall 1983 and was once again straitjacketed and committed to Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital suffering from malnutrition and delusions. [...] But by that time, physically and emotionally exhausted, he really did want to quit drinking. [...] In March 1984 in Birmingham, Alabama - at the age of 52 - Jones performed his first sober show since the early seventies. [...] "All my life it seems like I've been running from something," [...] he told the United Press International in June. [...] "If I knew what it was, maybe I could run in the right direction. [...] But I always seem to end up going the other way." [...] Jones began making up many of the dates he had missed, playing them for free to pay back promoters, and began opening his concerts with [...] "No Show Jones", a song he had written with Glen Martin that poked fun at himself and other country singers. [...] Jones always stressed that he was not proud of the way he treated loved ones and friends over the years and was ashamed of disappointing his fans when he missed shows, telling Billboard in 2006 that [...] "I know it <b>hurt</b> <b>my</b> fans in a way and I've always been sad about that, it really bothered me for a long time." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{another point}} in the debate, when one {{moderator}} asked Clinton why polls showed she was less [...] "likeable" [...] than other candidates, particularly Obama, she jokingly replied, [...] "Well that <b>hurts</b> <b>my</b> feelings ... but I'll try to go on." ...|$|R
