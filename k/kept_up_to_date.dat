This project has been <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> to run on all variants of the S60 platform {{and there are several}} third party modules available. The Nokia N900 also supports Python with GTK widget libraries, with the feature that programs can be both written and run on the target device.|$|E
5|$|The LAMP {{architecture}} {{has become}} {{popular in the}} web industry {{as a way of}} deploying web applications. PHP is commonly used as the P in this bundle alongside Linux, Apache and MySQL, although the P may also refer to Python, Perl, or some mix of the three. Similar packages, WAMP and MAMP, are also available for Windows and macOS, with the first letter standing for the respective operating system. Although both PHP and Apache are provided as part of the macOS base install, users of these packages seek a simpler installation mechanism that can be more easily <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date.</b>|$|E

25|$|Edith Head {{designed}} the costumes. Wilder, Head and Swanson agreed that Norma Desmond would have <b>kept</b> somewhat <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> with fashion trends, so Head designed costumes closely resembling the Dior {{look of the}} mid-1940s. Embellishments were added to personalize them and reflect Norma Desmond's taste.|$|R
5|$|Although Bede's {{narrative}} is widely accepted, an alternative chronology {{has been proposed}} by D.P. Kirby. Kirby points out that Boniface's letter to Æthelburg {{makes it clear that}} the news of Eadbald's conversion is recent, and that it is unthinkable that Boniface would not have been <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> on the status of Eadbald's conversion. Hence Eadbald must have been converted by Justus, as is implied by Boniface's letter to Justus. The pallium accompanying that letter indicates Justus was archbishop by that time, and the duration of Mellitus's archiepiscopate means that even if Bede's dates are somewhat wrong in other particulars, Eadbald was converted no earlier than 621, and no later than April 624, since Mellitus consecrated a church for Eadbald before his death in that month. The account of Laurence's miraculous scourging by St Peter can be disregarded as a later hagiographical invention of the monastery of St Augustine.|$|E
5|$|Although Platt desired a recess, Hanna refused, {{wanting the}} {{convention}} to complete its work that day, and the delegates proceeded {{to the presidential}} nomination. McKinley had insisted that Foraker nominate him to demonstrate {{the unity of the}} Ohio Republican Party, and after some reluctance by the senator-elect, who feared blame if anything went wrong, Foraker agreed. McKinley was waiting with family and friends at his house in Canton, being <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> by telegraph and telephone. He was able to listen to part of Foraker's speech, and the tremendous reception that met it, over the phone line. McKinley was easily nominated on the first ballot, with Reed his nearest competitor. Canton erupted in celebration, with McKinley making speech after speech to the townsfolk and to those who poured in that day by rail from across Ohio, even from his birthplace of Niles.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{interested}} in the ministers of the Empire, Phipps was diverted to a deeper interest in Napoleon's marshals, primarily by the difficulty of obtaining facts about them. He capitalized on the growing interest of both Britons and the French in the Napoleonic period by purchasing, as they came out, the many personal memoirs published by {{the descendants of the}} participants. Indeed, by 1920, he had acquired over 2,000 volumes, plus sundry maps and letters. That year, in failing health, he moved to the house of his son, Charles, in Carlyle Square (21), Chelsea, London. There was no room for the books at his son's house, so Phipps gave them to All Souls College, Oxford; the majority of them were placed in the Codrington Library. He selected All Souls for its established reputation in military history, and for the Codrington's collection left to it by Sir Foster Cunliffe, who had been killed in action in 1916. The collection, called the Phipps Collection, numbered more than 2,000 volumes, and includes Napoleon's published correspondence, that of the marshals, and has been <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> with modern works issued by the Historical Department of the French General Staff.|$|E

The Queen asked the Prime Minister to send her good wishes to the people affected by and helping recover from the quake.|$|E

In the studio, he dubbed the Wurlitzer over acoustic piano parts to thicken the sound. From the mid-1970s, he also used Fender Rhodes pianos, and <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> with music technology. While touring, he alternated between grand piano, Rhodes and Wurlitzer on stage, for different songs.|$|E

25|$|A strong {{editorial}} activity {{took place}} during the Communist regime. With the purpose of educating the large masses of peoples, a huge number of books were published. Large-scale editing houses such as Cartea Românească, Editura Eminescu and others appeared, which published huge collections of books, such as the Biblioteca pentru Toţi ("The Library for Everyone") with over 5,000 titles. Generally, a book was never published in an edition of less than 50,000 copies. Libraries appeared in every village and almost all were <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> with the newest books published. Also, due to low prices, almost everyone could afford to have their own collection of books at home. The negative part was that all the books were heavily censored. Also, due to rationing in every aspect of life, the quality of the printing and the paper also was very low, and the books therefore degraded easily.|$|E
25|$|In February 2000, KPMG were {{appointed}} as provisional liquidators of Airdrieonians. This move came soon after Rangers chairman David Murray had {{applied for a}} court order to seize some of Airdrie's revenue in lieu of funds owed to another of his companies. KPMG and the board hoped more private investment would be made in the club. Most of the playing staff were made redundant {{at the end of the}} 1999–2000 season. Steve Archibald put forth a bid for the club and during the 2000–01 season he brought in many foreign players, including David Fernández, Jesus Sanjuán, Antonio Calderón and Javier Sánchez Broto, that became popular with the fans and won the Scottish Challenge Cup in 2000. KPMG terminated their management deal with Archibald in February 2001, stating that Archibald had not <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> with payment of fees. After difficulty fulfilling their fixtures, Airdrie narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division.|$|E

Due to its success, a second collection of designs was released the next year, including a bubble dress and lingerie. An older-looking Sindy doll was released in 1985, with male and female companions Mark and Marie. The advertising campaign was worth £1.5 million.|$|E

Gaimar implies that there was a copy at Winchester in his day (the middle of the 12th century); Whitelock suggests that there is evidence that a manuscript that has not survived to the present day was at Winchester in the mid-tenth century.

500|$|However, in a blunder, the {{planners}} had set flight paths that took many units {{over some of}} the most heavily defended areas on the continent, namely the V2 launch sites around The Hague. These sites were protected by large numbers of German anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) units. At the turn of 1944/45 Air Command West had 267 heavy and 277 medium or light AAA batteries, and in addition to this there were 100 Kriegsmarine AAA batteries along the Dutch coast. Most of these lay in the sector of the 16th AAA Division, with its control station at Doetinchem, [...] northeast of Arnhem. Some of the AAA units been warned about the air operation but were not <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> with developments about changing timetables and the flight plan of German formations.
