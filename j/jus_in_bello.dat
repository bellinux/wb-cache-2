Such laws are not discussed in detail; however, given that the goal of the French mission in Algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense, it can be deduced that Tocqueville would not concur with Just war theory's jus ad bellum criteria of just cause. Further, given that Tocqueville approved of the use of force to eliminate civilian housing in enemy territory, his approach does not accord with Just War Theory's <b>jus</b> <b>in</b> <b>bello</b> criteria of proportionality and discrimination.|$|E

2500|$|Analysts {{say that}} crimes {{committed}} {{during this time}} may not be covered under {{the laws of war}} (<b>jus</b> <b>in</b> <b>bello),</b> which shields soldiery of inferior rank from prosecution for acts committed under military or state orders. Paul H. Lewis, Professor of Political Science at Tulane University, who has written Guerrillas and Generals: The Dirty War in Argentina, is among those who claim otherwise. Terence Roehrig in his The Prosecution of Former Military Leaders in Newly Democratic Nations: The Cases of Argentina, Greece, and South Korea (McFarland & Company, 2001) estimates that of the disappeared, [...] "at least 10,000 were involved in various ways with the guerrillas". Justice Minister Ricardo Gil Lavedra, who formed part of the 1985 tribunal for the Trial of the Juntas, later went on record saying, [...] "I sincerely believe {{that the majority of the}} victims of the illegal repression were guerrilla militants." [...] The Montoneros in a statement issued in 1984 acknowledged having lost 5,000 guerrillas killed, and the Marxist–Leninist People's Revolutionary Army (Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo or ERP) in 2007 admitted the deaths of some 5,000 of their own armed fighters. Mario Firmenich, the commander of the Montoneros, in a radio interview in late 2001 from Spain said that, [...] "In a country that experienced a civil war, everybody has blood on their hands." ...|$|E
40|$|Since 2006, the new {{counterinsurgency}} (“COIN”) doctrine has {{revolutionized the}} way the U. S. military and its allies think about war. While COIN literature has proliferated in this period, relatively little legal scholarship has examined the relationship of COIN to international law. The legal scholarship that has engaged with COIN is overwhelmingly positive and assumes that the doctrine accords with the dictates {{of the law of}} war. In espousing human rights and civilian protection as its core principles, COIN provided a common discourse that appeared to bridge the conceptual divide between legal humanitarians and neo-pragmatists. However, the rhetorical success of COIN has come with significant, and as yet unrecognized, costs. This article argues that COIN’s influence on the law of war has had counterintuitive consequences that should give both COIN proponents and humanitarians pause. In particular, in a paradoxical move, COIN puts significant pressure on the core tenet of the law of war – the civilian-combatant distinction – in order to achieve its strategic objective of greater civilian protection. While legal scholars have celebrated COIN for its purported alignment with the law of war’s humanitarian goals, I show how COIN lends itself equally to the sort of <b>jus</b> ad bellum/jus <b>in</b> <b>bello</b> conflation that many scholars rebuke as violative of these same goals. COIN is aligned with law, I argue, only insofar as it seeks to exclude insurgents/terrorists from the law of war’s discursive terrain. In refusing to engage insurgents’ ad bellum objectives, COIN perpetuates international law’s liberal statist bias. Rather than progressively developing the law of war, as legal scholars argue it does, COIN is profoundly conservative. I suggest that a more responsible approach would admit insurgents as legitimate parties to war, in order that their political objectives could be substantively engaged with...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{international}} humanitarian law and, more in particular, with the interplay between law and morality in connection to the equal application principle. My assumption is that this principle {{is of paramount importance}} for the effectiveness of {{international humanitarian law}} and I will argue that this principle is jeopardized by the comeback of just war thinking. I will approach this issue mainly from an historical point of view. Accordingly, I will, firstly, analyse the history of the relation between ius ad bellum and ius <b>in</b> <b>bello</b> emphasizing the reasons that can explain why the decline of the just war theory (intended here as a set of ius ad bellum criteria) allowed the emergence of modern ius <b>in</b> <b>bello</b> (“modern” {{to the extent that it}} is characterised by the equal application principle). I will, secondly, analyse the gradual widening of the scope of the claims that call for an abandonment of the equal application principle; significantly enough those claims in the aftermath of the Second World War were concerning only some provisions of international humanitarian law, those that do not have a humanitarian character, while nowadays such claims are concerning some of the most important principles of international humanitarian law, as the prisoner of war status. My purpose is, therefore, to show that the just war theory was envisaging ius ad bellum prohibitions rooted in morality in the lack of positive law prohibitions; given that this theory was rooted in morality, it gave a decisive weight on the justness of the belligerent parties and, accordingly, the just party had no ius <b>in</b> <b>bello</b> obligation and the unjust party had no ius <b>in</b> <b>bello</b> rights. Nowadays, there are positive ius ad bellum prohibitions and positive ius <b>in</b> <b>bello</b> rules and the respective legal instruments refrain to resort to morality as a criterion of legality. A comeback of just war thinking would integrate in this positive law framework an alleged moral content and would jeopardize international humanitarian law itself, given that the equal application principle if of fundamental importance for the effectiveness of this branch of international law...|$|R
