40|$|Selenium is a biologically active microelement, {{contained}} {{in a number of}} hormones and enzymes. In a bird or animal organism selenium performs the following functions: strengthens the immune system, stimulates formation of antibodies, macrophages and interferons. Also, it is a powerful antioxidant agent. It stimulates processes of metabolism in the organism, protects the organism against toxic manifestations of cadmium, lead, thalium and silver; stimulates reproductive function, decreases acute development of inflammatory processes; stabilizes functioning of the nervous system; normalizes functioning of the endocrine system. Furthermore, it stimulates synthesis of hemoglobin, takes part in secretion of erythrocutes, neutralizes toxins, prevents and stops development of malignant tumors. It also has a positive effect on the cardiovascular system of an animal organism: prevents myocardosis and decreases the risk of development of cardiovascular diseases. Deficiency of selenium in the organism causes (depending upon the extent of deficiency) either physiological changes within the regulatory norm, significant disorders of the metabolism, or specific diseases. Around 75 different diseases and symptoms of pain are related to selenium deficiency. In most countries, the level of selenium consumption remains low (20 – 40 µg/day). There are several ways of improving of the selenium consumption of a population: consumption of selenium as a medication or dietary supplement, producing selenium-enriched bread, growing greens and vegetables rich in selenium, producing selenium-enriched beverages, products of animal origin, which would be rich in selenium. In the scientific-agricultural sphere studies have been made on the influence of adding different doses (0. 2 – 0. 6 mg/kg) of selenium in mixed feeds and peculiarities of its depositing and distribution in the muscle tissues of young growth of different species of poultry. It has been found that feeding broiler chickens, baby geese and ducklings with mixed feeds containing selenium in studied doses contributed to a reliable increase in concentration of this microelement in the chest muscles respectively by 21. 7 – 106. 7 %, 35. 1 – 40. 0 % and 23. 2 – 66. 0 % and the leg muscles – by 13. 0 – 85. 7 %, 57. 4 – 61. 7 % and 20. 5 – 79. 4 %. The meat of these types of birds is safe for human consumption from the perspective of food hygiene, for its selenium content is not higher than the TLV of this microelement for meat products (1. 0 mg/kg). Consuming selenium-enriched meat of chickens, baby geese and ducklings within recommended physiological norms (115 g of meat products/day) satisfies the daily need of an adult for this microelement (70 µg) y 12. 0 – 23. 5 %, 29. 1 – 30. 6 % and 11. 3 – 21. 5 % respectively. Taking this into account, selenium-enriched bird meat can be considered a <b>dietary</b> <b>foodstuff</b> suitable for biocorrectional function in humans. The viability of enriching bird meat products with selenium by adding selenium-containing premixes to fodder was proven experimentally. It was proven that adding optimum doses of selenium to mixed feeds for young birds bred for meat has a positive effect on the quality of meat, particularly on its biological value...|$|E

40|$|A {{food and}} drink intake survey was carried out among {{university}} students and staff members. Consumption data were collected on days when the participants took hot lunch in a university canteen. The dietary acrylamide exposure was calculated through a probabilistic approach and revealed a median intake of 0. 40 microg/kg bw/day [90 % confidence interval: 0. 36 - 0. 44], which is in accordance with previous exposure calculations. Biscuits (35. 4 %), French fries (29. 9 %), bread (23. 5 %), and chocolate (11. 2 %) were identified {{to be the main}} sources of <b>dietary</b> acrylamide. <b>Foodstuffs</b> consumed in between the three main meals of the day (so called snack type foods) contributed the most to the intake (42. 2 %).

The results of these studies become the basis for formation of sales estimates, and projected levels of revenues and profits from sales. Market researches are the essential condition to make offered goods successful at the market. It is market researches that help companies to realize the control of consumers' needs changing. The market researches on demand for dietary and prophylactic nutrition in the Saratov Region have been the research objective. In accordance with the given objective the following goals have been formed: 1) finding out the most spread diseases among the population; 2) determination of the average age of people suffering from one or another disease; 3) studying demand of products with food fiber additives; 4) analysis of respondent's preference regarding the addition of natural vegetable additives to foodstuff; 5) demand for <b>dietary</b> and prophylactic <b>foodstuff</b> among the population. Since the survey has been carried out among people suffering from various diseases, particular attention during the market research has been turned to the medical and prophylactic properties of food fibers to find out the attitude of the respondents to functional foodstuff.

40|$|Abstract Background Metal ions such as {{iron and}} copper {{are among the}} key {{nutrients}} that must be provided by <b>dietary</b> sources. Numerous <b>foodstuffs</b> have been evaluated for {{their contributions to the}} recommended daily allowance both to guide for satisfactory intake and also to prevent over exposure. In the case of heavy metal ions, the focus is often on exposure to potentially toxic levels of ions such as lead and mercury. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine target hazard quotients (THQ) from literature reports giving empirical levels of metal ions in table wines using the reference upper safe limit value. Contributions to the THQ value were calculated for seven metal ions along with total values for each wine. Results The THQ values were determined as ranges from previously reported ranges of metal ion concentrations and were frequently concerningly high. Apart from the wines selected from Italy, Brazil and Argentina, all other wines exhibited THQ values significantly greater than one indicating levels of risk. The levels of vanadium, copper and manganese had the highest impact on THQ measures. Typical potential maximum THQ values ranged from 50 to 200 with Hungarian and Slovakian wines reaching 300. THQ values for a sample of red and white wines were high for both having values ranging from 30 to 80 for females based on a 250 mL glass per day. Conclusion The THQ values calculated are concerning in that they are mainly above the safe level of THQ< 1. It is notable that in the absence of upper safe limits, THQ values cannot be calculated for most metal ions, suggesting that further unaccountable risks are associated with intake of these wines. </p...|$|R

The DFI for residents with a dietary of roasted corn and roasted chili was 5. 06, 9. 60, and 14. 38 mg for age groups 3 - 7, 8 - 15, and over 15 years, respectively. Over 90 % of DFI was from roasted foodstuffs. The DFI for residents {{of the same age}} group living on rice and roasted chili was 1. 94, 3. 50, and 4. 95 mg, respectively, which were less than that for the former dietary type, and 65 % of DFI was from roasted chili. The main sources for their DFI are roasted foodstuffs. Both were higher than the <b>dietaries</b> with non-roasted <b>foodstuffs</b> and the recommended daily allowances (RDAs) for USA and China at different levels. The DAsI for all residents ranged from 25 to 135 mu g, and at this level of DAsI, it would not influence human health. However, As pollution of roasted foodstuffs might have an important influence for the fluorosis. Residents are changing their staple food from roasted corn to rice, and especially, younger people are more focused on quality life. However, even if residents change their staple food, the habit of eating chili will not change, which also may cause them getting fluorosis. Developing economy, changing dietary types, and changing the habit of drying and keeping chili will help to reduce the fluorosis risk in coal-burning fluorosis area of Southwest China...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} twelfth-century Latin poem {{entitled}} Urbanus magnus or 'The Book of the Civilised Manâ, attributed to Daniel of Beccles. This is a poem {{dedicated to the}} cultivation of a civilised life, aimed primarily at clerics although its use extends to nobility, and specifically the noble householder. This thesis focuses on the text as a primary source for an understanding of social life in medieval England, and uses {{the content of the}} text to explore issues such as the medieval household, social hierarchy, the body, and food and diet. Urbanus magnus is commonly referred to as a 'courtesy text'. This thesis seeks to understand Urbanus magnus outside of that attribution, and to situate the text in the context of twelfth and thirteenth-century England. Thus far, scholarship of courtesy literature has focused on later texts such as thirteenth-century vernacular 'courtesy texts' or humanist works as exemplified by Erasmus's De civilitate morum puerilium. This scholarship looks back to the twelfth century and sees texts such as Urbanus magnus as 'early Latin courtesy texts'. This teleological view relegates such earlier texts to positions at the genesis of the genre and blindly assumes that they belong to the corpus of 'courtesy literature'. This neglects both their individual importance and their respective origins. This thesis examines Urbanus magnus as a didactic text which contains elements of 'courtesy literature', but also displays moral and ethical concerns. At the heart of the thesis is the question: should Urbanus magnus be considered as part of the genre of courtesy literature? This question does not have a simple answer, but this thesis shows that some elements and sections of Urbanus magnus do conform to the characteristics of courtesy literature. However, there are further sections that reflect other literary traditions. In addition to morals and ethics, Urbanus magus reflects other genres such as satire, and also reveals social issues in twelfth-century England such as the rise of anti-curiale sentiment and resentment of upward social mobility. This thesis provides an examination of Urbanus magnus through the most prevalent themes in the text. Firstly, it explores the dynamics of the medieval household, along with issues such as social mobility and hierarchy. Secondly, it focuses on the depiction of the body and bodily restraint, covering topics such as speech, bodily emissions, and sexual activity. Thirdly, it discusses food and diet, including table manners, food consumption, and <b>dietary</b> effects of <b>foodstuffs.</b> The penultimate chapter looks at the manuscript dissemination of the text to investigate the different uses which Urbanus magnus found in subsequent centuries. The delineation of Urbanus magnus as part of the genre of courtesy literature ignores the social, cultural, and literary impact on the creation of the text. In response, this thesis has two aims. The first is to minimise the notion of genre, and treat Urbanus magnus as a text in its own right, and as a product of the twelfth century. The second shows that Urbanus magnus reflects both continuity and change in society in England following the Norman Conquest. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of several types of dietary fibre on cholesterol metabolism and colonic function in young healthy subjects. Dietary fibre {{has been defined as}} those plant polysaccharides (cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectic substances) and lignin which are resistant to hydrolysis by the digestive enzymes of man. After a general introduction in Chapter 1, a review of reported experiments with healthy subjects is presented in Chapter 2. The few available data on dietary fibre consumption in Western communities are also summarized, and possible mechanisms for the action of dietary fibre on cholesterol metabolism and colonic function are discussed. Chapter 3 describes an experiment with 46 young healthy volunteers. The effects of a mixed high-fibre diet were studied, in which half of the dietary fibre was provided by vegetables and fruits, and the rest cam from cereal products. In Chapter 4 the results are presented from a trial with 62 subjects. In this study the effects of isolated citrus pectin were compared with those of the same amount of pectic substances contained naturally in fruits and vegetables, and also with those of a comparable amount of dietary fibre from wheat bran. Subjects in both studies were under strict <b>dietary</b> control. All <b>foodstuffs</b> except for 200 or 100 kcal (0. 8 or 0. 4 MJ respectively) per day were individually supplied, taking into account each subject's energy needs. Measurements were made of body weight, food consumption, serum total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol, faecal mass, the content of steroids, fat, and electrolytes in faeces, frequency of defaecation, intestinal transit-time, and blood pressure. From these two studies it is concluded that in short-term controlled experiments fibre-rich foodstuffs have only a small (vegetables and fruits) or no (bran) favourable effect on the concentration of serum cholesterol. However, in uncontrolled circumstances, a mixed high-fibre diet may through its low fat and cholesterol content indirectly reduce the level of serum cholesterol. After 5 weeks of high-fibre diets the amount and type of dietary fibre had no significant effect on the concentration of serum HDL-cholesterol. The effects on serum total cholesterol could be explained only to a small extent by changes in the excretion of faecal steroids. Although there was a wide interindividual variation in colonic response to increased dietary fibre intake (Chapter 3. 2.), in general a high-fibre diet with vegetables and fruits as well as a diet with bran shortened the intestinal transit-time and enhanced faeces production. Thus, it appears that the effects of certain types of dietary fibre on serum cholesterol are unrelated to their effects on colonic function. Finally, the above results are discussed in Chapter 5. It is concluded that a diet rich in cereals, as well as fruits, vegetables, and legumes may be advisable. However, at the present state of knowledge, it would be premature to make precise recommendations for dietary fibre intake...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the effect of type and amount of dietary fat on the {{concentration}} and composition of serum lipoproteins, colonic function, plasma glucose and serum insulin levels and blood pressure in healthy human volunteers. Two experiments were carried out. In the first experiment with 60 volunteers a moderate fat diet with {{a high proportion of}} polyunsaturated fatty acids (as recommended by several advisory bodies), was compared with three other diets during a test period of 5 weeks. One diet was low in total fat with a low proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, one diet was high in total fat with a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids and one was high in total fat with a low proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In the second experiment with 35 volunteers the moderate fat diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and the low fat, low polyunsaturated fatty acid diet were compared again, but this time the test period lasted 13 weeks. The diets were composed of regular foodstuffs and differed in carbohydrate and fat content or fatty acid composition only. There were only minor differences in intake of dietary fiber and other nutrients known to affect cholesterol metabolism. Subjects in both studies were under strict <b>dietary</b> control. All <b>foodstuffs,</b> except for 100 kcal (0, 4 MJ) per day were supplied individually according to each person's energy need. Actual food intake was measured by food records and analysis of double portions. The fatty acid composition of cholesterol esters in serum was analysed in the second experiment in order to check adherence to the diets. The serum lipoprotein composition and concentration observed during the experiments are given in Chapters 2 and 3. In serum, total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein-A I and -B were measured; in high-density-lipoprotein (HDL), cholesterol was measured; in low-density-lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol and triglycerides were measured and in very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides, apolipoprotein-B and the apolipoprotein-C II /C III ratio were measured. From these experiments two conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, that both a low fat diet, low in polyunsaturated fatty acids and a moderate fat diet, high in polyunsaturated fatty acids lower total serum cholesterol levels when compared with the habitual diet of affluent communities. Secondly, that a low fat diet causes lower HDL-cholesterol and higher fasting VLDL-triglyceride levels than a moderate-fat diet, high in polyunsaturated fat. It is by no means certain that changes in the concentration of HDL and VLDL really result in changes in the risk of death from cardiovascular diseases. In long-term intervention trials, such a hypothesis has not been tested; only the effect of changes in serum total cholesterol has been studied in intervention trials. Chapter 4 deals with effects on colonic function. No changes in mean transit time through the gut, fecal wet and dry weight, frequency of stools and concentration of fecal steroids were found. This shows that the intake of dietary fiber had been roughly equal in all diet groups within each experiment. Because there were no consistent short- or long-term changes in fecal bile acid or neutral steroid excretion, it is concluded that changes at the intestinal level do not explain the changes in total serum cholesterol concentration. Chapter 5 gives the results of measurements of fasting and postprandial serum insulin and glucose concentrations. The results show, that neither the amount nor the type of dietary fat had a strong influence on these variables in healthy subjects. Chapter 6 describes the effect of type and amount of dietary fat on blood pressure as well as the effect of dietary fiber from various sources and type of protein. None of these dietary components had a demonstrable effect on blood pressure in young normotensive subjects. The results of these experiments do not call for changes in the dietary recommendations of the Netherlands Nutrition Council, as far as the risk of death from cardiovascular diseases is concerned. ...|$|R
