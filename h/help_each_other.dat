5|$|My Transsexual Summer is a British documentary-style reality {{series about}} seven {{transgender}} people in {{different stages of}} transition. For five weekends {{in the summer of}} 2011, they stay together in a large holiday home in Bedfordshire, England, where they meet and <b>help</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> with some of the struggles that transgender people face. Between these weekend retreats, they go back to their lives and real-world challenges.|$|E
5|$|Niklausse and Van Tricasse {{climb up}} the clock tower to survey the troops. They are at first argumentative, then calm down and <b>help</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in the clean air at the top.

5|$|In {{the second}} season, the eight have grown {{accustomed}} to their connection and <b>help</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> on a daily basis. They learn more about Homo sensorium (the scientific name of sensates), the history and goals of BPO, the role of Angelica in it, their powers, and how to temporarily suspend them. They also meet other sensates, not {{all of whom are}} friendly. At the same time, Jonas attempts to both aid them and look after himself after being captured by Whispers, who is now involved in a cat-and-mouse game with Will, each of them trying to outsmart the other.|$|E

5|$|In each level, {{the player}} may come across one other player {{temporarily}} connected to their game. When players approach each other they charge one another's scarves. They cannot {{communicate with each}} other beyond patterns of singing. Players can <b>help</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by activating strips of cloth or showing paths, but cannot hinder each other and are not necessary for completing any level. When two players finish a section {{at the same time they}} remain together into the next one; otherwise they are connected to new players when they move on. While all of the figures generally look the same, without distinguishing characteristics, individual players can be told apart by unique symbols which are shown floating in the air when they sing and are displayed on their robes at all times. The entire game takes about two to three hours to complete.|$|E
5|$|Journey is Thatgamecompany's latest game. The player {{controls}} a robed {{figure who}} {{wakes up in}} a desert, with a large mountain in the distance as their destination. While traveling, the player can encounter other players over the Internet, one at a time. Players cannot communicate verbally, but may <b>help</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> or not as they wish. The game was released for the PlayStation 3 on March 13, 2012. Austin Wintory {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award in 2013 for Best Score Soundtrack for Journey, the first such nomination for a full video game score, but lost to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.|$|E
5|$|Prison Break {{revolves}} around two brothers: {{one who has}} been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit and his younger sibling, a genius who devises an elaborate plan to help him escape prison. The brothers, along with six other prisoners at Fox River State Penitentiary, manage to escape, and the second season follows a massive manhunt chasing the group. Dubbed the Fox River Eight, the group splits and members go their individual way, occasionally meeting up to <b>help</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> They struggle to escape from the police while avoiding a secret group of multinationals called The Company, that wants them all dead.|$|E

5|$|The {{negotiations}} between the city authorities and the peasants were not continued. While the authorities debated at the Tagsatzung {{how to deal with}} the insurrection, the peasants worked to gain support for their cause amongst the rural population of other regions and lobbied for a formal alliance. A peasant delegation sent to Zürich was turned back promptly: the city authorities, who had put down local unrests in their territory already in 1645 and again in 1646, had already recognized the danger of the agitation. On April 23, 1653, representatives of the people of the countryside of Lucerne, Bern, Basel, and Solothurn met at Sumiswald and concluded an alliance to <b>help</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> to achieve their goals. A week later, they met again at Huttwil, where they renewed that alliance and elected Niklaus Leuenberger from Rüderswil in the Emmental as their leader.|$|E
5|$|With over 3,000 members, Michigan State University's Greek Community {{is one of}} {{the largest}} in the US. Started in 1872 and re-established in 1922 by Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity, and Alpha Phi sorority; the MSU Greek system now {{consists}} of 55 Greek lettered student societies. These chapters are in turn under the jurisdiction of one of MSU's four Greek governing councils: National Panhellenic Conference, North American Interfraternity Council, National Pan-Hellenic Council, and Independent Greek Council. National Pan-Hellenic Council is made up of 9 organizations, 5 Fraternities and 4 Sororities, that were founded on Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU's). The Interfraternity Council and the Women's Panhellenic Council are each entirely responsible for their own budgets, giving them the freedom to hold large fundraising and recruitment events. MSU's fraternities and sororities hold many philanthropy events and community fundraisers. For example, in April 2011 the Greek Community held Greek Week to raise over $260,000 for the American Cancer Society, and $5,000 for each of these charities: Big Brothers Big Sisters, The Listening Ear and previous charities include: the Make-a-Wish Foundation (MSU Chapter), Share Laura's Hope, The Mary Beth Knox Scholarship, and the Special Olympics, in which fraternity and sorority members get to <b>help</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> participate.|$|E
5|$|Ellen rides back to {{town and}} accosts Cort. During sex, they promise to <b>help</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{overcome}} Herod. Ellen directly challenges Herod but is sickened to hear that he has already accepted a fight against The Kid. Ellen and Cort are the only other fighters left and are ordered by Herod to face off. They both proclaim they won't fight each other, but Herod tells them he will have them gunned down by his men if they refuse. Herod takes The Kid aside and asks him {{to withdraw from the}} contest, telling him his time will come. The Kid refuses and they fight, with The Kid wounding Herod in the neck while Herod delivers a fatal bullet to The Kid who dies in Ellen's arms. Ellen and Cort then face each other, but both refuse to draw their weapons. Herod begins a countdown from ten, declaring that if neither draws by the time he gets to zero he will have them both killed. Cort begs Ellen to kill him but she still refuses. When Herod reaches one Cort draws and fires. Doc Wallace declares Ellen dead, and Cort angrily storms up to Herod and demands they fight immediately. Herod refuses, telling Cort they will meet at dawn. Later that night, one of Herod's men, Ratsy, chains Cort to a table and beats him severely before smashing Cort's gunfighting hand and breaking it.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and the Fukushima I nuclear crisis, the Emperor made an historic televised appearance urging his people {{not to give up}} hope and to <b>help</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The Emperor and Empress also made a visit on Wednesday, 30 March 2011 to a temporary shelter housing refugees of the disaster, in order to inspire hope in the people. This kind of event is also extremely rare, though in line with the Emperor's attempts to bring the Imperial family closer to the people.|$|E
25|$|In Alliance, {{there are}} three teams, each limited to two players, both of which use the same persona. The point of this mode is to get more points than the other teams, but each team is chased by another and is only allowed to kill one {{specific}} team (not the team chasing them, {{but they will be}} able to stun the team hunting them). This mode encourages players to work together, as teammates can <b>help</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> or they can assassinate their targets simultaneously. The Advanced Alliance mode is a variant of Alliance mode, however the players' compasses as well as target engagement becomes more difficult, similar to the Advanced Wanted mode.|$|E

25|$|Hassan Pasha, {{instructed}} by the Sultan Suleiman, assembled soon {{an army of}} 100,000 men among Turks, Algerines {{and a large number}} of Janissaries. This army was supported by sea by a fleet of 30 galleys, 5 French carracks and 15 small vessels under the command of Jafar Catania, governor of Tlemcen. With these forces Hassan went to Mers El Kébir, stronghold whose dominion he considered essential to capture Oran. Meanwhile, Alonso and Martin de Córdoba had received supplies, gunpowder, tools and a few soldiers from Málaga. To hold together both towns in order to <b>help</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> they decided built two forts: San Miguel, located on the hill that separated Oran from Mers El Kébir, and Todos los Santos, facing the second town.|$|E
25|$|Two Athenians, Theseus and Pirithous, {{thought that}} {{since they were}} both sons of gods, both of them should have divine wives; they thus pledged to <b>help</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> abduct two daughters of Zeus. Theseus chose Helen, and Pirithous vowed to marry Persephone, the wife of Hades. Theseus took Helen and left her with his mother Aethra or his {{associate}} Aphidnus at Aphidnae or Athens. Theseus and Pirithous then traveled to the underworld, the domain of Hades, to kidnap Persephone. Hades pretended to offer them hospitality and set a feast, but, {{as soon as the}} pair sat down, snakes coiled around their feet and held them there. Helen's abduction caused an invasion of Athens by Castor and Pollux, who captured Aethra in revenge, and returned their sister to Sparta.|$|E
