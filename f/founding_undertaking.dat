40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of EU-based transnational marketing joint ventures (MJVs) {{through a set of}} case studies. The results emphasise the instability inherent in MJVs, and in most cases instability reflected poor performance rather than the evolution of a successful venture in the foreign market. Companies were <b>found</b> to <b>undertake</b> MJVs in order to protect and control existing market positions in the foreign country rather than gain access. Little attempt was made to transfer knowledge and expertise between the partners. Under these conditions instability resulted in the failure of the parent company to achieve its primary objective: the protection of marketing assets in the foreign market. Exporters should consider mechanisms through which local expertise can be transferred within the MJV. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a project to embed {{information}} literacy skills development in a first-year undergraduate business course at an Australian university. In accordance with prior research suggesting that first-year students are over-confident about their skills, the project used an optional online quiz to allow students to pre-test their information literacy skills. The students' lower than expected results subsequently encouraged greater skill development. However, not all students elected to undertake the first quiz. A final assessable information literacy quiz increased the levels of student engagement, suggesting that skill development activities {{need to be made}} assessable. We <b>found</b> that <b>undertaking</b> the information literacy quizzes resulted in a statistically significant improvement in students' information literacy skills from the pre-test to the post-test. This research therefore extends previous research by providing an effective means of delivering information literacy skill development to large cohorts of first-year students...|$|R

As this procession was moving along, however, a fire broke out in the town, and the attendants, actuated either by a sense of duty requiring them to aid in extinguishing the flames, or by curiosity to witness the conflagration, abandoned the funeral cortège. The procession was broken up, and the whole multitude, clergy and laity, went off to the fire, leaving the coffin, with its bearers, alone. The bearers, however, went on, and conveyed their charge to the church within the abbey walls.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if follicular aspirates obtained during oocyte retrieval for IVF were a good source of ovarian follicles for research purposes. METHODS: Follicular aspirates from 86 patients were collected and examined for the presence of follicles, and histological examination of tissue sample <b>found</b> was <b>undertaken.</b> RESULTS: Follicles were only obtained from aspirates of seven out of a total of 86 patients. From these samples a total of 14 follicles was found. The follicles were primordial, primary or secondary, 40 – 80 µm in diameter. Three of these recovered follicles were cultured and all degenerated within 2 days. In all aspirates some groups of granulosa cells that did not contain follicles or oocytes were found, as was vaginal epithelium that was also identified and verified by histology. CONCLUSIONS: Follicular aspirates are not a useful source of human follicles. Some structures found in the aspirates may be erroneously identified as follicles.

40|$|Geoarchaeological {{investigations}} of limestone caves along the Rove Peninsula, where several Lapita-era (1150 - 750 BC) sites {{dating from the}} earliest period of Fiji’s human history have been <b>found,</b> was <b>undertaken</b> by a team from the University of the South Pacific and the Fiji Museum. Surface collection and excavation in the largest cave – Qaranibourewa – was hindered by large amounts of ceiling collapse and no trace of human occupation earlier than about AD 1000 was found. The second-largest cave – Qaramatatolu – had a cave fill 190 cm thick but this {{was determined to be}} all of recent origin, having accumulated as a result of being washed down {{through a hole in the}} cave roof from a settlement above that probably existed AD 750 - 1250. The shell faunal remains from the Qaramatatolu excavation all suggest an open-coast location, quite different from the mangrove forest that fronts the area today.

It was <b>found</b> activities <b>undertaken</b> after the course were more a reflection on how little effort was required to carry them out than on the effectiveness of the course. Attitude measures tended to make it appear the course had an effect. The type of control group used for comparison purposes had a marked effect on whether the course appeared to have been effective. The need to consider these factors as influential variables when interpreting data from course evaluations was stressed...|$|R
