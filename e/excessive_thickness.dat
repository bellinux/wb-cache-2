40|$|Process {{technology}} for electronic packaging and MEMS is being confronted with higher topography on the wafer due to higher {{complexity of the}} devices. Especially spin coating of photoresists has severe limitations when dealing with larger three-dimensional features leading to <b>excessive</b> <b>thickness</b> in the bottom and inadequate thickness {{at the top of}} these features. One method to overcome the limitations of using spin-coated liquid photoresists on wafer surfaces with extreme topography is the electrophoretic deposition of photoresists. The electrophoretic resist coating process is based on the electrodeposition of either a negative tone or a positive tone photoresist from an aqueous solution onto a conductive seed layer. In the aqueous resist emulsion the ionized polymer forms charged micelles comprising solvent, dye, and photoinitiator molecules. When an electric field is applied micelles migrate by electrophoresis towards the corresponding electrode and form on the surface a self-limiting, insulating film. This electrode is the wafer that is supposed to be coated. The electrophoretic deposition is finished very quickly, usually after 10 sec. The coating experiments were mainly performed in a new ED resist coater, developed by MECO Equipment Engineers B. V. This coater is based on semiautomatic single wafer operation. The resulting layer thickness is mainly affected by the applied voltage and the temperature during the deposition. Final resist layer thicknesses between 3 - 20 µm are obtained in dependence of the applied voltage, the bath temperature, and the used resist type. Cavities, 300 - 400 µm deep, obtained on Si wafers either by wet chemical etching or by dry plasma etching were conformally coated with electrophoretic resists from Rohm and Haas Electronic Materials (RHEM).

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of postoperative or post-radiotherapeutic losses of substance {{in the oral}} cavity must respond {{to a number of}} basic requirements, such as lingual motility, the conservation of the labiogingival groove and adequate drainage of saliva towards the pharynx. This study reports the authors' experience of the {{reconstruction of}} the oral cavity using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap. The identification of anatomic structures, such as the interpectoral compartment which separates the deep folium of the pectoralis major muscle from the clavi-coraco-axillary fascia covering the smaller pectoral muscle. Is indispensable for the correct preparation of the flap. Using an oblique incision along the lateral margin of the pectoralis major muscle the edge of the muscle is revealed and the muscle is separated from the pectoralis minor and from the costosternal structure. The cutaneous island is formed using the deep level of the muscle, and after tunnelling into the subcutaneous plane of the superficial fascia in the deltopectoral region, the flap is overturned to reach the part of the surgical reconstruction. The transposed tissue is sutured at various levels so as to reduce traction on a single component of the flap and to preserve the integrity of the perforating vessels. A total of 16 reconstructions of the oral cavity were performed by the authors using a pedunculated flap from the pectoralis major muscle. Fourteen of these cases were advanced stages of cancer and two were the outcome of radiotherapy. A myofascial flap was used in one case due to the <b>excessive</b> <b>thickness</b> of the subcutaneous panniculus of fat, whereas in the other cases it was not necessary to involve the cutaneous component which guarantees better functional adaptation. The following results were obtained: the metaplasia of the cutaneous surfaces of the flap into a multi-stratified non-keratinized epithelium and the contemporary reduction of cutaneous adnexa. The best functional recovery was observed using myocutaneous flaps compared to the case with the myofascial flap. Other results included: flap versatility in the reconstruction of the region of the retromolar trigonum and antero-lateral oral floor, and lastly the difficulty of performing a correct plastic surgery of the soft palate in those cases with damage in the tonsillar region and consequent rhinolalia.

40|$|Existing {{thick film}} hybrid {{microcircuit}} (HMC) production utilizing integral thick film resistors requires that thick film resistors be deposited via screen printing {{directly on the}} base alumina substrate material. This requirement, when coupled with circuits of moderate to high density and associated layer buildup prior to resistor application, results in printing on surfaces with significant topography surrounding the resistor, compared to required as-printed resistor thicknesses. Due to the technological requirement to print resistors after most other thick film processing has been completed, resistor printing is seldom performed on a flat surface. The surface topography of the substrate surrounding the resistor area prohibits the printing process from maintaining a relatively uniform printed resistor thickness across the substrate. Although resistors are, in most cases, adjusted to final electrical values by physically modifying the length-to-width ratio through laser trimming, the resistors must be within certain resistance ranges. This variation in thickness translates into potential scrap product through extreme variation in as-fired resistor electrical values and/or product incapable of being laser trimmed due to <b>excessive</b> resistor <b>thickness.</b> The development of a thick film resistor application process compatible with existing conductor and dielectric materials and enabling more planarization of the print surface was needed to enhance production yields on products of moderate complexity...|$|R

The region was initially inhabited in the 13 th century and has many historic structures. The main structural materials are unreinforced masonry (URM) composed of rubble stone, brick, and hollow clay tile. Masonry units suffered the worst damage. Wood flooring systems and corrugated steel roofs are common in URM buildings. Moreover, unconfined gable walls, <b>excessive</b> wall <b>thicknesses</b> without connection with each other are among the most common deficiencies of poorly constructed masonry structures.

40|$|Purpose: In {{the past}} few years there has been growing {{interest}} in memristive devices. These devices rely on thin metal oxide films with a peculiar structure and composition, making precise control of oxide features vital. To this end, anodic oxidation allows a very large range of oxides to be formed on the surface of valve metals, whose thickness, structure and functional properties depend on the process parameters introduced. This work reports how memristive anodic oxides were obtained on titanium and other valve metals, such as niobium and tantalum. Methods: Anodic oxidation was performed on valve metals by immersion in H 2 SO 4 or H 3 PO 4 electrolytes and application of voltages ranging from 10 to 90 V. The memristive behavior was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry. Results: The behavior of differently grown oxides was compared to identify the best conditions to achieve good memristive performances. High voltages were identified as not suitable due to the <b>excessive</b> oxide <b>thickness,</b> while below 20 V the film was not thick and uniform enough to give a good response.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} methods for the corrosion protection of ferrous materials is hot-dip galvanizing. In this case the ferrous substrate is protected through its immersion in a bath of liquid zinc which involves the formation of a zinc layer on its surface with an average thickness of a few tens of μm. This layer is not homogeneous but it is composed by four phases which refer to Γ, δ, ζ and η phase of the Fe-Zn system. Although this method is about 200 years old, there is still a tremendous interest in it, because several problems are not yet solved. One of them is the clarification of its mechanism. For this purpose in the present work the morphology of the zinc coating was studied at varied temperatures and different ferrous substrates. This study took place with light and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore galvanizing kinetics were determined, along with the diffusion coefficients of zinc in steel and the Gibbs free energy changes. From the above investigation it was deduced that for the low silicon steels up to 480 oC the formation of galvanized coatings takes place in four successive steps. Initially, when the ferrous material comes in contact with the molten zinc, the liquid metal is solidified on the steel forming a very thick layer. This layer however is rapidly re-dissolved. This way the steel surface is remains exposed and as a result the first crystals of the ζ phase are nucleated on it. These crystals form a continuous layer. Γ and δ phases are formed with diffusion through this layer, while ζ continues to grow dentrically at the solid / liquid interface. H phase is mechanically drifted during the withdrawing of the ferrous substrate from the liquid metal. By contrast for high silicon steels (killed-steels), while the first two steps are the same, afterwards the ζ phase growth is very intense. As a result its crystals do not have time to grow in length and this phase is composed by small-sized grains. The growth of the Fe-Zn phase continues even after the withdrawn of the substrate from the liquid metal. Of course this mechanism is different when galvanizing takes place at 550 oC. In this case the δ phase is initially nucleated on the steel surface and its crystals are dentrically grown, while during withdrawing from the liquid zinc the crystallites of the ζ phase are trapped in the liquid phase which is drifted from the substrate. This way a large number of inclusions is formed. Nevertheless, apart from the above problem, for the galvanizing industry the improvement of the coating quality is also of great importance. The target in this field is the achievement of increased hardness and of sufficient but not <b>excessive</b> <b>thickness,</b> along with the increased corrosion resistance. These results could be accomplished with the dilution of different alloying elements in the liquid zinc or in the flux solution which precedes the immersion in the molten zinc. 4 In the present work it was examined the effect of seven different alloying elements in the liquid zinc. More specifically nickel, bismuth, titanium, manganese, silicon and selenium were taken into account. These elements were dissolved in liquid zinc. In the as-formed melts steel substrates were galvanized and their coating was characterized with light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-Ray diffraction. Afterwards the same samples were placed in a salt spray chamber where their corrosion was accelerated. From this research it turned up that, as far as it concerns the quality of the coating, the best result is achieved by the nickel addition, while manganese offers the best corrosion resistance. Consequently in industrial scale their simultaneous addition offers the best result. By contrast the dilution of different salts in the flux did not offer any improvement at all. In this case the effect of NaCl, KCl, SrCl 2, CdCl 2, NiCl 2, NiSO 4, SnCl 2, CuCl 2 και CuSO 4 was examined. The methodology of the study of their effect was the same with the previously used for the zinc melts. However NaCl, KCl and SrCl 2 worsen the quality of the coating, while the rest of them had no effect at all. Hence their application is rather useless. ...|$|E

To overcome materialistic limitation, accident tolerant fuel (ATF) was suggested to improve safety response of nuclear power plants during accidents by modifying cladding surface with various coating materials. When chrome was coated on cladding surface, it showed fewer weight gain by high temperature oxidation compared to bare zirconium cladding. Chrome forms chrome oxide or chromia (Cr 2 O 3) when oxidized, and this layer prevents further oxidation thus protecting inner material from oxidizing. However, previous studies indicated that implementation of chrome containing alloys have major drawbacks such as <b>excessive</b> coating <b>thickness</b> or degraded critical heat flux (CHF). Instead, direct coating of chromia was suggested in this study with the expectation of CHF enhancement compared to other chrome alloy coatings. Chromia nanoparticles were coated on nichrome wire surface with boiling deposition of chromia nanofluid. Another method was applying RF sputtering with chromia target. Chrome coating with DC sputtering were also tested for comparison. Verification of chromia coating was conducted by three steps: CHF measurement with wire pool boiling, high temperature oxidation in furnace to compare the oxidation resistance of specimens, and surface investigation. Surface characteristics investigation were conducted with measurement of contact angle by sessile drop method, capillary wicking height, and scanning electron microscope image. Experimental results show that chromia coating significantly increased CHF. Weight gain by oxidation indicate chromia nanofluid coating had improved oxidation resistance property...|$|R

A new two-step anodization process is also introduced to grow high quality alumina on Al boards and coat thick Cu layer over the alumina {{to produce a}} Cu/alumina/Al insulated metal substrate (IMS) structure. The measured resistance and breakdown voltage of the as-formed 50 µm anodic alumina layer is larger than 40 M&# 937; and 600 VDC, respectively. To test {{the reliability of the}} boards, they were put through 500 cycles of thermal cycling test and high temperature storage test. To ensure its compatibility with soldering operations, Cu substrates were bonded to the Al boards using a fluxless tin process. 	The fluxless bonding process is also applied to bond Si chips to low carbon steel substrates electroplated with Ni with desired thickness. Ni 3 Sn 4 is the only IMC formed at the Sn/Ni interface. In order to compare the result to the case without using underbump metallurgy. Sn was electroplated over low carbon steel directly and then Si was bonded to the low carbon steel substrate. Sn solder layer was bonded to Fe substrate by forming FeSn 2 at the Sn/Fe boundary.

The present research work focuses on bismuth vanadate thin films' deposition on FTO glass electrodes, through the dip coating technique, and discusses the influence of the film preparation technique on the electrode's photo-electrochemical performance. The bismuth vanadate thin films were synthesized with thicknesses ranging from 60 to 210 nm, depending on a number of dip coatings from 2 to 15. The structural and optical characterization of the films showed that monoclinic scheelite-type phase was obtained in all samples, with crystal sizes ranging from 24 to 65 nm, at increasing film thicknesses, and corresponding band gaps between 2. 55 and 2. 35 eV. A maximum photo-current density of about 0. 57 mA cm− 2 at 1. 23 V vs. RHE under sunlight illumination was obtained for an electrode thickness of 160 nm. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy elucidated the transport mechanisms occurring at the electrolyte-electrode interface, as well as inside the film. The estimation of the equivalent circuit parameters showed that an increasing film thickness decreased the resistance associated to the charge transfer between the electrolyte and the electrode (from 1100 to 450 Ω, from 60 to 160 nm layer thickness, respectively), given the higher number of active sites involved in the reaction. However, <b>excessive</b> film <b>thicknesses</b> increase the probability of charge recombination within the film and, in the specific case here investigated, can also be associated to film imperfections arising from several deposition-calcination cycles, which further act as traps.

The enhanced acoustic absorption is identified to be structure dependent regardless of the density. The sound dissipation in the open-celled structure {{is due to the}} viscous and thermal losses, whereas it is predominantly tortuosity in wave propagation and enhanced surface area for the GO-based lamella. In addition to the enhanced acoustic absorption and mechanical robustness, the lamella provides superior structural functionality over many conventional sound absorbers including, moisture/mist insulation and fire retardancy. The fabrication of this new sound absorber is inexpensive, scalable and can be adapted for extensive applications in commercial, residential, and industrial building structures.

40|$|Propósito: Estudiar y comparar las medidas de la presión intraocular (PIO) tomadas mediante un tonómetro de no contacto de aire (CANON TX- 10), con las obtenidas con el tonómetro de Goldmann. Métodos: Se ha explorado la PIO en 649 sujetos, con neumotonómetro y tonómetro de Goldmann. Se analizan la existencia de diferencias significativas y la influencia que las {{variables}} de edad, espesor y curvatura corneal tienen sobre la PIO. Resultados. La edad media de la población estudiada fue de 48, 5 años, con desviación estándar (DE) de 7, 6 años (rango entre 22 - 68). La media de la PIO fue de 15, 4 DE 2, 7 mmHg (8 - 25) para el tonómetro de Goldmann y de 15, 6 DE 2, 9 mmHg (8 - 29) para el neumotonómetro. Se encontraron diferencias significativas entre las medidas tomadas con el neumotonómetro de aire y el de Goldmann. p Purpose: To {{study and}} contrast {{the measurement of}} intraocular pressure (IOP) with an air non-contact tonometer (Canon TX- 10) with that obtained with the Goldmann tonometer. Methods: Intraocular pressure was measured in 649 subjects with both the pneumotonometer and the Goldmann tonometer. Statistically {{significant differences between the}} results obtained by both tonometers and the influence of variables including age, corneal thickness, and corneal curvature were studied. Results: The mean age of the study population was 48. 5 years, standard deviation (SD) 7. 6 years, with a range of 22 - 68 years. The mean IOP was 15. 4, SD 2. 7 mm Hg, (range 8 - 25) with the Goldmann tonometer and 15. 6, SD 2. 9 mm Hg (range 8 - 29) with the pneumotonometer. There was a statistically significant difference between the measurements using the air pneumotonometer and the Goldmann tonometer (p< 0. 001). The mean of the differences between both tonometers was 0. 24, SD 2 mm Hg. Seventy-five percent of measurements were in the range of ± 1, 85 % in ± 2, and 95 % in the Bland and Altman’s interval of 4. 42, - 3. 94. These differences were more significant for higher values of IOP, in thicker corneas and in corneas with greater curvature. A correlation between IOP and age was not found (p= 0. 247). Conclusions: The pneumotonometer is a useful and reliable instrument for measuring the IOP providing there is additional checking in cases with borderline values of IOP, or <b>excessive</b> corneal <b>thickness</b> and/or curvature...|$|R
40|$|The {{entry of}} satellite-derived decadal cloud {{datasets}} with homogeneous coverage {{in time and}} space enables studies not possible before. This thesis presents two such applications. The first study deals with cloud-aerosol processes and the second with an evaluation of cloud simulations from a regional climate model. The first part of the thesis describes the used satellite-derived dataset based on imagery from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on the polar orbiting NOAA satellites. A method for cloud retrieval and the compilation of a 1991 - 2000 Scandinavian cloud climatology are described. The second part reveals an intriguing anti-correlation between monthly mean satellite-derived cloudiness and the concentration of the cosmogenetic isotope Beryllium- 7 in near-surface aerosol samples for three measurement sites in Sweden. Large-scale transport processes are suggested as the most likely physical mechanism for this behaviour but more complex relations to cloud microphysical processes are not ruled out. The final part presents a thorough evaluation of cloud simulations of the SMHI Rossby Centre regional atmospheric model (RCA 3). Several model-to-satellite adaptations are applied to avoid artificial biases of results. The study stresses the necessity to account for initial differences between observed and modelled clouds caused by satellite cloud detection limitations. Results show good agreement of modelled and observed cloud amounts while the vertical distribution of clouds appears largely different. RCA 3 underestimates medium-level clouds while overestimating low- and high-level clouds. Also, the current use of the Maximum cloud overlap approach in the radiation scheme and an indicated excess of cloud condensate in modelled clouds appear to create <b>excessive</b> cloud optical <b>thicknesses</b> with serious implications for the surface radiation budget. Future applications are outlined based on greatly enhanced satellite-derived cloud and radiation budget datasets...|$|R
40|$|As a {{non-flammable}} and non-toxic natural fluid, CO 2 has a zero ODP (ozone depleting potential) and a zero effective GWP (global warming potential). Thus, it {{will become}} a primary candidate for the next-generation environmentally benign refrigerant in automobile air-conditioning, railway air-conditioning, residential air-conditioning and heat pumps. Cycles using carbon dioxide as the refrigerant usually have to operate in a transcritical cycle. As such, the heat rejection takes place at supercritical pressures in a so-called gas cooler. Use of mini/micro channels in the gas cooler not only allows one to handle high pressures effectively without <b>excessive</b> wall <b>thickness</b> and material weight, but also makes the refrigeration systems extremely compact. The objective of this thesis was to study the convective heat transfer characteristics of supercritical CO 2 in mini/micro tubes. There are two major challenges in this work: (i) thermophysical properties of the fluid exhibit rapid variations for the problems under investigation; and (ii) the flow passages are extremely small. The thesis began with the development of a cycle simulation model that predicts and optimizes the COP (coefficient of performance) of transcritical CO 2 cycles. Based on the cycle simulation, correlations of the optimal heat rejection pressure in terms of appropriate parameters were obtained for specific conditions. The cycle simulation also showed that the COP of the transcritical CO 2 cycle increases significantly with the decrease of the outlet temperature of the gas cooler. Therefore, to design a gas cooler with high heat transfer efficiency is crucial to transcritical systems. Laminar convective heat transfer of supercritical CO 2 flowing in vertical min/micro tubes was then investigated numerically in this thesis. Typical velocity profiles, temperature profiles, Nusselt numbers, and skin-fiction coefficients for circular tubes having diameters of 0. 5, 0. 7, 1. 4 and 2. 16 mm under both cooling and heating conditions with and without gravity were obtained. Finally, turbulent convective heat transfer and pressure drops of supercritical CO 2 flowing in horizontal and vertical mini/micro circular tubes under cooling and heating conditions were investigated experimentally. Six stainless steel circular tubes having inside-diameters of 0. 50 mm, 0. 70 mm, 1. 10 mm, 1. 40 mm, 1. 55 mm, and 2. 16 mm were tested. Measurements were carried out for pressures ranging from 74 to 120 bar, temperatures ranging from 20 to 120 °C, and mass flow rates ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 2 kg/min. It is found that the buoyancy effect was still significant, although supercritical CO 2 was in forced motion at Reynolds numbers up to 105. The experimental results also indicate that the Nusselt number decreased with the reduction in tube diameter. Based on the experimental data, correlations were developed for the Nusselt number and pressure drop in terms of appropriate dimensionless parameters for forced convection of supercritical CO 2 in mini/micro tubes. The results are of significance for the design of mini/micro channel gas coolers in the transcritical CO 2 cycles.

40|$|This study aims {{to improve}} {{understanding}} of carbon cycling in the Buor-Khaya Bay (BKB) and adjacent {{part of the}} Laptev Sea by studying the inter-annual, seasonal, and meso-scale variability of carbon and related hydrological and biogeochemical parameters in the water, as well as factors controlling carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission. Here we present data sets obtained on summer cruises and winter expeditions during 12 yr of investigation. Based on data analysis, we suggest that in the heterotrophic BKB area, input of terrestrially borne organic carbon (OC) varies seasonally and inter-annually and is largely determined by rates of coastal erosion and river discharge. Two different BKB sedimentation regimes were revealed: Type 1 (erosion accumulation) and Type 2 (accumulation). A Type 1 sedimentation regime occurs more often and {{is believed to be}} the quantitatively most important mechanism for suspended particular matter (SPM) and particulate organic carbon (POC) delivery to the BKB. The mean SPM concentration observed in the BKB under a Type 1 regime was one order of magnitude greater than the mean concentration of SPM (~ 20 mg L − 1) observed along the Lena River stream in summer 2003. Loadings of the BKB water column with particulate material vary by more than a factor of two between the two regimes. Higher partial pressure of CO 2 (p CO 2), higher concentrations of nutrients, and lower levels of oxygen saturation were observed in the bottom water near the eroded coasts, implying that coastal erosion and subsequent oxidation of eroded organic matter (OM) rather than the Lena River serves as the predominant source of nutrients to the BKB. Atmospheric CO 2 fluxes from the sea surface in the BKB vary from 1 to 95 mmol m − 2 day − 1 and are determined by specific features of hydrology and wind conditions, which change spatially, seasonally, and inter-annually. Mean values of CO 2 emission from the shallow Laptev Sea were similar in September 1999 and 2005 (7. 2 and 7. 8 mmol m − 2 day − 1, respectively), while the CO 2 efflux can be one order lower after a strong storm such as in September 2011. Atmospheric CO 2 emissions from a thawed coastal ice complex in the BKB area varied from 9 to 439 mmol m − 2 day − 1, with the mean value ranged from 75. 7 to 101 mmol m − 2 day − 1 in two years (September 2006 and 2009), suggesting that at the time of observations the eroded coastal area served as a more significant source of CO 2 to the atmosphere than the tundra (mean value: 22. 7 mmol m − 2 day − 1) on the neighboring Primorsky coastal plain (September 2006). The observed increase in the Lena River discharge since the 1990 s suggests that increased levels of "satellite-derived" annual primary production could be explained by an increasing load of humic acids delivered to shelf water; in this water the color resulting from the presence of CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter) mimics the color resulting from the presence of Chl a when seen from space. Because the BKB area can be employed as an integrator of ongoing changes in the surrounding environment, we suggest that under ongoing changes, more nutrients, products of eroded OC transformation and river transport, will be delivered to the Arctic Ocean with its shrinking ice cover, potentially increasing primary production outside of the shallow East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS). At the same time, because the ESAS is characterized by very low transparency which limits euphotic layer <b>thickness,</b> <b>excessive</b> p CO 2 will not be utilized by photosynthesis but will rather be emitted to the atmosphere at increasing rates, affecting regional CO 2 balance...|$|R
40|$|After {{a severe}} burn injury, {{patients}} {{have an increased}} catabolism that leads to loss of lean body mass and this causes muscle weakness and decreased functional capacity. The prolonged bed rest {{and the lack of}} physical activity have an important impact on recovery after burn injuries in the rehabilitation process. The most frustrating and annoying complication after a severe burn injury remains hypertrophic scar formation leading to scar contractures and decreased range of motion, a problem frequently associated with pain and itching. Accordingly, physiotherapy takes {{a crucial role in the}} treatment and rehabilitation process of burn patients and includes a variety of treatment methods such as exercise therapy, cardiopulmonary training, joint mobilization, positioning, splinting and topical scar management. However there is no consensus on the actual effect of the various treatment modalities and the evidence is not clear or even lacking. Six to 8 weeks after re-epithelialization hypertrophic scars usually develop and they are characterized by a red to deep purple color. The scar becomes more elevated and firm, hypersensitive, itchy and tends to contract. More specifically, the development of hypertrophic scarring after burn injury affects the appearance, the range of motion and compromises the skin’s protective function. Change in color, thickness and pliability (elasticity) are the most frequently reported physical features. The most important physiological characteristics of hypertrophic scars are a change in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and water content. All these parameters provide information on scar maturation, function and aesthetics of the scar and can be evaluated using scar assessment scales (such as the POSAS questionnaire) or objective scar assessment tools. However there is need for further research in reliable objective measurement tools to investigate elasticity as a physical property of a hypertrophic burn scar and TEWL and water content as physiological properties of post-burn scars. The scope of this doctoral project was threefold. The first objective was to expand the test battery for clinical and objective evaluation tools to optimize the evaluation of (burn related) scars and the assessment of different treatments and interventions and to evaluate some relevant and lacking objective assessment tools in the assessment of physical and physiological properties of burn related scars (Chapters 1 and 2). Secondly, the most frequently used non-invasive treatments of burn scars were summarized and evaluated (Chapter 3). Finally the effects of two physiotherapeutic interventions, being hydrotherapy (Chapter 4) and massage therapy (Chapter 5) using a mechanical suction device in burn scars were investigated. In Chapter 1 the reproducibility of repeated elasticity and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements with the DermaLab on 32 active burn scars and healthy skin was investigated. Results showed good ICC values (ICC ≥. 86) and rather high SEM values (SEM ≤ 0. 89) for intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of elasticity measurements. For TEWL measurements, ICC values were good (ICC ≥. 78) and SEM values were high (SEM ≤ 2. 76) for inter- and intra-observer reproducibility. There was a significant difference between the estimated mean elasticity values of normal skin and grafted scars and between normal skin and spontaneously healed scars (p ≤. 003). For the estimated mean TEWL values, there was a significant difference between normal skin and spontaneously healed scars (p =. 036). A significant negative relation was reported between mean TEWL and time after burn injury (p =. 008). In clinical trials it is necessary to interpret patient-specific changes in elasticity and TEWL with caution, since the SEMs of both modes are rather high. We therefore recommend the use of a mean of 3 repeated measurements of elasticity and TEWL to decrease the SEM. However in clinical practice the limited amount of suction of the DermaLab (elasticity mode) is an important disadvantage, thus it would not be possible to measure elasticity using the DermaLab in severe rigid scar tissue and therefore we recommend to use another suction-based device, the Cutometer. The reliability of repeated water content measurements with Corneometer on 30 (burn) scars was investigated in Chapter 2. Results revealed excellent ICC values (ICC ≥. 984) with relatively low WSCV (WSCV ≤ 10. 6 %) for intra- and inter-observer reliability. However, the Bland-Altman plot showed that more than 5 % of differences were expected to exceed 4 AU, the limit of what has been defined as a clinically acceptable difference. Results for day-by-day variability showed good ICC value (ICC =. 849) and higher WSCV (WSCV = 20. 5 %). Based on our results, we conclude that the instrument can be used in clinical trials, but only under very strict conditions with a standardized test protocol, preferably in combination with the evaluation of other physiological parameters. We recommend the use of the mean of 5 repetitive water content measurements. However if at least two values differed by more than 4 AU, we suggest an additional 6 th measurement to balance the average of the repetitive measurements. This will result in a more accurate estimate of the true value for water content. In Chapter 3 the available literature on the effects of conservative treatments of burn scars in adults was summarized. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) were sought in three databases, reference lists of retrieved articles and relevant reviews. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network scoring system was used to assess the quality of the selected studies. Twenty-two articles were included into the review and categorized in six topics: 5 on massage therapy, 4 on pressure therapy, 6 on silicone gel application, 3 on combined therapy of pressure and silicone, 3 on hydration and 1 on ultrasound. Pressure and silicone therapy are evidence-based conservative treatments of hypertrophic scar formation after a burn injury and produce clinically relevant improvement in scar thickness, redness and pliability. Massage therapy could have a positive result on scar pliability, pain and pruritus, but with less supporting evidence. The use of moisturizers and lotions can have an effect on itching, but the findings are contradictory. Of all other non-invasive treatments such as splinting, casting, physical activity, exercise and mobilisations no RCTs or CCTs were found. Chapter 4 explored for the first time the short-term effects of hydrotherapy in adults after burn injuries in a pilot comparative controlled study. Forty-two patients were allocated into one of three groups: 3 -week treatment in a spa resort (passive hydrotherapy); or 3 weeks aquatic exercise (active hydrotherapy); or only the usual care therapy. Physical and scar-related outcome measures were assessed at baseline, during intervention and at follow-up until 3 months. In active hydrotherapy group (AHT) a significant increase in hand grip strength was shown. In passive hydrotherapy group (PHT) hand grip strength decreased temporary during intervention which returned to baseline at 3 -month follow-up. In all groups there were significant improvements in redness and POSAS vascularity score over time, although a temporary increase of redness and vascularity score during the intervention in PHT group. A significant lower itching score in PHT group was found during intervention. So far, pressure and silicone therapy are the only evidence supported treatments in burn scar after care. But we believe that hydrotherapy can offer some added value to the current usual care therapy. Chapter 5 represented the effects of the depressomassage on the recovery of color and TEWL in burn scars. Depressomassage is a non-invasive massage technique using a mechanical suction device frequently used in the treatment of traumatic or burn scars. A total 43 patients were included and allocated into 2 groups. All patients received standard physical therapy, only the test group received additional depressomassage during 6 months. Color was assessed using the POSAS questionnaire (for color, vascularity and pigmentation) and the Minolta Chromameter. TEWL was measured using DermaLab. Patients of both groups were evaluated at baseline, after 1, 3 and 6 months and after 1 year. The evidence for a difference in evolution of color and TEWL between both groups was minimal. In practice, proper indications to start depressomassage have to be kept in mind. Perhaps other scar abnormalities such as decreased elasticity, increased <b>thickness,</b> <b>excessive</b> pain or itching could be the reason to start depressomassage and need to be assessed. This doctoral project made an important contribution to the test battery for clinical and objective evaluation tools to optimize the evaluation of in particular the physiological characteristics (TEWL and water content) of burn related scars and the assessment of different treatments and interventions. Based on the review, we were able to identify the effects of the most frequently used non-invasive treatments of burn scars. The effects of the two physiotherapeutic intervention studies, hydrotherapy and depressomassage, in burn patients were minimal, however these findings provided several insights for further research. nrpages: 222 status: publishe...|$|R
