5|$|Suillus americanus is {{a species}} of fungus in the Suillaceae family of mushrooms. Commonly known as the chicken fat mushroom, the American {{slippery}} Jack (or slipperycap), or the American suillus, it grows in a mycorrhizal association with eastern white pine {{and can be found}} where this tree occurs in eastern North America and China. The mushroom can be recognized by the bright yellow cap with red to reddish-brown scales embedded in slime, the large yellow angular pores {{on the underside of the}} cap, and the narrow yellow stem marked with dark reddish dots. Molecular phylogenetics analysis suggests that S.americanus may be the same species as S.sibiricus, found in western North America and western and central Asia. Suillus americanus is edible, although opinions vary as to its palatability; some susceptible individuals may suffer a contact dermatitis after touching the fruit bodies. The fruit bodies contain a beta <b>glucan</b> carbohydrate shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory properties.|$|E
25|$|Like plants, algae have cell walls. Algal cell walls contain either polysaccharides (such as {{cellulose}} (a <b>glucan))</b> or {{a variety}} of glycoproteins (Volvocales) or both. The inclusion of additional polysaccharides in algal cells walls {{is used as a}} feature for algal taxonomy.|$|E
25|$|Enterocytes {{facilitate}} the transportation of β(1,3)-glucans and similar compounds across the intestinal cell wall into the lymph, where {{they begin to}} interact with macrophages to activate immune function. Radiolabeled studies have verified that both small and large fragments of β-glucans {{are found in the}} serum, which indicates that they are absorbed from the intestinal tract. M cells within the Peyer’s patches physically transport the insoluble whole <b>glucan</b> particles into the gut-associated lymphoid tissue.|$|E
40|$|Periplasmic <b>glucans,</b> which {{exist in}} periplasmic space of many gram {{negative}} bacteria, are biologically important mole-cules in osmoregulation or pathogenesis. 1 In fact, mutants unable to synthesize the periplasmic <b>glucans</b> are impaired for growth in low osmotic condition or virulence. 2, 3 These <b>glucans</b> also have biotechnological {{applications such as}} chiral addi-tives, 4 solubility enhancers, 5 and catalysts. 6 Those applications of <b>glucans</b> {{are based on the}} structure having a complexation property with other compounds containing hydrophobic mole-cules. 7, 8 Their structures vary according to the glycosidic linkages, Degree of polymerization (DP), and the cyclic or non-cyclic forms. 1 Since there has been structural analysis on various <b>glucans,</b> 9 - 14 functional studies depending on structural variation have been expected. Herein, we report structural analysis of newly found periplasmic <b>glucans</b> isolated fro...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} initial {{characterization}} of <b>glucans</b> {{present in the}} periplasmic space of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (strain R 32). These compounds {{were found to be}} neutral, unsubstituted, and composed solely of glucose. Their size ranges from 6 to 13 glucose units/mol. Linkage studies and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses demonstrated that the <b>glucans</b> are linked by beta- 1, 2 and beta- 1, 6 glycosidic bonds. In contrast to the periplasmic <b>glucans</b> found in other plant pathogenic bacteria, the <b>glucans</b> of P. syringae pv. syringae are not cyclic but are highly branched structures. Acetolysis studies demonstrated that the backbone consists of beta- 1, 2 -linked glucose units to which the branches are attached by beta- 1, 6 linkages. These periplasmic <b>glucans</b> were more abundant when the osmolarity of the growth medium was lower. Thus, P. syringae pv. syringae appears to synthesize periplasmic <b>glucans</b> in response to the osmolarity of the medium. The structural characteristics of these <b>glucans</b> are very similar to the membrane-derived oligosaccharides of Escherichia coli, apart from the neutral character, which contrasts with the highly anionic E. coli membrane-derived oligosaccharides...|$|R
25|$|The {{synthesis}} of bacterial cellulose is a multistep process that involve two main mechanisms: the {{synthesis of}} uridine diphosphoglucose (UDPGIc), followed by the polymerization of glucose into long and unbranched chains (the β-1→4 <b>glucan</b> chain). Specifics on the cellulose synthesis has been extensively documented. The former mechanism is well known while the latter still needs exploring. The production of UDPGIc starts with carbon compounds (such as hexoses, glycerol, dihydroxyacetone, pyruvate, and dicarboxylic acids) entering the Krebs cycle, gluconeogenesis, or the pentose phosphate cycle depending on what carbon source is available. It then goes through phosphorylation along with catalysis, followed by isomerization of the intermediate, and {{a process known as}} UDPGIc pyrophosphorylase to convert the compounds into UDPGIc, a precursor to the production of cellulose. The polymerization of glucose into the β-1→4 <b>glucan</b> chain has been hypothesized to either involve a lipid intermediate or not to involve a lipid intermediate, though structural enzymology studies and in vitro experiments indicate that polymerization can occur by direct enzymatic transfer of a glucosyl moiety from a nucleotide sugar to the growing polysaccharide. A. xylinum usually converts carbon compounds into cellulose with around 50% efficiency.|$|E
25|$|This {{property}} {{arises from}} adjacently aligned <b>glucan</b> chains participating in inter- and intrachain hydrogen bonding. Bacterial cellulose subfibrils are crystallized into microfibrils which group to form bundles, that then form 'ribbons'. These fibers are two {{orders of magnitude}} thinner than cellulose fibers produced by pulping wood. Today, {{it is known that}} the pellicle comprises a random assembly of fibrils (< 130nbsp&nm wide), which are composed of a bundle of much finer microfibrils (2 to 4nbsp&nm diameter). It is also known that the pellicle gives a film or sheet when dried if the shrinkage across the plane is restricted.|$|E
500|$|Suillus americanus {{contains}} a polysaccharide {{known as a}} beta <b>glucan</b> that laboratory tests suggest may have anti-inflammatory activity. Known specifically as a (1→3)-, (1→4)-β-D-glucan, its natural function is {{as a component of}} the fungal cell wall, where it forms microcrystalline [...] in the wall that give it rigidity and strength. The anti-inflammatory activity results from the polysaccharide's ability to inhibit the production of nitric oxide in activated macrophages, a cell of the immune system.|$|E
40|$|Bacterial cyclic <b>glucans</b> are glucose {{polymers}} that concentrate {{within the}} periplasm of alpha-proteobacteria. These molecules {{are necessary to}} maintain the homeostasis of the cell envelope by contributing to the osmolarity of Gram negative bacteria. Here, we demonstrate that Brucella beta 1, 2 cyclic <b>glucans</b> are potent activators of human and mouse dendritic cells. Dendritic cells activation by Brucella beta 1, 2 cyclic <b>glucans</b> requires TLR 4, MyD 88 and TRIF, but not CD 14. The Brucella cyclic <b>glucans</b> showed neither toxicity nor immunogenicity compared to LPS and triggered antigen-specific CD 8 (+) T cell responses in vivo. These cyclic <b>glucans</b> also enhanced antigen-specific CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cell responses including cross-presentation by different human DC subsets. Brucella beta 1, 2 cyclic <b>glucans</b> increased the memory CD 4 (+) T cell responses of blood mononuclear cells exposed to recombinant fusion proteins composed of anti-CD 40 antibody and antigens from both hepatitis C virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thus cyclic <b>glucans</b> represent {{a new class of}} adjuvants, which might {{contribute to the development of}} effective antimicrobial therapies...|$|R
40|$|The {{extracellular}} glucosyltransferase {{produced by}} Streptococcus mutans 6715 was purified from culture supernatant fluids {{to a specific}} activity of 9. 6 IU/mg of protein, with an overall recovery of 87 %. The purified enzyme preparation, designated unfractionated enzyme (UFE), synthesized only water-insoluble <b>glucans</b> from sucrose during {{the initial stages of}} the reaction, although some water-soluble polymers accumulated after extended periods of incubation. It was free from measurable fructosyltransferase activity. The UFE preparation was resolved into two different catalytically active components by ethanol fractionation. One fraction (designated insoluble product enzyme [IPE]) synthesized water-insoluble <b>glucans,</b> whereas the other (designated soluble product enzyme [SPE]) produced primarily water-soluble <b>glucans.</b> The difference between the insoluble <b>glucans</b> made by the UFE preparation and those made by the IPE fraction appeared to be due to interaction of the SPE and IPE components in the UFE preparation. Addition of commercial dextrans or enzymatically prepared <b>glucans</b> to the glucosyltransferase assay altered the amounts of soluble and insoluble <b>glucans</b> synthesized by the UFE preparation. The molecular weights of the major enzymatically active proteins producing insoluble and soluble <b>glucans</b> were estimated by gel filtration chromatography to be 150, 000 and 175, 000, respectively...|$|R

The immunomodulating activities were tested in vitro, by stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and measuring of interferon-gamma (IFN-g) production by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Measurements of immunomodulatory capacity of Agaricus blazei native <b>glucans</b> showed their expressive immunostimulating effect on activated PBMCs and synthesis of IFN-g.
