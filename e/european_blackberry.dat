40|$|Rubus canduliger is {{described}} as a new regional bramble species belonging to the series Discolores. It has been recognized in the Netherlands as a distinct species for more than 70 years but identified as the central European R. grabowskii. The latter, however, differs by its tapering prickles, regular leaves with longer petiolule of the terminal leaflet, broader, often pyramidal inflorescence, and white or pink flowers with carpels hairy at the top. R. canduliger has a well-defined range north of the Rhine river around Arnhem where it occurs in urban and other disturbed habitats. Historical events, e. g. transport of young trees in the 16 th century may explain most records south of the Rhine river, 25 ¿ 50 km outside the main range. The ecology and phytosociology of the new bramble are discussed. Its distribution is compared to R. trichanthus, another regional species with a similar range as R. canduliger, but occurring in more natural habitats. In pseudogamous <b>European</b> <b>blackberries</b> (Rubus section Rubus = R. fruticosus agg.), range size is considered {{to be related to the}} age of the species. Several widespread species have disjunct distribution ranges that are suggested to be the result of long-distance dispersal by migratory birds but unintentional anthropogenic transport of seeds may be involved as well. We hypothesize that in northwestern Europe fragmentation of continuous ranges of widespread species was caused by ongoing deforestation and subsequent degradation (acidification) of originally base-rich sandy and loamy soils from the Iron Age onward. Many regional species, however, have originated and spread in the resulting man-made landscapes. A classification of range types of brambles differing in size and internal structure is presented...|$|R

A disease recorded as 'blackberry decline' was first observed in some blackberry sites in WA in 2006. A disease survey was conducted in the Manjimup-Pemberton region along the Warren and Donnelly River catchments in WA between 2010 and 2012. Phytophthora amnicola, P. bilorbang, P. cryptogea, P. inundata, P. litoralis, P. multivora, P. taxon personii, P. thermophila and a P. thermophila × amnicola hybrid were recovered from declining and adjacent decline-free sites, as well as from streams and rivers. Phytophthora cinnamomi was isolated from dying Banksia and Eucalyptus species from two non-decline sites. Of these species, P. bilorbang and P. cryptogea were more pathogenic than the others in under-bark inoculations using excised stems (primocanes), in planta primocane inoculations in blackberry growing wild in native forest stands, and in glasshouse pot trials. It was concluded that blackberry decline is a complex syndrome and Phytophthora species, in particular P. bilorbang and P. cryptogea, together with temporary inundation, are major biotic and abiotic factors contributing to blackberry decline...|$|E

The use of whole shoots or detached leaflet discs led to the same conclusions about the relative susceptibility of a blackberry clone to a particular Pv isolate. Moderate to relatively high numbers of uredinia developed on all 25 blackberry clones inoculated with isolate V 1, whereas no or few uredinia of isolates V 2 and SA 1 developed on Rubus erythrops clone EB 20, three clones of Rubus leucostachys (EB 9, EB 19 and 960804) or Rubus sp. clone SR 43. Pv isolate F 15 differed from the three isolates collected in Australia in that no or few uredinia of F 15 developed on Rubus polyanthemus clone 961107 or three clones of Rubus laciniatus (EB 22, KE 1, SR 14).

40|$|Indigenous to Europe, the {{blackberry}} rust fungus Phragmidium violaceum {{was introduced}} to Australia and subsequently appeared in New Zealand, with the most recent authorised introductions to Australia specifically for the biological control of <b>European</b> <b>blackberry.</b> Markers for ‘selective amplification of microsatellite polymorphic loci’ (SAMPL) were developed for studying the population genetics of P. violaceum. Modification {{of one of the}} two SAMPL primers with a HaeIII adapter (H) revealed significantly greater levels of genetic variation than primers used to generate AFLPs, the latter revealing little or no variation among 25 Australasian and 19 European isolates of P. violaceum. SAMPL was used to describe genetic variation among these 44 isolates of P. violaceum from 51 loci generated using primer pairs (GACA) ₄ + H–G and R 1 + H–G. The European isolates were more diverse than Australasian isolates, with 37 and 22 % polymorphic loci, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed geographic clades, with Australasian isolates forming one cluster separated from two clusters comprising the European isolates. However, low bootstrap support at these clades suggested that Australian isolates had not differentiated significantly from European isolates since the first record of P. violaceum in Australia in 1984. In general, the results support two hypotheses. First, that the population of P. violaceum in Australia was founded from a subset of individuals originating from Europe. Second, that P. violaceum in New Zealand originated from the Australian population of P. violaceum, probably by wind dispersal of urediniospores across the Tasman Sea.

40|$|Human {{activities}} {{have had an}} adverse impact on ecosystems {{on a global scale}} and have caused an unprecedented redispersal of organisms, with both plants and pathogens moving from their regions of origin {{to other parts of the}} world. Invasive plants are a potential threat to ecosystems globally, and their management costs tens of billions of dollars per annum. Rubus anglocandicans (<b>European</b> <b>blackberry)</b> is a serious invasive species in Australia. Herbicide and cultural control methods are generally inefficient or require multiple applications. Therefore, a biological control program using stem and leaf rust strains is the main option in Australia. However, biological control using rusts has been patchy, as host factors, climate, and weather can alter the impact of the rust at different locations. In 2007, Yeoh and Fontanini noticed that blackberry plants on the banks of the Donnelly and Warren rivers in the southwest of Western Australia were dying in areas that were being regularly monitored for the impact of rust as a biological control agent. The symptoms on blackberry became known as the disease “blackberry decline”.

40|$|Rubus anglocandicans is {{the most}} {{widespread}} and invasive species in the Rubus fruticosus aggregate (<b>European</b> <b>blackberry)</b> found in Australia [1]. Blackberry has been targeted by biological control since the 1980 s and most of this effort has focused on introducing exotic strains of the host‐specific leaf rust, Phragmidium violaceum. During surveys established to assess the releases of the rust fungus in 2005, dead and diseased blackberry plants were found at two locations along the Warren and Donnelly Rivers in the Manjimup region of Western Australia (P. Yeoh and L. Fontanini personal communication). The disease symptoms could not {{be attributed to the}} rust fungus and the phenomenon has been referred to as ‘blackberry decline’. The disease appears to be due to root pathogen(s) and during initial sampling several Phytophthora species were isolated. In order to investigate the cause(s) of disease and the potential role of Phytophthora species in the decline, field surveys were carried out over 2010 and 2011 in the decline and non‐decline sites along the Warren and Donnelly Rivers. During these surveys, P. taxon oaksoil was recovered from decline sites. Several isolates of this taxon have been isolated from Europe [2], and given a provisional name (oaksoil) until formal description.

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>Blackberry</b> (Rubus anglocandicans A. Newton) {{is one of}} the top 20 Weeds of National Significance in Australia. It is a major weed of {{conservation}} areas, particularly in wetter regions, and is also a major weed of forestry and agriculture. Rubus anglocandicans is the most abundant and widespread species of <b>European</b> <b>blackberry</b> in the south-west of Western Australia (WA). Herbicides and cultural control methods are generally ineffective, or require multiple applications; however, this weed is often located within inaccessible areas, which limits control options. Therefore, biological control has been identified as the main option for the control of blackberry in Australia. Biocontrol started in the 1980 s, initially with the appearance a strain of the host-specific rust Phragmidium violaceum in Victoria. This, so called “illegal strain” and later the official strain of the rust were eventually spread to WA, but they failed to provide control. The blackberry species specifically targeted was R. anglocandicans – the main species in the Manjimup-Pemberton area and along the Warren and Donnelly Rivers in the south-west of Western Australia. New strains of the rust were released in 2004 and 2005. In some areas the levels of rust developed on blackberry was high, at least initially. While monitoring for rust control, the presence of blackberry decline was noticed. The extent of the disease, with noticeable changes to vegetation structure, from an impenetrable tangle of vegetation to a parklike setting of trees and grass, following the disappearance of dense blackberry infestations, has lead to it being called “blackberry decline”. More detailed examination of the decline sites suggested that the decline was not due to the inoculated rust, but possibly due to a root pathogen. Surveys between 2010 and 2012 led to the recovery of ten different Phytophthora, nine Pythium species and Cylindrocarpon species. The surveys also identified other abiotic and biotic factors such as landforms and grazing that appear to be associated with the decline of blackberry. The Phytophthora species isolated included a new species from Phytophthora clade 6 which was described as P. bilorbang as a part of this study. The other Phytophthora species included P. cinnamomi from decline-free sites, and P. amnicola, P. cryptogea, P. inundata, P. litoralis, P. multivora, P. taxon personii, P. thermophila, and a P. thermophila-amnicola hybrid from decline sites. Primocane under-bark inoculations and pot infestation trials in the glasshouse provided evidence of the pathogenicity of P. bilorbang and P. cryptogea to R. anglocandicans. In a dual combination trial to examine synergistic effects between Phytophthora species, disease severity increased by combining at least two to three species including P. amnicola, P. bilorbang, and P. cryptogea under a regime of regular waterlogging. In an in planta under-bark inoculation trial in the field to confirm the pathogenicity of Phytophthora species in the blackberry decline with and without application of phosphite, phosphite reduced the size of lesions caused by all Phytophthora species. Extensive ‘on-ground’ surveys showed the “decline” to extend along at least 64 km of riverbank, and at present is only known from the Warren and Donnelly River Catchments. In this project, the etiology and epidemiology of the decline distribution have been investigated and a conceptual model, a “blackberry decline spiral” is proposed to describe the key factors that are hypothesised to be involved in the decline phenomenon of R. anglocandicans. This model includes predisposing, inciting and contributing factors. It is assumed that predisposing or stress factors such as periodic flooding set the stage for inciting factors (e. g. lack of genetic potential in R. anglocandicans and grazing by animals). Whilst contributing factors (e. g. Phytophthora species as root pathogens and leaf rust) included in the blackberry decline spiral all have a role in this syndrome, the involvement of the hypothesized predisposing and inciting factors are also essential for the expansion of the decline. This thesis has shown blackberry decline to be a complex syndrome made up of a number of factors, most significant of which are periodic flooding and damage to the roots by at least two Phytophthora species, P. bilorbang and P. cryptogea...|$|E
