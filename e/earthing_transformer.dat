40|$|Earthing Transformers are an {{integral}} part of power and distribution systems around the world, although, little consideration is given to their ongoing monitoring and maintenance. The failure of an <b>earthing</b> <b>transformer</b> can cause a multitude of issues including compromised stability and safety of the electrical network. The necessity to maintain both safety and stability of electrical networks highlights valuable real world applications for an SFRA <b>earthing</b> <b>transformer</b> testing toolkit. As a starting point, the project adopted a review of existing research along with an analysis of <b>earthing</b> <b>transformer</b> design principles. Research found that because of an inherent design strategy, many ZN wound earthing transformers have a unique failure type in common; axial displacement of the inner and outer windings. The second project stage involved physical simulation of an earthing transformer’s axial windings displacement using SFRA as a diagnosis tool. Simulation results provided evidence that (for the given test subject) defect detection is possible using SFRA benchmarked comparisons. Analysis of benchmarked comparisons found deviation only at select resonances with general spectral shape retention for all other points along the SFRA trace. Spectral consistency of benchmarked comparisons allowed the implementation of a speech processing technique known as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). An adaption of the MFCC process introduced a way of encoding and distilling the SFRA trace data while exaggerating critical points of deviation. The third major project stage involved the development of code using Mathworks MATLAB as a platform to the fulfil data management and computational requirements of the adapted MFCC. Select variables were isolated throughout the code to ensure that the process was tune-able on multiple levels for future optimisation. By selecting and mapping the appropriate resultant cepstral coefficients against each other, it was found that a meaningful representation of the SFRA trace can be graphically presented as a single point on a two-dimensional plot. Simulated transformer defect scenarios had notable deviation on both the x and y axis when processed and plotted together. Analysis, processing and comparison of 28 different <b>earthing</b> <b>transformer</b> SFRA traces found possible real world applications for a single point spectrum classifier. The spectrum classifier was proposed as a substitution for pre-existing subjective analysis techniques, potentially building on the communal engineering toolbox for SFRA analysis...|$|E
40|$|In Sri Lankan National Electricity Grid, severe voltage {{fluctuations}} {{have been}} {{noticed in the}} Grid Substation auxiliary supply. The auxiliary supply is quantitatively 20 CkVA, but very {{important to keep in}} good health because it provides power to all substation equipment installed in GSSs, such as battery charger units and power supply modules for various types of protective monitoring and measuring instruments. Due to these fluctuations, not only the protective equipment, but also the small power equipment such as computers, Air conditioners and substation lights are also had frequent failures. It is observed all these failures to the equipment and substation lights have been experiencedjust after the tr pping of feeders due to an earth fault. // The objective of the research is to analyze the problem of voltage fluctuations in the auxiliary supply in Grid Substations and find the possible remedies. The studies presented in this report are mainly focused on the <b>Earthing</b> <b>Transformer,</b> which provides the power to the Auxiliary equipments. The earthing transformers in bulk of the GSSs are a Zig-Zag wound transformer with an low voltage auxiliary winding. // Unfortunately, there are no models for Zig-Zag transformer readily available for simulation of the problem using computer software. Therefore the purpose of simulation of the problem in this report is mainly based on a Prototype transformer, which was wound specifically for the purpose. // The possible cause to the voltage surges experienced in the auxiliary supply at an earth fault is due to the extra flux in the grounding transformer limbs and the leakage flux of primary windings directly influencing the auxiliary winding, resulting an extra voltage induced in the auxiliary winding. The arrangement of the winding in each limb has made a huge impact on the problem. // The integration of two functions has created a negative impact on the performance of the transformer. As a solution, firstly, this report suggest to split the two functions integrated in the grounding transformer i e use separate transformer for grounding the 33 kV side of the GSS and an other separate transformer for auxiliary and control supply for the GSS. Secondly, re-arrange the windings {{in such a way that}} the no resultant flux induces due to the fault current injected into the neutral of the grounding transforme...|$|E

The near DC currents may cause half-cycle saturation of transformers, possibly causing relay misoperation, increased reactive power demand and damage to transformers. This paper describes a patented idea {{to make a}} transformer immune to GIC using compensation windings in each phase. A compensation winding has {{one third of the}} turns of the main winding it protects and the three windings are connected in series between neutral point and earth. Time simulations demonstrate that the principle is effective for single-phase transformers, which is the transformer type most sensitive to GIC. It is also shown that the function is affected neither by active and reactive load current nor by high GIC levels. GIC immunity is of particular interest for key transformers, as in large power plants, at the power system periphery, where GIC levels are in general higher...|$|R

40|$|In the {{classical}} approach, line-to-line faults are usually analysed using a parallel connection of symmetrical component sequence networks. The sequence networks are solved separately, {{and then the}} positive and negative sequence networks are connected in parallel for a line-to-line fault, and solved to obtain the phase quantities. The solution proceeds by identifying the connection of the sequence networks at the fault point and then solving for the symmetrical component currents and voltages.

40|$|<b>Earthing</b> of Distribution <b>Transformer</b> is very {{important}} in the sense of safety and protection of human beings, livestock and equipment. The construction personals have faced critical issues on earthing when they engage in Installations of Electrical equipment due to high values of earth resistance. The research was carried out to find solutions for two objectives. One of objectives is to design an earthing system for high resistive soil. The other objective is to find solution for earthing in restricted area. It was found that high resistive soil exists in sandy soils in coastal areas as well as hard rocky areas in central part of the Island. There are some rocks located in coastal area too. The soil resistivity plays vital role in earthing of electrical installations. Thus the research was done by using soil enhancement materials such as Charcoal, Lime and Sand of the same location. The mixture of above materials improves the electrolytic property of soil to bring down soil resistivity. The research was done in the field and at laboratory by varying the ratios of Charcoal, Lime and Sand. The test results showed that resistivity becomes minimum value, when the ratio becomes 1 : 1 : 3. of Charcoal: Lime and Sand respectively. The usage of optimum land area for <b>earthing</b> of distribution <b>transformers</b> were achieved by using the base of poles of transformer structure as alternative earth pits. A new design for earth mesh for pole base earth pits was introduced {{as a result of the}} research. An economic analysis was carried out to find the benefits of using soil enhancement materials instead of cement block earths. As a result of eliminating cement block earth, there is a financial gain of 18. 39 %. The case studies were carried in Chilaw area for two different soil types by mixing soil enhancement materials. In this study moisture content of the soil was measured to identify the effect of presence of moisture in soil. The results of the research indicated that the earth resistance drastically reduces due to the presence of moisture content and the organic substances of the soil in addition to the soil enhancement material. Finally, the Ansys-Maxwell software was used for simulate the earthing system in homogeneous medium. The results of simulation were shown that major portion of the energy absorbed by the narrow region, very close to the earth rod. Therefore, the diameter of the earth pit can be reduced to minimize the area of land required for <b>earthing</b> of distribution <b>transformers.</b> It shows the voltage distribution and energy dissipation in the critical cylinder very clearly. In this research a new conceptual design was carried out to reduce earth resistance in newly designed earthing system and in existing transformers by increasing the moisture content around the earth rods of earth pits.

More over, failures due to transient overvoltages {{and its impact on the}} reliability of the network are analyzed in this study. Lightning may cause flashovers from direct strokes or induced voltage from nearby strokes. Direct lightning to power distribution lines causes insulation flashovers in great majority of the cases. Therefore the goal of this research is to estimate the lightning performance level of feeder lines and investigate improvements. Shielding effect from nearby trees, critical flashover voltages for different flashover paths and deterioration of insulation with aging are also discussed. Thus the analysis of lightning related incidents such as transformer failures, arrester failures and nuisance fuse blows are presented. The study of transformer installation reveals that arrester lead length becomes critical during a lightning discharge since it generates high voltage stress in the winding which may fail the distribution <b>transformer.</b> <b>Earth</b> rod impulse resistance is also an important parameter which increases the voltage stress. It is necessary to develop models, using, electrical parameters for simulation of transient overvoltages. The PSCAD software is especially developed to study transient simulations of power systems.

Further, simulation of surge arrester performance and nuisance fuse blows are also presented. Finally, the study presents applications to achieve zero lead length in substation, introduction of surge durable fuses and procedures which can be implemented to improve lightning performance in the MV network...|$|R
