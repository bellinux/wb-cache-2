50|$|The {{most common}} example is {{selective}} leaching of zinc from brass alloys containing more than 15% zinc (<b>dezincification)</b> {{in the presence}} of oxygen and moisture, e.g. from brass taps in chlorine-containing water. It is believed that both copper and zinc gradually dissolve out simultaneously, and copper precipitates back from the solution. The material remaining is a copper-rich sponge with poor mechanical properties, and a color changed from yellow to red. <b>Dezincification</b> can be caused by water containing sulfur, carbon dioxide, and oxygen.

50|$|Exterior {{corrosion}} resistance in a heat exchanger {{is especially important}} in coastal areas, humid areas, polluted areas, and in mining operations. Corrosion mechanisms of copper and aluminium alloys are different. CuproBraze tube contains 85% copper which provides high resistance against <b>dezincification</b> and stress corrosion cracking. The copper alloys tend to corrode uniformly over entire surfaces at known rates. This predictability of copper corrosion is important for proper maintenance management. Aluminium, on the other hand, {{is more likely to}} corrode locally by pitting, resulting eventually in holes.|$|E

Applications with high water temperatures, chlorides present, or deviating water qualities (soft water) play a role. DZR-brass is excellent in water boiler systems. This brass alloy must be produced with great care, with special attention placed on a balanced composition and proper production temperatures and parameters to avoid long-term failures.|$|E

Generally, builders and manufacturers have learned from these experiences and have found the best materials for use in fittings used to connect pipe with connectors, valves and other fittings. But there were problems reported with a specific type of brass fitting used in connection with installations in Nevada that caused a negative interaction between its mineral-rich hard water and so-called [...] "yellow brass" [...] fittings. Zinc in the fittings leached into the pipe material in a chemical reaction known as <b>dezincification,</b> causing some leaks or blockages. A solution was to replace the yellow brass fittings, which had 30% zinc, with red brass fittings, which had 5% to 10% zinc. It led California building authorities to insist on fittings made from [...] "red brass" [...] which typically has a lower zinc content, and is unlikely to cause problems in the future since problems with these specific fittings have become known.|$|E

40|$|Although brasses are {{resistant}} to several forms of corrosion, they are susceptible to <b>dezincification</b> – selective dissolution of zinc – which {{may be responsible for}} failures in service of casting brass products.

40|$|The {{inhibition}} {{behavior of}} chromate ions towards corrosion and <b>dezincification</b> of &# 945;-brass (Cu/Zn: 64 / 36) in acetate buffer solutions (pH 2. 4, 7. 0 and 8. 5) containing 3 % sodium chloride was studied. Weight loss and solution analysis {{were used for}} a long period (four weeks) and electrochemical polarization for a short period (one hour). Chromate accelerated corrosion and <b>dezincification</b> at pH 2. 4 by acting as depolarizer but chromate suppressed efficiently the corrosion and <b>dezincification</b> at pH 8. 5. At pH 7. 0 the corrosion and <b>dezincification</b> suppressed in the presence of chromate but the inhibition action started to deteriorate at chromate concentration less than 0. 005 mol/L. The inhibition effect is attributed to adsorption of chromate ions on the corroding surface and improvement of the passivity. Chromate led to an increase in the concentration of copper species in solution due to the formation of the more soluble CuCrO 4 than Cu 2 O, which contributed to the apparent suppression of <b>dezincification...</b>|$|E

There is no reliable method of inhibiting the <b>dezincification</b> of two-phase brass despite there are some protection methods such as inhibitors, electro deposition and electro polymerization.

40|$|The present paper {{addresses}} {{the effectiveness of}} 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) in preventing the <b>dezincification</b> of brass in sulfide polluted 3. 5 % NaCl solution. The <b>dezincification</b> behaviour of brass in 3. 5 % NaCl solution containing 100 - 1000 ppm of sulfide ions and 1 x 10 - 6 to 1 x 10 - 3 M MBT was studied by potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, current-time transient and accelerated leaching studies. The presence of sulfide ions in 3. 5 % NaCl solution has caused {{a significant increase in}} the extent of corrosion attack on brass. The inhibiting effect of MBT is markedly reduced in the presence of sulfide ions in the medium. The easy replacement of Cu-MBT complex by Cu 2 S film on the surface of brass is responsible for the inability of MBT to prevent corrosion attack in the presence of sulfide ions. The study concludes that the effectiveness of MBT in preventing the <b>dezincification</b> of brass is dependent on the concentration of the sulfide ions in the medium and the effectiveness is nullified at higher concentrations of sulfide ions...|$|E
30|$|Brass {{artefacts}} {{are well}} known for being less hard and less corrosion resistant than bronze artefacts [25]. Brass alloys are subject to <b>dezincification</b> in which zinc is selectively leached. Zinc is either deposited as an insoluble compound or carried away as a soluble salt, while copper is re-deposited at the alloy surface in a porous form [26]. Objects showing zinc depletion represent the majority (64 %) although {{there is still a}} significant percentage of objects showing zinc enrichment (36 %). Corrosion studies on Roman coins have previously shown that the presence of alloy tin limits <b>dezincification</b> [27]. This may also explain the significant percentage of Vechten objects showing zinc enrichment.|$|E
30|$|In {{the case}} of Reading pastor two factors {{play a role in}} the {{reactivity}} of the brass pigment. On the one hand the presence of chlorine and on the other the high content in zinc. The presence of highly mobile anions such as chloride are known to accelerate the corrosion process [8, 9]. Brasses with substantial amounts of zinc (above 15 %) become destabilized and lose zinc by <b>dezincification</b> [10] with a preferential initial formation of zinc corrosion products. The heterogeneous distribution of zinc and copper soaps in the agglomerates and the structure of the metal foil surface could be suggestive of <b>dezincification</b> of the brass alloy prior to the formation of soaps.|$|E

This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by mapping sixteen annealingconditions and three different brass alloy compositions to their respective microstructure anddezincification performance. It was found that high <b>dezincification</b> depth was a result ofannealing temperatures at 300 °C – 400 °C, which promoted precipitation of intermetallicAlAs-particles along grain boundaries, twins and lead particles as well as precipitation of β-phase along grain boundaries.

40|$|By {{directly}} heating a surface-dezincified polycrystalline brass (Cu 70 Zn 30 alloy) {{in ambient}} conditions, semiconductor nanostructure networks composed of CuO nanofilm and ZnO nanowires {{have been successfully}} fabricated. The <b>dezincification</b> induced by metallographic etching on Cu 70 Zn 30 polycrystalline alloy surface created heterogeneous networks composed of individual Cu-rich micrograin surfaces and surrounding grain boundaries. The comparative thermal oxidation investigations show distinct growth of semiconductor nanowire/nanofilm network junctions on dezincified Cu 70 Zn 30 substrates compared to the randomZnO nanowires growth on nonetched brass substrates. The grain boundary region is mostly dominated byZnO nanowires, while each grain surface was overgrown withCuOnanofilm, forming nanowire/nanofilm network junctions. The different growth habits of ZnO nanowires and CuO nanofilms are due to composition and geometry distribution difference between dezincified Cu 70 Zn 30 grain surface and grain boundary, resulting in heterogeneous surface oxidation kinetics of Cu and Zn element. The surface <b>dezincification</b> and selective oxidation process could provide a new approach for heterogeneous nanostructure design, fabrication, and control.
