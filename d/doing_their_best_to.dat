Rewards differed depending on the mission - from cash, gems to esoteric hardware such as a cloaking device.|$|E

Taunton, in spite of Massey's efforts to keep the field, was again besieged. In Wilts and Dorset, numerous bands of Clubmen were on foot, which the King's officers were <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> turn into troops for their master. But the process of collecting a fresh royal army was slow, and Goring and his subordinate, Sir Richard Grenville, were alienating the King's most devoted adherents by their rapacity, cruelty and debauchery.|$|E

Fisher, {{writing in}} The New York Times, stated that {{millions}} of American women in the 19th century organised [...] "every aspect of their lives [...]. {{as much as possible}} in imitation of the Queen", and that The Modern Cook sold almost as well in America as it did in England.

She observed that at Windsor Castle, Francatelli and other royal chefs were assisted by 24 assistant chefs and two [...] "Yeomen of the Kitchen", not to mention a multitude of [...] "servers and lackeys".

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his role as series creator, Akira Toriyama is also credited for the [...] "original story and character design concepts" [...] of the new anime originally directed by Kimitoshi Chioka.

2500|$|Though {{informed}} by issues of recent national importance, the two-sided political culture of Norwich in the 1790s cannot be totally disconnected from local tradition. Two features {{stand out from}} a political continuum of three centuries. The first is the dichotomous power balance. From at least {{the time of the}} Reformation, there is a record of Norwich as a [...] "two-party city". In the mid-16th century the weaving parishes actually fell under the control of opposition forces, as Kett's rebels held the north of the river, in support of poor cloth workers. Secondly, {{there seems to be a}} case for saying that with this tradition of two-sided disputation, the city had over a long period of time developed an infrastructure, evident in her many cultural and institutional networks of politics, religion, society, news media and the arts, whereby argument could be managed short of outright confrontation. Indeed at a time of hunger and tension on the Norwich streets, with the alehouse crowds ready to have [...] "a Minister's head brought to the block", the Anglican and Dissenting clergy were <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> conduct a collegiate dialogue, seeking common ground, and reinforcing the same well-mannered civic tradition of consensus as that illustrated by historians of earlier periods.|$|E
