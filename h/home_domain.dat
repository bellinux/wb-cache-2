40|$|AbstractFeature Interaction is {{a problem}} mostly {{considered}} in the telecommunications domain. Many solutions for detecting interactions between telephony features have been reported. In this paper, we investigate the feature interaction problem beyond the traditional telecommunications domain and look at interactions between policies in other domains. We propose the use of semi-formal methods for detecting interactions between policies in the smart <b>homes</b> <b>domain.</b> The novelty {{of this research is}} threefold: firstly, a six step semi-formal approach, called IRIS (Identifying Requirements Interactions using Semi-formal methods), for detecting interactions is presented. A major component within IRIS, which is an interaction taxonomy, is also presented. Secondly, we extend the scope of the problem of feature interactions beyond telecommunication features and investigate interactions between policies in the smart <b>homes</b> <b>domain.</b> Thirdly, in order to show how IRIS is used to detect interactions between policies, a case study of the smart <b>homes</b> <b>domain</b> is conducted. A complete description of the results obtained is also provided. Our approach was successfully applied to the smart <b>homes</b> <b>domain</b> and was able to discover 83 interactions among 35 user policies using only 525 pairwise comparisons as opposed to 630 a human expert would have to do. These results support the paper’s main claim of being able to use the semi-formal approach IRIS to detect interactions between policies. Furthermore, these results are to date the most complete publication of interactions between policies in the smart <b>homes</b> <b>domain...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} validates {{the use of}} a spirituality based Blue light Muraqaba Meditation (BLMM) {{intervention to}} positively affect work family interaction, stress and job & home outcomes. The dissertation comprise of two related studies on the subject. In the first study, interrelationship among study variables is examined for the purpose of substantiating the existing reference points. Furthermore the objective was to produce indigenous empirical evidence that may be helpful in explaining the effects of proposed meditation based intervention. The variables include two dimensions of work family interaction (WFI) i. e. work family conflict(WFC) and work family facilitation (FWF). WFC has been studied across job and <b>home</b> <b>domains</b> i. e. work interference with family (WIF) & family interference with work (FIW). Similarly work family facilitation includes work facilitation with family (WFF) and family facilitation with work (FFW). WFI has been conceptualized as a precursor variable to stress and employee outcomes. Stress includes two types of negative and positive stress and termed as Â� stress. & Â� stress. respectively in this dissertation. Work outcomes studied in the dissertation include motivation, performance and satisfaction across job and <b>home</b> <b>domains.</b> Work family interaction, both types of stress, motivation, performance and satisfaction across job and <b>home</b> <b>domains</b> are collectively termed as study variables. In the first study, data is collected from a sample of 291 employees of different organizations in service sector. Structured equation modeling has been used to test the fit of six proposed models and to validate the hypothetical relationships among study variables. In the second study, a Blue Light Muraqaba meditation (BLMM) intervention is implemented in a service sector organization to gauge its effect on work family interaction, stress and outcomes. This study integrates the conceptually rich theories of work family interaction and spirituality to propose and empirically test the possible beneficial effects of BLMM intervention on study variables. Data is collected from a sample of 60 employees through a daily diary study of four weeks, using pretest posttest control group design. Multivariate analysis of variance and related procedures has been used to identify the effect of BLMM intervention on work family interaction, stress and outcomes. Empirical evidence gathered through experiment is explained in the light of first studyÂ�es results and the finding from the previous research on meditation and study variables. It is concluded that BLMM intervention could be effective in reducing WFC and nurturing FWF. BLMM intervention can also reduce pull stress and induce push stress and has beneficial effects on motivation, performance and satisfaction across job and <b>home</b> <b>domains.</b> Because of the scale and scope of the current study, the results cannot be generalized and findings remain somewhat tentative. However, this study opens new doors of scientific inquiry in the Â�. domain of work family interaction, stress, motivation, performance and satisfaction across job and <b>home</b> <b>domains...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{understand}} the reasons for employees’ personal Internet use at work, known as cyber loafing, this paper attempts a new perspective {{to look at the}} phenomenon.

40|$|Choice or Constraint {{ideas have}} {{dominated}} theoretical {{approaches to the}} study of women’s lives. Preference theory, postulated by Hakim (1996; 2000) contrasts with the ‘constraints ideology’ evident in the work of Walby (1990) and Crompton (1997; 2006). This study revisits this dichotomy with the purpose of a thematic exploration of the stories of a group of working mothers in Ireland. The lived experiences of working mothers are thematically explored using a sample of 11 mothers who work in paid employment outside the home. Significant themes illuminate the role of maternal grandmothers and husbands/partners in the mothers’ search for balance between their home and work lives A biographical narrative approach is adopted within this study within an interpretive phenomenological epistemology where, through in-depth interviews, working mothers explore their experiences of work and <b>home</b> <b>domains.</b> Data presented is evidenced from two qualitative interviews with each participant; one in Spring 2009 and interview two in Autumn 2009. The creative use of second interviews creates a conversational space in which the mothers reflected on their daily lives as they cope with ‘competing devotions’ (Blair-Loy 2003) of work and home. This study highlights that while working mothers make choices with regard to paid work outside the home they do so within constraints. Given the competing devotions (Blair-Loy 2003) of <b>home</b> and work <b>domains</b> faced by working mothers, many of the working mothers in this study did take up formal work-life balance initiatives, while others relied on informal work-life balance supports from line managers and colleagues in particular. Despite these work-life supports the working mothers in this study not only faced the responsibilities of ‘the second shift’ (Hochschild 1989) but also evidenced the presence of ‘the third shift’ (Hochschild 1997; Kremen Bolton 2000) in their daily negotiations between choice or constraint across work and <b>home</b> <b>domains.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

50|$|During the Edo Period {{under the}} Tokugawa shogunate most Japanese {{people could not}} travel outside of their <b>home</b> <b>domain.</b> As a result, {{regional}} Japanese dialects were relatively isolated and became increasingly distinct. After the Meiji Restoration the government, in emulation of the European nation states, sought to create a standard Japanese speech.

By the early twentieth century, the Ministry of Education and other authorities instituted various policies to reduce or suppress regional differences.|$|E

40|$|As women, and {{particularly}} mothers, {{have increased their}} labor force participation in the last half-century, and as the expectation for men {{to spend more time}} in childcare and housework has increased, more men and women now must combine role responsibilities in the work and <b>home</b> <b>domains</b> than ever before. Using quantitative and qualitative data, this dissertation takes a sociological approach to understanding the variation in experiences at the work-home interface that have arisen in this time of substantial social change. In assessing how taking on work-home roles can influence individual outcomes, I show {{that it is important to}} consider both within- and between-gender differences at the work-home interface, and highlight the utility of applying a life course perspective to work-family research. The first empirical chapter uses two waves of a national sample of working adults to document how transitions in family roles are related to perceptions of work spilling over into home, and home spilling over into work, and how these associations differ by gender. This chapter provides evidence that taking on dual work-home role responsibilities can produce both role strain and role enhancement, laying the groundwork for future studies of how strain and enhancement might combine rather than compete. The second empirical chapter uses data from qualitative interviews with medical trainees to show how competing devotions to work, family, and personal lives shape the way important career decisions are made. The third empirical chapter uses nationally-representative and longitudinal data to document the association between working, parenting, and long-term health trajectories. Taken together, these studies suggest that social policy agendas should consider the ways in which work and <b>home</b> <b>domains</b> are linked, as well as focus on important turning points across the life course. Policy efforts to mitigate gender inequality in the labor force would do well to continue to push for gender-neutral work-family policies, as it is clear that conflict at the work-home interface is not a solely female experience, and that both men and women navigate and seek solutions for complex work-home dilemmas across the life course...|$|R

The moderating role of gender in these relationships was also investigated. Consistent with the hypotheses, the results revealed that managerial support and spousal support have negative effects on work-family conflict.
