50|$|In large {{castings}} it is economical to use {{two different}} sands, {{because the majority}} of the sand will not be in contact with the casting, so it does not need any special properties. The sand that is in contact with the casting is called <b>facing</b> <b>sand,</b> and is designed for the casting on hand. This sand will be built up around the pattern to a thickness of 30 to 100 mm. The sand that fills in around the <b>facing</b> <b>sand</b> is called backing sand. This sand is simply silica sand with only a small amount of binder and no special additives.|$|E

40|$|Received 18. 02. 2013; {{accepted}} in revised form 07. 05. 2013 More and more foundry plants applying moulding sands with water-glass or its substitutes for obtaining the high-quality casting surface at the smallest costs, {{consider the possibility}} of implementing two-layer moulds, in which e. g. the <b>facing</b> <b>sand</b> is a sand with an organic binder (no-bake type) and the backing sand is a sand with inorganic binder. Both kinds of sands must have the same chemical reaction. The most often applied system is the moulding sand on the water-glass or geopolymer bases – as the backing sand and the moulding sand from the group of self-hardening sands with a resol resin – as the <b>facing</b> <b>sand.</b> Investigations were performed for the system: moulding sand with inorganic GEOPOL binder or moulding sand with water glass (as a backing sand) and moulding sand, no-bake type, with a resol resin originated from various producers: Rezolit AM, Estrofen, Avenol NB 700 (as a <b>facing</b> <b>sand).</b> The LUZ apparatus, produced by Multiserw Morek, was adapted for investigations. A special partition with cuts was mounted in the attachment for making test specimens for measuring the tensile strength. This partition allowed a simultaneous compaction of two kinds of moulding sands. After 24 hours of hardening the highest values were obtained for the system: Geopol binder- Avenol resin...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{characteristics}} of used sodium silicate sand and the different use requirements for recycled sand, "dry reusing and wet reclaiming of used sodium silicate sand" is considered as the most suitable technique for the used sand. When the recycled sand is used as support sand, the used sand is only reused by dry process including breaking, screening, dust-removal, etc., and it is not necessary that the used sand is reclaimed with strongly rubbing and scraping method, but when the recycled sand is used as <b>facing</b> <b>sand</b> (or single sand), the used sand must be reclaimed by wet method for higher removal rate of the residual binders. The characteristics and the properties of the dry reused sand are compared with the wet reclaimed sand after combining the different use requirements of support sand and <b>facing</b> <b>sand</b> (or single sand), and above the most adaptive scheme has also been validated...|$|E

40|$|This paper deals {{about the}} study of {{deformation}} behaviour of geotextile reinforced slopes subjected to differential settlements. A special device for inducing differential settlements during centrifuge test for a reinforced soil structure has been designed and calibrated. In order to simulate the failure to reinforcement layers ratio of length of the reinforcement to height is maintained as 0. 85 and the slope is constructed with a scaled-down geotextile material by using a wrap-around technique to represent a flexible <b>facing.</b> <b>Sand</b> with 85 % relative density was used as structural fill material. Two centrifuge model tests were carried-out at 40 g on geotextile reinforced sand slopes by varying the type of reinforcement and by maintaining slope inclination (2 V: 1 H), vertical spacing of reinforcement layers as constant. Results of the centrifuge test indicate that even after inducing a central settlement equivalent to 1. 0 m in prototype dimensions, the geotextile reinforced slope retains its integrity...|$|E

40|$|Steel casts in Z. N. POMET were {{produced}} in moulds {{made of the}} moulding sand Floster. This sand did not have good knocking outproperties, required a significant binder addition (4. 5 - 5. 0 parts by weight), and the casting surface quality gave rise to clients objections. Therefore a decision of implementing two-layer moulds, in which the <b>facing</b> <b>sand</b> would consist of the moulding sand with an alkalineorganic binder while the backing sand would {{be made of the}} moulding sand with an inorganic binder also of an alkaline character - wasundertaken. The fraction of this last binder in the moulding sand mass would be smaller than that of the binder used up to now (waterglass). The application of two moulding sands of the same chemical character (highly alkaline) should facilitate the reclamation processand improve the obtained reclaimed material quality, due to which {{it would be possible to}} increase the reclaim fraction in the mouldingsand (up to now it was 50 %). The results of the laboratory investigations of sands with the RUDAL binder are presented in the paper...|$|E

The morphological and chemical characterization of the fish-eye defects have been performed by light optical microscopy (LOM) and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS).

50|$|Grain flow - Grains in {{the flow}} are kept in {{suspension}} by grain-to-grain interactions, with the fluid acting only as a lubricant. As such, the grain-to-grain collisions generate a dispersive pressure that helps prevent grains from settling out of suspension. Although common in terrestrial environments on the slip <b>faces</b> of <b>sand</b> dunes, pure grain flows are rare in subaqueous settings. However, grain-to-grain interactions in high-density turbidity currents are very important as a contributing mechanism of sediment support.|$|R

40|$|Frost {{penetration}} increases upslope on barren, windswept bluffs in cold environments. Along {{the south}} shore of Lake Superior, near the brow of 100 m high bluffs it typically exceeds 5 m. Frost increases the shear strength of damp sand to a level {{comparable to that of}} concrete, making winter slopes highly stable despite undercutting by waves and ground-water sapping along the footslope. Sublimation of interparticle ice in the slope face increases with wind speed and lower vapor pressures. The cold and dry winter winds of Lake Superior ablate these slopes through loss of binding ice. Wind erosion rates, based on measurements of sand accumulation on the forest floor downwind of the brow, show most airborne sand falls out within several meters of the brow, forming a berm 1 to 3 m high after many years. The spatial pattern of sand deposition, however, varies considerably over distances of several hundred meters along the top bluffs in response to frost conditions and the build-up of gravel lag on the slope <b>face,</b> <b>sand</b> exposure from mass movements, and local aerodynamics of the crest slope. The formation of perched sand dunes in the Great Lakes region is clearly related to wind erosion of sand from high bluffs in winter. Broadly similar processes may operate on Mars...|$|R
