50|$|A {{ducted fan}} is a {{propulsion}} arrangement whereby a mechanical fan, {{which is a}} type of propeller, is mounted within a cylindrical shroud or duct. The duct reduces losses in thrust from the tips of the props, and varying the cross-section of the duct allows the designer to advantageously affect the velocity and pressure of the airflow according to Bernoulli's Principle. <b>Ducted</b> fan <b>propulsion</b> is used in aircraft, airships, airboats, hovercraft and fan packs.|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} {{benefit of}} boundary layer or wake ingestion on marine and air vehicles {{has been well}} documented and explored. In this article, a quasi-one-dimensional boundary layer ingestion (BLI) benefit analysis for subsonic and transonic propulsion systems is performed using a control volume of a <b>ducted</b> <b>propulsion</b> system that ingests the boundary layer developed by the external airframe surface. To illustrate the BLI benefit, a relationship between the amount of BLI and the net thrust is established and analyzed for two propulsor types. One propulsor is an electric fan, and the other is a pure turbojet. These engines can be modeled as a turbofan with an infinite bypass ratio for the electric fan, and with a zero bypass ratio for the pure turbojet. The analysis considers two flow processes: a boundary layer being ingested by an aircraft inlet and a shock wave {{sitting in front of the}} inlet. Though the two processes are completely unrelated, both represent a loss of total pressure and velocity. In real applications, it is possible to have both processes occurring in front of the inlet of a transonic vehicle. Preliminary analysis indicates that the electrically driven propulsion system benefits most from the boundary layer ingestion and the presence of transonic shock waves, whereas the benefit for the turbojet engine is near zero or negative depending on the amount of total temperature rise across the engine...|$|R

Aerodynamic calculations {{were based on a}} four-stage Runge-Kutta time-marching finite volume solution technique with added numerical dissipation. An implicit residual smoothing operator was used to aid convergence. Two calculation grids were employed in this study. The first grid utilized an H-type mesh network with a branch cut opening to represent the axisymmetric cowl. The second grid utilized a multiple-block mesh system with a C-type grid about the cowl. The individual blocks were numerically coupled in the Euler solver. Grid systems were generated by a combined algebraic/elliptic algortihm developed specifically for ducted propfans. Numerical calculations were initially performed for unducted propfans to verify the accuracy of the three-dimensional Euler formulation. The Euler analyses were then applied for the calculation of ducted propfan flows, and predicted results were compared with experimental data for two cases. The three-dimensional Euler analyses displayed exceptional accuracy, although certain parameters were observed to be very sensitive to geometric deflections.

The engines switched to an improved {{variant of the}} MA-1 system with bell-shaped thrust chambers and 150,000 pounds of thrust, also the verniers {{were added to the}} autopilot loop for the first time. The APS (Auxiliary Power System) ceased operating at liftoff due to improper disconnect of a pad umbilical. At T+108 seconds, the engines started oscillating in all three axes and at T+117 seconds, the B-1 engine shut down. One second later, the B-2 engine shut down. The Atlas broke up at T+163 seconds. The failure was attributed to a short in the vernier engine feedback transducer which caused the unexpected engine oscillation, but the actual loss of thrust was believed to be due to a turbopump failure. Missile 11A {{was launched}} from LC-12 on February 20. This was the first flight where a roll program was added to the autopilot. Once again, the vernier feedback transducer shorted, leading to complete loss of control at T+109 seconds.

40|$|Personal Air Vehicles (PAVs) are envisaged to be {{the next}} logical step in {{mobility}} to alleviate modern transport problems. PAVs could combine the freedom of point-to-point personal mobility with the higher speeds of air travel. Hence the principal aim of this research programme was to develop a preliminary design and optimisation methodology for an innovative vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) PAV with a <b>ducted</b> fan <b>propulsion</b> system driven by a single turboshaft engine. A feasibility study conducted {{at the start of the}} programme concluded that a ducted fan powered VTOL PAV provides a flexible, quiet and safe point-to-point mobility platform free from runway constraints and any problems associated with jet efflux or exposed rotating components. To satisfy VTOL and forward flight requirements a design and optimisation methodology for ducted fans and contra-rotating lift fans was developed from a series CFD tests. With a single engine driving all the fans, a methodology was developed for the design of a system of interconnecting gears, gearboxes and shafts. To accommodate the propulsion system and all the other internal components of the aircraft, an innovative tri-surface configuration was generated by adopting a systems packaging approach. Weight minimisation through the use of composites and appropriate prediction methods was crucial to reducing the power requirements and fuel consumption. The aerodynamic surface interaction was explored and optimised using a vortex-lattice method. The same approach was also used to estimate the stability derivatives of the aircraft. The overall performance was analysed utilising the data produced from the above methodologies and that also included an analysis of the transition from hover to forward flight. All the above methodologies were integrated to form an automated PAV design synthesis which in combination with a MATLAB global optimiser is capable of producing variants of the baseline aircraft that are capable of meeting different mission and passenger capacity requirements while maximising a specified merit function.

40|$|Efficiency of an {{axial fan}} unit used in <b>ducted</b> fan based <b>propulsion</b> systems {{is closely related}} to its tip leakage mass flow rate and the level of tip/casing interactions. The present {{experimental}} study uses a stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimeter to quantify the three dimensional mean flow observed at just downstream of a ducted fan unit. After a comprehensive description of the tip leakage influenced fan exit flow, a number of tip treatments based on pressure side extensions are introduced. Various tip leakage mitigation schemes are introduced by varying the chordwise location and the width of the extension in the circumferential direction. The current study shows that a proper selection of the pressure side bump location and width are the two critical parameters influencing the success of tip leakage mitigation. Significant gains in axial mean velocity component are observed when a proper pressure side tip extension is used. It is also observed that a proper tip leakage mitigation scheme significantly reduces the tangential velocity component near the tip of the axial fan blade. Reduced tip clearance interactions are essential in improving the energy efficiency of ducted fan systems. Aeroacoustic gains are also possible. A reduction or elimination of the momentum deficit in tip vortex structures are also expected to reduce the adverse performance effects originating from the unsteady and highly turbulent tip leakage flows rotating against a stationary casing...|$|R
40|$|Ducted {{propellers}} {{find their}} application {{in a wide}} range of marine vessels, such as cargo ships, tugboats, submarines, trawlers etc. Preference over the open propeller depends on a variety of factors, the most common being increased thrust at high propeller loadings. Different duct designs have been developed based on the operational requirements, the most popular type being the accelerating duct. With the entire marine industry pushing for energy efficiency and optimized design each passing day, it has been imperative to evaluate certain aspects which had not typically been classified as ‘design criteria’, but, bear the prospect of influencing the actual performance of the propulsion unit, and hence, the operation of the vessel for which they are employed. One important aspect is related to the nature of the sea itself. For most of its life span, a vessel has to operate in waves, and hence the hydrodynamics of the propulsion unit might be strongly affected by sea conditions, which is not calm water, as used as design condition. The first part of this work focusses on the behaviour of a cargo vessel in waves, when propelled by a ducted propeller. The main point of interest is the hydrodynamic behaviour, which includes the added resistance, motions, and accelerations of the vessel in presence of waves. The study is based on results from model seakeeping tests, as well as a linear strip theory based potential flow solver ShipX Veres. The influence of the duct has been evaluated by comparison of the behaviour of the same vessel propeller by an open propeller of similar design. It was found that- the duct has very little influence on the seakeeping properties for the large cargo vessel. However, interesting differences have been observed between the propulsion factors in waves for the open and <b>ducted</b> <b>propulsion</b> cases, in spite of much similar calm water characteristics. A very striking feature for the ducted propeller is the significant increase in the propulsion point effective wake fraction in waves compared to calm water conditions. The other aspect of investigation in this work is the scale effect, which affects the propeller characteristics when model scale open water data are used to evaluate the performance in full scale. Scale effect in itself is a widely researched topic in ship hydrodynamics, considering applications in both ship resistance and propulsion domains, but there is a scarcity of knowledge and no generally recognized scaling procedure for ducted propellers. Common experiences report a ducted propeller in full scale to be operating in a lighter loading than that it is designed for, when calculations are performed using model values. Due to a large difference of Reynolds number between the model and full scale conditions, the corresponding flow characteristics are different, and often a change of flow regime is observed between them. For a ducted propeller, these changes affect the propeller and duct forces, as well as the interaction between them, which strongly influence the integral characteristics and efficiency. Based on extensive research, many approaches have been developed for the scaling of open propeller characteristics, one of them being the ITTC method. However, due to load-dependent strong duct propeller interaction, use of a simplified scaling approach is not possible for a ducted propeller. A systematic study has been carried out in this work to calculate the scale effects of a controllable-pitch propeller working within different duct designs. CFD calculations in both model and full scales using the RANSE solver of Star-CCM+ has been the backbone of this study. Model scale open water tests and paint tests at different propeller speeds have been carried out to estimate the propeller and duct forces, as well as the streamline patterns over the propeller blade and duct. It is observed that the duct thrust and therefore also the duct induced velocities increase in the full scale, causing the propeller to operate at a higher effective advance number compared to model scale conditions. An important objective of the scale effect study is to develop a suitable scaling procedure for general use. The proposed scaling approach is derived from CFD calculations at different Reynolds numbers and loading conditions. It is a component-based procedure, where the scale effects on the pressure and friction components of the propeller and duct forces are calculated separately based on dependencies on factors like Reynolds number, thrust loading, blade pitch ratio, and duct geometry. The aim of such a scaling procedure is to obtain the full scale open water diagram from the model scale diagram, without full scale calculations for each individual case. The procedure shows promising results, but more work is needed before it can be adopted for general use...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to contribute to the optimized design of fan bypass systems in advanced turbofan engines. Increasing the engine bypass ratios have provided a major boost in engine performance improvement over the last fifty years. An engine with high bypass ratio (11 - 16 : 1) such as the Advanced <b>Ducted</b> <b>Propulsion</b> (ADP) is being developed and is expected to provide an additional 25 % improvement in overall efficiency over the early turbofans. Such significant improvements in overall efficiency would reduce the cost per seat mile, which is a major government and Industry challenge for the 21 th century. The research is part of the Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) program that involves a NASA, U. S. Industry and FAA partnership with the goal of a safe and highly productive global air transportation system. The immediate objective of the study is to perform numerical simulation of duct-strut interactions to elucidate the loss mechanisms associated with this configuration that is typical of advanced turbofan engines such as ADP. However, at present experimental data for a duct-strut configuration are not available. Thus, as a first step a wing-body junction flow would be studied and is the specific objective of the present study. At the outset it is to be recognized that while duct-strut interaction flow is similar to that of wing-body junction flows, there are some differences owing to the presence of a wall at both ends of the strut. Likewise, some differences are due to the sheared inflow (as opposed to a uniform inflow) velocity profile. It is however expected that some features of a wing-body junction flow would persist. Next, some of the salient aspects of the complex flow near a wing-body junction, as revealed by various studies reported in the literature will be reviewed. One of the principle characteristics of the juncture flow, is the presence of the mean flow components in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the oncoming free-stream flow. The lateral curvature of the wing/strat causes the oncoming turbulent layer to skew about am axis (x-axis) parallel to the plane (xz-plane) of the mean shear. This is the principle mechanism for the generation of secondary flow. Such skew-induced secondary flows are slow to be attenuated by Reynolds stresses. Additional contribution to the generation of secondary flow comes from anisotropies in Reynolds stresses. Upstream of the strut, the mean-vorticity is directed span wise (along the y-direction). The presence of secondary flow in the vicinity of the strut causes the vorticity to stretch around the obstacle in a horse-shoe shape, with each leg having a vorticity of the opposite sense. The blockage effect of the strut imposes a severe adverse pressure gradient on the oncoming turbulent shear layer, causing boundary layer separation ahead of the leading edge, resulting in a vortex that rolls up and flows downstream into the juncture region. The separation vortices trailing in the wake of the wing can alter the lift or drag characteristics of the surfaces downstream of the wing-body juncture. Likewise, on submarines, the wake flow behind the appendage can degrade the performance of the propeller located downstream. The complex nature of this flow is caused by the presence of all six components of Reynolds stresses. Devenport and Simpson report that in the vicinity of the horse-shoe vortex there is intense recirculation with turbulent stresses being much larger than those normally observed in turbulent flows. These features contribute to making this flow a challenge to predict numerically. Some of the past studies provide useful insights into this flow that would guide our numerical efforts. In measurements reported by Shabaka and Bradshaw, the eddy viscosity tensor is seen to be non-isotropic and has negative components in certain regions. In an effort to evaluate the closure assumptions of various turbulence models, Devenport and Simpson used their own extensive measurements in juncture flows around the nose of a wing-body junction. Measured values of mean-velocity and/or turbulence kinetic energy was used to predict the magnitude of the shear stress vector. Algebraic stress models performed the best followed by Cebeci-Smith eddy viscosity model. The flow is reported to be dominated by a pressure field produced by the wing and the velocity field generated by the horseshoe vortex that is wrapped around the junction between the wing and wall. Kubendran et al. conclude from an experimental study that the shape of leading edge of the wing as characterized by its slenderness ratio is a major factor in determining the flow fields in the juncture region. The more thinner the leading edge of the juncture, the weaker the horseshoe vortex is. Also, with a slender leading edge, the secondary flow in the juncture would be due mainly to the cross-stream gradients of Reynolds stresses rather than due to a lateral skewing of the shear layer...|$|R
40|$|Superior {{performance}} levels of advanced fighter aircraft require highly integrated nozzles with thrust vectoring capability. A platypus nozzle design {{with a large}} width to height ratio of its exhaust <b>duct</b> exit meets <b>propulsion</b> integration goals. The aerodynamic performance of three different geometry concepts of two-dimensional convergent/divergent nozzles with thrust vector control capability was investigated at flight Mach numbers 0. 6 and 0. 8 at sea level altitude. Under consideration of the external afterbody flowfield, Euler calculations were carried out for a nozzle with a slot exit, a nozzle with an S-shaped duct, and a nozzle configuration with injection of secondary air as coolant to reduce vectoring flap wall temperatures and for fluidic control of the gross thrust vector. As results of the CFD calculations of the nozzle/afterbody flow fields the thrust vector behavior is shown for a large range of nozzle pressure ratios, various pitch vectoring flap positions, and different mass flows of secondary air. Due to the asymmetry of the nozzle geometry, pitching moments are generated which change considerably when varying the nozzle pressure ratio from idle to maximum dry power operating conditions. The complex interaction between the external afterbody flow, the jet plume flow, and the secondary cooling air flow at subsonic Mach numbers leads to large changes of the longitudinal moment coefficients {{as a function of}} secondary air pressure ratios. Flowfield phenomena are demonstrated with isolines for Mach numbers and pressure coefficients together with pressure distributions along internal nozzle walls and external afterbody contours. (orig.)

Flow separation in internal flows such as inlets and <b>ducts</b> in aircraft <b>propulsion</b> systems and external flows such as over aircraft wings, is undesirable as it reduces the overall system performance. The aim of this research has been {{to understand the nature}} of separation and more importantly, to explore techniques to actively control this flow separation. In particular, the use of supersonic microjets as a means of controlling boundary layer separation was explored. The geometry used for the early part of this study was a simple diverging Stratford ramp, equipped with arrays of supersonic microjets. Initial results, based on the mean surface pressure distribution, surface flow visualization and Planar Laser Scattering (PLS) indicated a reverse flow region. We implemented supersonic microjets to control this separation and flow visualization results appeared to suggest that microjets have a favorable effect, at least to a certain extent. However, the details of the separated flow field were difficult to determine based on surface pressure distribution, surface flow patterns and PLS alone. It was also difficult to clearly determine the exact influence of the supersonic microjets on this flow. In the latter part of this study, the properties of this flow-field and the effect of supersonic microjets on its behavior were investigated in further detail using 2 -component (planar) Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The results clearly show that the activation of microjets eliminated flow separation and resulted in a significant increase in the momentum of the fluid near the ramp surface. Also notable is the fact that the gain in momentum due to the elimination of flow separation is at least an order of magnitude larger (two orders of magnitude larger in most cases) than the momentum injected by the microjets and is accomplished with very little mass flow through the microjets...|$|R

On 6 August 2013, Lockheed Martin said it will offer a new mission equipment package to meet the requirements for the JMR/FVL program. Lockheed will incorporate future airborne capability environment software standards into the aircraft's cockpit and mission systems to use their avionics, weapons, and sensors like the F-35 helmet. Boeing and other companies are expected to offer rival sets of avionics. On 9 September 2013, Bell announced Lockheed would be teaming with them on the V-280.|$|R
40|$|Flow {{separation}} {{in internal}} and external flows generally results in a significant degradation in aircraft performance. For internal flows, such as inlets and transmission <b>ducts</b> in aircraft <b>propulsion</b> systems, separation is undesirable as it reduces the overall system performance. The aim of this research has been {{to understand the nature}} of separation and more importantly, to explore techniques to actively control it. In this research, we extended our investigation of active separation control (under a previous NASA grant) where we explored the use of microjets for the control of boundary layer separation. The geometry used for the initial study was a simple diverging Stratford ramp, equipped with arrays of microjets. These early results clearly show that the activation of microjets eliminated flow separation. Furthermore, the velocity-field measurements, using PIV, also demonstrate that the gain in momentum due to the elimination of separation is at least an order of magnitude larger (two orders of magnitude larger in most cases) than the momentum injected by the microjets and is accomplished with very little mass flow through the microjets. Based on our initial promising results this research was continued under the present grant, using a more flexible model. This model allows for the magnitude and extent of separation as well as the microjet parameters to be independently varied. The results, using this model were even more encouraging and demonstrated that microjet control completely eliminated significant regions of flow separation over a wide range of conditions with almost negligible mass flow. Detailed studies of the flowfield and its response to microjets were further examined using 3 -component PIV and unsteady pressure measurements, among others. As the results presented this report will show, microjets were successfully used to control the separation of a much larger extent and magnitude than demonstrated in our earlier experiments. In fact, using the appropriate combination of control parameters (microjet, location, angle and pressure) separation was completely eliminated for the largest separated flowfield we could generate with the present model. Separation control also resulted in a significant reduction in the unsteady pressures in the flow where the unsteady pressure field was found to be directly responsive to the state of the flow above the surface. Hence, our study indicates that the unsteady pressure signature is a strong candidate for a flow state sensor, which can be used to estimate the location, magnitude and other properties of the separated flowfield. Once better understood and properly utilized, this behavior can be of significant practical importance for developing and implementing online control...|$|R
