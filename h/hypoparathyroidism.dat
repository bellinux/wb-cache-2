She was rushed to the St. Luke's Medical Center in Global City Taguig July 25, 2011, minutes after the State of the Nation Address by Benigno Aquino III. Doctors performed a 5-hour spine surgery on July 29, 2011 Two more surgeries occurred in August 2011 which aggravated her <b>hypoparathyroidism.</b> The House of Representatives under the leadership of Speaker Feliciano Belmonte, Jr. issued a travel permit allowing her to have treatment in Germany despite the Department of Justice hold departure order.|$|E
25|$|Molar incisor hypomineralization, {{which seems}} to be {{increasingly}} common. While the cause is unknown it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Possible contributing factors that have been investigated include systemic factors such as high levels of dioxins or polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) in the mother’s milk, premature birth and oxygen deprivation at birth, and certain disorders during the child’s first 3 years such as such as mumps, diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, <b>hypoparathyroidism,</b> malnutrition, malabsorption, hypovitaminosis D, chronic respiratory diseases, or undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease, which usually presents with mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms.|$|E
500|$|The {{state of}} {{decreased}} parathyroid activity {{is known as}} <b>hypoparathyroidism.</b> This is most commonly associated with damage to the glands or their blood supply during thyroid surgery [...] it {{may be associated with}} rarer genetic syndromes such as DiGeorge syndrome, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant syndrome. <b>Hypoparathyroidism</b> will occur after surgical removal of the parathyroid glands.|$|E

2500|$|Release {{of calcium}} from the sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} is inhibited by magnesium. Thus hypomagnesemia {{results in an}} increased intracellular calcium level. This inhibits the release of [...] parathyroid hormone, which can result in <b>hypoparathyroidism</b> and hypocalcemia. Furthermore, it makes skeletal and muscle receptors less sensitive to parathyroid hormone.|$|E
2500|$|In {{particularly}} large tumors and cancers {{with high}} white cell counts, such as lymphomas, teratomas, and some leukemias, some patients develop tumor lysis syndrome. The rapid breakdown of cancer cells causes {{the release of}} chemicals {{from the inside of}} the cells. Following this, high levels of uric acid, potassium and phosphate are found in the blood. High levels of phosphate induce secondary <b>hypoparathyroidism,</b> resulting in low levels of calcium in the blood. [...] This causes kidney damage and the high levels of potassium can cause cardiac arrhythmia. Although prophylaxis is available and is often initiated in patients with large tumors, this is a dangerous side-effect that can lead to death if left untreated.|$|E
2500|$|Advantages are {{immediate}} cure {{and potential}} removal of carcinoma. Its risks are injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, <b>hypoparathyroidism</b> (due to {{removal of the}} parathyroid glands), hematoma (which can be life-threatening if it compresses the trachea), pregnancy, young age, relapse following medical treatment, infections (less common), and scarring. The increase {{in the risk of}} nerve injury can be due to the increased vascularity of the thyroid parenchyma and the development of links between the thyroid capsule and the surrounding tissues. Reportedly, a 1% incidence exists of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis after complete thyroidectomy. Removal of the gland enables complete biopsy to be performed to have definite evidence of cancer anywhere in the thyroid. (Needle biopsies are not so accurate at predicting a benign state of the thyroid). [...] No further treatment of the thyroid is required, unless cancer is detected. [...] Radioiodine uptake study may be done after surgery, to ensure [...] all remaining (potentially cancerous) thyroid cells (i.e., near the nerves to the vocal cords) are destroyed. Besides this, the only remaining treatment will be levothyroxine, or thyroid replacement pills to be taken {{for the rest of the}} patient's life.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hypoparathyroidism</b> is {{a common}} cause of hypocalcemia. Calcium is tightly {{regulated}} by the parathyroid hormone (PTH). In response to low calcium levels, PTH induces the kidneys to reabsorb calcium, the kidneys to increase production of calcitriol (the active form of vitamin D) thereby increasing intestinal absorption of calcium, and the bones to release calcium. These actions lead to a re-balance in the blood calcium levels. However, {{in the setting of}} absent, decreased, or ineffective PTH hormone, the body loses this regulatory function, and hypocalcemia ensues. <b>Hypoparathyroidism</b> is commonly due to surgical destruction of the parathyroid glands via parathyroidectomy or neck dissection for head and neck cancers. <b>Hypoparathyroidism</b> may also be due to autoimmune destruction of the glands.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hypoparathyroidism</b> {{may present}} with {{symptoms}} associated with decreased calcium, and is generally treated with Vitamin D analogues.|$|E
50|$|Dahlberg Borer Newcomer {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autosomal X-linked recessive genetic condition characterized by a prolapse of the bicuspid valve, progressive kidney failure, congenital lymphedema, <b>hypoparathyroidism,</b> and very short end bones of fingers. Treatment for this condition is based on its symptoms. These treatments may include manual lymphatic drainage, consumption of beta blockers or anticoagulants for the bicuspid valve prolapse and vitamin D or calcium carbonate tablets for the <b>hypoparathyroidism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{are very}} few cases of <b>hypoparathyroidism.</b> Most often, it is related with {{surgical}} removal of the parathyroid glands. It can also {{be due to a}} head or neck injury and further loss of function of the glands. <b>Hypoparathyroidism</b> can also be linked to a low serum magnesium level in the blood. Serum magnesium is necessary for full secretion of PTH. [...] Without the parathyroid glands, there is no trigger to release calcium into the blood. Another consequence of <b>hypoparathyroidism</b> is the lack of calcium in the blood to trigger muscle contraction. Without calcium present, muscles innervation is unable to take place. This is especially crucial in the function of the most important muscle of the body - the heart.|$|E
50|$|Hyperparathyroidism and <b>hypoparathyroidism,</b> {{characterized}} by alterations {{in the blood}} calcium levels and bone metabolism, are states of surplus or insufficient parathyroid function.|$|E
50|$|In {{autoimmune}} polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) also autoimmunity and infections coexist: organ-specific autoimmune manifestations (e.g. <b>hypoparathyroidism</b> and adrenocortical failure) {{and chronic}} mucocutaneous candidiasis.|$|E

50|$|Hypocalcemia {{is common}} and can occur unnoticed with no {{symptoms}} or, in severe cases, can have dramatic symptoms and be life-threatening. Hypocalcemia can be parathyroid related or vitamin D related. Parathyroid related hypocalcemia includes post-surgical <b>hypoparathyroidism,</b> inherited <b>hypoparathyroidism,</b> pseudohypoparathyroidism, and pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism. Post-surgical <b>hypoparathyroidism</b> {{is the most}} common form, and can be temporary (due to suppression of tissue after removal of a malfunctioning gland) or permanent, if all parathyroid tissue has been removed. Inherited <b>hypoparathyroidism</b> is rare and is due to a mutation in the calcium sensing receptor. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is maternally inherited and is categorized by hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Finally, pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism is paternally inherited. Patients display normal parathyroid hormone action in the kidney, but exhibit altered parathyroid hormone action in the bone.Vitamin D related hypocalcemia may be associated with a lack of vitamin D in the diet, a lack of sufficient UV exposure, or disturbances in renal function. Low vitamin D in the body can lead to a lack of calcium absorption and secondary hyperparathyroidism (hypocalcemia and raised parathyroid hormone). Symptoms of hypocalcemia include numbness in fingers and toes, muscle cramps, irritability, impaired mental capacity and muscle twitching.|$|E
50|$|Hyperparathyroidism {{results in}} hypercalcaemia {{and its effects}} and in extreme bone wasting. <b>Hypoparathyroidism</b> leads to hypocalcaemia, {{evidenced}} by tetany seizure and respiratory paralysis.|$|E
