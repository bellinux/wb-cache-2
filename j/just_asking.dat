500|$|On September 11, 1970, Hendrix {{gave his}} final {{interview}} in his suite at the Cumberland Hotel in London, where he talked with Keith Altham, a journalist for Record Mirror. During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't even let that bother me. Because they {{say a lot of}} things about people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy." [...] Altham also suggested that Hendrix invented psychedelic music, to which he laughed and replied: [...] "A mad scientist approach... I don't consider [...] the invention of psychedelic, it's <b>just</b> <b>asking</b> a lot of questions." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{her first}} release with Virgin, Jackson was asked by Jam and Lewis to record a song for the sound track to the feature film Mo' Money, {{released}} in 1992 by their label Perspective Records. Jon Bream of the Star Tribune reported: [...] "For most movie soundtracks, producers negotiate with record companies, managers and lawyers for the services of big-name singers. Like the Hollywood outsiders that they are, Edina-based Jam and Lewis went directly to such stars as Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson, Luther Vandross, Bell Biv Devoe, Color Me Badd and Johnny Gill." [...] Jackson, Jackson and Vandross recorded the duet or trio [...] "The Best Things in Life Are Free", which peaked at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Hot R Singles chart. Shortly afterward, Jackson began filming for her first feature length role in John Singleton's Poetic Justice. Although she was encouraged by a major studio executive {{to take on a}} film in which she could portray a singer, she insisted on finding a different role. She explained: [...] "About that same time John Singleton asked me to read his new script. John and I became buddies—I loved Boyz N the Hood—so I thought he was <b>just</b> <b>asking</b> my advice. I was shocked and honored to learn the screenplay had been written with me in mind. 'Would you play Justice?' he wanted to know. Yes! I'd finally found a role—a dramatic nonsinging role—that was right." [...] Released in July 1993, Poetic Justice debuted at number one at the box office, grossing $11,728,455; it grossed a grand total of $27,515,786.|$|E

Lewis replied: [...] "I am so glad you like the Narnian books and it was {{nice of you to}} write and tell me. There's no use <b>just</b> <b>asking</b> me to write more.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Christian Post on April 21, 2013, Osteen expressed his sentiments on being perceived as {{being part of the}} prosperity gospel. [...] "I get grouped into the prosperity gospel and I never think it's fair, but it's just what it is. I think prosperity, and I've said it 1,000 times, it's being healthy, it's having great children, it's having peace of mind. Money is part of it; and yes, I believe God wants us to excel ... to be blessed so we can be a bigger blessing to others. I feel very rewarded. I wrote a book and sold millions of copies; and Victoria and I were able to help more people than we ever dreamed of. But when I hear the term prosperity gospel, I think people are sometimes saying, 'Well, he's <b>just</b> <b>asking</b> for money'." ...|$|E
