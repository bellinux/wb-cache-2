50|$|The {{distribution}} of neutron energies {{in a nuclear}} reactor differs from the <b>fission</b> <b>neutron</b> spectrum due to the slowing down of neutrons in elastic and inelastic collisions with fuel, coolant and construction material. Neutrons slow down in elastic and inelastic collisions, until they are absorbed via Neutron capture or lost by leakage. Neutron economy is the balanced account, in a reactor, of the neutrons created and the neutrons lost through absorption by non-fuel elements, resonance absorption by fuel, and leakage while fast and thermal energy ranges.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{isotopes}} undergo {{spontaneous fission}} with emission of neutrons. The {{most commonly used}} spontaneous fission source is the radioactive isotope californium-252. Cf-252 and all other spontaneous <b>fission</b> <b>neutron</b> sources are produced by irradiating uranium or another transuranic element in a nuclear reactor, where neutrons are absorbed in the starting material and its subsequent reaction products, transmuting the starting material into the SF isotope. Cf-252 neutron sources are typically 1/4" [...] to 1/2" [...] in diameter and 1" [...] to 2" [...] in length. When purchased new a typical Cf-252 neutron source emits between 1×107 to 1×109 neutrons per second but, with a half life of 2.6 years, this neutron output rate drops to half of this original value in 2.6 years. The price of a typical Cf-252 neutron source is from $15,000 to $20,000.|$|E

However the range of <b>neutrons</b> from <b>fission</b> follows a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution from 0 to about 14 MeV {{in the center of}} momentum frame of the disintegration, and the mode of the energy is only 0.75 MeV, meaning that fewer than half of <b>fission</b> <b>neutrons</b> qualify as [...] "fast" [...] even by the 1 MeV criterion.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fast neutron}} {{is a free}} neutron with a kinetic energy level close to [...] (...) , hence a speed of ~ (~5% {{of the speed of}} light). They are named fission energy or fast {{neutrons}} to distinguish them from lower-energy thermal neutrons, and high-energy neutrons produced in cosmic showers or accelerators. Fast neutrons are produced by nuclear processes such as nuclear <b>fission.</b> <b>Neutrons</b> produced in <b>fission,</b> as noted above, have a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of kinetic energies from 0 to ~14 MeV, a mean energy of 2 MeV (for U-235 <b>fission</b> <b>neutrons),</b> and a mode of only 0.75 MeV, which means {{that more than half of}} them do not qualify as fast (and thus have almost no chance of initiating fission in fertile materials, such as U-238 and Th-232).|$|R
40|$|An {{example is}} {{described}} of Bayesian estimation of radiation absorbed dose thresholds (subsequently simply {{referred to as}} dose thresholds) using a specific parametric model applied to a data set on mice exposed to 60 Co gamma rays and <b>fission</b> <b>neutrons.</b> A Weibull based relative risk model with a dose threshold parameter was used to analyse, as an example, lung cancer mortality and determine the posterior density for the threshold dose after single exposures to 60 Co gamma rays or <b>fission</b> <b>neutrons</b> from the JANUS reactor at Argonne National Laboratory. The data consisted of survival, censoring times and cause of death information for male B 6 CF 1 unexposed and exposed mice. The 60 Co gamma whole-body doses for the two exposed groups were 0. 86 and 1. 37 Gy. The neutron whole-body doses were 0. 19 and 0. 38 Gy. Marginal posterior densities for the dose thresholds for neutron and gamma radiation were calculated with numerical integration and found to have quite different shapes. The density of the threshold for 60 Co is unimodal with a mode at about 0. 50 Gy. The threshold density for <b>fission</b> <b>neutrons</b> declines monotonically from a maximum value at zero with increasing doses. The posterior densities for all other parameters were similar for the two radiation types...|$|R
50|$|Most nuclear {{reactors}} are hence operated in a prompt subcritical, delayed critical condition: the prompt neutrons alone {{are not sufficient}} to sustain a chain reaction, but the delayed neutrons make up the small difference required to keep the reaction going. This has effects on how reactors are controlled: when {{a small amount of}} control rod is slid into or out of the reactor core, the power level changes at first very rapidly due to prompt subcritical multiplication and then more gradually, following the exponential growth or decay curve of the delayed critical reaction. Furthermore, increases in reactor power can be performed at any desired rate simply by pulling out a sufficient length of control rod. However, without addition of a neutron poison or active neutron-absorber, decreases in fission rate are limited in speed, because even if the reactor is taken deeply subcritical to stop prompt <b>fission</b> <b>neutron</b> production, delayed neutrons are produced after ordinary beta decay of fission products already in place, and this decay-production of neutrons cannot be changed.|$|E
50|$|However, some tank armor {{material}} contains {{depleted uranium}} (DU), {{common in the}} US's M1A1 Abrams tank, which incorporates steel-encased depleted uranium armor, a substance that will fast fission when it captures a fast, fusion-generated neutron, and thus on fissioning will produce fission neutrons and fission products embedded within the armor, products which emit among other things, penetrating gamma rays. Although the neutrons emitted by the neutron bomb may not penetrate to the tank crew in lethal quantities, the fast fission of DU within the armor could still ensure a lethal environment for the crew and maintenance personnel by <b>fission</b> <b>neutron</b> and gamma ray exposure, largely depending on the exact thickness and elemental composition of the armor—information usually hard to attain. Despite this, Ducrete—which has an elemental composition similar to, but not identical to the ceramic second generation heavy metal Chobham armor of the Abrams tank—is an effective radiation shield, to both fission neutrons and gamma rays due to it being a graded Z material. Uranium, being about twice as dense as lead, is thus nearly twice as effective at shielding gamma ray radiation per unit thickness.|$|E

40|$|The initial {{results of}} a {{comparative}} study of the radiation strengthening and damage structures produced in Cu and Nb by D-T fusion and <b>fission</b> reactor <b>neutrons</b> are described. The radiation strengthening produced by a given fluence of fusion neutrons above about 10 $sup 17 $ n/cm$sup 2 $ is equal to that produced by a fluence of <b>fission</b> reactor <b>neutrons</b> (E greater than 0. 1 MeV) ten times as great. This difference is about {{twice as large as}} would be expected if the strengthening scaled with damage energy or dpa. Initial transmission electron microscopy observations of the damage structures in fusion and <b>fission</b> reactor <b>neutron</b> irradiated copper indicate that the same type of primary structural defects, vacancy and interstitial point defect clusters and small dislocation loops with a/ 3 (111) and a/ 2 (110) Burgers vectors, are produced in both cases. The difference in the radiation strengthening produced by fusion and <b>fission</b> reactor <b>neutrons</b> in Cu appears to result from a substantially greater rate of accumulation of damage, in the form of point defect clusters, during irradiation with fusion neutrons than during irradiation with <b>fission</b> reactor <b>neutrons</b> plus {{a significant difference in the}} size and spatial distributions of the damage clusters.

40|$|Measurements using 252 Cf as a timed {{source of}} {{neutrons}} and gammas have {{in recent years}} undergone significant maturation. These methods use 252 Cf as an observable source of spontaneous <b>fission</b> <b>neutrons</b> and gammas in conjunction {{with one or more}} neutron- and/or gamma-sensitive detectors to measure the time-distribution of correlated detector counts following (a) an observed 252 Cf-fission event and/or (b) a counting event i...|$|R
