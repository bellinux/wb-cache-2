50|$|The {{synthesis}} of exemestane also {{consists of three}} steps, {{as shown in figure}} 3. First off, a Vilsmeier-Haack reagent is prepared by refluxing paraformaldehyde and <b>dimethylamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> in isopentanol at a temperature of 131 °C while removing water from the isopentanol using a Dean-Stark separator. The internal temperature of the reagent is then cooled to 10-15 °C, before adding commercially available boldenone (androsta-1,4-dien-17ß-ol-3-one). The reaction mixture is then refluxed for 15 hours to give the 6-methylene derivative, 6-methyleneandrosta-1,4-dien-17ß-ol-3-one. Subsequently, Jones oxidation of the derivative in acetone at -10 °C gives exemestane in 79% yield after recrystalization. A mixture of 65:35 ethanol and water is used for the recrystalization process.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the nitrite levels in the sub-cellular fractions of cassava (Manihot esculenta crantz) leaves containing chloroplast, mitochondria and in the cytosol respectively and to their contribution in the causation of liver toxicity in rats exposed to N-nitrosamine precursors. The design of this experiment consisted of three animal groups. The first group was administered with <b>dimethylamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> plus sodium nitrite (DMA. HCL + NaNO 2), the second group was administered with sodium nitrite (NaNO 2) only and the third group (control) was given distilled water. The methods used included cell fractionation, tissue homogenization and centrifugation, spectrophotometric analysis, enzymatic determination and histopathology. Nitrite levels were estimated at 6. 08 ± 0. 92, 4. 06 ± 1. 65 and 1. 29 ± 1. 66 μg/ 200 g of cassava leaf tissue in chloroplasmic, mitochondrial and cytosolic sub-cellular fractions respectively. Both the NaNO 2 dose regime and the combined dose of DMA. HCL and NaNO 2, at P- value 0. 05, caused significant increases in GGT, ALP, AST and ALT levels in serum. The histopathological study of the rat liver for DMA. HCL + NaNO 2 administration showed severe portal and central venous congestion while the NaNO 2 administration revealed a mild periportal cellular infiltration.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the in vivo and in vitro effects of orally administered sodium nitrite (NaNO 2) and <b>dimethylamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (DMA–HCL) on liver of rats fed ad libitum with high protein diet (64 %), normal protein diet (27 %) and low protein diet (3. 5 %). Thirty Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups and kept for four weeks. Group one was given high protein diet, group two was given a normal protein diet, group three was given low protein diet, all the groups were administered with 3 mg NaNO 2 and 20 mg DMA-HCL/kg, using the application of spectrophotometric analysis, centrifugation, histolopathology, enzymatic as well as colorimetric methods. Liver function test, showed significant elevations (P < 0. 05) in the AST, ALT, ALP and GGT activities in all the groups compared with the control animals. The histopathology examination exhibited periportal necrosis. Following UV exposure after in vitro incubation of rat liver microsomal plus soluble fraction with NaNO 2 plus DMA-HCL, nitrite concentration in the rats fed high protein was highest 4. 033 and 0. 470 μg/ml, compared to the control rats which was 0. 052 and 0. 00192 μg/ml before and after UV irradiation. Nitrite loss was significant (p< 0. 05) before and after UV exposure in all the groups, indicating that the UV-light has degraded the nitrosamine precursors, thereby inhibiting possible nitrosation.

40|$|Reaction of {{cellulose}} with hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide {{has been investigated}} under various physical conditions. <b>Dimethylamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> {{was found to be}} an efficient catalyst for the system. The thermal degradation {{of cellulose}} and its phosphoramide products in air was studied by DTA, TG, and DTG techniques from ambient temperature to 500 °C.

The energies of activation, Ea, for the degradation for various cellulose phosphoramide samples were found to be in the range of 92 – 136 kJ mol− 1. These values were found to decrease with increase in the degree of substitution. A mechanism for the thermal degradation of cellulose phosphoramide has been proposed.

40|$|SUMMARY-The {{nitrosation}} of dimethylamine in buffered aqueous solutions was {{studied with}} the aid of the tritium-labeled amine. At pH 3. 4, the rate of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) Formation was proportional to the dimethylamine concentration and to the square of nitrite concen-tration. The rate of reaction was maximal at about pH 3. 4. The relative constancy of the appropriate rate constants under various conditions con-firmed the third-order kinetics of the reaction, though discrepancies were apparent at pH 1 - 2. The rate constants were used to estimate the amount of DMN expected to be Formed in the gastric contents aFter ingestion of Food containing various concentrations of dimethylamine and nitrite and during storage of such Food. For example, it was estimated that, iF a man ate a 300 -g meal containing 12 mg <b>dimethylamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and 60 mg sodium nitrite, not more than about 3 ttg DMN might be expected to be Formed intragastrically. -J Nat Cancer Inst 44 : 633 - 639, 1970.

40|$|The {{influence}} of dietary thiocyanate (SCN-) on N-nitrosation in vivo was investigated over 14 min following the administration, by stomach tube, of single doses of sodium nitrite and <b>dimethylamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> to male albino Wistar rats whose diet contained appreciable quantities of bound cyanide (cyanogenic glycosides) and free (nonglycosidic) cyanide. The rate of {{disappearance of the}} nitrosating agent (NO- 2 from the stomach in control animals showed a high linear correlation (r = - 0. 84) with gastric N-nitrosation, as measured by metabolism (N-demethylation) of ‘formed’ nitrosamine in liver tissue isolated from these animals. This statistical relationship was significantly increased (r = 0. 98), {{as well as the}} rate of NO- 2 utilization and the activity of the N-demethylase enzyme, in animals fed the test diet. Stomach SCN- content was well correlated with both stomach NO- 2 concentration (r = - 0. 95) and liver N-demethylase activity (r = + 0. 93).

40|$|Summary. -The x-ray dose {{required}} to cure half the mice bearing first generation transplanted mammary carcinomata 150 days after irradiation was determined. NDPP {{proved to be}} a relatively poor radiosensitizer in mice, for although a maximum enhancement ratio of 1 - 3 was obtained when x-rays produced from a 1. 4 MeVp electron accelerator were given between 10 and 17 min after the administration of NDPP, this was at a drug concentration sufficient to cause marked kidney abnormalities in 5 - 10 % of the mice. IT HAS BEEN suggested that radioresistant hypoxic cells may limit the success of radiotherapy in the local control of tumours (see recent review by Fowler, 1972). We are investigating drugs which will preferentially radiosensitize such cells, one such drug being NDPP (p-nitro- 3 -dimethylaminopropiophenone hydrochloride) (Ro- 03 - 6156) which has been shown in vitro to radiosensitize both bacterial and mammalian cells to give enhancement ratios (ER) of up to 4 3 and 2 - 6 respectively. The compound was synthesized from PNAP (p-nitroacetophenone) by a Mannich type condensation with formaldehyde and <b>dimethylamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (by Roche Products Limited) and, whilst retaining the same phenone moiety as PNAP, NDPP had a greatly enhanced water solubility (Adams et al., 1972). NDPP has also been shown to radiosensitize hypoxic murine skin in vivo to give enhancement ratios of 1 P 3 to 1. 5 (Denekamp and Michael, 1972). The present work is concerned with the potential of NDPP to radiosensitize hypoxic cells within tumours. It has been performed in three parts. Initially NDPP was given to oxygen breathing mice but no conclusive enhancement was obtained, and therefore it was repeated using tumours which had been made artificially totally hypoxic. A small but positive enhancement was obtained. Rapid metabolism of the drug was suspected as a possible explanation for the poor result obtained in the first experiment, and so a third experiment was performed using high dose rate x-rays, in air breathing mice, in order to give the full x-ray dose within 17 min after injection of th...|$|E
