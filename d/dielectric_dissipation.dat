40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging guided high intensity focused ultrasound {{is a potential}} non-invasive treatment which uses constructive interference patterns to concentrate ultrasound energy generated by a piezoelectric (ferroelectric) transducer to thermally ablate affected tumor and cancerous tissues. However, currently used actuators (ultrasound generators) suffer from heating of the ferroelectric materials during operation which causes the dampening of ultrasound by changing the effective thickness frequency relationship and/or depolarization of the material. The excess thermal energy also contributes to the shorter heating and longer cooling cycle of operation which in turn results in higher treatment cost because of the long operating time. Such heating is caused by an energy loss (<b>dielectric</b> <b>dissipation)</b> that takes place when an alternating electric field {{is applied to the}} ferroelectric material to generate the ultrasound waves. The loss is related to the area of the hysteresis loop of the material. The project aims at establishing a framework to reduce the <b>dielectric</b> <b>dissipation</b> in ferroelectric materials during their operation as ultrasound transducers. At the initial stage, to study the associated material characteristics, first principle approaches have been adapted as a method in our research rather than experimental methods which would consume more efforts in terms of equipment, money and time. For the purpose of this study, an all electron density functional package WIEN 2 k is being used along with the advantage of high performance computing.

By simultaneously applying a high-frequency electric field across the piezoelectric phase, the sensor response to low-frequency magnetic signals can be shifted around the "carrier" frequency as side band modulation signals. This magnetoelectric response can appear either as an electric charge via piezoelectric-to-piezoelectric (PP) modulation effects or as a magnetic signal via piezoelectric-to-magnetic (PM) modulation effects. These two signals are detected either with a charge preamplifier {{or with a}} coil surrounding the sample and the low-frequency sensor response to the applied magnetic field can be recovered by using two independent synchronous detectors. We have designed an experimental setup to observe the direct (passive) low-frequency noise and the noise corresponding to the two above modulations. Noise cross-correlating measurements were also carried out to investigate {{the origin of the}} near-carrier noise. No noise coherence was found between the direct low-frequency noise and the noise resulting from either the PP or the PM modulations. However, a noise coherence factor of more than 50 % has been found between the signals recovered from the two modulation techniques. A simple model has been used to explain this effect. The magnetoelectric sensor is considered as a nonlinear forced vibration system. Noise sources passing through such a system can be amplified and distributed around the carriers as side band noise where it hampers the equivalent magnetic noise performance. Electronic-thermal noise caused by <b>dielectric</b> <b>dissipations</b> in the piezoelectric phase can be considered as a noise source with a negligible contribution to the total noise floor.
