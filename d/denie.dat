40|$|Introduction Exploration {{tools in}} Formal Concept Analysis ([16], [4]) {{are used to}} study the {{structure}} of conceptual hierarchies. These interactive procedures acquire knowledge from an expert through an exploration dialogue. Starting with the concepts to be examined they generate new concepts by computing the largest common subconcepts and/or least common superconcepts. The hierarchy of these concepts is determined in an interactive dialogue. It provides information about dependencies between the concepts. In [13] an overview over different exploration tools in Formal Concept Analysis is given. Here we only mention the best known tool, Attribute Exploration, before turning to the description of Distributive Concept Exploration. Attribute Exploration (cf.

40|$|A spatio-temporal {{inviscid}} {{instability of}} a mixed forced-free convection boundary layer is investigated. The base flow considered is the self-similar flow with free-stream velocity ue ~ xn. Such a boundary-layer flow presents the unusual behaviour of generating a region of velocity overshoot, in which the streamwise velocity within the boundary layer exceeds the free-stream speed. A linear stability analysis has been carried out. Saddle points have been located and a critical value for the buoyancy parameter, G 0 c ≈ 3. 6896, has been determined below which the flow is convectively unstable and above which the flow becomes absolutely unstable. Two spatial modes have been obtained, one mode being convective in nature and the other absolute. The convective-type spatial mode shows mode crossing behaviour at lower frequencies. Thermal buoyancy is shown to be destabilizing to the absolutely unstable spatial mode. Eunice W Mureithi and James P <b>Denie...</b>|$|E
40|$|Dear Editor: 1 The lack of {{critical}} attention given the important evalu-ation by Marques, Day, Nelson, and West (1994) of relapse prevention {{in the treatment}} of incarcerated sexual offenders requires redressing. It appears to be the only study so far published in peer-reviewed journals which used the methodologically acceptable procedure of randomly allocating offenders to treatment or no treatment. Follow-up data were reported at an average of 3 years after discharge. The importance of the study has been recognized, Prentky (1994) referring to it as a singularly important experimental project and Marshall and Pithers (1994) as the most methodologically elegant study reported to date. However, inadequate critical attention appears to have been given the findings. Eight of the 83 child molesters who commenced treatment carried out further sexual crimes, compared to 8 of the 79 denied treatment, demon-strating no treatment effect.

40|$|Foundationalism over Strong Foundationalism. In this paper, we assess two {{arguments}} against the former {{which have been}} recently defended by Timothy McGrew. Three theses {{are central to the}} discussion: that only beliefs can be probabilifying evidence, that justification is internal, in McGrew’s sense of the term, and that only beliefs can be nonarbitrary justifying reasons. particular belief of a person is basic just in case it is epistemically justified and it owes its justification to something other than her other justified beliefs or their interrelations; a person’s belief is nonbasic just in case it is epistemically justified but not basic. Foundationalists agree that if one has a nonbasic belief, then—at rock bottom—it owes its justification to at least one basic belief. There are justified beliefs because and only because there are basic beliefs. Such is the genus Foundationalism. 1 One species is Strong Foundationalism (SF), the view that in order to be basic, a belief must enjoy certain epistemic immunities, e. g. immunity from error, refutation, or doubt.

40|$|This {{paper is}} made {{available}} {{with the permission}} of the Australian Mathematical Society Inc. 21 / 11 / 08 We consider the effect the competing mechanisms of buoyancy-driven acceleration (arising from heating a surface) and streamline curvature (due to curvature of a surface) have on the stability of boundary-layer flows. We confine our attention to vortex type instabilities (commonly referred to as Gortler vortices) which have been identified as one of the dominant mechanisms of instability in both centrifugally and buoyancy driven boundary layers. The particular model we consider consists of the boundary-layer flow over a heated (or cooled) curved rigid body. In the absence of buoyancy forcing the flow is centrifugally unstable to counter-rotating vortices aligned with the direction of the flow when the curvature is concave (in the fluid domain) and stable otherwise. Heating the rigid plate to a level sufficiently above the fluid's ambient (free-stream) temperature can also serve to render the flow unstable. We determine the level of heating required to render an otherwise centrifugally stable flow unstable and likewise, the level of body cooling that is required to render a centrifugally unstable flow stable.

We extend Reiterman's theorem to rst-order structures: {{a class of}} nite rst-order structures is a pseudovariety {{if and only if}} it is dened by a set of identities in a certain relatively free pronite structure (pseudoidentities). A well-known result of Birkho states that a class of algebras is a variety, that is, is closed under taking subalgebras, homomorphic images and direct products, if and only if it is equational, i. e. it is dened by a set of equations on the corresponding free structures. This result was then extended to rst-order structures [5, 9]: in this framework, varieties are dened by universal positive Horn sentences, i. e. by relational identities (see Section 1. 2). Birkho's original statement was generalized in another direction by Reiterman [14]. Reiterman's theorem states that a class of nite algebras is a pseudovariety (that is, it is closed under taking subalgebras, homomorphic images and nitary direct products) if and only if it is dened by a set of equations in the appropriate free pronite structures.

As a single building belongs to several owners, corporate decision is required in maintaining it. The process of arriving at a workable decision remains {{a problem in the}} maintenance of such buildings due to protracted consultation and individual differences. This paper analytically investigates the frequency of maintenance of multi storey buildings compared with single owned building within the area Lagos, Nigeria. This paper examines these processes, the challenges and possible resolution for meeting point of ideas in order to sustain the commonwealth without jeopardizing the interest of any through a field survey. Structured questionnaire and non-participant case study were adopted in collecting quantitative and qualitative data. This study adopted quantitative analysis in form of tables to evaluate the attitude of respondents towards the maintenance of external surface of buildings vis-à-vis painting in the area. Three hundred and eighty four structured questionnaires were administered in six randomly selected Local Government Areas within the study area in April-May, 2012.

40|$|Older {{adults are}} a {{heterogeneous}} group but generally {{have a higher}} peak and longer duration of action from opioids. Monitoring cumulative effects from analgesics is particularly important for older adults [1]. Older adults should be first asked to describe their hurting or pain in their own words. Pain intensity should be measured with a consistent scale, after {{making sure that the}} individual understands the scale [2]. The pain thermometer, verbal description scale, and faces pain scale have all been used successfully with older adults, but older adults tend to have difficulty accurately reporting their pain with the 100 -millimeter visual analog scale. Postoperative pain assessment during movement provides a more accurate pain measure than assessment at rest. Cognitively impaired older adults capable of verbal communication are generally able to report their pain and report pain intensity similar to cognitively intact individuals [3]. It might be necessary to try different pain scales if the older adult does not respond to the initial pain scale. Cognitively impaired older adults demonstrate more nonverbal pain behaviour on movement than those who are cognitively intact [4]. Family members can often identify behaviours indicative of pain in cognitively impaired older family members.
