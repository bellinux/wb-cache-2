Although the Indian Navy considered the AEW Sea King, {{expected to be}} designated as Mk42D, it was judged to be too expensive, consequently, in 2003, the Russian Kamov Ka-31 was procured instead. The indigenous HAL Dhruv was the intended replacement for the Sea King in the ASW role, however, in 2000, it was deemed unsuited, as the Indian Navy were dissatisfied with the design's <b>folding</b> <b>blade</b> mechanism and by the Dhruv's maintenance record.|$|E
5|$|The UK {{currently}} {{operates a}} modified version of the Apache Longbow; initially called the Westland WAH-64 Apache, it is designated the Apache AH1 by the British Army. Westland built 67 WAH-64 Apaches under license from Boeing, following a competition between the Eurocopter Tiger and the Apache for the British Army's new Attack Helicopter in 1995. Important deviations made by AgustaWestland from the U.S. Apache variants include changing to more powerful Rolls-Royce engines, and the addition of a <b>folding</b> <b>blade</b> assembly for use on naval ships.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Harper/Collins regarding his book [...] "Dead in 5 Heartbeats", Barger commented on the Sharpfinger knife: [...] "A lot of people I ride with carry that knife. I actually prefer fixed blades — like the Sharpfinger — to a <b>folded</b> <b>blade.</b> Although I carry a <b>folded</b> <b>blade</b> too, with a fixed blade you don't have to reach inside your pocket. It's always handy, on your belt when you need it. I use my Sharpfinger as a tool. I do everything with it. I like knives with sharp points. You {{never know when you}} might want to pop a balloon or peel a banana." ...|$|R

500|$|Several {{deviations}} {{were made}} to the standard Apache design used by the US and those exported to other countries. One major difference is the use of a pair of Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 01/12 engines, replacing the original General Electric T700-GE-701C engines. The Rolls-Royce engine produces [...] vs. [...] for the GE T700C engine. Compared to many helicopters used by coalition forces in Afghanistan, the Apache required less modification to serve in the region due to special filters incorporated into the design. Another change is the <b>folding</b> <b>blade</b> mechanism to stow the helicopters in confined spaces; the rotor blades also have anti-ice protection to allow operations in Arctic environments.|$|E
500|$|The AgustaWestland Apache is a licence-built {{version of}} the Boeing AH-64D Apache Longbow attack {{helicopter}} for the British Army's Army Air Corps. The first eight helicopters were built by Boeing; the remaining 59 were assembled by Westland Helicopters (now part of Leonardo) at Yeovil, Somerset in England from Boeing-supplied kits. Changes from the AH-64D include Rolls-Royce Turbomeca engines, a new electronic defensive aids suite and a <b>folding</b> <b>blade</b> mechanism allowing the British version to operate from ships. The helicopter was initially designated WAH-64 by Westland Helicopters and was later given the designation Apache AH Mk 1 (also written as [...] "Apache AH1") by the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
50|$|During World War I, the British {{manufactured}} {{a limited}} number of Webley revolvers with <b>folding</b> <b>blades,</b> similar in design to the Pritchard pistol bayonet. These were used by officers in the trenches for close quarters fighting as the confined space made it difficult to use a sword. However, few were produced due to the expense and scarcity of raw materials.|$|R
5000|$|A penknife, or pen knife, is a British English {{term for}} a small folding knife. Originally, penknives were used for {{thinning}} and pointing quills {{to prepare them for}} use as dip pens and, later, for repairing or re-pointing the nib. [...] They did not necessarily have <b>folding</b> <b>blades,</b> but resembled a scalpel or wood knife by having a short, fixed blade {{at the end of a}} long handle.|$|R
5000|$|Knife pistols with <b>folding</b> <b>blades</b> {{were popular}} in England during the mid Victorian era. These {{were made by}} Unwin and Rodgers, used black powder and were {{available}} in various small calibers. Like the modern Swiss Army knife they contained a variety of tools, from blades to corkscrews, and were often used by sailors. A modern version that fires [...]22 caliber rimfire cartridges, known as the Defender, is still in production.|$|R

50|$|Some of the {{metalwork}} {{from the}} burials is clearly linked to Scandinavia, {{and in particular}} cases, {{such as that of}} the oval brooches, is highly likely to have been made there However, other artefacts, such as some of the textiles, seax, <b>folding</b> <b>blades,</b> and spurs, are of probable Insular manufacture. Many of the objects suggest a complexity in their manufacture, with elements derived from a multiplicity of sources. However, other items, such as the buckle sets, suggest regional manufacture and provide the first evidence for either an individual craftman or workshop in the local area.|$|R
50|$|Antique penny knives have {{increased}} significantly in value and can sell {{for as much}} as $500(US). In modern production, the smallest models of the Opinel, an early 20th-century peasant's knife, continue to utilize this basic design, consisting of a <b>folding</b> <b>blade</b> pivoting on an axle mounted through a steel-bolstered wooden handle.|$|E
5000|$|Pattada {{is known}} for the {{production}} of Sardinian knives, called resolzas. There are numerous knife shops where local artisans produce these blades by hand. The resolza is a <b>folding</b> <b>blade</b> pocket knife. Other knives include fixed blade types used by shepherds. Most knives built in Pattada have handles made of ram horn.|$|E
50|$|Various {{types of}} knives with folding or {{retractable}} blades rely on latches for their function. A switchblade uses an internal spring {{to produce the}} blade which is {{held in place by}} a button-activated latch. Likewise a ballistic knife uses a strong latch to restrain a powerful spring from firing the blade as a projectile until triggered by opening the latch. A gravity knife relies on a latch to hold the <b>folding</b> <b>blade</b> in an open position once released. A balisong uses a single latch to hold the <b>folding</b> <b>blade</b> both open and closed, depending on the position of the handles; by rotating 180 degrees the same latch can be used in either configuration. Balisong latches have numerous variations, including magnetic variants and some which can be opened via a spring when the handles are squeezed together.|$|E

After testing of the prototype a commercial variant designated the KD-1A was put into production. The KD-1A had a three-bladed rotor with <b>folding</b> <b>blades</b> and a number of minor detail improvements. A KD-1B which was a KD-1A with an enclosed cockpit for the pilot was operated by Eastern Airlines and inaugurated the first scheduled rotary-wing air-mail service on 6 July 1939.|$|R
50|$|Many legends {{surround}} Japanese swords, {{the most}} frequent being that the <b>blades</b> are <b>folded</b> an immense number of times, gaining magical properties in the meantime. While <b>blades</b> <b>folded</b> hundreds, thousands, or even millions of times are encountered in fiction, {{there is no record}} of real <b>blades</b> being <b>folded</b> more than around 20 times. With each fold made by the maker, every internal layer is also folded, and so the total number of layers in a sword blade is doubled at each fold; since the thickness of a katana blade is less than 230 iron atoms, going beyond 20 folds no longer adds meaningfully to the number of layers in the <b>blade.</b> <b>Folding</b> a <b>blade</b> only ten times will therefore create 1024 layers; 20 times will create 1,048,576 layers.|$|R

This type of inexpensive folding knife was popular with small rural farmers in the United States, England, France, Italy, and Spain for much of the 19th and part of the 20th century, and consequently is often termed a farmer knife, sodbuster knife, or peasant knife.|$|E
