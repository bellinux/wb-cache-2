50|$|As {{at least}} 50% {{of the people}} exposed to <b>infected</b> <b>poultry</b> had H7 {{antibodies}} detectable with the modified assay, {{it was estimated that}} avian influenza A/H7N7 virus infection occurred in at least 1000, and perhaps as many as 2000 people.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Salmonella serovars Enteritidis and Gallinarum {{are closely}} related, but their host ranges are very different: {{the former is}} host-promiscuous and the latter can <b>infect</b> <b>poultry</b> only. Comparison of their genomic {{sequences}} reveals that Gallinarum has undergone much more extensive degradation than Enteritidis. This phenomenon has also been observed in other host restricted Salmonella serovars, such as Typhi and Paratyphi A. The serovar Gallinarum can be further split into two biovars: Gallinarum and Pullorum, which take poultry as their common host but cause distinct diseases, with the former eliciting typhoid and the latter being a dysentery agent. Genomic comparison of the two pathogens, {{with a focus on}} pseudogenes, would provide insights into the evolutionary processes that might have facilitated the formation of host-restricted Salmonella pathogens. METHODOLOGIES/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We sequenced the complete genome of Pullorum strains and made comparison with Gallinarum and other Salmonella lineages. The gene contents of Gallinarum and Pullorum were highly similar, but their pseudogene compositions differed considerably. About one fourth of pseudogenes had the same inactivation mutations in Gallinarum and Pullorum but these genes remained intact in Enteritidis, suggesting that the ancestral Gallinarum may have already been restricted to poultry. On the other hand, the remaining pseudogenes were either in the same genes but with different inactivation sites or unique to Gallinarum or Pullorum, reflecting unnecessary functions in <b>infecting</b> <b>poultry.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that the divergence between Gallinarum and Pullorum was initiated and facilitated by host restriction. Formation of pseudogenes instead of gene deletion is the major form of genomic degradation. Given the short divergence history of Gallinarum and Pullorum, the effect of host restriction on genomic degradation is huge and rapid, and such effect seems to be continuing to work. The pseudogenes may reflect the unnecessary functions for Salmonella within the poultry host...|$|R

50|$|Eimeria is a genus of apicomplexan parasites that {{includes}} various species capable of causing the disease coccidiosis in {{animals such as}} cattle, poultry, and smaller ruminants including sheep and goats. Eimeria species {{are considered to be}} monoxenous because the life cycle is completed within a single host, and stenoxenous because they tend to be host specific, although a number of exceptions have been identified. Species of this genus infect a wide variety of hosts. Thirty-one species are known to occur in bats (Chiroptera), two in turtles, and 130 named species infect fish. Two species (E. phocae and E. weddelli) infect seals. Five species infect llamas and alpacas: E. alpacae, E. ivitaensis, E. lamae, E. macusaniensis, and E. punonensis. A number of species infect rodents, including E. couesii, E. kinsellai, E. palustris, E. ojastii and E. oryzomysi.

Achievements and constraints to date and plans for the future are described. Many bird species are susceptible to infection with influenza A viruses. Aquatic birds form a major reservoir; they harbor representatives of all 16 hemagglutinin subtypes and 9 neuraminidase subtypes (1). Most of these viruses are of low pathogenicity, whether in wild or domesticated bird species, and most do not cross-infect mammals. Strains of virus that are highly pathogenic for domestic poultry (chickens and turkeys) emerge from time to time and can cause epidemics with high death rates in affected flocks; clinical signs and pathologic lesions have been described (2). These highly pathogenic strains are almost invariably of hemagglutinin types 5 or 7 (H 5 or H 7), although low-pathogenic strains of H 5 and H 7 also circulate in wild birds and can <b>infect</b> <b>poultry.</b> Outbreaks of H 5 or H 7 highly pathogenic avian influenza have occurred in recent years in different countries...|$|R

5000|$|Most human {{cases of}} the avian flu {{are a result of}} either {{handling}} dead infected birds or from contact with infected fluids. It can also be spread through contaminated surfaces and droppings. While most wild birds mainly have only a mild form of the H5N1 strain, once domesticated birds such as chickens or turkeys are infected, it can become much more deadly because the birds are often in close contact. There is currently a large threat of this in Asia with <b>infected</b> <b>poultry</b> due to low hygiene conditions and close quarters. Although it is easy for humans to contract the infection from birds, human-to-human transmission is more difficult without prolonged contact. However, public health officials are concerned that strains of avian flu may mutate to become easily transmissible between humans. Spreading of H5N1 from Asia to Europe is much more likely caused by both legal and illegal poultry trades than dispersing through wild bird migrations, being that in recent studies, there were no secondary rises in infection in Asia when wild birds migrate south again from their breeding grounds. Instead, the infection patterns followed transportation such as railroads, roads, and country borders, suggesting poultry trade as being much more likely.

40|$|Avian {{influenza}} that <b>infects</b> <b>poultry</b> {{in close}} proximity to humans is a concern because of its pandemic potential. In 2004, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H 7 N 3 occurred in poultry in British Columbia, Canada. Surveillance identified two persons with confirmed avian influenza infection. Symptoms included conjunctivitis and mild influenzalike illness. Influenza is the most diversified in birds, particularly in wild waterfowl (1). Concern exists that outbreaks of avian influenza in domestic poultry could, through a process of genetic reassortment, mutation, or both, introduce new influenza subtypes into the human population. In the context of widespread susceptibility, such an event could be the precursor of a pandemic (2, 3). An outbreak of avian influenza emerged on a farm in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia on February 6, 2004. Slightly increased deaths (8 – 16 deaths/day) were noted among 9, 200 chickens in one barn. Avian influenza infection was confirmed on February 16, 2004, and later genotypic and phenotypic intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) testing characterized the virus as low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) H 7 N 3.

Phylogenetic analysis of the subtype H 9 N 2 viruses showed that they are reassortants possessing 3 gene segments related to subtype H 7 N 3; the remaining gene segments were from the subtype H 9 N 2 G 1 clade. We detected no reassortment with subtype H 5 N 1 viruses. Serologic analyses of subtype H 9 N 2 viruses from chickens revealed antigenic conservation, whereas analyses of viruses from quail showed antigenic drift.
