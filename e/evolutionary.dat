5|$|A {{major step}} forward {{in the study of}} {{bacteria}} came in 1977 when Carl Woese recognised that archaea have a separate line of <b>evolutionary</b> descent from bacteria. This new phylogenetic taxonomy depended on the sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA, and divided prokaryotes into two <b>evolutionary</b> domains, as part of the three-domain system.|$|E
5|$|A passionate {{advocate}} of <b>evolutionary</b> theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, {{trying to communicate}} his understanding of contemporary <b>evolutionary</b> biology to a wide audience. A recurring theme in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and <b>evolutionary</b> thought. He was also an enthusiastic baseball fan and sabermetrician (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville (2003).|$|E
5|$|After Charles Darwin {{published}} Origin of Species in 1859, much of {{the focus}} of paleontology shifted to understanding <b>evolutionary</b> paths, including human evolution, and <b>evolutionary</b> theory.|$|E
5|$|Although the two poems seem separated, {{they both}} endorse an <b>evolutionary</b> {{view of the}} world. Darwin did not see a {{distinction}} between nature and culture; industrialization and technological progress {{were part of a}} single <b>evolutionary</b> process.|$|E
5|$|Creationist sources {{frequently}} define evolution {{according to}} a colloquial, rather than scientific, meaning. As a result, many attempts to rebut evolution do not address the findings of <b>evolutionary</b> biology (see straw man argument). This also means that advocates of creationism and <b>evolutionary</b> biologists often simply speak past each other.|$|E
5|$|Ecological <b>evolutionary</b> {{developmental}} biology (eco-evo-devo) integrates research from {{developmental biology}} and ecology {{to examine their}} relationship with <b>evolutionary</b> theory. Researchers study concepts and mechanisms such as developmental plasticity, epigenetic inheritance, genetic assimilation, niche construction and symbiosis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Evolutionary</b> {{biology is}} partly based on paleontology, which uses {{the fossil record}} to answer {{questions}} about the mode and tempo of evolution, and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics. In the 1980s, developmental biology re-entered <b>evolutionary</b> biology after its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of <b>evolutionary</b> developmental biology. Phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy are related fields often considered part of <b>evolutionary</b> biology.|$|E
5|$|Gould's most {{significant}} contribution to <b>evolutionary</b> biology was the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which he developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by long periods of <b>evolutionary</b> stability, which is infrequently punctuated by swift periods of branching evolution. The theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that <b>evolutionary</b> change {{is marked by a}} pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|Objections to {{evolution}} {{have been}} raised since <b>evolutionary</b> ideas came to prominence in the 19th century. When Charles Darwin published his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, his theory of evolution (the idea that species arose through descent with modification from a single common ancestor in a process driven by natural selection) initially met opposition from scientists with different theories, but eventually came to receive overwhelming acceptance in the scientific community. The observation of <b>evolutionary</b> processes occurring (as well as the modern <b>evolutionary</b> synthesis explaining that evidence) has been uncontroversial among mainstream biologists since the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{confusion}} and ambiguity in the creation–evolution debate {{is the definition of}} evolution itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of different meanings in different fields, from <b>evolutionary</b> computation to molecular evolution to sociocultural evolution to stellar and galactic evolution. When biological evolution is conflated with other <b>evolutionary</b> processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern <b>evolutionary</b> theory says anything about abiogenesis or the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Pinker also {{speaks about}} <b>evolutionary</b> {{psychology}} in the podcast {{and believes that}} this area of science {{is going to pay}} off. He cites {{the fact that there are}} many areas of study, such as beauty, religion, play, and sexuality, that were not studied 15 years ago. It is thanks to <b>evolutionary</b> psychology that these areas are being studied.|$|E
5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} (also called punctuated equilibria) is {{a theory}} in <b>evolutionary</b> biology which proposes that once species appear in the fossil record they will become stable, showing little <b>evolutionary</b> change {{for most of their}} geological history. This state is called stasis. When significant <b>evolutionary</b> change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.|$|E
5|$|River dolphin {{has been}} {{considered}} a taxonomic description, suggesting an <b>evolutionary</b> relationship among the group, although it is now known that they form two distinct clades. 'True' river dolphins are descendants of ancient <b>evolutionary</b> lineages that evolved in freshwater environments.|$|E
5|$|The Franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) {{has shown}} a {{converse}} <b>evolutionary</b> pattern, and has an ancient <b>evolutionary</b> lineage in freshwater, but inhabits estuarine and coastal waters.|$|E
5|$|The <b>evolutionary</b> {{relationship}} of insects to other animal groups remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|The {{extended}} <b>evolutionary</b> synthesis (EES) is {{an extension}} of the Modern Synthesis of evolution which revisits the relative importance of different factors at play in <b>evolutionary</b> theory. EES includes concepts and mechanisms such as multilevel selection theory, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, niche construction and evolvability.|$|E
5|$|The near-absence {{of genetic}} {{recombination}} in mitochondrial DNA {{makes it a}} useful source of information for scientists involved in population genetics and <b>evolutionary</b> biology. Because all the mitochondrial DNA is inherited as a single unit, or haplotype, the relationships between mitochondrial DNA from different individuals can be represented as a gene tree. Patterns in these gene trees {{can be used to}} infer the <b>evolutionary</b> history of populations. The classic example of this is in human <b>evolutionary</b> genetics, where the molecular clock can be used to provide a recent date for mitochondrial Eve. This is often interpreted as strong support for a recent modern human expansion out of Africa. Another human example is the sequencing of mitochondrial DNA from Neanderthal bones. The relatively large <b>evolutionary</b> distance between the mitochondrial DNA sequences of Neanderthals and living humans has been interpreted as evidence for the lack of interbreeding between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{stories have}} {{appeared}} {{in a variety of}} adaptations including a musical and animated films. <b>Evolutionary</b> biologists have noted that what Kipling did in fiction, they have done in reality, providing explanations for the <b>evolutionary</b> development of animal features.|$|E
5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific. It is argued that <b>evolutionary</b> biology does not follow the scientific method and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with {{the very nature of}} <b>evolutionary</b> theory, the scientific method, and philosophy of science.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation is the <b>evolutionary</b> {{process whereby}} an {{organism}} becomes {{better able to}} live in its habitat or habitats.|$|E
5|$|Because DNA {{collects}} mutations over time, {{which are}} then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the <b>evolutionary</b> history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in <b>evolutionary</b> biology. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This {{can be used in}} studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology; For example, DNA evidence is being used to try to identify the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>evolutionary</b> naturalism proposes an {{empirical}} account of morality, {{it does not}} require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism. C. S. Lewis argued that, if <b>evolutionary</b> naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong. Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept <b>evolutionary</b> naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part of reality, thus asserting God's existence.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in <b>evolutionary</b> developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate <b>evolutionary</b> events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{mentioned}} <b>evolutionary</b> {{interactions between}} flowering plants and insects in On the Origin of Species (1859). The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964. The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution {{can play an}} important role in driving major <b>evolutionary</b> transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences the structure and function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.|$|E
5|$|Concepts {{and models}} used in <b>evolutionary</b> biology, such as natural selection, have many applications.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{scientists}} in ethology and <b>evolutionary</b> psychology seek to explain conscience {{as a function}} of the brain that evolved to facilitate altruism within societies.|$|E
5|$|Ecology and <b>evolutionary</b> biology are {{considered}} sister disciplines {{of the life}} sciences. Natural selection, life history, development, adaptation, populations, and inheritance are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological and <b>evolutionary</b> theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto <b>evolutionary</b> trees to study {{the historical development of}} a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principals, such as phylogenetics or the Linnaean system of taxonomy. The two disciplines often appear together, such as in the title of the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution. There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization. While the boundary between ecology and evolution is not always clear, ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence <b>evolutionary</b> processes, and evolution can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Evolutionary</b> {{studies of}} {{globular}} clusters {{can also be}} used to determine changes due to the starting composition of the gas and dust that formed the cluster. That is, the <b>evolutionary</b> tracks change with changes in the abundance of heavy elements. The data obtained from studies of globular clusters are then used to study the evolution of the Milky Way as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of <b>evolutionary</b> biology, studies of mutation and genetic diversity in natural populations, combined with biogeography and systematics, led to sophisticated mathematical and causal models of evolution. Paleontology and comparative anatomy allowed more detailed reconstructions of the <b>evolutionary</b> history of life. After the rise of molecular genetics in the 1950s, the field of molecular evolution developed, based on protein sequences and immunological tests, and later incorporating RNA and DNA studies. The gene-centered view of evolution rose to prominence in the 1960s, followed by the neutral theory of molecular evolution, sparking debates over adaptationism, the unit of selection, and {{the relative importance of}} genetic drift versus natural selection as causes of evolution. In the late 20th-century, DNA sequencing led to molecular phylogenetics and the reorganization of the tree of life into the three-domain system by Carl Woese. In addition, the newly recognized factors of symbiogenesis and horizontal gene transfer introduced yet more complexity into <b>evolutionary</b> theory. Discoveries in <b>evolutionary</b> biology have made a significant impact not just within the traditional branches of biology, but also in other academic disciplines (for example: anthropology and psychology) and on society at large.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, {{molecular}} biology was increasingly {{seen as a}} threat to the traditional core of <b>evolutionary</b> biology. Established <b>evolutionary</b> biologists—particularly Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and George Gaylord Simpson, three of the architects of the modern synthesis—were extremely skeptical of molecular approaches, especially when it came to the connection (or lack thereof) to natural selection. The molecular-clock hypothesis and the neutral theory were particularly controversial, spawning the neutralist-selectionist debate over the relative importance of mutation, drift and selection, which continued into the 1980s without a clear resolution.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that our human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago. Unlike the genus Pediculus, the divergence in Phthirus does not match the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a Phthirus species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While {{it is difficult to}} determine if a parasite-host switch occurred in <b>evolutionary</b> history, this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest <b>evolutionary</b> changes).|$|E
5|$|George Ledyard Stebbins Jr. (January 6, 1906 – January 19, 2000) was an American {{botanist}} and geneticist who {{is widely}} {{regarded as one of the}} leading <b>evolutionary</b> biologists of the 20th century. Stebbins received his Ph.D. in botany from Harvard University in 1931. He went on to the University of California, Berkeley, where his work with E. B. Babcock on the genetic evolution of plant species, and his association with a group of <b>evolutionary</b> biologists known as the Bay Area Biosystematists, led him to develop a comprehensive synthesis of plant evolution incorporating genetics.|$|E
5|$|However, {{systematics}} was {{an active}} field of research long before <b>evolutionary</b> thinking was common.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to such examples, creationists specify that they are objecting only to macroevolution, not microevolution: most creationist organizations do not dispute the occurrence of short-term, relatively minor <b>evolutionary</b> changes, such as that observed even in dog breeding. Rather, they dispute the occurrence of major <b>evolutionary</b> changes {{over long periods of}} time, which by definition cannot be directly observed, only inferred from microevolutionary processes and the traces of macroevolutionary ones.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the century the ideas of {{population}} genetics began to be applied in the new discipline of the genetics of behavior, sociobiology, and, especially in humans, <b>evolutionary</b> psychology. In the 1960s W.D. Hamilton and others developed game theory approaches to explain altruism from an <b>evolutionary</b> perspective through kin selection. The possible origin of higher organisms through endosymbiosis, and contrasting approaches to molecular evolution in the gene-centered view (which held selection as the predominant cause of evolution) and the neutral theory (which made genetic drift a key factor) spawned perennial debates over the proper balance of adaptationism and contingency in <b>evolutionary</b> theory.|$|E
