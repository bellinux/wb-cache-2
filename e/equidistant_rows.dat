50|$|The burrows of Paleodictyon nodosum {{are one of}} the {{few things}} about them that {{scientists}} are actually able to study, and so this is possibly the area of which we know the most about Paleodictyon nodosum.The Top of the form is shaped like a shield, with the center raised, and a lip around the outside. The center is raised approximately 5mm above the low points. Each horizontal section consists of 3 <b>equidistant</b> <b>rows</b> of tiny holes (approximately 1mm in diameter) that connect at 120° angles. Each of these horizontal sections are connected by vertical shafts (approximately 2-3mm in diameter).When actively being inhabited, the surface of the burrow is made of red metalliferous sediment. When it becomes inactive, this becomes covered with a light gray Lutite and the top flattens out. The red sediment is only found under the surface sediment in this environment, so its presence at the surface hints at a biotic factor which brings up the sediment.The number of rows and the spacing of these rows increases in correlation with the size of the overall form. This indicates that these burrows are a result of organic growth.The raised parts of the burrow force water to flow through the burrow. As a result of this, scientists found large numbers of foraminifera tests within the burrows. These were trapped in certain areas suggesting that the burrows were engineered to catch food as prey. However the microbial counts didn't change from the inside of the burrows to the area surrounding it.The fossil record indicates that these burrows could be one of the earliest examples of complex structures being built by animals.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a two-dimensional layer of dipolar {{particles in the}} regime of strong dipole moments. Here we can describe the system using classical methods and determine the crystal structure that minimizes the total energy. The dipoles {{are assumed to be}} aligned by an external field and we consider different orientations of the dipolar moments with respect to the two-dimensional plane of motion. We observe that when the orientation angle changes away from perpendicular and towards the plane, the crystal structure will change from a hexagonal form to one that has the dipoles sitting in <b>equidistant</b> <b>rows,</b> i. e. a striped configuration. In addition to calculating the crystal unit cell, we also consider the phonon spectrum and the speed of sound. As the orientation changes away from perpendicular the phonon spectrum develops local minima that are a result of the deformation to the crystal structure.

40|$|We report new in situ {{observations}} and laboratory studies of specimens {{of a small}} (diameter 2. 4 – 7. 5 cm) strikingly hexagonal form originally described from sedimented steps in a wall of the axial valley of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (water depth 3430 – 3575 m) near 26 °N, 45 °W {{that appears to be}} identical to the iconic form Paleodictyon nodosum described as a trace fossil from Eocene flysch deposits at sites in Europe and Wales. Our findings follow: • The form is apparently agglutinated in sea floor sediment (a veneer of calcareous lutite over red metalliferous sediment) and consists of three <b>equidistant</b> <b>rows</b> of tiny holes (diameter 1 mm) that intersect at an angle of 120 ° and continuously connect through vertical shafts (length 2 – 3 mm) with an underlying horizontal network of tubes or tunnels identical with the fossil form. • The number of rows of holes and spacing of rows increase with overall diameter of the form indicative of organic growth. • The form is shaped like a shield surrounded by a lip and moat with surface relief (0. 5 cm) that is absent in the fossil form. The surface relief exposes the underlying red sediment and may have been produced either by excavation (constructional origin) or by infaunal growth (body form). • Protoplasm is absent in recovered specimens, as indicated by negative results of staining techniques, explained by either initial absence or loss. • Genetic sequencing of material from the form identified different foraminifera that had settled on the pattern of holes which acts as a baffle to trap organic matter. • Models in flume tanks show that the shield-like form deflects flow of ocean currents into a self-ventilating structure capable of aerating and of circulating organic particles through the tubes or tunnels. • Microbial counting techniques indicated background abundances within and outside the form. We come to two alternative interpretations of the findings resolvable with further studies: • The modern P. nodosum is a burrow consistent with interpretation of the ancient form as a trace fossil. • The modern P. nodosum is a compressed form of a hexactinellid sponge adapted to a sedimentary substrate, which means that the ancient form is a body fossil with possible affinity to the Ediacara fauna...|$|E

40|$|Human {{vision is}} {{extremely}} sensitive to equidistance of spatial intervals in the frontal plane. Thresholds for spatial equidistance have been extensively measured in bisecting tasks. Despite the {{vast number of}} studies, the informational basis for equidistance perception is unknown. There are three possible sources of information for spatial equidistance in pictures, namely, distances in the picture plane, in physical space, and visual space. For each source, equidistant intervals were computed for perspective photographs of walls and canals. Intervals appear equidistant if equidistance is defined in visual space. Equidistance was further investigated in paintings of perspective scenes. In appraisals of the perspective skill of painters, emphasis has been on accurate use of vanishing points. The current study investigated the skill of painters to depict <b>equidistant</b> intervals. Depicted <b>rows</b> of <b>equidistant</b> columns, tiles, tapestries, or trees were analyzed in 30 paintings and engravings. Computational analysis shows that from the middle ages until now, artists either represented equidistance in physical space or in a visual space of very limited depth. Among the painters and engravers who depict equidistance in a highly nonveridical visual space are renowned experts of linear perspective...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} an {{analytical}} model for very large arrays of wind turbines is verified against measurements. Contrary to existing engineering tools the model {{accounts for the}} wind farm’s interaction with the atmospheric boundary layer. As it is often the need for offshore wind farms, the model handles a regular array-geometry with straight rows of wind turbines and equidistant spacing between units in each <b>row</b> and <b>equidistant</b> spacing between <b>rows.</b> The case with the flow direction being parallel to rows in a rectangular geometry is considered by defining three flow regimes. In this paper {{the case of the}} direct wake with flow within ± 2. 5 ° of the direction of the rows is considered. Data used here are from the measurements presently being conducted at the Danish demonstration offshore wind farm at Horns Rev. The data encompass power from the wind turbine units and other relevant parameters, and flow characteristics measured by means of a number of meteorological masts situated {{in the vicinity of the}} wind farms. Results from the smaller offshore wind farm at Middelgrunden are used to provide a second case study. There are no meteorological measurements to provide the freestream but the power output from each turbine in the wind farm is available. The model is not in a “closed form ” and therefore experimental information is needed to determine model parameters. The geometries of the two wind farms are different, thus offering a range of flow conditions, which is useful in terms of model verification. Therefore, results from measurements will serve both model calibration and verification of the principles applied...|$|R
