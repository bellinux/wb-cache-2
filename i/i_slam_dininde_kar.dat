60|$|A dozen seconds {{would bring}} them into the tower. A single leap carried me to the heavy portal. With a resounding bang <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> it shut.|$|R
60|$|I despised the {{emphatic}} growl at my back; only, being much vexed and upset, I {{regret to}} say that <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> {{the door behind me}} in a most undignified manner.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> {{his door}} as though I dynamited his house, and went raging down the street, but I {{felt that he}} was already back at the window {{worshiping}} his blessed line in the green, before I got round the corner.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{my dreams}} {{that night he}} stalked me. I made my frozen flight from him, <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> a door on him, and he thrust his paw through a panel {{as though it had}} been paper and clawed for me. The paw got longer and longer....|$|R
6000|$|Not {{content to}} wait, {{he had to}} start {{dismantling}} her on his own. Flushing crimson, <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the book shut and leaped to my feet. But not in time to escape one last reference to those carefree bits of anatomy whose travels had originally thrown me on the track: ...|$|R
60|$|It was a silly {{thing to}} say, and I saw it arterwards, but I {{was in such}} a temper I 'ardly knew wot I was saying. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the wicket in 'is face and turned the key and then I took off my clothes and went down that ladder agin.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the rear}} {{deadhead}} car, Hermann first heard [...] "a {{little bit of}} like a metallic rattling," [...] which was by itself not an unusual sound, but it just sounded a little bit odd." [...] He recalled to investigators a day later that [...] "the next thing I know my car had kicked and I was thrown from the fourth seat or across the coach {{up to the ceiling}} ... I dropped down. I went back up again and <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> into the ceiling and then <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> down into the floor." [...] In the front, Herbert was sitting in the passenger seat behind the cab when [...] "I looked up just to do what I was doing and a split second later I'm tumbling on the floor ... I think I hit the ceiling several times. I didn't even have time to react or to think what I was doing." ...|$|R
60|$|This emboldened me, and, besides, I was now {{as angry}} as he, and {{had lost all}} fear. I ripped {{fragment}} of rock from the wall. The piece must have weighed two or three pounds. With my strength <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> it full into Red-Eye's face. It nearly finished him. He staggered backward, dropping his stick, and almost fell off the cliff.|$|R
5000|$|The New York Times wrote [...] "There {{should be}} a {{literary}} term for a book you can’t stop reading that also makes you stop to think. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> down “The Red Car,” Marcy Dermansky’s sharp and fiery new novel, in tense fits and jumpy starts, putting down the book to ponder it, but not pondering long because I had {{to know what happened}} next." ...|$|R
40|$|Sometimes, {{the first}} example one sees of a given type of wordplay becomes the ideal for all that follow. I showed a {{collection}} of palindromes to a friend who somehow had never encountered them before. In addition to ABLE WAS I ERE I SAW ELBA and RATS LIVE ON NO EVIL STAR, the collection included TEN ANIMALS <b>I</b> <b>SLAM</b> IN A NET and A MAN, A PLAN, A CANAL [...] PANAMA...|$|R
40|$|Where can {{the poem}} {{go in the}} age of the supercomputer? What do Wordsworth, Byron and British rapper Roots Manuva have in common? Would Emily Dickinson have {{preferred}} Facebook or Twitter? Does the future look… Oulipian? <b>Is</b> <b>slam</b> poetry any good, and what is “post-avant” anyway? These are just some of the questions posed in Stress Fractures, a new and wide-ranging collection of essays on the future of poetry...|$|R
6000|$|He arose {{suddenly}} to his feet. He {{was a large}} man. I was a stranger in a strange land, and John Law was looking for me. I went away hurriedly. [...] "But why ungrateful?" [...] I asked myself as <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> his gate. [...] "What in the dickens did he give me to be ungrateful about?" [...] I looked back. I could still see him through the window. He had returned to his pie.|$|R
6000|$|But I fooled {{the pair}} of them, and dosed them with their own medicine, which was faith-cure. They had faith in their funk {{that they were going}} to die. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> a lot of quinine down their throats and took their temperature. It was the first time I had used my medicine-chest thermometer, and I quickly {{discovered}} that it was worthless, that it had been produced for profit and not for service. If I had let on to my two patients that the thermometer did not work, there would have been two funerals in short order. Their temperature I swear was 105 degrees. I solemnly made one and then the other smoke the thermometer, allowed an expression of satisfaction to irradiate my countenance, and joyfully told them that their temperature was 94 degrees. Then <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> more quinine down their throats, told them that any sickness or weakness they might experience would be due to the quinine, and left them to get well. And they did get well, Wada in spite of himself. If a man can die through a misapprehension, is there any immorality in making him live through a misapprehension? ...|$|R
60|$|The thing I did, I did upon {{instinct}} {{rather than}} reason; and this again {{was not well}} done. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the door, and turned the key, placing at least that poor barrier between myself and the man I had so deeply wronged, the man whom I had given the right to slay me. A second later the door shook as if a hurricane had smitten it. He had seized the handle, and he was pulling at it frenziedly with a maniacal strength.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{it was not}} a thumb, {{any more}} than it was a snail. It was the tip of a crooked nose, crushed against the glass; it looked white with the pressure; and the staring face and eyes behind it were at first {{invisible}} and afterwards grey like a ghost. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the shutters together somehow, rushed up to my room and locked myself in. But, even as I passed, I could swear I saw a second black window with something on it that was like a snail.|$|R
60|$|I {{stepped inside}} the wicket--backwards--and then <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> {{it in their}} faces, and putting the key in my pocket, walked up the wharf. I knew it was no good {{standing}} out there argufying. I felt sorry for the pore thing in a way. If she really thought I was her 'usband, and she 'ad lost me---- I put one or two things straight and then, {{for the sake of}} distracting my mind, I 'ad a word or two with the skipper of the John Henry, who was leaning against the side of his ship, smoking.|$|R

60|$|When I had finished, George {{asked if}} the soap was in. I said I didn’t care a hang whether the soap was in or whether it wasn’t; and <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the bag to and {{strapped}} it, and found that I had packed my tobacco-pouch in it, and had to re-open it. It got shut up finally at 10.5 p.m., and then there remained the hampers to do. Harris said {{that we should be}} wanting to start in less than twelve hours’ time, and thought that he and George had better do the rest; and I agreed and sat down, and they had a go.|$|R
5000|$|... I {{was hit in}} {{the back}} by a single shot. It must have been from about 200-300 metres away. The round knocked me down in an instant, it felt like being hit by a {{sledge-hammer}} at full swing. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> into the dirt face down. (...) I was in agony, I certainly couldn't walk on my own (...) I think it was a 7.62mmround. That's a high calibre bullet to be hit by, but it shows you that the body armour works. I wouldn't be sitting here now telling you this story, if I wasn't wearing one. Thank you to whoever designed the body armour. If I ever meet them, I'd like to buy them a pint. Lance Sergeant Daniel Collins ...|$|R
5000|$|The defense {{argued that}} Mr. Peairs was {{in large part}} {{reacting}} reasonably to his wife's panic. Mrs. Peairs testified for an hour describing the incident, during which she also broke into tears several times. [...] "He was coming real fast, and it just clicked {{in my mind that}} he was going to hurt us. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the door and locked it. I took two steps into the living room, where Rod could see me and I could see him. I told him to get the gun." [...] Mr. Peairs did not hesitate or question her, but instead went to retrieve a handgun with a laser sight that was stored in a suitcase in the bedroom, which he said [...] "was the easiest, most accessible gun to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Presently {{he came up}} again, still muttering. He {{opened the}} door of the room, and before <b>I</b> could enter, <b>slammed</b> it in my face.|$|R
5000|$|... "There was a {{free speech}} fight on, but of it I knew nothing. Suddenly a policeman’s hand shook my shoulder, and when, insulted, I resisted, <b>I</b> was <b>slammed</b> in the jaw; {{completely}} subdued, I was brought before the police sergeant, absolutely in the dark {{as to what was}} the cause.'Here’s another Red, Sergeant.'" ...|$|R
2500|$|The album {{began taking}} shape {{towards the end}} of the hiatus. Burnley stated that after growing {{frustrated}} with the lack of answers concerning his health condition, he decided to focus on writing music, saying on That Metal Show, [...] "I literally took my medical records [...] and <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> them down like, 'You know what, forget this, I'm not getting anywhere with this', so I just decided to stop trying to find out whatever it was and just focus on our music, and that's when Dark Before Dawn really started to take shape." [...] After the album was mostly written, Burnley began assembling new members of the band, including Jasen Rauch (lead guitar; originally from Red), Keith Wallen (rhythm guitar and backing vocals; originally from Adelitas Way), Aaron Bruch (bass), and Shaun Foist (drums; originally from Picture Me Broken).|$|R
60|$|That {{return to}} my inn sticks in my memory also as a thing apart, as an {{experience}} apart. Within was a subdued bustle of women, a flitting of lights, and the doing of petty offices to that queer, exhausted thing {{that had once been}} my active and urgent little uncle. For me those offices were irksome and impertinent. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the door, and went out into the warm, foggy drizzle of the village street lit by blurred specks of light in great voids of darkness, and never a soul abroad. That warm veil of fog produced an effect of vast seclusion. The very houses by the roadside peered through it as if from another world. The stillness of the night was marked by an occasional remote baying of dogs; all these people kept dogs because of the near neighbourhood of the frontier.|$|R

60|$|I {{opened the}} front door and they passed out. The {{automobile}} was still purring on the drive. Buck's pistol had disappeared. I supposed the chauffeur had picked it up, a surmise which was proved correct a few moments later, when, just as the car was moving off, there was a sharp crack and a bullet struck the wall {{to the right of the}} door. It was a random shot, and I did not return it. Its effect on me was to send me into the hall with a leap that was almost a back-somersault. Somehow, though I was keyed up for violence and the shooting of pistols, I had not expected it at just that moment, and I was disagreeably surprised at the shock it had given me. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the door and bolted it. I was intensely irritated to find that my fingers were trembling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Too late now, anyway," [...] Mrs. Lawrence declared. [...] "She's {{gone for}} good, and no mistake. Walked {{right out of}} the house. <b>I</b> heard her <b>slam</b> the front door." ...|$|R
50|$|The My Charmer is {{the first}} of four $100,000 stakes on Calder’s Grand <b>Slam</b> <b>I</b> card, along with the Three Ring Stakes, the Foolish Pleasure Stakes, and Grade 3 Tropical Turf Handicap.|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{localization}} and mapping (SLAM) {{consists in}} the concurrent {{construction of a}} model of the environment (the map), and the estimation {{of the state of the}} robot moving within it. The SLAM community has made astonishing progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey the current state of SLAM and consider future directions. We start by presenting what is now the de-facto standard formulation for SLAM. We then review related work, covering a broad set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees, active SLAM and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of SLAM. By looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific investigation. The paper also contains the authors' take on two questions that often animate discussions during robotics conferences: Do robots need <b>SLAM?</b> and <b>Is</b> <b>SLAM</b> solved...|$|R
5000|$|Representative Barney Frank (Democrat, Massachusetts), Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said paying these bonuses {{would be}} [...] "rewarding incompetence" [...] and [...] "These {{people may have}} a right to their bonuses. They don't {{have a right to}} their jobs forever." [...] Representative Mark Kirk (Republican, Illinois) said [...] "AIG should not be on welfare from Uncle Sam, and yet paying bonuses and {{transferring}} a considerable amount of taxpayer funds to entities overseas." [...] Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said [...] "It makes me angry. <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the phone more than a few times on discussing AIG." [...] Lawrence Summers, Director of the National Economic Council, said [...] "The easy thing would be to just say, you know, ‘Off with their heads,’ and violate the contracts." [...] Austan Goolsbee, of the Council of Economic Advisers said [...] "I don't know why they would follow a policy that's really not sensible, is obviously going to ignite the ire of millions of people." [...] and [...] "You worry about that backlash." ...|$|R
50|$|The Tropical Turf is {{the last}} of the four $100,000 stakes races on Gulfstream West's “Grand <b>Slam</b> <b>I</b> program.” The My Charmer Handicap is the first, the Three Ring Stakes second, and the Foolish Pleasure Stakes third.|$|R
60|$|Somewhere {{within the}} house a door <b>slammed.</b> <b>I</b> got away from her feeling small and weak as if {{the best part of}} me had been torn away and irretrievably lost. Rose must have been somewhere near the door.|$|R
5000|$|... "There {{was already}} a Julie Smith, a Julie Anne Smith, there was everything. My father's middle name is Moore; my mother's name is Anne. So <b>I</b> just <b>slammed</b> the Anne onto the Julie. That way, I could use both of their names and not hurt anyone's feelings. But it's horrible to change your name. I'd been Julie Smith my whole life, and I didn't want to change it." [...] —Moore {{explaining}} why and how she adopted her stage name ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was still}} {{standing}} with my hand upon the latch, gazing after my unexpected visitor, when I became aware of yet another dweller in the wilderness. Some distance along the path which the stranger was taking there lay a great grey boulder, and leaning against this was a small, wizened man, who stood erect as the other approached, and advanced to meet him. The two talked {{for a minute or}} more, the taller man nodding his head frequently in my direction, as though describing what had passed between us. Then they walked on together, and disappeared in a dip of the fell. Presently I saw them ascending once more some rising ground farther on. My acquaintance had thrown his arm round his elderly friend, either from affection or from a desire to aid him up the steep incline. The square burly figure and its shrivelled, meagre companion stood out against the sky-line, and turning their faces, they looked back at me. At the sight, <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the door, lest they should be encouraged to return. But when I peeped from the window some minutes afterward, I perceived that they were gone.|$|R
60|$|Once, indeed, I was betrayed into a childishness {{greater than}} her own; it fell in this way. On my return from classes, {{thinking}} upon her devoutly {{with a great}} deal of love and a good deal of annoyance in the bargain, the annoyance began to fade away out of my mind; and spying in a window one of those forced flowers, of which the Hollanders are so skilled in the artifice, I gave way to an impulse and bought it for Catriona. I do not know the name of that flower, but it was of the pink colour, and I thought she would admire the same, and carried it home to her with a wonderful soft heart. I had left her in my clothes, and when I returned to find her all changed and a face to match, I cast but the one look at her from head to foot, ground my teeth together, flung the window open, and my flower into the court, and then (between rage and prudence) myself out of that room again, of which <b>I</b> <b>slammed</b> the door as I went out.|$|R
