He then decided {{to pursue a career}} in film-making; he attended two courses in basic film-making at State University of New York. He stated, [...] "I always knew I wanted to be in films but I did not know exactly what I wanted to do. I loved movies and watched a lot of them. But my father <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> get a good education before I joined the film industry".|$|E
2500|$|I will {{be forever}} indebted to Dan [...] for his {{companionship}} and inspiration. Indebted, too, {{because it was}} Dan who insisted on giving my name to the Wulff Series and gave me stature I might never have had otherwise. We were fishing together on the Esopus {{in the spring of}} 1930 when I was trying out some new flies I'd designed in revolt to the then available Catskill patterns. The new flies had bucktail wings and tails for better floatation. I had planned to call one of them the Bucktail Coachman. It was Dan who <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> call them Wulffs and he started tying them under that name— Lee Wulff in the tribute in Mist on the River-Remembrances of Dan Bailey.|$|E
2500|$|The Byrds' drummer, Gene Parsons (no {{relation}} to Gram), contributed two songs to the album: [...] "Get Down Your Line", {{a reflection on}} the need for self-improvement, and [...] "B.B. Class Road", a lighthearted song about a road manager's life on tour with a rock band, co-written by The Byrds' roadie, Stuart [...] "Dinky" [...] Dawson. [...] For many years it was assumed that the lead vocal on [...] "B.B. Class Road" [...] was sung by Dawson himself, but Parsons eventually revealed in the early 1990s that it was actually him singing on the track. [...] Parsons went on to elucidate by stating [...] "I wanted Dinky to sing this song but Dinky <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do it. Until now, everyone thought he did. I tried to sing it with an excess of testosterone in the true spirit of rock 'n roll." [...] Parsons further explained to The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan in 1997 [...] "I was imitating and taking on a different persona. Stuart and I collaborated and it's me growling and howling out the vocal." ...|$|E

60|$|And still, for all <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> must <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am {{a single}} human being, an individual, not a mere {{national}} unit, a mere chip of l'Inghilterra or la Germania. I {{am not a}} chip of any nasty old block. I am myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; haven't you heard? Miss Bell {{has been}} here this morning, <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should have over Lord De Guest and his sister for the marriage. It seems {{that there was some}} scheming between Bell and Lady Julia." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 24, Strahorn sought {{adventure}} and fame in the Great Sioux War of 1876 as a war correspondent for the New York Times, Chicago Tribune and the Rocky Mountain News. Strahorn was embedded with General George Crook’s Big Horn and Yellowstone Expedition {{for over a year}} and reported the people and events of the Great Sioux War to the public. [...] “I <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going in to fight. It was my business as a correspondent to get the news, and I couldn’t think of getting it from the rear.” At the time, war correspondents rode into battle with the troops. [...] General Cook said, “Strahorn worked as well with his rifle as with his pen.” [...] Strahorn was commended by Secretary of War for distinguished bravery and gallantry in action against hostile Indians during the Great Sioux War. Strahorn fought and reported the Horsemeat March, Battle of Powder River, Battle of the Rosebud, Battle of Slim Buttes, Dull Knife Fight and Battle of Wolf Mountain. [...] Strahorn also reported the Battle of the Little Big Horn and witnessed the surrender of Crazy Horse at Fort Robinson on May 6, 1877.|$|E
60|$|Minver's point {{provoked}} both Wanhope {{and myself}} {{to begin a}} remark at the same time. We begged each other's pardon, and Wanhope <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should go on.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not come}} in to fool," [...] he said, stoutly. [...] "Your man outside <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should come in and try on the things, {{although}} I told him I {{did not wish to}} buy." ...|$|E
60|$|I cannot sleep, so I {{make this}} entry. But I {{must try to}} get a few hours' sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> go with him on another expedition.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, royal madam," [...] said Edith, [...] "this, surely, is {{dwelling}} on a jest which has rather been worn out, I laid no wager, however {{it was your}} Majesty's pleasure to suppose, or to <b>insist,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have picked}} up {{very much in the}} last fortnight, count; and I hope, in another month, to be {{something}} like myself again; though the doctor <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall not be fit for campaigning work for double that time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you know}} what my {{instructions}} are. I am sorry to intrude, but you heard how earnestly Holmes <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should not leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{continued}} Archie, [...] "father <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was to take}} them, {{though they}} quite spoiled the view. So I did; but in the very middle of the operation, what did the captain do but insist on changing his--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When you <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a king, yes," [...] he replied. [...] "But now I {{begin to}} believe that it must be I who am mad, after all, or else I bear a {{remarkable}} resemblance to Leopold of Lutha." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{is the end}} of {{the adventures}} of Buster Bear in this book because--guess why. Because Old Mr. Toad <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must write a book about his adventures, and Old Mr. Toad is such a good friend of all of us <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am going to do it.|$|R
5000|$|In an interview, Anum said, [...] "MD Production - Fahim Burney’s {{production}} {{house has}} been <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> act {{for them in the}} past year. But I had different priorities at the time. I was completing my studies and waiting for the right time to make my debut. Of course, working with Gohar felt like the most natural and comfortable way to begin".|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can beat}} me now, Wilson, but I could squeeze till I made you howl once, and mayhap I'll do it again--who knows? But {{you must not}} think me unkind if I ask you to leave me, Wilson. The Doctor is always <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must keep quiet; so, good-day to you, my boy, an' {{remember}} me kindly to my comrades." ...|$|R
60|$|Then she <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{should tell}} her all I had been doing, {{and by the}} time that long story was come to an end I had need to join Darius on the shore, having stayed the full length of the {{furlough}} he gave us.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} Jernyngham {{believed}} of me. I could not marry you {{with such a}} stain on my name; {{but it will be}} wiped off in a few more days, and this I owe to you. It was you who <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should clear myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Sir George," [...] he said, [...] "I {{trust that}} you will {{appreciate}} my position in this matter. I do not even know the young lady's name. My eccentric friend in his telegram, which occupied four forms, most specially <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should ask or answer no questions concerning her." ...|$|E
60|$|Of the doings of Peter and Mrs. Peter Rabbit {{and their}} four {{children}} {{there are many more}} stories, so many that one book will not hold all of them. Besides, Bowser the Hound <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must write a book about him, and I have promised to do it right away. So the next book will be Bowser the Hound.|$|R
50|$|And on 17 September 1789, he noted:She is {{a convert}} to my principles. We have a gay {{conversation}} of some minutes on their affairs, in which I mingle sound maxims of government with that piquant légèreté which this nation delights in. I am fortunate, and at going away she follows me and <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> dine with her next time I come to Versailles.|$|R
6000|$|And then {{he becomes}} {{increasingly}} unfair to me. Unfair, indeed, {{to an extent}} I should not have expected in a man trained {{in the search for}} truth. Looking back over my previously written account of these things, <b>I</b> must <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have been altogether juster to Cavor than he has been to me. I have extenuated little and suppressed nothing. But his account is:-- ...|$|R
60|$|At last I {{signed to}} Ajor to lie down, for I {{knew that she}} must have sleep, and I sat on guard until nearly morning, when the girl awoke and <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> take some rest; nor would she be denied, but dragged me down as she laughingly menaced me with her knife.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{impossible}} to convince Oppenheimer of my sincerity. He <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was making it up as I went along, although he applauded what he called my [...] "to-be-continued-in-our-next," [...] and, at the times they were resting me up from the jacket, was continually begging and urging me to run off a few more chapters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] {{replied the}} other. [...] "If {{it had not}} been for you I should now be in New York, with no thought of present {{proposals}} of marriage. But you came to me, and <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should see the lady." [...] "That was simply because she had expressed a strong desire to see you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{condemnation}} {{for having}} referred to Adolf Hitler {{as being a}} 'great man', Farrakhan has said, [...] "I have throughout my life referred to Hitler as a wicked man, yet, the national news media <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> called him a 'great man', with the implied inference that 'great' means 'good'. However, I did refer to him as 'wickedly great', {{in the same sense}} that Genghis Khan stands out in history." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forbid Mark {{to execute}} a plot with which he threatens me. He says he will bring every gentleman he knows (and {{that is a great}} many) to the house, and make it so {{agreeable}} that they will keep coming; for he <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> need amusement, and nothing will be so entertaining as a lover or two. Please tell him not to, for I don't want any lovers yet." ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{perhaps my}} story ought to stop; for I was happy at last, {{and have never}} since, thank Heaven! known want: but Gus <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should add how I gave up the place in the Tape and Sealing-wax Office, and for what reason. That {{excellent}} Lady Jane Preston is long gone, and so is Mr. P--- off in an apoplexy, {{and there is no}} harm now in telling the story.|$|R
6000|$|... "Adelheid {{was very}} {{grateful}} for what I had done, and as she had now learned to place full reliance upon me, she <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should be the bearer of a letter from her to the Emperor Otto.

6000|$|... "Sir Wycherly has <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall {{consider}} his table as set {{in my own}} cabin," [...] he continued; [...] "and I know of no better manner of proving my gratitude, than by taking him at his word, and filling it with guests that will be agreeable to us both.

6000|$|They {{had heard}} of me. In the few days in which I {{had been with the}} Larramies, Miss Willoughby had written of me. They <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should stay to supper, for what good reason could there be for my taking that meal at the hotel--not a very good one--when they would be so glad to have me sup with them and talk about our mutual friends? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{know the}} ordeal I must face when I {{make such a}} statement. I see clearly before me the solid phalanx of men from Missouri, some urging me to tell it to the King of Denmark, others <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> produce my Eskimos. Nevertheless, I do not shrink. I state once more that in his thirty-first year Archibald Mealing went in for a golf championship, and won it.|$|R
60|$|Sergeant Corney flatly {{refused to}} tell the story, <b>insisting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was the better able to do so, and, in the {{presence}} of Colonel Gansevoort and all his principal officers, I related the events of that day when an able soldier and a brave man was forced by the prating of cowards to lead his soldiers where he knew, almost beyond a peradventure, he had no hope of winning a victory.|$|R
5000|$|... "Yan: Let {{me make a}} {{statement}} here: I have checked up on all those quotes. I said none of them, they are pure fabrication. I {{have been critical of}} the Literary inquisition and never expressed any opinion on Han costume. If someone <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> said such things, please point out in which book and on which page, or in which of my talks. The imprecision of the quotes is not scholarly at all.|$|R
