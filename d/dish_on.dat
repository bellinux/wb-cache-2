25|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} in S. aureus was uncommon when penicillin {{was first introduced}} in 1943. Indeed, the original Petri <b>dish</b> <b>on</b> which Alexander Fleming of Imperial College London observed the antibacterial activity of the Penicillium fungus was growing a culture of S. aureus. By 1950, 40% of hospital S. aureus isolates were penicillin-resistant; by 1960, this had risen to 80%.|$|E

25|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{is comparable}} {{in size and}} general shape to a grand piano and {{has been compared to}} a piano glued to a cocktail bar-sized satellite dish. As a point of departure, the team took inspiration from the Ulysses spacecraft, which also carried a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) and <b>dish</b> <b>on</b> a box-in-box structure through the outer Solar System. Many subsystems and components have flight heritage from APL's CONTOUR spacecraft, which in turn had heritage from APL's TIMED spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|Attitude control (3-axis stabilization) is {{achieved}} using two 3-axis inertial measurement units, {{a set of}} two star cameras and two Sun sensors, gyroscopes, accelerometers, and four 12 N·m·s reaction wheels. Pointing accuracy is 0.04 degree {{with respect to the}} inertial reference frame and 0.8 degree with respect to the Mars orbital frame. Three on-board systems help Mars Express maintain a very precise pointing accuracy, which is essential to allow the spacecraft to communicate with a 35-metre and 70-metre <b>dish</b> <b>on</b> Earth up to 400 million kilometres away.|$|E
25|$|The eighty gigabits {{per second}} of {{bandwidth}} each Ka band satellites offers is an improvement on the four to six {{gigabits per second}} capacity available from earlier interim satellites. The satellites bounce signals from a satellite <b>dish</b> <b>on</b> the premises to an earth station, known as a 'gateway'; the gateway is then connected to a POI via a fibre backhaul. The satellite design was 'not easy', because the required coverage is about 'five per cent of the world's land mass' containing 'at least 200,000 premises' spread across 'over 7,000 kilometres' of area between Cocos Islands and Norfolk Island.|$|E

25|$|Koryo-saram have {{preserved}} the Korean cuisine particularly well. The cuisine of the Koryo-saram {{is closest to}} that of the Hamgyong provinces in North Korea, and is dominated by meat soups and salty side dishes. It uses similar cooking techniques but is adapted to local ingredients, which resulted in invention of new dishes. One well-known example is spicy carrot salad, known throughout the Soviet Union as Korean-style carrot. It is a Koryo-saram invention and was unknown in South Korea until recently. However, it has gained an international following, being served in most cafeterias throughout the CIS, sold in all supermarkets, and featured regularly as a side <b>dish</b> <b>on</b> dinner tables and in holiday feasts set by all ethnicities of the former Soviet Union. On the other hand, some South Korean dishes such as bulgogi, bibimbap, and samgyeopsal were relatively unknown to Koryo-saram until recently. Dishes traditionally popular among Koryo-saram include pigodi, kuksu (Korean:국수), timpeni, khe, chartagi, kadi che (Korean:가지채), kosari che (Korean:고사리채), chirgym che, panchan, schirak tyamuri, kadyuri.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Alice {{characterized}} the atmosphere, both by emissions of atmospheric molecules (airglow), and by dimming of background stars {{as they pass}} behind Pluto (occultation). During and after closest approach, SWAP and PEPSSI sampled the high atmosphere {{and its effects on}} the solar wind. VBSDC searched for dust, inferring meteoroid collision rates and any invisible rings. REX performed active and passive radio science. The communications <b>dish</b> <b>on</b> Earth measured the disappearance and reappearance of the radio occultation signal as the probe flew by behind Pluto. The results resolved Pluto's diameter (by their timing) and atmospheric density and composition (by their weakening and strengthening pattern). (Alice can perform similar occultations, using sunlight instead of radio beacons.) Previous missions had the spacecraft transmit through the atmosphere, to Earth ("downlink"). Pluto's mass and mass distribution were evaluated by the gravitational tug on the spacecraft. As the spacecraft speeds up and slows down, the radio signal exhibited a Doppler shift. The Doppler shift was measured by comparison with the ultrastable oscillator in the communications electronics.|$|E

500|$|When the Progenator completes, five {{brand new}} Daleks in larger, {{redesigned}} casings {{emerge from the}} Progenator Chamber (The Scientist, the Drone, the Strategist, the Eternal and the Supreme). They disintegrate the older [...] "inferior" [...] models, who die willingly. At the same time, Amy convinces Churchill and Bracewell to use the technological know-how they have obtained from the Daleks to modify three Spitfires {{so that they can}} fly in space. The pilots attack and destroy the <b>dish</b> <b>on</b> the underside of the Dalek ship that was firing the energy beam, saving London before it can be destroyed by the approaching German bombers.|$|E

This system meant {{that instead of}} one person preparing a <b>dish</b> <b>on</b> one's own, now multiple cooks would prepare the different components for the dish. An example used is [...] "oeufs au plat Meyerbeer", the prior system would take up to fifteen minutes to prepare the dish, while in the new system, the eggs would be prepared by the entremettier, kidney grilled by the rôtisseur, truffle sauce made by the saucier and thus the dish could be prepared in a shorter time and served quickly in the popular restaurants.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{variously}} {{described his}} writing as [...] "forthright," [...] "chatty", and [...] "charming". In a review in The Globe and Mail Brian Brett admires [...] "Suzuki's disarming candour" [...] and labels it [...] "a strange, fascinating book". While Brett's review is positive, {{he calls it}} [...] "clunkily written" [...] and sometimes repetitive. The Edmonton Journal review notes that Suzuki could [...] "charm the socks off the most hardened soul", but {{that many of his}} stories fall flat. The review in the Quill & Quire notes Suzuki [...] "has not written an indulgent autobiography" [...] and that he [...] "is too polite to <b>dish</b> <b>on</b> his enemies". Writing for The Vancouver Sun, Robert Wiersema states that while [...] "his life is an open book... ou get the sense of meeting the real Suzuki for the first time." [...] Wiersema calls him [...] "a natural storyteller". The New Zealand Listener review states, [...] "as a writer, he has the charm of a high-school geek desperately trying to get a date... but ultimately it's what allows his story to convince". Several critics find Suzuki's writing on death to be particularly well-done.|$|E

500|$|Joseph P. Kennedy {{had been}} a patron of Le Pavillon, but after Decré and Meyzen opened their new restaurant, Kennedy {{switched}} his patronage to La Caravelle, dining there regularly when in New York. [...] It became a popular place for the Kennedy family to visit. Fessaguet chose and trained René Verdon to be chef at the White House when John F. Kennedy was elected president the year after opening. Verdon spent some weeks working with Fessaquet on the Kennedy family's favorite dishes. President Kennedy was especially fond of La Caravelles vichyssoise and chicken in champagne sauce. [...] He often requested them as [...] "take out" [...] orders and would have them heated up on the plane as he traveled.

However, when they arrive, they are disappointed {{to find out that}} it is a Christian event, and the actual name of the convention is [...] "† Games". The car engine dies on the way back and they are forced to stop in the neighborhood of Little Ethiopia, where the three go into a restaurant serving Ethiopian food. Although initially averse to the exotic food, Marge is reminded that she wants to be a fun mom and therefore asks for the most authentic <b>dish</b> <b>on</b> the menu for her and her children. All three of them enjoy the food. At the restaurant, Marge, Bart, and Lisa bump into a group of foodies, who encourage them to start their own food blog, [...] "The Three Mouthketeers". The blog quickly becomes popular and the three spend much time together trying out new food and writing about it. This leaves Homer feeling left out and sad.|$|E
500|$|In 52 #7, Kate Kane is {{introduced}} (although she {{is referred to}} as Kathy on several occasions). No Origins titles have been presented for Kate Kane; her fictional backstory is presented in Detective Comics through the use of exposition and flashbacks. In their early childhood, Katherine Rebecca [...] "Kate" [...] Kane and her sister Elizabeth [...] "Beth" [...] Kane were identical twins and were very close to each other. On their twelfth birthday their military father could not come home so Kate and Beth were taken by their mother, Gabrielle [...] "Gabi" [...] Kane, to an expensive restaurant for chocolate and waffles, their favorite <b>dish.</b> <b>On</b> the way to the restaurant, a group of gunmen attacked the family and took them hostage, killing their bodyguard in the process. After learning of her family's kidnapping, Kate's father Colonel Jacob [...] "Jake" [...] Kane led a rescue mission to save his captured family, which ended with Kate's mother executed and Beth apparently killed after being caught in the crossfire between the kidnappers and soldiers. Years later, Jake marries Catherine Hamilton Kane. Kate is attending the United States Military Academy, West Point, where she receives excellent grades and ranks {{at the top of her}} class. However, when it is alleged that she is in a lesbian relationship with another student, Kate's commanding officer asks her to disavow the allegation. Telling the officer that she refuses to lie and violate the code of the Academy, Kate admits to being lesbian and is forced to leave the school. When she confronts her father with the news, he supports her and affirms that she upheld her honour and integrity. She then moves back to Gotham City where she attends college and pursues a wild social lifestyle, consisting of parties and tattoos. Kate is eventually pulled over for speeding by a young Renee Montoya, who was just a traffic cop at this point. The two date for several months and break up following a fight where Kate berates Renee for keeping her sexuality hidden from her colleagues and family; after Renee expresses concern about Kate's lack of direction, when it's revealed she's not been attending college. While attempting to call Renee and apologize for her behavior, Kate is attacked by a mugger who wants her wallet and cell phone. Using her military training, Kate easily defeats the criminal just as Batman arrives and helps her off the ground. She is then shown fixated by the Bat Signal as Batman departs the scene.|$|E
