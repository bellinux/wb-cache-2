25|$|Ocularists and eye {{surgeons}} {{have always}} {{worked together to}} make artificial <b>eyes</b> <b>look</b> more realistic. For decades, all efforts and investments to improve the appearance of artificial eyes have been dampened by the immobility of the pupil. One {{solution to this problem}} has been demonstrated recently in a device based on an LCD which simulates the pupil size {{as a function of the}} ambient light.|$|E
500|$|Following {{his success}} with the film Titanic, {{director}} James Cameron teamed up with Charles H. Eglee. The two formed a production company, Cameron/Eglee Productions, and began working on ideas for a television series, eventually deciding {{on the idea of}} Dark Angel. Cameron said they began with the idea that Max would be a genetic construct who appeared normal but was different on a genetic level, saying [...] "We explored what that could mean. Do her <b>eyes</b> <b>look</b> different? Were there things that manifest themselves? Were there negatives to it? We wanted her to have flaws, things that were built inlike Kryptonite." [...] Max followed a long line of strong female characters in films directed Cameron, including Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley. Cameron believes such characters are well received all round as women respond favourably to strong female characters and male audiences [...] "want to see girls kick ass".|$|E
500|$|... is {{a former}} ninja of Iwagakure, having {{previously}} left the village after bombing it. He was a terrorist bomber-for-hire before Itachi Uchiha forced him to join Akatsuki. Though he came to embrace the organization, Deidara still holds a grudge against Itachi and all other Uchihas throughout the series, as he feels their Sharingan <b>eyes</b> <b>look</b> down on his artwork. Upon joining the Akatsuki, he is partnered with Sasori, who is subsequently replaced by Tobi after his death. Though he abuses Tobi when he annoys him, Deidara becomes more like a teacher to him, and adopts a genuine care for his well-being. Both of Deidara's hands have mouths on them that, by infusing clay or other fine-grained minerals with chakra, create [...] "sculptures", bombs that explode with varying intensities. Deidara's bombs can take any form he chooses, and {{from the time of}} their creation to their detonation, he can animate and control them remotely. Sasuke Uchiha, Itachi's younger brother, is able to systematically nullify his bombs in combat, and so Deidara transforms himself into a living bomb in a last effort to kill Sasuke and to prove the supremacy of his art, but fails in the attempt. He is later resurrected by Kabuto for the war against the Shinobi Alliance but is defeated by Kankuro. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Katsuhiko Kawamoto. In his cameo appearance in episode 135 of the English adaptation, he is voiced by Quinton Flynn, and in the anime of Shippuden by Roger Craig Smith.|$|E

40|$|An {{electromyography}} (EMG) -based {{human-machine interface}} (HMI) is a communication pathway between a human and {{a machine that}} operates {{by means of the}} acquisition and processing of EMG signals. This article explores the use of EMGbased HMIs in the steering of farm tractors. An EPOC, a low-cost human-computer interface (HCI) from the Emotiv Company, was employed. This device, by means of 14 saline sensors, measures and processes EMG and electro encephalographic (EEG) signals from the scalp of the driver. In our tests, the HMI took into account only the detection of four trained muscular events on the driver’s scalp: <b>eyes</b> <b>looking</b> to the right and jaw opened, <b>eyes</b> <b>looking</b> to the right and jaw closed, <b>eyes</b> <b>looking</b> to the left and jaw opened, and <b>eyes</b> <b>looking</b> to the left and jaw closed. The EMG-based HMI guidance was compared wit...|$|R

2500|$|Scotsman arts editor Andrew Eaton-Lewis {{suggested}} that [...] "there's something troubling {{about the fact}} that the case against this painting is essentially that it makes a pretty young woman look less pretty and less young." [...] Eaton-Lewis commented that [...] "a portrait which makes Middleton appear older, more distinguished, and more ordinary is judged to be unfit for purpose" [...] was [...] "depressing". Another art critic, Fisun Güner, a freelance visual arts writer, also criticised the painting, mentioning that the hair is painted in a spread out wavy cascade which starts to look like an advertisement for a shampoo. Fisun makes the observation that the blouse in the big-bow shape, which she is wearing covered up to the neck, makes her appear [...] "stiff and rather straight-jacketed". However, Fisun believed the <b>eyes</b> <b>look</b> bright and lively and the jewellery, which she is shown wearing, stated to belong to her mother-in-law, are earrings made of sapphire and diamond, which bring out an animated look in the portrait.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins with}} Gomez lying seductively on a bright, lime-green, velvet couch; wearing a loosely tied, robe-like fuchsia dress, [...] her <b>eyes</b> <b>look</b> sad {{and she is}} {{seemingly}} awaiting the arrival of her partner. Gomez wears a [...] floral, pink and lavender dress. The video then alternates between scenes of Gomez writhing around on a hardwood floor in ripped denim and a white T-shirt. In the next scene, Gomez [...] undresses and takes a shower in slow-motion; though not explicitly nude, the scene focuses {{on her head and}} shoulders. Gomez is later depicted towering over a camera in a warehouse, before returning to scenes of her writhing around and expressing her inner longing. Gomez is also pictured with wet hair, sitting on a bar stool against a bare wall, wearing a wet white T-shirt; imagery reminiscent of single's cover art. It then alternates between a scene in which she wallows on an old-fashioned leather couch wearing a silk dress. Throughout the video, Gomez is pictured singing for the camera, often making direct eye contact with the viewer and seemingly lost in deep thought.|$|E
