40|$|ABSTRACT. The lateral {{distribution}} uniformity {{produced by}} several commercially available anhydrous ammonia (NH 3) manifold configurations was determined using a dynamic water absorption technique. For a conventional cast manifold, {{top and bottom}} inlet configurations were compared, as were open versus restricted manifold outlet barbs. Coefficient of variation for lateral distribution (lateral CVs) ranged from 15 to 20 % for the top inlet and from 8 to 10 % for the bottom inlet. For the conventional manifold, the use of open [(5. 6 mm ID (0. 22 in. ID) ] versus restrictor–type hose barbs [2. 4 mm ID (0. 09 in. ID) ] had little influence on lateral distribution. The Continental vertical dam manifold produced lateral CVs ranging from 10 to 13 %. For both manifolds, the influence of unequal <b>discharge</b> <b>hose</b> lengths was reduced as manifold pressure increased...|$|R

50|$|Booster {{pumps are}} usually piston or plunger type compressors. A single-acting, {{single-stage}} booster is the simplest configuration, and comprises a cylinder, designed {{to withstand the}} operating pressures, with a piston which is driven back and forth inside the cylinder. The cylinder head is fitted with supply and discharge ports, to which the supply and <b>discharge</b> <b>hoses</b> or pipes are connected, with a non-return valve on each, constraining flow in one direction from supply to discharge. When the booster is inactive, and the piston is stationary, gas will flow from the inlet hose, through the inlet valve into {{the space between the}} cylinder head and the piston. If the pressure in the outlet hose is lower, it will then flow out and to whatever the outlet hose is connected to. This flow will stop when the pressure is equalised, taking valve opening pressures into account.|$|R

50|$|The dry {{mix method}} {{involves}} placing {{the dry ingredients}} into a hopper and then conveying them pneumatically through a hose to the nozzle. The nozzleman controls the addition of water at the nozzle. The water and the dry mixture is not completely mixed, but is completed as the mixture hits the receiving surface. This requires a skilled nozzleman, {{especially in the case}} of thick or heavily reinforced sections. Advantages of the dry mix process are that the water content can be adjusted instantaneously by the nozzleman, allowing more effective placement in overhead and vertical applications without using accelerators. The dry mix process is useful in repair applications when it is necessary to stop frequently, as the dry material is easily <b>discharged</b> from the <b>hose.</b>|$|R
40|$|Tomco Equipment Company {{has participated}} in the dry ice (solid carbon dioxide, CO 2) {{cleaning}} industry for over ten years as {{a pioneer in the}} manufacturer of high density, dry ice cleaning pellet production equipment. For over four years Tomco high density pelletizers have been available to the dry ice cleaning industry. Approximately one year ago Tomco introduced the DI- 250, a new dry ice blast unit making Tomco a single source supplier for sublimable media, particle blast, cleaning systems. This new blast unit is an all pneumatic, single <b>discharge</b> <b>hose</b> device. It meters the insertion of 1 / 8 inch diameter (or smaller), high density, dry ice pellets into a high pressure, propellant gas stream. The dry ice and propellant streams are controlled and mixed from the blast cabinet. From there the mixture is transported to the nozzle where the pellets are accelerated to an appropriate blasting velocity. When directed to impact upon a target area, these dry ice pellets have sufficient energy to effectively remove most surface coatings through dry, abrasive contact. The meta-stable, dry ice pellets used for CO 2 cleaning, while labeled 'high density,' are less dense than alternate, abrasive, particle blast media. In addition, after contacting the target surface, they return to their equilibrium condition: a superheated gas state. Most currently used grit blasting media are silicon dioxide based, which possess a sharp tetrahedral molecular structure. Silicon dioxide crystal structures will always produce smaller sharp-edged replicas of the original crystal upon fracture. Larger, softer dry ice pellets do not share the same sharp-edged crystalline structures as their non-sublimable counterparts when broken. In fact, upon contact with the target surface, dry ice pellets will plastically deform and break apart. As such, dry ice cleaning is less harmful to sensitive substrates, workers and the environment than chemical or abrasive cleaning systems. Dry ice cleaning system components include: a dry ice pellet supply, a non-reactive propellant gas source, a pellet and propellant metering device, and a media transport and acceleration hose and nozzle arrangement. Dry ice cleaning system operating parameters include: choice of propellant gas, its pressure and temperature, dry ice mass flow rate, dry ice pellet size and shape, and acceleration nozzle configuration. These parameters may be modified to fit different applications. The growth of the dry ice cleaning industry will depend upon timely data acquisition of the effects that independent changes in these parameters have on cleaning rates, with respect to different surface coating and substrate combinations. With this data, optimization of cleaning rates for particular applications will be possible. The analysis of the applicable range of modulation of these parameters, within system component mechanical constraints, has just begun...|$|R

Some machine tool manuals proscribe this practice both for safety and for the preservation of way wipers and bearing seals. Alternatives to blowing chips away include vacuuming them away with an industrial vacuum (shop vacuum); gently washing them away with a coolant <b>hose</b> <b>discharging</b> at typical garden-hose pressures; or preventing their generation in the first place (for example, forming threads instead of cutting them).|$|R
25|$|The cost of {{breathing}} gas containing a high fraction of helium {{is a significant}} part of the cost of deep diving operations, and can be reduced by recovering the breathing gas for recycling. A reclaim helmet is provided with a return line in the diver's umbilical, and exhaled gas is <b>discharged</b> to this <b>hose</b> through a reclaim regulator, which ensures that gas pressure in the helmet cannot fall below the ambient pressure. The gas is processed at the surface in the helium reclaim system by filtering, scrubbing and boosting into storage cylinders until needed. The oxygen content may be adjusted when appropriate. The same principle is used in built-in breathing systems used to vent oxygen-rich treatment gases from a hyperbaric chamber, though those gases are generally not reclaimed. A diverter valve is provided to allow the diver to manually switch to open circuit if the reclaim valve malfunctions, and an underpressure flood valve allows water to enter the helmet to avoid a squeeze if the reclaim valve fails suddenly, allowing the diver time to switch to open circuit without injury.|$|R

40|$|To make {{full use}} of the <b>flexible</b> {{charging}} and <b>discharging</b> capabilities of {{the growing number of}} electric vehicles (EVs), a bidding strategy for EV aggregators to participate in a day-ahead electricity energy market is proposed in this work.

Agreements between the EV owners and the aggregators are discussed, and a hierarchical market structure is proposed. While assuming the aggregators as economic rational entities, the bidding strategy is established based on the market prices, extra battery charging/discharging costs and the expected profits. The bidding clearing system will display the current/temporal market clearance results of the day-ahead market before the final clearance, and hence the market participants can revise their bids and mitigate the risks, to some extent, of forecasted market price forecast errors.

40|$|Power demands will {{increase}} day-by-day because of widely adopting of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) {{in the world}} and growing population. Finding and managing additional power resources for upcoming demands is a challenge. Renewable power is one of the alternatives. However, to manage and control renewable resources, we need suitable Energy Storage System (ESS). PEVs have a large battery pack that is used mainly to supply electric motor. Moreover, PEV battery could be used as an ESS to store power at a certain time and use it at another time. Nevertheless, it can play the same role with electric power grids, so it can store power at a time and return it at another time. This role might help the grid to meet the growing demands. In this thesis, we propose a charging and discharging coordination algorithm that effectively addresses the problem of power demand on peak time using the PEV’s batteries as a backup power storage, namely, <b>Flexible</b> Charging and <b>Discharging</b> (FCD) algorithm. The FCD algorithm aims to manage high power demands at peak times using Vehicle to Home (V 2 H) technologies in Smart Grid and PEV’s batteries. Intensive computer simulation is used to test FCD algorithm. The FCD algorithm shows a significant reduction in power demands and total cost, in proportion to two other algorithms, without affecting the performance of the PEV or the flexibility of PEV owner’s trip schedule...|$|R

The flexible bands were used in thirty five patients before October 2006. Since then, the rigid rings {{were used in the}} next consecutive eighty two cases. Echocardiographic evaluation of tricuspid regurgitation was performed preoperatively and postoperatively in follow-up schedule. The degree of tricuspid regurgitation was reduced from 2. 80 ± 0. 67 to 0. 71 ± 1. 0 (regurgitation severity grade: 0 to 4) in the patients with <b>flexible</b> bands at <b>discharge.</b> It was from 2. 68 ± 0. 70 to 0. 22 ± 0. 60 in the patients with rigid rings. At thirty six months postoperative period, tricuspid regurgitation grades in patients with flexible bands and rigid rings were 0. 80 ± 0. 95 and 0. 36 ± 0. 77, respectively. Freedom from recurrent tricuspid regurgitation (grade 2 or 3) in patients with flexible bands and rigid rings were 68. 6 % and 87. 8 %, respectively. Recurrent tricuspid regurgitation was significantly lower in the patients with rigid rings. Although both flexible band and rigid ring annuloplasty provide low rate of recurrent tricuspid regurgitation, rigid ring annuloplasty might be more effective than flexible band annuloplasty for decreasing functional tricuspid regurgitation in immediate and mid-term postoperative periods...|$|R

40|$|Aim. To {{investigate}} general surgical patients' {{perspectives of}} the adequacy and appropriateness of their discharge planning. Objectives. To identify any aspects of discharge planning that could be strengthened to assist people in managing their posthospital care and maintaining continuity of care. Background. Appropriate discharge planning is a priority in today's healthcare environment in which patients are discharged 'quicker and sicker', sometimes without home support. Adequate and appropriate discharge planning helps promote health literacy, which has benefits for both patients and their caregivers in helping them manage postsurgical recovery at home. Design. A qualitative, interpretive study was designed in which patients were interviewed at least one week after they returned home from hospital. Methods. Purposeful sampling was used to interview 13 general surgical patients from one of three hospitals (two public and one private) in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. Data were collected in unstructured interviews and analysed using thematic analysis. Reflective analysis by individual research team members generated preliminary themes, which were then analysed collectively by {{all members of the}} research team to achieve consensus on patients' perspectives. Results. Themes included a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to providing discharge information; inconsistent or variable advice from different health professionals; a lack of predischarge assessment of their home and/or work conditions and the need for follow-up assessment of patient and carer needs. Conclusions. The findings of this study illuminate the need for a more individualized approach to discharge planning, taking into account the patient's age, gender, surgical procedure and family and community support for immediate and longer-term nursing follow-up. Relevance to clinical practice. Patients would be more adequately prepared for their recovery period at home, by encouraging client-centred, interdisciplinary communication between health practitioners; adopting a <b>flexible,</b> approach to <b>discharge</b> planning which is tailored to individual needs of postsurgical patients, particularly in relation to advice and information related to recovery; and encouraging and supporting adequate health literacy for self-management...|$|R
40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was {{requested}} {{to develop a}} bench scale test facility, using a mixer, transfer pump, and transfer line to determine the impact of conveying the grout through the transfer lines to the vault on grout properties. Bench scale testing focused on the effect the transfer line has on the rheological property of the grout as it was processed through the transfer line. Rheological and other physical properties of grout samples were obtained prior to and after pumping through a transfer line. The Bench Scale Mixing Rig (BSMR) consisted of two mixing tanks, grout feed tank, transfer pump and transfer hose. The mixing tanks were used to batch the grout which was then transferred into the grout feed tank. The contents of the feed tank were then pumped through the transfer line (hose) using a progressive cavity pump. The grout flow rate and pump discharge pressure were monitored. Four sampling stations were located {{along the length of}} the transfer line at the 5, 105 and 205 feet past the transfer pump and at 305 feet, the <b>discharge</b> of the <b>hose.</b> Scaling between the full scale piping at Saltstone to bench scale testing at SRNL was performed by maintaining the same shear rate and total shear at the wall of the transfer line. The results of scaling down resulted in a shorter transfer line, a lower average velocity, the same transfer time and similar pressure drops. The condition of flow in the bench scale transfer line is laminar. The flow in the full scale pipe is in the transition region, but is more laminar than turbulent. The resulting plug in laminar flow in the bench scale results in a region of no-mixing. Hence mixing, or shearing, at the bench scale should be less than that observed in the full scale, where this plug is non existent due to the turbulent flow. The bench scale tests should be considered to be conservative due to the highly laminar condition of flow that exists. Two BSMR runs were performed. In both cases, wall shearing was shown to reduce the rheological properties of the grout as it was processed through the transfer line. Samples taken at the static feed tank showed that gelling impacted the rheological properties of the grout before it was fed into the pump and transfer line. A comparison of the rheological properties of samples taken at the feed tank and transfer line discharge indicated shearing of the grout was occurring in the transfer line. Bench scale testing of different mixing methods with three different salt solutions showed that method of mixing influences the rheological properties of the grouts. The paddle blade mixing method of the salt solution used for the BMSR testing provided comparable rheological properties of the grout prepared in the BMSR after 14 minutes of processing, B 3. The paddle blade mixing method can be used to represent BMSR results and mixing time can be adjusted to represent larger scale mixing...|$|R
