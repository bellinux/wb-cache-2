Both field and <b>desk</b> <b>studies</b> have been used; this involved the administration of 200 questionnaires and focused group discussions. The <b>desk</b> <b>studies</b> included detailed literature review and analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) satellite images of vegetation and rainfall from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). The results show that cereal production has declined while rainfall has increased by 30 - 40 % in the last decade in the study area. With an increase in rainfall, the observed decline in cereal production cannot be explained by climate only. Land use changes such as deforestation patterns are significant in explaining the trends in cereal output as seen in population perceptions. </p...|$|R

50|$|Denby Transport, a Lincoln based haulage company {{owned by}} the Denby family, have been {{developing}} and testing the Eco-Link on private proving grounds since 2002. Denby believes that the Eco-Link offers several environmental and productivity benefits over normal lorries, without any decrease in safety, and that an active steering system used on the middle trailer gives the Eco-Link a manoeuvrability and turning circle equivalent to shorter legal LGVs. In 2004 Denby, among other UK hauliers, unsuccessfully applied for permission from the Department for Transport (DfT) to trial their LHV prototypes on the public road. In June 2008, after a two year <b>desk</b> <b>study</b> into LHV's, the DfT ruled out approval of trials of most designs LHV considered, including the Eco-Link.|$|E

50|$|In Finland, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, {{and some}} roads in Norway, trucks with {{trailers}} {{are allowed to}} be 25.25 m long. Elsewhere in the European Union, the limit is 18.75 m (Norway 19.5 m). The trucks are of a cab-over-engine design. These have a flat front and a high floor about 1.2 m above ground with the engine below. The Scandinavian countries are less densely populated than the other EU countries; and distances, especially in Finland and Sweden, are long. Until the late 1960s, vehicle length was unlimited, giving rise to long vehicles to handle goods cost effectively. As traffic increased, lengths became more of a concern and they were limited, albeit at a more generous level than {{in the rest of}} Europe. In the United Kingdom in 2009, a two-year <b>desk</b> <b>study</b> of Longer Heavier Vehicles (LHVs) including options up to 11-axle, 34 m long, 82 t combinations, ruled out all road train type vehicles for the foreseeable future.In 2010, Sweden was performing tests on log hauling trucks, weighing up to 90 t and measuring 30 m and haulers for two 40 ft containers, measuring 32 m in total.|$|E
5000|$|Although the Department for Transport {{advised that}} the Eco-Link was not {{permissible}} on public roads, Denby Transport gave the Police prior {{warning of the}} timing and route of the test drive on the public highway, as well as outlining their position in writing to the Eastern Traffic Area Office. On 1 December 2009 Denby Transport were preparing to drive the Eco-Link on public roads, but this was cut short because the Police pulled the semi-trailer truck over as it left the gates {{in order to test}} it for its legality [...] "to investigate any... offenses which may be found". The Police said the vehicle was unlawful due to its length and Denby Transport was served with a notice by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) inspector to remove the vehicle from the road for inspection. Having returned to the yard, Denby Transport was formally notified by Police and VOSA that the semi-trailer truck could not be used. Neither the Eco-Link, nor any other B-Train, have since been permitted on UK roads. However, this prompted the Department for Transport to undertake a <b>desk</b> <b>study</b> in to semi-trailer trucks, which has resulted in the longer semi-trailer trial which commenced in 2012.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a natural}} follow on from the <b>desk</b> <b>study,</b> the {{objectives}} are similar - acquiring sufficient information for design, assessing the hazards. Depending on the works the investigations will differ i.e. defects of existing works, slope failure or new works.Soil profile and groundwater condition should be established. Temporary or permanent changes should be investigated this involves changes in stresses and strains, moisture content, strength and compressibility. Certain areas will have old mines and underground cavities which need investigation. The ground investigation should be given enough time to be conducted before works are designed, this may involve in predicting ground condition at various times of the year. Due to the potential flexibility and size of an investigation, adequate supervision, equipment, testing, personnel, and audits should be provided in a safe manner. The extent of the GI can depend on many variables such as, character of site, availability of equipment and personnel and costs of methods. It should cover all ground affected by stresses and strains to an appropriate depth and breadth. Excavations, boreholes probing and geophysical surveying are used to investigate the ground. Intrusive investigations should be sited, spaced and backfilled with care. The GI should give sufficient information to make good decisions on design, construction material selection. The condition and accessibility on site may affect the equipment used. As the determination of groundwater conditions is important - the use of piezometers are at times used. Ground conditions from rock and gravel through to silts and clays will determine the equipments and approach used in the ground investigations as will made up, contaminated ground and under water ground. Geotechnical specialists {{are used in the}} investigation and interpretation of results.|$|E

50|$|A wide view on {{approaches}} and practices on self-assessment of competence in Adult education {{is offered by}} a European project VINTAGE - online tool for self eValuatIoN of key competences in adulT AGE that reports a <b>desk</b> <b>study</b> focused on the acquisition and self-assessment of key competences in adult education in Italy, Austria, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands and Sweden. The VINTAGE self-assessment framework has been tested during seven parallel focus group sessions, in the six partner Countries, involving roughly hundred experts and practitioners at European level. The self-assessment procedure offers an innovative alternative to common knowledge based multiple-choice questionnaires to evaluate competences. It assigns an active role to the user, calling upon reflective abilities, self-assessment competences and self-responsibility. The procedure focuses on the Lifelong Learning approach, aiming to offer a tool for personal empowerment and development, rather than for solely selective or professional purposes.Vintage assessment framework focuses on actual behavior a person is demonstrating in a realistic context, or rather a reconstruction of a realistic context in a particular situation, evaluating the mastery level {{and the quality of}} the performance. This chosen approach towards the assessment of learning outcomes and competences is as well supported by research that highlights the importance of the performance side in demonstrating (key) competence within the field of education and lifelong learning. It is a process that requires involvement and participation by the user and reflection, bringing into play meta-competences typical of the self-assessment process and therefore particularly suited to an adult context. Engaging the user in such an active and responsible way additionally improves the self-assessment competences and aims at raising motivation of the adult learner and supporting the idea of self-directness of lifelong learning.|$|E
50|$|Seven {{factors to}} be {{cognizant}} of at this stage are: suitability of {{the site for the}} proposed works, economic and adequacy of design, optimum method of construction with reference to potential issues due to ground and groundwater. The effect of changes to the ground and environment due to the works, and, therefore the effect on the works from these changes. Consideration of suitability on a selection of sites. And finally, the existing works and their implications. If a site has been used in the past, this is {{a major factor in the}} investigation, mining, quarrying, landfill or waste disposal, industrial usages, archaeological or ecological factors may all have a bearing on the intended works. The cost of an SI is low relative to the project cost and when conducted thoroughly can be a significant saving later.Investigations should evaluate the nature of the ground and groundwater. The size and nature of the works will have a bearing on the investigations as will its former use as a site or contamination of ground or groundwater. It will be considered in 3 stages. First a <b>desk</b> <b>study</b> to collate the information above as far as possible. Where a site is contaminated it is appropriate at this stage to plan site safety procedures for any further investigations. Planning the details of further investigations is appropriate too. Existing records, local authorities, industry, libraries, present or past OS maps and aerial photography or even anecdotal information are to be used. A site reconnaissance should also be conducted at this stage and includes a thorough visual inspection of any exposed cuttings and note taken of level of vegetation. The surroundings should also be noted. Second, a more detailed investigation is undertaken and finally a construction review - these shall be discussed later.|$|E
