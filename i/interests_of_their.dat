In fact, minority representatives are required to vote according to their party line; they are not allowed to vote specifically in the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> racial groups. The multiracial element in Parliament has been artificially imposed by way of a racial quota to ensure that the minorities are represented.|$|E

Said advocated {{the establishment of a}} Palestinian state to ensure equal political and human rights for the Palestinians in Israel, including the right of return to the homeland. He defined his oppositional relation with the status quo as the remit of the public intellectual who has “to sift, to judge, to criticize, to choose, so that choice and agency return to the individual” man and woman.|$|E
5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E

Local Boards of Guardians also interpreted the law to suit the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own parishes, resulting in an even greater degree of local variation.|$|E

In 1924, the Punjab Unionist party was established to follow this policy as a role model among of course other objectives such as to protect the interest of the landed classes.|$|E

In consideration of the strategic and economic <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> new ally Czechoslovakia, however, the victorious allies set the Czechoslovak–Hungarian border further south than the Slovak–Hungarian language border. Consequently, the newly created state contained areas that were overwhelmingly ethnic Hungarian.|$|E

He {{was the first}} to create a {{taxonomy}} of animals; he perceived some similarities between humans and other species, but argued for the most part that animals lacked reason (logos), reasoning (logismos), thought (dianoia, nous), and belief (doxa).|$|E

25|$|This was {{of great}} {{relevance}} to Gregory {{himself as he}} presided over the important see of Tours, where extensive use {{was made of the}} cult of St. Martin in establishing the authority of the bishopric with the congregation and {{in the context of the}} Frankish church. Gregory's hagiography was an essential component of this. However, this should not be seen as a selfish grab for power on behalf of the bishops who emerge so triumphantly from the Life of the Fathers, but rather as a bid for hegemony of doctrine and control over the practice of worship, which they believed to be in the best <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> congregation and the wider church.|$|E
