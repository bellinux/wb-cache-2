50|$|Fecund universes is a multiverse {{theory of}} Lee Smolin {{about the role}} of black holes. The theory has black holes and loop quantum gravity {{connecting}} <b>early</b> <b>universes</b> together. Loop quantum gravity can be pulled into black holes. In Fecund universes, each new universes, according to Lee Smolin, has slightly different laws of physics.

50|$|This {{contrasts}} with the approach used by some big historians who divide the narrative into many more thresholds, {{as noted in the}} discussion {{at the end of this}} section below.

5|$|The {{field is}} so small {{that only a few}} {{foreground}} stars in the Milky Way lie within it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are galaxies, some of which are among the youngest and most distant known.

5|$|A {{hierarchical}} structure of matter began to form from minute {{variations in the}} mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and {{are believed to have}} created many of the heavy elements in the <b>early</b> <b>Universe,</b> which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.|$|E
40|$|Cosmology is {{an attempt}} to mathematically {{describe}} the behaviour of the universe, the most commonly used models are the Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker solutions. These models seem to be accurate for an old universe, which is homogeneous with low anisotropy. However for an <b>earlier</b> <b>universe</b> these models might not be that accurate or even correct. The almost non-existent anisotropy observed today might have played a bigger role in the <b>earlier</b> <b>universe.</b> For this reason we will study another model known as Bianchi Type I, where the universe is not necessarily isotropic. We utilize a 1 + 3 -covariant formalism to obtain the equations that determine the behaviour of the universe and then use a tetrad formalism to complement the 1 + 3 -covariant equations. Using these equations we examine the geometry of space-time and its dynamical properties. Finally we briefly discuss the different singularities possible and examine some special cases of geodesic movement...|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the <b>early</b> <b>{{universe}}'s</b> inflationary period, all {{the matter}} and energy in the universe was set on an inertial trajectory consistent with the equivalence principle and Einstein's general theory of relativity and this is when the precise and regular form of the universe's expansion had its origin (that is, matter in the universe is separating because it was separating in the past due to the inflaton field).|$|R
50|$|The <b>earliest</b> <b>universe</b> is opaque {{since the}} cosmos was so {{energetic}} then that most matter was ionized and photons were scattered by free electrons. However, this opacity would not affect gravitational waves from that time, {{so if they}} occurred at levels strong enough to be detected at this distance, it would allow a window to observe the cosmos beyond the current visible universe. Gravitational-wave astronomy therefore may some day allow direct observation of the earliest history of the universe.|$|R
5|$|Currently, {{a number}} of {{land-based}} gravitational wave detectors are in operation, and a mission to launch a space-based detector, LISA, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) which was launched in 2015.

5|$|Formation of {{the carbon}} atomic nucleus {{requires}} a nearly simultaneous triple collision of alpha particles (helium nuclei) within {{the core of a}} giant or supergiant star which is known as the triple-alpha process, as the products of further nuclear fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce lithium-5 and beryllium-8 respectively, both of which are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei. This happens in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvin and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of the <b>early</b> <b>universe</b> prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Max Tegmark {{developed}} a four-part classification scheme {{for the different}} types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in various problem domains.

Parallel worlds are generated {{in a manner similar to}} quantum superposition and decoherence, with all states of the wave function being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of a cosmological model of the Universe filled with a nonrelativistic particle soup, we easily reproduce inflation due to the quantum potential. The lightest particles in the soup serve as a driving force of this simple, natural and promising mechanism. It is explicitly demonstrated that the appropriate choice of their mass and fraction leads to reasonable numbers of e-folds. Thus, the direct introduction of the quantum potential into cosmology of the <b>earliest</b> <b>Universe</b> gives ample opportunities of successful reconsideration of the modern inflationary theory.

5|$|Observations of {{gravitational}} waves promise to complement observations in the electromagnetic spectrum.

5|$|Populations {{of stars}} have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are {{observed}} {{as they were}} in the <b>early</b> <b>universe)</b> appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} {{consistency}} between a quantum description {{of matter and}} a geometric description of spacetime, {{as well as the}} appearance of singularities (where curvature length scales become microscopic), indicate the need for a full theory of quantum gravity: for an adequate description of the interior of black holes, and of the very <b>early</b> <b>universe,</b> a theory is required in which gravity and the associated geometry of spacetime are described in the language of quantum physics. Despite major efforts, no complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity is currently known, even though a number of promising candidates exist.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ownership is a {{powerful}} concept to structure the object store and to control aliasing and modifications of objects. This paper presents an ownership type system for a Java-like programming language with generic types. Like our <b>earlier</b> <b>Universe</b> type system, Generic Universe Types enforce the owner-as-modifier discipline. This discipline does not restrict aliasing, but requires modifications of an object to be initiated by its owner. This allows owner objects to control state changes of owned objects, for instance, to maintain invariants. Generic Universe Types require a small annotation overhead and provide strong static guarantees. They are the first type system that combines the owner-as-modifier discipline with type genericity. ...|$|R
40|$|Black holes, {{an extreme}} {{consequence}} of the mathematics of General Relativity, have long been suspected of being the prime movers of quasars, which emit more energy than any other objects in the Universe. Recent evidence indicates that supermassive black holes, which are probably quasar remnants, reside at the centers of most galaxies. As {{our knowledge of the}} demographics of these relics of a violent <b>earlier</b> <b>Universe</b> improve, we see tantalizing clues that they participated intimately in the formation of galaxies and have strongly influenced their present-day structure.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the electric and magnetic components in an effective Yang-Mills condensate dark energy model is investigated. If the electric field is dominant, the magnetic component disappears with {{the expansion of the}} Universe. The total YM condensate tracks the radiation in the <b>earlier</b> <b>Universe,</b> and later it becomes w_y‚àº- 1 thus is similar to the cosmological constant. So the cosmic coincidence problem can be avoided in this model. However, if the magnetic field is dominant, w_y> 1 / 3 holds for all time, suggesting that it cannot be a candidate for the dark energy in this case.

5|$|The first non-visual {{study of}} galaxies, {{particularly}} active galaxies, was made using radio frequencies. The Earth's atmosphere is nearly transparent to radio between 5MHz and 30GHz. (The ionosphere blocks signals below this range.) Large radio interferometers {{have been used}} to map the active jets emitted from active nuclei. Radio telescopes {{can also be used to}} observe neutral hydrogen (via 21cm radiation), including, potentially, the non-ionized matter in the <b>early</b> <b>Universe</b> that later collapsed to form galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} monopole objection {{was raised in}} the late 1970s. Grand unified theories predicted topological defects in space that would manifest as {{magnetic monopole}}s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot <b>early</b> <b>universe,</b> resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by cosmic inflation, which removes all point defects from the observable universe, {{in the same way that}} it drives the geometry to flatness.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{window on}} the Universe enabled by Hubble are the Hubble Deep Field, Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, and Hubble Extreme Deep Field images, which used Hubble's {{unmatched}} sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are the deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{cumulative}} CO emission from galaxies throughout cosmic history distorts the spectrum of {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) at a level that is well above the detection limit of future instruments, such as the Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE). The modeled CO signal has a prominent bump in the frequency interval 100 - 200 GHz, with a characteristic peak intensity of 2 √ó 10 ^- 23 W m^- 2 Hz^- 1 sr^- 1. Most of the CO foreground originates from modest redshifts, z 2 - 5, and needs to be efficiently removed for more subtle distortions from the <b>earlier</b> <b>universe</b> to be detected.

40|$|Compact {{groups of}} galaxies provide a unique {{environment}} {{to study the}} evolution of galaxies amid frequent gravitational encounters. These nearby groups have conditions {{similar to those in}} the <b>earlier</b> <b>universe</b> when galaxies were assembled and give us the opportunity to witness hierarchical formation in progress. To understand how the compact group environment affects galaxy evolution, we examine the gas and dust in these groups. We present new single-dish GBT neutral hydrogen (HI) observations of 30 compact groups and define a new way to quantify the group HI content as the HI-to-stellar mass ratio of the group as a whole. We compare the HI content with mid-IR indicators of star formation and optical [g-r] color to search for correlations between group gas content and star formation activity of individual group members. Quiescent galaxies tend to live in HI-poor groups, and galaxies with active star formation are more commonly found in HI-rich groups. Intriguingly, we also find "rogue" galaxies whose star formation does not correlate with group HI content. In particular, we identify three galaxies (NGC 2968 in RSCG 34, KUG 1131 + 202 A in RSCG 42, and NGC 4613 in RSCG 64) whose mid-IR activity is discrepant with the HI. We speculate that this mismatch between mid-IR activity and HI content is a consequence of strong interactions in this environment that can strip HI from galaxies and abruptly affect star-formation. Ultimately, characterizing how and on what timescales the gas is processed in compact groups will help us understand the interstellar medium in complex, dense environments similar to the <b>earlier</b> <b>Universe.</b> Comment: Accepted to A...|$|R
5|$|Although the {{properties}} of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent {{of the value of}} the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, Andrew Strominger introduced a version of the duality called the dS/CFT correspondence. This duality involves a model of spacetime called de Sitter space with a positive cosmological constant. Such a duality is interesting from the point of view of cosmology since many cosmologists believe that the very <b>early</b> <b>universe</b> was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the distant future.|$|E
5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, {{is a physical}} process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) in the <b>early</b> <b>universe,</b> making the universe itself and {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Big Bang, {{primordial}} protons and neutrons formed from the quark‚Äìgluon plasma of the <b>early</b> <b>Universe</b> as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, {{in a process}} known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons. This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to lithium and beryllium, but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some boron may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, carbon, was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding Universe. Subsequent formation of heavier elements resulted from stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis.|$|E
