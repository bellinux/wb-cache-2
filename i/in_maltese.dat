5|$|Examinations <b>in</b> <b>Maltese</b> {{secondary}} schools are taken at both age 16 and 18, {{with the latter}} being a final optional set of matriculation examinations. The examinations taken at age 16 are the Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) exams, which have operated since 1994, before which the GCE Ordinary Level {{was used as a}} secondary certificate examination. The examinations taken at 18, those enabling entry into university, are the Matriculation Certificate examinations, based on the International Baccalaureate. These examinations replaced the GCE Advanced Levels.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1846 {{education}} became effectively compulsory {{till the}} age of 14. In 1847, elementary schooling was changed to the British model, schools were opened in every village and education was made free of charge. In 1878, the mode of language education delivery changed following the publication of two reports on the matter. Italian language education was replaced by instruction in the English language, {{and the use of}} Maltese was encouraged in the primary years. However, English was the language in which education was delivered at all stages of education following primary school. Debate continued until the 1930s over which language should be used <b>in</b> <b>Maltese</b> education - Italian or English.|$|E
5|$|Sea vessels were {{required}} by law to register at the Castellania to operate <b>in</b> <b>Maltese</b> waters and each had to pay a minimum ten grani, {{depending on the size of}} the vessel and its purpose. With the Registri Patentarum, the Castellania issued legal patents for galleys to travel from the port of Valletta to other ports and vice versa. The patents gave details subject to health inspections which included the names of the merchants and the description of the belongings for trade. Those galleys coming from non-European ports or from places subjected to possible disease were withheld in quarantine for days and only given permission to mix with the rest of the people once a Pratica was issued by the Commission of Public Health. The Clean Bill of Health continued to be issued and gradually reformed during the British period, under the supervision of the Chief Medical Officer. The Castellania imposed a charge for those not having health assurance and having to lodge at the Lazzaretto.|$|E

25|$|Traces of the {{ascendancy}} of the Crown of Aragon in the Mediterranean, and Spanish governance over Malta from 1282 to 1530, are still evident <b>in</b> <b>Maltese</b> culture today. These include culinary, religious, and musical influences. Two examples are the enduring importance of the Spanish guitar (Maltese: il-kitarra Spanjola) <b>in</b> <b>Maltese</b> folk music, and the enclosed wooden balconies (Maltese: gallerija) that grace traditional Maltese homes today. It {{is also possible that}} the traditional Maltese costume, the Faldetta, is a local variation of the Spanish mantilla.|$|E

25|$|Maltese il- is coincidentally {{identical}} in pronunciation {{to the one}} of the Italian masculine articles, il, which is also l’ before, but not after, a vowel.
