5|$|Saville and Fairchild went to Congress in 1950, and {{obtained}} $114million {{for the development}} of an electronic computer-based air <b>defense</b> <b>system,</b> a project headed by George E. Valley Jr, who was a physicist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The computer, named Whirlwind, helped the USAF develop the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air <b>defense</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

25|$|Units {{operating}} these specially equipped aircraft {{were designated}} <b>Defense</b> <b>Systems</b> Evaluation Squadrons (DSES). The 4713th <b>Defense</b> <b>Systems</b> Evaluation Squadron was stationed for {{training in the}} Northeast. The 4713th also deployed frequently to USAFE in West Germany for training of NATO forces. The other was the 4677th <b>Defense</b> <b>Systems</b> Evaluation Squadron, which concentrated on Fighter Interceptor Squadron training for units in the Western United States. In 1974, the 4713th DSES was inactivated and its EB-57s were divided between two Air National Guard units and the 4677th DSES was redesignated as the 17th <b>Defense</b> <b>Systems</b> Evaluation Squadron. This unit was inactivated in July 1979 and {{was the last to}} fly B-57s in the active duty USAF. It shared the <b>Defense</b> <b>Systems</b> Evaluation mission with the Kansas and Vermont Air National Guard. <b>Defense</b> <b>Systems</b> Evaluation operations were also carried out by the 6091st Reconnaissance Squadron, Yokota AB, Japan; later the 556th Reconnaissance Squadron and moved to Kadena AB, Okinawa. EB-57s were also deployed to Alaskan Air Command, Elmendorf AFB, Alaska, frequently.|$|R
5|$|Historical {{accounts}} date Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle to {{the early}} 14th century, although recent archaeological evidence has proved human existence in the area back to the 12th or 13th century. Initially built to protect the bridge connecting the city with the mainland, the castle sits {{on top of a}} peninsula carved out by the winding Smotrych River, forming a natural <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> for Kamianets-Podilskyi's historic Old Town neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the older AN/MPQ-53 Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) radar set of the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-2, the Green Pine is an {{active electronically scanned array}} (AESA) solid state radar. Unlike the advanced AN/TPY-2 X band radar of the Terminal High Altitude Area <b>Defense</b> <b>system,</b> Green Pine operates at L band - in the range 500 MHz to 1,000MHz, or 1,000MHz to 2,000MHz.|$|E
5|$|The JNA was {{initially}} formed during World War II {{to carry out}} guerrilla warfare against occupying Axis forces. The success of the Partisan movement led to the JNA basing much of its operational strategy on guerrilla warfare, as its plans normally entailed defending against NATO or Warsaw Pact attacks, where other types of warfare would put the JNA in a comparatively poor position. That approach led to maintenance of a Territorial <b>Defense</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|Missile <b>defense</b> <b>systems</b> are a type {{of missile}} defense {{intended}} to shield a country against incoming missiles, such as intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBMs) or other ballistic missiles. The United States, Russia, India, France and Israel have all developed missile <b>defense</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|The joint {{exercises}} {{were expected}} to test Israeli and American air <b>defense</b> <b>systems,</b> particularly Israel's ballistic missile defense against incoming missiles and rockets.

5|$|Design {{work on the}} Sachsen class {{began in}} 1872 and lasted until 1874. The ships were {{intended}} {{to operate in the}} Baltic Sea as a primary component of an integrated coastal <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> proposed by General Albrecht von Stosch, the Chief of the Admiralty. Stosch designated the ships Ausfallkorvetten (sortie corvettes), denoting their intended use. In the event of war with a superior naval power and the imposition of a naval blockade, the Sachsen-class ships would sortie from fortified bases to attack the blockaders. They also had the task of breaking up landing attempts. The German railway network linked the bases so ground forces could be transferred to the sites of enemy landings.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian air {{and naval}} forces began bombing and {{shelling}} raids in the Saudi southwestern city of Najran and the coastal town of Jizan, which were staging points for royalist forces. In response, the Saudis purchased a British Thunderbird air <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> and developed their airfield in Khamis Mushayt. Riyadh also attempted to convince Washington to respond on its behalf. President Kennedy sent only a wing of jet fighters and bombers to Dhahran Airbase, demonstrating to Nasser {{the seriousness of}} American commitment to defending U.S. interests in Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Bethe, {{along with}} IBM {{physicist}} Richard Garwin, {{published an article}} criticising in detail the anti-ICBM <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> proposed by the Department of Defense. The two physicists described in the article that nearly any measure taken by the US would be easily thwarted with the deployment of relatively simple decoys.

5|$|Meanwhile, a shuttlepod {{containing}} Sub-Commander T'Pol, Lieutenant Reed, Ensign Mayweather and MACO Corporal Hawkins, departs {{to investigate}} a nearby sphere {{in order to try}} to collect more data on the Sphere Builders (who are now becoming increasingly concerned with the human threat). The away team successfully enters an exhaust vent, and reaching the core, they are able to retrieve a memory module. The intrusion alerts an automated <b>defense</b> <b>system,</b> however, and Hawkins is disintegrated helping the others escape.|$|E
5|$|Nike-X was an {{anti-ballistic missile}} (ABM) system {{designed}} in the 1960s by the US Army to protect major cities in the United States from attacks by the Soviet Union's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fleet during the Cold War. The X in the name referred to its experimental basis and {{was supposed to be}} replaced by a more appropriate name when the system was put into production. This never came to pass; the Nike-X program was canceled and replaced by a much lighter <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> known as Sentinel.|$|E

5|$|Before the launch, Metroplex sacrifices {{himself by}} {{transferring}} {{all of his}} Energon to the Ark. Optimus then calls for the launch to try and escape through the portal before it closes, but the Decepticons arrive in the Nemesis to stop them. Soundwave leads {{the first wave of}} troops onto the ship through giant cables and destroys the Arks automated <b>defense</b> <b>system.</b> Optimus sends Jetfire into space to disengage the cables. Bruticus launches from the Nemesis and destroys the Arks fuel line before being fatally injured and blasted off the ship into empty space by Jazz and Jetfire. Nearby, Bumblebee takes the fatal hit for Optimus and the two rival leaders engage in a battle to death. Depending on the players choice to play as either Optimus or Megatron, one manages to defeat the other and deal a fatal blow. But before the final blow can be dealt, both Optimus and Megatron are pulled off of the hull of the Ark and into the portal with both ships. The portal finally closes, leaving their home planet in peace and quiet.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{protection}} scheme of the Yamato class still suffered from several major design flaws and shortcomings. The torpedo <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> performed substantially worse than designed; in particular, very poor jointing between the upper-belt and lower-belt armour created a rupture-prone seam {{just below the}} waterline, causing the class to be susceptible to torpedoes. Other structural weaknesses existed near {{the bow of the}} vessels, where the armour plating was generally thinner. These deficiencies proved crucial, particularly for the first two members of the class when they were each seriously damaged by submarine torpedoes in 1943 and then sunk by torpedo bombers in 1944â€“45. The hull of the Shinano was subject to even greater structural weaknesses, being hastily constructed {{near the end of the}} war and having been equipped with incomplete armour and unsealed watertight compartments at the time of her sinking.|$|E
5|$|In Chiapas, {{one person}} from Guatemala died and four others were injured when their bus rolled over as it {{traveled}} over a damaged highway. The state's civil <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> reported that 984 families from 17 municipalities were evacuated to shelters, and that Alex's torrential rainfall also produced 23 landslides in six counties of the state. On June30, a mudslide knocked down a tree onto a 115-kV transmission line near El Vergel, causing 82 {{cities and towns}} in the municipalities of Villaflores and Villa Corzo to lose power; 32,000 residents were left without electricity from this outage alone. Power was restored the same evening. In YucatÃ¡n, a boat carrying seven passengers capsized; all were eventually rescued. In Campeche, 937 dwellings suffered minor damage {{as a result of}} the storm.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} is thought by some foreign policy analysts {{to be the}} basis for President George W. Bush's axis of evil line in his 2002 State of the Union Address, in which he accused Iraq, Iran, and North Korea of being state sponsors of terrorism and of pursuing weapons of mass destruction. The Rumsfeld Commission grouped the three countries together because they all were believed to be pursuing ballistic missile programs based on the Scud missile. In the pre-9/11 days of the Bush presidency, the administration had focused heavily on developing a national missile <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> to counter such threats. A month after the address, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who appointed Rumsfeld as head of the commission, mentioned the importance of the commission's findings in relation to the US ability to predict the threat posed by the axis members.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{president}} Ronald Reagan's and Navy Secretary John Lehman's {{effort to create}} a 600-ship Navy, New Jersey was selected for reactivation in the spring of 1981, and she was towed from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to Long Beach Naval Shipyard at the end of July 1981 for modernization/reactivation. At the time of the reactivation the Navy envisioned using New Jersey and her sister ship Iowa to meet sustained global requirements and relieve the strain on the Navy created by an increase in U.S. commitments to the Indian Ocean and Caribbean Sea regions. During this time the Navy developed several proposals to update their battleships to carry cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as point <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> mounts. Preliminary modernizations schemes included the removal of four of the ten 5inch gun mounts on New Jersey {{to make room for the}} armored box launchers that would be required to carry and launch the BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles. At one point the NATO Sea Sparrow was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the overpressure effects when firing the main battery.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of Sasanian rule, a number of buffer states existed between the empires. These were absorbed by the central state over time, and by the 7th century the last buffer state, the Arab Lakhmids, was annexed to the Sasanian Empire. Frye notes that in the 3rd centuryAD such client states {{played an important role}} in RomanSasanian relations, but both empires gradually replaced them by an organized <b>defense</b> <b>system</b> run by the central government and based on a line of fortifications (the limes) and the fortified frontier cities, such as Dara. Towards the end of the 1st centuryAD, Rome organized the protection of its eastern frontiers through the limes system, which lasted until the Muslim conquests of the 7th century after improvements by Diocletian. Like the Romans, the Sasanians constructed defensive walls opposite the territory of their opponents. According to R. N. Frye, it was under Shapur II that the Persian system was extended, probably in imitation of Diocletian's construction of the limes of the Syrian and Mesopotamian frontiers of the Roman Empire. The Roman and Persian border units were known as limitanei and marzobans, respectively.|$|E
