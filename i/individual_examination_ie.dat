40|$|The bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the {{description}} of the individual imaging methods of vertebral canal. Presentation of indications concerning the individual imaging methods. Description of what is the task of radiology assistant when conducting them. To reach the objectives of the bachelor's thesis, the following sources were used: study of specialized literature, monitoring of the individual practices at the radiology work places and department of nuclear medicine, practical execution of certain examinations under professional supervision, and consultation of the concerned issue with the physicians and radiology assistants of the respective work places. The theoretical part of the bachelor thesis describes the anatomy of vertebral column and vertebral canal. Certain parts are documented by pictures. The pathological states affecting vertebral column and vertebral canal are briefly mentioned here. The practical part describes the individual imaging methods of vertebral canal with regard to basic principles and practical procedure. The <b>individual</b> <b>examinations</b> are described by pictures. In addition, the task of radiology assistant is described by pictures. In addition, the task of radiology assistant is described here in steps when executing <b>individual</b> <b>examinations</b> and the indications are presented concerning the individual imaging methods. The answer to the research question "What is the task of radiology assistant when examining vertebral canal using the individual imaging methods?", is: not substitutable. Radiology assistant conducts before the examination, in the course of it, and after its termination, a number of activities necessary for its completion. Also the communication with patients and the whole health care team is the important part of his/her work. The bachelor work can serve as the initial information on the imaging methods that are currently used when examining vertebral canal, indications of the individual methods, and provision of radiology assistants with the assistance when conducting <b>individual</b> <b>examinations...</b>|$|R

Several studies have investigated the clinical impact of FDG PET-CT on management decisions, {{but there is a}} wide range of figures (12 – 57.8  %) quoted in the literature [16, 18, 22 – 26]. This is due to varied study methodologies; in particular, {{the presence or absence of}} comparative baseline imaging prior to FDG PET-CT examination and heterogeneous patient cohorts undergoing FDG PET-CT <b>examination,</b> <b>i.e.</b> inclusion of patients with all AJCC stages of MM with both primary and recurrent disease, which makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions for the use of FDG PET-CT in specific patient groups.|$|R
