5|$|As Roosevelt {{became more}} radical in his progressivism, Taft was {{hardened}} in his resolve to achieve re-nomination, {{as he was}} convinced that the progressives threatened the very foundation of the government. One blow to Taft was the loss of Archibald Butt, one of the last links between the previous and present presidents, as Butt had formerly served Roosevelt. Ambivalent between his loyalties, Butt went to Europe on vacation in early 1912. He sailed for home in April on the Titanic and died in its sinking, a death Taft found <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> as his body was not recovered.|$|E

Thus Lithuanian nationalist leaned more and more towards the Soviet side. Polish negotiators made some more progress in negotiations with Latvian Provisional Government, and in early 1920 Polish and Latvian forces were conducting some joint operations against Soviets.|$|E

In the meantime, Polish–Lithuanian relations worsened as Polish politicians found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the Lithuanians' demands for certain territories, especially the city of Vilnius which had a Polish ethnic majority but was regarded by Lithuanians as their historical capital. Polish negotiators made better progress with the Latvian Provisional Government, and in late 1919 and early 1920 Polish and Latvian forces were conducting joint operations including the Battle of Daugavpils, against Soviet Russia.|$|E

It makes its own virtues intolerable; puritanism won't let you see how good and beautiful the Puritans often are.

25|$|Dan is {{introduced}} {{a few days}} into his new role as a consultant and is {{an old friend of}} registrar Greg Douglas (Edward MacLiam). He starts mentoring ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), during her nurse consultant training. He has a hard time teaching her the importance of delegation in a consultant role. They become close and later start dating. Chrissie becomes stressed with the pressure of work, so Dan organises a trip abroad. He later realises she wants to relax, so he cancels and his relationship with Chrissie strengthens. The father of Chrissie's child, registrar Sacha Levy (Bob Barret) finds it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> that Chrissie has moved on. The situation worsens when they have conflicting views on medicine. Dan decides to put his surgeon skills to the test when consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) challenges him to complete his list of operations first. Feeling competitive, Dan rushes through an operation and makes an error. He gets Ric to step in to save the patient, with Ric taking the blame. Dan starts to feel like his relationship with Chrissie isn't going anywhere fast, so he invites her around to consummate their relationship. Chrissie is annoyed by Dan pressuring her, he tries to make things right again.|$|E

500|$|The {{work was}} an {{immediate}} critical and popular success. The satire was heightened by Gibbons's mockery of purple prose, whereby she marked the most florid and overwritten passages of the book with asterisks, [...] "for the reader's delectation and mirth". One critic found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> that so well-developed a parody {{was the work of}} a scarcely known woman writer, and speculated that [...] "Stella Gibbons" [...] was a pen-name for Evelyn Waugh. Gibbons suddenly found herself in demand in literary circles and from fellow writers, raised to a celebrity [...] status that she found distasteful. She acquired an [...] agent, [...] who advised her that she could confidently expect a regular and comfortable income as a novelist. This assurance prompted her, at the end of 1932, to resign her position with The Lady and to embark on a full-time writing career.|$|E

When Annie Hawkins, a hunter friend of the three, calls for assistance before being killed by the house's ghost, Bobby follows the Winchesters via the flask and discovers Annie dead with a myriad of other ghosts unable to move on from their place of death. Determined to get out information, Bobby learns to manipulate physical objects and points Dean and Sam in the right direction, and {{they are able to}} destroy the ghost haunting the house before the ghost could destroy Bobby. At the end of the episode, having accepted Bobby's return, Bobby is now fully visible to the Winchesters and explains to them how he chose to remain behind; a choice Dean finds <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept.</b>|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. {{requested}} {{in press}} releases that critics {{not discuss the}} film's ending. Richard Schickel of Time magazine disregarded the request and revealed Rusty's innocence in his review. He wrote, [...] "Carolyn's murderer has an excellent motive both for killing her... But it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> {{the possibility that the}} real perpetrator would leave his escape from the trap entirely to chance." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel surmised, [...] "It's not that Warner Bros. is actually concerned that reviewers will tip the solution to the murder mystery. It's that the studio wants to further the impression that the movie is full of surprises." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "Even if you think you know what the solution is, the performances are so clever and the screenplay... is so subtle that it could well turn out that your expectations are wrong." ...|$|E

[...] She also notes that the series [...] "is more cynical than The Americans on FX and more pessimistic about human nature than The Walking Dead on AMC". However, The Americans [...] "is more complex and inventive" [...] according to Stanley who concurs that season 2 is darker but notes it is more compelling than season 1. [...] Stuever compares the show unfavorably to both Veep for its [...] "bumbling chaos and ego implosions" [...] over House of Cards [...] "prohibitively sinister" [...] execution and The Good Wife for its superior delivery of [...] "nastiness and self-interest in power plays".|$|E

There are assassinations of opponents and forced displacements inflicted on the general population by all the forces involved in the Colombian Armed Conflict that makes the belligerence status claim <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept.</b> This is further complicated by the coca eradication efforts of the Colombian government that involve US support and have led to the declaration of the FARC being a terrorist organization by the United States government and the European Union.|$|R
500|$|Almost concurrently, he {{presented}} {{a project of}} electoral reform that was also vehemently opposed by the saquaremas. Historian Jeffrey D. Needell states that the saquaremas [...] "had seen him, {{one of their own}} chieftains, pick a cabinet of relatively weak men, men he could dominate. They saw an explicit attack on party government and party deals, using patronage alone to secure support. They saw that the loyalty of the ministers was principally toward Paraná, the Emperor, and a non-partisan approach to patronage (which ipso facto, undercut their party and strengthened the cabinet)." [...] Saquaremas found it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the cabinet's aid being diverted—in an attempt to secure more support for cabinet initiatives—from themselves to Liberal candidates in provincial and general elections.|$|R
500|$|Ross (David Schwimmer) and Carol (Jane Sibbett) {{inform the}} others that their son Ben (Jack and Charlie Allen) has an {{audition}} for a soup commercial, which Joey (Matt LeBlanc) finds <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept.</b> When he learns that the TV commercial also has a part for the father, he volunteers himself for the audition. Both Joey and Ben are chosen for the callback but a lack of similarity in looks makes the director cast them with different individuals, therefore ensuring {{only one of them}} can be chosen for the commercial. Joey is paired up with a famous child actor. He talks to Ross about the callback in an attempt to make Ben back out of the audition which Ross finds unreasonable as it was Ben's audition in the first place, and Joey just invited himself along. Both end up fighting over it, which drags on until the callback is held. Joey messes up his two-word line: [...] "mmm soup", ultimately losing him the part. Ross consoles him, informing him later that Ben also didn't get the part.|$|E
