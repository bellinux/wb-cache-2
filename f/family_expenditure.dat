This research involved 300 families that were selected randomly. Data collected by observation and interview. Psychosocial stimulation were measured by using the HOME instrument, while social emotional development were determined by using Vineland Social Maturity Scale instrument. Data was analyzed by descriptive and correlation analysis. Results showed that psychosocial stimulations were categorized as low. Childrens social emotional development correlated significant with mother’s education level, children’s age, <b>family’s</b> <b>expenditures,</b> and psychosocial stimulation. Psychosocial stimulation was the most associated factor to the children’s social-emotional developments. Therefore, psychosocial stimulations was very important aspect to be improved.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of cold weather periods on family budgets and on {{nutritional}} outcomes in poor American <b>families.</b> <b>Expenditures</b> on food and home fuels are tracked by linking the Consumer Expenditure Survey to temperature data. Using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we track calorie consumption, dietary quality, vitamin deficiencies, and anemia in summer and winter months. We find that both rich and poor <b>families</b> increase fuel <b>expenditures</b> in response to unusually cold weather (a 10 degree F drop below normal). At same time, poor <b>families</b> reduce food <b>expenditures</b> by roughly the same amount as the increase in fuel <b>expenditures,</b> while rich <b>families</b> increase food <b>expenditures.</b> Poor adults and children reduce caloric intake by roughly 200 calories during winter months, unlike richer adults and children. In sensitivity analyses, we find that decreases in food expenditure are most pronounced outside the South. We conclude that poor parents and their children outside the South spend and eat less food during cold weather temperature shocks. We surmise that existing social programs fail to buffer against these shocks. ...|$|R

Priority services for disabled people and the elderly were cut in a large number of areas while the number of discretionary LEA discretionary grants fell during Labour’s latter period in office. While eligibility limits for free school meals had been made more generous, a 1977 price increase resulted in a fall of over 500,000 in the number of children eating school dinners and a rise of about 170,000 in the numbers eligible for free meals but not actually receiving them.|$|E
5000|$|Bowley {{produced}} {{a stream of}} studies of British economic statistics, beginning in the 1890s with work on trade and on wages and income, and proceeding to studies of national income in the 1920s and -30s. Specially noteworthy was his collaboration with Josiah Stamp on {{a comparison of the}} UK national income in 1911 and 1924. (Official national income statistics date only from the Second World War.) From around 1910 Bowley worked on social statistics as well. In aim, the work was a continuation of such surveys of social conditions as Charles Booth's [...] "Life and Labour of the People in London" [...] (1889-1903) and Seebohm Rowntree's [...] "Poverty, A Study of Town Life" [...] (1901). The methodological innovation was the use of sampling techniques. Bowley gave a detailed exposition of his approach to sampling in a 62-page paper published in 1926. The culmination of Bowley's work on social surveys was the monumental New Survey of London Life and Labour. Even in the 1930s his research could take a new direction, as when he collaborated with his junior colleague R. G. D. Allen on an econometric study of <b>family</b> <b>expenditure.</b>|$|E

40|$|This work {{studies the}} {{association}} between welfare reform, broadly defined to include an array of social policy changes affecting low‐income families in the 1990 s, and expenditure patterns of poor single‐mother families.

However, patterns of expenditure changed. The reform policy is associated {{with an increase in}} spending on transportation and food away from home, as well as on adult clothing and footwear. In contrast, it is not related to changes in expenditures on child care or learning and enrichment activities. The pattern of results suggests that welfare reform has shifted <b>family</b> <b>expenditures</b> toward items that facilitate work outside the home but, at least so far, does not allow low‐income families to catch up with more advantaged <b>families</b> in <b>expenditures</b> on learning and enrichment...|$|R
