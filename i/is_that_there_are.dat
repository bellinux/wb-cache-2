5|$|Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir (Out of {{the depths}} I call, Lord, to You), , is a church cantata by the German {{composer}} Johann Sebastian Bach. It was composed in either 1707 or 1708, {{which makes it}} one of Bach's earliest cantatas. Some sources suggest {{that it could be}} his earliest surviving work in this form, but current thinking <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> one or two earlier examples.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{important}} mathematical applications of mirror symmetry belong to the branch of mathematics called enumerative geometry. In enumerative geometry, one is interested in {{counting the number of}} solutions to geometric questions, typically using the techniques of algebraic geometry. One of the earliest problems of enumerative geometry was posed around the year 200 BCE by the ancient Greek mathematician Apollonius, who asked how many circles in the plane are tangent to three given circles. In general, the {{solution to the problem of}} Apollonius <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> eight such circles.|$|E
5|$|The more {{commonly}} spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The {{total number of}} languages {{in the world is}} not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> between 6,000 and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100. The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the crucial}} points <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> several {{different}} sources for the Battle itself, including poems and songs in Old English, Old Norse, Old Welsh, Middle English, Latin, and Anglo-Norman, highlighting a wide potential of sources in order to glean information about the battle from {{all sides of the}} campaign. Furthermore, while these sources might be seen as biased due to national origin and underlying romantic and heroic narrative constructions of the battle for each side, some of the sources, such as the Chronicle work as points of reference to the more lyrical constructions presented in other popular narrative formats. Although there is a relative lack of iron-clad primary sources that are completely unbiased, by taking into account all of these sources, historians and literary scholars can gain a fuller image of the military maneuvers and actions taken by the respective leaders of armies involved in this battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{countries}} {{surrounding the}} gulf have been actively monitoring the seismicity there since the 1980s and {{have found a}} consistent low level of activity, but a primary characteristic of the activity <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> multiple sequences of earthquake swarms. Three swarm events, beginning {{in the north and}} ending in the south gulf, have been observed beginning in 1983 when more than 1,000 events occurred over a three-month period near the northeastern boundary of the Elat Deep (in the northern gulf) with the largest three events approaching 5 on the Richter magnitude scale. A less pronounced swarm occurred in 1990 with the largest event reaching 4.3 in the central gulf near the Elat Deep and the Arogonese Deep. The last significant swarm happened in 1993 in the southwestern Arogonese Deep (in the southern gulf) with the highest magnitude of 6.1 and more than 300 larger than magnitude 3 in the following weeks.|$|E

25|$|Also of note <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{many more}} people who {{identify}} as UU on surveys than those who attend UU churches (by a factor of four in a recent survey), reflecting those who have never joined (and lapsed members) but nonetheless consider themselves part of the UU movement.|$|E
25|$|Little {{evidence}} supports the claimed effectiveness of zero-tolerance policies.

25|$|One {{problem with}} the idea of large lakes in Valles Marineris <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no evident sources for the huge amount of water that would be required.

25|$|The {{traditional}} view of male orgasm <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two stages: emission following orgasm, {{almost instantly}} {{followed by a}} refractory period. In 1966, Masters and Johnson published pivotal research about the phases of sexual stimulation. Their work included women and men, and, unlike Alfred Kinsey in 1948 and 1953, tried to determine the physiological stages before and after orgasm.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{theories}} {{about how this}} happens. One theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> geomagnetic and chemical cues which the salmon use to guide {{them back to their}} birthplace. The fish may be sensitive to the Earth's magnetic field, which could allow the fish to orient itself in the ocean, so it can navigate back to the estuary of its natal stream.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{mechanisms}} by which the queen is recognized by her colony are not fully understood.

A potential queen who is acting aggressively can be experimentally subdued by applying the old queen's Dufour's gland's chemicals to the nest.|$|E

25|$|To complicate matters, {{there were}} several ships with the name San Juan – at least nine of them.
