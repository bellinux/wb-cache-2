At the locations detected in the scan, application of the three bootstrap-based estimators substantially reduced the upward selection bias in <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> estimation for both true and false positives.

Laminar flow also has <b>genetic</b> <b>effects,</b> such as reducing apoptosis, inhibiting proliferation, aligning cells in direction of flow, and regulating many cell signalling factors.

40|$|For {{the past}} a few years, the genomewide {{association}} studies (GWAS) have rapidly grown in scale and complexity, and have provided {{new insights into}} complex disease genetics. For loci identified by GWAS, investigators are often interested in estimating the <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> size to help understand the genetic contribution of these loci to the disease risk or trait variation. However, estimates of the <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> size based on initial GWAS sample(s) tend to be upwardly biased {{as a consequence of}} “winner’s curse”. Overestimation of <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> size in initial studies may cause follow-up studies to be underpowered and so to fail. In Chapter 2 of this dissertation, I quantify the impact of the winner’s curse for one- and two-stage case-control association studies. I then propose an ascertainment-corrected maximum likelihood method to reduce the bias and so achieve more accurate estimation of <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> size. I show that overestimation of the <b>genetic</b> <b>effect</b> by the uncorrected estimator decreases as the power of the association study increases and that the ascertainment-corrected method reduces bias when power to detect association is low to moderate as expected for GWAS for complex disease. In Chapter 3, I extend this study to quantitative trait association studies and show that the results are similar to case-control association studies. Following GWAS, testing for association between gene expression and identified SNPs has the potential to help understand the relationship between these SNPs with the trait, and identify the gene(s) and variants most likely to influence the trait. In Chapter 4, I describe five testing procedures for using the allelic expression imbalance (AEI) to detect cis-acting regulatory SNPs (rSNP), focusing on the situation when the rSNP and a transcribed SNP (tSNP) are in incomplete linkage disequilibrium (LD) and there is no phase information. My simulations show that the type I error rates for all tests are well controlled, and the relative rankings of the tests depend on the LD between the two SNPs, AEI effect size of the rSNP, sample size, and allele frequencies of the SNPs...|$|R

[...] There are small variations in the individual nucleotides of the genomes (SNPs) {{as well as many}} larger variations, such as deletions, insertions and copy number variations. Any of these may cause alterations in an individual's traits, or phenotype, which can be anything from disease risk to physical properties such as height. Around the year 2000, prior to the introduction of GWA studies, the primary method of investigation was through inheritance studies of genetic linkage in families. This approach had proven highly useful towards single gene disorders. However, for common and complex diseases the results of genetic linkage studies proved hard to reproduce. A suggested alternative to linkage studies was the genetic association study. This study type asks if the allele of a genetic variant is found more often than expected in individuals with the phenotype of interest (e.g. with the disease being studied).
