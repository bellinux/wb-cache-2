40|$|The second {{generation}} of terrestrial digital video broadcasting standard (DVB-T 2) offers several advantages for greater efficiency. Signal Space Diversity (SSD) contains rotated constellation and Q-Delay (RQD), {{which is one of}} advantage that offered to improve the performance over fading channels compared to the non-rotated modulation. In this journal, the proposed low-power <b>de-mapper</b> design of this work attempts to employ the introduced SSD to reduce power through replacing LLR calculations by a significantly less complex projectionbased de-mapping whenever possible. It benefits from an algorithm that applies projection-based de-mapping to significantly reduce LLR computations without deteriorating performance. Two versions are introduced for hard de-mapping and soft de-mapping. The design uses several techniques simultaneously to be even more energy efficient without affecting the performance. Prototype results indicate significant reduction of LLR calculations as Eb/N 0 increases with no performance degradation. The idea and energy saving techniques can be easily applied to any rotated constellation <b>de-mapper...</b>|$|E
40|$|Since BICM-ID is a {{concatenation}} between {{channel coding}} and mapping, its performances strongly {{depend on the}} matching between mapping rule and code structure. In our previous papers, we proposed a yet very simple, close Shannon limit achieving BICM-ID system. It uses very simple codes, irregular repetition and single parity check codes, combined with extended mapping. Even though {{we know that the}} key role played towards the optimal design of the proposed code is the degree allocation for variable nodes, the irregular degree allocation to the node degrees were determined only empirically, by try-anderror. This paper shows that the problem of the optimal degree allocation for the proposed BICM-ID technique can be solved by using linear programming technique. Results shows we can achieve better matching between the <b>de-mapper</b> and decoder curves, by which we can achieve even closer threshold to the Shannon limit and also lower error floor...|$|E
30|$|The fourth part {{includes}} the carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation {{obtained by the}} JWLS estimator as mentioned in Section 2. This part is also responsible for the channel estimation and the demodulation and decoding of the received data. Taking advantage of the scattered pilots contained in preamble 3 of the neighborhood discovery packets, accurate channel state information (CSI) can be acquired using the shifted raised cosine interpolator [14]. The CSI is then {{used to calculate the}} receive beamforming vector by the maximum ratio combining method. Finally, {{with the help of the}} receive beamforming vector and the estimated CSI, the four spatial streams received by the four receive antennas are combined into one data stream, which then passes through the one-tap equalizer, <b>de-mapper,</b> de-interleaver, Viterbi decoder, and de-scrambler to recover the transmitted bits. The receiver also estimates the noise power from the CSI and the correctly received symbols, which are then used to calculate the equivalent SINR.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Here an {{energy-efficient}} {{approach is}} presented for constellation shaping of a bit-interleaved low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded amplitude phase-shift keying (APSK) system. APSK is a modulation consisting of several concentric rings of signals, with each ring containing signals that {{are separated by}} a constant phase offset. APSK offers an attractive combination of spectral and energy efficiency, and is well suited for the nonlinear channels. A subset of the interleaved bits output by a binary LDPC encoder is passed through a nonlinear shaping encoder. An iterative decoder shares information among the LDPC decoder, APSK <b>de-mapper,</b> and shaping decoder. Information rates are computed for a discrete set of APSK ring radii and shaping bit probabilities, and here the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is considered. In this paper, an adaptive equalizer is added in the iterative decoding path and its purpose is to reduce inter symbol interference to allow recovery of the transmit symbol. An adaptive equalizer one that automatically adapts to time-varying properties of the communication channel. The combination of shaping, use of LDPC codes, iterative decoding and with adaptive equalizer we can achieve a gain in excess of 1. 18 dB in AWGN compared with a system that does not use shaping, uses an un optimized code from the DVB-S 2 standard, and does not iterate between decoder and demodulator...|$|E
40|$|The {{driving force}} {{of the study is}} {{susceptibility}} of LS algorithm to noise. As LS algorithm is simple to implement, hence it’s performance improvement can contribute a lot to the wireless technology that are especially deals with high computation. Cascading of AdaBoost algorithm with LS greatly influences the OFDM system performance. Performance of Adaptive Boosting based symbol recovery was investigated on the performance of LS, MMSE, BLUE were also compared with the performance of AdaBoost algorithm and MMSE has been found the higher computational complexity. Furthermore, MMSE also requires apriori channel statistics and computational complexity O(5 N 3) of the MMSE increases exponentially as the number of carrier increases. For the Adaboost case the computational complexity calculation is little different. Therefore, in the training stage of the AdaBoost algorithm, the computational complexity is only O(nT M) Furthermore, as it is a classification algorithm so in the receiver side we will require a separate <b>de-mapper</b> (or decoder) to get the desired data bits, i. e., a. SAS aided DCT based PAPR reduction 1326 and b. SAS aided DCT based PAPR reduction. A successive addition subtraction preprocessed DCT based PAPR reduction technique was proposed. Here, the performance of proposed method was compared with other preexisting techniques like SLM and PTS and the performance of the proposed method was seen to outperform specially in low PAPR region. In the proposed PAPR reduction method, the receiver is aware of the transmitted signal processing, this enables a reverse operation at the receiver to extract the transmit data. Hence the requirement of sending extra information through extra subcarrier is eliminated. The proposed method is also seen to be spectrally efficient. In the case of PTS and SLM it is inevitable to send the side information to retrieve the transmit signal. Hence, these two methods are spectrally inefficient. Successive addition subtraction based PAPR reduction method was also applied to MIMO systems. The performance of the SAS based PAPR reduction method also showed better performance as compared to other technique. An extensive simulation of MIMO OFDM PAPR reduction was carried out by varying the number of subcarriers and number of transmitter antennas. A detailed computational complexity analysis was also carried out. BATE aided SDMA multi user detection. A detailed study of SDMA system was carried out with it’s mathematical analysis. Many linear and non linear detectors like ML, MMSE, PIC, SIC have been proposed in literature for multiuser detection of SDMA system. However, except MMSE every receivers other are computational extensive. So as to enhance the performance of the MMSE MUD a meta heuristic Bat algorithm was incorporated in cascade with MMSE...|$|E
