5000|$|<b>Transplant</b> <b>coordinator</b> is a {{healthcare}} professional - doctor, nurse, allied health science graduate, or a {{medical social worker}} - who coordinates activities related to organ donation and transplantation. <b>Transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> can either be Donor Coordinators or Recipient Coordinators.|$|R
30|$|Because donors can be {{enrolled}} {{at any of}} the 175 hospitals served by the CTDN, the study activities are performed primarily by the <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> who are at the bedside from before enrollment until after organ procurement. CTDN <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> arrange for the study drug to be administered by the hospital respiratory therapist, draw blood samples, and record study data. <b>Transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> are a heterogeneous group with different backgrounds (nursing, respiratory therapy, emergency medical services), training, and experience and typically have no formal training in human research. All CTDN <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> were trained extensively in the study procedures before the study launch and refresher training is done frequently. Study data are reviewed by the principal investigator as they accrue, and all protocol violations are immediately reported to the CTDN study coordinator who contacts the respective <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinator</b> to discuss the protocol violation and provide additional training.|$|R

40|$|The {{transplantation}} {{of organs}} and tissues comprised the highlight invention of great {{utility of the}} medicine for the twentieth century. The institution of the <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinator</b> contributed {{to the rise of}} disposable grafts in Greece. From 1997 onwards begins the rise of the disposable graft but this didn’t last for a long time. Contrarily noted that grafts’ number decreased considerably. The aim of this study was the measurement of behavior of <b>Transplant</b> <b>Coordinator</b> in a Intensive Care Unit of General Hospital of Crete. Methodology: For the measurement of behavior of <b>Transplant</b> <b>Coordinator</b> was used as a tool a questionnaire structured in three parts. The sample consisted of 30 nurses that worked in the Intensive Care Unit of hospital. Results: From the nurses that answered the 93 % knew about the institution and the role of <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinator</b> and the 90 % knew who the <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinator</b> in the hospital was. The 60 % of the nurses support that the institution of <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinator</b> contributed in the increase of transplantation. Moreover, the 44 % supports that the <b>transplant</b> <b>Coordinator</b> should be a team composed of nurse, doctor and psychologist. The 60 % of the nurses reports that many patients were lost which were the right donors because of the <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinator’s</b> delinquency to find donors. It must be noted that nurses who were asked the 80 % answered that they had participated in the procedure of transplantation because of Coordinator’s absence. The biggest percent 55 % reports that the coordinator has no interest in transplant’s coordination, the 39 % answered “I don’t know” and the 6 % that the coordinator has many responsibilities. Finally, they evaluate and attach importance to the policies reported in the role of <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinator</b> that would contribute in the increase of transplantation in Greece: education of coordinators, postgraduate title of “coordinator of transplantation”, personnel of ICU, evaluation of coordinators, motives in the coordinators, change coordinator each year. Conclusively: The <b>Transplant</b> <b>Coordinator’s</b> transfers his duties and responsibilities in the nurses of the Intensive Care Unit. Nurses assume the responsibility for the organization of transplant procedure whereas they have never been trained. That means that it will be more easy to be lost patients which were the right donors for transplantation...|$|R
40|$|Organ {{transplantation}} {{holds the}} promise of new life or better life for thousands of Americans every year. Transplantation involves a process that stretches over time beginning at referral, moving to transplantation and long term care. The <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinator</b> is considered {{an integral part of}} this care. <b>Transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> are considered so important to the care of these patients that transplant centers are required to have at least one <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinator</b> by federal regulations. The role of the <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinator,</b> however, is not well defined. Although many of the role dimensions attributed to <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> are consistent with nursing practice, the role has not been clearly identified as being exclusively within the domain of nursing. Research regarding the role is scarce, particularly research identifying the value of the role in promoting patient outcomes. Most glaringly absent are reports of the patients’ experience with <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> and their expectations of the coordinator. This gap in knowledge effectively silences the voice of the patient in defining the role and limits the ability to define the role using a patient-centered approach. Twelve kidney transplant recipients who received transplants at eight different transplant centers were interviewed. The participants were interviewed about their experiences and interactions with <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators.</b> The data from these interviews were conceptualized as a Basic Social Process. Using classic grounded theory methodology, the data from these interviews were analyzed. The resultant theory was Easing My Burden. The theory explains that, for the participants, end stage renal disease represented a Basic Social Psychological Problem. The Basic Social Process between the patient and the <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators,</b> if successful, resulted {{in the development of a}} trusting relationship which in turn, eased the patient’s psychological burden of end-stage renal failure. Findings of this study offer previously unpublished insight into the relationship between transplant recipients and their <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators.</b> The results are useful in public policy, nursing practice, and management as well as suggesting future research...|$|R

Poor communication and cooperation between <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> and intensive care nursing staff can lead to the non-referral of potential organ donors, which is detrimental to the process. The purpose of the research is to ascertain the attitude and knowledge of the <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> and intensive care nursing staff who work in intensive care units during organ donation and to draw up guidelines for the improvement of communication and cooperation between them. Contextual descriptive research was done by compiling literature based questionnaires, one each for the <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> and intensive care nursing staff and then analysing responses. The indications are that problem areas exist between the role players in the organ transplant process. This results in the insufficient referrals from intensive care units which are detrimental to the organ donation process. From this research, the following guidelines can be drawn up to promote organ donation: To provide a policy manual regarding organ donation for every intensive care unit. The respective roles of the <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinator</b> and intensive care nursing staff in the organ donation process must be clarified. Awareness campaigns should be held to promote organ donation. Feedback should be given by <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> and intensive care nursing staff regarding transplant occurrences.

30|$|Having the {{healthcare}} team {{raise the issue}} of organ donation ensures continuity of the relationship with the family and facilitates the intervention of the <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinator</b> team, which occurs immediately afterward, particularly when the family spontaneously brings up the possibility of organ donation. A potential disadvantage, however, is that the family may become unsure or even suspicious about the legitimacy of the treatment-withdrawal decision. On the other hand, in theory, having the issue raised by the <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinator</b> team in the presence of {{the healthcare}} team may underline the independence of the treatment-withdrawal decision from a desire to enable organ retrieval but also may raise questions in the minds of the family members.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} and explore issues and challenges that impact on <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> and their practice. Such identification enhances understanding of their role, provides evidence for decision-makers to facilitate the positive aspects of the coordinators' practice, highlights their professional needs and contributions and provides baseline data for future research, education and policy development. The study used both qualitative and quantitative data. Data collection methods involved focus group interviews and Delphi surveys. Participants were coordinators who were employed on a full-time, part-time or relieving basis. Recruitment of participants was done by purposive and snowball sampling. There were 112 coordinators in the study and each was randomly assigned to the focus groups or Delphi survey phases of the research. The analysis of the focus group data together with the literature, informed the development of the first Delphi survey. The second Delphi survey was developed using the data from the focus groups, literature and the first survey. Four categories emerged from the data. The first involved 'knowledge and experience', which explored the education needs of coordinators and the issue of nursing qualification requirements. The work environment, demands and conditions, together with role attributes were discussed in the next category - 'the role'. Recipient, donor family and <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinator</b> outcomes were addressed in the 'outcomes’ category. The basic social process – building relationships - explored the relationships that coordinators have with the health team and their client groups. Four types of relationships emerged which were supportive, non-supportive, aggressive and virtual relationships. The emergent theory of the challenges that <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> face relates to the building of relationships. The theory also discovers how knowledge and experience, the role and outcomes impact on the building of these relationships in an interdependent manner. This study also emphasises that the transplant coordinators' role is complex, demanding and distinctly unique in terms of the context within which coordinators practice. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Background: Organ {{transplantation}} {{is getting}} more important and the demand increased exponentially in the past decade. However, due to the shortage of organ supply, some people died while waiting for an organ and the other may rely on all forms of organ support to live. Hong Kong has the lowest organ donation rate among the developed world despite large-scale organ donation enhancement activities implemented for decade. Since consent from family members is mandatory, {{it is important to}} understand the reasons relatives given for consenting or refusing to donation. Objectives: (1) To investigate the change of attitudes towards organ donation in Hong Kong during 2004 to 2012. (2) To understand the difficulties of <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> encountered during counseling Methods: This is a cross-sectional survey looking at the recent change of reasons of the families of the potential donors to make decision about donation. <b>Transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> of all 7 clusters completed questionnaires after counseling each potential donor referred during the 7 months study period. Demographic data and reasons of refusal or consent of donation were recorded and analyzed and compared with previous results. Difficulties of <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> encountered during counseling were recorded. Results: Totally 52 questionnaires were completed within 7 months. The conversion rate were similar when compared to that in 2004 (44. 3 % in 2004 vs 40 % in 2012). The proportion of older potential donor in the refusal group is higher than that of consent group (> 60 years old 51. 6 % vs 38 %,). The demographic data was neither statistical significantly different between consent and refusal group nor correlated with refusal of donation. From 2004 to this survey, the most common reason to refusal remained to be the traditional belief of buried intact. Both were 33 %. The “expressed wish of the deceased to object donation while alive” increased from 13 % in 2004 to 20 % in 2012 (p= 0. 378), and “no consensus from family” dropped from 26 % in 2004 to 11 % in 2012 (p= 0. 083). The reason “no expression of any wish” remained static when compared to that in 2004 (15 % vs 16 %, p= 0. 982). The reason for consenting to donation changed a lot. Although the most common reason remained the “wish to help others” (94 % vs 41 %, p< 0. 0001), the second and third reason changed to “feeling good by being charitable” (21 % vs 0 %, p= 0. 0071) and “not to waste useful organs” (18 % vs 3 %, p= 0. 0455) while the fourth reason was “respect deceased’s choice”(14 % vs 0 %, p= 0. 0278). The reasons of refusal and consenting donation are explained in the context of the decision-making process. The main obstacles the <b>transplant</b> <b>coordinators</b> have encountered were knowledge gap, emotion, time pressure and family or social disharmony. Conclusion: The major reasons for consenting and refusing donation did not only change in position but also change in proportion in last decade. The importance of some reasons increased significantly and strategies to improve conversion rate should be adjusted according to the changing reasons. Education to change the traditional belief, encourage expression of donation wish, create position image of donation and the benefit of transplant are all important. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R
