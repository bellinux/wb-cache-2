25|$|While {{design of}} the car was proceeding, Hayek feared {{existing}} manufacturers would <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> the Swatchmobile. Thus, rather than directly competing, he preferred to cooperate with another company in the automotive industry. This would also relieve SMH of the cost burden in setting up a distribution network. Hayek approached several automotive manufacturers and on July 3, 1991, he reached an agreement with Volkswagen to share development of the new project.|$|E

25|$|Since {{it was not}} {{possible}} for only Manchus to conquer southern China, Ming Han Chinese armies conquered the territory for them. Three Liaodong Han Bannermen officers who played a great role in the conquest of southern China were Shang Kexi, Geng Zhongming, and Kong Youde, who then governed southern China autonomously as viceroys for the Qing. Wu, Geng, and Shang's son, Shang Zhixin, in the early 1660s began to <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> the increasing control from the north, and decided they {{had no choice but to}} revolt. The ensuing Revolt of the Three Feudatories lasted for eight years. At the peak of the rebels' fortunes, they extended their control as far north as the Yangtze River, nearly establishing a divided China. Wu then hesitated to go further north, not being able to coordinate strategy with his allies, and Emperor Kangxi was able to unify his forces for a counterattack led by a new generation of Manchu generals. By 1681, the Qing government had established control over a ravaged southern China from which it took several decades to recover.|$|E
500|$|Men may <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> the earning {{potential}} and independence {{of women and}} react violently to shift the gender power structure back in their favour. [...] One of the largest factors associated with domestic violence against women was the prevalence of alcohol use by men within the households. A 2005 study conducted by Pradeep Panda and Bina Agarwal found {{that the incidence of}} domestic violence against women dropped dramatically with women's ownership of immovable property, which includes land and housing.|$|E
500|$|The game's world {{design and}} {{atmosphere}} received great critical reviews. Many critics {{agreed that the}} game had successfully built up tension through the game's conversations between characters and the resource management mechanics, which enables players to <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> {{the state of the}} world. The world was thought to be more [...] "alive" [...] than its predecessor, and critics praised the development team for creating distinct locations, and turning typical gritty colors featured in many games into something refreshing and stunning. The depiction of the world and 4A's vision of an apocalypse was applauded for delivering a sense of sadness and desperation. The game's attention to detail was widely praised, and the surface area, in particular, was applauded. Critics thought that these sequences offered visual variety, and some [...] "genuine terror" [...] moments. Jim Sterling from Destructoid singled out the game's multiple flashback scenes, which he described as [...] "harrowing".|$|E

500|$|Racism, an {{important}} theme {{in all of}} Angelou's autobiographies, continues {{to be important in}} this book, but she has matured in the way she deals with it in Traveling Shoes. [...] For the first time in Angelou's life, she [...] "does not <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> racial hate" [...] in Ghana. [...] She finds a strong support system there, and as Hagen states, she [...] "has come far from the mute, shy little girl of Stamps, Arkansas". [...] As Hagen states, Angelou [...] "is not yet ready to toss off the stings of prejudice, but tolerance and even a certain understanding can be glimpsed". [...] This is demonstrated in Angelou's treatment of the [...] "genocidal involvement of Africans in slave-trading", something that is often overlooked or misrepresented by other Black writers. [...] Angelou is taught {{an important}} lesson about combating racism by Malcolm X, who compares it to a mountain in which everyone's efforts, even the efforts of Shirley Graham DuBois, whom Angelou resents, is needed.|$|E
500|$|The Joker's unpredictable, homicidal nature {{makes him}} one of the most feared supervillains in the DC Universe; the Trickster says in the 2005 mini-series Underworld Unleashed, [...] "When super-villains want to scare each other, they tell Joker stories". Gotham's villains also <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> the character; {{depending}} on the circumstances, he is as likely to fight with his rivals for control of the city as he is to join them for an entertaining outcome. The Joker interacts with other supervillains who oppose Batman, whether he is on the streets or in Arkham Asylum. He has collaborated with criminals like the Penguin, the Riddler and Two-Face, although these partnerships rarely end well due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos, and uses his stature to lead others (such as Killer Croc and the Scarecrow). The Joker's greatest rival is the smartest man in the world, Lex Luthor. Although they have a friendly partnership in 1950's World's Finest Comics #88, later unions emphasized their mutual hostility and clashing egos.|$|E
500|$|Suryakanth's {{younger brother}} Ramakanth (Tusshar Kapoor) is {{an admirer of}} Silk and starts to befriend her. Silk {{develops}} a liking for him, after she realizes {{that he is the}} first man who loves her for more than just her body and sex appeal. At an awards ceremony Silk is praised for her performance but is insulted by Suryakanth who tells her that she is nothing more than everyone's [...] "dirty secret". Hurt by his remarks, Silk announces that she will continue to make her [...] "dirty pictures" [...] and that she has no qualms in doing so. She begins {{to spend more time with}} Ramakanth and becomes the focus of tabloid gossip after noted journalist Naila (Anju Mahendru) criticises Silk for having a romantic relationship with both brothers. To avoid scandal, and also to get revenge, Suryakanth drops Silk from his forthcoming films, forcing her to work with smaller, unknown filmmakers.

2500|$|In its {{founding}} statement, the ATU Network published a tariff of membership {{fees for the}} various grades of union employee, maximum £10/month. However the nominal fee for lay members of ATU is only £1/year.

2500|$|In 2004, Philip Gordon {{stated that}} [...] "a clear {{majority}} of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives, while believing the European Union {{can help them}} take advantage of globalization's benefits while shielding them from its negative effects." [...] The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists. Residents of the EU {{did not appear to}} <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> globalization in 2004. The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts. Social spending was much higher than in the US. In a Danish poll in 2007, 76% responded that globalization is a good thing.|$|E
2500|$|The Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights {{also said}} that, [...] "Documenting the protests {{has been a}} {{challenge}} {{for members of the}} media and NGO's as the government has stifled the flow of information" [...] and that [...] "Journalists have been threatened and arrested, and had their equipment confiscated or had materials erased from their equipment." [...] Those reporting the protests <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> President Maduro who has created [...] "an increasingly asphyxiating climate" [...] for them. Television stations in Venezuela have hardly displayed live coverage of protests and had resulted in many opposition viewers moving to CNN in 2014.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aftermath}} of the Bay of Pigs invasion and events involving Cuba that followed caused the US to <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> their neighbor. [...] Previous to the events at Playa Girón the US government imposed embargoes that limited trade with Cuba. An article that appeared in The New York Times on 6 January 1960 called trade with Cuba [...] "too risky" [...] and about six months later in July 1960, the US reduced the import quota of Cuban sugar, which left the US to increase its sugar supply using other sources. Just following the Bay of Pigs invasion the Kennedy Administration considered complete trade restrictions with Cuba. Five months later the president was authorized to do so. After Cuba’s declaration of Marxism, the Kennedy administration imposed a complete trade embargo against Cuba. After the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 the Kennedy Administration imposed strict travel restrictions for U.S. citizens.|$|E
2500|$|Cecil {{had since}} {{been fascinated by}} the Gnostic Gospels; in 1945, a local farmer near Nag Hammadi, Upper Egypt {{discovered}} a clay casket with twelve leather-bound manuscripts that comprised fifty-two Gnostic texts; one of the texts particularly caught Cecil's attention, the Testimony of Truth, which {{tells the story of}} Genesis from a different perspective: From the perspective of a jealous God, the creator of man, and the Serpent, Lucifer, the bringer of light, who gives knowledge to man but is not once called the Devil – these were written by Gnostics, who were considered heretic by the Orthodox Church; the Cathars, who were Gnostic, [...] were brutally suppressed and massacred during the 13th century in the Albigensian Crusade in Languedoc, Southern France, by Pope Innocent III of the Catholic Church and the newly-set up Dominican Order.

2500|$|Despite an {{agreement}} between the National Union of Mineworkers and the mine, {{a majority of the}} 3,000 striking members from the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union continued to stay away from work. NUM's General-Secretary Frans Baleni said there had been a [...] "high level of intimidation" [...] had stopped other miners from returning to work. [...] "The workers are still scared. There have been threats that those who have reported for duty would have their homes torched. Some of the workers also <b>feel</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> their managers. Peace has not really prevailed at this stage, which is the main reason why workers would stay away." [...] On 11 September, as another deadline to return to work passed, workers continued to stick their ground amid mounting solidarity protests. Following President Jacob Zuma's vow to clamp down on protests at the mine on 14 September, military convoys and other armoured vehicles were seen in the area. The next day, demonstrations turned violent after the representatives of the striking miners refused to hand in their machetes, sticks and pistols. Police then fired tear gas on the protesters in a shantytown. On 17 September, another march was stopped by police. At the same time COSATU was holding its annual congress with the issue on the top of its agenda.|$|E
