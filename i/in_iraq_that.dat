25|$|The American {{military}} proposals outlined an intensified {{effort to}} enlist tribal {{leaders in the}} frontier areas of Pakistan {{in the fight against}} al-Qaeda. The proposal was modeled in part on a similar effort by American forces <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>that</b> had been hailed as a great success in fighting foreign insurgents there. But it raised the question of whether such partnerships can be forged without a significant American military presence in Pakistan. The American military raised great questions whether it is enough support can be found among the tribes. Small numbers of high-ranking officers of American military have served as advisers to the Pakistan Armed Forces in the tribal areas, giving planning advice and helping to integrate American intelligence. Under this new approach, the number of advisers had to increase.|$|E
