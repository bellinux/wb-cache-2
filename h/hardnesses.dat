5|$|The coinage metals were {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s1 electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: p6s1; group 11: d10s1). However, the similarities are largely confined to the stoichiometries of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical properties. This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals. Furthermore, they have higher melting points, <b>hardnesses,</b> and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia, as well as having more covalent character in their compounds. Finally, the alkali metals {{are at the top}} of the electrochemical series, whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom. The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation states than +1 and a richer coordination chemistry, thus giving the group 11 metals clear transition metal character. Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it forms the auride ion (Au−) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution: here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its 5d106s1 configuration has one electron less than the quasi-closed shell 5d106s2 configuration of mercury.|$|E

The colour is that of which we are immediately aware, and the awareness itself is the sensation.

A <b>hardness</b> extractor takes in a Boolean function as input, as well as an advice string, and outputs a Boolean function defined on a smaller number of bits which has close to maximum <b>hardness.</b> We prove several positive and negative results about these objects. First, we observe that hardness-based pseudo-random generators can be used to extract deterministic <b>hardness</b> from non-deterministic <b>hardness.</b> We derive several consequences of this observation. Among other results, we show that if E has exponential non-deterministic <b>hardness,</b> then E with linear advice has close to maximum deterministic <b>hardness.</b> We demonstrate a rare downward closure result: there is δ> 0 such that E with sub-exponential advice is contained in non-uniform space 2 δn if and only if there is k> 0 such that P with quadratic advice can be approximated in non-uniform space n k. Next, we consider limitations on natural models of <b>hardness</b> condensing and extraction.
