5|$|After {{leaving the}} Army, Bachelder became a {{research}} chemist at the University of Chicago, {{where the first}} self-sustaining nuclear reaction had been achieved in 1942. Nobel Laureate James <b>Franck</b> had been Director of the Chemistry Division of the Metallurgical Laboratory during the earlier phases of the Manhattan Project. Bachelder joined the University's Institute for the Study of Metals (renamed as the James <b>Franck</b> Institute in 1967), and she conducted further research in metallochemistry.|$|E
5|$|At Berlin, <b>Franck</b> {{attended}} lectures by Max Planck and Emil Warburg. On 28 July 1904 {{he saved}} {{a pair of}} children from drowning in the Spree River. For his Doctor of Philosophy (Dir. Phil.) under Warburg's supervision, Warburg suggested that he study corona discharges. <b>Franck</b> found this topic too complex, so he changed the focus of his thesis. Entitled Über der Beweglichkeit Ladungsträger der Spitzenentladung ("On the Mobility of Ions"), it would subsequently {{be published in the}} Annalen der Physik.|$|E
50|$|<b>Francks</b> {{was born}} in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He {{is the son of}} actor and {{musician}} Don <b>Francks</b> and dancer Lili <b>Francks,</b> a member of the Plains Cree First Nation. He is also the younger brother of Cree Summer.|$|R
50|$|Don <b>Francks</b> {{was born}} on 28 February 1932 and shortly after his birth was adopted. Francks's mother worked at a music store and his father was an electrician. As a child <b>Francks</b> {{performed}} on Vancouver radio doing imitations of singers. After dropping {{out of high school}} at age 15, <b>Francks</b> worked several jobs. In 1955 he received his major break, winning a regular part on the CBC Television programme Burns Chuckwagon from the Stampede Corral. After guest appearances on several other television shows throughout the late 1950s, <b>Francks</b> received his first lead part in the 1959-60 CBC programme R.C.M.P., playing Constable Bill Mitchell.|$|R
50|$|At the Purple Onion is a live album by guitarist Lenny Breau with Don <b>Francks</b> and Eon Henstridge, {{recorded}} in 1962 and released in 2004. Breau, <b>Francks</b> and Henstridge performed as a trio called Three.|$|R
5|$|Between 1845 and 1847, Belgian-French {{composer}} César <b>Franck</b> {{wrote an}} orchestral piece based on Victor Hugo's poem Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne. The work exhibits {{characteristics of a}} symphonic poem, and some musicologists, such as Norman Demuth and Julien Tiersot, consider it {{the first of its}} genre, preceding Liszt's compositions. However, <b>Franck</b> did not publish or perform his piece; neither did he set about defining the genre. Liszt's determination to explore and promote the symphonic poem gained him recognition as the genre's inventor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Franck</b> {{participated in}} the Manhattan Project during World War II as Director of the Chemistry Division of the Metallurgical Laboratory. He was also the {{chairman}} of the Committee on Political and Social Problems regarding the atomic bomb, which is best known for the compilation of the <b>Franck</b> Report, which recommended that the atomic bombs not be used on the Japanese cities without warning.|$|E
5|$|French orchestral leader <b>Franck</b> Pourcel {{recorded}} the song for his Friends album in 1971.|$|E
5000|$|The Symphony takes <b>Franck's</b> {{concept of}} three-movement pattern with cyclic form one step further, making the form more {{dramatic}} and compressing symphonic form, a task taken to its extremes by Jean Sibelius. Harmonically it takes <b>Franck's</b> chromaticism towards something more impressionistic.|$|R
5000|$|In 1962 <b>Francks</b> married Nancy Sue Johnson. They had a son, Trane, and {{daughter}} before divorcing in 1967. While filming Finian's Rainbow <b>Francks</b> met Lili Clark, a dancer from San Francisco. After persuading her {{to travel with}} him to the Red Pheasant First Nation in Saskatchewan, the two married there in a field on 4 May 1968. Franks and Clark had a daughter, Cree Summer (born 1969), and a son, Rainbow Sun (born 1979). During the 1970s <b>Francks</b> and Clark lived at Red Pheasant. During this time the Cree chief King Bird Baptiste gave <b>Francks</b> the name Iron Buffalo, meaning [...] "someone who is strong, who knows where to go, and who provides well for his family." ...|$|R

5|$|In 1920, the University of Göttingen offered Max Born its {{chair of}} {{theoretical}} physics, which {{had recently been}} vacated by Peter Debye. Göttingen was an important centre for mathematics, thanks to David Hilbert, Felix Klein, Hermann Minkowski and Carl Runge, {{but not so much}} for physics. This would change. As part of his price for coming to Göttingen, Born wanted <b>Franck</b> to head experimental physics there. On 15 November 1920, <b>Franck</b> became Professor of Experimental Physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics, a fully tenured professor ordinarius. He was allowed two assistants, so he brought Hertha Sponer with him from Berlin to fill one of the positions. Pohl, a gifted teacher, headed the First Institute, and handled the lectures. <b>Franck</b> refurbished the laboratory with the latest equipment using funds from his own pocket.|$|E
5|$|Bachelder {{retired from}} the <b>Franck</b> Institute in 1973, and was {{subsequently}} active as {{an official of the}} American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). She died in Chicago on May 22, 1997.|$|E
5|$|<b>Franck</b> {{became the}} Head of the Physics Division of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft for Physical Chemistry. In 1920, <b>Franck</b> became {{professor}} ordinarius of experimental physics and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics at the University of Göttingen. While there {{he worked on}} quantum physics with Max Born, who was Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics. His work included the Franck–Hertz experiment, an important confirmation of the Bohr model of the atom. He promoted the careers of women in physics, notably Lise Meitner, Hertha Sponer and Hilde Levi.|$|E
50|$|The choir {{celebrated its}} 10th anniversary by {{performing}} César <b>Franck's</b> Die Sieben Worte Jesu Am Kreuz on 30 March 2013. This {{was also the}} Malaysian premiere of <b>Franck's</b> long lost sacred choral work. Cantus Musicus was accompanied by pipe organ, harp, violins, violoncello and oboe.|$|R
2500|$|Many of <b>Franck's</b> works employ [...] "cyclic form", {{a method}} {{aspiring}} to achieve unity across multiple movements. This may {{be achieved by}} reminiscence, or recall, of an earlier thematic material into a later movement, or as in <b>Franck's</b> output where all of the principal themes of the work are generated from a germinal motif. The main melodic subjects, thus interrelated, are then recapitulated in the final movement. <b>Franck's</b> use of [...] "cyclic form" [...] is best illustrated by his Symphony in D minor (1888).|$|R

5|$|In 1935, <b>Franck</b> {{moved to}} the United States, where he had {{accepted}} a professorship at Johns Hopkins University. The laboratory there was poorly equipped compared {{to the one in}} Göttingen, but he received $10,000 for equipment from the Rockefeller Foundation. A more intractable problem was that the university had no money to hire skilled staff. <b>Franck</b> was concerned about his family members remaining in Germany, and needed money to help them emigrate. He therefore accepted an offer from the University of Chicago, where his work on photosynthesis had attracted interest, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Nobel Prize. <b>Franck</b> was awarded the Max Planck Medal of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft in 1951 and the Rumford Medal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences {{for his work on}} photosynthesis in 1955. He became an honorary citizen of Göttingen in 1953, and was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1964. He died suddenly from a heart attack while visiting Göttingen on 21 May 1964, and was buried in Chicago with his first wife. In 1967, the University of Chicago named the James <b>Franck</b> Institute after him. A lunar crater has also been named in his honour. His papers are in the University of Chicago Library.|$|E
5|$|With {{his thesis}} completed, <b>Franck</b> had to perform his {{deferred}} military service. He was called up on 1 October 1906 {{and joined the}} 1st Telegraph Battalion. He suffered a minor horse riding accident in December and was discharged as unfit for duty. He took up an assistantship at the Physikalische Verein in Frankfurt in 1907, but did not enjoy it, and soon returned to Frederick William University. At a concert <b>Franck</b> met Ingrid Josephson, a Swedish pianist. They were married in a Swedish ceremony in Gothenburg on 23 December 1907. They had two daughters, Dagmar (Daggie), {{who was born in}} 1909, and Elisabeth (Lisa), who was born in 1912.|$|E

50|$|Hulda was <b>Franck's</b> first opera to be performed, in Monte Carlo, 1894. The {{influence}} of Wagner is clear, {{both in the}} writing for brass {{and also in the}} love duets which are reminiscent of Tristan und Isolde. <b>Franck's</b> writing shows his seriousness of expression and characteristic chromatic harmony.|$|R

5|$|Fauré was a {{founding}} member of the Société Nationale de Musique, formed in February 1871 under the joint chairmanship of Romain Bussine and Saint-Saëns, to promote new French music. Other members included Georges Bizet, Emmanuel Chabrier, Vincent d'Indy, Henri Duparc, César <b>Franck,</b> Édouard Lalo and Jules Massenet. Fauré became secretary of the society in 1874. Many of his works were first presented at the society's concerts.|$|E
5|$|For the 2007–08 season, Bayern made drastic squad {{changes to}} help rebuild. They signed {{a total of}} eight new players and sold, {{released}} or loaned out nine of their players. Among new signings were 2006 World Cup stars such as <b>Franck</b> Ribéry, Miroslav Klose and Luca Toni. Bayern {{went on to win}} the Bundesliga, being on top of the standings on every single week of play, and the DFB-Pokal against Borussia Dortmund.|$|E
5|$|Hibs {{enjoyed a}} good season in 2000–01 as they {{finished}} third in the league and reached the 2001 Scottish Cup Final, which was lost 3–0 to Celtic. Manager Alex McLeish departed for Rangers in December 2001; team captain <b>Franck</b> Sauzée was appointed as the new manager, {{despite the fact that he}} had no previous coaching experience. A terrible run of form followed and Sauzée was fired after being in charge for 69 days.|$|E
