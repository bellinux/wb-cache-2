In the real world, some of the already clustered documents may not be of importance while new documents of more significance may evolve. Most of the work done so far in clustering unstructured text documents overlooks this aspect of clustering. This paper, addresses this issue by using the <b>Fading</b> <b>Function.</b> The unstructured text documents are clustered. And for each cluster a statistics structure called Cluster Profile (CP) is implemented. The cluster profile incorporates the <b>Fading</b> <b>Function.</b> This <b>Fading</b> <b>Function</b> keeps an account of the time-dependent importance of the cluster.

Spectral splitting, with comb filters has helped in improving the perception of place feature. Temporal splitting, using trapezoidal <b>fading</b> <b>functions,</b> provided improvement {{in the perception of}} duration feature. Splitting of speech using time-varying comb filters, in which the bands of the comb filter are cyclically swept to have spectral and temporal splitting simultaneously, provided improvement in features of place and duration, without affecting the other features. An overall evaluation has been carried out, by conducting listening tests on seven normal hearing subjects with simulated hearing loss, on the three processing schemes: (i) spectral splitting with comb filters based on auditory critical bands designed for minimum spectral distortion and perceptual balance, (ii) temporal splitting with inter-aural switching of 20, 40, and 80 ms with trapezoidal <b>fading</b> <b>functions</b> of 70 % duty cycle and 3 ms transition, and (iii) combined spectral and temporal splitting using time-varying comb filters with sweep cycles of 20, 40, 80, 120 and 160 ms, each with 4, 8, and 16 shiftings. Test material consisted of phonetically balanced monosyllabic words in listener's native language. Hearing loss was simulated by adding broadband noise at different levels to the speech stimuli at constant short-time SNR of 10 ms. At recognition score of 60 %, spectral splitting provided an improvement of 5 dB in SNR.

Splitting the speech into segments and presenting the alternate segments to the two ears, may help in reducing the effect of increased temporal masking in cases of moderate bilateral loss. A method of inter-aural switching with a switching frequency of 50 Hz, with step and trapezoidal “fading functions ” was investigated. It {{has been established in}} our earlier work that inter-aural switching with step transition with certain overlap of segments (duty cycle of 70 %) helps in improving the perceived quality, by reducing the perception of temporal gaps. Use of trapezoidal <b>fading</b> <b>function</b> during switching may help in reducing the occurrence of high frequency components and thereby further increasing the speech intelligibility. Effect of different slopes (during trapezoidal variation) in improving the speech quality was studied. Stimuli consisted of 12 English non-sense syllables in VCV context.

30|$|With the {{intention}} of detecting novelty in the data stream, we consider each new micro-cluster which has been registered {{for the first time}} in the repository as the novel micro-cluster. In contrast, if this novel micro-cluster does not receive enough data it can be considered as the outlier. To facilitate distinguish between the novel micro-clusters and abnormalities; we will introduce a parameter which is called as outlier factor and defined by the user. This outlier can be a temporal outlier and later by merging other micro-clusters promotes to the real cluster in the next windows. For example, the first document belonging to a particular category in a document stream of current window may be recognized as an outlier, but it may later form a cluster of documents of its own by merging other micro-clusters in the next window. Due to this fact we are employing batch processing for online component, outlier and novel micro-cluster detection can be carried out easily after each time window is in the offline component. Consequently, by determining the time interval for <b>fading</b> <b>function,</b> outlier and novel micro-cluster detection is not required.|$|E

For example, {{in the domain of}} concept learning, a policy might specify the nature of exemplars chosen over a training sequence. Traditional psychological studies compare several hand-selected policies, e. g., contrasting a policy that selects only difficult-to-classify exemplars with a policy that gradually progresses over the training sequence from easy exemplars to more difficult (known as fading). We propose an alternative to the traditional methodology in which we define a parameterized space of policies and search this space to identify the optimal policy. For example, in concept learning, policies might be described by a <b>fading</b> <b>function</b> that specifies exemplar difficulty over time. We propose an experimental technique for searching policy spaces using Gaussian process surrogate-based optimization and a generative model of student performance. Instead of evaluating a few experimental conditions each with many human subjects, as the traditional methodology does, our technique evaluates many experimental conditions each with a few subjects. Even though individual subjects provide only a noisy estimate of the population mean, the optimization method allows us to determine the shape of the policy space and to identify the global optimum, and is as efficient in its subject budget as a traditional A-B comparison. We evaluate the method via two behavioral studies, and suggest that the method has broad applicability to optimization problems involving humans outside the educational arena. ...|$|E

30|$|In this study, a {{new method}} based on vector model and divide-and-conquer {{approach}} has been utilized for clustering evolving stream data. We have selected a vector model description because {{it allows us to}} model the hierarchical structure and relationships among data more accurately by which we are capable to overcome monotonous data and managing ordinal data type. Frequent split and merge provides an effective and detailed representation of any changes that may occur in the cluster over time. A key aspect of DCSTREAM is the use of dividing samples based on their length within the vector model description which allows the method to capture the general structure of the clusters without requiring the complete cluster data to be stored in memory. Most of the time there is no requirement to execute second stage of algorithm. In other words in first stage micro-clusters can be revealed. Thus, algorithm can save memory and processing time. A repository has been used to recall previously discovered micro-clusters in the presence of recurrent change to manage evolving data. For managing evolving data, a <b>fading</b> <b>function</b> with decay concept has been employed by DCSTREAM to detect expired micro-clusters. This enables the algorithm to discard the least useful micro-clusters with memory constraint consideration. The repository {{can also be used to}} obtain a historical perspective on the general hierarchical of the micro-clusters over time and to archive these changes for off-line analysis. Experimental results have demonstrated that the algorithm is able to effectively classify both synthetic and real world datasets. The algorithm was compared against implementation of ConStream and STREAM in terms of accuracy and performance using KDDCUP 99 and document datasets. The results show that DCSTREAM can achieve superior quality and performance as compare to the mentioned methods for abrupt and gradual real world datasets. Furthermore, quality and performance experiment results for KDDCUP 99 demonstrated that monotonous data which was introduced in this study was maintained by DCSTREAM efficiently.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} properties of long-term, passive radiation dosimetry systems incorporating thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) for use in diverse interior and exterior settings. In so doing, a multitude of factors affecting thermoluminescence calibrations and measurements were examined. TLD calibration precision was studied, including the time variability of TLD reader measurements, irradiation inhomogeneity, and the optimal number of calibrations. It was also determined that the visible physical quality of TLDs, such {{as the presence of}} small fractures, scratches and discolorations, does not significantly affect sensitivity. A process for identifying useful TLDs from otherwise poor batches was formulated. Post-annealing TLD sensitivity changes, commonly referred to as pre-irradiation fading, and post-irradiation signal fading were examined for six common TL materials. To assist in data analysis, a generally useful glow curve analysis computer program was written using a common mathematics parser. Ratios of glow curve peaks, commonly used as self-normalizing quantities in TL dosimetry, were found for fading durations up to 30 d. Pre- and post-irradiation fading were individually fit to empirical functions of exponential form. For groups of LiF:Mg,Ti TLDs, it was found that a single <b>fading</b> <b>function</b> adequately described group behavior. For some deployments, the effects of high ambient temperature on fading must be known. LiF:Mg,Ti TLDs were subjected to controlled temperatures of 30 °C to 50 °C for up to 30 to 60 d. The sum of the areas of the two most stable glow curve peaks was found to be constant up to 50 °C where it fades slightly over long periods. The effects of high ambient radon on TLDs had not previously been well characterized. Radon was found to {{have a significant effect on}} bare TLDs and TLDs encapsulated in dosimetry cards, but no measureable effect on cards in environmental badges for ~ 1 MBq m^(- 3) h. The minimum detectable dose for a TLD system was analyzed based upon a dose-response linearity experiment and other results elsewhere in the dissertation. To conclude, a prototype system based upon integrating dosimetric materials is proposed as future work...|$|E
