The {{reason for this is}} the lack of a sense of justice. Especially because in the social and cultural context the truth is often relativized. In this context it is worth analysing the Pope Benedict XVI’s encyclical Caritas in Veritate, in which one should pay attention to a construction of the society in which today’s human person lives. Love and truth are the two attributes of a good society in with each human is equipped. From the very beginning, the human person is called to be directed by love and truth. He or she is called to this truth by his or her Christian life and ontic dimension of his or her nature. Society without love and truth will be threatened with agony, because it will not only stop developing but also <b>its</b> wrongly understood <b>economical</b> <b>status</b> will become a road to nowhere. That is why we should definitely accept the thesis that homo economicus must convert into homo religiosus in the name of love and truth, so that society will be good.

40|$|There is a {{controversy}} in the literature concerning the development of children's representations of economic inequality.

Thus, it's possible to consider that the structure of the system of super-individual activities in which the child is inserted plays a crucial part in the development of specific forms of social inequality representation.
