40|$|Microstructure, texture, colour and sensory {{properties}} of precooked restructured beef made with different proportions of walnut (0, 5, 10, 15 %) were studied {{in relation to}} meat particle size (grinder plate hole: 0. 6 and 1. 4 cm). In general, increasing amounts of walnut were matched by decreasing Kramer shear force (KSF), bind strength and elongation values. When walnut (5 and 15 %) was added, products made with coarsely ground meat presented higher KSF values than those made with finely ground meat. Walnut decreased lightness and increased redness and yellowness. Morphology characteristics suggest that walnut interferes {{with the formation of}} a gel protein network.

40|$|Consumers reveal {{preferences}} for fresh beef attributes through their retail beef purchases. Hedonic pricing methods {{were used to}} estimate the value consumers place on observable characteristics of fresh beef products, especially on retail beef brands. Primary {{data were collected from}} 65 randomly generated grocery stores located in three metropolitan areas, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Denver, Colorado. Retail beef package data were collected on 462 <b>ground</b> <b>products,</b> 175 roast products, and 756 steak products. There was some evidence retail beef brands command a price premium compared with unbranded, generic products. In this study, branding programs classified as “special” (i. e. no antibiotics, no hormones, all natural) offered the largest price premiums, but “other” types of branding programs offered price premiums as well. Price premiums for special brands were $ 1. 45 /lb. for <b>ground</b> <b>products</b> and $ 5. 87 /lb. for steak products. Labeling variables were not consistently significant in this study, indicating that labels associated with a brand name might offer consumers the most reassurance for their purchasing decision. The most important attributes affecting retail price per pound of <b>ground</b> beef <b>products</b> are store location (metropolitan area), store type, type of product, fat content, package size and type, expiration dates, brands and labels. Store location (metropolitan area) was important but store type was less important for explaining steak items than ground items. Steak prices were influenced by cut type, USDA quality grade, package size and type, and slightly by expiration date. Beef, Hedonic pricing, Marketing, Retail beef brands, Retail prices,...|$|R

50|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>product</b> is {{separated}} from the grinding medium at the discharge end of the mill. This is achieved without using screens by using a patented product separator that consists of a rotor and a displacement body (see Figure 2 and Figure 4).

This action retains the grinding medium within the mill.|$|E

A few designs have abrasive surfaces which do not rotate; each squeeze of the handles moves one flat plate past another, then the plates are restored to their original position by a spring.

40|$|ADDITIONAL INDEX WORDS. media physics, root media, air-filled pore space, waterholding {{capacity}} SUMMARY. Ground fresh rice (Oryza sativa) hull {{materials were}} produced by grinding whole fresh rice hulls and passing the resulting product through a 1 -, 2 -, 4 - or 6 -mm- diameter screen {{to produce a}} total of four <b>ground</b> rice <b>products</b> (RH 1, RH 2, RH 4, and RH 6, respectively). The physical properties and water release characteristics of sphagnum peatmoss (peat) and the four <b>ground</b> rice hull <b>products</b> were evaluated. All of the <b>ground</b> rice hull <b>products</b> had a higher bulk density (Bd) than peat, and as the grind size of the rice hull particle decreased, Bd increased. Peat had a higher total pore space (TPS) than all of the <b>ground</b> rice hull <b>products</b> except for RH 6. As grind size decreased, the TPS decreased. Peat had a lower air-filled pore space (AFP) than all of the <b>ground</b> rice hull <b>products</b> and as the grind size of the rice hull products decreased, AFP decreased. Peat had a higher water holding capacity (WHC) than all of the <b>ground</b> rice hull <b>products.</b> Grind sizes RH 4 and RH 6 had similar WHC, whereas RH 1 and RH 2 had a higher WHC than RH 4 and RH 6. Peat, RH 4, and RH 6 had similar available water content (AVW), whereas RH 2 had higher AVW than these materials and RH 1 had the highest AVW. However, peat had the lowest AVW and easily available water (EAW) {{as a percentage of the}} WHC. The <b>ground</b> rice hull <b>products</b> RH 1 and RH 2 had the highest AVW and EAW of the components tested. Peat had the highest water content at container capacity. As pressure was increased from 1 to 5 kPa, peat released water more slowly than any of the <b>ground</b> rice hull <b>products.</b> The RH 1 and RH 2 <b>ground</b> hull <b>products</b> released water at a significantly higher rate than peat, but RH 4 and RH 6 released the most water over these pressures. For all rice hull products, most water was released between 1 and 2 kPa pressure.

40|$|Various {{variables}} affecting grinding, such as air pressure, minerals or materials hardness, feed size were investigated. The {{limitations of}} grinding of gypsum, barite, ilmenite, quartz and ferrosilicon were also elucidated {{by means of}} particlefineness size distribution and morphology of <b>ground</b> <b>products.</b> It was found that: 1) The density of particles, which are in the grinding zone affects the product fineness, i. e. higher feed rate resultsin a larger product size. The appropriate feed rate is suggested to be 0. 2 ~ 0. 5 g/s. Moreover, the density and hardness ofminerals or materials tend {{to have an effect}} on the product fineness. Heavy minerals, such as barite or ilmenite, exhibit afiner product size than lighter minerals, like quartz. However, for quartz, the higher hardness also results in a larger d 50. 2) Air pressure is the most vital variable which affects the grinding by a jet mill. The d 50 seems to relate to theapplied air pressure as a power law equation expressed as following:d 50 = aP b; as P 0 The a-value and b-value have been found to correlate to the feed size. The higher the air pressure applied the finerthe product size attained. Moreover, air pressure has a greater effect on hard minerals than on softer ones. 3) Feed size seems to have a small effect on <b>ground</b> the <b>product</b> fineness of soft materials, such as gypsum andbarite, but a significant effect on that of hard materials, such as ferrosilicon and quartz, in particularly by milling at low airpressures of 2 ~ 3 kg/cm 2. 4) For the breakage behavior and morphology of ground materials, it was also found that the minerals having cleavages,such as gypsum and barite, tend to be broken along their cleavage planes. Thus, the particle size distribution of theseproducts becomes narrower. While quartz, ilmenite, and ferrosilicon have shattering and chipping breakage mechanisms,grinding results in angular shapes of the <b>ground</b> <b>products</b> and a wider size distribution. Blocks or platelets and agglomerationsmay occur during grinding of soft minerals, like gypsum, especially at lower and higher air pressures, respectively...|$|R

At a constant slurry percent solids, addition of the polymer caused a similar reduction in slurry viscosity for each material. For quartz, dolomite, and the copper ore, grinding efficiency, as measured by kilogram of product per kilowatt hour passing a given screen size, was not affected by the addition of the polymer.
