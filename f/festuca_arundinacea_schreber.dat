A complex of Thysanoptera (thrips) species inhabits citrus, {{some of which are}} considered pests. This study investigated the effect of ground cover management on thrips species composition, distribution, and seasonal abundance in four commercial clementine mandarin (Citrus clementina Tanaka) orchards. Three soil management systems were compared: resident vegetation, <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> <b>Schreber</b> (Poales: Poaceae), and bare soil. Cover management affected thrips species diversity and abundance. Two of the main species causing fruit damage in Spanish citrus, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) and Thrips tabaci Lindeman, were abundant in the resident ground cover. However, their abundance was strongly depressed in the F. arundinacea cover. The resident vegetation cover could provide a range of suitable host plants supporting populations of potential thrips pest species beyond the citrus blooming period. The F. arundinacea cover, which hosted Poaceae-specific thrips species, could also provide alternative food sources for Phytoseiidae mites. These predatory mites could reduce populations of potential thrips and other citrus pests below economic injury level. Our results confirm the suitability of F. arundinacea as a cover crop for clementine mandarins...|$|E
40|$|Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) {{is a key}} pest of {{clementine}} mandarins, Citrus clementina Tanaka (Rutaceae), in Spain. This mite {{is highly}} polyphagous and can be easily found in clementine orchards, both in the trees and in the associated flora. In a previous study {{we found that the}} use of a cover of <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> <b>Schreber</b> (Poaceae) offered a better regulation of T. urticae populations than either bare soil or the traditional wild cover, which included a mix of weed species. We hypothesized that the selection of two host races of T. urticae, specialized in F. arundinacea and C. clementina, could partly explain the results obtained (bottom-up regulation). Reciprocal transplant experiments show that sympatric deme × host combinations had higher mean fitness values than the allopatric combinations in clementine, but not in F. arundinacea, for most of the fitness parameters evaluated in our study. Because local adaptation implies mean deme fitness to be systematically higher for the sympatric deme × habitat combinations than for the allopatric ones, these results can be taken as indicative of occurrence of local adaptation in T. urticae. Molecular genetic analyses with microsatellite markers support this conclusion and indicate that local adaptation of T. urticae found in our system may indeed contribute to a better natural regulation of this mite...|$|E

40|$|Feeding on above- and belowground plant tissues by Tipula paludosa Meigen {{during the}} period of rapid growth from second to forth instars is highly {{damaging}} to cool-season (C 3) turfgrasses. It may be possible to reduce this damage by identifying grass genotypes that increase host plant protection. This study examined the impacts of plant genotype, endophyte infection, and plant ontogeny on host plant and insect responses during whole-plant feeding by T. paludosa. A series of no-choice greenhouse trials were conducted with third instar crane flies to determine 1) host plant tolerance in terms of reductions to above- and belowground plant biomass, 2) antixenosis resistance impacting insect behavior (emigration), and 3) antibiosis resistance impacting insect growth. Results showed that insect infestation level was the primary factor influencing plant biomass reductions. Belowground tissues were more tolerant to feeding than were aboveground tissues, with tall fescues, <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> <b>Schreber,</b> being most resistant to aboveground biomass reduction. Host plant associations with intercellular fungal endophytes (E+) decreased insect weight gain and decreased insect movement, but did not increase host plant tolerance. Plant ontogeny affected this response with insect weight gain significantly decreased on young (28 d) growth E+ grasses but not on old (90 d) growth E+ grasses, however. Host plant genotype and plant ontogeny can have significant impacts to host plant tolerance and insect physiology for T. paludosa larva.

40|$|Biological {{control of}} Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), a key pest of clementines, can be {{improved}} in this crop {{with the establishment of}} a ground cover of <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> <b>Schreber</b> (Poaceae). This cover houses an abundant and diverse community of predatory Phytoseiidae mites including Euseius stipulatus (Athias-Henriot), Neoseiulus barkeri Hughes, Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) and Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and a dense population of the grass thrips Anaphothrips obscurus Müller (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) throughout the year. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the presence of this thrips species could be related to the improvement in the biological control of T. urticae. Therefore, the capacity of the abovementioned phytoseiids to feed and reproduce on A. obscurus and their feeding preferences when T. urticae and A. obscurus were simultaneously offered, were analyzed. The results show that E. stipulatus, N. barkeri and N. californicus have a type II functional response when offered A. obscurus nymphs, whereas P. persimilis barely feeds on this thrips species. Furthermore, N. barkeri and N. californicus can reproduce feeding only on thrips. Regarding prey preference, the Tetranychus spp. -specialist P. persimilis preferably preyed on T. urticae, the generalists N. barkeri and E. stipulatus preferred A. obscurus, and the selective predator of tetranychid mites N. californicus showed no preference. Therefore, we hypothesize that the enhanced biological control of T. urticae observed could be related to A. obscurus becoming an alternative prey for non-specialist phytoseiids, without altering the control exerted by the T. urticae-specialist P. persimilis and likely reducing intraguild predation...|$|E
40|$|Cover crops {{can serve}} as a {{reservoir}} of natural enemies by supplying alternative food sources as pollen. However, pollen quality and availability can modulate phytoseiid communities. In clementine trees associated with a cover crop of <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> <b>Schreber,</b> these communities were more diverse than those associated with a multifloral wild cover crop. As a consequence, the former had a better regulation of Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) populations than the latter. Longer provision of higher quality pollen in the multifloral cover relative to F. arundinacea is suspected to interfere with the biological control of T. urticae by specific phytoseiid predators (Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor)) by enhancing the less efficient generalist pollen feeder Euseius stipulatus (Athias-Henriot) which is a superior intraguild predator. To determine whether pollen quality is behind these results, the effect of the provision of two different pollens (Carpobrotus edulis (L.) L. Bolus and F. arundinacea) on the efficacy of two phytoseiid species (E. stipulatus and N. californicus) to regulate T. urticae populations has been studied under semi-field conditions. Results suggest that pollen provision does not enhance the ability of these phytoseiids to reduce T. urticae populations. However, C. edulis pollen resulted in explosive increases of E. stipulatus numbers that did not occur with F. arundinacea pollen. Therefore, poor quality pollen may prevent pollen feeders from reaching high numbers in the field. This effect could benefit phytoseiid species suffering intraguild predation by E. stipulatus, the predominant phytoseiid species in Spanish citrus orchards and explain field results...|$|E

It was determined that the concentration of ergovaline, the major type of ergopeptide alkaloid, was increased but was not as high as that in nonflooded controls. Total ergopeptide and ergovaline concentrations in plants receiving high (220 mg of N per pot) and low (11 mg of N per pot) levels of NH 4 NO 3 fertilization were not affected by flooding. The form of nitrogen was important since all concentrations of NO 3 [...] N increased ergopeptide alkaloid content, as opposed to the effects of NH 4 +-N, which was effective only at high concentrations (34 mg of N per pot). Ergopeptide concentrations were highest in drought-stressed plants grown at - 0. 50 MPa and fertilized at the moderate or high N rate.

One typical Driselase digestion product (compound 17) yielded alpha-(1 [...] > 4) -D-[14 C]galacturonotriose(GalA 3) upon very mild treatment with alkali (50 % yield of GalA 3 in 7. 2 min at pH 11 and 25 degrees C). One of the three galacturonate residues in compound 17 was reducible to a galactose residue with sodium borohydride, indicating that that GalA residue was esterified, via its [...] COOH group, to a putative alcohol. Compound 17 had a higher mobility than GalA 3 on paper chromatography, indicating that the putative alcohol was relatively nonpolar. The putative alcohol could not have been methanol because Driselase readily hydrolyzed mono-, di-, and trimethyl esters of GalA 3 to yield free galacturonic acid. Another Driselase digestion product (compound 12) was a derivative of GalA 3 that apparently possessed two nonpolar esterified substituents: one about as labile as in compound 17, and the other approximately 10 times more stable. Compounds 12 and 17 could not labeled by in vivo feeding of [U- 14 C]cinnamate, suggesting that they were not phenolic conjugates.

40|$|Calcium enhances turfgrass {{response}} to salt stress. However, {{little is known}} about PSII photochemical changes when exogenous calcium was applied in salinity-stressed turfgrass. Here, we probe into the rearrangements of PSII electron transport and endogenous ion accumulation in tall fescue (<b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> <b>Schreber)</b> treated with exogenous calcium under salt stress. Three-month-old seedlings of genotype “TF 133 ” were subjected to the control (CK), salinity (S), salinity + calcium nitrate (SC), and salinity + ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (SE). Calcium nitrate and ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid was used as exogenous calcium donor and calcium chelating agent respectively. At the end of a 5 -day duration treatment, samples in SC regime had better photochemistry performance on several parameters than salinity only. Such as the Area (equal to the plastoquinone pool size), N (number of QA- redox turnovers until Fm is reached), ψE 0, or δRo (Efficiencdy/probability with which a PSII trapped electron is transferred from QA to QB or PSI acceptors), ABS/RC (Absorbed photon flux per RC). All the above suggested that calcium enhanced the electron transfer of PSII (especially beyond QA-) and prevented reaction centers from inactivation in salt-stressed tall fescue. Furthermore, both grass shoot and root tissues generally accumulated more C, N, Ca 2 +, and K+ in the SC regime than S regime. Interrelated analysis indicated that ψE 0, δRo, ABS/RC, C, and N content in shoots was highly correlated to each other and significantly positively related to Ca 2 + and K+ content in roots. Besides, high salt increased ATP 6 E and CAMK 2 transcription level in shoot at 1 and 5 day, respectively while exogenous calcium relieved it. In root, CAMK 2 level was reduced by Salinity at 5 day and exogenous calcium recovered it. These observations involved in electron transport capacity and ion accumulation assist in understanding better the protective role of exogenous calcium in tall fescue under salt stress...|$|E
40|$|Use of <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> for {{decorative}} lawns Summary <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> is briefly bentgrass with {{broader and}} coarser leaves. Hardly perennial grass, native to Europe, {{is well known}} for its high resistance of dry weather, low intensity of maintenance and resistance of high use. These qualities gains thanks to its well-developed and deep root system, which is capable to gain water and nutrients from deeper parts of soil. Its use is in places with high use, like a race-course, edges of roads or vineyards alleyway. Today, in time of global warming, its usage becomes more important for park purposes and low-input turfs, where is its higher resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses, mainly against drought, utilized. <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> complement well with Poa pratensis in turf. Goal of this work was to evaluate turfs with <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> and chosen grass species under different mowing frequency. According to hypothesis frequency shouldn´t affect turf coverage. Coverage should be same with different mixture composition with <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea.</b> The experiment was performed on experimental land of Czech university of Life Sciences Prague, Suchdol in 2015. Mixtures of <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> with <b>Festuca</b> rubra, Poa pratensis and Lolium perenne were seeded together with monocultures of these species in 2012. Mixture composition was 50 / 50 except mixture of Fesruca arundinacea and Poa pratensis, where the mixture was 75 / 25. There were conducted 63 plots, in 3 repetitions and in 3 different frequencies of mowing (by 14, 30 and 45 days). Each plot was 6 m 2 big. The results were evaluated by analysis of variance ANOVA (P is smaller than 0. 05) in program Statgraphics, version XV. Influence of mixture composition to level of growth was significant. The highest level of growth has monoculture of <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> (10, 6 cm). The lowest level of growth has monoculture of Lolium perenne (5, 4 cm). Monoculture of <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> had the highest intensity of grow (0, 07 cm/day) at 14 -day frequency of moving. Lolium perenne has the lowest intensity of grow (0, 02 cm/day). At 30 -day frequency of mowing mixture of <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> with Poa pratensis has the highest intensity of grow (0, 24 cm/day). The lowest intensity of grow has Lolium perenne (0, 01 cm/day). The highest intensity of grow was at 45 -day mowing frequency. The highest intensity of grow has mixture of <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> with <b>Festuca</b> rubra (0, 75 cm/day). The lowest intensity of grow has monoculture of Lolium perenne (0, 06 cm/day). Influence of mixture composition to coverage was statistically significant. The highest coverage has mixture of Festuca arundinace with Festuca rubra (81, 3 %). The lowest coverage has monoculture of Lolium perenne (58, 6 %). Influence of frequency to level of growth was statistically significant. The highest level of growth has 45 -day frequency of mowing (6 cm) and the lowest level of growth has 14 -day frequency of mowing (3, 8 cm). Influence of frequency to coverage was statistically significant. The highest coverage 14 -day frequency of moving (76, 5 %) and the lowest has 45 -day frequency of growing (66, 7 %). The knowledge gained will be used for further compilation grass mixtures for park lawns. It turned out that it is better to prefer seeding mixtures with <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> than monocultures. To achieve high coverage and optimal intensity of growth with <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> was recommended to follow 30 -day frequency of mowing...|$|R

The paper aims at assessing the quality of <b>Festuca</b> <b>Arundinacea</b> seeds and the efficiency of the methods to determine them. The biological material used consisted of <b>Festuca</b> <b>Arundinacea</b> seeds, Palma variety, stored in uncontrolled conditions, one year after harvest. The present paper assesses several seed parameters: total germination, normal seedlings, abnormal seedlings, dead seeds, seed weight, as well as the appearance of normal seedlings (after 7 to 14 days) through three laboratory methods: BP (between paper) test (V 1, V 2, V 3, V 4), sand S test (V 5) and top of paper TP test (V 6). Seed germination percentage for Palma variety ranged from 74 % (V 4) to 79 % (V 1 and V 6). Low germination is especially caused by the large number of dead seeds, the main cause being the improper storage conditions. According to the results of this experiment, cluster analysis showed the efficiency of the BP test, without pre-cooling, and of TP test, in emphasizing the quality characteristics of <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> seeds, Palma variety.

Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) is a cosmopolitan and polyphagous species that may reach the pest status in many cropping systems including clementine orchards, where it may be found both in {{the trees and the}} associated flora. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the use of a ground cover of <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> <b>Schreber</b> (Poaceae) offered a better regulation of T. urticae populations than traditional alternatives (bare soil, multifloral wild cover). Therefore, we decided to study the ambulatory dispersal of mites crawling up and down tree trunks in a clementine mandarin orchard grown in association with a F. arundinacea cover for one season. The highest ambulatory migration rate was upward from the cover to the canopy. Multivariate regressions showed that the dynamics of T. urticae populations in the trees was strongly related to that of Phytoseiidae mites, their main natural predators. Surprisingly, canopy populations were not related to those on the ground cover or to those dispersing from it. When T. urticae individuals collected from the ground cover, the tree trunk, and the canopy were subjected to molecular analyses, the optimal number of genetic clusters (demes) was two. One cluster grouped individuals dispersed from the ground cover (e. g. collected on tree trunks) and 27. 5 % of individuals collected in the ground cover. The second cluster grouped all the individuals collected from trees and 72. 5 % of those collected in the cover. Interestingly, none of the individuals collected from the tree canopies was grouped with the first deme. This result may be taken as indicative that grass-adapted T. urticae individuals are unable to satisfactorily colonize and establish on the trees and provides evidence that host adaptation can hamper dispersal and establishment of the ground cover deme on trees, contributing to a better natural regulation of this pest species in citrus...|$|E

The grass sward was cuted twice for year. First cut was in June and second cut in November. The proportion of <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> was 1. 0 % in June 2001 and 34. 2 % in June 2003. The proportion of Festulolium was 1. 0 % in June 2001 and 20. 6 % in June 2003. The additional sown species dominated more in November than in June. The proportion of <b>Festuca</b> <b>arundinacea</b> was fourth year for additional sown 73. 7 % and proportion of Festulolium 48. 7 %. The additional sown reflected on the change of herbage composition. The herbage composition was most expressive between second and third year...|$|R
