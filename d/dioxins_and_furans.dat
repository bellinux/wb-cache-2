25|$|The {{recycling}} of waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} in India and China generates {{a significant amount}} of pollution. Informal recycling in an underground economy of these countries has generated an environmental and health disaster. High levels of lead (Pb), polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated <b>dioxins</b> <b>and</b> <b>furans,</b> as well as polybrominated <b>dioxins</b> <b>and</b> <b>furans</b> (PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs) concentrated in the air, bottom ash, dust, soil, water, and sediments in areas surrounding recycling sites.|$|E
25|$|The {{concerns}} over {{the health effects of}} dioxin and furan emissions have been significantly lessened by advances in emission control designs and very stringent new governmental regulations that have resulted in large reductions in the amount of <b>dioxins</b> <b>and</b> <b>furans</b> emissions.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. An {{increase}} in population and related {{increased demand for}} health services, expansion of industries, and increasing transportation demands have increased the emission of <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Objective. This study aimed to identify sources of <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> emissions, quantify their release into various environmental medias and assess related management practices. Methods. The standard United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) (2005) toolkit guide and default emission factor were used to identify the main anthropogenic sources and to quantify the amount of released <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan.</b> Stratified random sampling techniques were applied to assess current management practices. Results. Nine main groups of <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> emission sources were identified. The emission of each source group was calculated by the activity rate data multiplied by an emission factor. The results found that about 138. 85 g toxic equivalent(TEQ) /a(TEQ/year) of <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> were released to air, water, residue (materials remaining as sludge after sewage treatment or {{in the form of}} ash after incineration activity) and soil. Waste disposal activities recorded the largest release of <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan,</b> accounting for 68. 30 g TEQ/a of <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> to water <b>and</b> residue, 34. 00 g TEQ/a to air and 0. 64 g TEQ/a emitted into soil. Conclusions. Several sources of <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> emission were identified and the present study found that their management is inadequate. Waste disposal services are especially inadequate and generate higher amounts of <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> gasses. In addition, the organizations that are responsible for the release of <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> have no awareness of their release and inadequate management practices. The present study points to the need for reformulation of the national legal management framework, adoption of best available technology for disposal services such as incinerators with flue gas management, increasing public and stakeholders' awareness and participation and capacitating the responsible government organizations.

50|$|A {{study of}} <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> content of stack gasses {{at a variety}} of cement mills, paper mills, boilers, and power plants {{conducted}} in the 1990s shows a wide and inconsistent variation in <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> output when fueled partially by TDF as compared to the same facilities powered by only coal. Some facilities added as little as 4% TDF and experienced as much as a 4,140% increase in <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> emsissions. Other facilities added as much as 30% TDF <b>and</b> experienced <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> emissions increases of only as much as 58%. Still other facilities used as much as 8% TDF and experienced a decrease of as much as 83% of <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> emissions. One facility conducted four tests with two tests resulting in decreased emissions and two resulting in increased emissions. Another facility also conducted four tests and had widely varying increases in emissions.|$|R

25|$|There are 12 {{compounds}} {{in the list}} of persistent organic pollutants. <b>Dioxins</b> <b>and</b> <b>furans</b> are two of them and intentionally created by combustion of organics, like open burning of plastics. These compounds are also endocrine disruptors and can mutate the human genes.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>dioxins</b> <b>and</b> <b>furans</b> may be {{destroyed}} by combustion, their reformation {{by a process}} known as 'de novo synthesis' as the emission gases cool is a probable source of the dioxins measured in emission stack tests from plants that have high combustion temperatures held at long residence times.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that the {{incident}} resulted from the contamination of fuel oil used in a drying burner at a single feed processor, with PCBs.

40|$|The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments {{require the}} {{development}} of maximum achievable control technology standards (MACT) for sources of hazardous air pollutants, including landfill gas-fired combustion sources. The Industrial Combustion Coordinated Rulemaking (ICCR) Federal Advisory Committee {{is a group of}} stakeholders from the public and private sector whose charge is to develop recommendations for a unified set of federal toxic air emissions regulations. Specifically, the group will establish MACT standards for industrial-commercial-institutional combustion sources. The ICCR proceedings have given rise to considerable interest in potential <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> emissions from landfill gas-fired combustion units. In order to establish the potential of <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> emissions from this group of combustion sources, a world-wide literature search was conducted. A total of 22 references were evaluated. The references covered a wide range of test programs, testing methodologies and combustion equipment type. The most abundant data was for landfill gas-fired flares (shrouded and afterburners) and I. C. engines. Because of limitations in obtaining actual test reports with complete lab data and QA/QC results, and a lack of knowledge as to the exact types of waste received at the European landfills, the test data from these sources, {{for the purposes of this}} paper, are considered qualitative. The conclusion reached from review of the test data is that there is a potential for <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> emissions from landfill gas-fired combustion units, but at very low levels for well operated systems...|$|R

25|$|Most of the {{improvement}} in U.S. dioxin emissions has been for large-scale municipal waste incinerators. As of the year 2000, although small-scale incinerators (those with a daily capacity of less than 250 tons) processed only 9% of the total waste combusted, these produced 83% of the <b>dioxins</b> <b>and</b> <b>furans</b> emitted by municipal waste combustion.|$|E
25|$|The most publicized {{concerns}} from environmentalists {{about the}} incineration of municipal solid wastes (MSW) involve {{the fear that}} it produces significant amounts of dioxin and furan emissions. <b>Dioxins</b> <b>and</b> <b>furans</b> are {{considered by many to}} be serious health hazards. The EPA announced in 2012 that the safe limit for human oral consumption is 0.7 picograms Toxic Equivalence (TEQ) per kilogram bodyweight per day, which works out to 17 billionths of a gram for a 150lb person per year.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of {{the trade}} argue that {{developing}} countries utilize methods that are more harmful and more wasteful. An expedient and prevalent method is simply to toss equipment onto an open fire, in order to melt plastics and to burn away non-valuable metals. This releases carcinogens and neurotoxins into the air, contributing to an acrid, lingering smog. These noxious fumes include <b>dioxins</b> <b>and</b> <b>furans.</b> Bonfire refuse can be disposed of quickly into drainage ditches or waterways feeding the ocean or local water supplies.|$|E

Thus, the controlled combustion of waste accounted for 41.7% of the total dioxin inventory.|$|R
40|$|A {{sediment}} {{quality survey}} was conducted in the Florida Panhandle (Panhandle) {{over a period of}} 10 years (1992 to 2001). The survey examined which <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> compounds may be present in sediments of the bay systems, their locations, and concentrations. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) collected and analyzed 29 sediment samples from 6 bay systems across the Panhandle. Risk associated with <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> contamination was estimated after 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxicity equivalents (TEQs) were calculated for 17 dioxin/furan chemical analytes as per the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (1989). Total dioxin TEQ sediment concentrations ranged from 0. 51 ng/kg dry weight in Apalachicola Bay to 77. 51 ng/kg dry weight in sediments from the Perdido Bay system. Pulp and paper processing facilities were near sampling locations where TEQ concentrations were over 20 ng/kg dry weight {{with the exception of one}} site in the Pensacola Bay system. Overall, the concentrations of dioxin TEQs in sediments of Panhandle bay systems were relatively low compared to similar surveys in the Great Lakes area and other bay systems worldwide.

25|$|Controlled {{high-temperature}} incineration, above 850°C for two seconds, {{performed with}} selective additional heating, breaks down toxic <b>dioxins</b> <b>and</b> <b>furans</b> from burning plastic, and {{is widely used}} in municipal solid waste incineration. Municipal solid waste incinerators also normally include flue gas treatments to reduce pollutants further. This is needed because uncontrolled incineration of plastic produces polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, a carcinogen (cancer causing chemical). The problem occurs because the heat content of the waste stream varies. Open-air burning of plastic occurs at lower temperatures, and normally releases such toxic fumes.|$|E

Mixed wastes are defined as those wastes that contain both radioactive components, which are regulated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and hazardous waste components, which are regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has installed and operated a bench-scale MSO apparatus to obtain experimental information needed before the design and construction of an MSO pilot plant. The primary objective of the experiments performed was to show that <b>dioxin</b> <b>and</b> <b>furan</b> emissions from a molten salt oxidation (MSO) unit were below the proposed regulatory limit of 0. 1 ng/m{sup 3 } as 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin equivalents or toxic equivalence quotient.

Generally speaking, respiratory and cardiac effects are the most significant, but there is increasing evidence that air pollutants play a role in cancer and genetic mutations, some of which [...] inherited. Cumulative and synergistic effects are hard to study: ethical concerns rule out some otherwise desirable experimental procedures, and multi-pollutant studies are complex and expensive, leaving these areas less well understood experimentally. Sometimes ecologic studies can contribute to our understanding of combined effects.
