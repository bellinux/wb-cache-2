40|$|Endothelin- 1 {{secretion}} {{and sympathetic}} activation may play {{important role in}} cardiovascular pathophysiology. In vivo interactions between these systems are not defined. We aimed to study the electrophysiological and haemodynamic effects of simultaneous intracoronary endothelin- 1 and intravenous isoproterenol infusions. 18 anaesthetised open chest dogs were studied after AV-ablation. Mean arterial blood pressure, coronary blood flow, left ventricular contractility, standard electrocardiograms, right and left ventricular epi- and endocardial monophasic action potential (MAP) signals were recorded. Intracoronary endothelin- 1 (30 pmol/min) was given to Group ET (n= 6), intravenous isoproterenol (0. 2 microg/kg/min) to Group ISO (n= 6), both endothelin- 1 and isoproterenol to Group ET+ISO (n= 6) for 30 min. MAP duration increased in all studied regions of Group ET, decreased in all studied regions of Group ISO and ET+ISO (control vs. maximal changes of left ventricular epicardial MAP 90 % duration, Group ET: 296 +/- 22 vs 369 +/- 20 ms, p< 0. 05, Group ISO: 298 +/- 18 vs 230 +/- 27 ms, p< 0. 01, Group ET+ISO: 302 +/- 18 vs 231 +/- 10 ms, p< 0. 01). In Group ET, <b>early</b> <b>after</b> <b>depolarisations</b> (3 / 6), polymorphic non-sustained ventricular tachycardias (6 / 6), and ventricular fibrillation (3 / 6) could be observed. In Group ISO, monomorphic non-sustained ventricular tachycardias (5 / 6) and atrial fibrillation (3 / 6) appeared. In Group ET+ISO, mono- and polymorphic non-sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred (5 / 6), neither ventricular fibrillation nor atrial fibrillation developed. An additive effect of endothelin- 1 and isoproterenol on left ventricular contractility was observed. Isoproterenol treatment showed antagonistic effect against endothelin- 1 induced MAP duration prolongation, early after depolarisation and ventricular fibrillation formation, while endothelin- 1 showed protective effect against the development of isoproterenol induced atrial fibrillation...|$|E
40|$|Late sodium {{current in}} cardiac cells {{is very small}} {{compared}} with the fast component, but as it flows throughout the action potential it may make a substantial contribution to sodium loading during each cardiac cycle. Late sodium current may contribute to triggering arrhythmia in two ways: by causing repolarisation failure (<b>early</b> <b>after</b> depolarisations); and by triggering late <b>after</b> <b>depolarisations</b> attributable to calcium oscillations in sodium-calcium overload conditions. Reduction of late sodium current would therefore {{be expected to have}} therapeutic benefits, particularly in disease states such as ischaemia in which sodium-calcium overload is a major feature...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND In 1785, Withering {{discovered}} use of {{a cardiac}} glycoside from foxglove plant for the therapy of congestive heart failure. For centuries, digoxin use had been controversial for the risk benefit ratio. Digoxin affect the myocardium by affecting the autonomic nervous system. Antiadrenergic and parasympathetic stimuli suppressing SA node, but delayed <b>after</b> <b>depolarisation</b> of atrial muscles causes generation of multiple atrial pacemaker foci presenting {{in the form of}} MAT. The association of MAT with digoxin is poorly studied because of the rarity of both together. This case had multiple risk factor of advanced age, hypokalaemia, heart failure in presence of chronic digoxin exposure caused MAT. Withdrawal of digoxin along with correction of electrolyte imbalance and heart failure caused reversal of MAT to sinus rhythm. Early detection and correction prevents conversion of MAT to AF...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) is a {{heterogenous}} disease {{that can lead}} to persistent disability or death. The immediate mechanical disruption of brain tissue is followed by a phase of secondary brain injury. During this phase TBI challenges clinical interventions due to its complexity. Increased knowledge is needed about the operating molecules and their timewindows. We used cerebral cortical contusions by weight drop and experimental depolarisation, in order to analyse molecular and genetic responses. Alterations in gene expression were studied by microarrays, RTPCR, in situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. Nestin is an intermediate filament, expressed in CNS progenitor cells during embryogenesis, but restricted to residing stemcells in adults. Depolarisation induced nestin expression in astrocytes along the ipsilateral cortex. A blockade by the MK- 801 reduced nestin expression. The nestin expression in reactive astrocytes is interesting since they form the glial scar. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors TIMPs, determine extracellular matrix turnover and cause overgrowth or disruption when disturbed. We found a time-dependent increase of neuronal TIMP- 1 and MMP- 9 expression in the ipsilateral cortex <b>after</b> <b>depolarisation</b> and contusion. The early expression of TIMP- 1 could be a MMP- 9 independent protective response to damage. TIMP- 1 and MMP- 9 are likely to participate in the tissue reorganisation or neuroprotection. <b>After</b> experimental contusion <b>early</b> and delayed genomic responses were significantly different for genes involved in transcription, cell communication, cell proliferation, cell-death and metabolism. In the early phase genes involved in "transcription" and "cell-death" were prominent, while "immune response" and "proteolysis" dominated the delayed phase. Osteopontin and the CD 44 receptor are involved in inflammation, and were locally upregulated at the impact site. Genes of the calcium signaling pathway i. a. hippocalcin and VILIP- 1, were suppressed while genes of the complement and coagulation pathways were upregulated. Depolarisation and experimental contusion largely shared genomic responses. NMDA receptor blockade <b>after</b> <b>depolarisation</b> abolished the regulated genes to a larger extent than after contusion. Genes for nestin, MMP- 9, TIMP- 1, osteopontin and CD 44 were similarly regulated in both models. Almost all depolarisation induced effects were detected in traumatically injured animals, while some post-traumatic changes appeared to be independent of depolarisation. The findings corroborated that depolarisation was a mechanism in experimental trauma. Microarrays could be used to produce a comprehensive image of regulated genes at a specific time or to allow an unbiased search for relevant events...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} {{that there is a}} turnover in active muscle of a phosphate fraction which remains attached to the muscle after extraction with aqueous media, was investigated further. A reversible decrease in the specific activity was found when loaded or unloaded frog recti (briefly labelled with-orthophosphate) were contracted by treatment with KCl. Even in the absence of shortening (under isometric conditions or in the absence of calcium ions) a decrease in the specific activity occurred <b>after</b> <b>depolarisation</b> of the membranes. A similar change in specific activity was found when P-labelled glycerol-extracted psoas fibrils were treated with ATP or ITP in the presence of magnesium ions. Ho change occurred when the fibrils were treated with ATP and calcium ions. 2, 4 -Dinitrophenol did not inhibit the effect of ATP and magnesium ions on the bound phosphate of the myofibrils. In the intact muscle the ATP-p and the P of PC do not become 30 equally labelled when incubated with P-orthophosphate for 60 min. That material which is extracted as Pi by trichloracetic acid from acetone-dried washed muscle residues has a similar degree of labelling as the ATP-p is isolated from whole muscles. <p...|$|R
40|$|The 4. 1 {{proteins}} {{are part}} of the spectrin-associated cytoskeleton, promote mechanical stability of plasma membranes and are required for cell surface expression of several ion transporters. Protein 4. 1 R is expressed in the heart and upregulated in human heart failure but its functional role in the myocardium is unknown. 4. 1 R deficient mice (4. 1 RKO) have prolonged QT interval and, at cardiomyocyte level, prolonged action potential duration and Ca 2 + regulation abnormalities. The causes for these changes remain elusive. We have measured, using whole-cell patch clamping of isolated cardiomyocytes from 4. 1 RKO, the persistent Na+ current (IpNa), implicated in long QT interval in patients. From a holding potential of - 100 mV increasing voltage (20 mV) steps from – 80 mV to + 20 mV for 1 s were applied. The protocol was repeated in the presence of 30 µM tetradotoxin (TTX), and the TTX-sensitive current was analysed. IpNa density was increased in 4. 1 RKO myocytes compared with wild type (WT) (average IpNa density between 50 and 100 ms <b>after</b> <b>depolarisation</b> for steps to – 20 mV (pA/pF) : WT = – 0. 53 ± 0. 03 (16); 4. 1 R KO = – 0. 36 ± 0. 05 (25) (Mean ± SEM (n)); p< 0. 01; IpNa integral between 50 and 300 ms <b>after</b> <b>depolarisation</b> (pC/pF) : WT = – 57 ± 9 (16); 4. 1 R KO = – 98 ± 9 (25); p< 0. 01). To evaluate possible direct binding between SCN 5 a and 4. 1 R, a peptide biotin-EPITTTLRRKHEEVSA was synthesized (SCN 5 a-pep: corresponding to residues 1893 – 1909 of SCN 5 a and similar to a 4. 1 R binding sequence of anion exchanger AE 1). A scrambled version of the wild type peptide was used as control. The peptides were mixed with extracts from COS 7 cells that had been transfected with a mouse 120 kDa cardiac 4. 1 R tagged with the HA epitope, or extract from cells transfected with vector only. After incubation, bound complexes were recovered on streptavidin beads, and analysed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody. The 120 kDa band corresponding to 4. 1 R was found only in the SCN 5 a-pep and not in the control peptide pull-down suggesting that SCN 5 a can bind 4. 1 R. Our data indicate a novel function for protein 4. 1 R in modulating the properties of the Na+ channel, possibly by direct interaction. This may underlie a significant role of proteins 4. 1 on the electrophysiology of the heart in normal conditions and in disease...|$|R
40|$|We {{asked to}} what extent Ca 2 + signals in two {{different}} domains of Paramecium cells remain separated during different stimulations. Wild-type (7 S) and pawn cells (strain d 4 - 500 r, without ciliary voltage-dependent Ca 2 +-channels) were stimulated for trichocyst exocytosis within 80 ms by quenched-flow preparation and analysed by energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX), paralleled by fast confocal fluorochrome analysis. We also analysed depolarisation-dependent calcium signalling during ciliary beat rerversal, also by EDX, after 80 -ms stimulation in the quenched-flow mode. EDX and fluorochrome analysis enable to register total and free intracellular calcium concentrations, [Ca] and [Ca 2 +], respectively. After exocytosis stimulation we find by both methods that the calcium signal sweeps into the basis of cilia, not only in 7 S but also in pawn cells which then also perform ciliary reversal. <b>After</b> <b>depolarisation</b> we see an increase of [Ca] along cilia selectively in 7 S, but not in pawn cells. Opposite to exocytosis stimulation, during depolarisation no calcium spill-over into the nearby cytosol and no exocytosis occurs. In sum, we conclude that cilia must contain a very potent Ca 2 + buffering system and that ciliary reversal induction, much more than exocytosis stimulation, involves strict microdomain regulation of Ca 2 + signals...|$|R
