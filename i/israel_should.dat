5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} U.S. would avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E
25|$|On November 5 2013, HaKohen told {{students}} at Hunter College in New York City that {{peace in the}} conflict must be synonymous with unity and that <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> embrace a more inclusive “Semitic identity.” He criticized the international community for aggressively pushing a two-state solution on Israelis and Palestinians and expressed particular frustration with Israel’s relationship with the United States, stating that <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> stop “trying to be a Western satellite in the Middle East” and calling for Israel to integrate into the region by improving its relationship with its neighbors.|$|E

25|$|Why/What {{are these}} Three Oaths? One, that <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> not storm the wall {RaShI interprets: forcefully}. Two, the Holy One adjured Israel not to rebel against {{the nations of}} the world. Three, the Holy One adjured the nations that they would not oppress Israel too much.|$|E
25|$|Zettler {{remained}} on Israel's political right wing, retaining a long-held suspicion of Arabs and foreigners in Israel, {{and believed that}} <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> retain territories occupied during the Six-Day War. In his later years, he lived in Tel Aviv and ran a gas station in Jaffa.|$|E
25|$|Antisemitism in Armenia has {{primarily}} {{resulted from}} Israel's reluctance {{to recognize the}} Armenian Genocide due to its close ties with Turkey, a subject which many Armenians believe Jews and <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> relate and be sympathetic to, since both share a similar national history and fate. Excluding the aforementioned, Armenian and Jews relations have historically been benevolent, respectful, and at times, competitive/rivaling.|$|E
50|$|He also {{believes}} that the main principle of the Basic Law: <b>Israel</b> Lands <b>should</b> remain unchanged since {{it is one of}} the fundamental features of the Israeli legal system. Another reason is that Israel is a small country with limited land reserves.|$|R

25|$|In the Golan Heights {{there is}} another area {{occupied}} by Israel, namely the Shebaa farms. Syria and Lebanon have claimed that the farms belong to Lebanon and in 2007 a UN cartographer {{came to the conclusion}} that the Shebaa farms do actually belong to Lebanon (contrary to the belief held by Israel). UN then said that <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> relinquish the control of this area.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} voting of the UN General Assembly Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu stated that <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> {{question}} why {{it did not}} have the support by the majority of countries at the Palestine Vote in the UN General Assembly and declared that Palestine was now a state.

50|$|As {{part of the}} anti-Nazi Boycott of 1933, Rabbi Margolies {{rose from}} his sickbed to address the {{overflow}} crowd at Madison Square Garden on March 27, 1933, bringing the crowd of 20,000 to its feet with his prayers that the antisemitic persecution cease and that the hearts of <b>Israel's</b> enemies <b>should</b> be softened.|$|R
25|$|On January 10, 2012, Benny Gantz, the Israeli {{military}} {{chief of}} staff, informed {{members of the}} Knesset that {{in the event of}} the Syrian government's collapse, Israel was prepared to permit fleeing Syrian Alawites settlement in the Golan Heights. Former Mossad chief Efraim Halevy suggested that <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> exploit the Shia-Sunni conflict. On 2 April 2011, in the village of Buq'ata, in the Golan Heights, 2,000 Druze protested in support of Assad, waving Syrian flags and portraits.|$|E
25|$|The book of Jubilees {{taught that}} it was ordained that the {{children}} of <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> afflict themselves on the tenth day of the seventh month {{because that was the}} day that the news came to Jacob that made him weep for the loss of his son Joseph. His descendants thus made atonement for themselves with a young goat, for Joseph's brothers had slaughtered a kid and dipped the coat of Joseph in the blood, and sent it to Jacob on that day.|$|E
25|$|Leviticus 1–16 {{sees the}} world as divided between the profane (i.e., not holy) masses and the holy priests. Anyone who incurs {{impurity}} must {{be separated from the}} priests and the Temple until purity is restored through washing, sacrifice, and the passage of time. Leviticus 17–26 is called the Holiness code, from its repeated insistence that <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> be a holy people; scholars accept it as a discrete collection within the larger Priestly source, and have traced similar holiness writings elsewhere in the Pentateuch.|$|E
50|$|The Terra Sancta Church (Ecclesia Terra Sancta {{which means}} Holy Land Church) also {{alternatively}} Church of St. Francis {{is the name}} given to the Roman Catholic church located in the Old City of Acre in northern <b>Israel.</b> It <b>should</b> {{not be confused with}} the other Franciscan temple of the city, the Church of St. John Baptist.|$|R

25|$|For {{commentators}} with {{a public}} audience to delegitimize Israel at this time is hurtful, undermines existing needed support and, at least in that manner, encourages <b>Israel's</b> enemies. We <b>should</b> and must say so — as Alvin Rosenfeld has done.|$|R
25|$|Ideological {{disputes}} {{were also}} widespread. Israel had been initially recognized {{by both the}} United States and the Soviet Union. For {{the first three years}} of its existence, Israel was in the Non-Aligned Movement, but David Ben-Gurion gradually began to take sides with the West. The question of which side of the Cold War <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> choose created fissures in the kibbutz movement. Dining halls segregated according to politics and a few kibbutzim even had Marxist members leave. The disillusionment particularly set in after the Slánský trial in which an envoy of Hashomer Hatzair in Prague was tried.|$|E
25|$|Uruguay has {{consistently}} supported Lebanon in disputes with Israel. When the 1978 South Lebanon conflict broke out, the Uruguay parliament {{was the only}} one in South America to take a decision demanding implementation of the 1978 United Nations Security Council Resolution 425, calling on Israel to immediately withdraw its forces from Lebanon. During the 2006 Lebanon War, five Uruguayan families of Lebanese origin were caught up in the conflict, but managed to escape from Lebanon to Syria. Uruguay coordinated with Venezuela to evacuate their citizens. Uruguayan Foreign Minister Reinaldo Gargano stated that <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> cease fire and begin talks with Lebanon under the supervision of the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|Post 9/11 remarks made by Muslim {{leaders in}} Cleveland and Los Angeles {{also led to}} the {{suspension}} of longstanding Muslim-Jewish dialogues. Some Jewish community leaders cite the statements as the latest evidence that Muslim-Jewish dialogue is futile in today's charged atmosphere. John Rosove, senior rabbi of Temple Israel of Hollywood, and other Jewish participants withdrew from the three-year-old Muslim-Jewish dialogue group {{after one of the}} Muslim participants, Salam al-Marayati of MPAC, suggested in a radio interview that <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> be put on the list of suspects behind the 11 September attacks. However, in January 2011, MPAC member Wa’el Azmeh and Temple Israel engaged in an interfaith dialogue.|$|E

25|$|Some 15,000 Palestinians held {{a protest}} march in Gaza City, and militants vowed renewed attacks against Israel. In Nablus, {{hundreds}} chanted anti-Abbas slogans during a protest. Most business {{owners in the}} Gaza Strip began shutting down their stores in protest of the operation, thereby launching a spontaneous general strike. All the armed Palestinian organizations except Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades issued statements threatening to harm <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> it not halt the operation. Meanwhile, the Israel Prison Service decided to raise the alert level in all Israeli prisons where Palestinian security prisoners were being held.

25|$|In recent years, some {{politicians}} and political commentators representing {{the right wing}} of Israeli politics have advocated annexing the West Bank and granting its Palestinian population Israeli citizenship while maintaining Israel's current status as a Jewish state with recognized minorities. In 2013, Likud MK Tzipi Hotovely argued that Jordan was originally created as the Arab state in the British Mandate of Palestine and that <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> annex the West Bank as a historic part of the Land of Israel. Naftali Bennett, leader of the Jewish Home party, included in many Likud-led coalitions, argues for the annexation of Zone C of the West Bank. Zone C, agreed upon as part of the Oslo Accords, comprises about 60% of West Bank land and is currently under Israeli military control.|$|E
25|$|The {{worship of}} Yahweh alone {{began at the}} {{earliest}} with Elijah in the 9th century BCE, but more likely with the prophet Hosea in the 8th; even then it remained the concern of a small party before gaining ascendancy in the exilic and early post-exilic period. The early supporters of this faction are widely regarded as being monolatrists rather than true monotheists; {{they did not believe}} that Yahweh was the only god in existence, but instead believed that he was the only god the people of <b>Israel</b> <b>should</b> worship. Finally, in the national crisis of the exile, the followers of Yahweh went a step further and outright denied that the other deities aside from Yahweh even existed, thus marking the transition from monolatrism to true monotheism.|$|E
5000|$|Johnson has {{expressed}} support for Israel, arguing that it should adopt the Pace Amendment model.
