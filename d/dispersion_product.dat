40|$|Previous {{research}} has examined whether price dispersion exists in theoretically highly efficient Internet markets. However, {{much of the}} previous work {{has been focused on}} industries with low cost and undifferentiated products. In this paper, we examine the presence of price dispersion and product differentiation using data on the airline ticket offerings of online travel agents (OTAs). We find that different OTAs offer tickets with substantially different prices and characteristics when given the same customer request. Some of this variation appears to be due to product differentiation [...] -different OTAs specialize by systematically offering different trade-offs between ticket price and ticket quality (minimizing the number of connections, matching requested departure and return time). However, even after accounting for differences in ticket quality, ticket prices vary by as much as 18 % across OTAs. In addition, OTAs return tickets that are strictly inferior to the ticket offered by another OTA for the same request between 2. 2 % and 28 % of the time. Overall, this suggests the presence of both price dispersion and product differentiation in the online travel market.

Aiming at increasing stability and availability of 5 -Fluorouracil liposomal products, 5 -Fluorouacil Stable Plurilamellar Vesicles were prepared. Freeze dried liposomal dispersions were prepared with or without cryoprotectants. The cryoprotectants used were glucose, mannitol or trehalose in 1, 2 and 4 grams per gram phospholipids. The results showed that lyophilized cake of liposomes without cryoprotectants was compact and difficult to reconstitute, in comparison with fluffy cakes which reconstituted easily and quickly when using cryoprotectants. The percentage of 5 -Fluorouracil retained in liposomes freeze-dried without cryoprotectants was 18. 29 % ± 0. 96 % {{and the percentage of}} 5 -Fluorouracil retained in stable plurilamellar vesicles was 31. 22 % ± 0. 62 % using 4 grams trehalose as cryoprotectant per gram of lipid.

The first paper uses search cost and product differentiation {{to explain the}} price dispersion using only data on price. If search costs are present, the search burden can lead to market inefficiency. If product differentiation is {{the main cause of}} price dispersion, the market competition can increases consumer welfare. The model improves the current sequential search model by taking product differentiation into consideration. The results show that both product differentiation and search cost result in price <b>dispersion.</b> <b>Product</b> differentiation explains about 55 % of the price dispersion. The magnitude of search costs is large and the counter-factual experiment shows that reduced search cost could reduce both market average price and price dispersion. The second paper uses a dynamic investment model to tackle three critical issues in renewable energy in the electricity industry. First, current renewable energy policies do not differentiate the carbon intensity of nonrenewable resources, which makes them less cost effective in reducing the carbon emission. Second, when making investment decisions, power plants take uncertainties into consideration. Lastly, the electricity generation market is unique that the players in the market not only compete in the hourly spot market but also compete with long-term investment strategies. A dynamic investment model considers all three issues simultaneously by simulating both short term and long term firm behavior under different market design parameter settings...|$|E

Methodology. To simulate the toxic chemical <b>dispersion</b> (<b>product</b> of the solid rocket propellant firing) the equation of convective-diffusion transfer is used.

To calculate the process of the indoor contamination {{in the case of the}} contaminated air infiltration a balance model is used. This model takes into account the ventilation flow rate, volume of the room, concentration of toxic chemical in the inlet air. To compute the ventilation flow rate the empirical model was used.

On the basis of the developed numeral model numerical experiment was carried out which allowed to estimate the level of atmosphere contamination in Pavlograd city. Findings.

In this study {{only a handful of}} these chemical components were evaluated for their rheological modifying properties with slurries. These compounds are cis- and trans-aconitic acids, citric acids, and a modified starch. A yield stress-pH technique was used to probe the surface forces arising from these adsorbed additives in colloidal alumina dispersions. Citric acid and starch decreased the maximum yield stress of the dispersion very significantly. These compounds adsorbed and acted as a steric layer. In contrast trans-aconitic acid increased the maximum yield stress quite substantially while its cis- counterpart did neither increase nor decrease the maximum yield stress. The trans-aconitic acid behaves as an effective particle-bridging agent. Its ciscounterpart is neither effective as a bridging or steric agent. Trans-aconitic acid may be used as an additive for strengthening colloidal gels commonly found in foods and cosmetics. The others may be used to reduce gel strength or yield stress of colloidal <b>dispersion</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Solid dispersions of poorly {{water-soluble}} drug, indomethacin (IMC), and carriers at a {{ratio of}} 1 : 9 were prepared by melting method. The carriers used in this study were polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4000), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and pectin. The solid dispersions obtained were characterized by powder x-ray diffractometry (PXRD) and dissolution studies. PXRD patterns showed that all solid dispersions led to amorphous products while their physical mixture still showed the crystalline state of drug. Crystalline drug was clearly detectable in solid <b>dispersion</b> <b>products</b> containing only IMC and PEG 4000 after storage for 2 months. The formulations with biopolymer (i. e., HPMC, pectin or their combination) showed no drug crystal after storage. More than 80 % of IMC dissolved within 5 minutes for all formulations after preparation while less than 40 % of IMC dissolved, within 5 minutes, from the formulations containing IMC, PEG 4000 and HPMC after storage for 2 months. The slower drug dissolution {{may be due to the}} gel-forming properties of HPMC as well as the agglomeration of the products after storage. The results suggested that either HPMC or pectin in solid dispersions can help to prevent the crystallization of amorphous IMC in solid dispersion, probably by a polymer anti-plasticizing effect. Pectin showed superior stabilizing effect with no retardation effect on drug dissolution...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Many {{new drug}} {{substances}} have low aqueous solubility {{which can cause}} poor bioavailability after oral administration. The application of solid dispersions is a useful method to increase the dissolution rate of these drugs and thereby improve their bioavailability. So far, several methods {{have been developed to}} prepare solid dispersions. To obtain a product with the desired attributes, both the formulation and production processes should be considered. Areas covered: The most currently used methods to produce solid dispersions, such as the fusion method, hot melt extrusion, spray drying, freeze drying and supercritical fluid precipitation, are reviewed in this paper. In addition, the physicochemical characteristics of the obtained solid dispersions are discussed. Expert opinion: Solid dispersions can be successfully prepared by simple fusion, hot melt extrusion, spray drying, freeze drying and supercritical fluid precipitation. Hot melt extrusion, spray drying and freeze drying are processes that can be applied for large scale production. The simple fusion method is not very suitable for large scale production, but is particularly suitable for screening formulations. The most recent method to produce sold dispersions is supercritical fluid precipitation. The process conditions of this method need extensive investigation, in particular in relationship with the selection of the type of carrier and/or solvent. Both processes and formulation aspects strongly affect the characteristics of solid <b>dispersion</b> <b>products.</b> Furthermore, application of crystalline solid dispersions is gaining increasing interest because they are thermodynamically more stable than amorphous solid dispersions...|$|R
