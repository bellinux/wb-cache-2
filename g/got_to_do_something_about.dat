[...] Hubbard's failure to sell Excalibur depressed him; he told his wife in an October 1938 letter: [...] "Writing action pulp doesn't have much agreement with what I want to do because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and, further, actually weakens my name.

5000|$|Following an on-air {{outburst}} about umpire Mark Wegner {{during a}} game on May 30, 2012, Harrelson received a reprimand from MLB commissioner Bud Selig. Harrelson's comments followed Wegner's ejection of White Sox rookie pitcher José Quintana for throwing a pitch behind Ben Zobrist.

[...] Although Harrelson said that such a tirade would not happen again, later in the same season, he lashed out at umpire Lance Barrett following the ejections of A. J. Pierzynski and Robin Ventura. Harrelson stated that [...] "Lance Barrett has just stunk the joint up is all he's done. That's all he's done." [...] He also claimed that [...] "Everything that (Mariners pitcher) Blake Beavan has thrown up there that (catcher Miguel) Olivo has caught has been a strike. If he caught it, it was a strike. He's got two different strike zones. He's got a two-foot for Beavan, and he's got a 10-inch for the White Sox. What does that tell you?" ...|$|E
