40|$|The new European Financial Supervisory Authorities have {{received}} much {{attention in the}} literature, particularly due to their exceptional emergency decision-making powers. By contrast, this article explicitly chooses to focus on these agencies' less explored yet equally crucial role: their (quasi-) rule-making responsibilities. While being less striking at first sight than their emergency counterparts, these rule-making powers are considerable, carry significant consequences, and raise some interesting dilemmas and concerns. This article complements the previous contribution by going at {{a lower level of}} specification and zooming in on a crucial case for studying rule-making by agencies as the Authorities constitute a culmination of agency rule-making powers, as well as agency powers, more broadly. The article will analyse the Authorities' main (quasi-) rule-making powers and the relevant procedures. It will specifically investigate their role with respect to the adoption of regulatory and <b>implementing</b> <b>technical</b> <b>standards,</b> as well as guidelines and recommendations. The article also identifies and highlights a set of problematic issues that arise, threatening to jeopardise the legitimacy and credibility of their rule-making...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{application}} of the Delphi methodology for the identification of future fields of standardisation complemented by a methodological extension by using various science and technology indicators. By the term standardisation, we broadly mean the process of developing and <b>implementing</b> <b>technical</b> <b>standards</b> within a standardisation body. Underlining the explorative nature of this paper, we describe the process of identifying future fields of standardisation. To provide a systematic forecasting view on complex science and technology fields, a combination of quantitative indicator-based analyses and qualitative in-depth Delphi surveys is choosen. Firstly, statistical analyses of suitable indicators are used to identify dynamic developments in such fields. Secondly, to identify detailed challenges for future standardisation, qualitative Delphi surveys are conducted. To collect and evaluate relevant issues the respective expert communities were included. They were identified by using information derived from the science and technology databases used. The paper concludes with the assessment of the chosen approach and give practical insights for its feasibility based on a review of the existing literature on the Delphi methodology. In addition, an outlook for further improvements and other possible fields of application is given...|$|E

40|$|Although {{carp farming}} {{had a key}} role in the Blue Revolution at a global level, European carp {{aquaculture}} has stagnated over the past 25 years without achieving any productivity gains. The objective of this study was to identify the factors and mechanisms constraining production and productivity growth in pond-based carp farming in Hungary, as the country is a good representative of the EU pond-based farming sector. By using data from 44 carp farms, different specifications of the Cobb-Douglas production function were parameterized to investigate the determinants of yields and to assess the extent of economies of scale. Descriptive statistics show that large differences exist in productivity between individual farms, meaning that it is hard to <b>implement</b> <b>technical</b> <b>standards</b> and to ensure repeatability in extensive carp farming technology. Econometric analysis demonstrates that economies of scale do not prevail in pond-based farming in Hungary, so a concentration of farms would not stimulate a growth in carp farming. This may explain the stagnation of carp aquaculture, as the only European aquaculture segments which can grow are those that can exploit economies of scale. Further analysis demonstrates that labour is an important factor of production, and a decreasing workforce may constrain the intensification process of production. On the other hand, mechanisation did not prove to be a significant contributing factor to yields, indicating that large investment in equipment has a limited role in carp farming...|$|R

It can also facilitate commoditization of formerly custom processes.

40|$|So-called “reasonable and nondiscriminatory ” (RAND) {{licensing}} commitments {{have been}} utilized by standards-development organizations (SDOs) {{for years in}} an attempt to alleviate the risk of patent hold-up in standard-setting. These commitments, however, have proven to be vague and offer few assurances to product vendors or patent holders. A recent surge of international litigation concerning RAND commitments has brought this issue to the attention of regulators, industry and the public, and many agree that a better approach is needed. In this paper, I identify seven “first principles ” that underlie the licensing and enforcement of standards-essential patents (SEP) s. These can be summarized as follows: (1) certainty is preferable to uncertainty concerning the cost of <b>implementing</b> a <b>technical</b> <b>standard,</b> (2) there is a meaningful upper limit on reasonable royalty rates, (3) information regarding RAND terms should be available before adoption of a standard, (4) individual RAND commitments must be constrained by the aggregate royalty burden on a standard, (5) non-SEPs need not be bundled with SEPs, (6) SEPs should not be used to block implementation of a standard unless th...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To reexamine the {{changing}} role of echocardiography for primary care evaluation of essential hypertension since the 1993 Canadian Hypertension Society Consensus Conference. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: New recommendations from the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the Canadian Hypertension Society. Recommendations from the American College of Cardiology {{based on a}} prospective, randomized controlled trial of limited echocardiograms. Further results from the Framingham Heart Study and the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study. MAIN MESSAGE: For patients with essential hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) {{continues to be a}} strong predictor of many cardiovascular end points, and echocardiography is a much more sensitive tool for detecting LVH than electrocardiogram (ECG). Although limited echocardiograms are not usually used, they are a less costly method of evaluating LVH than standard echocardiograms and have recently been recommended in the United States to assist in the decision to initiate pharmacotherapy for patients with stage 1 hypertension and no other evidence of target organ damage. Problems with intrareader and interreader variability of results are being addressed by <b>technical</b> and mathematical <b>standards</b> established by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the Canadian Hypertension Society. CONCLUSIONS: Using limited echocardiograms for assessing LVH coupled with <b>implementing</b> Canadian <b>technical</b> <b>standards</b> might lead to a greater role for echocardiography in evaluating essential hypertension in certain patients...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen large-­scale {{litigation}} of standard-­essential patents between companies like Apple, Samsung, Google, Motorola and Microsoft. Such patents are particular because they are, by definition, indispensable to any company wishing to <b>implement</b> a <b>technical</b> <b>standard.</b> Firms that do not own such patents are prepared to spend billions of dollars purchasing them. It is an interesting question how firms obtain such patents in the first place, and to what degree this depends on those firms’ strategies {{at the time of}} standardization. This paper presents an in-­depth investigation on the standardization process of the successful W-­CDMA and LTE standards for mobile telecommunications. We studied the first 77 meetings where these standards took shape, covering a period of over 12 years, and identified the patenting behavior of each of the 939 individual participants attending these meetings, as well as the patenting behavior by non-­participants, together resulting in over 14, 000 patents for this technology. Our data reveals a strong relationship between patent timing and the occurrence of meetings. We observed a remarkable phenomenon that we call ‘just-­in-­ time-­inventions’: the patent intensity of about-­to-­become claimed essential patents is much higher during or just before these meetings than in other periods. At the same time, they are of considerably lower technical value (‘merit’). This suggests that the just-­ in-­time inventions are only beneficial to their owners, whereas for the public they merely invoke unnecessary costs. Finally, we observed that the phenomenon of just-­in-­time inventions is highly concentrated among specific types of firms, above all vertically integrated ones, and the incumbent champions of the previous technology standard. We believe our findings have several implications for standard setting organizations and policy makers alike...|$|R
