500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E
500|$|Time magazine, {{music critic}} Robert Christgau and AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine all {{declared}} the track {{as one of}} CrazySexyCool best. [...] "In many ways, TLC at least musically, were best when {{they were the most}} subtle," [...] commented Complex Michael Arceneaux. In addition, the writer also found the track's content to be [...] "refreshing" [...] for displaying women [...] "muddy up right and wrong in a relationship." [...] From the same publication, Benjamin Chesna and Edwin Ortiz gave credits to the song for making infidelity sound [...] "empowering" [...] while praising Austin's [...] "silky smooth production," [...] concluding their article with a claim: [...] " [...] forced you into the arms of another lady, now you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it on the down low." [...] Slant Magazines editor Sal Cinquemani was reviewing the greatest hits album 20 when he observed that both of the girls' [...] "finest" [...] singles, [...] "Creep" [...] and [...] "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg", had them [...] "proudly flipping accepted modes of female sexual behavior and consent on their heads." [...] To boot the idea, Idolator journalist Robbie Daw explained the song's [...] "staying power" [...] was perhaps owed {{to the fact that it}} was a [...] "provocative" [...] track dared to expose the [...] "taboo, down-low" [...] aspects of a relationship. In the 2014 biopic CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story, [...] "Creep" [...] was served as the backdrop to a dramatic scene where Lopes' character set her then-boyfriend Rison's bathtub filled with tennis shoes on fire and destroyed their joint mansion due to his infidelity. Vibe Clover Hope watched the whole scene and realized how [...] "perfectly sexy and unapologetic" [...] the song was at the time of its first releasing. In contrary, one of Pitchfork contributors, Jess Harvell, felt its lyrics were [...] "unconscionable," [...] instead, he praised the song's groove that was [...] "so seductive you barely register what you're singing along to." [...] Harvell continued to say that Austin even managed to make scratching, [...] "that emblem of noisy hip-hop ruckus", sound [...] "smooth." [...] "No mean feat.," [...] he gave out an endnote. With Charles Aaron's review for Spin, he fictionalized a short story:After that, Aaron also went on to call the track as a whole a [...] "commercial/artistic apex" [...] for the producer. Including it on her list of best tracks that make people dance, Bernadette McNulty from The Telegraph claimed: [...] "The Dallas Austin groove on this is so deep, it might give you vertigo." [...] Ebony writer Michael A. Gonzales agreed, he said the girls' song [...] "put the sonic scientist that much closer to [...] dreams of making tracks as enticing and sexy as the ones his hero Prince created for Vanity 6 and Apollonia 6." [...] Music critic Smokey Fontaine even named the track Austin's best work: [...] "Here, the harmonies worked, the bass line was hard enough to compete in a hip-hop world, and for a moment, R didn't need a guest rapper." ...|$|E

500|$|Root came {{to realise}} {{that while the}} novel's {{narrative}} style allowed Anne's thoughts to come through, the film adaptation offered comparatively little dialogue.

Persuasion was shot in chronological order, which allowed Root to see [...] "what a difference [...] sense of unhappiness can create", as {{by the end of}} the film Anne is [...] "happier and looks better". Root considered the role to be much quieter than her experiences working with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which included her portrayal of Lady Macbeth. The Irish actor Ciarán Hinds, who depicted Frederick Wentworth, commented that Austen [...] "understands a man's heart and how delicate it can be sometimes". He also appreciated that, though Wentworth was a [...] "competent leader of men in his profession", he was [...] "socially inept" [...] in Anne's presence. Susan Fleetwood, the actress who played Lady Russell, had also worked with Michell on The Buddha of Suburbia. She died soon after filming; Persuasion was her last film role.|$|R
5000|$|Blur's {{previous}} studio album, Blur (1997), {{had seen}} the band {{move away from the}} Britpop movement and take on a more Indie rock influenced direction, primarily under the suggestion of guitarist Graham Coxon. The press and the industry had feared that the change in style would not be taken well with the public, and therefore the album would be commercially unsuccessful as a result. Despite these concerns, Blur had become an unexpected success, particularly in America, where the album had been certified Gold. However, the band still wanted to innovate, so they decided to embrace a different sound. Bassist Alex James stated: [...] "I think you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> changing.

2500|$|During late 2014 {{and early}} 2015, the band moved {{recording}} and production over to Montreal, Quebec, at the Golden Ratio Studios, where they worked with Canadian music producer Damian Taylor, {{who had previously}} worked with American rock band The Killers on their 2011 album Battle Born, and as a creative companion to Icelandic musician Björk. An initial version of the album with 13 tracks was tracked {{at the end of}} April 2015, however, the creative process continued when additional songs were written and recorded for the album. Numerous delays pushed the recording and production of the album well into 2015, despite an open declaration early in that year, by Mandagi, that the album would be soon completed. By then, the band had collaborated with European producer Pascal Gabriel, co-writer and producer of various Marina and the Diamonds and Goldfrapp tracks, British songwriter and producer Justin Parker, known for his work with American recording artist Lana Del Rey, and American producer Ben H. Allen, who had previously produced albums for art rock acts Animal Collective and Deerhunter. Ultimately, in October 2015, 32 months after the band started production, amassing over 40 song ideas in the process, the album's production entered the audio mixing phase. Mandagi expressed dissatisfaction with the album's lengthy recording process, though insisted that he and the band were, in contrast, satisfied with the outcome and the final product, stating, [...] "sometimes it was ok, sometimes it was a bit trying but you know nothing good comes easy we <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> at it.

40|$|After 18 {{years as}} a student affairs professional, I am now headed in a {{different}} direction. By {{this time next year}} I will be a first-year student in the master of divinity program at Boston University School of Theology. The personal lessons that I have learned about balance {{over the past two decades}} are very similar to others that appear in this issue, so I will not repeat them here. All the recommendations of the other authors are good ones, and I wish I had learned some of them sooner. Instead of focusing on personal lessons, I offer some structural observations, and- with respect, as I leave the profession- a challenge as well. Every personal story in this issue starts from the assumption that student affairs work simply requires more than most people can give and remain healthy. The hours are long and the work is frequently stressful. Of course, the work is also satisfying and rewarding in other ways, or no one would stick with it. That is "just the way it is " in student affairs, we believe, and any student affairs professional worthy of career advancement will give 110 % to the cause. Make that 150 % in August, October, and April. We all remember times when we <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> going until the work was done, and no matter that we were exhausted. The students deserved our best, and we gave it. The challenge, we assume, is to give ourselves permission to carve out a space within an overlong workweek for personal renewal. Even the summer months do not provide a respite for many of us. A friend of mine once described student affairs work during the fall and spring semesters as "driving down Highway 81 at night in a blinding rainstorm at 85 miles per hour with your headlights off. " Summer is a little better, he said. It is like "driving down Highway 81 at night in a blinding rainstorm at 85 miles per hour with your headlights ON " (G.
