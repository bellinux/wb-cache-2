5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can <b>happen</b> <b>very</b> slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
25|$|Most male {{birds have}} no phallus. In the males of species without a phallus, sperm {{is stored in}} the seminal glomera within the cloacal {{protuberance}} prior to copulation. During copulation, the female moves her tail {{to the side and}} the male either mounts the female from behind or in front (as in the stitchbird), or moves very close to her. The cloacae then touch, so that the sperm can enter the female's reproductive tract. This can <b>happen</b> <b>very</b> fast, sometimes in less than half a second.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} two books {{published}} featuring scripts from As Seen On TV. Up To You, Porky (published in 1985) features scripts from the first series mixed in with extracts from Wood and Walters and Wood's stage show Lucky Bag. In 1987, the follow-up Barmy was published, featuring sketches entirely collated from As Seen On TV. Barmy features a Margery and Joan sketch specially written as {{an introduction to the}} book, where they review forthcoming novels. Also exclusive to this book are two sketches cut from the original broadcast, 'Lady Police Serial', a parody of the long-running Juliet Bravo, where Wood as Juliet chats to her Desk Sergeant Wilberforce. Also, 'Craft Shop', where the owner (Rosalind March) tries to tempt her customer (Celia Imrie) with the likes of [...] "Ukrainian Prayer Shawls, woven by the mothers of Russian dissidents whilst in a state of euphoria, which doesn't <b>happen</b> <b>very</b> often which is why we've only got three." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{a general}} {{principle}} of the law, criminal liability is normally only imposed upon [...] "a blameworthy actor who causes a prohibited harm", and while those who attempt crimes may be blameworthy, {{it can be argued}} that there is no harm caused; attempted burglary, for example, does not lead to anything being stolen. Many theorists who make the distinction between successful and failed attempts do still consider the defendant partially liable, for example advocating a lesser punishment. However, there have been two distinct counterarguments advanced against making such a distinction. The first is that when a crime is attempted, there is a harm, namely a threat to security. Individuals have the right to security, both of themselves and their property, and an attempt to commit a crime infringes on this right. The second is that, regardless of the harm principle, criminal liability for attempts can be justified in utilitarian terms. A person who tries to commit a crime has shown themselves to be dangerous, and must be restrained and rehabilitated to provide a deterrence for them and for others. Although a differing approach is taken in some United States jurisdictions, intervention can <b>happen</b> <b>very</b> early in a conspiracy and the defendants can still be held liable. The earlier the liability, the more controversial.|$|E
500|$|... "The Variable" [...] was the {{hundredth}} {{episode of the}} show to be produced and aired on television. Josh Holloway, who {{plays the role of}} Sawyer, said, [...] "Just statistically speaking, to hit a hundred episodes doesn't <b>happen</b> <b>very</b> often, especially on a show where everyone is saying 'Lost on an island? What are you gonna do after a season or two?', so the fact that we've lasted not only a season or two but flourishing still at this time... it's shocking... it's amazing to me." [...] In an interview with The News & Observer, Lindelof recalled meeting with the ABC executives in 2004 to pitch the idea of a plane crash and survivors stranded on an island full of mystery and danger. When Lindelof was asked by the executives where the Lost saga would stand in the future, he replied, [...] "We're probably not going to get past episode thirteen. Let's all be honest about that up front." [...] Lindelof added that if he had [...] "traveled back in time to tell myself after that meeting {{that we were going to}} make it to a hundred and still have a season beyond that, I would have laughed in my face." [...] The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by the cast and crew on location in Oahu, Hawaii. Duff Goldman and his crew from the Food Network's American television show Ace of Cakes made a special Lost cake for the party to commemorate the milestone. The cake featured replicas of a Dharma beer bottles, the computer from the Swan station, a suitcase and a miniature Oceanic Flight 815. The Ace of Cakes episode ("LOST in Hawaii") featuring the making of the cake aired on the Food Network in the United States on May 9, 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Medieval {{writers such}} as al-Ghazali and William of Ockham {{connected}} the problem with God's absolute power, asking how we can be certain that the world will continue behaving as expected when God could at any moment miraculously cause the opposite.

2500|$|The sonnet {{begins with}} the first eight lines {{an attempt to make}} excuses for the young man's infidelity.

2500|$|The new St Leodegar's Church {{stands on}} the same site as its medieval predecessor, next to the 17th-century manor house in an {{isolated}} position south of the village. Although Victorian restorations of dilapidated ancient churches were very common in Sussex, demolitions and complete reconstructions did not <b>happen</b> <b>very</b> often—although other examples do exist. It is a stone-built church in the Early English Gothic Revival style, with a chancel, aisleless nave, vestry, entrance porch and elaborate bellcote. All windows are lancets. Some old burial vaults survive from the ancient church, but they {{are now in the}} churchyard next to the south nave wall; they were previously in the south aisle, which {{was not included in the}} narrower design of the new church. The bellcote has two bells taken from the old church: one has the initials , and the other is plain. The bellcote has carved gargoyles. [...] The nave and chancel are separated by a tall chancel arch with moulded shafts, and the triple-lancet east window is set in a recessed arch flanked by marble shafts.|$|E
