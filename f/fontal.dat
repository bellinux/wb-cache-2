60|$|There is now no {{reverence for}} any thing; {{and the reason}} is, that men possess conceptions only, and all their {{knowledge}} is conceptional only. Now as, to conceive, {{is a work of}} the mere understanding, and as all that can be conceived may be comprehended, it is impossible that a man should reverence that, to which he must always feel something in himself superior. If it were possible to conceive God in a strict sense, that is, as we conceive a horse or a tree, even God himself could not excite any reverence, though he might excite fear or terror, or perhaps love, as a tiger or a beautiful woman. But reverence, which is the synthesis of love and fear, is only due from man, and, indeed, only excitable in man, towards ideal truths, which are always mysteries to the understanding, {{for the same reason that}} the motion of my finger behind my back is a mystery to you now--your eyes not being made for seeing through my body.

6000|$|I {{retired to}} a cottage in Somersetshire {{at the foot}} of Quantock, and devoted my {{thoughts}} and studies to the foundations of religion and morals. Here I found myself all afloat. Doubts rushed in; broke upon me [...] "from the fountains of the great deep," [...] and fell [...] "from the windows of heaven." [...] The <b>fontal</b> truths of natural religion and the books of Revelation alike contributed to the flood; and it was long ere my ark touched on an Ararat, and rested. The idea of the Supreme Being appeared to me to be as necessarily implied in all particular modes of being as the idea of infinite space in all the geometrical figures by which space is limited. I was pleased with the Cartesian opinion, that the idea of God is distinguished from all other ideas by involving its reality; but I was not wholly satisfied. I began then to ask myself, what proof I had of the outward existence of anything? Of this sheet of paper for instance, as a thing in itself, separate from the phaenomenon or image in my perception. I saw, that in the nature of things such proof is impossible; and that of all modes of being, that are not objects of the senses, the existence is assumed by a logical necessity arising from the constitution of the mind itself,--by the absence of all motive to doubt it, not from any absolute contradiction in the supposition of the contrary. Still the existence of a Being, the ground of all existence, was not yet the existence of a moral creator, and governour. [...] "In the position, that all reality is either contained in the necessary being as an attribute, or exists through him, as its ground, it remains undecided whether the properties of intelligence and will are to be referred to the Supreme Being in the former or only in the latter sense; as inherent attributes, or only as consequences that have existence in other things through him [35]. Were the latter the truth, then notwithstanding all the pre-eminence which must be assigned to the Eternal First from the sufficiency, unity, and independence of his being, as the dread ground of the universe, his nature would yet fall far short of that, which we are bound to comprehend in the idea of GOD. For, without any knowledge or determining resolve of its own, it would only be a blind necessary ground of other things and other spirits; and thus would be distinguished from the FATE of certain ancient philosophers in no respect, but that of being more definitely and intelligibly described." ...|$|E

Its aim is to search relevant faces in large database based on the contents of the images rather than the metadata. It has many applications in important areas such as face searching, forensics, and identification… In this paper, we experimentally evaluate Face Retrieval based on Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and its variants: Rotation Invariant Local Binary Pattern (RILBP) and Pyramid of Local Binary Pattern (PLBP). We also use a grid LBP based operator, which divides an image into 6 × 7 sub-regions then concentrates LBP feature vector from each of them into a spatially enhanced feature histogram. These features were firstly tested on three <b>fontal</b> face datasets: The Database of Faces (TDF), Caltech Faces 1999 (CF 1999) and the combination of The Database of faces and Caltech Faces 1999 (CF). Good result on these dataset has encouraged us to conduct tests on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), where the images were taken from real-world condition. Mean average precision (MAP) was used for measuring the performance of the system. We carry out the experiments in two main stages indexing and searching with the use of k-fold cross-validation.

40|$|La presente investigación aborda la pregunta por la especificidad de la mujer en la obra de Edith Stein. La respuesta se centra en tres núcleos significativos importantes, es decir, la pregunta por el fundamento de la especificidad de la mujer, el método adecuado para abordar dicha especificidad con una racionalidad propiamente teológica y el Gemüt en cuanto elemento constitutivo central de dicha especificidad. En efecto, la especificidad de la mujer encuentra su fundamento último en Dios Trino y Uno en cuanto interrelacionada, de modo analógico, con el Espíritu Santo-Amor. Esta interrelación no excluye la especificidad del varón, -ya que este se encuentra, de modo análogo, prefigurado en el Hijo- sino ambas especificidades se incluyen a partir de sus relaciones opuestas. Esto significa que la especificidad de la mujer no destruye la del varón, sino la realza, de modo análogo al Hijo y al Espíritu, teniendo como origen <b>fontal</b> al Padre, {{principio}} sin principio, al cual nos asemejamos {{por medio de}} nuestro sentir común.

Indeed, the specificity of women finds its ultimate principle in the Triune and One and Only God, such interrelated, as analogical way, with the Holy Spirit-Love. This interrelation does not exclude the specificity of the male, since it is found, similarly, prefigured in the Son - but both specificities are included in its opposite relations.

40|$|Different {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the majority of self-talk during exercise is either positive or neutral in character. The majority of 'thoughts' during low-intensity exercise have been described as being dissociative conversational chatter. However, with increasing exercise intensity, there is a greater percentage of associative and motivational thoughts, which includes thoughts about feeling and affect, body monitoring, command, instruction and pace monitoring. It has been suggested that self-talk is necessary for creating a time 'wedge' between the activity described by the self-talk, and the self-talk itself. The information redundancy created by this time-wedge allows the capacity for reflection about what is occurring, and self-awareness of the part played by the individual themselves in the activity being performed. Self-talk may be a discussion between a singular 'I' and a singular 'me', or may be a multi-party dialogue. There are anatomical correlates to self-talk, with neural activity in a number of brain areas related to the occurrence of both overt and subvocal self-talk, particularly in Broca's region in the left <b>fontal</b> cortex, and Wernicke's region in the left posterior superior temporal cortex. Whether specific training of self-talk can improve performance is controversial, although recent {{studies have suggested}} that task-specific self-talk appears to have a beneficial effect on physical performance.

40|$|When {{multiple}} persons speak simultaneously, it may {{be difficult}} for the listener to direct attention to correct sound objects among conflicting ones. This could occur, for example, in an emergency situation in which one hears conflicting instructions and the loudest, instead of the wisest, voice prevails. Here, we used cortically-constrained oscillatory MEG/EEG estimates to examine how different brain regions, including caudal anterior cingulate (cACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC), work together to resolve these kinds of auditory conflicts. During an auditory flanker interference task, subjects were presented with sound patterns consisting of three different voices, from three different directions (45 ° left, straight ahead, 45 ° right), sounding out either the letters "A" or "O". They were asked to discriminate which sound was presented centrally and ignore the flanking distracters that were phonetically either congruent (50 %) or incongruent (50 %) with the target. Our cortical MEG/EEG oscillatory estimates demonstrated a direct relationship between performance and brain activity, showing that efficient conflict resolution, as measured with reduced conflict-induced RT lags, is predicted by theta/alpha phase coupling between cACC and right lateral frontal cortex regions intersecting the right frontal eye fields (FEF) and DLPFC, as well as by increased pre-stimulus gamma (60 - 110 Hz) power in the left inferior <b>fontal</b> cortex. Notably, cACC connectivity patterns that correlated with behavioral conflict-resolution measures were found during both the pre-stimulus and the pre-response periods. Our data provide evidence that, instead of being only transiently activated upon conflict detection, cACC is involved in sustained engagement of attentional resources required for effective sound object selection performance...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to provide a middle-term radiographic analysis of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with preoperative hypokyphosis treated by posterior arthrodesis with sublaminar bands. This retrospective study included 34 patientswith Lenke 1 scoliosis associated with hypokyphosis (TK < 20 degrees). Aradiographic evaluation was performed with a 2 -year follow-up. Cobb angle, cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, lumbar lordosis, and pelvic parameters were measured preoperatively, postoperatively, and at 6 -month and 2 -year follow-up. The mean preoperative thoracic kyphosis was 10. 5 degrees versus 24. 1 degrees postoperatively (p < 0. 001), representing amean gain of 13 degrees. Cobb angle ranged from 59. 3 degrees to 17. 9 degrees postoperatively (mean correction 69 %, p < 0. 001). Cobb angle increased between the immediate postoperative measurement and the 6 -month follow-up (17. 9 versus 19. 9, p - 0. 03). Cervical curvature changed from a 5. 6 degrees kyphosis to a 3. 5 degrees lordosis (p - 0. 001). Concerning lumbar lordosis, preoperative measurement was 39. 7 degrees versus 41. 3 degrees postoperatively (p = 0. 27). At 6 -month follow-up, lumbar lordosis significantly increased to 43. 6 degrees (p = 0. 03). All parameters were stable at final follow-up. Correction performed by sublaminar bands is efficient for both <b>fontal</b> and sagittal planes. Moreover, the restoration of normal thoracic kyphosis is followed by an adaptation of the adjacent curvatures with improved cervical lordosis and lumbar lordosis...|$|E

All patients had variant forms of frontal sinus anatomy. Surgical techniques will be described and use of the balloon system will be reviewed. All patients (aged 13 – 68 years) successfully underwent <b>fontal</b> sinusotomies with the assistance of a balloon dilation system, which was used in a variety of ways: to dilate the narrow infundibulum of a high intersinus septal cell, to remove an anteriorly located type III frontal sinus cell, to expand the natural frontal ostium in the {{presence of}} excessive agger nasi pneumatization, and to remove a type IV frontal sinus cell. All patients were spared an osteoplastic flap or trephination, and there were no intraoperative complications. No postoperative bleeding, infection, or cerebral spinal fluid leaks were reported.

30|$|A similar cable-driven design concept can be {{followed}} in the lower extremity prostheses design to extend the controllable degrees of freedom (DOFs) beyond state of the art. Currently available ankle-foot prostheses are capable of controlling the ankle joint in only a single DOF in the sagittal plane. These prostheses {{improve the quality of}} life of amputees and are designed to increase mobility. However, turning plays a major role in activities of daily living and account for an average of 25 % of steps, ranging from 8 % to 50 % of all steps depending on the activity [2]. Turning requires modulation of ankle impedance in the sagittal and frontal planes to control lateral and propulsive ground reaction forces in order to accelerate the body center of mass along the gait path, resulting in increased lateral and propulsive impulses when compared to a straight step [3]. As a result, turning strategies for amputees and non-amputees are different. Non-amputees rely on hip movement in the frontal plane and moment generation at the ankle joint, while amputees using passive prostheses rely on hip extension in the sagittal plane to compensate for the lack of forward propulsion from their passive prosthesis [4]-[7]. This data suggests that the next generation of ankle-foot prosthesis can benefit from designs that are capable of functioning in both the frontal and sagittal planes. A cable-driven mechanism seems to be a suitable solution to overcome the weight, size, and profile constraints while introducing a second actuation component. An ankle-foot mechanism capable of impedance modulation and power generation in both the sagittal and <b>fontal</b> planes allows the user to turn in arbitrary directions and walk on slopes that will increase their agility.|$|E
40|$|Different {{hydrophilic}} interaction {{liquid chromatography}} (HILIC) stationary phases {{have been evaluated}} using different chemometric methods {{with the aim of}} their application in metabolomics studies. Experimental factors, such as the type of HILIC stationary phase (i. e. amide, amine, zwitterionic and diol) and the mobile phase conditions (organic co-solvent, pH and ionic strength) were assessed using a full factorial experimental design. A test sample mixture of metabolites with diverse physicochemical properties (amino acids, nucleotides, nucleosides, and sugars among others) was analyzed by liquid chromatography with a diode array detector (LC-DAD) using five different HILIC columns. Application of multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) method, allowed the full chromatographic peak resolution of all mixture constituents. This approach was particularly helpful in the case of methanol samples where the quality of the chromatographic separation (resolution) was lower in consequence of the co-solvent perturbation on the water layer formation at the surface of the stationary phase. Then, Berridge chromatographic response function (CRF), based on peak resolution, retention times and number of peaks, was used for the investigation of the best HILIC column configuration for future metabolomics studies. The best chromatographic configuration resulted in being the amide and zwitterionic HILIC stationary phases in combination with acetonitrile as organic co-solvent of the mobile phase. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

40|$|The right middle <b>fontal</b> gyrus (MFG) {{has been}} {{proposed}} to be a site of convergence of the dorsal and ventral attention networks, by serving as a circuit-breaker, to interrupt ongoing endogenous processes in the dorsal network, and reorienting a person’s attention to an exogenous stimulus. Here, we probed {{the contribution of the}} right MFG to both endogenous and exogenous attention by comparing performance on an orientation discrimination task of a patient with a right MFG resection and a group of healthy controls. On endogenously cued trials, participants were shown a central cue that predicted with 90 % accuracy the location of a subsequent peri-threshold Gabor patch stimulus. On exogenously cued trials, a cue appeared briefly at one of two peripheral locations, followed by a variable inter-stimulus interval (ISI; range 0 to 700 ms) and a Gabor patch in the same or opposite location as the cue. Behavioral data showed that for endogenous, and short ISI exogenous trials, valid cues facilitated faster responses compared to invalid cues, for both the patient and controls. However, at long ISIs, the patient exhibited difficulty in reverting back to top-down attentional control, once the facilitatory effect of the exogenous cue had dissipated. When explicitly cued during long ISIs to attend to both stimulus locations, the patient was able to re-engage successfully in top-down control. This result indicates that the right MFG may {{play an important role in}} reorienting attention from exogenous to endogenous control. Resting state fMRI data revealed that the right superior parietal lobule and right orbitofrontal cortex, showed significantly higher correlations with a left MFG seed region (a region tightly coupled with the resected region in controls) in the patient relative to controls. We hypothesize that this paradoxical increase in cortical coupling represents a compensatory mechanism to offset the loss of function of the resected tissue in right prefrontal cortex...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Dolomite AB was {{in need of}} a {{dummy arm}} for crutch testing, to {{complement}} their existing test capabilities. Background: A large number of people need crutches on a daily basis. For them it is essential that their crutches do not fail. ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) conducts ongoing work to guarantee the durability and function of e. g. crutches. ISO has recently adopted a new standard for testing if elbow crutches. This has already met resistance, it has been claimed that the tests in it should include loading of the crutch in the frontal plane. Aim: To enable Dolomite to test elbow crutches in accordance with guidelines in ISO/FDIS 11334 - 1. And examine the magnitude of loads on a crutch in the horizontal- sagittal- and frontal plane. This to see if loading of the crutch in the <b>fontal</b> plane should be included in a new ISO-test. Goal: To fabricate a dummy arm for testing of elbow crutches. To gain knowledge of the magnitude of the load a crutch is subject to in the horizontal-, sagittal-, and frontal plane. Method: A dummy arm was made using methods and tools described in DPD (dynamic product development), and conventional fabrication methods. A test equipment was made, which registered the loads on a crutch, in three directions. Eleven persons, constituted the test group, one was excluded. Result: A fully functional dummy arm was manufactured. The average maximum load for the ten test subjects was: 33 kilos downwards, 12 kilos backwards and 2 kilos side wards. Discussion: The choice of materials was influenced by the strength demands, ease of manipulation, access and price. Dummy arm design was mostly a question of durability and function. The test group was made up of persons available when the test was done The crutch loading test indicates that the forces applied to a crutch In the frontal plane are small, compared to forces in the horizontal- and sagittal plane, almost negligible. Conclusion: A fully functional dummy arm was fabricated, no need for a new ISO-test for standard crutches was identified...|$|E
40|$|Association rules mining is one {{of several}} ways of {{knowledge}} discovery in databases. Paradoxically, data mining itself can produce such great amounts of association rules that there is a new knowledge management problem: there can easily be thousands or even more association rules holding in a data set. The goal of this work is to design a new method for association rules post-processing. The method should be software and domain independent. The output of the new method should be structured description of the whole set of discovered association rules. The output should help user to work with discovered rules. The path to reach the goal I used is: to split association rules into clusters. Each cluster should contain rules, which are more similar each other than to rules from another cluster. The output of the method is such cluster definition and description. The main contribution of this Ph. D. thesis is the described new Multicriterial clustering association rules method. Secondary contribution is the discussion of already published association rules post-processing methods. The output of the introduced new method are clusters of rules, which cannot be reached by any of former post-processing methods. According user expectations clusters are more relevant and more effective than any former association rules clustering results. The method is based on two orthogonal clustering of the same set of association rules. One clustering is based on interestingness measures (confidence, support, interest, etc.). Second clustering is inspired by document clustering in information retrieval. The representation of rules in vectors like documents is <b>fontal</b> in this thesis. The thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 2 identify the role of association rules in the KDD (knowledge discovery in databases) process, using KDD methodologies (CRISP-DM, SEMMA, GUHA, RAMSYS). Chapter 3 define association rule and introduce characteristics of association rules (including interestingness measuress). Chapter 4 introduce current association rules post-processing methods. Chapter 5 is the introduction to cluster analysis. Chapter 6 is the description of the new Multicriterial clustering association rules method. Chapter 7 consists of several experiments. Chapter 8 discuss possibilities of usage and development of the new method...|$|E
40|$|A palavra mistério, nascida dentro do ambiente cultual grego, entrou na Sagrada Escritura já nas traduções do Antigo Testamento em relação aos termos râz e sôd, respectivamente, em aramaico e hebraico, recebendo assim uma carga semântica teológica dentro das concepções do Povo da primeira Aliança. Por conseguinte, o Novo Testamento, sobretudo as cartas paulinas, faz um abundante uso do termo mistério. Numa linha progressiva de elaboração do conceito de mistério na Sagrada Escritura, ele é a revelação do plano salvífico de Deus Pai em Jesus Cristo através de etapas sucessivas e concatenadas. A teologia patrística, recebendo da tradição bíblica o conceito de mistério, vai desenvolvê-lo quanto as suas mediações no momento eclesial em quatro direções interdependentes: a História Salvífica, a Igreja, a Palavra de Deus e a Liturgia. Na primeira metade do século XX, em virtude do afastamento da teologia das fontes bíblico-patrísticas, o monge beneditino Odo Casel reintroduzirá na reflexão teológico-litúrgico o conceito de mistério, recuperando seu vigor <b>fontal.</b> Esta recuperação, apesar de sofrer uma série de críticas, paulatinamente vai sendo incorporada nos documentos magisteriais. Neste movimento, a Constituição Dogmática Sacrosanctum Concilium é o documento basilar e paradigmático na reintrodução da teologia do mistério pela Igreja. De fato, as intuições mistéricas dos Padres conciliares recolhidas neste documento vão sendo desenvolvidas nas demais Constituições do Concilio Vaticano II, legando a Igreja de hoje uma fecunda herança para repensar sua prática teológico-pastoral. The word mystery has had born {{inside of}} greek cultual {{ambience}} {{and it has}} been introduced by the translators in the Holy Scriptures translations from Old Testament in order to translate the words râz and sôd, respectively, in Aramaic and Hebrew idioms, receiving their semantic charge according to First Alliance People faith. Posteriorly, the New Testament, especially the Pauline letters, used widely the word mystery. In the progressive development inside of the Scripture Text, the concept of mystery means the revelation of the God Father salvation plan by Jesus Christ through successive and concatenated stages. The patristic theology, receiving the concept of mystery from biblical tradition, continued developing it as its interdependent mediations in the ecclesial stage: the History of Salvation, the Church, the Word of God and the Liturgy. In {{the first half of the}} century XX, because of the distance from theology to biblical and patristic sources, the benedictine monk Odo Casel reintroduced the concept the mystery in the theological and liturgical reflections, recovering its source strength. This recovering, in spite of critical positions, little by little, was incorporated by ecclesial works. In this incorporation, the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy is the primary and paradigmatic work at reintroducing of the theology of the mystery by the Church. Indeed, council Fathers mysterical insights, written in the Sacrosanctum Concilium, developed on the others Constitution from the Vatican Council II, providing the current church a rich heritage in order to criticize its theological and pastoral practices...|$|E
