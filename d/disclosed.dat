40|$|Background: Though the {{prevalence}} of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) remains high in less developed countries, data suggest that these figures may represent an underestimation considering that many women are unwilling to <b>disclose</b> abuse. This paper aims to determine women’s willingness to report abuse, factors determining willingness to <b>disclose</b> IPV, and to whom such disclosure is made. Methods: A total of 911 women visiting reproductive health facility responded to the questionnaire, and the collected data was analyzed using multivariate analysis. Results: About 54 % (n= 443) of the participating women reported that would not <b>disclose</b> IPV. Among those willing to <b>disclose</b> abuse, 68 % (n= 221) would opt to <b>disclose</b> to close relatives in contrast to 37 % (n= 103) who would <b>disclose</b> {{to some form of}} institutions (i. e. religious leaders, law enforcement officers).
