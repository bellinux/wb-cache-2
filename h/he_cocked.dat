2500|$|Thompson {{died from}} a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at Owl Farm, his [...] "fortified compound" [...] in Woody Creek, Colorado, at 5:42p.m. on February 20, 2005. His son Juan, daughter-in-law Jennifer, and {{grandson}} were visiting for the weekend. His wife Anita, {{who was at the}} Aspen Club, {{was on the phone with}} him as <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> the gun. According to the Aspen Daily News, Thompson asked her to come home to help him write his ESPN column, then set the receiver on the counter. Anita said she mistook the cocking of the gun for the sound of his typewriter keys and hung up as he fired. Will and Jennifer were in the next room when they heard the gunshot, but mistook the sound for a book falling and did not check on Thompson immediately. Juan Thompson found his father's body. According to the police report and Anita's cell phone records, he called the sheriff's department half an hour later, then walked outside and fired three shotgun blasts into the air to [...] "mark the passing of his father". The police report stated that in Thompson's typewriter was a piece of paper with the date “Feb. 22 ‘05” and a single word, [...] "counselor".|$|E
2500|$|Early revolvers were caplocks {{and loaded}} as a muzzle-loader: the user poured black powder into each chamber, rammed down a bullet {{on top of}} it, then placed {{percussion}} caps on the nipple {{at the rear of}} each chamber, where the hammer would fall on it. This was similar to loading a traditional single-shot muzzle-loading pistol, except that the powder and shot could be loaded directly into the front of the cylinder rather than having to be loaded down the whole length of the barrel. Importantly, this allowed the barrel itself to be rifled, since the user wasn't required to force the tight fitting bullet down the barrel in order to load it (a traditional muzzle-loading pistol had a smoothbore and relatively loose fitting shot, which allowed easy loading, but gave much less accuracy). When firing the next shot, the user would raise his pistol vertically as <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> the hammer back so as to let the fragments of the burst percussion cap fall out so as to not jam the mechanism. Some of the most popular cap-and-ball revolvers were the Colt Model 1851 [...] "Navy" [...] Model, 1860 [...] "Army" [...] Model, and Colt Pocket Percussion revolvers, all of which saw extensive use in the American Civil War. Although American revolvers were the most common, European arms makers were making numerous revolvers by that time as well, many of which found their way {{into the hands of the}} American forces, including the single action Lefaucheux and LeMat revolver and the Beaumont–Adams and Tranter revolvers, which were early double-action weapons, in spite of being muzzle-loaders.|$|E
6000|$|He was basking {{at the top}} of {{the water}} one hot day in July, {{catching}} duns and feeding the trout, when he saw a new sort, a dark gray little fellow with a brown head. He was a very little fellow indeed: but he made the most of himself, as people ought to do. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> up his head, and <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> up his wings, and <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> up his tail, and <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> up the two whisks at his tail-end, and, in short, he looked the cockiest little man of all little men. And so he proved to be; for instead of getting away, he hopped upon Tom's finger, and sat there as bold as nine tailors; and he cried out in the tiniest, shrillest, squeakiest little voice you ever heard, ...|$|E

6000|$|Once more {{he spread}} his black wings and flew down to the egg. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> {{his head to one}} side and looked at it. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> his head to the other side and looked at it. He walked all around it, chuckling and saying to himself, [...] "Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty and all mine, mine, mine, mine! Pretty, pretty, and all mine!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> {{his nose}} in the air loftily and stepped across the narrow field-borders with great dignity.|$|E
6000|$|... "We must {{surprise}} him if we can," [...] said Curtis to Crow. [...] "We must not shoot. I {{will talk to}} him. If <b>he</b> <b>cocks</b> his gun kill him; but I don't think he will want to fight." ...|$|R

6000|$|Ovid's eyes {{followed}} her compassionately. [...] "Poor wretch!" [...] he thought. [...] "What an infernal temper, {{and how hard}} she tries to control it!" [...] He joined Carmina, with a new delight in being near her again. Zo was still in ecstasies over the Piping Crow. [...] "Oh, the jolly little chap! Look how <b>he</b> <b>cocks</b> his head! <b>He</b> mocks me when I whistle. Buy him," [...] cried Zo, tugging at Ovid's coat tails in the excitement that possessed her; [...] "buy him, and let me take him home with me!" ...|$|R

5000|$|When {{he gets to}} Houston, Cohen is cornered on {{the highway}} {{by the police and}} {{considers}} shooting Travis, but the boy lets him know that he can't do it and they both know it. Cohen collides with a roadblock in his last attempt to escape. When the car breaks down, he is totally surrounded. Holding Travis close to him, <b>he</b> <b>cocks</b> his gun, and asks him: [...] "How old are you, kid"? Travis answers [...] "nine". While looking up, Cohen says: [...] "Nine, huh? How about that?" [...] and shoots himself through the throat, dying instantly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will put}} my hand in the fire for Mr. Balfour," [...] says Alan. [...] "He is an honest and a mettle gentleman, and I would have ye bear in mind who says it. I bear a king's name," [...] says <b>he,</b> <b>cocking</b> his hat; [...] "and I and any that I call friend are company for the best. But the gentleman is tired, and should sleep; if he has no mind to the cartes, it will never hinder you and me. And I'm fit and willing, sir, to play ye any game that ye can name." ...|$|R

50|$|Tum {{decides to}} get rid of their bodies, get a plane ticket, obtain a fake {{passport}} and visa, take the noodle box with her and go spend {{the rest of her life}} somewhere else.

More men sent by a Muay Thai promoter appears at Tum's apartment, where one quickly hid in her wardrobe when she returned home. A young policeman, who is the lover of her nosy neighbor, Pen, suddenly calls on her and discovers the bodies.

5000|$|A. O. Scott, in {{his review}} for The New York Times, had {{problems}} with Phoenix's performance: [...] "Even though his singing voice doesn't match the original - how could it? - he is most convincing in concert, when his shoulders tighten and <b>he</b> <b>cocks</b> {{his head to one}} side. Otherwise, he seems stuck in the kind of off-the-rack psychological straitjacket in which Hollywood likes to confine troubled geniuses". In his review for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "A lot of credit for Phoenix's performance has to go to Mangold, who has always been good at finding the bleak melodrama in taciturn souls ... If Mangold's new movie has a problem, it's that he and co-screenwriter Gill Dennis sometimes walk the lines of the inspirational biography too rigorously".|$|R
60|$|The acuteness and the {{significance}} of the Captain's eye as <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> it in reply, no words short of those unutterable Chinese words before referred to could describe.|$|E
60|$|He {{thought and}} he thought {{and he thought}} and he thought, and little by little a plan worked out in his little black head. Then he chuckled. He chuckled right out loud, then hurriedly looked {{around to see if}} any one had heard him. No one had, so he chuckled again. <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> his head on one side and half closed his eyes, as if that plan was {{something}} he could see and he was looking at it very hard. Then <b>he</b> <b>cocked</b> his head {{on the other side and}} did the same thing.|$|E
6000|$|Hawe was spitefully {{ejecting}} a wad {{of tobacco}} from his mouth and swearing in an undertone about [...] "white-livered Greasers." [...] <b>He</b> <b>cocked</b> his red eye speculatively at Stewart.|$|E
60|$|By {{that time}} it was long past noon, and the hunter was meditating the propriety of going to a {{neighbouring}} height to view the surrounding country, when a slight noise attracted his attention. <b>He</b> started, <b>cocked</b> his gun, glared round in all directions, and held his breath.|$|R

40|$|When Tre rolls {{through the}} L.

The traffic may be the only thing we recognize about this Los Angeles. In the overgrown parks along the freeways, guerillas smoke joints, resting off their last bombing mission. Barefooted kids flit over dirt roads, from barrio to barrio, and spread the gossip like carrier pigeons. “Did you hear who the soldiers kidnapped last night?” And Tre has no way of knowing, as <b>he</b> <b>cocks</b> back the hammer, that the man behind the tinted window of this car is not just another target, it’s his father. The Los Angeles in Plata o Plomo is more like Medellín in Escobar’s days, than any L. A. we would ever hope to kno...|$|R
