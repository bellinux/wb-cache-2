Upon her return in 2008, the character had altered and matured. Lawrence has commented, [...] "coming back, she seems quite nice actually, she seem more relaxed. She's so much older <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>so</b> she's sort of grown up really. She seems nice and kind and settled with her life." ...|$|E

60|$|NORA [not doubting {{that the}} {{associations}} are with her]. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, however, he had disappeared--down a thick green alley to the left, <b>I</b> <b>supposed.</b> <b>So</b> <b>I</b> {{went forward}} by a clearer path, and when I had {{advanced}} a few paces, met {{face to face}} a lady whose dark eyes seemed strangely familiar to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well--you are not nice--too sermony. Though <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> am <b>so</b> bad and {{worthless}} that I {{deserve the}} utmost rigour of lecturing!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Now {{there was}} that in Kari's tone which in my weak state angered me. Why did he scold me about faith? Why did he address me as [...] "White Man" [...] instead of [...] "Master"? Was it because he had reached a country where he was great and I was nothing? <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>so,</b> and answered; ...|$|R
60|$|BLOOM: (With precaution) <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so,</b> father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.|$|E
60|$|STEPHEN [reluctantly] <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so,</b> if {{the girls}} cannot do without his money.|$|E
60|$|MARGARET. My aunt! <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so.</b> I havent {{seen her}} for a month.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good gracious,' said Teddy's mother, 'and that's a wild creature! <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> he's <b>so</b> tame because we've {{been kind}} to him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good gracious," [...] said Teddy's mother, [...] "and that's a wild creature! <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> he's <b>so</b> tame because we've {{been kind}} to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pay {{her back}} the twenty dollars she paid for it, <b>I</b> <b>suppose.</b> I'm <b>so</b> thankful it wasn't a {{cherished}} heirloom because then no money could replace it." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. COADE (placidly). <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so.</b> I {{have been}} down {{several times to}} look for him.|$|E
60|$|A. Ah! well, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so.</b> We {{never could}} tell. There {{was a great}} mystery about it.|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT [saddened]. Ah yes, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so.</b> [With feeling, severely] Larry: you've treated {{that poor}} girl disgracefully.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am growing old, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> suspect every one. But hearken to me, {{for between}} wine and ill-temper out it must come. You saw that Alruna-woman?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The rogue," [...] said he. [...] "The {{moment that}} I am gone, {{he will go}} to gnawing again, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> and <b>so</b> get out and run away. What a little fool he is." ...|$|R
60|$|CONJURER. Killed a policeman? How Vegetarian! Well, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> it was, <b>so</b> {{long as they}} didn't eat him.|$|R
60|$|MAZZINI. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so.</b> I do hope he'll {{wake up in}} {{the course}} of the night. [He goes out into the garden].|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so,</b> and yet I {{assure you}} {{it is not}} a mere matter of {{sentiment}} with me. Other questions might turn upon it." ...|$|E
60|$|ROSE. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so,</b> else he wouldn't {{treat me}} as he's done. He's after that--that--He didn't ought {{to treat me}} as if I was dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course. <b>I</b> know. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> that's <b>so.</b> Honestly, <b>I</b> do love children. But there's lots {{of women}} that can do housework, but I--well, if you HAVE got a college education, you ought {{to use it for}} the world." ...|$|R
60|$|In this dismal way was a {{creature}} of feeling and fancy brought up. Every thing genial and amiable in my nature was repressed and nothing brought out but what was unprofitable and ungracious. I was ardent in my temperament; quick, mercurial, impetuous, formed to be {{a creature}} all love and adoration; but a leaden hand was laid on all my finer qualities. I was taught nothing but fear and hatred. I hated my uncle, I hated the monks, I hated the convent in which I was immured. I hated the world, and I almost hated myself, for being, as <b>I</b> <b>supposed,</b> <b>so</b> hating and hateful an animal.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I {{knew you}} would put right and duty first; and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> by doing <b>so</b> you make it certain to end rightly, one way or other.' ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the last}} two names the girl looked vague, but she said: [...] "Oh yes, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so.</b> And I suppose you like the old dramatists?" ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so.</b> Mr. Mackenzie {{will have}} given the shippers all directions. You'd better bring the tea at once. Mrs. Crowley is coming at four.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so.</b> Well, she is right. As {{the world}} goes in Prague, my child, you will degrade {{yourself}} by marrying a Jew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'T {{is natural}} {{you should feel}} this consarn for your own parent, Judith, and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> it's equally <b>so</b> that you should feel it for Hurry Harry, too." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I dont rehearse, but I do research. If Ive got {{an author}} on, Ill always read the book. I think thats the {{least you can}} do rather than just reading the {{researchers}} notes. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> do <b>so</b> much research because I really love television. Thats why I work in it. Im passionate about it and I always have been." [...] Paul OGrady, on the show ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{young men}} <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> equally <b>so.</b> Life {{ought to be}} a life of self-denial, no doubt. Perhaps it might be my duty to retire from this affair, if by doing so I should {{sacrifice}} only myself. The one person of whom I am bound to think in this matter is the girl I love." ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS T. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so.</b> How {{does one}} manage to dance through one's heels first? Look at this--isn't it shameful? (Spreads stocking-heel on open hand for inspection) ...|$|E
60|$|COADE (blinking). Old? Yes, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so.</b> But it is {{the same}} soft, lovable face, and the same kind, beaming smile that {{children}} could warm their hands at.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, yes; <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>so.</b> Ah me! ah me! But, Dr Thorne, {{there must}} be some chance--isn't there any chance? That man says he's going on so well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only a drap o' drink {{got into}} his head," [...] said the tranter. [...] "Man's well enough when he's in his {{religious}} frame. He's in his worldly frame now. Must ask en to our bit of a party to-morrow night, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> and <b>so</b> put en in humour again. We bear no mortal man ill-will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Agatha, you are strangely pale! What has happened? I {{have not}} had time yet to {{question}} Edgar, and, indeed, have been talking so fast myself {{that he has had}} no chance of explaining how you and Aline managed to get here. You came by water, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> and <b>so</b> escaped that crowd of knaves round the Tower?" ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, I think I {{love him}} merely {{because he is}} MINE and is MASCULINE. There is no other reason, <b>I</b> <b>suppose.</b> And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> think it is as I first said: {{that this kind of}} love is not a product of reasonings and statistics. It just COMES--none knows whence--and cannot explain itself. And doesn't need to.|$|R
