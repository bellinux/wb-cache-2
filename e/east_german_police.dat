25|$|As commandant of the American {{sector of}} Berlin from June 4, 1957 to December 15, 1959, Hamlett {{commanded}} a 4,000-man garrison {{in the southwest}} corner of West Berlin and was deputy chief of mission to Ambassador David K.E. Bruce in Bonn. His tour coincided with the 1958 Berlin crisis, which began when Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev issued an ultimatum demanding that the occupation of Berlin be terminated within six months. Tensions escalated as the Soviets began interfering with Western access to Berlin by detaining U.S. convoys on the autobahn for hours. In January 1959, Hamlett's own wife was halted by <b>East</b> <b>German</b> <b>police</b> while being driven in a U.S. Army car from East Berlin to West Berlin. The Western Allies presented a unified diplomatic and military front and the deadline passed without incident.|$|E
500|$|From 1945 onwards, {{unauthorised}} crossers of {{the inner}} German border risked being shot by Soviet or East German guards. The use of deadly force was termed the Schießbefehl ("order to fire" [...] or [...] "command to shoot"). It was formally in force as early as 1948, when regulations concerning the use of firearms on the border were promulgated. A regulation issued to <b>East</b> <b>German</b> <b>police</b> on 27May 1952 stipulated that [...] "failure to obey the orders of the Border Patrol will be met {{by the use of}} arms". From the 1960s through {{to the end of the}} 1980s, the border guards were given daily verbal orders (Vergatterung) to [...] "track down, arrest or annihilate violators". The GDR formally codified its regulations on the use of deadly force in March 1982, when the State Border Law mandated that firearms were to be used as the [...] "maximum measure in the use of force" [...] against individuals who [...] "publicly attempt to break through the state border".|$|E

2500|$|With Stalin dead, the KGB chief [...] Lavrenti Beria jockeyed {{for power}} in the Kremlin, putting forth the goal of German reunification. His plan was {{to set up a}} workers' {{demonstration}} that would allow the Kremlin to remove hardliner Walter Ulbricht and begin a program of economic concessions to the workers. The plan failed when the demonstrations assumed a mass character. [...] The strike against poor wages and working conditions overnight became a workers' revolution for democratic rights. On 17 June, Soviet tanks had to restore order. This failure delayed German unification and contributed to the fall of Beria. [...] It started when 60 construction workers building the showpiece Stalin-Allee in East Berlin went on strike on 16 June 1953, to demand a reduction in recent work-quota increases. They called for a general strike the next day, 17 June. The general strike and protest marches turned into rioting and spread throughout East Germany. The <b>East</b> <b>German</b> <b>police</b> failed to quell the unrest. It had to be suppressed by Soviet troops, who encountered stiff resistance from angry crowds across East Germany, and responded with live ammunition. At least 153 people were killed in the suppression of the uprising.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{appropriately}} for a cold war, {{the relationship}} between the East and West German border guards and officials was frosty. As a Bayerische Grenzpolizei report of 1968 noted, [...] "the conduct of the Soviet zone [...] border troops continued unfriendly and uncooperative. Officers and officials only sought contact to obtain information about refugees or to influence the border population with their propaganda." [...] There was very little official face-to-face interaction between the two sides on the ground, as the East German border guards were under orders not to speak to Westerners. Klaus Grünzner, a former West German border guard, later recalled: [...] "I served ... for eight years and the <b>East</b> <b>German</b> <b>police</b> never said a single word to us, except in 1974 during the World Cup, when East Germany beat us. One of the guards shouted at us: 'Sparwasser [...] really socked it to you!'" [...] After the initiation of détente between East and West Germany in the 1970s, the two sides established procedures for maintaining formal contacts through fourteen direct telephone connections or Grenzinformationspunkt (GIP, [...] "border information point"). They were used to resolve local problems affecting the border, such as floods, forest fires or stray animals.|$|E

He was promoted to the rank of major general within the service in October 1952. More importantly, between 1952 and 1957 he served as chief of the German Democratic Republic's [...] "Verwaltung für Allgemeine Fragen und Aufklärung". English-language sources sometimes translate this as [...] "Military Intelligence Service" [...] although until 1956 East Germany was not permitted an army of its own. Linke enjoyed the full confidence of the country's Soviet sponsors and his time in charge saw early successes for the service which was well supported by the political establishment. [...] There was a move from Pankow to new premises in central Berlin (Behrenstraße 42-45) and in 1956 a change of name to [...] "Verwaltung 19" [...] ("Administration [...] 19") apparently in order to conceal {{the true nature of the}} organisation.|$|E
