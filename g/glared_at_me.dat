500|$|The adult defendants, {{facing the}} death penalty, portrayed {{themselves}} at trial as unwilling {{participants in the}} conspiracy. [...] The examination of defendant Veljko Cubrilović (who helped coordinate the transport of the weapons and was a Narodna Odbrana agent) is illustrative of this effort. Cubrilović stated to the court: [...] "Princip <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and very forcefully said 'If you want to know, it is for that reason {{and we are going}} to carry out an assassination of the Heir and if you know about it, you have to be quiet. If you betray it, you and your family will be destroyed.'" [...] Under questioning by defense counsel Cubrilović described in more detail the basis of the fears that he said had compelled him to cooperate with Princip and Grabež." [...] Cubrilović explained that he was afraid a revolutionary organization capable of committing great atrocities stood behind Princip and that he therefore feared his house would be destroyed and his family killed if he did not comply and explained that he knew such an organization existed in Serbia, at least at one time. When pressed for why he risked the punishment of the law, and did not take the protection of the law against these threats he responded: [...] "I was more afraid of terror than the law." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{stood looking}} at the school— it looked so big! Just then the guards let some white {{students}} through. The crowd was quiet. I guess they were {{waiting to see what}} was going to happen. When I was able to steady my knees, I walked up to the guard who had let the white students in. He didn’t move. When I tried to squeeze past him, he raised his bayonet and then the other guards moved in and they raised their bayonets. They <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a mean look and I was very frightened and didn’t know what to do. I turned around and the crowd came toward me. They moved closer and closer. Somebody started yelling, [...] "Drag her over this tree! Let's take care of that nigger!'" ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{a moment}} in furious amazement. Then {{he turned to his}} officers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, no, not if {{you come}} as a friend! But when you stand and <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> comme cela, what do you expect? Nothing very cordial, surely!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{did you try}} to run away?" [...] {{said the}} Fortune, when his struggles had ceased and his screams were stilled. [...] "Why do you <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> so inhospitably?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Odd!" [...] said Graham. [...] "Guardian? Council?" [...] Then {{turning his}} back on the new comer, he asked in an undertone, [...] "Why is this man <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me?</b> Is he a mesmerist?" ...|$|R
60|$|The little lawyer <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a moment, {{and then}} the belligerence faded out of his face.|$|E
60|$|The {{merchant}} gave {{a cry of}} astonishment, nay, horror. He turned {{pale and}} <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> fiercely.|$|E
60|$|She <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> By {{this time}} I was pure jelly. I simply flowed about the chair.|$|E
60|$|And {{here the}} gallant gentleman {{attempted}} to rise, but his legs refused to assist him, and, tumbling {{back against the}} wall, he was only able to <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> out of his watery eyes.|$|R
60|$|As I rose {{to my feet}} {{the first}} thing I saw was the {{malignant}} countenance of Issus <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> through the heavy bars of a grated door at {{one side of the}} chamber.|$|R
60|$|He {{continued}} to <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{but for a}} moment made no movement, probably because he knew not what to do next. I watched him very much as a mouse may watch a cat.|$|R
60|$|Grosse's eyes <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{through his}} {{spectacles}} with a dignity and gravity worthy of Mr. Finch himself.|$|E
60|$|I {{stepped back}} into the little hall. They were talking {{together}} earnestly. Arthur looked up and <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|He <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I nodded {{slightly}} and murmured that doubtless {{there was much}} subtle truth in his view.|$|E
6000|$|... "Britain hasn't got an army," [...] said Mrs. Norman emphatically. [...] "You needn't <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> Norman. <b>Glaring</b> won't make {{soldiers}} out {{of timothy}} stalks. A hundred thousand men {{will just be}} a mouthful for Germany's millions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your enemies {{might find}} some harsher name for it," [...] said Astley with a sneer. [...] "Nay, {{you need not}} think to scare <b>me</b> by <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> Sir Robert, nor will your ill-pleasure change my thoughts. I have faced fiercer eyes than thine, and I have not feared." ...|$|R
60|$|There he hung {{helpless}} for a moment, <b>glaring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in impotent rage.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Stillwell <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> If {{he could}} have eaten me up I believe {{he would have done}} so.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned and}} <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> some devilish retort {{on his lips}} which he held back. Suddenly he became suave.|$|E
60|$|And then Goodloe Banks went as wild as his {{education}} permitted. He dropped the glasses off {{his nose and}} <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell you!" [...] he said, <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "When I {{first saw}} {{you it was}} too late to tell you. I thought the kindest thing I could do was to hold my tongue and let you get away in happy ignorance. This will teach you to take a man's house by storm, madam!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can I, when he jes' sets an' <b>glares</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> ev'ry time {{he comes}} into the house--'cept when he {{complains}} I ain't doin' my work proper? It were a sort o' mean trick o' yours, Marm, leavin' me here to slave fer that ol' man while you was off in the cities, havin' a good time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Adams," [...] he replied, <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{through his}} smoked spectacles, [...] "If you {{talk like that}} we shall quarrel. Maqueda change her mind indeed! Why, it {{is an insult to}} suggest such a thing, and if you take my advice you won't let Oliver hear you. Don't you remember, man, that she's in love with him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Brown <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in {{unaffected}} surprise; and {{for as much}} as {{a moment}} he was entirely speechless; then he shouted to me-- ...|$|E
60|$|Had I {{slapped the}} {{merchant}} {{in the face}} {{he would not have}} been more surprised. He sprang to his feet and <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|He <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> like a basilisk. “And {{why have}} I been met like this?” he enquired {{with an air}} of being {{prepared}} to hear a lie.|$|E
60|$|I {{continued}} rapping with my knuckles, {{and he came}} to the wicket to <b>glare</b> in <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Expressing similar sentiments, an {{aspiring}} young model {{was quoted as}} saying, [...] "Deep down I {{still want to be}} a supermodel... As long as they're there, screaming <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from the television, <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from the magazines, I'm stuck in the model trap. Hate them first. Then grow to like them. Love them. Emulate them. Die to be them. All the while praying the cycle will come to an end." ...|$|R
5000|$|Anne Gunning limited {{herself to}} {{photographic}} modelling, despite requests from designers like Coco Chanel to {{be a part}} of their stage shows. She did only one fashion show - for Sybil Connolly - as a favour. She was afraid of falling down on the stage, and remarked, [...] "that sea of faces <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> was too daunting." [...] She died in 1990.|$|R
60|$|Now Umslopogaas {{lifted the}} axe Groan-Maker {{as though he}} would cut me down, then let it fall again, while Galazi the Wolf <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with wide-opened eyes.|$|E
60|$|He {{leaned forward}} till his white locks almost seemed {{to mingle with}} the thin flame, through which he <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with eyes that were fiercer than the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't say {{anything}} about that. But 'tain't enough." [...] He <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Holtzmann said he'd pay me a hundred dollars. Yes, sir, ten {{times as much as}} you." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{jumped to}} his feet with a cry, and stood <b>glaring</b> down <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a gleam in his eyes which was {{positively}} murderous.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Banville {{was awarded}} the Franz Kafka Prize. Marcel Reich-Ranicki and John Calder {{featured}} on the jury. Banville described the award as [...] "one of the ones one really wants to get. It's an old style prize and as an old codger it's perfect for me ... I've been wrestling with Kafka since I was an adolescent" [...] and said his bronze statuette trophy [...] "will <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from the mantelpiece".|$|R
60|$|He {{had grown}} very much excited; {{and it was}} as though this {{excitement}} suddenly revealed to me {{the full extent of the}} change that had taken place in him since he had left college. As he stood facing <b>me,</b> almost <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> through his eye-glasses, I beheld a slim, nervous, fault-finding doctrinaire, incapable of understanding the world as it was, lacking the force of his pioneer forefathers. I rather pitied him.|$|R
