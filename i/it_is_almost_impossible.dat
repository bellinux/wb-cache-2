5|$|A {{medical report}} {{documented}} that wearing an underwire bra in the Tropics, specifically East Africa, {{can lead to}} severe furuncular myiasis of the breast caused by the Tumbu fly. The eggs and larvae from this fly are deposited in clothing, especially {{along the length of}} the metal wires of an underwire bra, and can only be killed by applying heat through ironing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> when ironing a traditional underwire bra to achieve the required heat to kill the larvae deposited along the underwire.|$|E
5|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{is the notion}} that a transitional form between two different taxonomic groups must be a direct ancestor of one or both groups. The difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that {{one of the goals of}} evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to be sure that any form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. In fact, because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, it is unlikely that any particular form represented in the fossil record is a direct ancestor of any other. Cladistics deemphasizes the concept of one taxonomic group being an ancestor of another, and instead emphasizes the identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with one another than they do with other groups. There are a few exceptional cases, such as some marine plankton microfossils, where the fossil record is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species. But, in general, transitional fossils are considered to have features that illustrate the transitional anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa, rather than to be actual ancestors.|$|E

25|$|One {{point that}} the French had a major problem with was the concept of sanctuary.

In the early 1950s, southern China was used as a sanctuary by Viet Minh guerrillas. Several hit and run ambushes were successfully operated against French Union convoys along the neighboring Route Coloniale 4 (RC 4), which was a major supply way in Tonkin (northern Vietnam). One of the most famous attacks of this kind was the battle of Cao Bằng.|$|E

25|$|The {{transformation}} of biomass into charcoal produces {{a series of}} charcoal derivatives known as pyrogenic or black carbon, the composition of which varies from lightly charred organic matter, to soot particles rich in graphite formed by recomposition of free radicals. Here, all types of carbonized materials are called charcoal. By convention, charcoal {{is considered to be}} any natural organic matter transformed thermally or by a dehydration reaction with an Oxygen/Carbon (O/C) ratio less than 60 smaller values have been suggested. Because of possible interactions with minerals and organic matter from the soil, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to identify charcoal with any certainty by determining only the proportion of O/C. The Hydrogen/Carbon percentage or molecular markers such as benzenepolycarboxylic acid, are therefore used as a second level of identification.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the great}} and growing modern city stands {{immediately}} over the ancient one, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. Cleopatra VII's royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual subsidence in the 4th century AD. This underwater section, containing {{many of the most}} interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team. It raised a noted head of Caesarion. These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy. The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman strata.|$|E
25|$|First Jackson {{argued that}} qualia are epiphenomenal: not causally efficacious {{with respect to}} the {{physical}} world. Jackson does not give a positive justification for this claim—rather, he seems to assert it simply because it defends qualia against the classic problem of dualism. Our natural assumption would be that qualia must be causally efficacious in the physical world, but some would ask how we could argue for their existence if they did not affect our brains. If qualia are to be non-physical properties (which they must be in order to constitute an argument against physicalism), some argue that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to imagine how they could have a causal effect on the physical world. By redefining qualia as epiphenomenal, Jackson attempts to protect them from the demand of playing a causal role.|$|E

25|$|There is no precise {{measurement}} {{of the costs of}} regulation balanced against the harms associated with money laundering, and given the evaluation problems involved in assessing such an issue, {{it is unlikely that the}} effectiveness of terror finance and money laundering laws could be determined with any degree of accuracy. The Economist estimated the annual costs of anti-money laundering efforts in Europe and North America at US$5 billion in 2003, an increase from US$700 million in 2000. Government-linked economists have noted the significant negative effects of money laundering on economic development, including undermining domestic capital formation, depressing growth, and diverting capital away from development. Because of the intrinsic uncertainties of the amount of money laundered, changes in the amount of money laundered, and the cost of anti-money laundering systems, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to tell which anti-money laundering systems work and which are more or less cost effective.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} many {{contributing}} factors and risks associated with strokes, {{there are very few}} associated with Dejerine–Roussy syndrome and thalamic lesions specifically. In general, strokes damage one hemisphere of the brain, which can include the thalamus. The thalamus is generally believed to relay sensory information between a variety of subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. It is known that sensory information from environmental stimuli travels to the thalamus for processing and then to the somatosensory cortex for interpretation. The final product of this communication is the ability to see, hear or feel something as interpreted by the brain. Dejerine–Roussy syndrome most often compromises tactile sensation. Therefore, the damage in the thalamus causes miscommunication between the afferent pathway and the cortex of the brain, changing what or how one feels. The change could be an incorrect sensation experienced, or inappropriate amplification or dulling of a sensation. Because the brain is considered plastic and each individual's brain is different, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to know how a sensation will be changed without brain mapping and individual consultation.|$|E
25|$|How far these snakes {{can strike}} has been controversial. Obviously this {{depends on the}} size of the animal, but other factors may also play a role, such as the species, the {{position}} of the body, and the degree of excitement. Additionally, the question of definition exists: from which point on the snake should a strike be measured: from the front, the middle, or the back of the anchor coil on the ground? Even if the length of the specimen is known, once it strikes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to determine the limiting point reached by its head and the position of its body when the movement started. Therefore, it is not surprising that many conflicting statements can be found in the available literature about how far these snakes can strike. Estimates have been given that range from one-third of the body length, to half, three-quarters or even the full length of the animal. They rarely strike further than half of their body length, and almost never more than three-fourths, but that it is still not wise to trust such values if only because it is not possible to accurately judge the length of a coiled snake.|$|E
