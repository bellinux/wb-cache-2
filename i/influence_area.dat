40|$|Currently the Arctic is {{severely}} affected by global warming. Summer minimum sea ice extent is shrinking and estimates of sea ice thickness also indicate a rapid decrease. Whether such changing sea ice conditions affect biodiversity and functioning of bacterial communities from sea ice, melt pools, and surface water was studied during a summer expedition in 2011 {{in comparison to}} earlier studies in 1997 and 1999. The route of the 2011 cruise lead to the Central Arctic Ocean thus samples of Atlantic as well as Pacific influenced water could be taken. In the Atlantic <b>influenced</b> <b>area</b> higher secondary production rates, determined by means of thymidine incorporation, were obtained {{in comparison to the}} Pacific <b>influenced</b> <b>area.</b> Bacterial activities of the sea ice samples in the Atlantic section exceeded in most cases those of melt pools while in the Pacific section melt pools and upper ice samples were more active than the deeper ice layers. However, especially in the Atlantic <b>influenced</b> <b>area,</b> a high percentage of the melt pools were covered by big yellow/orange aggregates. Such amounts of visible organic matter were not observed during the cruises in 1997 and 1999. The differences in bacterial activites were found to be reflected in the phylogenetic bacterial community compositions that were analysed based on 16 S rRNA-gene clone libraries and amplicon sequencing as well as CARD-FISH. In the Atlantic <b>influenced</b> <b>area</b> gammaproteobacteria were found dominating while in the Pacific <b>influenced</b> <b>area</b> betaproteobacteria or alphaproteobacteria were abundant. Further, differences between the bacterial communities in 2011 and 1997 were tried to detect by means of temperature adaptation studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the logistics industry has strongly driven {{the growth of the}} national economy. It is a comprehensive industry which includes service and equipment production. This paper attempts to identify the division of logistics hub and its influence Scope. The paper builds comprehensive evaluation index system of logistics development level, calculates and compares the evaluation scores and the spatial differentiation. Considering geometric particularity of Voronoi diagram, the rationality for dividing up space and the solvability by computer, the paper tries to apply it in the studying of delimitation of <b>influenced</b> <b>area,</b> and gives an analytic demonstration taking the logistics of provinces and cities in China as an example. Some conclusions have been obtained as follows: (1) the <b>influenced</b> <b>area</b> of the logistics is essentially in their administrative region in China. And the <b>influenced</b> <b>area</b> of the provinces and cities which have a higher integrative strength scores, usually covers a wider area than its actual administrative region, on the contrary, the <b>influenced</b> <b>area</b> of the provinces and cities which have a lower integrative strength scores, covers a smaller area than its actual administrative region; (2) The eastern and the central of China with a bigger density have a smaller influence radius, and the absolute <b>influenced</b> <b>area</b> is not so wide. The situation of the western goes to the opposite; (3) the Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing as the core of the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta and the Bohai region, have become logistics industry development hub in China, and radiated the surrounding provinces and cities, showed their respective sphere of influence. © 2009 IEEE.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The predominately manual, {{time-consuming}} and error-prone procedure currently used in engineering offices for {{the calculation of}} preliminary column forces in multi-storey buildings constitutes the motive for the research described in this study. Identifying the current procedure as in need of improvement, techniques and prototype software posing a semi-automated alternative, are developed. <b>Influence</b> <b>areas</b> used for load-assignment are established {{with the use of}} a Voronoi diagram calculated for a specific floor geometry. The forces transferred to the columns are based solely on the size of the <b>influence</b> <b>areas</b> thus calculated. The definition of the floor geometry, as well as the definition of loads and other necessary input parameters, are performed in a CAD-system, into which the Voronoi functionality is integrated. The accuracy of the forces obtained with the implemented procedure and, consequently, the accuracy of the forces as they are calculated in current practice, is determined through comparison with the results of finite element analyses. The comparative analysis of a sample of typical floor geometries allows an evaluation of the results and the identification of tendencies observed regarding the errors obtained. It is concluded that calculating column forces based on <b>influence</b> <b>areas,</b> i. e. solving a geometrical problem without taking any stiffness properties into account, is unsafe. The implication hereof is twofold. Firstly, it serves as a warning concerning the technique currently used in practice and secondly, it steers the investigation in the direction of a finite element analysis: using the <b>influence</b> <b>areas</b> as a basis for automatic meshing, a semi-automated analysis can be performed relatively inexpensively, using plate elements...|$|R

40|$|European anchovy {{recruitment}} to the Guadalquivir estuary mainly {{occurs when}} the environmental conditions show more stability. Unusual changes in the environmental conditions of this estuary negatively impacted on key preys of anchovy and therefore on its nursery function. In this way, nutritional condition should determine strongly the physiological state of this species in estuaries and thus its survival and recruitment. RNA:DNA ratio has been applied with success as indicator of nutritional condition and growth in marine organisms. We study RNA:DNA ratio in anchovies of the coupled system Guadalquivir estuary-coastal <b>influenced</b> <b>area</b> in the Gulf of Cádiz in order to evaluate the condition seasonal variability of this species along this spatial gradient. Spatial differences in the size distribution of anchovy and high values of RNA:DNA in the Guadalquivir estuary compared to its <b>influence</b> coastal <b>area</b> suggest that anchovies migrate to the estuary and they acquire a very good condition. We conclude that RNA:DNA is an useful tool to understand the ecological mechanisms by which the coupled system Guadalquivir estuary-coastal <b>influenced</b> <b>area</b> in the Gulf of Cádiz control {{the success or failure}} of the recruitment of this important fishery resource in the region...|$|R
