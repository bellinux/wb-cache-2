40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Faculty of Education, 1999 The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the provision of schooling in Victoria, for children with problems arising from <b>disturbing</b> <b>behaviour</b> in regular schools. It is these students who have difficulty learning, and cause problems for peers and teachers. This problem has attracted more attention in recent decades than ever before as educators and parents seek solutions for these students. The impact of changes in government policies in Victoria, especially the introduction of the Schools of the Future Program, on students with <b>disturbing</b> <b>behaviour</b> is examined, together with effective means of supporting these students, their teachers and parents. The investigator defines <b>disturbing</b> <b>behaviour</b> and how it has been addressed in schools, particularly in Victoria. She examines the Schools of the Future Program, particularly Global Budgeting and its impact on school policies and programs, focussing on the effect of these provisions in schooling for students with <b>disturbing</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The investigator has conducted a study of school principals in the area centred on Ballarat in order to examine their reactions to recent government education policy changes, and their effects on the schooling for such students. She discusses the implications of these changes for students with <b>disturbing</b> <b>behaviour,</b> including the most recent societal changes involving the youth of today, for example, the State Government initiatives addressing Drugs and Youth Suicide which have impacted on support and resourcing to schools, across the state.

40|$|Background: Acute {{behavioural}} disturbance {{is one of}} the commonest scenarios on acute psychiatric in-patients settings. The management of a <b>disturbed</b> <b>behaviour</b> depends upon the underlying cause. To de-escalate such a behaviour emergency treatment is required to prevent further risk to the person and others by maintaining a safe environment. This paper will guide a simple one page evidence based pharmacological treatment of short term management of acute disturbed or violent behaviour in an emergency setting. Method: The acute <b>disturbed</b> <b>behaviour</b> on in-patients settings could be due to various reasons in context of mental illness or disorder, personality disorder, substance misuse and physical illness. The Rapid Tranquillisation (RT) should only be used if other interventions like appropriate psychological interventions have failed to de-escalate violent behaviour. The aim of treatment should be treating the underlying cause of acute <b>disturbed</b> <b>behaviour</b> rather than over sedating patients, masking their symptoms which may result in delaying appropriate assessment and treatment. The commonest medication use to manage acute <b>disturbed</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{is one of the}} benzodiazines with or without antipsychotic medication and intense monitoring of physical observations after RT. Conclusion: To manage acute <b>disturbed</b> <b>behaviour</b> a comprehensive assessment and treatment by the experienced and trained multi disciplinary team is mandatory. The concise and precise one page guidance will assist the staff to manage patients with acute <b>disturbed</b> <b>behaviour.</b> RT is a treatment of last resort of acute violent behaviour rather than management of underlying condition...|$|E

40|$|Persistent {{disturbing}} behaviour" {{refers to}} a chronic condition in highly unstable, therapy resistant psychiatric patients. Because these patients are difficult to maintain in their natural living environment and even in hospital wards, purposely designed residential psychiatric facilities need to be established. Therefore, {{it is important to}} define and circumscribe the group carefully. Serroyen and co-workers, starting from the longitudinal analysis of a score based on data from the Belgian national psychiatric registry, undertook a discriminant analysis to distinguish persistent <b>disturbing</b> <b>behaviour</b> patients from a control group. They also indicated that there is scope for further subdividing the persistent <b>disturbing</b> <b>behaviour</b> patients into two subgroups, using conventional cluster analysis techniques. We employ a variety of novel longitudinal-data-based cluster analysis techniques. These are based on either conventional growth models, growth-mixture models or latent class growth models. Unlike in earlier analyses, where some evidence for two groups was found, there now is an indication of three groups, which is a finding with high practical and organizational relevance.

40|$|Background. The use of {{seclusion}} is unpalatable to {{nurses and}} frequently unpleasant for patients. Time out is rated by nurses and patients as more acceptable. Several countries have initiated exercises {{to reduce the}} use of seclusion, but England has not. Methods. In this study, data were collected on the sequence of conflict (aggression, rule breaking, absconding etc.) and containment (coerced medication, restraint, special observation etc., including time out and seclusion) for the first 2 weeks of 522 acute admissions on 84 wards in 31 English hospitals between June 2009 and March 2010. Data were analysed to describe what preceded and followed time out and seclusion episodes in a nursing shift. Results. Seclusion was used with 7. 5 % of patients, and time out with 15. 5 %. Both containment methods were used with similar patients in similar circumstances, and both brought <b>disturbed</b> <b>behaviour</b> to a close in half of the cases. Some seclusion appeared to follow less serious <b>disturbed</b> <b>behaviour.</b> There was an important variation in rates of seclusion between hospitals. Seclusion and time out had equally good outcomes {{in the management of}} physical violence to others. Conclusions. There is good evidence that seclusion rates can be reduced safely, and time out can sometimes be used as a substitute. A national registration and reporting system should be introduced in England, and serious efforts made to reduce seclusion use in hospitals where rates are high...|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{describe}} {{the presence and}} type of <b>disturbed</b> eating <b>behaviours</b> and thoughts in a combined male/female Australian sample of adolescents with type 1 diabetes, and examine the association of eating behaviours and thoughts with glycaemic control as evidenced by high glycosylated haemoglobin levels (HbA 1 c). Methods In this cross-sectional descriptive study, 124 adolescents aged 13 - 18 ?years were invited to complete three self-administered questionnaires. The Youth Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (YEDE-Q) and the Eating Disorder Inventory - 3 Risk Composite (EDI- 3 RC) assessed risk for an eating disorder. The third questionnaire, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) assessed emotional and behavioural concerns. Clinical {{data were collected from}} the medical records, routine clinic appointments and the adolescent. Results Any <b>disturbed</b> eating <b>behaviour</b> was reported by approximately one-third of participants (32. 3 %) and was common in females and males (37. 9 % vs. 25. 9 %). Binge eating (17. 7 %), driven exercise (13. 0 %) and dietary restraint (8. 9 %) were the most common <b>disturbed</b> eating <b>behaviours,</b> although restraint was not evident in males. Insulin manipulation/omission (5. 6 %), vomiting (3. 3 %), laxative (0. 8 %) or diuretic use (0. 8 %) were less common. Regression analysis showed a significant association between HbA 1 c and more <b>disturbed</b> eating <b>behaviours</b> and thoughts which remained significant when adjusted for confounders. Conclusions High rates of <b>disturbed</b> eating <b>behaviours</b> and thoughts were seen in this Australian sample of adolescents with type 1 diabetes. High scores on both eating disorder measures were associated with poorer glycaemic control. These results highlight the need to screen for disordered eating in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
