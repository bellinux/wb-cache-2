40|$|BACKGROUND: Poor {{quality of}} care and access to {{effective}} and affordable interventions {{have been attributed to}} constraints and bottlenecks within and outside the health system. However, there is limited understanding of health system barriers to utilization and delivery of appropriate, high-impact, and cost-effective interventions at the point of service delivery in districts and sub-districts in low-income countries. In this study we illustrate the use of the bottleneck analysis approach, which could be used to identify bottlenecks in service delivery within the district health system. METHODS: A modified Tanahashi model with six determinants for <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> was used to determine bottlenecks in service provision for maternal and newborn care. The following interventions provided during antenatal care were used as tracer interventions: use of iron and folic acid, intermittent presumptive treatment for malaria, HIV counseling and testing, and syphilis testing. Data from cross-sectional household and health facility surveys in Mayuge and Namayingo districts in Uganda were used in this study. RESULTS: <b>Effective</b> <b>coverage</b> and human resource gaps were identified as the biggest bottlenecks in both districts, with <b>coverage</b> <b>ranging</b> from 0 % to 66 % for <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> and from 46 % to 58 % for availability of health facility staff. Our findings revealed a similar pattern in bottlenecks in both districts for particular interventions although the districts are functionally independent. CONCLUSION: The modified Tanahashi model is an analysis tool {{that can be used to}} identify bottlenecks to <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> within the district health system, for instance, the <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> for maternal and newborn care interventions. However, the analysis is highly dependent on the availability of data to populate all six determinants and could benefit from further validation analysis for the causes of bottlenecks identified...|$|R
40|$|GNSS’s orbit {{determinations}} always rely {{on ground}} station or intersatellite links (ISL). In the emergency of satellite-to-ground links and ISL break-off, BeiDou navigation satellite system (BDS) satellites cannot determine their orbits. In this paper, we propose {{to add a}} spaceborne annular beam antenna for receiving the global positioning system (GPS) and global navigation satellite system (GLONASS) signals; therefore, the BDS satellites may be capable of determining their orbits by GPS/GLONASS signals. Firstly, the spectrum selection, the power isolation, the range of Doppler frequency shift, and changing rate {{are taken into account}} for the feasibility. Specifically, the L 2 band signals are chosen for receiving and processing in order to prevent the overlapping of the receiving and transmitting signals. Secondly, the minimum number of visible satellites (MNVS), carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N 0), dilution of precision (GDOP), and geometric distance root-mean-square (gdrms) are evaluated for acquiring the <b>effective</b> receiving antennas’ <b>coverage</b> <b>ranges.</b> Finally, the scheme of deploying 3 receiving antennas is proved to be optimal by analysis and simulations over the middle earth orbit (MEO), geostationary earth orbit (GEO), and the inclined geosynchronous satellite orbit (IGSO).

According to land observation requirements of remote sensing, an index evaluation system of <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> ability for remote sensing on land observation is build up. According to data storage capacity, data transmission capacity between satellite and ground, longest observation time in one loop, solar elevation angle of satellite observation and so on, an <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> calculation method is proposed based on physical capacity constraint for optical remote sensing satellite.

40|$|Background: After {{decades of}} neglect, a renewed global focus on malaria was {{initiated}} in the 90 s, followed by global financial {{support in the}} early 2000 s. Zanzibar {{has been in the}} forefront of these renewed efforts: Case management and vector-control interventions have been implemented and scaled-up rapidly, resulting in markedly reduced malaria transmission and the targeting of malaria elimination. Aim: The overall aim of this thesis was to assess caretakers' uptake of malaria control interventions for under-five children in Zanzibar, an area where malaria transmission has rapidly decreased. Methods: In Study I, a follow-up survey of 210 caretakers was performed to assess caretaker adherence to Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs), where caretakers were interviewed in their homes four days after receiving the three-day treatment for their children. In Studies II & III, an assessment of the <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> of vector control interventions was carried out in two community-based surveys in 2006 and 2009, with 509 and 560 caretakers, respectively. Both surveys were done in North A and Micheweni districts. In the 2006 survey, the system effectiveness of a targeted free mass distribution of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) was also assessed, and in the 2009 survey, caretaker perceptions of the malaria situation in Zanzibar and of vector control interventions, were evaluated. Perceptions of malaria and vector control interventions were further explored by conducting in-depth interviews with 19 caretakers (Study IV). Results: Moderate adherence of 77 % to Artesunate-Amodiaquine (AsAq) was documented, and was mostly due to misunderstanding or forgetting the correct dose regimen. Factors associated with adherence were caretaker's education exceeding 7 years and receiving the exact number of pills to complete the treatment regimen, while administering the first dose at the health facility resulted in complete adherence (I). System effectiveness of the targeted mass distribution had increased in the distribution scale-up in North A district as compared to the pilot distribution in Micheweni. This resulted in high (87 %) and equitable <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> of LLINs in under-five children in the North A district. <b>Effective</b> <b>coverage</b> was associated with receiving an LLIN and thinking that LLINs were better than conventional nets (II). <b>Effective</b> <b>coverage</b> of LLINs in under-fives in the 2009 survey was also equitable and relatively high (70 %) following an un-targeted mass distribution, while <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> of IRS was as high as 95 %, resulting in almost perfect <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> (98 %) of at least one vector control intervention (III). Seasonality was found to interrupt continuous adherence to bed-nets (III & IV). Low risk perceptions of malaria (III & IV) were not significantly associated with <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> (III), although the higher perceived risk for children is in line with the finding that children were prioritized for use of bed-nets (III & IV). Vector control interventions were generally well accepted (II-IV), and caretakers appreciated the importance of their continued use as malaria further declines (III). Conclusions: Findings of this thesis indicate that caretaker uptake of malaria control interventions for children remains high in Zanzibar in the face of declining malaria burden. ACTs, freely provided at public health facilities, were relatively well adhered to, and the high <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> of IRS, together with satisfactory <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> of LLINs, provided an almost perfect <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> of vector control interventions.

Cross-sectional data from households and health facilities in Tandahimba and Newala districts {{were used in the}} analysis. We adapted Tanahashi’s model to estimate intervention coverage in conditional stages and to identify implementation bottlenecks in access, health facility readiness and clinical practice. The interventions studied were syphilis and pre-eclampsia screening, partograph use, active management of the third stage of labour and postpartum care. <b>Effective</b> <b>coverage</b> was low in both districts, ranging from only 3 % for postpartum care in Tandahimba to 49 % for active management of the third stage of labour in Newala. In Tandahimba, health facility readiness was the largest bottleneck for most interventions, whereas in Newala, it was access. Clinical practice was another large bottleneck for syphilis screening in both districts. The poor <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> of maternal and newborn health interventions in rural districts of the United Republic of Tanzania reinforces the need to prioritize health service quality.

40|$|Thin film planar {{models of}} {{core-shell}} catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in PEM fuel cells, have been synthesised with tin doped titania as {{the support for}} platinum. High-throughput methods {{have been used to}} investigate the effect that the level of tin doping in the titania core supporting material and the degree of crystallisation have on the loading of platinum at which bulk platinum like oxygen reduction behaviour is achieved. At high <b>effective</b> <b>coverages</b> of platinum, the oxygen reduction activity is always similar to that of a polycrystalline platinum electrode. This suggests that a continuous platinum thin film can always be formed at higher loadings.

The <b>effective</b> platinum <b>coverage</b> at which a continuous layer of platinum is formed, and exhibits the high activity, depends strongly on the support.

However, {{little is known about}} how survey-based estimates of immunization (crude coverage) compare to the seroprevalence of antibodies (<b>effective</b> <b>coverage),</b> particularly in low-resource settings. In poor areas of Mexico and Nicaragua, we used household surveys to gather information on measles immunization from child health cards and caregiver recall. We also collected dried blood spots (DBS) from children aged 12 to 23 months to compare crude and <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> of measles immunization. We used survey-weighted logistic regression to identify individual, maternal, household, community, and health facility characteristics that predict gaps between crude <b>coverage</b> and <b>effective</b> <b>coverage.</b> We found that crude coverage was significantly higher than <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> (83 % versus 68 % in Mexico; 85 % versus 50 % in Nicaragua). A large proportion of children (19 % in Mexico; 43 % in Nicaragua) had health card documentation of measles immunization but lacked antibodies. These discrepancies varied from 0 % to 100 % across municipalities in each country. In multivariate analyses, card-positive children in Mexico were more likely to lack antibodies if they resided in urban areas or the jurisdiction of De Los Llanos. In contrast, card-positive children in Nicaragua were more likely to lack antibodies if they resided in rural areas or the North Atlantic region, had low weight-for-age, or attended health facilities with a greater number of refrigerators. Findings highlight that reliance on child health cards to measure population protection against measles is unwise. We call for the evaluation of immunization programs using serological methods, especially in poor areas where the cold chain is likely to be compromised.

40|$|Abstract Background Formerly a high malaria {{transmission}} area, Zanzibar is now targeting malaria elimination. A {{major challenge}} is to avoid resurgence of malaria, the success of which includes maintaining high <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> of vector control interventions such as bed nets and indoor residual spraying (IRS). In this study, caretakers' continued use of preventive measures for their children is evaluated, following a sharp reduction in malaria transmission. Methods A cross-sectional community-based survey was conducted in June 2009 in North A and Micheweni districts in Zanzibar. Households were randomly selected using two-stage cluster sampling. Interviews were conducted with 560 caretakers of under-five-year old children, who were asked about perceptions on the malaria situation, vector control, household assets, and intention for continued use of vector control as malaria burden further decreases. Results <b>Effective</b> <b>coverage</b> of vector control interventions for under-five children remains high, although most caretakers (65 %; 363 / 560) did not perceive malaria as presently being a major health issue. Seventy percent (447 / 643) of the under-five children slept under a long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) and 94 % (607 / 643) were living in houses targeted with IRS. In total, 98 % (628 / 643) {{of the children were}} covered by {{at least one of the}} vector control interventions. Seasonal bed-net use for children was reported by 25 % (125 / 508) of caretakers of children who used bed nets. A high proportion of caretakers (95 %; 500 / 524) stated that they intended to continue using preventive measures for their under-five children as malaria burden further reduces. Malaria risk perceptions and different perceptions of vector control were not found to be significantly associated with LLIN <b>effective</b> <b>coverage.</b> Conclusions While the majority of caretakers felt that malaria had been reduced in Zanzibar, <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> of vector control interventions remained high. Caretakers appreciated the interventions and recognized the value of sustaining their use. Thus, sustaining high <b>effective</b> <b>coverage</b> of vector control interventions, which is crucial for reaching malaria elimination in Zanzibar, can be achieved by maintaining effective delivery of these interventions. </p...|$|R
