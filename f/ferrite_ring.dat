50|$|Core {{memory was}} {{a matrix of}} laced ferrite cores. Because {{transistors}} were relatively slow at that time, Hounsfield also used magnetic logic units {{to speed up the}} operation of the machine to achieve a processing power comparable with a valve/tube computer. These logic units consisted of a single <b>ferrite</b> <b>ring</b> (toroid), with up to fifteen connections to it.|$|E
50|$|Between each {{copper coil}} leg are placed {{the pieces of}} the sub-divided and {{insulated}} iron ferrite cores making up the <b>ferrite</b> <b>ring.</b> The <b>ferrite</b> <b>ring</b> carries the magnetic flux between the fixed permanent magnets, without needing to use the copper strips (which carry electric current). As the armature spins, current flows from the one brush, into the commutator, outwards along one copper coil leg, which is sandwiched between the iron ferrite core pieces. When the current reaches the connecting crimp positioned on the outer edge, it transfers to a new leg on rear side of the armature and runs back to the centre, again sandwiched between ferrites 45-degrees out of phase from the previous ferrites. The electric current then arrives back at the centre, 90-degrees later and swaps sides back to the front face before reaching the corresponding brush (of the opposite electrical polarity) 135-degrees from the initial brush.|$|E

The short duration voltage collapse, traveling surges in busbar causes Very Fast Transient Over voltages (VFTO) and Very fast Transient Currents (VFTC) in the GIS substation. The main {{challenge is to}} reduce VFTO and VFTC amplitudes. Several methods have been proposed and examined in the past, such as damping Resistor and <b>Ferrite</b> <b>rings.</b> The VFTO and VFTC damping solutions utilizing damping Resistor, <b>ferrite</b> <b>rings</b> has been analyzed using most popular and widely used software package Electro Magnetic Transient Programming (EMTP). The simulation of mitigation methods like damping resistor and <b>Ferrite</b> <b>rings</b> shows that a damping effect can be achieved. The damping resistor suffers with the difficulty of inserting inside the busduct {{and the other one}} is <b>Ferrite</b> magnetic material <b>rings</b> goes easily into saturation, which complicates the design and reduces its general applicability and robustness. This paper investigates the new techniques to suppress the VFTO and VFTC in a 245 kV GIS substation by considering the complete substation model for simulation using EMTP. Rings of a Nanocrystalline alloy placed around the GIS conductor were investigated, developed the equivalent model and simulated using EMTP. Prominent results have been achieved with the Nanocrystalline models...|$|R

50|$|Ferrite beads {{are one of}} the {{simplest}} and least expensive types of interference filters to install on preexisting electronic cabling. For a simple <b>ferrite</b> <b>ring,</b> the wire is simply wrapped around the core through the center, typically five or seven times. Clamp-on cores are also available, which attach without wrapping the wire: this type of ferrite core is usually designed so that the wire passes only once through it. If the fit is not snug enough, the core can be secured with cable ties or, if the center is large enough, the cabling can loop through one or more times. Small ferrite beads can be slipped over component leads to suppress parasitic oscillation.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} the Lynch motor {{armature}} is significantly different compared to other types of motor. The armature coils are formed from insulated copper strips each in a 'U' shape (like a tuning fork). One leg is then bent 45 degrees clockwise, while the other leg is bent 45 degrees anticlockwise. Each coil leg contains several bends before reaching {{the outside of the}} armature to be able to pass radially through the <b>ferrite</b> <b>ring</b> before the ends finish 90 degree apart. At the outer edge each copper strip has a crimp forming an electrical connection to its companion 90 degrees rotated. The inner edge of the copper strips have the insulation removed on the front face only, to form the commutator surface where the brushes make contact.|$|E
50|$|In Bell System {{telephone}} exchanges, {{particularly the}} 5XB switches, {{information from the}} marker told the sender that the call required ANI, and stored the calling equipment number in reed relay packs in the sender. The sender used the transverter connector (TVC) to seize a transverter (TV), which was a bay {{of a few hundred}} flat spring relays that controlled all AMA functions. The TV looked in the AMA translator (AMAT) that took care of these particular few thousand lines. AMAT was a rack of <b>ferrite</b> <b>ring</b> cores with cross-connect wires passing through holes of 3 × 4 inches or about a decimeter square, one wire per line. The wire was terminated on a wire wrap peg representing that particular line, and passed through a ring that represented the NNX digits of the billing number, then the M, C, D and finally Units of that number. When queried, AMAT sent a high-current pulse through the wire for that particular line, inducing pulses in the appropriate rings which were amplified by a cold cathode tube amplifier and then by a relay, and sent back to the transverter which supplied it to the sender for transmission by ANI to the tandem office.|$|E

50|$|Hall sensors {{can detect}} stray {{magnetic}} fields easily, {{including that of}} Earth, so they work well as electronic compasses: but this also means that such stray fields can hinder accurate measurements of small magnetic fields. To solve this problem, Hall sensors are often integrated with magnetic shielding of some kind. For example, a Hall sensor integrated into a <b>ferrite</b> <b>ring</b> (as shown) can reduce the detection of stray fields {{by a factor of}} 100 or better (as the external magnetic fields cancel across the ring, giving no residual magnetic flux). This configuration also provides an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio and drift effects of over 20 times that of a bare Hall device.The range of a given feedthrough sensor may be extended upward and downward by appropriate wiring. To extend the range to lower currents, multiple turns of the current-carrying wire may be made through the opening, each turn adding to the sensor output the same quantity; when the sensor is installed onto a printed circuit board, the turns can be carried out by a staple on the board. To extend the range to higher currents, a current divider may be used. The divider splits the current across two wires of differing widths and the thinner wire, carrying a smaller proportion of the total current, passes through the sensor.|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{in the design of}} rf cavities for the acceleration of medium-energy charged ions is the need to rapidly sweep the radio frequency over a large range. From low-power medical synchrotrons to high-power accelerator driven subcritical reactor systems, and from fixed focus alternating gradient accelerators to rapid cycling synchrotrons, there is a strong need for more efficient, and faster, acceleration of protons and light ions in the semirelativistic range of hundreds of MeV/u. A conventional way to achieve a large, rapid frequency sweep (perhaps over a range of a factor of 6) is to use custom-designed ferrite-loaded cavities. <b>Ferrite</b> <b>rings</b> enable the precise tuning of the resonant frequency of a cavity, through the control of the incremental permeability that is possible by introducing a pseudoconstant azimuthal magnetic field. However, rapid changes over large permeability ranges incur anomalous behavior such as the “Q-loss” and “f-dot” loss phenomena that limit performance while requiring high bias currents. Notwithstanding the incomplete understanding of these phenomena, they can be ameliorated by introducing a “harmonic ratcheting” acceleration scheme in which two or more rf cavities take turns accelerating the beam—one turns on when the other turns off, at different harmonics—so that the radio frequency can be constrained to remain in a smaller range. Harmonic ratcheting also has straightforward performance advantages, depending on the particular parameter set at hand. In some typical cases it is possible to halve the length of the cavities, or to double the effective gap voltage, or to double the repetition rate. This paper discusses and quantifies the advantages of harmonic ratcheting in general. Simulation results for the particular case of a rapid cycling medical synchrotron ratcheting from harmonic number 9 to 2 show that stability and performance criteria are met even when realistic engineering details are taken into consideration...|$|R
