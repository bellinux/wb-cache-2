5000|$|A CRT {{projector}} is a {{video projector}} {{that uses a}} small, high-brightness cathode ray tube as the image <b>generating</b> <b>element.</b> The image is then focused and enlarged onto a screen using a lens kept {{in front of the}} CRT face. The first color CRT projectors came out in the early 1950s. Most modern CRT projectors are color and have three separate CRTs (instead of a single, color CRT), and their own lenses to achieve color images. The red, green and blue portions of the incoming video signal are processed and sent to the respective CRTs whose images are focused by their lenses to achieve the overall picture on the screen. Various designs have made it to production, including the [...] "direct" [...] CRT-lens design, and the Schmidt-CRT, which employed a phosphor screen that illuminates a perforated spherical mirror, all within an evacuated [...] "tube." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{links between}} computational intelligence (CI), data mining and knowledge discovery. The <b>generating</b> <b>elements</b> of soft computing based data mining algorithms are defined where the extracted knowledge {{is represented by}} fuzzy rule-based expert systems. It is recognized that both model performance and interpretability are of major importance, and effort has to make to keep the resulting rule bases small and comprehensible. Therefore, the model is derived from data by CI techniques developed for feature selection, feature extraction, model optimization and model reduction (rule base simplification). Applications of these <b>generating</b> <b>elements</b> to the Wine data classification problem are also shown. ...|$|R

Procedurally <b>generated</b> <b>elements</b> {{have appeared in}} earlier video games: The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall {{takes place in a}} mostly procedurally generated world, giving a world roughly twice the actual size of the British Isles. Soldier of Fortune from Raven Software uses simple routines to detail enemy models, while its sequel featured a randomly-generated level mode. Avalanche Studios employed procedural generation to create a large and varied group of detailed tropical islands for Just Cause. No Man's Sky, a game developed by games studio Hello Games, is all based upon procedurally <b>generated</b> <b>elements.</b>|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to define a {{generating}} function for q-Eulerian polynomials and numbers attached to any character χ of the finite cyclic group G. We derive many functional equations, q-difference equations and partial deferential equations related to these generating functions. By using these equations, we find many properties of q-Eulerian polynomials and numbers. Using the <b>generating</b> <b>element</b> of the finite cyclic group G and the <b>generating</b> <b>element</b> of the subgroups of G, we show that the generating function with a conductor f can be written as a sum of the generating function with conductors which are less than f.|$|E
