5|$|Gingrich and the {{incoming}} Republican majority's promise {{to slow the}} rate of government spending conflicted with the president's agenda <b>for</b> <b>Medicare,</b> education, the environment and public health, leading to two temporary shutdowns {{of the federal government}} totaling 28 days.|$|E
5|$|The act {{includes}} {{a host of}} delivery system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality. These include Medicare payment changes to discourage hospital-acquired conditions and readmissions, bundled payment initiatives, the Center <b>for</b> <b>Medicare</b> and Medicaid Innovation, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, {{and the creation of}} Accountable care organizations.|$|E
5|$|The {{other related}} issue {{concerned}} advance-care planning consultation: {{a section of}} the House reform proposal would have reimbursed physicians for providing patient-requested consultations <b>for</b> <b>Medicare</b> recipients on end-of-life health planning (which is covered by many private plans), enabling patients to specify, on request, the kind of care they wished to receive. The provision was not included in ACA.|$|E

5|$|One {{was that}} under the law, seniors could be denied care due to their age and the other that the {{government}} would advise seniors to end their lives instead of receiving care. The ostensible basis of these claims was the provision for an Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). IPAB was given the authority to recommend cost-saving changes to Medicare by facilitating the adoption of cost-effective treatments and cost-recovering measures when the statutory levels set <b>for</b> <b>Medicare</b> were exceeded within any given 3-year period. In fact, the Board was prohibited from recommending changes that would reduce payments to certain providers before 2020, and was prohibited from recommending changes in premiums, benefits, eligibility and taxes, or other changes that would result in rationing.|$|E
5|$|As of December 2016 {{there were}} 32 states (including Washington DC) that had adopted the Medicaid extension, while 19 states had not. Those states that {{expanded}} Medicaid had a 7.3% uninsured rate on {{average in the}} first quarter of 2016, while those that did not expand Medicaid had a 14.1% uninsured rate, among adults aged 18 to 64. Following the Supreme Court ruling in 2012, which held that states would not lose Medicaid funding if they didn't expand Medicaid under the ACA, several states rejected expanded Medicaid coverage. Over half of the national uninsured population lived in those states. In a report to Congress, the Centers <b>for</b> <b>Medicare</b> and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated that the cost of expansion was $6,366 per person for 2015, about 49 percent above previous estimates. An estimated 9 million to 10 million people had gained Medicaid coverage, mostly low-income adults. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated in October 2015 that 3.1 million additional people were not covered because of states that rejected the Medicaid expansion.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) was {{established}} as a federal agency responsible for the administration of Medicare and Medicaid. This would be renamed to Centers <b>for</b> <b>Medicare</b> and Medicaid Services (CMS) in 2001. By 1983, the diagnosis-related group (DRG) replaced pay for service reimbursements to hospitals <b>for</b> <b>Medicare</b> patients.|$|E

These men and women tend to have particularly poor health – more than half are being treated for five or more chronic conditions—and high costs.

The assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963 proved fortuitous <b>for</b> <b>Medicare's</b> legislative chances. President Lyndon B.
