5|$|In March 2011, {{one of the}} sub {{contractors}} of Bouygues fell under criticism for the dumping of tunnel fill on sensitive wetlands on Virginia Key. They {{were supposed to be}} dumping the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found dumping it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees with a piece of equipment that got stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 cubic yards (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean. The north point of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a <b>dumping</b> <b>site</b> for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E

In 1997, the city connected with the Tubas Area Electricity Network which is provided by the Israeli Electric Cooperation.

It is collected 3-4 times daily from the residential area, which is sent to a shared <b>dumping</b> <b>site</b> [...] from the city. The main disposal method used is burning. Tubas is not connected to the sewage network, therefore all households dispose of their waste water in cesspits, a major source of pollution in groundwater.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1952, when {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the site would likely be developed for construction, Hooker ceased use of Love Canal as a dumpsite. During its 10-year lifespan, the 16-acre landfill served as the <b>dumping</b> <b>site</b> of 21,800 tons of chemicals, mostly composed of products such as [...] "caustics, alkalines, fatty acid and chlorinated hydrocarbons resulting from the manufacturing of dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins". These chemicals were buried at a depth of twenty to twenty-five feet (6 to 6.5 m). Upon its closure, the canal was covered with a clay seal to prevent leakage. Over time, vegetation settled and began to grow atop the dump site.|$|E
2500|$|Senator Frank E. Moss of Utah {{asked the}} National Park Service {{consider}} the Great Salt Lake {{for inclusion in}} the National Park System in 1959. The study had high praise for Antelope Island as a potential national park, but found [...] "little else worthwhile about the Great Salt Lake". The National Park service was concerned with a lack of planning by the State of Utah {{and the fact that the}} lake was used as a <b>dumping</b> <b>site</b> for municipal and industrial waste. The park service was impressed by the scenic and recreational possibilities of the northern end of Antelope Island, describing it as the [...] "most impressive site of the lake." [...] The qualities of the island were not enough to persuade the park service to seek the creation of a national park encompassing the Great Salt Lake. The park service cited years of [...] "mismanagement, apathy, and lack of any coordinated plan for its proper development." [...] Sewage from Salt Lake City that was being dumped untreated into the lake at the time and waste from a smelting facility on the southern end of the lake were two of the greatest sources of pollution. The park service did express interest in safeguarding the lake since it is a remnant of the Pleistocene. The park service also noted a lack of recreation on the lake and an inaction by the state to positively respond to an earlier request for the formation of a state park.|$|E

2500|$|As of 2015, the {{department}} uses {{a large number}} of Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors as their main fleet of patrol vehicles which was first ordered in 1996 replacing the Chevrolet Caprice 9C1 (used between 1988 and in patrol service until 2004 (replacing the Ford LTD Crown Victoria squads to 1987 along with M-bodied Mopars (primarily the Plymouth Gran Fury (both R and M platform) last used in 1989)). They have Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor models from dating from 1999 to 2011. Since Ford no longer produces the [...] "crown Vic" [...] (procurement of the Crown Vic ended in April 2011 when the orders were filled), The department has chosen to phase in the Chevy Tahoe PPV and Ford Police Interceptor Utility(Explorer) as the successor to the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor. The department is continuing to test new Chevy Caprice PPV models and Ford Taurus Interceptors (including the fifth-generation Explorer) as well - the test mules as of 2015 have been integrated into the mainstream vehicle fleet. [...] It also uses pickup trucks from the Big Three, such as the Chevrolet Colorado, Ford F150, and Dodge Ram for their Truck Enforcement Unit. There is also a small fleet of Dodge Chargers and Chevrolet Camaro s, which are mainly used as [...] "stealth traffic patrol vehicles" [...] (which is part of the Traffic Enforcement division). The stealth vehicles are plain white police cars with a slicktop roof and gray, reflective [...] "HOUSTON POLICE" [...] graphics on the side {{as well as on the}} front bumper, and hidden emergency lights that are driven by uniformed officers. The Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor is also used in this manner - as of late 2011 the stealth patrol vehicles are now painted black. The stealth squads have been supplemented with 14 Ford Taurus Police Interceptors in early 2014 (painted black). Solo (motorcycle) officers use Harley-Davidson motorcycles. [...] The patrol vehicle livery, painted white with blue lettered graphics dating back to 1999 (which replaced the Columbia Blue livery last used in 1998 and retired a decade later), is being phased out for a black and white color scheme where 100 vehicles are painted from $60,000 earmarked from asset forfeiture funds (under HPD policy the previous livery is still used in service until official retirement). HPD squads are usually retired when the vehicle reaches 100,000 miles (they are not reassigned to reserve or secondary duty as with the Austin or San Antonio PD after 80,000 miles) - some squads dating over 10 model years old which are no longer used for patrol duty are usually reassigned either as bait squads (HPD will park an unmanned squad in a high crime area or illegal <b>dumping</b> <b>site)</b> or the Mobility Response Division - the older HPD fleet used by Mobility Response have been retired and replaced with Ford F150 extended cab pickup trucks from the Truck Enforcement Unit. Around 2016 the Houston Chronicle revealed that some of the older squads are still in service but the breakdown rate has increased - a 100,000 mile marked squad (or 120,000 mile unmarked vehicle) has the life expectancy of an automobile with 300,000 miles with regular maintenance. At the time HPD ordered 50 new Ford Police Interceptor Utilities for the command staff but not the mainstream vehicle fleet ({{the department}} has procured newer vehicles but the budget crunch has taken in a few new orders whilst the older squads are still operational. A budget crunch in major Texas cities is partly to blame where municipal budgets are usually slashed including priority spending for first responders. Most modern HPD Patrol cars today are Blue and white saying [...] " [...] HOUSTON POLICE" [...] on the side.Newer models use a mixture of black and white paint now with 911 EMERGENCY listed on the rear side of the car or truck.|$|E

The upland location of these refuse <b>dump</b> <b>sites</b> to the adjoining wells and the potential use of the dump soil for compost could cause environmental hazard.
