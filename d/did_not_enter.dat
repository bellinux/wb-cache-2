50|$|If the entrant enters, {{the best}} {{response}} of the incumbent is to accommodate. If the incumbent accommodates, the best {{response of the}} entrant is to enter (and gain profit). Hence the strategy profile in which the incumbent accommodates if the entrant enters and the entrant enters if the incumbent accommodates is a Nash equilibrium. However, if the incumbent {{is going to play}} fight, the best response of the entrant is to <b>not</b> <b>enter.</b> If the entrant <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>enter,</b> it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> matter what the incumbent chooses to do (since there is no other firm to do it to - note that if the entrant <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>enter,</b> fight and accommodate yield the same payoffs to both players; the incumbent will not lower its prices if the entrant <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>enter).</b> Hence fight can be considered as a best response of the incumbent if the entrant <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>enter.</b> Hence the strategy profile in which the incumbent fights if the entrant <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>enter</b> and the entrant <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>enter</b> if the incumbent fights is a Nash equilibrium. Since the game is dynamic, any claim by the incumbent that it will fight is an incredible threat because by the time the decision node is reached where it can decide to fight (i.e. the entrant has entered), it would be irrational to do so. Therefore this Nash equilibrium can be eliminated by backward induction.|$|R

Another unusual vehicle in the Kelvin fleet was the only Leyland Lynx bought by Scottish Bus Group, which was delivered new in 1989.
