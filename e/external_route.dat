40|$|In {{the real}} world, the route/path with the {{shortest}} travel {{time in a}} road network is more meaningful than that with the shortest network distance for location-based services (LBS). However, not every LBS provider has adequate resources to compute/estimate travel time for routes by themselves. A cost-effective way for LBS providers to estimate travel time for routes is to issue <b>external</b> <b>route</b> requests to Web mapping services (e. g., Google Maps, Bing Maps, and MapQuest Maps). Due to {{the high cost of}} processing such <b>external</b> <b>route</b> requests and the usage limits of Web mapping services, we take the advantage of direction sharing, parallel requesting and waypoints supported by Web mapping services {{to reduce the number of}} <b>external</b> <b>route</b> requests and the query response time for shortest travel-time route queries in this paper.

Then, we model the problem of selecting the optimal waypoints for an <b>external</b> <b>route</b> request as finding the longest simple path in a weighted complete digraph. As it is a MAX SNP-hard problem, we propose a greedy algorithm with performance guarantee to find the best set of waypoints in an <b>external</b> <b>route</b> request.

40|$|Abstract — In {{spite of}} {{inability}} to dynamically adapt to network topology failures and high management overhead, Static Routing still offers robustness to routing convergence failure, <b>external</b> <b>route</b> spoofing and easy prediction. This paper proposes a Static Routing strategy with an objective of extending {{its ability to}} adapt to logical network topology changes, equipment failures or network outages 'on the fly'. This strategy will involve discovery of all possible Static Routes from a specific source router to destination router, analyzing and ordering their applicability using optimality principle based Sink Tree approach. A random subnet composed of fifteen routers is simulated and mapped to Sink Tree and most obvious paths between random source and destination are analyzed. Static Routes are traced to extract information about hop count from source to destination. The hop count information is recorded for each Static Route trace and comparative analysis is performed. Based on this comparison the Static Route are sorted in order of preference as per optimality principle and are offered to router as secondary routes in event of failure of primary preferred Static Route, thereby retaining the benefits of Static Routing while still availing the flexibility of Dynamic Routing to some extent...|$|E

40|$|Many large ISP {{networks}} today rely on route-reflection [1] {{to allow}} their iBGP to scale. Route-reflection was officially introduced {{to limit the number}} of iBGP sessions, compared to the nx(n- 1) / 2 sessions required by an iBGP full- 2 mesh. Besides its impact on the number of iBGP sessions, route-reflection has consequences on the diversity of the routes known to the routers inside an AS. In this paper, we quantify the diversity of the BGP routes inside a tier- 1 network. Our analysis shows that the use of route-reflection leads to a very poor route diversity compared to an iBGP full-mesh. Most routers inside a tier- 1 network know only a single <b>external</b> <b>route</b> in eBGP origin. We identify two causes for this lack of diversity. First, some routes are never selected as best by any router inside the network, but are known only to some border routers. Second, among the routes that are selected as best by at least one other router, a few are selected as best by a majority of the routers, preventing the propagation of many routes inside the AS. We show that the main reason for this diversity loss is how BGP chooses the best routes among those available inside the AS...|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} of today, {{with the use}} of computers and the Internet, has enabled new types of map usage. Screen maps provide possibilities that could never be offered by standard paper maps, and allow maps to be integrated into information services. Mobile map services are information services adapted to mobility; using small screen presentation devices and communication networks to access various information databases on the fly. The research presented in this licentiate dissertation focuses on two aspects of mobile map services. The first papers are concerned with a more technical matter: the creation of methods to import and integrate <b>external</b> <b>route</b> data into a mobile map service. The developed methods were to be based on standards, and also consider user aspects to some degree. The last paper is concerned with user aspects, more specifically amount of information, for small screen maps. It presents an investigation that was performed with the aim to find if a method for presenting a suitable amount of information could be created. The import and integration of <b>external</b> <b>route</b> data into a mobile map service was part of the EU project GiMoDig. The GiMoDig project aimed at establishing methods for distributing cartographic data from core databases at NMAs to mobile devices. As one of the main uses of maps is navigation, it was desirable to integrate a routing service in the GiMoDig prototype. The integration of the route data was performed with a matching approach. The road network was searched in order to find corresponding road segments to the imported route segments. Like in other studies, the matching procedure was adapted to the used datasets. The characteristics of the datasets, and their similarities were taken advantage of, in order to find a satisfactory matching approach. The study of amount of information for small screen maps refers to the matter of usability, and the need to create products (and maps) as useful and user friendly as possible. Bearing in mind human perceptive and cognitive capacities, it would be of importance to find an optimal amount of information that would enable the user to gain as much knowledge from the map as possible. Information can be somewhat difficult to define as it is imposed with meaning. Therefore, {{in order to be able}} to measure information quantitatively, a syntactic approach was adopted. A hypothesis is that we always want the same amount of map information, for a specific scale, on the screen of a mobile device. To test this hypothesis a user study was performed. The study showed that there may be a relationship between amount of information and preferred generalization level. It also showed that the test persons preferred rather detailed maps over more simplified ones...|$|E
