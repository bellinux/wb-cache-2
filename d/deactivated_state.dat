Thus, a high degree of complementarity between these S 3 b and NTS 4 regions is not required for basic voltage gating per se. Remarkably, the voltage-gated Shaker K+ channel remains voltage gated after a 43 residue paddle sequence {{is replaced by a}} glycine triplet. Therefore, the paddle motif comprises a minimal core that suffices to confer voltage gating in the physiological voltage range, and a larger, modulatory part.

40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} aimed to {{introduce}} the distinction between goal-directed and undirected thoughts used in general psychology into the automatic self-talk paradigm used in sport psychology. In particular, {{the purpose of this}} investigation was to explore the structure and the content of athletes' goal-directed and undirected self-talk. Methods: Overall, 87 athletes participated in two studies (n = 32 and n = 55, respectively). Qualitative methods were used to analyze data, in the form of text units that were collected retrospectively through thought sampling regarding participants' self-talk. Results: The analysis revealed differences in the structure of goal-directed and un-directed self-talk. Spontaneous, undirected, self-talk involved mostly explaining past outcomes and foreseeing upcoming events, whereas goal-directed self-talk aimed at attaining control over cognitions and activation for action. Spontaneous self-talk could be classified based on two dimensions: valence (positive negative) and time-perspective (retrospective, present-related, and anticipatory), whereas goal-directed self-talk could be classified into two different dimensions: activation (activated <b>states,</b> neutral, <b>deactivated</b> <b>states)</b> and time-orientation (past, past present, present future, and future oriented). Furthermore, differences were also observed with regard to the person at which statements were addressed. Conclusions: Overall, the findings attempt to explore a new perspective into the study of self-talk, which can help improving the conceptualization, creating new research directions, and enhancing the understanding of self-talk for developing effective interventions.

To better understand the mechanisms of regulation of SR Ca 2 + release by Ca 2 + {{on both sides of the}} SR membrane, we investigated SR Ca 2 + release in a wide range of cytosolic Ca 2 + concentrations ([Ca 2 +]cyt; 1 – 100 μm) in permeabilized canine ventricular myocytes by monitoring [Ca 2 +] inside the SR ([Ca 2 +]SR). Exposing myocytes to activating [Ca 2 +]cyt resulted in spontaneous oscillations of [Ca 2 +]SR due to periodic opening and closing of the RyR 2 s. Elevating [Ca 2 +]cyt (up to 10 μm) increased the frequency of [Ca 2 +]SR oscillations; however at higher [Ca 2 +]cyt (> 50 μm) the oscillations diminished due to RyR 2 s staying perpetually open, resulting in depleted SR. Ablation of cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ 2) altered the [Ca 2 +]cyt dependence of Ca 2 + release oscillations such that oscillations were highly frequent at low [Ca 2 +]cyt (100 nm) but became diminished at moderate [Ca 2 +]cyt (10 μm), as determined in myocytes from calsequestrin-null versus wild-type mice. Our results suggest that under conditions of continuous activation by cytosolic Ca 2 +, RyR 2 s can periodically cycle between open and <b>deactivated</b> <b>states</b> due to effects of luminal Ca 2 +.

Measurement of the relative viscosity of mixtures of enzyme and quinacillin at 8. 4 degrees C ruled out any significant difference in shape or solvation between the deactivated and the normal enzyme. C. d. measurements of the deactivated protein, separated from excess quinacillin, showed that the quinacillin side-chain chromophore was bound in an asymmetric environment. The ellipticity associated with the bound quinacillin chromophore decreased with the same first-order rate constant as that for reappearance of enzyme activity. These findings support the accumulation of a <b>deactivated</b> <b>state</b> that contains bound quinacillin or a derivative.

The interpretation that quinacillin increases the susceptibility of the native state to unfolding in the presence of urea is supported by the demonstration that SO 4 (2) - ions decreased the rate and extent of deactivation but had no effect on the rate of re-activation, as predicted from the observation that SO 4 (2) - ions, in competition with urea, stabilize the native state relative to the partially unfolded state H [Mitchinson & Pain (1985) J.

A side project is summarized as an appendix describing the synthesis of various heteroaromatic ligands with potential use in platinum photochemistry. ^ The copper(II) porphyrin derivatives in Chapter 1 offer insight into the emitting and <b>deactivating</b> <b>state</b> associated with these complexes. The data show that the variation in the lifetime of the emitting π-π state is not due to thermal population of another excited state of charge-transfer parentage as was previously thought to be the case. Based on the findings herein, we favor the model supporting a vibronic distortion to explain the decrease in lifetime over the series. ^ Previous researchers have noted that sterics play an important role for copper(I) phenanthroline photochemistry. Currently, we have been focusing on the steric effects of remote methyl group both on the R-group in the 2 and 9 positions of phenanthroline {{as well as on the}} phenanthroline ligand itself.
