The legislation, which is {{described}} as the biggest change in the state's teacher retirement system in a generation, allows school districts to allocate less towards retirement pensions and more towards students. School district leaders have noted the change to retirement pension requirements have been a blessing, saying the separation allows school districts to spend more on school operations. The reform also created the option <b>for</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>to</b> commit more towards their own retirement, or have the option for a smaller pension.|$|E

At retirement, teachers receive $30 per unused sick day and can receive, through district funding, 40% of final salary retirement bonus and health insurance until age 65.

Groups may change frequently and are not static groups for the entire school year. Student groups change throughout the year based on assessed performance and not on teacher perceived ability. Each group has a purpose and the teacher plans instructional lessons based on the common needs of the group. Guided instruction gives the teacher an opportunity to differentiated instruction small group instruction, vary the level of prompting and also vary the end product. The teacher must be flexible since the instructional goal of the group may change throughout the sessions.|$|E
