25|$|Lealholm {{remained}} a traditional, labour-intensive, mixed farming community until the 1970s. In {{the second half}} of twentieth century increasing mechanization of farming operations led to a rapid <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> opportunities in agriculture in the surrounding area. However, the rise in the ownership of cars brought tourism into the North York Moors area and the village is a tourist honeypot in the summer months. Employment in tourism has risen rapidly and the village now has guest houses, holiday cottages, bed and breakfast accommodation and catering establishments providing jobs and income along with services and retailers. Lealholm had a typical NER goods shed and coal yard close to the railway station, which became a factory base when the company Lightspeed panels were set up in 1972. They produced the Magenta kit car, a fiberglass body kit based on a Mini chassis. Today the site is a car repair garage.|$|E

50|$|Detroit's {{depopulation}} did {{not occur}} overnight, but slowly over a series of decades. Shrinkage is also not a new phenomenon, and is often the converse side of growth. However, shrinkage in Detroit today occurs {{in stark contrast to}} the accelerated expansion of other large cities in America. Jianping and Yasushi argue that an initial cause of depopulation can be due to out-migration, lower fertility rates, and changes in residential preferences or accessibility that lead to suburbanization. The <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> as auto makers moved to cheaper property also caused depopulation, as residents moved away from the city or even state to seek jobs.|$|E

50|$|The American Workforce {{has become}} {{increasingly}} specialized {{in the last century}} developing from a mix of agricultural and industrial jobs to greater specialization among American workers. The growth of outsourcing of American jobs to countries such as China and other nations of Southeast Asia has been linked to the <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> opportunities for Americans from low-income, urban communities who once were the employee base for the American industrial sector. Over the last 15 years, however, the number of outsourced has increased by 23%. This development has had a significant effect on the employment prospects of certain sectors of the American population, most notably on those of low socio-economic status.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} prospective {{changes in}} employment {{associated with the}} expected expansion of trade in manufactured goods between the developed and developing countries over the next decade. It appears that, on balance, the developed countries would experience net employment creation {{as a result of}} this trade, and there would be only relatively small <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in their import-substituting industries. In turn, the developing countries would gain employment through increased export that would further contribute to their economic growth, with favorable indirect effects on employment...|$|E

This paper attempts to improve upon previous aggregate studies of labour-market change with a detailed questionnaire survey of the economically active in the Southampton city-region. The research suggests that the <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in both manufacturing and public services, together with the expansion of employment in private sector services, has been associated with trends towards dualism in respect of incomes, promotion prospects, fringe benefits, skill levels, job security and levels of job satisfaction. ...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. {{temporary}} help services (THS) industry grew at 11 {{percent annually}} between 1979 – 1995, {{five times more}} rapidly than non-farm employment. Contemporaneously, courts in 46 states adopted exceptions to the common law doctrine of employment at will that limit employers ’ discretion to terminate workers and opened them to litigation. This paper assesses whether the <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> at will {{and the growth of}} THS are causally related. To aid the analysis, the paper considers a simple model of employment outsourcing, the primary implication of which is that firms will respond to externally imposed firing costs by outsourcing positions requiring the least firm-specific skills rather than those with the highest expected termination costs. The empirical analysis indicates that one class of exception, the implied contractual right to ongoing employment, led to 14 – 22 percent excess temporary help growth in adopting states. Unjust dismissal doctrines did not significantly contribute to employment growth in other business service industries. Temporary help employment is closely correlated with union penetration, with states experiencing the least rapid decline in unionization undergoing substantially faster THS growth. The <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> at will explains as much as 20 percent of the growth of THS between 1973 – 1995 and accounts for 336, 000 to 494, 000 additional workers employed in THS on a daily basis as of 1999...|$|E

The thesis showed that the public service reproduced social relations privileging non-Indigenous executives while positioning Indigenous executives as deficient. The thesis explains how the everydayness of racism assumes the racial neutrality of institutions because the concept of race is externalised as only having relevance to the racial other. Non-Indigenous executives regard Indigeneity as being synonymous with inferiority to explain Indigenous disadvantage. Consequently, the Indigenous experience of everyday racism is perpetuated and contributes to <b>declining</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>employment...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{analyze the}} {{development}} of employment in start-up cohorts, which is the direct gross employment effect of the new businesses. The data is for West Germany and covers the 1984 – 2002 period. While total employment in the cohorts remains above the initial level in manufacturing, we find a pronounced <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> below this level in the ser-vice sector. Only {{a small fraction of}} the firms create a consid-erable amount of jobs.

40|$|Based on a {{comparison}} of the employment trajectories of two cohorts {{of men and women in}} the agricultural sector in Sweden, this article gives an account of the past 50 years’ decline in employment in agriculture. The findings show that the <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in agriculture was the result of fewer entries into the sector and more exits out of the sector. The findings also suggest that the restructuring of the agricultural sector has had greater effects on women than men, with women exiting the sector to a greater degree or never entering it to begin with...|$|E
40|$|While {{recent years}} have {{witnessed}} a growing interest in research on market entry by new firms, evidence regarding their postentry performance is scarce. This paper uses longitudinal data for small firms that entered German manufacturing industries between 1979 and 1982 and monitors their performance until 1990. Entrants face a high risk of failure, hazard rates tend to increase during the first years and to decrease afterwards. <b>Decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in a cohort due to exits and shrinking firms is compensated by growing survivors.

40|$|Much {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} the <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> traditional <b>employment</b> structures in the advanced industrial countries.

They then examine the resilience <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> security norms under recent economic pressures. They find there has been substantial erosion in employment security during the 1990 s in all four countries due to both increased competition and economic liberalization, although there is some variation in both the rate of erosion as well as the prospects for revival of the social contract. They assess the possibilities of a revival in this particular social contract, and the impact of the erosion on unorganized workers...|$|R

Regression analysis is used to highlight {{that there is no}} evidence for the trends previously found in North America, in fact the opposite appears to be true. From 1978 to 1991 deindustrialization was seen to be a contributing factor to diversification and the associated <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> Those centres which displayed growth from 1978 to 1991 were apparently those places which became more sectorally specialized, albeit from a relatively diverse initial position.

40|$|This article takes a long-view of {{the huge}} rise in {{disability}} claimant numbers in the UK since the early 1980 s and looks ahead to the trends that can now be expected to emerge {{in an era of}} fiscal austerity and welfare reform. The article's central thesis is that disability numbers are best understood as part of a triangular relationship between levels <b>of</b> <b>employment,</b> unemployment and sickness. In particular, the big <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> industrial <b>employment</b> in many places has often resulted in large-scale 'hidden unemployment' on disability benefits, especially among low-skilled workers. Looking ahead, the UK's welfare reforms are set to reduce disability claimant numbers but principally by restricting access to Employment and Support Allowance, the new disability benefit. The main effect will be to divert substantial numbers of men and women with ill health or disability onto unemployment benefits instead or, more often, out of the benefits system altogether...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of agricultural productivity gains on the industrialization process and on the long run growth rate of the economy. The model used for analysis allows endogenous gains in agricultural productivity via learning-by- doing and, besides that, {{it is assumed that}} accumulated experience in the manufacture sector exerts a positive impact on agricultural productivity. With this apparatus it is shown that a necessary condition to the <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> industrial <b>employment</b> is due to comparative advantage in agriculture, and {{that the rest of the}} world's economy has a poor industry/agriculture integration. Following Redding (1999) it is also shown that interventionist trategic policies can reverse specialization induced by starting comparative advantages and to increase welfare gains. ...|$|R
