50|$|Pontoon Beach is {{a growing}} town with more homes and businesses, {{including}} Gateway Commercial Business Center, a Flying J truckstop, and Hen House. The village has Grigsby Middle School located nearby in Granite City. Pontoon Beach has built a new City Hall and Police Department {{in the last three}} years, and more hotels, restaurants, and gas stations have been also built. There is a 3/8 mile Tri City Speedway raceway located off Highway 203 near the village. The dirt race track was a 1/2 and 1/4 mile complex until construction began on the new 3/8 mile dirt track in December 2006. The track features weekly modifieds, late models, street stocks, and <b>factory</b> <b>stocks</b> with occasional Sprint Car and go kart racing. Mike Pagano of Village Independence Party is the mayor.|$|E
50|$|During {{the mid to}} late 1980s, {{the three}} {{prominent}} divisions at Southside Speedway were the Late Model Stock Cars, Grand Stocks and Mini Stocks. The elite of Southside Speedway's limelight through the 1980s was shared by the rivalry between Wayne Patterson and Roy Hendrick, but Bugs Hairfield, Roger Sawyer, David Blankenship and Eddie Johnson was always in competition, and passed the track championship around throughout the decade. On Saturdays in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the track would often feature an enduro race that would include upwards of 80 cars racing in a 100-lap melee. These races were incredibly hard to keep up with, as the track was constantly completely congested with cars. The track would also feature a number of other divisions on certain occasions, including Modifieds, Pure Stocks, <b>Factory</b> <b>Stocks,</b> Go-Karts, and many others.|$|E
5000|$|The Street Stock {{division}} is {{the evolution of}} the old Enduro Races on Saturdays brought to Southside Speedway by Joe Kelly in the mid-80's. During the late 1980s, Southside began experimenting with an Enduro-type class on Friday nights by bringing the <b>Factory</b> <b>Stocks</b> to Southside once or twice a year. When the Enduro races became a Friday night feature at Southside, they were brought on as Street Stocks and eventually became the Southside Chargers. After the series was changed back to Street Stock for several years, they were disbanded for a few years. They were brought back in the mid-2000s, being known as the [...] "Enduro" [...] division and was meant as a no-holds-barred, anything-goes division. After the apparent need for some safety considerations were met, the Enduro cars were fitted with roll cages, the rules were changed and the division became known as Street Stocks again.|$|E

5000|$|Of these about 288 were in front-line {{service at}} the {{beginning}} of the Battle of France, with the three armoured divisions of the Cavalry, the Divisions Légères Mécaniques or Mechanised Light Divisions ("light" [...] here meaning [...] "mobile"). Each of these had an organic strength of eight squadrons with ten S35s; each squadron however had a matériel reserve of two tanks and regimental and brigade commanders in practice had personal tanks too, resulting in a total of 88 vehicles per division. Furthermore, 31 were present in the general matériel reserve, 49 in <b>factory</b> <b>stocks</b> and 26 were being processed for acceptance. These vehicles were later issued to several ad hoc units, such as the 4th DCR (commanded by Charles de Gaulle) which received 39, part of 3e Cuirassiers, the 4th DLM (10), and some Corps-francs Motorisés (about 25). Also the destroyed 1st, 2nd and 3rd DLM were reconstituted with a small number of tanks, the first two divisions received ten S 35s, the third twenty; S 35s further served with the 7e Cuirassiers (25) and a platoon of three was present in the 3e RAM of the 3e DLC.In May 1940 during the Battle of France the DLMs were tasked with the difficult manoevre of carrying out a quick advance into the Low Countries, followed by a holding action to allow the infantry divisions following behind to dig themselves in. The 2nd and 3rd DLM were concentrated in the Gembloux gap between Louvain and Namur, where there were no natural obstacles to impede a German advance. They had to spread out somewhat to hold that sector against incursions by the German 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions. This was necessitated by the local tactical situation and did not reflect some fundamental difference in doctrine between the use of the DLMs and the Panzerdivisionen. Both types of units were very similar in equipment, training and organisation, as the German armoured divisions too were primarily intended for strategic exploitation, while the breakthrough phase was preferably left to the infantry. The resulting tank battle from 13 to 15 May, the Battle of Hannut, was with about 1700 AFVs participating the largest until that day and is still one of the largest of all time. The S 35s gave a good account of themselves, proving to be indeed superior to the German tanks in direct combat, but they were rather hesitantly deployed as the French High Command mistakenly supposed the gap was the German Schwerpunkt and tried to preserve their best tanks to block subsequent attacks by the rest of the Panzerwaffe.|$|E

5000|$|Markets {{became the}} {{dominant}} coordination mechanism following price liberalization and the de-control of foreign trade that permitted {{more or less}} unrestricted importation of goods in 1990/92. Queues at retail outlets disappeared as did hoarded inventories at <b>factories.</b> <b>Stock</b> exchanges were established between 1990 and 1995. Anti-monopoly legislation was introduced. As workers lost their jobs or found their wages unpaid, informal labour markets sprang up along certain streets, particularly for construction trades.|$|R

5|$|Other common changes {{include the}} {{replacement}} of the <b>factory</b> <b>stock</b> tires with rain tires or mud and snow tires and the shortening of the vehicle's wheelbase to improve maneuverability. For smaller applications smaller trucks are used. In Canada pickup trucks are used with snow removal operations with a blade mounted in front and optional de-icing equipment installed in the rear. Underbody scrapers are also used by some agencies and are mounted between axles, distributing plowing stresses on the chassis more evenly.|$|R

5000|$|The main building, {{designed}} for the Bender carpet factory (in 1908 renamed to Warszawska Akcyjna Fabryka Dywanów - Warsaw Carpet <b>Factory</b> <b>Stock</b> Company), occupied {{the entire length of}} the Polna street side, with a smaller reception building constructed along Marszałkowska. Because of that it received a dual address: Marszałkowska 3/5 and Polna 4/6. Nearby, at Marszałkowska 8 (Polna 8) a three-story administrative building was constructed. The carpet factory went bankrupt in 1915, after Warsaw had been cut off from its main markets in Imperial Russia by the frontlines of World War I.|$|R

Additionally, previous models such as the Swinger (also known as Musiclander) and Custom (also known as Maverick) were perceived by some musicians {{as little more than}} attempts to squeeze profits out of <b>factory</b> <b>stock.</b> The so-called [...] "pre-CBS cult" [...] refers to the popularity of Fenders made before the sale.|$|R

5000|$|The Fender Custom (or Maverick) was a {{short-lived}} model {{released by the}} CBS-owned Fender in 1969. Essentially a six-string Fender Electric XII, the Custom {{was an attempt to}} sell off unused <b>factory</b> <b>stock</b> instead of simply writing it off. The guitar was made with unused parts from Electric XII guitars, including the body, pickups and neck, and also unused Fender Mustang bridges. The six extra holes in the headstock for the tuning machines were filled and veneered over. The Custom was featured more prominently in sales material than its companion, the Swinger, but sold poorly, and was never expected to compete with Fender's more popular models.|$|R

Porsche, not necessarily a rival car manufacturer, has claimed Nissan overstated the GT-R's performance in September 2008. Porsche, unusually, claims to have conducted a test of a <b>factory</b> <b>stock,</b> European market GT-R and achieved a slower time (of 7:54), apparently implying that the car isn't as fast around this public road as Nissan claims and/or that their driver isn't as talented as Nissans.
