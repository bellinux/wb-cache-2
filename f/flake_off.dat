5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules deflated, and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to <b>flake</b> <b>off,</b> leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} group 8 elements, {{ruthenium}} and osmium, iron exists {{in a wide range}} of oxidation states, −2 to +7, although +2 and +3 are the most common. Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to oxygen and water. Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the metals that form passivating oxide layers, iron oxides occupy more volume than the metal and thus <b>flake</b> <b>off,</b> exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes {{when exposed to}} air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon and hydrogen. When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn <b>flake</b> <b>off</b> as a powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.|$|E

5|$|Etty {{had used}} {{experimental}} techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to <b>flake</b> <b>off</b> once dry, a problem {{made worse by}} the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in {{the archives of the}} Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century {{there were a number of}} unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.|$|E

50|$|The Suisun Bay {{location}} contained 324 {{ships in}} 1959. Forty years later, {{the number was}} down by about 250, but pollutants had begun to accumulate in the area. Paint containing toxins such as lead, copper, zinc and barium had been <b>flaking</b> <b>off</b> many of the ships' hulls and superstructures. By June 2007, some 21 tons of toxic paint debris was estimated to have been shed from the ships, to settle in the bay sediment.

25|$|Antifouling {{coatings}} {{are often}} used on nylon nets because the process is more economical than manual cleaning. When nylon nets are coated with antifouling compounds, the coatings repel biofouling {{for a period of}} time, usually between several weeks to several months. However, the nets eventually succumb to biofouling. Antifouling coatings containing cuprous oxide algaecide/biocide are the coatings technology used almost exclusively in the fish farming industry today. The treatments usually <b>flake</b> <b>off</b> within a few weeks to six to eight months.|$|E
25|$|The amber bulbs {{commonly}} used in turn signals with colourless lenses are no longer made with cadmium glass, since various regulations worldwide, including the European RoHS directive, banned cadmium because of its toxicity. Amber glass made without cadmium is relatively costly, so most amber bulbs are now made with clear glass dipped in an amber coating. Some of these coatings are not as durable as the bulb envelopes; with prolonged heat-cool cycles, the coating may <b>flake</b> <b>off</b> the bulb glass, or its colour may fade. This causes the turn signal to emit white light, rather than the required amber light.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the skin}} layers {{continually}} replaces itself, cells are pushed outward where they die and <b>flake</b> <b>off.</b> [...] For most individuals, these flakes of skin {{are too small}} to be visible. [...] However, certain conditions cause cell turnover to be unusually rapid, especially in the scalp. It is hypothesized that for people with dandruff, skin cells may mature and be shed in 2–7 days, as opposed to around a month in people without dandruff. [...] The result is that dead skin cells are shed in large, oily clumps, which appear as white or grayish flakes on the scalp, skin and clothes.|$|E
2500|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, the paint/stain layer {{may suffer}} {{as the result}} of deterioration within the fabric of the glass itself; however, this fragile layer is at risk for other types of damage as well. [...] Painted surfaces that would have been applied to glass cold and fired on, are especially vulnerable to damage from condensation or weathering, if they were fired improperly during the production process (Vogel 2007, 7). [...] This is often the case with the fading or disappearance of fine detail, such as faces, in figural stained glass art (fig. 2). Over time, enamels can begin to <b>flake</b> <b>off</b> of glass panels, and certain types or colours of stains can discolour with continued UV exposure, all of which significantly alters the aesthetic impact of the work as a whole (Brown et al. 2002, 18-19; Vogel et al. 2007, 7).|$|E
50|$|Certain {{models of}} the Musicmaster, {{especially}} from between 1978 and 1980, were finished with a coat that reacted negatively with the base coat. This causes many modern surviving Musicmasters from this period to suffer from paint <b>flaking</b> <b>off</b> the body.|$|R
50|$|Care {{should be}} used for parts exposed to high {{humidity}} environments. When the silver layer is porous or contains cracks, the underlying copper undergoes rapid galvanic corrosion, <b>flaking</b> <b>off</b> the plating and exposing the copper itself; a process known as red plague.|$|R
