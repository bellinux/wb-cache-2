40|$|In this paper, a polarization-sensitive {{reflectometry}} {{technique has}} been investigated in order {{to serve as an}} interrogating device in distributed sensing applications. As the sensing fiber has a beat length of about a few centimeters, a high-resolution reflectometer was required. A coherent optical <b>frequency-domain</b> <b>reflectometer</b> (OFDR) was used from this perspective. The principle is based on the linear dependence of fiber beat length on temperature. The reported experimental results detail the calibration method and discuss the features of the interrogating device in terms of temperature threshold and spatial resolution. The proposed system, exploiting the Rayleigh backscatter signal, offers an interesting alternative to existing systems, mainly based on nonlinear effects...|$|E

Its reduction {{can be achieved by}} the spinning process that provokes the rotation of the birefringence axes of the fiber inciting a coupling of its modes that is controlled {{at the time of its}} manufacture. In this work, the Jones Matrix Eigen-Analysis method (JME) is used to characterize the spun fibers to evaluate their PMD and to prove that it is distinctly lower than the standards fibers PMD. Furthermore, the differential group delays (DGD) of spun fibers is determined using the photon counting optical time-domain reflectometry (C-OTDR) method. The obtained results are compared with those found in the JME method. It is noted that the two methods yield practically identical values. The determination of the beat length and the spin period of spun fibers are carried out using the polarization-sensitive optical <b>frequency-domain</b> <b>reflectometer</b> (POFD...|$|E
