40|$|Within any {{high-rise}} {{structure or}} underground/subway station, occupants often heavily rely on vertical <b>transport</b> <b>devices</b> (e. g. escalators, lifts, etc) to travel vertically between levels. Typically such devices provide a {{faster and more}} comfortable means to travel than the equivalent stairs. Such devices also provide an additional means for occupant egress. However, the provision for utilising such devices in actual buildings for evacuations is rare. Despite a select number of structures throughout the world allowing the use of vertical <b>transport</b> <b>devices</b> within evacuation scenarios, little is understood with regards to evacuation vertical transport strategies {{and to what extent}} such strategies may be influenced by associated human factors. This thesis is intended to address this lack of understanding. The thesis provides an in depth review of evacuation usage of vertical <b>transport</b> <b>devices</b> in actual evacuations, their provision in building codes, empirical studies analysing human factors, representation within simulated environments, and analysis of previously explored operational strategies. The review provides a broad set of research questions that the thesis is intended to address. Human factors data associated with vertical <b>transport</b> <b>device</b> usage have been collected via an online survey and video analysis. The data analysis has instructed the development of the vertical <b>transport</b> <b>device</b> models and associated agent models within the buildingEXODUS evacuation software. The models include the representation of device selection, the influence of local conditions in close proximity to a device, and the influence of wait time upon device selection. The developed models have been used to demonstrate the influence of different vertical transport strategies and to what extent such strategies are influenced by human factors. Finally, the thesis concludes by summarising the increased understanding achieved through the work presented...|$|R
40|$|Saline {{suspensions}} of 11 aerobes and anaerobes {{were used}} to inoculate swabs from Port-A-Cul (Becton Dickinson), Culturette EZ (Becton Dickinson), and Copan Amies gel (Copan Diagnostics).

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a new {{continuously variable transmission}} (CVT) {{that may be used}} in a variety of machines and <b>transport</b> <b>devices.</b> Unlike many CVTs that are relatively heavy and bulky, the present CVT, named “eDrive”, is fairly small and lightweight. These attributes allow eDrive to be used in human-powered <b>transport</b> <b>devices</b> such as bicycles. The eDrive incorporates a sprocket able to vary its effective diameter via computer controlled actuation. The sprocket accommodates a rotational input and provides an output using a loop belt rotationally engaged with sprocket. The eDrive promises to increase a bicyclist's user experience, provide more efficient conversion of human energy to locomotion, and overall promote sustainable urban transportation. In addition, eDrive can be configured and scaled to provide CVT functionality for a variety of other vehicles and machines, such as wind or water turbines and electric vehicles...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} to providing communication links between independent scientific applications. Important problems to solve include data and control integration. Solving these problems separately {{is an essential}} aspect of the design and implementation of a protocol for mathematics. The Multi Protocol (MP) specification addresses the exchange of mathematical data by focusing only on the data encoding issues. In this way, MP can be plugged into various existing data transport mechanisms addressing control integration, or augmented by a higher control-related protocol layer. Our implementation of MP is independent of the data transport mechanism and can work with several devices. An application puts/gets data to/from MP buffers which communicate with the <b>transport</b> <b>device</b> through an abstract device interface. This paper describes the general design of the interface between MP and a <b>transport</b> <b>device</b> and the lessons we have learned during its implementation. 1 Introduction and M [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Organic {{semiconductors}} find increasing {{importance in}} spin <b>transport</b> <b>devices</b> {{due to the}} modulation and control of their properties through chemical synthetic versatility. The organic materials are used as interlayers between two ferromagnet (FM) electrodes in organic spin valves (OSV), {{as well as for}} magnetic spin manipulation of metal-organic complexes at the molecular level. In the latter, specifically, the substrate-induced magnetic switching in a paramagnetic molecule has been evoked extensively, but studied by delicate surface spectroscopies. Here we present evidence of the substantial magnetic switching in a nanosized thin film of the paramagnetic molecule, tris(8 -hydroxyquinoline) iron(III) (Feq 3) deposited on a FM substrate, using the magnetoresistance response of electrical spin-injection in an OSV structure, and the inverse-spin-Hall effect induced by state-of-art pulsed microwave spin-pumping. We show that interfacial spin control at the molecular level may lead to a macroscopic organic spin <b>transport</b> <b>device,</b> thus, bridging the gap between organic spintronics and molecular spintronics...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an electronic transport model and an implementation approach that {{respond to the}} challenges of device modeling for gigascale integration. We use the density-gradient (DG) transport model, which adds tunneling and quantum smoothing of carrier density profiles to the driftdiffusion model. We present the current implementation of the DG model in PROPHET, a partial differential equation solver developed by Lucent Technologies. This implementation approach permits rapid development and enhancement of models, as well as run-time modifications and model switching. We show that even in typical bulk <b>transport</b> <b>devices</b> such as P-N diodes and BJTs, DG quantum effects can significantly modify the I-V characteristics. Quantum effects are shown to be even more significant in small, surface <b>transport</b> <b>devices,</b> such as sub- 0. 1 µm MOSFETs. In thin-oxide MOS capacitors, we find that quantum effects may reduce gate capacitance by 25 % or more. The inclusion of quantum effects in simulations dramat [...] ...|$|R
