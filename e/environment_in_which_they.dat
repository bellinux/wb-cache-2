5|$|By {{repeated}} scanning, bats can mentally {{construct an}} accurate {{image of the}} <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are moving and of their prey item. However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce signals to jam bat echolocation. Many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{studying}} the horses rate their body condition {{on a scale}} of one (excellent) to five (very poor), based mainly on estimated weight and muscle tone. The horses tend to remain in above average condition, despite the harsh <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> live, with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares. During severe droughts, the average body score decreases, but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition. The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall, through a correlation to available forage, though temperature, distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role. Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites. Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present (strongyles, small and large pinworms and Ascarids), as well as the larvae of botflys.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} colors, {{depending}} on the <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> form. Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris {{at the base of the}} funnel. Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of algae that are intentionally cultivated {{fall into the}} category of microalgae (also referred to as phytoplankton, microphytes, or planktonic algae). Macroalgae, commonly known as seaweed, also have many commercial and industrial uses, but due to their size and the specific requirements of the <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> need to grow, they do not lend themselves as readily to cultivation (this may change, however, with the advent of newer seaweed cultivators, which are basically algae scrubbers using upflowing air bubbles in small containers).|$|E

Some early examples of this involved aviation medicine and the use of helicopters, and the transfer of critical care patients between facilities. While some jurisdictions still use physicians, nurses, and technicians for transporting patients, increasingly this role falls to specialized senior and experienced paramedics. Other areas of specialization include such roles as tactical paramedics working in police units, marine paramedics, hazardous materials (Hazmat) teams, Heavy Urban Search and Rescue, and paramedics on offshore oil platforms, oil and mineral exploration teams, and in the military.|$|E

25|$|Hussein {{decried the}} morale of those in his {{generation}} who sought to simply make a living instead of fighting for their rights. However, he did not blame this perceived submissiveness and aimlessness solely on the Arab youth themselves, but to the <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> grew up, with many having lived through the Nakba ("the Catastrophe"), the term used for the Palestinian exodus {{as a result of}} the establishment of Israel, and the ensuing 1948 Arab-Israeli War. According to Hussein, the neighboring Arab states reacted to the Palestinian Arab calamity by replacing their old leadership. However, in the case of the Palestinians in Israel, the old leadership was restored to control the Arab community on behalf of the state.|$|E
25|$|When {{standing}} upright, the Aliens are bipedal in form, though {{depending on}} their host species, they will either adopt a more hunched stance, or remain quadrupedal when walking or sprinting. Their overall stance and general behavior {{is a result of}} the mixture of the DNA of the embryo and the host. They have a skeletal, biomechanical appearance and are usually colored in muted shades of black, gray or bronze. Their body heat matches the ambient temperature of the <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are found, so they do not radiate heat, making them indistinguishable from their surroundings through thermal imaging. In most of the films, adult Aliens are capable of running and crawling along ceilings and walls. They have great physical strength, having been shown to be capable of breaking through welded steel doors in numbers.|$|E
25|$|Stimulating the OFC in {{laboratory}} animals results in drug self-administration. In animal studies the OFC is hypothesized {{to not only}} {{be associated with the}} response to reward, but also to respond and adjust animal behavior when the rewarding properties of the reinforcement change - as well as learning the association between stimulus and reward. The damage to the OFC results in deficits in reversal of stimulus reinforcement in which an animal perseverates on a behavior and fails to extinguish a behavior. This perseveration and inability to extinguish a behavior can be related to drug administration in substance abuse and substance dependence where individuals compulsively self-administer a drug even with drastic decrease of reinforcing effects of that drug and tolerance to the pleasurable effects and in the presence of adverse consequences of drug use. Rats who are reintroduced to an <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> used cocaine experience activation of the OFC. In addition, in rats, repeated alcohol use causes degeneration of the OFC.|$|E

25|$|The Archean age greenstone belts {{throughout}} Canada {{are important}} for estimating Canada's mineral potential. Greenstone belts containing mineralogy are related to volcanic activity. Consequently, geologists study greenstone belts to understand the volcanoes and the <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> erupted, {{and to provide a}} working model for mineral exploration. The 1,904‑ to 1,864‑million-year-old Flin Flon greenstone belt of central Manitoba and east-central Saskatchewan {{is one of the largest}} Paleoproterozoic age volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposits in the world, containing 27copper-zinc-(gold) deposits from which more than 183million tonnes of sulfide ore have been mined. The 2,575‑million-year-old Yellowknife greenstone belt in the Northwest Territories is the host for world-class gold deposits with total production of 15million ounces of gold. In the Archean Hope Bay greenstone belt of western Nunavut, three large gold deposits have been known as Doris, Boston and Madrid, while the 2,677‑million-year-old Abitibi greenstone belt of Ontario and Quebec is the second most prolific gold producing area on Earth; the most prolific gold producing area is the Witwatersrand hill range in South Africa.|$|E
25|$|He {{established}} a solo practice in 1950, and incorporated as a firm in 1956. At first, {{he set a}} goal of applying Modernist architectural principles to major types of building. But his work soon reflected a desire to harmonize building designs with the <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were set as well as their cultural and historical setting, an architectural theory known as contextualism. Warnecke won national recognition in 1951 for the Mira Vista Elementary School in East Richmond Heights, California (a small residential community which overlooks the northern part of San Francisco Bay). Other schools in the San Francisco Bay are followed, earning him much praise. Warnecke became an internationally recognized architect after submitting a design for a new U.S. embassy in Thailand in 1956 (it was never built). He reorganized his firm in 1958 under the name John Carl Warnecke & Associates, the name it would be best known by. He was named an Associate of the National Academy of Design the same year. He won additional notice for buildings at Stanford University (built in the 1960s) and the University of California, Berkeley (built in the 1960s and early 1970s).|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, {{the levels}} of service {{available}} will {{fall into one of}} three categories; Basic Life Support (BLS), Advanced Life Support (ALS), and Critical Care Transport (CCT) by traditional healthcare professionals, meaning nurses and/or physicians working in the pre-hospital setting and even on ambulances. In some jurisdictions, a fourth level, Intermediate Life Support (ILS), which is essentially a BLS provider with a moderately expanded skill set, may be present, but this level rarely functions independently, and where it is present may replace BLS in the emergency part of the service. When this occurs, any remaining staff at the BLS level is usually relegated to the non-emergency transportation function. Job titles typically include Emergency Medical Technician, Ambulance Technician, or Paramedic. These ambulance care givers are generally professionals or paraprofessionals and in some countries their use is controlled through training and registration. While these job titles are protected by legislation in some countries, this protection is by no means universal, and anyone might, for example, call themselves an 'EMT' or a 'paramedic', regardless of their training, or the lack of it. In some jurisdictions, both technicians and paramedics may be further defined by the <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> operate, including such designations as 'Wilderness', 'Tactical', and so on.|$|E
