50|$|The Tennessee Valley Authority {{maintains}} a self-service public campground below Watauga Dam. Amenities and recreational opportunities at the TVA Watauga Dam Tailwater Campground include 29 camp sites with electric hookups, rest rooms with heated showers and <b>flush</b> toilets, <b>dump</b> station, public phone, picnic tables and grills, canoe access, boat ramps {{above and below}} dam, lake and river fishing, hiking trail, walking trail, wildlife viewing area, birdwatching.|$|R
50|$|Sizerville State Park has a 23-site campground. Eighteen of {{the sites}} have an {{electrical}} hook-up. The campground facilities include a sanitary <b>dump,</b> <b>flush</b> toilets and showers. Those interested in camping in tents can hike into five sites {{that are on the}} bank of a creek.|$|R
50|$|Niagara Conservation also {{manufactures}} the Flapperless toilet, {{which uses}} a half-cylinder 1.6 gallon bucket instead of a flapper. When the toilet is <b>flushed,</b> the bucket <b>dumps</b> the water into the tank, initiating the flush. The flapper is the piece of common toilet technology that fails most often, without a flapper, a toilet {{is less likely to}} fail.|$|R
5000|$|As Betty {{returned}} to her desk, she sees Kimmie sitting there. Kimmie then asks for Betty's help in finding a job after she quit her job at <b>Flushing</b> Burger and <b>dumped</b> her boyfriend, saying {{that she wants to}} start anew and have the same success that Betty has. Betty initially reluctant to accept her idea, but after Daniel suggests to Betty that she hire a temporary assistant to help her and Kimmie jumps at the opportunity.|$|R
40|$|The LTC 1073 Vacuum Blasting Machine uses a high capacity, direct {{pressure}} {{blasting system}} incorporating a continuous feed for the blast media. The blast media cleans the surface within the contained brush {{area of the}} blast head. A vacuum system removes dust and debris from the surfaces as it is blasted. After cleaning the surface, the abrasive, together with the rust or coating that {{was removed from the}} surface, is vacuumed into the machine through the suction hose. The dust separator contains angled steel collision pads, working with the force of gravity, to allow any reusable abrasive to fall back into the pressure vessel. The filters are manually back flushed to prevent clogging. After back <b>flushing,</b> dust is <b>dumped</b> from the dust chamber into the dust collection bag or drum by operation of the bellows valve. The safety and health evaluation during the testing demonstration focused on dust and noise exposure. Dust exposure was found to be minimal, but noise exposure was potentially significant. Further testing for each of these exposures is recommended because the outdoor environment where the testing demonstration took place may cause the results to be inapplicable to indoor settings. It is feasible that the dust and noise levels will be higher in an enclosed operating environment. Other safety and health issues found were ergonomics, heat stress, tripping hazards, lockout/tagout, and arm-hand vibration...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the early}} 1970s the only {{effective}} means {{so far has}} been flushing sand onto the shore. Dredging vessels are used to pump a mixture of sand and water to a beach where it is spread by bulldozers. Thus storm floods would only erase the artificial accumulation of sand, while the shoreline proper remains intact and erosion is slowed down. This procedure incurs considerable costs. The required budget of an annual €10 million is currently provided by federal German, Schleswig-Holstein state and EU funds. Since 1972 an estimated 35.5 million cubic metres of sand have been <b>flushed</b> ashore and <b>dumped</b> on Sylt. The measures have so far cost more than €134 million in total, but according to scientific calculations they are sufficient to prevent further loss of land for at least three decades, so the benefits for the island's economic power and for the economically underdeveloped region in general would outweigh the costs. In the 1995 study Klimafolgen für Mensch und Küste am Beispiel der Nordseeinsel Sylt (Climate impact for Man and Shores as seen on the North Sea island Sylt) it reads: [...] "Hätte Sylt nicht das Image einer attraktiven Ferieninsel, gäbe es den Küstenschutz in der bestehenden Form gewiss nicht" [...] (If Sylt did not have the image of an attractive holiday island, coastal management in its current form would certainly not exist).|$|R
40|$|A 2008 Associated Press {{study of}} 28 major United States municipalities’ water {{provider}} testing results uncovered traces {{of a wide}} variety of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and antibiotics in 24 of the cities’ drinking water. These chemical compounds have been linked to two sources; the <b>flushing</b> or <b>dumping</b> of medications down the drain, and the passage of excess chemicals through the human body and into municipal wastewater. Municipal wastewater treatment plants do not have the technology or infrastructure to remove these chemicals from the water, so they enter a stream or river and are carried downstream. In the Animas River Basin, in and around Durango, Colorado no testing has been conducted for the presence of pharmaceutical compounds or endocrine disrupting chemicals. Many case studies have screened wastewater effluent and stream water for these chemicals throughout the country, the majority with similar results. A cooperative study with United States Geological Survey and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection of the Environmental Protection Agency tested streams near drinking water intakes in Pennsylvania in 2007. Over a three-year study, 27 drinking water intake sites were tested throughout the state. These intakes were tested for levels of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and antibiotics. All of the 27 sites had at least one compound detected. The most commonly detected pharmaceuticals were caffeine, Carbamazepine, (A mood stabilizing drug), Acetaminophen, antihistamines, and Cotinine, a derivative of nicotine. The most commonly detected hormones included Estrone, Androstene, 17 -beta estradiol, and Cis-androsterone, all human male and female hormones. All levels of contaminants were found at very minimal levels in the parts per trillion concentrations. Although low, these levels have been proven detrimental to wildlife. Aquatic species are most reactive to these chemicals and have been proven to intersex and stop reproduction altogether when introduced to certain human hormones like Estrone or Estradiol, common hormones in birth control. Emerging research has prompted the research and development of wastewater chemical removal methods such as Ozonation, Activated Carbon removal, and Forward Osmosis removal. This research suggests a screening of the Animas River needs to be conducted for the presence of pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors so solutions and prevention strategies can be implemented if needed...|$|R
