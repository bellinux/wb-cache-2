40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} 25 new {{experimental results}} from gray cast <b>iron</b> <b>notched</b> specimens tested under torsion loading. V-notch (with an opening angle of 120 °) is considered with a root radius ranging from 0. 1 to 2. 0 mm. Plots of torque loads versus twist angles are recorded varying the notch root radius. Such results {{can help in}} evaluating numerical and theoretical models of the fracture of notched components under mode III loading. The {{second part of the}} paper deals with a discussion on the experimental results. A non-conventional application of the strain energy density is carried out showing a good agreement between experimental results and theoretical fracture assessments and it is used to justify the link between nominal and local fracture approaches...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the fatigue strength of forged steels with the fatigue strength of graphite cast <b>iron</b> in <b>notched</b> condition. The influence of different post treatments like cold rolling and induction hardening on the fatigue behavior is compared. While induction hardening renders better fatigue properties for steels than for cast materials, cold rolling results for cast iron a better behavior then for steel...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold and {{therefore}} it has been divided in two parts. In the first part, experimental results of 25 gray cast <b>iron</b> <b>notched</b> specimens tested under torsion loading are provided. V-notch (with an opening angle of 120 °) geometry is considered with root radii ranging from 0. 1 to 2. 0. mm. Plots of torque loads versus twist angles are recorded for all notch root radii tested. Such results can help in evaluating numerical and theoretical models for fracture of notched components under mode III loading. The second part of the paper deals with an analysis of the experimental results by using the Strain Energy Density criterion. Because of the mode III loading conditions, a non-conventional application of such criterion is carried out, showing a good agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical fracture assessments and it is used to justify the link between nominal and local fracture approaches...|$|R

The pistol is completely ambidextrous and two-handed use is enhanced {{through the use}} of a profiled and enlarged trigger guard.|$|R
5000|$|Daedalus was {{so proud}} of his {{achievements}} that he could not bear the idea of a rival. His sister, sometimes named as Perdix, had placed her son (variously named Perdix, Talos, or Calos) under his charge to be taught the mechanical arts. He was an apt scholar and showed striking evidence of ingenuity. While walking on the seashore, he picked up the spine of a fish, or a serpent's jaw. Imitating it, he took a piece of <b>iron</b> and <b>notched</b> it on the edge, thus inventing the saw. He made a pair of compasses by putting two pieces of iron together, connecting them at one end with a rivet, and sharpening the other ends.|$|R

An iron ring, contrived so as when drawn up and down to rattle against the bar of <b>notched</b> <b>iron</b> through which it was suspended, served the purpose of a knocker; and to this he applied himself, though with the greatest precaution.|$|R
50|$|On 27 March the Jacobites unmasked {{a battery}} of four 6-pounder pieces on the ground above the Governor's garden, and so the {{emphasis}} of attack shifted from the mortars to the cannon. On the 28 March the Jacobites opened up an artillery attack east of the fort with red-hot shot {{with the aim of}} making the cramped interior of the fort untenable. Further missiles included cold roundshot, grapeshot, old nails and red-hot lengths of <b>notched</b> <b>iron</b> that were intended to lodge in the timbers, and were a Jacobite speciality.|$|R

40|$|In {{cylinder}} heads of compacted graphite iron (CGI), the {{heating and cooling}} cycles can lead to localized cracking due to thermomechanical fatigue (TMF). Traditionally, TMF behavior is studied by thermal cycling of smooth specimens. The resulting number of cycles to failure (N (f)) constitutes a single parameter {{that can be used}} to predict actual service failures. Nevertheless, there are also some drawbacks of the conventional testing procedures, most noticeably the prolonged testing times and a considerable scatter in test results. To address these drawbacks, TMF tests were performed using notched specimens, resulting in shorter testing times with less scatter. In the case of cast <b>iron,</b> artificial <b>notches</b> do not necessarily change the TMF behavior since the inherent graphite particles behave as internal notches. Using a notch depth of 0. 2 mm, the effect of prolonged holding times (HT) on TMF lifetime was studied and a clear effect was found. Extended holding times were also found to be accompanied by relaxation of compressive stresses, causing higher tensile stresses to develop in the subsequent low temperature stages of the TMF cycles. The lifetimes in notched CGI specimens can be predicted by the Paris' fatigue crack growth model. This model was used to differentiate between the individual effects of stress level and holding times on TMF lifetime. Microstructural changes were evaluated by analyzing quantitative data sets obtained by orientation contrast microscopy based on electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{house had}} a PIN or RISP at the door, {{instead of the}} more modern convenience--a knocker. The pin, {{rendered}} interesting by the figure which it makes in Scottish song, was formed of a small rod of <b>iron,</b> twisted or <b>notched,</b> which was placed perpendicularly, starting out a little from the door, and bore a small ring of the same metal, which an applicant for admittance drew rapidly {{up and down the}} NICKS, so as to produce a grating sound. Sometimes the rod was simply stretched across the VIZZYING hole, a convenient aperture through which the porter could take cognisance of the person applying; in which case it acted also as a stanchion. These were almost all disused about sixty years ago, when knockers were generally substituted as more genteel. But knockers at that time did not long remain in repute, though they have never been altogether superseded, even by bells, in the Old Town. The comparative merit of knockers and pins was for a long time a subject of doubt, and many knockers got their heads twisted off {{in the course of the}} dispute."--CHAMBERS'S TRADITIONS OF EDINBURGH.|$|R
