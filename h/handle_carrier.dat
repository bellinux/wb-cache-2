40|$|A {{proof of}} concept on-/off- keying (OOK) {{modulator}} is designed and implemented in a commercial heterojunction bipolar transistors IC process. The modulator circuit consists of an amplifier/latch structure, which is used as an OOK modulator for the first time. One of its advantages is that the topology may be implemented in both field effect transistor and bipolar technology. The measurement results correspond well with simulation and show that the modulator is capable of <b>handling</b> <b>carrier</b> frequencies up to 28 GHz, and data rates up to 14 Gbps. The isolation of the modulator in the off-state is better than 27 dB over the whole frequency range...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the usefulness of}} simulation in studying the impacts of system failures and delays on the output and cycle time of finished weldments produced by a robotic work cell having both serial and parallel processes.

The model replicates a non-terminating welding fabrication system with duplicate stochastic events caused by system failures and delays. A full factorial model is employed and analyzed to examine the main and interaction effects of five major types of system failures and delays via multiple regression analysis. The analysis derived from the full factorial model shows that material <b>handling</b> <b>carrier</b> delays have the most significant impact on the cycle time. This case study illustrates a modeling approach with system verification and validation revealing fundamental system design flaws which cause a significant loss of production...|$|R

40|$|A {{reversible}} <b>handle</b> on graphene <b>carrier</b> density, {{other than}} the gate electric field, is desirable for memory applications of graphene. Our experiments show that the commonly observed carrier density hysteresis in graphene on SiO$_ 2 $ due to interface water/oxygen vanishes at temperatures below 250 K. The state of these species, which affects the graphene carrier density, at low temperatures can be reversibly controlled by thermal cycling to room temperature at different gate voltages. Further, devices prepared with relatively dry interface, and thus showing negligible hysteresis at room temperature, show a marked increase in hysteresis on heating above room temperature. Thus thermal-cycling, to high temperatures and under gate-voltage, provides a reversible <b>handle</b> on <b>carrier</b> density. These results are {{discussed in terms of}} temperature and interface-water density dependence of redox-reaction kinetics. Comment: 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{analytical}} approach for the availability evaluation of cellular manufacturing systems is presented, where a manufacturing system is considered operational {{as long as}} its production capacity requirements are satisfied. The advantage of the approach is that constructing a system level Markov chain (a complex task) is not required. A manufacturing system is decomposed into two subsystems, i. e., machining system and material handling system. The machining subsystem is in turn decomposed into machine cells. For each machine cell and material handling subsystem, a Markovian model is derived and solved to find {{the probability of a}} subset of working machines in each cell, and a subset of the operating material <b>handling</b> <b>carriers</b> that satisfies the manufacturing capacity requirements. The overall manufacturing system availability is obtained using a procedure presented in the paper. The novelty of the approach is that it incorporates imperfect coverage and imperfect repair factors in the Markovian models. The approach is used to evaluate transient and steady-state performance of three alternative designs based on an industrial example. Detailed discussion of the results and the impact of imperfect coverage and imperfect repair on the availability of manufacturing system is presented. Possible extensions of the work and software tools available for model analysis are also discussed...|$|R

25|$|The F-111B was an {{all-weather}} {{interceptor aircraft}} intended to defend U.S. Navy carrier battle groups against bombers and anti-ship missiles. The F-111 features variable geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with {{side by side}} seating. The cockpit {{is part of an}} escape crew capsule. The wing sweep varies between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). The airframe consisted mostly of aluminum alloys with steel, titanium and other materials also used.

The F-111B was powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 afterburning turbofan engines and included the AN/AWG-9 radar system for controlling the AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missiles. Poor visibility over the nose made the aircraft more difficult to <b>handle</b> for <b>carrier</b> operations.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{deals with}} {{nonlinear}} simulation methods intended {{to evaluate the}} impact of mixer nonidealities {{on the performance of}} a wireless system. Behavioral models capable of accurately describing the mixer’s nonlinear dynamic features at the system level are currently unavailable. The possibility of using alternative circuit analysis techniques to reach this goal is discussed. After a brief review of existing mixer analysis methods, the focus is directed to the techniques amenable to efficiently <b>handling</b> periodic <b>carriers</b> modulated by complex stochastic signals. In particular, it is shown how multi-envelope transient methods coupled with a three-dimensional harmonic-balance engine can model a nonlinear dynamic mixer excited by a modulated RF signal accompanied by a strong adjacent channel interferer and with a local oscillator corrupted by phase noise. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
