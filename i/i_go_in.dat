In June 2001, she and frequent collaborator soprano Jessye Norman performed Vangelis' Mythodea at the Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens, Greece. In July 2003 {{she performed}} at the Ravinia Chicago Symphony Orchestra Gala with Bobby McFerrin and Denyce Graves. In 2006 she and James Ingram sang the song They Won't Go When <b>I</b> <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> a Tribute to Stevie Wonder and she began including Wonder's music in her recitals. In July 2007 she debuted at the Aspen Music Festival performing an all-Gershwin program {{as part of a}} season benefit. In October 2007, at a fundraiser for the Keep a Child Alive Charity, Kathleen Battle and Alicia Keys performed the song Miss Sarajevo written by U2's Bono.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E
500|$|While {{flying a}} Bristol Scout on 16 May 1916, Ball scored his first aerial victory, driving down a German {{reconnaissance}} aircraft. He then switched to Nieuports, bringing down two LVGs on 29 May and a Fokker Eindecker on 1 June. On 25 June {{he became a}} balloon buster and an ace by destroying an observation balloon with phosphor bombs. During the month he had written to his parents admonishing them to try and [...] "take it well" [...] if he was killed, [...] "for men tons better than <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> hundreds every day". He again achieved two victories in one sortie on 2 July, shooting down a Roland C.II and an Aviatik to bring his score to seven.|$|E

500|$|Lopez later {{confirmed}} {{in an interview}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest, that the completed music video would premiere jointly on season ten of American Idol and on Vevo on March 3,2011. Fans could vote between three alternative endings through Idols official website. Lopez said the idea behind giving fans the choice was {{to give them a}} chance to see what she experienced. [...] "You get to do what I do,... Like, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there with my videos and I start editing and picking all the shots I like and the things that I like and what I feel the best kind of feeling for the record is. You guys get to do that. We picked two different ones and we weren't sure." [...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants. The first ending was the one used in the final video.|$|E
500|$|Marceline is {{voiced by}} Olivia Olson. Olivia's father Martin Olson was an {{acquaintance}} of Ward, and Olivia was encouraged to audition for Adventure Time after Ward told her father that he wanted [...] "her as a voice" [...] on his show. She had originally auditioned {{for the role of}} Princess Bubblegum. After her initial audition, she was asked to read for the role of Marceline, and was [...] "definitely impressed by the character" [...] after seeing design drawings. Martin Olson later noted that Olivia's audition was a [...] "sham" [...] to please the network executives because Ward had already wanted her to be a voice on the show. In order to get into character, Olson often dresses {{in a manner similar to}} Marceline when she records her lines; she explained, [...] "I always find ... that on the days that <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> to record Marceline, I’ll dress like her, in a weird way ... I’ll throw on some rock n’ roll boots, maybe some red lipstick, and just go in there." [...] Olson also is the character's singing voice. According to storyboard artist Cole Sanchez, composers Casey James Basichis and Tim Kiefer produce the bass music that the character performs in the series. Many of the songs written for Marceline were uploaded onto the internet by the writers as well as the production company. For instance, Rob Sugar—the father of former storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar—often uploaded demos of songs written for Marceline by Rebecca. Furthermore, Frederator also posted demos, as well as a full version of the popular [...] "Fry Song", sung by Marceline in the episode [...] "It Came from the Nightosphere", on its official blog. In flashback sequences, younger Marceline is voiced by Ava Acres. In the fifth season episodes [...] "Finn the Human" [...] / [...] "Jake the Dog", an older, alternate universe version of the character is voiced by Cloris Leachman. Martin Olson also provides the voice for Marceline's demonic father Hunson Abadeer. Olivia Olson later noted that the opportunity to voice act with her father was [...] "pretty cool”.|$|E
2500|$|Many musicians {{have also}} remarked {{on the quality}} of the album and its {{influence}} on their own work. For example, Elton John said, in his notes for Wonder on the 2003 Rolling Stones list of [...] "The Immortals – The Greatest Artists of All Time" [...] (in which Wonder was ranked number 15): [...] "Let me put it this way: wherever <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the world, I always take a copy of Songs in the Key of Life. For me, it's the best album ever made, and I'm always left in awe after I listen to it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first known}} {{usage of the}} word in print {{appeared}} in the San Francisco Chronicle on April 21, 1988, Section D, Page 1. Chronicle writer Lowell Cohn wrote an article headlined [...] "What the Eck?" [...] about Oakland reliever Dennis Eckersley's unusual way of speaking: [...] "For a translation, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> search of Eckersley. I also {{want to know why}} he calls short home runs 'street pieces,' and home runs that come in the last at-bat of a game 'walkoff pieces' ..." [...] Although the term originally was coined with a negative connotation, in reference to the pitcher (who must [...] "walk off" [...] the field with his head hung in shame), it has come to acquire a more celebratory connotation, for the batter who circles the bases with pride and with the adulation of the home crowd.|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{previously}} {{stated that}} filming the baby swap storylines [...] "did not stretch her acting abilities". She told Buzz: [...] "None of it's been really tough for me, {{to tell you}} the truth. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> do my scenes and then I go home. As an actress you want to get roles you can get your teeth into. I leave it at the gates when I leave work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game. But I've been doing it a lot longer now, and can detach myself from it. You have to." [...] On a lighter note, Wallace added: [...] "There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets – that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always grabbing at the chicken fillets I have to wear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after leaving}} Warner Bros. Records, Tritt signed to Columbia Records and {{released}} the album Down the Road <b>I</b> <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> 2000. The album's first release was [...] "Best of Intentions," [...] his fifth and final number one hit on Billboard. It was also his most successful entry on the Hot 100, where it reached number 27. The next two singles, [...] "It's a Great Day to Be Alive" [...] and [...] "Love of a Woman," [...] both peaked at number {{two on the}} country charts in 2001, followed by [...] "Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde" [...] at number eight. All three songs also crossed over to the Hot 100, respectively reaching peaks of 33, 39 and 55. Tritt wrote or co-wrote seven of the album's songs, including [...] "Best of Intentions," [...] and collaborated with Charlie Daniels on two of them. [...] "It's a Great Day to Be Alive" [...] was originally recorded by Jon Randall, whose version {{was to have been}} included on an unreleased album for BNA Records in the late 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson {{works out}} [...] "about a third" [...] of the {{finished}} arrangement of a song as he's writing it, leaving the rest to studio experimentation. As he writes in 1990: [...] "Making an instrumental track is a whole experience. It starts after you have written a song. As I write a song, I write some of the instrumental piano and pluck some of the different notes for the arrangement. It's impossible to lay the whole arrangement on the piano but you play just {{enough to get the}} overall feelin’ of the record. It is an art in itself. I always get that bigger picture of my records at my piano before I record them. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there prepared." [...] From the very beginning, Wilson handled most stages of the group's recording process, despite Nik Venet being credited for producing their early recordings. He preferred mixing live as performances were recorded, as opposed to mixing after the fact. He was open to changes suggested by others while recording, often taking advice and even incorporating apparent mistakes if they provided a useful or interesting alternative. On Surfin' U.S.A. (1963), Brian began doubletracking. As was practiced by other record producers from the 1960s, most of his mixes ended up in single-channel monaural, believing that varied stereo speaker placement took his control over the sound image away to the listener.|$|E
2500|$|A {{press release}} also {{revealed}} {{she had worked}} with Salaam Remi, something which Love confirmed {{when he said he}} had worked on a song with Remi called [...] "Love Is the Greatest" [...] that he hoped would make the album. Of these recordings, only [...] "Motivation" [...] made the album appearing as song number three, while its Rebel Rock Remix appears on the deluxe edition as track thirteen. In another interview Rowland told the Daily Star that she had spoken to will.i.am about working on the album and was also keen to get Sean [...] "Diddy" [...] Combs on the album. Shondrae 'Bangladesh' Crawford who is best known for producing [...] "Diva" [...] and [...] "Video Phone" [...] by Rowland's ex-bandmate and close friend Beyoncé, revealed to Rap-Up that he had also been in the studio with Rowland. Of the collaborations, Bangladesh said, [...] "the music that we've done is just hard, it's edgy, but it's still sexy, and it's not raunchy ... What I like to do when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> with artists, I like to recreate and reinvent 'em, even if they didn't need that." [...] Another song recorded for the album was the Brian Kennedy-produced dance song [...] "On and On" [...] which was written by Kennedy, Merritt, Rowland and Robert Allen. [...] "On and On" [...] was used in episode fifteen of the MTV reality TV series The Hills. Both Bangladesh and Kennedy productions are omitted from the album.|$|E
