5|$|Besides {{expansion}} of the university, Georgetown also aimed to expand its resources and student body. The School of Nursing has admitted <b>female</b> <b>students</b> since its founding, {{and most of the}} university classes were made available to them on a limited basis by 1952. With the College of Arts and Sciences welcoming its first <b>female</b> <b>students</b> in the 1969–1970 academic year, Georgetown became fully coeducational.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, Cornell {{admitted}} {{its first}} <b>female</b> <b>students,</b> {{making it the}} first coeducational school among {{what came to be}} known as the Ivy League. However, the admission of <b>female</b> <b>students</b> was limited until the construction of Sage Hall to serve as a women's dormitory in 1872. The requirement that women (at least freshman women) must live in dormitories, which started in 1884, served to constrain female student admissions until 1972, when Cornell dropped its freshman dorm residency requirement. As a result, the academic admission standards for women in each college were typically higher than the corresponding standards for men. In general, women have been over-represented in certain schools and under-represented in others. For example, the NYS College of Home Economics and the Cornell School of Nursing historically drew a disproportionate number of women students, while the College of Engineering attracted fewer women.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1969, Stuyvesant did {{not accept}} <b>female</b> <b>students.</b> That year, 14 girls were {{admitted}} to Stuyvesant and 12 enrolled {{at the start of}} September, marking the school's first co-educational year. By 2002, female enrollment had grown to 42%.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to proximity and competitiveness, the rivalry {{was fueled by}} controversial incidents {{both on and off}} the field. Maryland supporters long held that Navy players used unnecessary roughness during play, a charge counter-accused by the Academy after the 1963 game. Some Midshipmen would travel to College Park to meet <b>female</b> <b>students,</b> which served to aggravate the ill feelings. Pranks and vandalism were commonplace on both campuses and exacerbated the already tense situation between Maryland and Navy.|$|E
5|$|Lindenwood {{purchased}} land {{adjacent to}} the main campus containing various residential properties to create two large student quarters in adjacent neighborhoods, known as the Linden Terraces and First Capitol Houses. The properties offer on-campus housing for married student couples and single-parent students, and are also available to male and <b>female</b> <b>students.</b> Linden Terrace neighborhood lies just southwest from the main campus. First Capitol Houses and the Powell Terrace Residential Area sit east of campus across First Capitol Drive from the main campus.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to raise}} {{sufficient}} funds locally, the seminary's founders borrowed money {{to construct a}} building in 1854. They were discouraged by the school's finances and sold it to Wood and Gregory, who borrowed money for the purchase. In 1857 Wood married Henry Shimer, a mason who was a creditor of the seminary. In 1864, the overcrowded school began accepting <b>female</b> <b>students</b> only.|$|E

5|$|Although many {{of these}} early schools were open for only a short time, efforts persisted. The Mohawk Institute Residential School, the oldest, {{continuously}} operated residential school in Canada, opened in 1834 on Six Nations of the Grand River near Brantford, Ontario. Administered by the Anglican Church, the facility opened as the Mechanics' Institute, a day school for boys, in 1828 and became a boarding school four years later when it accepted its first boarders and began admitting <b>female</b> <b>students.</b> It remained in operation until June 30, 1970.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} seven, Goldman {{moved with}} her family to the Prussian city of Königsberg (then part of the German Empire), and she {{enrolled}} in a Realschule. One teacher punished disobedient students—targeting Goldman in particular—by beating their hands with a ruler. Another teacher tried to molest his <b>female</b> <b>students</b> and was fired when Goldman fought back. She found a sympathetic mentor in her German-language teacher, who loaned her books and took her to an opera. A passionate student, Goldman passed the exam for admission into a gymnasium, but her religion teacher refused to provide a certificate of good behavior and {{she was unable to}} attend.|$|E

5|$|<b>Female</b> <b>students</b> were {{admitted}} to the college {{for the first time}} in 1987; until then it had been single sex. Since this time the college has become fully mixed, with undergraduate numbers expanding to nearly seven hundred. Expansion caused a strain on college numbers, however, and in 2004 the college was unable to provide accommodation for all of its fresher students {{for the first time in}} its history. Following the foundation of Josephine Butler, Durham's first new college to be opened since 1972, pressure from the university to take on additional students has lessened, and undergraduate numbers have been intentionally reduced in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{entered a}} {{classroom}} {{on the second}} floor, room 206, where teacher Sandra Smith taught Honors English. When Smith {{asked him what he}} was doing in the classroom, he pulled out his handgun and ordered her, all of the male students, and several <b>female</b> <b>students</b> to leave. He then fired one shot into the air after Smith tried to speak to him again. After Smith and the male students left the classroom, Morrison instructed the seven remaining students to stand facing the chalkboard. He later released one student at approximately 12:15 p.m., before law enforcement arrived at the scene.|$|E
5|$|Over 15,000 {{students}} attend classes on the UND campus each year. About 40 {{percent of the}} student body is from North Dakota and the other half is made up of students from all 50 states and over 60 other nations. The ratio between male and <b>female</b> <b>students</b> is about even. Demographically, about 80 percent {{of the student body}} is caucasian. Students can live on or off campus. On campus, there are 14 residence halls and 850 student apartment units, as well as thirteen fraternities and seven sororities. There are over 275 student organizations at UND as well as an intramural sports program called RecSports.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} transcendental phenomenological {{study was to explore}} and describe the lived experiences of <b>female</b> <b>student</b> veterans with disabilities entering higher education during reintegration in order to improve programs, services, and support available to <b>female</b> <b>student</b> veterans with disabilities. A screening questionnaire, interviews, a focus group, and journals were used to collect data. Participants consisted of 11 <b>female</b> <b>student</b> veterans with disabilities who were purposively selected using criterion, snowball, and maximum variation sampling. The central research question was: What are the transition experiences of <b>female</b> <b>student</b> veterans with disabilities entering college during reintegration into society? Four sub-questions were also addressed. Data analyses were conducted using Moustakas’ (1994) recommendations of a transcendental phenomenological study, and five themes were identified. Textural and structural descriptions were written and integrated into the composite description to reveal the essence of participants’ experiences. Findings served to inform post-secondary institutions of the diverse needs of <b>female</b> <b>student</b> veterans with disabilities so they can better serve them, increase student veterans’ perseverance and academic success, and provide a smoother reintegration for all student veterans with disabilities...|$|R

5|$|The Platte Canyon High School {{hostage crisis}} was a hostage taking and {{shooting}} at Platte Canyon High School in Bailey, Colorado, on September 27, 2006. The gunman, 53-year-old Duane Roger Morrison, took six <b>female</b> <b>students</b> hostage and sexually assaulted them, later releasing four. When police broke open the classroom's door with explosives, Morrison opened {{fire with a}} semi-automatic pistol before shooting hostage Emily Keyes in the head. The other remaining hostages escaped unharmed, and paramedics confirmed that Morrison had committed suicide shortly before police were able to enter the classroom. Keyes was pronounced dead at 4:32 p.m. MDT (23:32 UTC) at Saint Anthony's Hospital in Denver, Colorado after undergoing emergency surgery.|$|E
5|$|The ao dai {{is now a}} {{standard}} for weddings, for celebrating Tết and for other formal occasions. It's the required uniform for female teachers (mostly {{from high school to}} below) and <b>female</b> <b>students</b> in common high schools in the South; there is no requirement for color or pattern for teachers while students use plain white with some small patterns like flowers for school uniform. Companies often require their female staff to wear uniforms that include the ao dai, so flight attendants, receptionists, bank female staff, restaurant staff, and hotel workers in Vietnam may be seen wearing it.|$|E
