5|$|The {{arrangement}} of <b>genitalia</b> {{is important in}} courtship and mating as they prevent cross-specific mating and hybridisation. The uniqueness of a species' <b>genitalia</b> led {{to the use of}} the morphological study of <b>genitalia</b> as one of the most important keys in taxonomic identification of taxa below family level. With the advent of DNA analysis, the study of <b>genitalia</b> has now become just one of the techniques used in taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>genitalia</b> {{are complex}} and {{provide the basis for}} species {{discrimination}} in most families and also in family identification. The <b>genitalia</b> arise from the tenth or most distal segment of the abdomen. Lepidoptera have some of the most complex genital structures of all insects, {{with a wide variety of}} complex spines, setae, scales and tufts in males, claspers of different shapes and different modifications of the ductus bursae in females, through which stored sperm is transferred within the female directly, or indirectly, to the vagina for fertilisation.|$|E
5|$|Book I The {{grouping}} {{of animals and}} {{the parts of the}} human body. Aristotle describes the parts that the human body is made of, such as the skull, brain, face, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, thorax, belly, heart, viscera, <b>genitalia,</b> and limbs.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches have {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, {{meaning that}} the nymphs are generally similar to the adults, except for undeveloped wings and <b>genitalia.</b> Development is generally slow, and may take {{a few months to}} over a year. The adults are also long-lived, and have survived for as much as four years in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches use pheromones {{to attract}} mates, and the males {{practice}} courtship rituals, such as posturing and stridulation. Like many insects, cockroaches mate {{facing away from}} each other with their <b>genitalia</b> in contact, and copulation can be prolonged. A few species are known to be parthenogenetic, reproducing without the need for males.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{produced}} by cancer within the pelvis {{varies depending on}} the affected tissue. It may appear {{at the site of}} the cancer but it frequently radiates diffusely to the upper thigh, and may refer to the lower back, the external <b>genitalia</b> or perineum.|$|E
5|$|Phallic {{architecture}} became {{prominent in}} ancient Egypt and Greece, where <b>genitalia</b> and human sexuality received {{a high degree}} of attention. The ancient Greeks honored the phallus and celebrated phallic festivals. The Greco-Roman deity Priapus was worshiped as a god of fertility, depicted with a giant phallus in numerous public architectural pieces.|$|E
5|$|Scales also {{cover the}} head, {{parts of the}} thorax and abdomen as well as parts of the <b>genitalia.</b> The {{morphology}} of scales has been studied by Downey & Allyn (1975) and scales have been classified into three groups, namely hair-like, or piliform, blade-like, or lamellar and other variable forms.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen or body is {{composed}} of nine segments. In the larva it ranges from segments 5 to 13. The eleventh segment of the larva holds a pair of anal claspers, which protude in some taxa and represent the <b>genitalia.</b>|$|E
5|$|These {{include two}} images {{that show the}} subject standing. One captures a full length view, in which the subject is unclothed except {{for a pair of}} {{stockings}} and shoes. In the other, the subject's right leg is raised to provide a clearer view of the <b>genitalia.</b> Another image presents the subject lying back with one arm covering the face while someone else's hand pulls on the penile tissue. A similar photograph shows the subject in an examination position, with a hand– visible in the uncut photographic plate as belonging to Maisonneuve– spreading the vaginal lips. The series also includes a close-up of the subject's <b>genitalia,</b> with the legs open.|$|E
5|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM), {{also known as}} female genital cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of {{some or all of}} the external female <b>genitalia.</b> The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.|$|E
5|$|Other {{suggestions}} {{for the cover}} included the group urinating against a Marshall Stack and an overweight nude woman with the Who's faces in place of her <b>genitalia.</b> An alternative cover featuring Moon dressed in black lingerie and a brown wig, holding a whip, was later used for the inside art for the 1995 and 2003 CD releases. Some of the photographs taken during these sessions were later used as part of Decca's United States promotion of the album.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History gave {{a species}} of praying mantis the name Ilomantis ginsburgae after Ginsburg. The name was given because the neck plate of the Ilomantis ginsburgae bears a {{resemblance}} to a jabot, which Ginsburg is known for wearing. Moreover, the new species was identified based upon the female insect's <b>genitalia</b> instead of based upon the male of the species. The researchers noted that the name was a nod to Ginsburg's fight for gender equality.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are also}} found in hairless areas (glabrous skin) of the eyelids, nose, penis, labia minora, the inner mucosal {{membrane}} of the cheek, and nipples. Some sebaceous glands have unique names. Sebaceous glands on the lip and mucosa of the cheek, and on the <b>genitalia,</b> are known as Fordyce spots, and glands on the eyelids are known as meibomian glands. Sebaceous glands of the breast are also known as Montgomery's glands.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen has ten segments, {{each with}} a pair of spiracles for respiration. Segment ten bears a pair of cerci, a pair of anal styles, the anus and the {{external}} <b>genitalia.</b> Males have an aedeagus through which they secrete sperm during copulation and females have spermathecae for storing sperm and an ovipositor through which the ootheca is laid.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{stage is}} usually short, its {{function}} only to mate and lay eggs. The <b>genitalia</b> of female flies are rotated to a varying {{degree from the}} position found in other insects. In some flies, this is a temporary rotation during mating, but in others, it is a permanent torsion of the organs that occurs during the pupal stage. This torsion {{may lead to the}} anus being below the genitals, or, in the case of 360° torsion, to the sperm duct being wrapped around the gut and the external organs being in their usual position. When flies mate, the male initially flies on top of the female, facing in the same direction, but then turns around to face in the opposite direction. This forces the male to lie on his back for his <b>genitalia</b> to remain engaged with those of the female, or the torsion of the male genitals allows the male to mate while remaining upright. This leads to flies having more reproduction abilities than most insects, and much quicker. Flies occur in large populations due to their ability to mate effectively and quickly during the mating season.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} {{most commonly}} adopted is that proposed by Beier in 1968. He divided the order into eight families. Klass, in 1997, studied the external male <b>genitalia</b> and postulated that the families Chaeteessidae and Metallyticidae diverged {{from the other}} families at an early date. However, the Mantidae and Thespidae are both polyphyletic, so the Mantodea {{will have to be}} revised.|$|E
5|$|The floury {{baker is}} {{distinguished}} {{from a similar}} undescribed species A. sp. nr curvicosta (the little floury baker) by {{the structure of the}} male <b>genitalia</b> and an audibly distinct call. Members of Aleeta and Tryella are easily distinguished from other Australian cicadas as they lack tymbal covers, while the costal margin of their forewings gets larger toward the point where the wing is attached to the body. In these genera it is clearly wider than the costal vein.|$|E
5|$|The <b>genitalia</b> of {{the female}} closely resembles that of the male; the {{clitoris}} is shaped and positioned like a penis, and is capable of erection. The female also possesses no external vagina (vaginal opening), as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. The pseudo-penis is traversed to its tip by a central urogenital canal, through which the female urinates, copulates and gives birth. The pseudo-penis can be distinguished from the males' <b>genitalia</b> by its greater thickness and more rounded glans. In both males and females, {{the base of the}} glans is covered with penile spines. The formation of the pseudo-penis appears largely androgen independent, as the pseudo-penis appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. After parturition, the pseudo-penis is stretched, and loses many of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve is {{the main}} nerve of the perineum. It carries {{sensation}} from the external <b>genitalia</b> of both sexes and the skin around the anus and perineum, as well the motor supply to various pelvic muscles, including the male or female external urethral sphincter and the external anal sphincter. If damaged, most commonly by childbirth, lesions may cause sensory loss or fecal incontinence. The nerve may be temporarily blocked {{as part of an}} anaesthetic procedure.|$|E
5|$|There are {{intentional}} and unintentional modifications {{concerning the}} clitoris, including female genital mutilation (FGM), sex reassignment surgery, clitoris enlargement and genital piercings. For example, use of anabolic steroids by bodybuilders and other athletes {{can result in}} significant enlargement of the clitoris in concert with other masculinizing effects on their bodies. Abnormal enlargement of the clitoris may also {{be referred to as}} clitoromegaly, but clitoromegaly is more commonly seen as a congenital anomaly of the <b>genitalia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tree {{species of}} hawkmoth have been {{recorded}} to emit ultrasound clicks by rubbing their genitalia; males produce by rubbing rigid scales on {{the exterior of the}} claspers while females produce sound by contracting their <b>genitalia</b> which causes rubbing of scales against the abdomen. The function of this noise-making is not clear and suggestions put forward include the jamming of bat echo-location, and, advertising that the bat's prey are prickly and excellent fliers.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the <b>genitalia,</b> though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E
5|$|An {{unabridged}} {{edition of}} Anne Frank's work {{was published in}} 1995. This version included Anne's description of her exploration of her own <b>genitalia</b> and her puzzlement regarding sex and childbirth, a passage {{that had previously been}} edited out by Otto Frank. When Gail Horalek of Northville, Michigan, learned in March 2013 that her daughter's seventh-grade class was using this edition of the diary in class, she {{filed a complaint with the}} school district asking that an edited version be used instead. Horalek, who described the passage as pornographic, said the school should have obtained prior approval from parents before assigning the book. In 2010, school officials in Culpeper County, Virginia, stopped assigning the unabridged version after similar complaints were lodged.|$|E
5|$|Crickets are hemimetabolic insects, whose {{lifecycle}} {{consists of}} an egg stage, a larval or nymph stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and an adult stage. The egg hatches into a nymph {{about the size of}} a fruit fly. This passes through about 10 larval stages, and with each successive moult, it becomes more like an adult. After the final moult, the <b>genitalia</b> and wings are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.|$|E
5|$|During sexual arousal, the {{clitoris}} and {{the whole}} of the <b>genitalia</b> engorge and change color as the erectile tissues fill with blood (vasocongestion), and the individual experiences vaginal contractions. The ischiocavernosus and bulbocavernosus muscles, which insert into the corpora cavernosa, contract and compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris (the only vein that drains the blood from the spaces in the corpora cavernosa) and the arterial blood continues a steady flow and, having no way to drain out, fills the venous spaces until they become turgid and engorged with blood. This is what leads to clitoral erection.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred to the external <b>genitalia</b> of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct over a period of a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E
5|$|Five males {{collected}} from an M. vindex nest are {{presumed to be}} M. inquilina, but {{the similarities between the}} two species cannot confirm if the males are M. inquilina. While the males collected are morphologically similar to M. vindex males, the head and gaster are darker, and two specimens show a reddish-brown colour {{at the base of the}} first gastric segment, a characteristic that does not occur in M. vindex males. The <b>genitalia</b> is similar, but a more detailed study can distinguish these features among the two ants.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly Janet Woollard {{called for}} the statue's <b>genitalia</b> to be covered up, but nothing was done. In November 2005 Richard Wilkes again {{called for the}} statue's groin to be covered, {{on the grounds that}} such a {{depiction}} would be more historically accurate, as Yagan would have worn a covering for most of the year. Also under consideration is {{the creation of a new}} statue with a head shape that accords better with the forensic reconstruction of Yagan's head.|$|E
5|$|Motivations for {{clitoral}} modification and mutilation vary. Those taking hormones {{or other}} medications {{as part of}} female-to-male transition usually experience dramatic clitoral growth; individual desires and the difficulties of phalloplasty (construction of a penis) often result in the retention of the original <b>genitalia</b> with the enlarged clitoris as a penis analogue (metoidioplasty). However, the clitoris cannot reach {{the size of the}} penis through hormones. A surgery to add function to the clitoris, such as metoidioplasty, is an alternative to phalloplasty that permits retention of sexual sensation in the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{body has}} a {{hardened}} exoskeleton, {{except for the}} abdomen which is less sclerotised. The head is shaped like a capsule with appendages arising from it. Adult mouthparts include a prominent proboscis formed from maxillary galeae, and are adapted for sucking nectar. Some species do not feed as adults, and may have reduced mouthparts, while others have them modified for piercing and suck blood or fruit juices. Mandibles are absent in all except the Micropterigidae which have chewing mouthparts. Adult Lepidoptera have two immobile, multi-faceted compound eyes, and only two simple eyes or ocelli, which may be reduced. The three segments of the thorax are fused together. Antennae are prominent and besides the faculty of smell, act as olfactory radar, and also aid navigation, orientation and balance during flight. In moths, males frequently have more feathery antennae than females, for detecting the female pheromones at a distance. There are two pairs of membranous wings which arise from the mesothoracic (middle) and metathoracic (third) segments; they are usually completely covered by minute scales. The two wings on each side act as one by virtue of wing-locking mechanisms. In some groups, the females are flightless and have reduced wings. The abdomen has ten segments connected with movable inter-segmental membranes. The last segments of the abdomen form the external <b>genitalia.</b> The <b>genitalia</b> are complex and {{provide the basis for}} family identification and species discrimination.|$|E
5|$|The {{adults of}} some Australian cicada {{are subject to}} a cicada-specific fungus from the genus Massospora, which grows on their <b>genitalia</b> and {{abdominal}} cavity, eventually causing the tail end to drop off. Australian cicadas are further preyed on by the cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees. Their victims drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100m (330ft). They are then shoved into the hunter's burrow, where the helpless cicada is placed on a shelf in an often extensive 'catacomb', to form food-stock for the wasp grub growing from the eggs deposited within.|$|E
5|$|The final moult of the nymph {{is not to}} {{the full}} adult form, but to a winged stage called a subimago that {{physically}} resembles the adult, but which is usually sexually immature and duller in colour. The subimago often has partially cloudy wings fringed with minute hairs; its eyes, legs and <b>genitalia</b> are not fully developed. Subimagos are generally poor fliers, and typically lack the colour patterns used to attract mates. After a period, usually lasting {{one or two days}} but in some species only a few minutes, the subimago moults to the full adult form, making mayflies the only insects where a winged form undergoes a further moult.|$|E
5|$|The floury baker's {{distinctive}} {{appearance and}} loud call make it popular with children. Both the common and genus name {{are derived from}} the white, flour-like filaments covering the adult body. Its body and eyes are generally brown with pale patterns including a light-coloured line along the midline of the pronotum. Its forewings have distinctive dark brown patches {{at the base of}} two of their apical cells. The female is larger than the male, although species size overall varies geographically, with larger animals associated with regions of higher rainfall. The male has distinctive <b>genitalia</b> and a loud and complex call generated by the frequent buckling of ribbed tymbals and amplified by abdominal air sacs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>genitalia</b> of {{the male}} and female in any {{particular}} species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (male) and key (female). In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'viniculum'. They form a ring-like structure for the attachment of genital parts and a pair of lateral clasping organs (claspers or 'harpe'). The male has a median tubular organ (called the aedeagus) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused in advanced forms.|$|E
5|$|While {{the layout}} of {{internal}} genital ducts and openings of the female <b>genitalia</b> depends upon the taxonomic group that insect belongs to, the internal female reproductive system of all lepidopterans consists of paired ovaries and accessory glands which produce the yolks and shells of the eggs. Female insects have a system of receptacles and ducts in which sperm is received, transported and stored. The oviducts of the female join {{together to form a}} common duct (called the 'oviductus communis') which leads to the vagina.|$|E
