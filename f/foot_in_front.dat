25|$|Edward arrayed {{his army}} in a {{defensive}} posture among the hedges and orchards of the area, {{in front of}} the forest of Nouallie. He deployed his front line of longbowmen behind a particularly prominent thick hedge, through which the road ran at right angles. The Earl of Douglas, commanding the Scottish division in the French army, advised King John that the attack should be delivered on foot, with horses being particularly vulnerable to English arrows. John heeded this advice, leaving its baggage behind and forming up on <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the English.|$|E

500|$|Rix {{shuttled}} {{back and}} forth between her two ailing family members until, on 2 September 1914, Elsie died. For three months Rix withheld the news from her mother, fearing it would harm her already fragile condition. Elizabeth survived the news, but as the war continued, Rix's artistic output dwindled almost to nothing. Then in March 1916, Elizabeth died. Rix was just over thirty years old, and all her immediate relatives were now dead. Recalling the experience, she later wrote: [...] "I could scarcely put one <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other and walked like an old thing".|$|E
500|$|Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail has criticised Amy for {{the amount}} of make-up she wears. When Leyla accused her of thieving, Stephen said it couldn't have been her because she wears too much eye make-up. She jibed [...] "she's lucky she can find one <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other." [...] When Amy is unsure whether or not to abort her baby, Stephen jested her first {{decision}} should be whether to change her mascara - [...] "I’ve seen less fuel-faced coal miners." [...] Stephen opined that it was obvious David was heading for trouble with [...] "gratingly Geordie Amy." [...] She said she had no sympathy for him because he knowingly walked into Amy's [...] "maelstrom of rampant teen hormones." [...] Entertainment website Digital Spy have chosen certain plots featuring Amy in their [...] "Picture of the day" [...] recommendation feature. These include Amy being accused of thieving, blackmailing David and revealing her pregnancy to Cain.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and {{lying on the floor}} of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings [...] "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing [...] "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put one <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the one thing about those lyrics is you can hear me finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up for myself and say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E

60|$|It {{was still}} freezing, and, though the stars shone, the trees grew so closely {{about the house}} {{that it was too}} dark for me to see more than a few <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of me.|$|R
6000|$|Dominey and Rosamund {{returned}} {{about one}} o'clock {{to find a}} note from Seaman, which the former tore open as his companion stood warming her <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the fire. There {{were only a few}} lines: ...|$|R
2500|$|In late 1949, Bradbury {{was stopped}} and {{questioned}} {{by a police}} officer while walking late one night. When asked [...] "What are you doing?", Bradbury wisecracked, [...] "Putting one <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of another." [...] This incident inspired Bradbury to write the 1951 short story [...] "The Pedestrian".|$|E
2500|$|Gibney Beach {{is located}} on North Shore Road (Route 20) about [...] from Mongoose Junction in {{downtown}} Cruz Bay. There are no signs that lead you to Gibney, no parking lot and no facilities. There {{is only a small}} gravel road leading down to the beach, blocked off by a tall white gate to keep cars out. There is a small opening in the gate allowing entrance by <b>foot.</b> <b>In</b> <b>front</b> of the gate, {{a small portion of the}} road is open where about four cars will tightly fit. Even though it is open to the public, the beach has a very private feel.|$|E
2500|$|The best-known {{types of}} Archaic {{sculpture}} are the kouros and kore, near life-size frontal statues {{of a young}} man or woman, which were developed around the middle of the seventh century BC in the Cyclades. [...] Probably the earliest kore produced was the Dedication of Nikandre, which was dedicated to Artemis at her temple on Delos between 660 and 650 BC, while kouroi began to be created shortly after this. [...] Kouroi and korai were used to represent both humans and divinities. [...] Some kouroi, such as the Colossus of the Naxians from around 600 BC, are known to represent Apollo, while the Phrasikleia Kore was meant to represent a young woman whose tomb it originally marked. Early in the seventh century around 650 BC when kore are widely introduced, Daedalic style made an appearance in Greek sculpture. This style consisted most noticeably of a geometric pattern of female subjects' hair framing their face. On male sculptures they were often posed with one <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> as if in motion.|$|E
60|$|Fulkerson squared his <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of {{the bust}} and {{compared}} it by fleeting glances {{with the old}} man as he got stiffly up and suffered Beaton to help him on with his thin, shabby overcoat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I got {{a pretty}} bad scare when I came down the {{mountain}} side," [...] said Granbury Lapham, when they stopped to rest. [...] "A bear came along not more than fifty <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of me." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{training}} round / practice rocket {{was available}} for Blindicide. This used a blank 20 mm cartridge to produce a flash and a bang, but the round only fell a few <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the launcher.|$|R
2500|$|Young used session musicians for his 1960s' covers album, The Singer {{released}} in August 1981 {{but failed to}} reached the top 50. Young turned to a more contemporary electropop sound and adult oriented style. He signed to the Australian branch of German label I.C. Records in 1983 and flew to Germany with producer, composer and keyboard player John Capek (ex-Carson) to start recording a new album, with sessions at studios in Hanover, Munich, Los Angeles, Melbourne and Sydney. Most of the material was co-written by Capek and Canadian Marc Jordan. The resulting album, One <b>Foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>Front</b> was {{released in}} March 1984. The lead single, [...] "Soldier of Fortune", peaked at No.17 on the national singles chart, other singles [...] "War Games", [...] "L.A. Sunset" [...] and [...] "Call the Night" [...] (1984) all failed to chart into the top 50, [...] "Soldier of Fortune" [...] gained further prominence when it was picked as the theme song for the 1984 Summer Paralympics held in New York City, and also went on to be a hit in Germany.|$|E
2500|$|... "Beautiful Tonight" [...] was {{confirmed}} as the follow-up single {{on the third}} week of January through the Daily Star. The release date is yet to be announced. They stated, [...] "You can imagine our next single Beautiful Tonight being played in a club. Yes, it’s that different to what we usually release. John Shanks wrote it and it’s up-tempo and will open a few eyes and ears. People who don’t usually like Westlife might like it and hopefully people who do like us won’t not like it. It’s young, fresh and exciting so we feel brilliant about it coming out. When they first hear it, some people might go: [...] "Whoa, who is that?” and that’s why we wanted it as our first song on the album. It’d be cool to get a couple of good dance remixes off it but we won’t be coming up with a dance routine for it on tour, except for maybe a few clicks and putting one <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other. The song reminds us of the early days when we put out [...] "World of Our Own". The song was performed live on Irish national television show Paul O'Grady Show. After that, the track peaked at the top 40 of Irish Radio Airplay Chart.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you want?" [...] Mr Harvey said, {{advancing}} on <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the waggons, {{while the}} lads {{and the three}} hunters stood, rifles in hand, behind them.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2015 it {{was decided}} to fit all the cycles with front lasers. The laser {{projects}} a green cycle symbol approximately 15 <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the bike to warn drivers and effectively reduce blind angles.|$|R
50|$|Much thought {{went into}} {{building}} this gate. A few <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> {{of the gate}} is a large wall. This prevented elephants and soldiers (during enemy attacks) from having a proper ramp to run and break the gate.|$|R
30|$|Intervention – All {{participants}} {{stood in}} the center of the test room, 5 <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the large display. With a clicker, they were able to advance to sections at their own pace. They were seated after the intervention.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{much further}} to that shelter?" [...] queried Fred. Just {{then he took}} no {{interest}} whatever in game. He was so tired he could scarcely place one <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other; and, to tell the truth, his cousins were little better off.|$|E
6000|$|Thought is quick. Burglary flashed into my mind! A villainous-looking fellow {{leaped out}} as the door flew open. I {{recognised}} him instantly {{as the man who}} had sold Dumps to me. I put my <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of him. He went over it with a wild pitch, and descended the steps on his nose! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{infantry}} {{were composed}} of men of good but less exalted families. They wore a red tunic without a belt. They carried a great circular buckler {{of more than}} a yard in diameter, formed of the tough hide of the river horse, brought down from the upper Nile, with a central boss of metal with a point projecting nearly a <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the shield, enabling it to be used as an offensive weapon in a close fight. They carried short heavy swords {{similar to those of the}} Romans, and went barefooted. Their total strength seldom exceeded two thousand.|$|E
50|$|He {{was painted}} c.1872 by J. M. Barclay wearing full Highland regalia, {{with a small}} terrier by his <b>feet,</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Blair Drummond. A studio {{photograph}} of the same date exists {{and seems to be}} the basis of the painting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{continued}} Yarner, [...] "we {{were sitting}} in our tent one hot night--too hot to sleep--when all at once we heard, not ten <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of us, the most terrific roar that ever came from the throat of a lion." ...|$|R
50|$|Speed {{signs were}} used to {{schedule}} vehicles to the green phase of the traffic signal ahead, which can be explained to funnel to driving speeds into the signals green time. For better performance, speed sings should be placed 600 to 1000 <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the intersection.|$|R
60|$|With dawn Agamemnon awoke, {{and fear}} {{had gone out}} of his heart. He put on his armour, and arrayed the chiefs on <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of their chariots, and behind them came the spearmen, with the bowmen and slingers on the wings of the army. Then a great black cloud spread over the sky, and red was the rain that fell from it. The Trojans {{gathered}} on a height in the plain, and Hector, shining in armour, went here and there, in front and rear, like a star that now gleams forth and now is hidden in a cloud.|$|E
6000|$|Don Pepe {{received}} {{the letter from}} his other hand, slapped his left side and his hips in succession, feeling for his spectacle case. After settling the heavy silvermounted affair astride his nose, and adjusting it carefully behind his ears, he opened the envelope, holding it up at about a <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of his eyes. The paper he pulled out contained some three lines of writing. He looked at {{them for a long}} time. His grey moustache moved slightly up and down, and the wrinkles, radiating {{at the corners of his}} eyes, ran together. He nodded serenely. [...] "Bueno," [...] he said. [...] "There is no answer." ...|$|E
60|$|And he nailed that shingle to a lath, {{and stood}} the lath up {{four or five}} <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He {{said it was a}} sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and {{trembling}} all over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he wouldn't wait for him to howl. Why, he didn't only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.|$|E
60|$|Mooween's {{eyes are}} his weak point. They are close together, {{and seem to}} focus on the ground a few <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of his nose. At twenty yards to leeward he can never tell you from a stump or a caribou, should you chance to be {{standing}} still.|$|R
60|$|And {{with that}} I rose, believing that I {{had given them}} all mortal offence. To my astonishment several got to their <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of me, huzzaing, and Comyn and Lord Ossory grasped my hands. And Charles Fox reached out over {{the corner of the}} table and pulled me back into my chair.|$|R
5000|$|The Burmese position, named {{so because}} of its use in Buddhist sculptures in Burma, places both <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the pelvis with knees bent and {{touching}} the floor to the sides. The heels are pointing toward pelvis or upward, and toes are pointed so that {{the tops of the}} feet lie on the ground. This looks similar to the cross legged position, but the feet are not placed underneath the thigh of the next leg, therefore the legs do not cross. Instead, one <b>foot</b> is placed <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other.|$|R
