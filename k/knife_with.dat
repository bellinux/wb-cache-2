5|$|As {{several other}} supernatural {{entities}} were also {{held responsible for}} bringing hail and torrential rains, when the entity is not explicitly named, it is often impossible to conclude to which the magical measures apply. There was, for example, a custom used when the approach of a thunderstorm was perceived: to bring a {{table in front of}} the house, and to put bread, salt, a <b>knife</b> <b>with</b> a black sheath, and an axe with its edge directed skywards on the table. By another custom, a fireplace trivet with its legs directed skywards, knives, forks, and the stub of the Slava candle were put on the table.|$|E
5|$|In preparation, Beauchamp {{packed a}} change of clothes, a black mask, and a <b>knife</b> <b>with</b> poison on the tip, {{to be used as}} the murder weapon. Finding all the inns filled when he arrived at Frankfort, he took lodging at the {{residence}} of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Between nine and ten o'clock that evening, Beauchamp went to Sharp's home. Dressed in disguise, he carried his usual clothes and buried them along the bank of the Kentucky River for retrieval following the murder. Discovering that Sharp was not home, Beauchamp looked for him in the city, finding him at a local tavern. He returned to Sharp's house to wait for him, and saw him return at midnight.|$|E
5|$|Richard Ferguson QC, for the defence, {{argued that}} the ESDA test, which {{suggested}} that the disputed words had {{been added to the}} notes later, was not reliable. The defence also produced 14 witness statements from the two Blakelock inquiries, seven of them excerpts from Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry and seven from the original investigation in 1985, the latter read out to the jury as statements H to N. One of the 1985 statements said that Silcott had been carrying a <b>knife</b> <b>with</b> a two-foot-long blade {{on the night of the}} murder, and that he had attacked Blakelock.|$|E

5|$|The CQC-6 (Close Quarters Combat— Six) or Viper Six is a {{handmade}} tactical folding <b>knife</b> <b>with</b> a tantō blade {{manufactured by}} knifemaker Ernest Emerson. Although initially reported as the sixth design in an evolution of fighting knives {{and the first}} model in the lineup of Emerson's Specwar Custom Knives, Emerson later revealed that the knife was named for SEAL Team Six. It has a chisel-ground blade of ATS-34 or 154CM stainless steel and a handle made of titanium and linen micarta. The CQC-6 is credited as the knife that popularized {{the concept of the}} tactical folding knife.|$|E
5|$|Calcium metal melts at 842°C and boils at 1494°C, {{higher than}} its {{adjacent}} group 2 metals do. It crystallises in the face-centered cubic arrangement like strontium; above 450°C, it changes to an anisotropic hexagonal close-packed arrangement like magnesium. The density of 1.55g·cm−3 {{is the lowest}} in its group, with others decreasing towards it. Calcium can be cut with a <b>knife</b> <b>with</b> effort, although it is still harder than lead. While calcium is a poorer conductor of electricity than copper or aluminium by volume, it is a better conductor than both of them by mass due to its very low density. Although it is infeasible for terrestrial applications as it reacts quickly with atmospheric oxygen, its use as a conductor in space has been considered.|$|E
5|$|Katherine {{continues}} to pursue Mike, believing {{that he is}} {{still in love with}} her. Mike warns her to leave his family alone and claims he never truly loved her. After he leaves, Katherine calls 9-1-1 asking for an ambulance, and then stabs herself with a <b>knife</b> <b>with</b> Mike's fingerprints on it. Katherine frames Mike for her wound. Susan, realizing that Katherine has suffered a total nervous breakdown, calls Katherine's daughter, Dylan (Lyndsy Fonseca), who comes to town and has her mother committed for psychiatric observation. Susan later forgives Katherine once she recovers from her breakdown. Soon after, Mike reveals that he has accumulated an immense debt in the past year. Unable to balance their debt, Susan and Mike decide to move off Wisteria Lane and rent their house out temporarily. They move into an apartment across town while Paul Young rents their house on Wisteria Lane.|$|E

50|$|The {{edge of a}} knife {{gradually}} {{loses its}} sharpness, which can be restored by sharpening. For many types of knives (e.g., butter knives) this is not relevant. <b>Knives</b> <b>with</b> smooth edges can be sharpened by the user; <b>knives</b> <b>with</b> any form of serrated edge should ideally be sharpened with specialist equipment, although the useful life of a serrated knife can be extended by simple sharpeners, even if they damage the edge.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{concerns}} about potential violence at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China began restricting [...] "dangerous knives", requiring that purchasers {{register with the}} government when purchasing these knives. Included in the new restrictions are <b>knives</b> <b>with</b> [...] "blood grooves", lockblade <b>knives,</b> <b>knives</b> <b>with</b> blades measuring over 22 cm (8.6 in) in length, and <b>knives</b> <b>with</b> blades over 15 cm in length also having a point angle of less than 60 degrees. As of January 2011, according to an authorized Leatherman dealer in Beijing all <b>knives</b> <b>with</b> a locking blade are illegal unless {{they are part of}} a larger multi-tool like a leatherman. However, many people still carry locking pocket knives especially when camping with no issues. He suggested carrying locking knives in checked luggage on airplanes, and on your person in trains and subways since they could be confiscated if found in a bag. Foreigners are generally given a bit more leeway in China so if a traveler is caught <b>with</b> a small <b>knife</b> there will probably be no prosecution and at most confiscation.|$|R

25|$|Another {{prominent}} {{feature on}} many folding knives is the opening mechanism. Traditional pocket knives and Swiss Army knives commonly employ the nail nick, while modern folding knives more often use a stud, hole, disk, or flipper {{located on the}} blade, all which {{have the benefit of}} allowing the user to open the <b>knife</b> <b>with</b> one hand.|$|E
