Food borne illnesses associated with consumption of <b>Fruit</b> and sugarcane <b>juices</b> at several places in India and elsewhere. <b>Fruit</b> <b>juices</b> were served with added ice pieces. Hygienic standards are not maintained while transporting {{from the field}} {{to the place of}} extraction and preparation. Hence a rapid review of the <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> from street vendors has been undertaken along with sugarcane juice. Raw sugarcane juice is a refreshing juice in many parts of Andhra Pradesh. The present study is to assess the prevalence of different organisms from different <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> collected from street vendors. METHODS <b>Fruit</b> <b>juices</b> are collected namely sugarcane, sweet lemon, orange, grape apple, pineapple pomegranate. A total 100 samples of <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> were collected from road side from different vendors. 150 ml of each variety of <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> were collected from different vendors in screw capped bottles and subjected to microbial analysis, processed with in 30 mts in the department of microbiology at KIMS by standard methods.

The natural co-oxidation reactions result in unwanted changes in aroma and color, which increases due to a higher concentration of polyphenols and polymerization of phenols and polyphenols in the <b>fruit</b> <b>juices.</b> The treatment of laccase decreases the phenolic content of juices and enhances the color stability of apple juice (Ribeiro et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Background: High {{intake of}} <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> and soft drinks {{contributes}} to excessive weight gain and obesity in children. Furthermore, parenting practices {{play an important}} role in the development of children’s dietary habits.

Objectives: To study the associations: (1) of both <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> and soft drinks consumption with water consumption of children and (2) The associations between parenting practices towards <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> and soft drinks and water consumption of children. Design: Cross-sectional data from 6 to 8 year old children from seven European communities (n = 1187) were collected. Associations among <b>fruit</b> <b>juices,</b> soft drinks, the respective parenting practices and the child’s water consumption were assessed by parental questionnaires. Results: The consumption of water was inversely associated with that of soft drinks but not with the consumption of <b>fruit</b> <b>juices.</b> The child’s water intake was favorably influenced when stricter parenting practices towards soft drinks were adopted (e. g., less parental allowance, low home availability and high parental self-efficacy in managing intake). There was less influence observed of parenting practices towards <b>fruit</b> <b>juices.</b> <b>Fruit</b> <b>juices</b> were consumed more often than soft drinks. Conclusions: Low consumption of soft drinks—and not of fruit juices—was associated with high water consumption in children in the current study. Moreover, parenting practices towards both <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> and soft drinks were associated with the water intake of the children, irrespective of their socio-economic status...|$|R

Aim: To compare the acidogenic potential of sugar free <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> with <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> containing sugar by evaluating the plaque pH changes, following consumption of the above drinks. Design: The study was carried out on 10 children in the age group of 8 - 15 years. The four <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> used were 1) orange juice with added sugar 2) orange juice with no added sugar 3) apple juice with added sugar 4) apple juice with no added sugar. Sucrose rinse of 10 % was used as control group. The endogenous pH of the <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> and control was assessed using digital pH meter. The plaque pH was assessed at the baseline and after the consumption of the drinks at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 60 minutes time interval using the plaque-harvesting technique. The obtained results were compiled and subjected to statistical analysis using paired t-test. Result: All the <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> showed drop in plaque pH.

Conclusion: The <b>fruit</b> <b>juices</b> labeled with "no added sugar" or "free from added sugar", contained substantial quantities of sugar and are equally cariogenic as are fruit drinks with added sugar...|$|R
