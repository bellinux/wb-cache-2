2500|$|Consistently {{cited as}} one of football's meanest, toughest, and most feared players, Butkus was renown for his intimidating profile and style of play. He was known to snarl at the {{opposition}} prior to plays. Quarterbacks would complain of Butkus biting them in pileups. Lions tight end Charlie Sanders recalled Butkus poking him in the eyes with <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> face mask. He once intercepted a pass from Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton near the goal line, and instead of taking {{the ball into the}} end zone for an easy touchdown, he took aim at Tarkenton to run him over. When asked by a reporter if he was as the rumors suggested, he replied, [...] "I'm not so mean. I wouldn't ever go out to hurt anybody deliberately. Unless it was, you know, important—like a league game or something." ...|$|E
60|$|His {{companion}} {{raised his}} hat, and ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair.|$|E
60|$|He started, and ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> rough hair in an overwrought manner.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} Mr. Tiernan stood silent before her, his legs apart, <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> running <b>through</b> <b>his</b> bristly hair.|$|R
60|$|Philip waited. Mr. Perkins ran <b>his</b> lean <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{beard and}} looked at Philip. He seemed to be {{thinking}} over {{what he wanted to}} say.|$|R
6000|$|Beginning, {{from the}} mere force of habit, some half-delirious {{reference}} to the weather, Edwin suddenly stopped, passed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> wildly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, and again said, with deep earnestness,--"Emma." ...|$|R
60|$|Morris ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> untidy {{hair and}} opened his lips to answer.|$|E
60|$|And Adolph {{tossed his}} head, and passed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> scented hair, with a grace.|$|E
60|$|Poor old Corky ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{hair in a}} temperamental sort of way. He groaned.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the moment}} he did not answer her at all, but sat facing the fire, and running <b>his</b> fat <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> uncombed hair. [...] "Mrs. Smiley!" [...] he said; [...] "I {{remember}} when she was kitchen-maid at old Pott's." ...|$|R
60|$|Philip did not answer. Mr. Perkins, holding himself oddly as {{he always}} did, like a figure in one of Perugino's pictures, drew <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> thoughtfully <b>through</b> <b>his</b> beard. He looked at Philip {{as though he were}} trying to {{understand}} and then abruptly told him he might go.|$|R
60|$|Spike sat up, groaning. Equipped {{though he}} was by nature with a skull of the purest and most solid ivory, the fall had disconcerted him. His eyes, like those of Shakespeare's poet, rolling in a fine frenzy, did glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven. He passed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> tenderly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{vermilion}} hair.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Perkins, slowly {{dragging}} <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> beard, {{looked at}} him thoughtfully. He seemed to speak almost to himself.|$|E
60|$|The German seemed bewildered; he ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> bushy hair as {{if trying}} to {{remember}} what he had said.|$|E
60|$|The young pugilist, {{who had a}} curious, lanky figure, and a craggy, bony face, passed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{close-cropped}} hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only last night," [...] {{continued}} Queeker to himself, {{still standing}} bolt upright {{in a frenzy}} of inspiration, and running <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> fiercely <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, so as to make it stand bolt upright too--"only last night I heard old Durant say he could not make up his mind where to go to spend the autumn this year. Why not Ramsgate? why not Ramsgate? ...|$|R
60|$|The sun was {{beginning}} to send dwarf shadows toward the east {{when he reached the}} Gulch. Here a new trepidation seized him. How would his partners receive the news of his utter failure? HE was happy, for he had gained Kitty through it. But they? For a moment {{it seemed to him that}} he had purchased <b>his</b> happiness <b>through</b> their loss. He stopped, took off his hat, and ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> remorsefully <b>through</b> <b>his</b> damp curls.|$|R
60|$|Teeka {{rolled her}} eyes in his {{direction}} and strained the squirming mite still closer to her. Tarzan came nearer. Teeka drew away and bared her fangs. Tarzan was nonplussed. In all his experiences with Teeka, never before had she bared fangs at him other than in play; but today {{she did not look}} playful. Tarzan ran <b>his</b> brown <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> thick, black hair, cocked his head upon one side, and stared. Then he edged a bit nearer, craning his neck to have a better look at the thing which Teeka cuddled.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good-evening, sir,' said Mr Folair, {{taking off}} the tall hat, and running <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair. 'I bring a communication. Hem!' ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} Mr. Kipps rubbed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair with an {{expression}} of some perplexity {{and went back to the}} beginning.|$|E
60|$|He stopped, and ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, in all directions; his {{features}} fidgetting and distorting themselves ominously, while {{he looked at}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... "He disapproves of it, of course--strongly, perhaps. Well, {{though my}} dear girl {{is worthy of}} any station; and a man like me, devoted to mercantile interests, may hold his head up {{anywhere}} {{as one of the}} props of this commercial country," [...] (he ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> rapidly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, and tried to look independent), [...] "still I am prepared to admit, under all the circumstances--I say under all the circumstances--that his disapproval is very natural, and was very much to be expected--very much indeed." ...|$|R
60|$|As Obergatz talked Jane had {{recovered}} her spear from the carcass of the antelope and commenced busying {{herself with the}} removal of the hide. The man made no attempt to assist her, but stood by talking and watching her, the while he continually ran <b>his</b> filthy <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> matted hair and beard. His face and body were caked with dirt and he was naked except for a torn greasy hide about his loins. His weapons consisted of a club and knife of Waz-don pattern, that he had stolen from the city of Bu-lur; but what more greatly concerned the woman than his filth or his armament were his cackling laughter and the strange expression in his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye don't," [...] said Bill, {{raising his}} head, {{with a sudden}} twinkle in his eyes. [...] "Then ye don't know Snapshot Harry. Do ye suppose he's goin' {{to sit down and}} twiddle his thumbs with that skin game played on him? No, sir," [...] he continued, with a {{thoughtful}} deliberation, drawing <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> slowly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> long beard, [...] "he spotted it--and smelt out the whole trick ez soon ez he opened that box, and that's why he didn't foller us! He'll hunt those sneak thieves into h-ll but what he'll get 'em, and," [...] he went on still more slowly, [...] "by the livin' hokey! I reckon, sonny, that's jest how ye'll get your chance to chip in!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} said that other was the road to Butterfield," [...] said he, running <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> shaggy {{whiskers}} in a puzzled way.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could see}} it come! I {{could see it}} come!" [...] he exclaimed, passing <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair with the same perplexed {{expression}} as before.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thank you, I have a headache, {{and walking}} may take it off," [...] said Norman, {{taking off his}} hat and passing <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Little pink {{of a girl}} {{worked it}} for me—a real juicy little peach—chipped somehow or other"—he had {{arranged}} his white bow—he had drawn forth two rings, one a great signet, the other gorgeous with diamonds, and had adjusted them on his fat white fingers; he had run <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> delicately, <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, which rippled backwards a trifle tawdrily—being fine and somewhat sapless; he had produced a box, containing a cream carnation with suitable greenery; he had flicked himself with a silk handkerchief, and had dusted his patent-leather shoes; lastly, he had pursed up his lips and surveyed himself with great satisfaction in the mirror. Then {{he was ready to}} be presented.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{very glad}} to see Mr. Fulmort,' said Mr. Prendergast, his only answer in words to all this, though while it was going on, {{as if she were}} pulling him by wires, as she imperiously waved her bulrush, he had stuck his pen into the inkstand, run <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> in desperation <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, risen from his seat, gazed about in vain for his boots, and felt as fruitlessly {{on the back of the}} door for a coat to replace the loose alpaca article that hung on his shoulders.|$|R
60|$|Supper over, {{the tables}} dormant were cleared away as by magic and {{trestles}} and bancals arranged around the blazing fire, {{for there was}} a bitter nip in the air. The Lady Tiphaine had sunk back in her cushioned chair, and her long dark lashes drooped low over her sparkling eyes. Alleyne, glancing at her, noted that her breath came quick and short, and that her cheeks had blanched to a lily white. Du Guesclin eyed her keenly from time to time, and passed <b>his</b> broad brown <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> crisp, curly black hair with {{the air of a}} man who is perplexed in his mind.|$|R
6000|$|Ezekiel {{glanced around}} him and contemplatively ran <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> beard. [...] "It ain't Joan Salisbury nor Dick Demorest ez giv' him that start! Humph! Wa'al--I wanter know!" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Lincoln passed <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> tousled hair. His thick {{lower lip}} crept over {{in front of}} the upper one, A gleam stirred in the deep-set gray eyes.|$|E
6000|$|He put <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> gray, untidy hair. [...] "That's {{the only}} comb I have {{that is at}} hand when I want it," [...] he went on, {{regardless}} of her agony.|$|E
60|$|A gusty March morning had {{subsided}} into a sunshiny afternoon, {{nearly two}} years ago, when a young man, slender, above the middle height, with a physiognomy thoughtful yet delicate, his brown hair worn long, slight whiskers, on his chin a tuft, knocked {{at the door of}} a house in Carrington Street, May Fair. His mien and his costume denoted a character of the class of artists. He wore a pair of green trousers, braided with a black stripe down their sides, puckered towards the waist, yet fitting with considerable precision to the boot of French leather that enclosed a well-formed foot. His waistcoat was of maroon velvet, displaying a steel watch-chain of refined manufacture, and a black satin cravat, with a coral brooch. His bright blue frockcoat was frogged and braided like his trousers. As the knocker fell from the primrose-coloured glove that screened his hand, he uncovered, and passing <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> rapidly <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, resumed his new silk hat, which he placed rather on one side of his head.|$|R
6000|$|We {{ascended the}} steps, and {{passing through the}} portico went into the hall by what seemed to me a doorless way. It was not really so, as I {{discovered}} later; the doors, of which there were several, some of colored glass, others of some other material, were simply thrust back into receptacles within the wall itself, which was five or six feet thick. The hall was the noblest I had ever seen; it had a stone and bronze fireplace some twenty or thirty feet long on one side, and several tall arched doorways on the other. The spaces between the doors were covered with sculpture, its material being a blue-gray stone combined or inlaid with a yellow metal, the effect being indescribably rich. The floor was mosaic of many dark colors, but with no definite pattern, and the concave roof was deep red in color. Though beautiful, it was somewhat somber, as the light was not strong. At all events, that is how it struck me at first on {{coming in from the}} bright sunlight. Nor, it appeared, was I alone in experiencing such a feeling. As soon as we were inside, the old gentleman, removing his cap and passing <b>his</b> thin <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> white hair, looked around him, and addressing some of the others, who were bringing in small round tables and placing them about the hall, said: [...] "No, no; let us sup this evening where we can look at the sky." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{crouched}} down and carefully put <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>through</b> the thorns into the round {{door of the}} nest.|$|R
