5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children <b>in</b> <b>preschool</b> classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to examine in which ways {{environmental}} and health inspectors work with the topic hazardous substances <b>in</b> <b>preschools.</b> The study was performed by interviewing 26 environmental- and health inspectors by telephone or email, foremost in Västerbotten and Norrbotten counties but also in some municipalities in the middle and south parts of Sweden. The respondents were divided into two groups and named group 1 (those who work with hazardous substances <b>in</b> <b>preschools)</b> and 2 (those who do not work with hazardous substances <b>in</b> <b>preschools).</b> Overall the environmental and health inspectors work with information and inspection regarding this area. They see economic resources and lacking knowledge as challenges and would like more guidance from authorities. Furthermore they call for local politicians showing more interest and involvement regarding hazardous substances <b>in</b> <b>preschools</b> and they think that this is one of the most important success factors along with a political decision, financial means and knowledge. In conclusion hazardous substances <b>in</b> <b>preschools</b> can be a complex area involving several challenges and needs for environmental and health inspectors. However the respondents in this study prove that there are ways to work with this particular area, even for smaller municipalities. ...|$|R

40|$|Scheduled {{time for}} {{reflective}} work is common at many Swedish preschools. Reflection {{is a complex}} concept {{that is being used}} with many different purposes <b>in</b> <b>preschools.</b> The reflective work <b>in</b> Swedish <b>preschools</b> today {{has its roots in the}} theories from Vygotskij about how children learn by watching and cooperating with others. Also, many Swedish preschools have taken inspiration from the <b>preschools</b> <b>in</b> Reggio Emilia in Italy, who see the reflective work as something necessary in their work around children’s learning processes. “The learning group” is a way of seeing children and adults as members of groups who capture knowledge by social interaction, taken from the <b>preschools</b> <b>in</b> Reggio Emilia. <b>In</b> 1998, Swedish <b>preschools</b> got their first curriculum, which also took inspiration from Vygotskij and his visions of children’s learning. The aim of this study is to find out how reflective work can be done at some Swedish preschools, and also to investigate a group of teacher’s thoughts on reflective work. The issues in my study are: What meaning can lie in the concept of reflection <b>in</b> <b>preschools?</b> <b>In</b> what situations can teachers and children <b>in</b> <b>preschools</b> use reflection? What can be the purpose of this reflection? To answer these questions, I did interviews with teachers and observations of meetings and of the work that was being done with the children. The result shows that the term of reflection is ambiguous and is being used with different interpretations <b>in</b> the <b>preschools</b> I have studied. Reflection is for instance retelling events, solving problems, cooperating and curiosity. Teachers and children use reflection in various situations everyday, both at planned and spontaneous activities. The purpose of the reflection at the preschools I have visited was for instance to find a focus in working with the children, to know how to move on and to get deeper into what you do...|$|R
