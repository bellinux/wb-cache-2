5|$|Arnhem {{restored}} much of Model's self-confidence, {{which had}} been shaken by the experience of Normandy. From September to December, he fought another Allied thrust to a standstill, this time by Omar Bradley's U.S. 12th Army Group into the Hürtgen Forest and Aachen. While he interfered less in the day-to-day movements of his units than at Arnhem, he still kept himself <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> on the situation, slowing the Allies' progress, inflicting heavy casualties and taking {{full advantage of the}} fortifications of the Westwall, known to the Allies as the Siegfried Line.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{storm of}} {{criticism}} from scientists, particularly those at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Leó Szilárd and Harold Urey were particularly notable critics. The bill created a powerful administrator and deputy administrator, and specifically stated {{that they might be}} members of the armed forces. It was feared that they would dominate the part-time commissioners. The fact that the bill emphasized that the administrator had to keep the deputy <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> further aroused suspicion that the administrator would be an Army officer and the deputy a Navy officer. The secrecy provisions also frightened many scientists; it contained severe penalties of up to ten years imprisonment and $10,000 in fines for security breaches. The Chicago Sun headline accused the War Department of attempting to railroad the legislation through Congress.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of January 29, Mậu and Khiêm alerted the rebel troops to assume their {{positions}} around Saigon. These included many of those used in the first coup: armored cars and tanks and some elements from the 5th and 7th Divisions, two airborne battalions and one Marine battalion {{and an assortment of}} Special Forces, Ranger and Civil Guard units. A number of American officers and embassy officials were alerted to be in their offices at 02:00. Lodge was kept <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> throughout the night. As the time approached, Khánh donned his paratrooper uniform and headed to the military headquarters at Tan Son Nhut, where he saw that the compound was empty apart from a few guards. When he telephoned Khiêm, he found that his co-conspirator had overslept after having forgotten to set his alarm clock. Despite this, by daybreak, Khánh had taken over the government without a shot being fired.|$|E

5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the shared ability of humans to reason should {{be the basis of}} morality, and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, {{believed that}} all humans {{should have the right to}} common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even if they were the patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must be able to make a <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient, so they must be informed of all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.|$|E
25|$|Outraged {{members of}} Congress demanded an {{investigation}} into the handling of the politically sensitive case. Over the next year, Senate investigators learned that FBI field agents had not kept FBI officials <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> of their actions, that FBI field agents may have improperly approved illegal actions, and that FBI officials did not keep DOJ and DOL officials <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> of their relationship with Presser.|$|E

50|$|Chester v Afshar 2004 UKHL 41 is an {{important}} English tort law case regarding causation in a medical negligence context.

25|$|Patient-informed consent is {{a medical}} {{principle}} stating that patients should be <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> about {{the manner in which}} anesthesia will be administered to them. It is a fundamental ethical and legal principle and is considered essential for the patient autonomy. The American Society of Anesthesiologists and the American Osteopathic Board of Anesthesiology support this principle. In Germany, the law requires that prior to anaesthesia, informed consent of the patient must be obtained by the anaesthetist.|$|E

25|$|In 1974 Congress {{passed the}} National Research Act {{and created a}} {{commission}} to study and write regulations governing studies involving human participants. Within the US Department of Health and Human Services, the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) was established to oversee clinical trials. Now studies require informed consent, communication of diagnosis, and accurate reporting of test results. Institutional review boards (IRBs), including laypeople, are established in scientific research groups and hospitals to review study protocols and protect patient interests, to ensure that participants are <b>fully</b> <b>informed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because the {{procedures}} {{used in the}} algorithm have nearly O(1) cost, the overall cost of the algorithm is close to linear {{in the size of}} the expression for which a type is to be inferred. This is in strong contrast to many other attempts to derive type inference algorithms, which often came out to be NP-hard, if not undecidable with respect to termination. Thus the HM performs as well as the best <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> type-checking algorithms can. Type-checking here means that an algorithm does not have to find a proof, but only to validate a given one.|$|E

25|$|Because of its {{controversial}} nature, {{different countries}} vary {{in the discussion}} of bestiality. Often sexual matters are the subject of legal or regulatory requirement. In 2005 the UK broadcasting regulator (OFCOM) updated its code stating that freedom of expression {{is at the heart of}} any democratic state. Adult audiences should be informed as to what they will be viewing or hearing, and the young, who cannot make a <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> choice for themselves, should be protected. Hence a watershed and other precautions were set up for explicit sexual material, to protect young people. Zoophile activity and other sexual matters may be discussed, but only in an appropriate context and manner.|$|E
25|$|A {{fiduciary}} {{must not}} {{profit from the}} fiduciary position. This includes any benefits or profits which, although unrelated to the fiduciary position, came about because of an opportunity that the fiduciary position afforded. It is unnecessary that the principal would {{have been unable to}} make the profit; if the fiduciary makes a profit, by virtue of his role as fiduciary for the principal, then the fiduciary must report the profit to the principal. If the principal provides <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> consent, then the fiduciary may keep the benefit and be absolved of any liability for what would be a breach of fiduciary duty. If this requirement is not met then the property is deemed by the court to be held by the fiduciary on constructive trust for the principal.|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} in France, Monroe addressed the National Convention, receiving a standing applause for his speech celebrating republicanism. He experienced several early diplomatic successes, including {{the protection of}} U.S. trade from French attacks. He also used his influence to win the release of Thomas Paine and Adrienne de La Fayette, {{the wife of the}} Marquis de Lafayette. Months after Monroe arrived in France, the U.S. and Great Britain concluded the Jay Treaty, outraging both the French and Monroe—not <b>fully</b> <b>informed</b> about the treaty prior to its publication. Despite the undesirable effects of the Jay Treaty on Franco-American relations, Monroe won French support for U.S. navigational rights on the Mississippi River—the mouth of which was controlled by Spain—and in 1795 the U.S. and Spain signed Pinckney's Treaty. The treaty granted the U.S. limited rights to use the port of New Orleans.|$|E
