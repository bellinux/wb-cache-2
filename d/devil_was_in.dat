For example, in the opening conversation of the play, speculating as to how Talbot could have been taken prisoner, Exeter exclaims [...] "shall we think the subtle-witted French/Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,/By magic verse have contrived his end" [...] (1.1.25–27). Later, discussing the French capture of Orléans, Talbot claims it was [...] "contrived by art and baleful sorcery" [...] (2.1.15). Indeed, the French make similar claims about the English. During the Battle of Patay for example, according to the messenger, [...] "The French exclaimed the <b>devil</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> arms" [...] (1.1.125).

2500|$|Critics of [...] "women's literature" [...] {{considered}} some {{of these}} strengths to be weaknesses. They attacked her conversational style as unprofessional, feminine, and too spontaneous. Many male critics labeled her as [...] "sentimental." [...] This has led to counter-criticism about what exactly [...] "sentimental" [...] writing is, and why it is considered bad. The criticism showed women's lower status in society almost as well as Fern did in her work—who decides the standards by which literature is judged, and who does the judging? [...] Nathaniel Hawthorne praised her as {{an exception to the}} [...] "damned mob of scribbling women", who wrote [...] "as if the <b>devil</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> her". [...] Fern was straightforward when she wrote of subjects such as men's economic and social victimization of women.|$|E
2500|$|Fern wrote two novels. Her first, Ruth Hall (1854), {{was based}} on her life - the years of {{happiness}} with Eldredge, the poverty she endured after he died and lack of help from male relatives, and her struggle to achieve financial independence as a journalist. Most of the characters are thinly veiled versions of people in her world. She took revenge by her unflattering portrayals of several who had treated her uncharitably when she most needed help, including her father, her in-laws, her brother N.P. Willis, and two newspaper editors. When Fern's identity was revealed shortly after the novel's publication, some critics believed it scandalous that she had attacked her own relatives; they decried her lack of filial piety and her want of [...] "womanly gentleness" [...] in such characterizations. At the same time, the book also garnered positive attention. The author Nathaniel Hawthorne, who had earlier complained about the [...] "damned mob of scribbling women", wrote to his publisher in early 1855 in praise of the novel. He said he [...] "enjoyed it a great deal. The woman writes as if the <b>devil</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> her, {{and that is the}} only condition in which a woman ever writes anything worth reading." ...|$|E
