In addition to offering lower-fat menu item such as salads, the company has updated its nutrition guides to include dietary guidelines and other nutritional data. One of its reactions to the concerns over trans-fats was to initiate a program in January 2008 to phase out added trans-fat in its products, and to switch to pure vegetable oils that are free of <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fats.</b> The program ended in early 2009 with a complete changeover to the new oils. Most, but not all, of the products contain no added trans-fats; some products, such as the beef used in the hamburgers, still contain naturally occurring trans-fats.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids, or {{fatty acid}} {{residues}} {{when they are}} part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon linolenic acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes linolenic acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fats</b> and oils.|$|E
40|$|A {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} in adult albino rats to study the influence on lipid fractions of serum and various body tissues by feeding diets containing sarsoon oil, canola oil and <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat.</b> The results revealed that serum cholesterol decreased in sarsoon (- 14. 3 %) and canola oil (- 9. 9 %) while increased in <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> (26. 1 %) fed rats. Similarly serum triglycerides decreased in sarsoon (- 22. 6 %) and canola oil (- 21. 3 %) while increased in <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> fed rats (24. 3 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the lipid profiles of the hepatic and adipose tissues of Wistar rats treated for 21 days with a diet high in saturated fat (high saturated fat, n= 6) or high in <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat,</b> that is, having 50 % partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in its composition (high <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat,</b> n= 6), and compare them to those of a control group (control group, n= 6). METHODS: Adipose tissue and total hepatic fat were higher in the saturated fat group than in the <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> group. Hepatic lipid peroxidation was greatest in the saturated fat group, with consequent lower hepatic vitamin E and A levels. In contrast, serum vitamin A was highest in the saturated fat group. Analysis of hepatic lipid fractions found more cholesterol and less high density lipoprotein-cholesterol in the <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> group. The <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> group had the highest levels of triacylglycerols, followed by the saturated fat group. RESULTS: Significant amounts of trans fatty acids were detected in the hepatic and adipose tissues of the <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> group. Among the identified fatty acids, 18 : 1 n 9 had a higher positive association with hepatic cholesterol and triacylglycerols, and a higher negative association with high density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil promotes greater accumulation of cholesterol and triacylglycerols in the liver than saturated fats. CONCLUSION: Trans fatty acids were incorporated into hepatocytes and adipocytes in a highly efficient manner...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY-Two {{vegetable}} fats {{commonly used in}} commercial and home deep-fat frying of foods, and fractions thereoF, were tested for carcinogenicity in NIH Black rats. The following fractions of fresh and heated (used re-peatedly for deep-fat frying) <b>hydrogenated</b> vegetable <b>fat</b> and corn oil were prepared and tested: urea adduct, non urea adduct, nonsaponifiable fraction, and volatiles. Intramuscular injections of the non urea adducts of fresh and heated <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> and of corn oil, repeated every 2 weeks for 14 - 17 months, induced sarcomas {{at the site of}} injection in NIH Black rats. The incidence was higher in rats receiving the non urea adducts from corn oil than from <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat,</b> and higher also in the nonurea adducts from heated than from fresh fats. Few tumors, except papillomas of the forestomach, were induced in the alimentary tract or at other sites in 426 rats by the daily feeding for 17 months of fresh and heated fats and the urea and non urea adducts of corn oil, with and without added benzo[a]pyrene.

25|$|Production of <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fats</b> {{increased}} steadily {{until the}} 1960s, as processed vegetable fats replaced animal fats in the United States and other Western countries.

25|$|Animal-based fats {{were once}} the only trans fats {{consumed}}, but {{by far the}} largest amount of trans fat consumed today is created by the processed food industry as a side effect of partially hydrogenating unsaturated plant fats (generally vegetable oils).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} fat type {{in the structure of}} ice cream, during its production by means of rheo-optical analysis. Fat plays an important part in the ice cream structure formation. It's responsible for the air stabilization, flavor release, texture and melting properties. The objective {{of this study was to}} use a rheological method to predict the fat network formation in ice cream with three types of <b>fats</b> (<b>hydrogenated,</b> low trans and palm fat). The three formulations were produced using the same methodology and ratio of ingredients. Rheo-optical measurements were taken before and after the ageing process, and the maximum compression force, overrun and melting profile were calculated in the finished product. The rheological analysis showed a better response from the ageing process from the <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat,</b> followed by the low trans fat. The formulation with palm fat showed greater differences between the three, where through the rheological tests a weaker destabilization of the fat globule membrane by the emulsifier was suggested. The overrun, texture measurements and meltdown profile has shown the distinction on the structure formation by the <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> from the other fats...|$|R

2500|$|In his 2009 book Cholesterol and The French Paradox, Frank Cooper {{argues that}} the French paradox {{is due to the}} lack of {{hydrogenated}} and trans fats in the French diet. The French diet is based on natural saturated fats such as butter, cheese and cream that the human body finds easy to metabolize, because they are rich in shorter saturated fatty acids ranging from the 4-carbon butyric acid to the 16-carbon palmitic acid. But the American diet includes greater amounts of saturated fats made via hydrogenating vegetable oils which include longer 18- and 20-carbon fatty acids.

2500|$|Prior to 1910, dietary fats {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} butterfat, beef tallow, and lard. During Napoleon's reign in France {{in the early}} 19th century, a type of margarine was invented to feed the troops using tallow and buttermilk; it did not gain acceptance in the United States. In the early 20th century, soybeans began to be imported into the United States {{as a source of}} protein; soybean oil was a by-product. What to do with that oil became an issue. At the same time, there was not enough butterfat available for consumers. The method of hydrogenating fat and turning a liquid fat into a solid one had been discovered, and now the ingredients (soybeans) and the [...] "need" [...] (shortage of butter) were there. Later, the means for storage, the refrigerator, was a factor in trans fat development. The fat industry found that <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fats</b> provided some special features to margarines, which allowed margarine, unlike butter, to be taken out of the refrigerator and immediately spread on bread. By some minor changes to the chemical composition of hydrogenated fat, such hydrogenated fat was found to provide superior baking properties compared to lard. Margarine made from hydrogenated soybean oil began to replace butterfat. Hydrogenated fat such as Crisco and Spry, sold in England, began to replace butter and lard in the baking of bread, pies, cookies, and cakes in 1920.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Using rats we {{examined}} whether maternal intake of <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> rich in {{trans fatty acids}} affects brain fatty acid profile, hypothalamic content of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate- 1 proteins, and the hypophagic effect of centrally administered insulin in 3 -mo-old male progeny. Methods: Throughout pregnancy and lactation, Wistar rats ate isocaloric/normolipidic, diets with soybean oil (control) or soybean oil-derived <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> (trans diet) as a fat source. Upon weaning, the trans offspring continued on the trans diet (trans group) or were switched to a control diet (trans-control group). Results: Compared with control rats, trans rats had lower brain - levels of eicosapentaenoic acid. Compared with trans rats, trans-control rats had increased levels of total polyunsaturated fatty acids and arachidonic acid and decreased levels of trans fatty acids, saturated fatty acids, and monounsaturated fatty acids. Insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate- 1 levels were significantly lower (44 % and 38 %, respectively) in trans than in control rats. in trans-control rats, insulin receptor was 26 % lower (P < 0. 05), whereas insulin receptor substrate- 1 was 50 % lower, than in control rats. Insulin decreased 24 -h feeding in control (27 %) and trans (38 %) rats but {{failed to do so}} in trans-control rats. the latter group had increased-serum glucose levels. Conclusions: the data suggest that the early (intrauterine/perinatal) exposure to <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat</b> rich in trans fatty acids programmed the hypothalamic feeding control mechanisms. As young adults, only trans-control animals showed loss of insulin-induced hypophagia, indicating that the mismatch between early and later nutritional environments was relevant. However, the trans group also, showed signs of altered appetite signaling mechanisms, suggesting that the early adaptations may have deleterious consequences later in life. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The results showed that a fractionation time increase caused an increased yield and decreased iodine value for the high melting or stearin fractions. The thermal behaviors and solid fat index (SFI) of these stearin fractions were different from the original fat, especially for stearin from acetone fractionation. The major fatty acid in this stearin fraction was arachidic acid (C 20 : 0) consisting of more than 90 %. Overall, we demonstrated that acetone fractionation of RKF at 25 °C for 24 h is effective for producing a solid fat fraction, which has comparable crystallizing and melting properties to commercial <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>fat.</b> The fractionated rambutan fat obtained by this process may lead to its potential use in specific food products...|$|R
