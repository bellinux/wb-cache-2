40|$|The {{effect of}} in situ {{variability}} of Cold In-Place Pavement Recycling (CIPR) is further {{exacerbated by the}} inherent sensitivity of in-place stabilized materials such as those treated with foamed asphalt. Besides, {{it is often difficult}} to obtain intact cores of the recycled materials <b>in</b> a <b>non-cured</b> <b>condition.</b> As a result quality control of the CIPR technique can be highly uncertain. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been identified as an engineering diagnostic tool that can accurately quantify in situ structural composition and help to reduce the uncertainty associated with in situ thickness estimation. This paper summarizes the principles of GPR, discusses its use as an engineering diagnostic tool in terms of quality control of the CIPR technique using foamed asphalt treatment and presents results of a related field experiment performed by the Laboratory of Highway Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). For this purpose the dielectric properties of the recycled layer are estimated and related thickness values are determined and compared to ground truth data. The results demonstrate the compatibility of CIPR to mitigate the uncertainty associated with the investigated pavement rehabilitation technique...|$|R
40|$|Recurrent event {{data with}} a {{fraction}} of subjects having zero event are often seen in randomized clinical trials. Those with zero event may belong to a cured (or non-susceptible) fraction. Event dependence refers to the situation that a person’s past event history affects his future event occurrences. In the presence of event dependence, an intervention may {{have an impact on}} the event rate <b>in</b> the <b>non-cured</b> through two pathways— a primary effect directly on the outcome event and a secondary effect mediated through event dependence. The primary effect combined with the secondary effect is the total effect. We propose a frailty mixture model and a two-step estimation procedure for the estimation of the effect of an intervention on the probability of cure and the total effect on event rate <b>in</b> the <b>non-cured.</b> A summary measure of intervention effects is derived. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by simulation. Data on respiratory exacerbations from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial are re-analyzed for illustration...|$|R
40|$|Therapeutic {{failure of}} {{benznidazole}} (BZ) is widely documented in Chagas disease {{and has been}} primarily associated with variations in the drug susceptibility of Trypanosoma cruzi strains. In humans, therapeutic success has been assessed by the negativation of anti-T. cruzi antibodies, a process that may take up to 10 years. A protocol for early screening of the drug resistance of infective strains would be valuable for orienting physicians towards alternative therapies, {{with a combination of}} existing drugs or new anti-T. cruzi agents. We developed a procedure that couples the isolation of parasites by haemoculture with quantification of BZ susceptibility in the resultant epimastigote forms. BZ activity was standardized with reference strains, which showed IC 50 to BZ between 7. 6 - 32 µM. The assay was then applied to isolates from seven chronic patients prior to administration of BZ therapy. The IC 50 of the strains varied from 15. 6 ± 3 - 51. 4 ± 1 µM. Comparison of BZ susceptibility of the pre-treatment isolates of patients considered cured by several criteria and of non-cured patients indicates that the assay does not predict therapeutic outcome. A two-fold increase in BZ resistance in the post-treatment isolates of two patients was verified. Based on the profile of nine microsatellite loci, sub-population selection <b>in</b> <b>non-cured</b> patients was ruled out. FAPESPCNP...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Strongyloidiasis, a human {{intestinal}} infection with Strongyloides stercoralis, {{is difficult to}} treat with drugs. The factors influencing this phenomenon remain unclear. To determine the host factors involved in response to treatment, 46 patients with strongyloidiasis were treated with albendazole, followed-up for 1 year, and separated into two groups: cured and non-cured. Serum levels of specific IgA, IgE, IgG, IgG 1, and IgG 4 antibodies were estimated using S. stercoralis antigen. Significantly higher titers of IgG 4 antibody were observed <b>in</b> the <b>non-cured</b> group than <b>in</b> the cured group (P 5 0. 016). A total of 88 patients were typed for HLA-DRB 1 alleles and analyzed for serum levels of antibody. The S. stercoralis-specific IgG 4 antibody titers were significantly higher in the HLA-DRB 1 * 0901 -positive group than in the negative group (corrected P 5 0. 044). These results suggest that HLA-DRB 1 * 0901 is a possible genetic marker for resistance to treatment of S. stercoralis {{that is associated with}} elevation of S. stercoralis-specific IgG 4 antibody titer. Strongyloidiasis is a human intestinal nematode infection caused by Strongyloides stercoralis. It causes chronic bowel problems, especially in immunocompromised hosts, in which systemic migration of larvae provokes a serious ill-ness due to the unique life cycle of autoinfection of thi...|$|R
40|$|The {{bisphenol}} E cyanate ester (BECy) and Poly(ether sulfone) (PES) blend is a {{very unique}} system with a promising future in the aerospace and military industries; for it combines the positive attributes of both polymers. BECy is a thermoset that has very high strength; performs well in high temperature environments; {{and it is a}} flowable liquid at room temperature, which allows for easy processing. PES is a thermoplastic that is a good toughening agent with good thermal attributes. However, there is much about the BECy-PES blend {{that has yet to be}} discovered. Thus, a study was performed in collaboration between Dr. Samy Madbouly and Dr. Nicola Bowler that sought to further characterize the BECy-PES blend <b>in</b> a <b>non-cured</b> state. Different compositions of the blend were created and characterized with rheology; Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC); and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA). As a result of the rheology study, blend samples with high concentrations of PES (above 40 wt%) had higher viscosities than samples with lower concentrations of this polymer. The DSC data indicated that samples with higher concentrations of PES also had higher glass transition temperatures than the samples with lower concentrations. Last, the TGA data suggested that the blend undergoes curing at 200 °C...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{difficult}} to completely eradicate strongyloidiasis, a human intestinal nematode infection with Strongy-loides stercoralis with drugs, especially in males. To find host factors involved in the response to treatment, patients infected with S. stercoralis were examined for S. stercoralis-specific antibody titers {{and the effect of}} treatment with albendazole on these titers were determined. The cure rate was slightly but not significantly lower in males than in females (P 0. 108). However, a significantly higher titer of S. stercoralis-specific IgG 4 antibody was observed in males than in females (P 0. 0097), and the S. stercoralis-specific IgG 4 antibody titer was significantly higher <b>in</b> the male <b>non-cured</b> group than <b>in</b> the cured group (P 0. 035). These results suggest that elevation of the S. stercoralis-specific IgG 4 antibody titer is associated with resistance to treatment of S. stercoralis infection, especially in males...|$|R
40|$|Strongyloidiasis, a human {{intestinal}} infection caused by Strongyloides stercoralis (S. stercoralis), {{is difficult to}} cure with drugs. In particular, a decrease of the efficacy of treatment {{has been reported in}} patients dually infected with S. stercoralis and human T-cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV-I), both of which are endemic in Okinawa, Japan. However, the factors influencing this resistance remain unclear. In the present study, patients infected with S. stercoralis, with or without HTLV-I infection, were treated with albendazole, followed up for one year and separated into two groups, cured and non-cured. The cure rate of S. stercoralis was lower in HTLV-I carriers (P < 0 · 05). Serum levels of S. stercoralis-specific IgA, IgE, IgG, IgG 1 and IgG 4 antibodies were estimated, and a decrease of IgE (P < 0 · 05) and an increase of IgG 4 (P < 0 · 05) were observed <b>in</b> the <b>non-cured</b> group, especially <b>in</b> HTLV-I carriers. RT-PCR of cytokines using peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that S. stercoralis patients with HTLV-I showed a high frequency of expression of IFN-γ and TGF-β 1, whereas those without HTLV-I showed no expression of these cytokines. IFN-γ- and TGF-β 1 -positive HTLV-I carriers showed a decrease of IgE (P < 0 · 05), an increase of IgG 4 (P < 0 · 01) and a lower cure rate (P < 0 · 01) compared with those who were negative for both cytokines. These results suggest that persistent infection with HTLV-I affected S. stercoralis-specific immunity and reduced therapeutic efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Objective: Fascioliasis is a {{zoonotic}} parasitic disease, {{caused by}} the liver fluke, Fasciola spp [...] Human is occasional host when ingesting the metacercaria by eating contaminated aquatic vegetable. In the two past decades, human fasciolasis was emerging as a problem of public health in the Guilan province; in Anzali city. Triclabendazole is a novel anti-helmenthic that during {{recent years has been}} used for fascioliasis treatment in this region. The aim of the present work is to study alteration in haematological and liver function indices during human infection with Fasciola spp. pre and post treatment with triclabendazoleMaterials & Methods: The present work is a longitudinal clinical trail. In this regard, fifty confirmed fasciolasis patients, were chosen for parasitological, hematological and biochemical examinations pre-therapy as well as 1 and 6 months post-therapy. Formalin-ether and modified Telemann methods were used for stool examination. For Fasciola antibody detection ELISA technique was employed. Hematological and biochemical tests were performed by standard methods. Results: Results indicated that, triclabendazole efficacy was 74 % after usage as one dose of 20 mg/kg and reached to 88 % after repeating in the next month. Before triclabebdazole therapy the Hb and HCT of the patients were slightly found lower than normal ranges, meanwhile the ESR and eosinophil percentages were higher. However following receiving the drug, in the cured individuals, the indices returned to the normal ranges but <b>in</b> the <b>non-cured</b> individuals were not shifted to the normal. On the other hand liver function indices of the patients mostly were at normal ranges before and following drug therapy. Conclusion: In conclusion haematological indices could be valuable indicator for successful therapy of patients treated with triclabendazole...|$|R
40|$|Spores of {{foodborne}} pathogens can survive traditional thermal-processing schedules {{used in the}} manufacturing of processed meat products. Heat activated spores can germinate and grow to hazardous levels if these products are improperly chilled. Germination and outgrowth of Clostridium perfringens spores <b>in</b> cured and <b>non-cured</b> ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and poultry products that were cooked and chilled according to commercial processing schedules was studied. Inhibitory effects of organic acid salts on germination and outgrowth of C. perfringens during chilling and survival of vegetative cells and spores during subsequent storage at abusive refrigeration temperatures were evaluated. ^ Ready-to-Eat meat products were formulated to achieve final product concentrations of 1 % salt, 0. 2 % potassium tetrapyrophosphate and 0. 2 % starch. The products were subsequently ground and mixed with antimicrobials [sodium lactate (SL) and SL plus sodium diacetate (SD), 2. 5 %; buffered sodium citrate (BSC) and BSC plus SD, 1. 3 %]. The products were inoculated separately, with a three-strain cocktail of C. perfringens spores, mixed, vacuum packaged, commercially cooked to activate spores and chilled exponentially from 54. 5 to 7. 2 °C in 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 or 24 h. C. perfringens populations (vegetative and spore) were enumerated before and after cooking as well as during chilling and subsequent refrigerated (10 °C) storage for up to 60 days. ^ Germination and outgrowth of C. perfringens spores was observed during all cooling scenarios. Addition of antimicrobials prevented outgrowth of C. perfringens spores, while refrigeration at 10 °C for 60 days was detrimental to survival of vegetative cells. Germination and outgrowth of C. perfringens spores at isothermal temperature conditions was determined for each inoculated product to develop modeling equations and relative growth rates using the modified Gompertz and Baranyi models for non-linear regression. A modified Ratkowsky equation (square-root) was {{used to analyze the}} effect of temperature on relative growth rate. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta numerical method was used to develop final predictive models for each product. ^ Six predictive models were developed to describe germination and outgrowth of C. perfringens <b>in</b> cured and <b>non-cured</b> roast beef, turkey and pork during dynamic cooling. In general, all the models were capable of predicting growth when compared to most validation experiments. These predictive models will allow regulatory agencies as well as meat processors to evaluate product disposition in cases of cooling process deviations. Additionally, these models will allow processors to validate their processing operations with a food safety approach. ...|$|R
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) is a {{foodborne}} pathogen {{which has}} been implicated in several outbreaks of foodborne disease (listeriosis). The high risk population includes pregnant women, neonates and immunocompromised adults; among these populations the mortality rate can reach about 25 %. The U. S. Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 2, 500 cases of listeriosis occur each year, resulting in 500 deaths. ^ L. monocytogenes is ubiquitous in the environment and has been isolated from the air, water, soil and the gastrointestinal tract of humans. The USDA-FSIS requires RTE meat and poultry processors to adopt measures {{to minimize the risk}} of L. monocytogenes contamination of the post-lethality exposed products. The processors can adopt one of the three alternatives: (1) a post-lethality treatment and the addition of antimicrobial agents or process; (2) either a post-lethality treatment or the addition of antimicrobial agents to inhibit the growth of L. monocytogenes or (3) rely on sanitation to minimize L. monocytogenes contamination of the products. ^ The objective {{of this study was to}} develop and validate predictive models for the growth of L. monocytogenes on RTE cured and non-cured roast beef and turkey hams during refrigerated storage. ^ Cured and non-cured RTE roast beef and turkey hams were inoculated with a 5 -strain L. monocytogenes cocktail. Isothermal growth at 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16 °C was used to develop primary and secondary models for L. monocytogenes growth <b>in</b> cured and <b>non-cured</b> roast beef and turkey hams formulated with a 0, 1, 2, and 3 % blend of buffered sodium citrate and sodium diacetate (BSC+SDA). The products were vacuum-packaged and stored at 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 or 16 °C. L. monocytogenes populations were determined at weekly intervals (10, 13, and 16 °C), or biweekly intervals (1, 4, and 7 °C) over a 12 or 16 -week storage period. ^ Dynamic models were developed by numerically integrating the primary model (Baranyi equation) and a cubical spline function to interpolate the growth rate at various temperatures. A total of 14 dynamic models (six for the cured and non-cured RTE roast beef and eight for the cured and non-cured RTE turkey hams) were developed. Each dynamic model was validated using a non-isothermal, sinusoidal temperature profile for both RTE roast beef and turkey hams for a period of 90 days. ^ The dynamic model under-predicted the growth data. To make the models fail-safe, the initial physiological state of the cells (ho) value was reduced by 25 %. The model was then used to predict the growth data at isothermal conditions and fail-safe predictions of L. monocytogenes growth were obtained. ^ Accuracy factor (AF), bias factor (BF), and RMSE were calculated and evaluated between observed data and predicted values for the sinusoidal temperature profiles. The models for cured and non-cured RTE roast beef and turkey hams were capable of predicting growth with low RMSE values, and BF and AF values close to 1, indicating a good fit. These models will allow regulatory agencies as well as RTE processors to evaluate and validate their processing operations to control L. monocytogenes growth on RTE meat products and poultry products. ^ Keywords.
