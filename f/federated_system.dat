In {{contemporary}} multi-tiered command structures, {{we expect}} the individual <b>federated</b> <b>systems</b> to have local jurisdiction and autonomy of decision-making, i. e. {{as in the case}} of future unmanned vehicles. This allows a distributed command structure that is vastly more scalable than traditional centralized structures. However, as the individual <b>federated</b> <b>systems</b> make decisions pertinent to their situations; we need to ensure that the overall mission is satisfied. A mechanism allowing the <b>federated</b> <b>systems</b> to achieve their goals individually, while satisfying the global mission, is desirable. An approach to achieving this solution state uses techniques from the field of economic game theory. We present a generalized optimization framework for distributed command and control that can be applied to several domains, such as unmanned vehicle control, incident command or network traffic algorithms. Our framework is based on commercially available multi agent systems. We have built upon our previously reported work[5, 22, 23] on route optimizations and airspace sector design in an air traffic control network, by including the goals of interested entities, thus maximizing the “payoff ” to each agent. The work reported herein will be used as the basis for command and control tasks where rapid solving of large-scale optimization problems is needed, e. g. for flow management in air transportation, coordination between unmanned vehicles, and mission aware networks and protocols. ...|$|R
