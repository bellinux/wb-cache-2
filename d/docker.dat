Russell <b>Docker,</b> {{one of only two}} athletes to have competed for Britain at the 2002 Winter Paralympics, {{appeared}} in his second Games, this time in sitting events having switched to the use of a monoski. Sean Rose, also a sit-skier, and Liz Miller, a standing skier who uses a prosthetic leg, were the other British participants. The three athletes were members of the British Adaptive Ski Team, which is run by national ski charity Disability Snowsport UK. Each of the three skiers raced in four events in their respective categories; downhill, giant slalom, slalom and Super-G. Rose had the highest finish of the three; he placed sixth in the men's sitting downhill, 0.7 seconds outside of the medal positions. Russell <b>Docker</b> crashed in the same event and did not finish. <b>Docker</b> also failed to finish in the slalom, as did Rose in the giant slalom. Miller completed the course in each of her events with a best finish of tenth in the downhill.|$|E
5|$|When the ice {{finally brought}} the camp {{to the edge}} of the pack ice, Shackleton decided that the three boats, the James Caird, Stancomb Wills, and Dudley <b>Docker,</b> should make {{initially}} for Elephant Island.

Russell <b>Docker,</b> who was paralysed from the waist down following a skiing accident in 1995, appeared at the Paralympics {{for the first time and}} competed in the LW12 classification. He crashed out in the downhill event and failed to complete his other three races. Stephen Napier, who was disabled after being knocked off a motorbike by an unmarked police car in 1995, also competed in four events in the LW10 classification. His highest finish was sixth in the Super-G and he also had three seventh-place finishes. In each of his events Napier was the lowest ranked athlete to complete the course.|$|E

5000|$|A 1996 {{study shows}} that a pair of <b>Dockers</b> pants often had a price range of $50-$80 per pair. A study in 2014 helped compare older prices to more current prices within the <b>Dockers</b> label.

[...] Because of these prices, <b>Dockers</b> {{can be viewed as}} a brand favored by more {{affluent}} households. In 2012, 27.9 percent of respondents who came from a household where the annual income was $200,000 or more stated that they owned <b>Dockers</b> brand apparel, accessories, and footwear.|$|R

50|$|From 1995 the Burnie <b>Dockers</b> were successful, {{making the}} 1996 and 1997 Grand Finals, but {{ultimately}} losing both to Southern powerhouse, Clarence. Shortly after, the <b>Dockers</b> found themselves (like many TFL clubs during the 1990s) in serious financial trouble and facing extinction until a late bailout by the Burnie City Council saved them.

25|$|<b>Docker</b> {{retired as}} a BSA {{director}} in 1912 and installed Lincoln Chandler on the BSA board as his replacement. <b>Docker</b> liked to draw a comparison between the BSA~Daimler merger he engineered {{and that of his}} 1902 merger of Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Company and Patent Shaft. However, there was not the integration of facilities in the BSA~Daimler case, nor was there a reorganisation of either BSA or Daimler. In view of the earlier criticism contained in the 1909 report of the investigation committee, BSA continued to produce cars of their own, using Daimler engines. In 1913, Daimler employed 5,000 workers to manufacture 1,000 vehicles, an indication that things were not well.|$|E
