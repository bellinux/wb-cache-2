500|$|The {{telecast}} {{also received}} unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures. In {{an interview with}} Los Angeles Daily News author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the [...] "Year of the Woman" [...] theme commenting, [...] "It had no basis in reality. On behalf of women directors, cinematographer, and producers, <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> the travesty of calling that a tribute." [...] Likewise, President of the National Organization for Women's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony's feminist tribute as [...] "one of the most hypocritical, patronizing things I saw in my whole life." [...] In response, Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating, [...] "The theme developed and raised consciousness {{in a way that}} I think is positive, not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically." [...] He also quoted an ancient Chinese proverb later made famous by former U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt saying, [...] "It is better to light one candle than to curse the darkness" ...|$|E
500|$|To {{minimize}} her tax liability, Heyer {{formed a}} {{limited liability company}} called Heron Enterprises around 1950. Royalties from new titles would {{be paid to the}} company, which would then furnish Heyer's salary and pay directors' fees to her family. She would continue to receive royalties from her previous titles, and foreign royalties – except for those from the United States – would go to her mother. Within several years, however, a tax inspector found that Heyer was withdrawing too much money from the company. The inspector considered the extra funds as undisclosed dividends, meaning that she owed an additional £3,000 in taxes. To pay the tax bill, Heyer wrote two articles, [...] "Books about the Brontës" [...] and [...] "How to be a Literary Writer", that were published in the magazine Punch. She once wrote to a friend, [...] "I'm getting so tired of writing books {{for the benefit of the}} Treasury and I can't tell you how utterly <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> the squandering of my money on such fatuous things as Education and Making Life Easy and Luxurious for So-Called Workers." ...|$|E
500|$|Borah was not {{personally}} harmed by {{the stock market}} crash of October 1929, having sold any stocks and invested in government bonds. [...] Thousands of Americans had borrowed on margin, and were ruined by the crash. [...] Congress in June 1930 passed the Hawley–Smoot Tariff, [...] sharply increasing rates on imports. [...] Borah was one of 12 Republicans who joined Democrats in opposing the bill, which passed the Senate 44–42. Borah was up for election in 1930, and despite a minimal campaign effort, took over 70percent of the vote in a bad year for Republicans. When he returned to Washington for the lame-duck session of the Senate beginning in December, Borah pressed the passage of legislation that would help business and suggested that members of Congress turn back their salary to the Treasury. The economy continued to worsen in the winter of 1931, and Borah urged relief legislation, stating that opponents argued [...] "that for the Government to feed this woman and her sick children would destroy her self respect and make a bad citizen of her. [...] Does anyone believe it? It is a cowardly imputation on the helpless. [...] <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> it and I repudiate it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had asked}} him the {{question}} inhospitably enough, for <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> the sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face. <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond to it. But I took him into the room I had just left, and, having set the lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could to explain himself.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought of}} Paolo, and Il Duro, and the Signor Pietro, our padrone, and <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> these factory-hands for criticizing them.|$|R
60|$|I didn't believe Jack {{had ever}} said {{anything}} so foolish. Sara imagined things. But <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> the aspersion of blue-stockingness cast on Betty.|$|R
2500|$|The paper [...] "caused an uproar", {{according}} to Pamela McCorduck. The AI community's response was derisive and personal. Seymour Papert dismissed {{one third of}} the paper as [...] "gossip" [...] and claimed that every quotation was deliberately taken out of context. Herbert A. Simon accused Dreyfus of playing [...] "politics" [...] so that he could attach the prestigious RAND name to his ideas. Simon said, [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> about this was the RAND name attached to that garbage".|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, future First Lady Hillary Clinton {{said during}} a 60 Minutes {{interview}} either [...] "I'm not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". or [...] "I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". (The end of this quotation has also appeared as [...] "some little woman, standing by my man and baking cookies, like Tammy Wynette." [...] However, the reference to cookie baking more likely comes from an unrelated remark by Hillary Clinton: [...] "I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided {{to do was to}} fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life.") The remark set off a firestorm of controversy. Wynette wrote to Clinton, saying, [...] "With all that is in me, <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> your caustic remark. I believe you have offended every true country-music fan and every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the White House." [...] Clinton then called to apologize after she saw the large negative reaction she received, and asked Wynette to perform at a fundraiser. Wynette agreed to do so.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{interest}} in your crockery," [...] Norgate announced, [...] "is non-existent. I {{have come to}} hear your offer. I have decided to retire--temporarily, at any rate--from the Diplomatic Service. I understand that I am in disgrace, and <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> it. <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> having had to leave Berlin except at my own choice. I am {{looking for a job}} in some other walk of life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” Aynsley {{answered}} lamely. “Still, I couldn’t go too far. I didn’t {{want him}} to think <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> his interfering. After all, he bought me the mill.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This remark {{helped me}} very much, for <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> it. 'I {{do not see}} what there is to bear,' I said. 'Such a man as Bernard--and then I have special reasons--' ...|$|R
6000|$|He said it so {{exactly in}} the tone in which one tells a waiter he may keep the change, that <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> the impertinence. 'No, thank you,' I answered. 'I do not require it.' ...|$|R
60|$|HILLCRIST. [With dignity] I'm {{not going}} {{in for a}} slanging match. <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> your conduct much too deeply.|$|E
60|$|CAESAR. Resent! O thou foolish Egyptian, {{what have}} I {{to do with}} resentment? Do <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> the wind when it chills me, or the night when it makes me stumble in the darkness? Shall <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> youth when it turns from age, and {{ambition}} when it turns from servitude? To tell me such a story as this is but {{to tell me that}} the sun will rise to-morrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Millicent. [...] "Displeased me! How could <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> {{anything}} you might either say or do? Have I not heaped injury upon you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{was in no}} {{mood for}} joking, for it is not a merry thing to dig like {{anything}} for months and be completely ruined in the process, especially if you happen to dislike digging, and consequently <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> Harry's light-heartedness.|$|R
60|$|A deadly fear of him shook me. I {{did my best}} to {{hide the}} outward {{betrayal}} of it. By look and word, I showed him, as firmly as I could, that <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> the liberty he had taken with me.|$|R
60|$|I seriously {{believe it}} had never once entered my head for a single moment, to {{consider}} whether she was or not. <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> the idea, of course; but I was in a manner struck by it, as a new one altogether.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can countenance no {{discussion}} with such men as that," [...] Griffiths declared scornfully. [...] "I am {{here in the}} execution of my duty, and <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> any interference with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{as much as}} ever," [...] was the {{somewhat}} bitter reply. [...] "That's what <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> so much. I should like Henry {{to believe that he}} had killed every spark of love in me." ...|$|E
60|$|SIR WILLIAM. In {{the whole}} {{course of our}} married life, Dorothy, I've never known you set {{yourself}} up against me. <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> this, I warn you--I resent it. Send the girl to me. I'll do it myself.|$|E
5000|$|The fact of {{the matter}} was that <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> The Book of the Law with my whole soul. For one thing, it knocked my Buddhism {{completely}} on the head. ... I was bitterly opposed to the principles of the Book on almost every point of morality. The third chapter seemed to me gratuitously atrocious.|$|R
5000|$|I {{remember}} feeling ashamed, {{for some}} reason. I {{was ashamed of}} my parents. I couldn't face {{some of my friends}} at school anymore, because I desperately wanted to have the classic, you know, typical family. Mother, father. I wanted that security, so <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> my parents for quite a few years because of that.|$|R
60|$|I was not {{accustomed}} to such rough treatment, and <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> it instantly. <b>I</b> was not very large for my age, but I was strong, and ducking my head I wrenched myself free from his grasp and sprang {{to the other side}} of the small table that stood in the centre of the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "I find myself," [...] he told Jacob, as {{the meal}} was concluded, [...] "in an {{exceedingly}} painful situation. I have never before had to ask a guest to leave my house, and <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> very much the necessity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] said he, [...] "I {{take your}} meaning very fully. Half {{a word with}} me {{is as good as}} a whole {{sentence}} with another. You have dubbed me in polite phrases an impertinent. That I am not; and <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> the imputation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{but you are}} mistaken, M. le Marquis. I have no wish to be offensive. But <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> having hands violently laid upon me, {{especially}} when they are hands that I cannot consider clean, In the circumstances I can hardly {{be expected to be}} polite." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{wrote to}} you, I refused to {{acknowledge}} that any such dreadful discovery as this could be possible; <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> the bare idea {{of it as a}} cruel insult to my friend. Since that time--my face burns with shame while I write it--I am a little, just a little, shaken in my own opinion.|$|R
6000|$|I {{began to}} discern faintly {{that there might}} have been another than a bad motive for his conduct. But--well! I dare say I was wrong; <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> the tone he was taking with me; I would have owned I had made a mistake to anybody else in the world; I wouldn't own it to him. There! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{believe there}} are few young men, and those very sturdy moralists, who would not rather be taxed with some moral peccadillo than with want of {{knowledge}} in horsemanship. As I {{was by no means}} deficient either in skill or courage, <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> my uncle's insinuation accordingly, and assured him he would find me up with the hounds.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't tack the Miss on," [...] I implored. [...] "Call me Cornelia ... {{or better}} still, Nic, as Dad does. I do resent your coming so soon. <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> your coming at all. And, oh, {{it is such}} a {{satisfaction}} to tell you so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Nafferton; [...] "have {{you ever}} been stuck with a horse? It isn't the money I mind, though that is bad enough; but what <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> is the chaff that follows, {{especially}} from the boy who stuck me. But I think we'll cry quite now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “The {{one thing}} <b>I</b> <b>resent</b> {{is that it}} {{apparently}} sets you thinking,” she said. “I can’t be satisfied with less than I offer you, Tony, {{and the man who}} loves me must believe in me implicitly. I did not get angry when you would not share your troubles with me.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Hollywood.com's Michelle Lee said, [...] "Like the Lost fan rejecting every Lost-like {{show that}} came after it, <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> {{all of the}} shaky single-camera docu-style comedies that came after Arrested's demise.

5000|$|Haig {{retired in}} 1992, feeling typecast: [...] "I just didn't {{want to play}} stupid heavies anymore. They just kept giving me the same parts but just putting {{different}} clothes on me. It was stupid, and <b>I</b> <b>resented</b> it, and <b>I</b> wouldn't {{have anything to do}} with it". Haig did not work in acting for five years, instead training and becoming a certified Hypnotherapist.|$|R
60|$|To {{say that}} <b>I</b> had not <b>resented</b> this foul deed, {{which seemed to}} me deserving of {{the title of the}} crime of the century, would be paltering with the truth. <b>I</b> had <b>resented</b> it profoundly, chafing not a little at the time and {{continuing}} to chafe for some weeks.|$|R
