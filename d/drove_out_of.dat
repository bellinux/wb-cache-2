5|$|Caracciola {{was lucky}} to escape from a crash in the Masaryk Grand Prix. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, {{bringing}} it crashing down onto the road. Caracciola and Chiron drove into a ditch {{at the side of}} the road to avoid the debris; while Chiron <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ditch and was able to continue, Caracciola drove into a tree and retired. Despite this accident, Caracciola again performed strongly in the Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight climbs in his SSKL to take the title. Perhaps his most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of Alfa Romeos battled for the lead early in the race, but when they fell back Caracciola was able to take control. His win, in record time, made him and his co-driver Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the full course were Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Kyle Busch {{maintained}} a 1.4 second lead over Kurt Busch by the 249th lap. Three laps later, Keselowski <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his garage {{to rejoin the}} race. By lap 262, drivers reported their cars were sliding in the corners as their tires became worn. Green flag pit stops began on lap 265; Kyle Busch maintained the lead {{at the end of}} the cycle, ahead of Reutimann and Kenseth. On the 290th lap, Kurt Busch's crew reported to him that he was running two laps short of fuel. Six laps later, Kyle Busch started to slow in the corners to conserve fuel. On the 298th lap, Martin dropped one position to run fifth. By the 302nd lap, overall speeds had dropped due to drivers starting to conserve fuel. Green flag pit stops began on lap 311, as Truex made a stop for fuel. Kyle Busch elected not to make a pit stop and increased his lead to four seconds by lap 314. Eight laps later, Kyle Busch was told by his team to reduce his speed. On lap 330, Kyle Busch drove to pit road, having run out of fuel, handing the lead to Kurt Busch. One lap later, Ambrose ran out of fuel, as Kurt Busch held the lead to win his second race of the 2009 season. Hamlin finished second, ahead of Kenseth in third, Martin in fourth, and Harvick in fifth. Stewart, Bowyer, Biffle, Burton and A. J. Allmendinger rounded out the top ten finishers.|$|E
5|$|On 12 June 1918, {{the leader}} of the local secret police, Gavril Myasnikov, with the {{connivance}} of other local Bolsheviks, hatched a plan to murder Michael. Myasnikov assembled a team of four men who, like him, were all former prisoners of the Tsarist regime: Vasily Ivanchenko, Ivan Kolpashchikov, Andrei Markov and Nikolai Zhuzhgov. Using a forged order, the four men gained entry to Michael's hotel at 11.45 p.m. At first, Michael refused to accompany the men until he spoke with the local chairman of the secret police, Pavel Malkov, and then because he was ill. His protestations were futile and he got dressed. Johnson insisted on accompanying him and the four men plus their two prisoners climbed into two horse-drawn three-seater traps. They <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the town into the forest near Motovilikha. When Michael queried their destination, he was told they were going to a remote railway crossing to catch a train. By now it was the early hours of 13 June. They all alighted from the carriages {{in the middle of the}} wood, and both Michael and Johnson were fired upon, once each, but as the assassins were using home-made bullets, their guns jammed. Michael, whether wounded or not is unknown, moved towards the wounded Johnson with arms outstretched, when he was shot at point-blank range in the head. Both Zhuzhgov and Markov claimed to have fired the fatal shot. Johnson was shot dead by Ivanchenko. The bodies were stripped and buried. Anything of value was stolen and the clothes were taken back to Perm. After they were shown to Myasnikov as proof of the murders, the clothes were burned. The Ural Regional Soviet, headed by Alexander Beloborodov, approved the execution, either retrospectively or beforehand, as did Lenin. Michael was the first of the Romanovs to be executed by the Bolsheviks but he was not the last. Neither Michael's nor Johnson's remains have been found.|$|E

500|$|Minogue {{ventured into}} music during her {{time on the}} show and her cover of [...] "The Loco-Motion" [...] spent several weeks {{at the top of the}} Australian music chart. In late 1987, Minogue flew to England to record [...] "I Should Be So Lucky", before {{returning}} home to continue with Neighbours. The press speculated that she would soon have to make a decision between acting and singing. Shortly after, Minogue chose to concentrate on her burgeoning music career and decided to leave Neighbours after two and a half years. She filmed her final scenes in June 1988. Charlene's exit storyline saw her move to Brisbane, after her grandfather, Dan (Syd Conabere), bought her and Scott a house there. Scott was initially unable to go with his wife, so she said goodbye to him, on the understanding that he would join her as soon as he could get a job transfer. All of the cast gathered in the street, while Charlene said goodbye to her brother, mother and friends. She then got into her green Mini and <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Ramsay Street.|$|E
2500|$|Modern printings {{frequently}} incorporate alterations {{that reflect}} changing linguistic and cultural sensibilities. [...] For example, breast in [...] "The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow" [...] is frequently bowdlerized to crest; the [...] in [...] "But I heard him exclaim ere he <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight" [...] is frequently replaced with as. Note that this change implies that Santa Claus made his exclamation during {{the moment that}} he disappeared from view, while the exclamation came before his disappearance in the original. [...] "Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night" [...] is frequently rendered with the traditional English locution [...] "'Merry Christmas'" [...] and with [...] "goodnight" [...] as a single word.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of May 11, 1982, Bulger was told the {{whereabouts}} of a former associate turned Federal informant, Edward Brian Halloran, known on the streets as [...] "Balloonhead". After arriving at the scene, Weeks staked out Anthony's Pier 4 Restaurant, where Halloran and construction worker Michael Donahue were dining together. As Donahue and Halloran <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the parking lot Weeks signaled Bulger by stating, [...] "The balloon is in the air", over a hand held radio. Bulger drove up with a masked man armed with a silenced Mac 10; Bulger himself carried a [...]30 caliber carbine. Bulger and the other shooter opened fire and sprayed Halloran and Donahue's car with bullets. Donahue {{was shot in the}} head and killed instantly. Halloran lived long enough to identify his attacker as James Flynn, a Winter Hill associate, who was later tried and acquitted. Flynn remained the prime suspect until 1999, when Weeks agreed to cooperate with investigators.|$|E

However, the harassment against the party grew to the point that Dingeldey was forced to dissolve the party on July 4 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fear for its remaining members' safety.|$|R

2500|$|Baker-Carr {{formed a}} {{composite}} company from G Battalion, 1st Tank Brigade and held rehearsals {{in which the}} tanks attacked the fortifications from the rear, where they were most vulnerable and the garrisons' lines of the retreat would be blocked. The infantry was to follow in platoons [...] behind each tank, waiting for a shovel waved out of the manhole in the roof as the signal to move up to the strongpoint. The gun pits, Hillock Farm, Vancouver, Triangle Farm, Maison du Hibou and the Cockcroft were to be attacked by one tank each; two more tanks were to attack Winnipeg Cemetery and Springfield, with one floater and four tanks in reserve at California Trench. The infantry of the 1/8th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment (1/8th Warwick) of the 143rd Brigade, 48th Division, were to occupy the strong points once the tanks signalled that the defenders had been silenced. The smoke barrage was due to begin on 19 August at [...] as the tanks <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> St Julien up the St Julienâ€“Poelcappelle road followed by the 1/8th Warwick. The advance was to be shrouded by a smoke barrage and aircraft flying low to disguise {{the sound of the}} tanks.|$|E
2500|$|The 143rd and 144th brigades of the 48th Division were {{to attack}} with an advance guard of tanks {{followed}} by a thin wave of infantry, to mop up German positions and capture the St Julienâ€“Polcappelle road. On the right flank, a protective barrage began at [...] and ten tanks <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> St Julien. Six tanks advanced eastwards up the road to Winnipeg followed by the 1/5th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment (1/5th Warwick) but the tanks were knocked out or bogged at Janet Farm. Four tanks drove along the St Julienâ€“Polcappelle road and enabled the 1/5th Warwick to capture the Springfield strongpoint (recaptured in a German counter-attack). The infantry attacked the gun pits and captured Winnipeg further on, lost Winnipeg to a counter-attack then recaptured it but the German artillery and machine-guns prevented the British infantry in support from getting forward to reinforce the attacking troops. On the left flank the 1/6th Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment (1/6th Gloucester) of the 144th Brigade managed to advance close to the Zonnebekeâ€“Langemarck road {{in touch with the}} 1/5th Warwick and the tanks on the St Julienâ€“Polcappelle road attacked Vancouver, which was captured at [...] then recaptured. The division had managed to get about half-way to the objective and during the night, outposts were pushed forward closer to the St Julienâ€“Polcappelle road.|$|E
2500|$|Only seven {{tanks of}} the {{composite}} company, one male and six female, were operational when the operation began at [...] the others having already broken down or bogged. The tanks <b>drove</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> St Julien {{one at a}} time towards Hillock Farm, about [...] up the road, which took until [...] the farm was empty and occupied by the 1/8th Warwick. Tank G. 29 (Second-Lieutenant A. G. Barker) reached the road junction at Triangle Farm but could not turn left down the road for Maison du Hibou as it had been obliterated. G. 29 was driven another [...] along the Poelcappelle road, which brought the tank {{to the rear of the}} strongpoint. The crew tried to approach cross-country and at , opened fire with the 6-pounder in the left sponson. After firing forty times, about sixty Germans fled from Maison du Hibou, half being shot down and the remainder taken prisoner by the 1/8th Warwick. From the road, the crew of tank G. 31 engaged the blockhouse with its Lewis guns but then returned to the rally-point with engine trouble. G. 29 bogged down but was able to engage the Germans in the Wilhemstellung with the gun in the right sponson, until the tank sank too far into the mud to bring the gun to bear and around [...] the crew disabled the 6-pounders, dismounted the Lewis guns and handed them to the 1/8th Warwick.|$|E
