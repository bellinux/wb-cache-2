5|$|There {{was little}} {{in way of}} work {{opportunities}} for Heaphy in Nelson and he based himself in Motueka. Here he farmed land with a friend, Frederick Moore and this took much of what little funds he had. His farming venture was hard work and not particularly successful. By late 1843, the New Zealand Company {{was in need of}} good pastoral land around Nelson. It had clashed with Māori in the Wairau Affray in the Wairau Valley, to the south-east of Nelson and several company employees, including Arthur Wakefield, were killed. The company needed to scout the area to the south-west and Heaphy <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> chance to explore.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Plummer <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> Broncos moving by {{completing}} four consecutive passes for 80 yards, {{the last one}} a 30-yard touchdown pass to Ashley Lelie. But Wilson caught two passes for 45 yards on Pittsburgh's next possession, setting up Reed's second field goal to make the score 27–10.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s, the Yugoslav {{national}} team {{had always been}} a contender, but never quite managed to make the final step. It was in the 1968 Olympics that the generation led by Mirko Sandić and Ozren Bonačić <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> gold, beating Soviet Union after extra time. The country won two more Olympic golds – in 1984 and 1988.|$|E

25|$|On 17 January 1943 Captain Naude left Windhoek leading an {{overland}} convoy {{to recover}} the Ventura. After on-site repairs and a four-day digging effort, he <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> plane airborne on 29 January. However, after only 43 minutes' flying time the aircraft developed engine trouble and ditched in the sea about 200 yards offshore near Rocky Point. Naude and his two fellow aircrew survived the crash and managed to swim ashore. Their returning land convoy rescued them on 1 February.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} {{loss of the}} season, Tottenham then had the {{challenge}} of Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, and although Spurs stayed in the game for long periods, they eventually succumbed to a 3–0 defeat. Tottenham {{had the chance to}} immediately bounce back in the League Cup facing Championship side Preston North End. The game played out on even footing with Preston giving as good as they got in the early stage until Tottenham <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> breakthrough and ended the game with a 5–1 victory with Peter Crouch scoring a hat-trick in the process.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Blue Bombers <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> on <b>the</b> {{scoreboard}} late in {{the first}} half on Michael Richardson’s three-yard run. Both teams exchanged field goals as Edmonton held a 24-10 lead at halftime.|$|R

25|$|Midway {{through the}} second quarter, White, who had been held to {{negative}} passing yardage, <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> Cowboys going on a 10-play, 68-yard drive, completing an 18-yard screen pass to Tony Dorsett and a 12-yarder to Drew Pearson before Dorsett wrapped {{it up with a}} 3-yard touchdown run to tie the game. The score would remain 7–7 at halftime, due to another blown scoring chance by the Eagles when Jaworski's touchdown pass to Harold Carmichael was canceled out by a 15-yard personal foul penalty on guard Woody Peoples.|$|E
25|$|Kakinandivada, {{a village}} near the present Kakinada was a Dutch settlement. They {{also used to}} store and export Coconut {{products}} and, hence, the name Co–canada. The British East India Company also called it with the same name when they established the first Canadian Baptist Mission. After Independence, it <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> name Kakinada. Some theories suggest Kakasura's losing his eye by an arrow of Lord Rama gave the name Kakinada or that Kakinandi vada is derived from Kaka, an Ikshvaku king, who built the town. Another theory {{says that it is}} Kakulavada, an abode of crows – for catching fish on the shore.|$|E
25|$|After {{being unable}} to beat the Fantastics on several occasions, the Sheepherders {{traveled}} back to Puerto Rico during the summer for a six-week run with the WWC World Tag Team Championship on August3. When their short run with WWC ended, Luke and Butch sought new challenges and traveled to Florida where they worked for Championship Wrestling from Florida. In Florida the Sheepherders came across their old arch enemies the Fabulous Ones, instantly rekindling their violent feud.

25|$|On that occasion, Reles dragged Irving {{from the}} hallway of his home out into the street. Reles beat, kicked, and then shot Irving {{numerous}} times, killing him. Two months later, Reles met Meyer Shapiro {{on the street and}} killed him by shooting him in the face. Another three years elapsed before Reles <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> last Shapiro brother, William. William was abducted off the street and taken to a gang hideout. Once there, he was beaten nearly to death, stuffed into a sack, and driven out to the Canarsie section of Brooklyn and buried. Before the gang could finish burying William, a passerby spotted them and they had to flee the scene. William Shapiro's body was exhumed shortly thereafter, and after being autopsied it was determined that he had been buried alive.|$|E
25|$|Lee bowled 17 overs, and conceded 111 runs, but got the one wicket of Pietersen, {{who pulled}} to Simon Katich for 71 off 76 balls, {{and with the}} score on 342 for 7 with 24 {{scheduled}} overs remaining in the day. Then, Steve Harmison smacked two fours and a six in a 15-minute 17, and Simon Jones stuck around with Matthew Hoggard for a last-wicket partnership of 32, Jones making 19 not out. Shane Warne <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> better of Hoggard, to end with four for 116, {{but by that time}} England had gone past 400 and ended up with a total of 407 in just under 80 overs. Just as Australia's opening batsman walked out and prepared for their innings, the rain began to fall on Edgbaston, and play had to be stopped.|$|E

25|$|Lee did get one wicket, though, and Australia {{could have}} been forgiven for {{thinking}} {{it was the most}} important. Pietersen pulled to Simon Katich for 71, off just 76 balls, and with the score on 342 for 7, England would have to get something extraordinary out of the tail to get past 400. But they did – Steve Harmison smacked two fours and a six in an entertaining, if brief, 17, and Simon Jones stuck around with Matthew Hoggard for a vital last-wicket partnership of 32, Jones making 19 not out. Shane Warne <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> better of Hoggard, but England had made 407, in just under 80 overs. The Australian openers took to the field for the last half-hour of the day. However, heavy rain prevented another ball being bowled on the first day.|$|E
25|$|Mosby <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> Department of Justice post {{he wanted}} as Philander Knox ended his term as {{attorney}} general. It {{was not with}} the trust-busting unit, however, but with the Bureau of Insular and Territorial affairs, where Mosby worked (at a low salary of $2,400/year) under his brother-in-law Charles W. Russell from 1904 to 1910. In 1905 President Roosevelt again sent him to Alabama to troubleshoot allegations of irregularities at the Port of Mobile. Next, {{he was sent to}} Oklahoma to investigate charges against U.S. Marshall (and former Rough Rider) Benjamin Colbert. He also secured an indictment of McAlester attorneys George Mansfield, John F. McMurray and Melvin Cornish for misappropriation of Indian Trust funds, but his superior Russell thought the evidence insufficient and ultimately dropped the charges two years later. Meanwhile, Mosby went back to investigate charges of land frauds against Indian minors, and on his return found little to do.|$|E
25|$|In ancient China, {{women were}} under-appreciated. This opinion was {{deeply rooted in}} the mind of Lanying’s family. Compared with her little sisters, she was quite lucky because she was the first baby. All of her sisters were sent to be child brides or killed. She was often mistreated and was not allowed to get an education. Before she was 6 years old, Lanying was {{required}} to wash all the clothes and cook for whole family. At age of six, she wanted to go to school because she wanted to escape the traditional pattern for women at her time, which was doing housework and chatting with other women all day. The only way to do was to get an education. However, her mother, who was deeply influenced by gender schema from society and controlled her life, did not allow that. So Lanying locked herself in her room and swore that she would not eat if she was not allowed to go to school. Her mother was moved by her insistence, so she <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> chance to get an education.|$|E

25|$|England {{managed to}} push {{on with the}} job of {{restoring}} some pride to their innings {{on the morning of}} the fifth day, thanks largely to the heroics of Jack Russell. From his overnight 47 not out, Russell soon pushed past fifty, and his partner Emburey looked as though he wasn't going to surrender his wicket easily either. They batted throughout the morning adding to their overnight partnership of 64. Russell looked confident, and it seemed Australia's bowlers were lost for ideas on how to remove the pair. The looked as though they were willing to bat the day out and save the match. They soon took England past Australia's total, and set about building a lead, but with less than a days play remaining, an English victory looked out of the question. Emburey brought up his fifty, his first of the series. The pair looked to be quite comfortable, however soon after they had taken England past 200, Australia <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> breakthrough they had sought. Alderman produced a brilliant outswinger which cut off the pitch, collecting the top of Emburey's off-stump, clean bowled for a well made 64.|$|E
25|$|Captain Pearson of Serapis {{had only}} limited {{knowledge}} of the escalating chaos aboard Bonhomme Richard. He too was losing many men from Alliance’s attacks, {{and he could not}} move his ship. Alliance, still effectively undamaged, could keep firing at will. On the other hand, nearly every ship in the convoy he had been sent to protect had reached safety before the battle even began. Following the second of Alliance’s new round of broadsides, like Piercy before him, he decided that he could achieve nothing more by continuing to fight. Not long after 10:30pm, he called for quarter and struck his colours in person. Thus the Americans <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> <b>the</b> chance to board the Serapis, but this did not go quite as well as it could have. Three shots were fired by British sailors who had not got the message. Midshipman John Mayrant, following First Lieutenant Dale aboard, got a pike stuck through his leg. Pearson’s first lieutenant was among those reluctant to believe that his captain had surrendered, and Dale made sure that he stayed with Pearson rather than leaving him to his own devices. A short time later, as Captain Pearson was boarding Bonhomme Richard to hand over his ceremonial sword, the main-mast of Serapis finally fell overboard, perhaps as a result of work to separate the two ships, dragging the damaged mizzen-top-mast with it. As Bonhomme Richard got under way, Dale attempted to follow in Serapis, and learned two important facts in quick succession. First, Serapis would not move, and second, he had a very large splinter in his leg, which now caused him to fall over. The first problem was rectified by cutting the anchor cable, the second by returning Dale to Bonhomme Richard for treatment. Boats from both Serapis and Alliance were used to begin the evacuation of Bonhomme Richard’s crew. One or two of these boats went missing during the night, as ex-captive British crewmen took the opportunity to go home (hence the eyewitness newspaper stories). The combatants, although they probably cared little, had been observed by thousands of onlookers, for on that clear night, with a near-full moon, the action could be seen from a long stretch of the high Yorkshire coastline, from Scarborough in the north to Flamborough Head itself in the south.|$|E

50|$|The {{second half}} was largely uneventful.
