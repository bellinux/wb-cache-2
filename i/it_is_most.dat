In North America, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>most</b> common west of the Mississippi River; Ravenel's stinkhorn (Phallus ravenelii) is more common to the east. The fungus is associated with rotting wood, and as such <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>most</b> commonly encountered in deciduous woods where it fruits from summer to late autumn, though it may also be found in conifer woods or even grassy areas such as parks and gardens. It may also form mycorrhizal associations with certain trees.|$|E

Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.|$|E

The number of cases has been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population.|$|E
