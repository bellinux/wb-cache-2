In autumn and winter, {{the diet}} is supplemented with nuts and seeds, hazel nuts and beech mast being preferred. The young are fed {{mainly on the}} insects favoured by their parents, with some seeds. Food items are found mainly on tree trunks and large branches, but smaller branches may also be investigated, and food may be taken from the ground, especially outside the breeding season. Nuthatches can forage when descending trees head first, as well as when climbing. Some prey is caught in flight, and a nuthatch will remove bark or rotten wood to reach insects, although it cannot chisel into healthy wood like a woodpecker. A pair may temporarily join a mixed-species foraging flock as it passes near their territory. The Eurasian nuthatch readily visits bird tables and bird feeders in winter, eating human-made food items such as <b>fat,</b> <b>cheese,</b> butter and bread. It has even been recorded as taking slaughterhouse offal. Sizeable hard food items like nuts or large insects are wedged into crevices in tree bark and smashed with the strong bill.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} {{procedure of}} low <b>fat</b> <b>cheeses</b> produced from ultrafiltered milk (UF cheese) {{was developed in}} this study. The production procedure, that includes utilization of UF milk with 2 % of lactose, addition of 1. 5 % inulin and salting with 2 % of mixed salt (NaCl/KCl in ratio 3 : 1) was defined based on the investigation that included the influence of coagulation parameters, different lactose content of UF milk, different inulin content, and different salt type and content on the properties of low <b>fat</b> UF <b>cheeses.</b> Presented production procedure enables {{the production of a}} product with satisfactory dietetic and functional properties. Reduced lactose content of UF milk contributes to stabilisation of pH value at an adequate level and achievement of acceptable texture properties of low <b>fat</b> UF <b>cheeses.</b> Defined inulin content (1. 5 %) improved cheese texture, as well as its functional properties, enabling the cheese produced to be marked as a “good source of fibre”. Reduced sodium content, due to partial substitution of NaCl with KCl, also contributes to the improvement of dietetic properties of <b>cheeses.</b> Low <b>fat</b> UF <b>cheeses,</b> produced according to defined production procedure, were analysed during 8 weeks of ripening and storage periods.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of extrusion technology and fat replacers to produce high protein, low fat Cheddar cheese. In chapter 3, four different fat replacers were tested at the highest concentration level of each, as recommended by the manufacturers for low <b>fat</b> <b>cheese,</b> to investigate the change in cheese texture and optimize extruder conditions. In addition, the press time/pressure combinations of the extruded cheeses were optimized. The fat replacers and extruder conditions that were effective in improving the texture of low <b>fat</b> <b>cheese</b> were then used in chapter 4. In chapter 4, three fat replacers were used at three different concentrations (lowest, middle and highest) as recommended by the manufacturers for replacing fat in cheese. The fat replacers were microcrystalline cellulose (MCC 1) (0. 125 %, 1. 06 % and 2 %), whey protein concentrate (WPC 2) (0. 50 %, 0. 75 % and 1 %) and whey protein concentrate (WPC 1) (0. 40 %, 2. 20 % and 4 %). These fat replacers were effective in improving the texture of low <b>fat</b> <b>cheese</b> as determined {{from the results of}} chapter 3. The extruded cheese samples with and without fat replacers were analyzed for texture at three different time periods (1 day, 1 week, and 1 month). None of the fat replacers used were effective in improving the texture of low <b>fat</b> <b>cheese</b> significantly. Since none of the treatments statistically improved the texture of low <b>fat</b> <b>cheese,</b> in the next part of the study, extrusion alone and WPC 1 at the middle concentration were then used to produce low <b>fat</b> <b>cheese</b> with high protein content by blending low moisture aged Cheddar cheese and nonfat cheese. Extrusion of cheese blends with or without fat replacer yielded cheese with high protein level. It was concluded from the study that the fat replacers we used were not effective in improving the texture but extrusion of aged Cheddar cheese with nonfat cheese can yield high protein cheese...|$|E
40|$|This paper shows {{results of}} {{organoleptic}} properties, physical-chemical composition and microbiological quality investigation of domestic fresh cheese samples taken from Bjelovar market (Croatia). The results {{were compared to}} research results obtained from other markets, published by other authors. The main characteristic is great variability that results in unequal quality. Weights of different samples ranged from 610 g to 830 g, with mean value 757. 58 g. Cheese consistency shows even greater difference in variety ranging from soft fragmented (28. 57 %) to firm fragmented (7. 14 %). Odour was mostly pleasant and characteristic (71. 43 %) and taste pleasant, slightly acidic, pure only in 57. 14 % of samples. The most common failure in soft cheese organoleptic properties is noticed yeasty odour and taste. Mean value of dry matter was 23. 42 g/ 100 g, and 25. 29 g/ 100 g of fat in dry matter. Acidity of fresh cheese was in pH range from 4. 45 to 3. 81. Due to the <b>fat</b> content, fresh <b>cheese</b> from Bjelovar is a semi <b>fat</b> fresh <b>cheese,</b> while soft cheeses from researches of other authors are described as low <b>fat</b> <b>cheeses</b> (Pravilnik, 2007). Correlation factor for different characteristics was high. Microbiological analyses show that E. coli was in higher amounts than allowed in 3 of 14 samples, and S. aureus in 2 samples.

Low fat cheeses (less than 3 g fat/ 50 g of cheese) suffer from texture defects not apparent in full <b>fat</b> <b>cheese.</b> Polysaccharides {{have been added}} to reduced fat cheeses with the goal of replacing the properties fat provides. The goal of this research is to evaluate the incorporation of polysaccharides as a filler gel into the cream portion of cheese milk used to make low-fat Cheddar cheese as a way to improve the texture of the cheese by mimicking the gel-filling property of fat. Five different hydrocolloids were evaluated for incorporation into a filler gel that was added to the cream required to make a 0. 5 % <b>fat</b> <b>cheese</b> milk, a portion of the skim milk and homogenized. Hydrocolloids evaluated were alginate, xanthan gum pectin, carrageen and Novagel RCN 15 (microcrystalline cellulose and guar gum). The hydrocolloids were mixed with water and a whey protein concentrate (Avonlac 180) that contains a high level of milk fat globule membrane on a high shear mixer. The gel was mixed with the total amount of cream, and an amount of skim which created a blend that was 20 % of the total cheese milk. This blend was homogenized on a two-stage Niro Panda homogenizer at 160 bar (1 st: stage 110 bar; 2 nd stage: 50 bar). Cheese was made in 10 Kg lab scale batches using a modified low-fat Cheddar stirred curd procedure with pre-acidification of the cheese milk to pH 6. 2. Cheese was pressed in small Wilson-style hoops with 40 pounds of pressure. The cheese was evaluated by instructing untrained panelists to place coded samples of cheese (which also contained low and full-fat control) on an unanchored 24 x 24 inch sheet of paper, spatially relative to each other based on flavor and texture differences. All samples were analyzed on a TAXT-Plus Texture analyzer by texture profile analysis. Novagel and Pectin containing samples most approximated the texture of full-fat Cheddar and were selected for pilot scale processing. Cheese was then made in 1200 pounds batches using the procedure described. Samples were analyzed throughout aging for texture, proteolysis, and organic acids. Descriptive sensory analysis and microscopic evaluation by confocal scanning laser microscopy were conducted at the end of shelf-life. Low <b>fat</b> <b>cheese</b> treated with Novagel and Pectin did not show differences in descriptive sensory analysis. There were no differences in firmness score analyzed by TPA between the treatments however; low <b>fat</b> <b>cheese</b> containing whey protein concentrate had more resilient, gummy and chewy texture. None of the treatments showed any differences in age related proteolysis compared to low <b>fat</b> <b>cheese</b> and full <b>fat</b> <b>cheese.</b> All low fat cheeses were found different (P< 0. 05) in organic acids content compared to full <b>fat</b> <b>cheese.</b> Pectin treated cheeses had the highest level of lactic acid and Novagel treated cheese had the highest formic acid. Microstructural examination through confocal microscopy indicated that pectin and Novagel were most likely retained in the treatment cheeses.

40|$|Fatty acids are {{important}} as constituents of cheese flavour. In cheese made from raw milk, milk lipase probably hydrolyses <b>cheese</b> <b>fat</b> to some extent, but cheese made from aseptically drawn milk shows no piquant flavour. It was established that during ripening no active lipase was formed inside the cheese. Enzymes of isolated strains of Lactobacillus and Micrococcus, genera normally found in ripened cheese, failed to hydrolyse fat to a measurable extent in normal conditions for hard cheese. Bacteria from the genera Pseudomonas Achromobacter, Alcaligenes and Serratia, {{belonging to the}} normal flora of milk, caused considerable <b>fat</b> hydrolysis in <b>cheese,</b> although these bacteria did not grow in cheese, and died within a few days. Micro-organisms growing {{on the surface of}} hard cheese could hydrolyse the <b>fat</b> of the <b>cheese</b> rind. As the fat-splitting bacteria are killed by pasteurization of the milk, cheese from pasteurized milk shows no piquant flavour. Addition of suitable amounts of cultures of fat-hydrolysing bacteria to pasteurized milk improved the cheese flavour. The acidity of <b>cheese</b> <b>fat</b> was a useful estimate for the lower free fatty acids as they constituted a standard proportion of total fatty acids. <p/...|$|R

The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of both sheep diet structure (pasture vs. pasture supplemented with food concentrate and hay), and saponified fat supplement (sunflower oil) in the diet, on the fatty acids (FA) profile in the <b>cheese</b> <b>fat</b> (cottage <b>cheese</b> and pressed cheese). 68 Tzurcana sheep were divided into 4 homogeneous groups (17 sheep/group) which were subsequently randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 diets tested: P: grazing with no supplement, PC: grazing and supplementing the diet with 400 g concentrate/day; PCF: PC ratio supplemented with 0. 5 kg meadow hay; PCFG: PCF ratio supplemented with 80 g/day saponified fat (4 % of DM-saponified sunflower oil). Since no significant differences were found regarding milk’s fatty acid profile, between the PC and PCF sheep lots, the milk provided by the two groups was processed and analyzed as control sample. Supplementing grazing sheep diet with concentrate or concentrate plus meadow hay, even if it resulted in increased milk production it had a negative effect on nutritional quality of <b>cheese</b> <b>fat</b> obtained by processing milk. Thus, as compared with the control group where the diet was made up only of pasture, in the case of fat in dairy products there has been a significant increase of saturated fatty acids (SFA) share and a decreased content in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).
