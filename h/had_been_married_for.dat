5|$|Headley states {{he gained}} {{approval}} to sell old Scientology materials on eBay to recoup {{money for the}} organization – he was later accused of embezzlement for doing this.

5|$|In 1871, Goss {{resigned}} as organist of St Paul's Cathedral and Stainer {{was appointed to}} the position early in 1872 at a salary of £400 per annum. By this time he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>married</b> <b>for</b> seven years and had five children with another due shortly. The organ {{was in the process of}} being rebuilt, by the organ builder Henry Willis to Stainer's design, with portions on either side of the entrance to the choir stalls. Around this time he was asked to help revise Hymns Ancient and Modern, a task he did with enthusiasm. At St Paul's, he soon set about reinvigorating the choir. The appointment of vicars choral was for life, and the tenor and bass voices saw no need for rehearsal, meaning that the repertoire was static. Stainer was able to change their attitude, and new anthems and liturgies were introduced, a choir school built, and the number of choristers increased from twelve to thirty-five. When William Sparrow Simpson was appointed Succentor, the raising of standards continued, and St Paul's Cathedral became the focus of religious ceremony in the capital, including state occasions, ceremonial events, memorial services and the funerals of the great and famous. A peal of twelve bells was installed in 1878.|$|E
