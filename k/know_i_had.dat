500|$|The lyrical themes on Dig Me Out {{deal with}} issues of heartbreak and survival. The song [...] "One More Hour" [...] is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship. Before {{the release of the}} album, Spin {{published}} a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission. Brownstein felt that [...] "it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I were going out. They didn't <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever dated a woman before. It was horrible. I was pissed at Spin, really mad. Luckily my parents are great people, but God forbid I would have some family that would disown me over something like that. And I would have totally held Spin responsible for that." [...] The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of Addicted to Noise noted that [...] "one can almost hear Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation". In her 2015 memoir Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl, Brownstein also states that almost all the songs on Dig Me Out are about either her or Tucker's future husband, Lance Bangs.|$|E
500|$|Bassist Jeff Ament {{wrote the}} lyrics for two {{songs on the}} album ("Gods' Dice" [...] and [...] "Nothing as It Seems"), and Gossard for three ("Thin Air," [...] "Of the Girl" [...] and [...] "Rival"). The album is lyrically darker than the band's {{previous}} album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as [...] "pretty somber." [...] Vedder addressed the social criticism contained in the album's lyrics by stating, [...] "I think what everyone's looking for, y'know, is freedom...That's part of being comfortable in your own skin. I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a problem with being told what to do, and {{had a problem with}} being mentally and physically constricted. All of humanity is searching for freedom and I think it's important to know when you have it, too." [...] Ament stated that [...] "Gods' Dice" [...] is about [...] "judging anybody who has any sort of belief system whether they believe in God or not", and that [...] "Nothing as It Seems" [...] is about his childhood growing up in a rural area of Northern Montana. Vedder called [...] "Evacuation" [...] a [...] "song about change", and stated in an interview that the moral of [...] "Insignificance" [...] is [...] "the ineffectiveness of political struggle." [...] Vedder took inspiration from the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle when writing [...] "Grievance", and said the song is about the dangers of technology. Gossard has said that the song [...] "Rival" [...] is his reflection upon the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.|$|E
500|$|Hirst {{gave the}} {{impression}} of enjoying every game he played, and many of the captains under whom he played praised both his personality and his contribution to the team. Lord Hawke said that Hirst's smile [...] "went right round his head and met at the back." [...] Warner noted his wit helped the team in difficult situations during the tour of Australia in 1903–04. Hirst's Times obituary said: [...] "No why or wherefore, no explanation of his great ability, not even his record which adorns the pages of Wisden can adequately describe to those who had not the fortune to see him play the rich quality of George Hirst, the type of professional cricketer to which all would like to aspire. He played during the golden age of cricket, {{and he was one of}} the most illustrious of his time." [...] Hirst was noted for his honesty, sportsmanship, and enthusiasm. Known as [...] "George Herbert", he was admired and affectionately regarded by his contemporaries and by spectators. The public worshipped him in a way never replicated for his contemporary and fellow Kirkheaton-born all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes, a much more dour character. The two men were never good friends; there may have been [...] a degree of jealousy between them, and Rhodes did not appreciate Hirst's jovial attitude. Rhodes was more tactically astute than Hirst, but Hirst's enthusiasm and personality were more inspirational to the team. Rhodes, when asked about Hirst's ability to swing the ball, replied: [...] "He was very good. But he didn't know how to use it, you <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to set the field for him so that he got the best out of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Redwood smote these pretences aside. His {{voice was}} no longer {{coloured}} by fear, but by anger. [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not heard. You <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> heard nothing." ...|$|R

500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rap-Up in March 2010, Minaj revealed the title to the song, and Garrett later hinted around details around his single with Minaj, stating, [...] "I just did Nicki’s first single featuring me. It’s gonna be a fucking bomb. It’s very, very explosive! It’s a club banger. It’s a lot broader than what people would expect her to come with. The record puts her in the game {{in a way that}} says she should’ve been here a long time ago. She has a real way of how she wants to do this. It’s just gonna be a surprise when it comes. She just wants to make it as huge as possible." [...] Additionally, co-producer Alex da Kid said, [...] "I started on the train and finished in the studio. I knew it was special from the start. It wasn't like I was aiming for Nicki with this track; I had a idea I thought was crazy. Nicki heard it and the rest was history." [...] In {{an interview}} with MTV News, Minaj stated when she first heard the song she felt she was in Africa {{and fell in love with}} the drum beats, and commented, [...] "It's a very rare. ... You're not gonna get the song the first time you hear it. After the second or third time, you're gonna be like, 'Whoa, what is this?' It sounds nothing like anything that's out right now." [...] She also called the song [...] "next-level futuristic", and said that she chose Garrett for the song in that he would be the best to [...] "illustrate Nicki Minaj", as he got her and her personality". In an interview on the set of the video shoot for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said, [...] "I'm excited for people to hear me ... doing more than one verse. It's really creative. I wanted to be theatrical, but I am very serous about what I do." [...] Also on the set of the video, Garrett said, [...] "We wanted to give her something that was global," [...] he continued. [...] "We wanted to give her something that was urban; we wanted to give her something that was mainstream pop, you know what I mean, that the world could get a chance to see her out on this pedestal. And of course, you <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to come along with her, because I've got an album dropping soon." [...] The song made its debut March 29, 2010 on WQHT. The song leaked onto the Internet on March 30, 2010, the day before its music video premiere on 106 & Park. The single's art cover was revealed on April 1, 2010, featuring a still of Minaj in the music video as a ninja and comic book font designs. Alex da Kid said that a lot of artists wanted the beat such as Jamie Foxx and Young Jeezy but he gave it to Nicki because it fit her [...] "quirky, left-field vibe." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2008 {{report on}} famine in Ethiopia, {{reporter}} Andrew Geoghegan, from Australian TV programme Foreign Correspondent, visited his 14-year-old sponsor child. The girl has [...] "been {{part of a}} World Vision program all her life" [...] yet says (in translated subtitle) [...] "Until recently, I didn't <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a sponsor." [...] and when asked about her knowledge of World Vision sponsorship says [...] "Last time they gave me this jacket and a pen." [...] Geoghegan was disconcerted to find that despite being [...] "told by World Vision that [...] was learning English at school, and was improving...she speaks no English at all".|$|E
2500|$|Widman {{described}} the run {{after the game}} as follows:"The play was a revolving wedge on Chicago's left tackle. [...] Their end and tackle had been drawn in by our men, and when the ball {{was given to me}} on a delayed pass I had a clear field, except for Chicago's backs. [...] I ran as fast as I could diagonally across the field, realizing that I was hotly pursued. [...] At last I was tackled on what I afterwards learned was about the six-yard line. [...] I was slightly dazed by the fall, but saw a goal post ahead of me and managed to crawl over the line. [...] I did not <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made a touchdown, however, until Captain Bennett told me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on August 8, 2006. Cassie made television appearances on MTV's Total Request Live and BET's 106 & Park to support the album on its release week. Her first televised performances were described as [...] "rocky" [...] and [...] "less-than-stellar," [...] but Diddy {{said that it was}} due to her inexperience, continuing that he would be [...] "with her through her development," [...] and has no [...] "question on her ability [...]" [...] Cassie later added: [...] "I don’t think I should have done those shows. But I didn't <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a choice. I would sit in rehearsals and sing full songs a cappella. I wasn't Beyoncé, but I wasn't fucking up. Then I got out there and was like, 'Oh my God, millions of people are watching me right now. I have stage fright.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|ERICKSON: You <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{one patient}} this last July who had {{four or five}} years of {{psychoanalysis}} and got nowhere with it. And someone who knows her said, [...] "How much attention did you give to the past?" [...] I said, [...] "You know, I completely forgot about that." [...] That patient is, I think, a reasonably cured person. It was a severe washing compulsion, as much as twenty hours a day. I didn't go in to the cause or the etiology; the only searching question I asked was [...] "When you get in the shower to scrub yourself for hours, tell me, do you start {{at the top of your}} head, or the soles of your feet, or in the middle? Do you wash from the neck down, or do you start with your feet and wash up? Or do you start with your head and wash down?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} re-released internationally on the tenth anniversary of Fellini's death in 2003. For the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle noted that I Vitelloni was [...] "a film of sensitivity, {{observation}} and humor – a must-see for Fellini enthusiasts and a worthwhile investment for everyone else. Those less {{taken by the}} maestro may find I Vitelloni to be a favorite among his works". Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune wrote: [...] "In Italy, it remains one of Fellini's most consistently loved movies. It should be in America as well... If you still remember that terrific drunk scene, Alberto Sordi's pre-Some Like It Hot drag tango or the way the little boy balances on the train track at the end, {{you should know that}} this picture plays as strongly now as it did in 1956 or whenever you first saw it. I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a ball watching I Vitelloni again. It reminded me of the old gang." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} month of the season, Schmeichel was shown a {{seemingly}} needless red card in the 79th minute of Leicester's away game to Nottingham Forest on 20 August 2011 after receiving two yellow cards for [...] "unsporting conduct". He received the first card for moving the ball from the penalty spot as Forest's Lewis McGugan was about to take a kick, then received his second for throwing the ball away after the spot kick was successfully converted. After the match, Schmeichel apologized, claiming his back was turned to the referee so did not know he had received the first of the yellow cards. [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been booked as I had my back to the ref otherwise I would never have done that," [...] he said on his personal Twitter page. Despite this, Schmeichel's performances for Leicester quickly began earning him plaudits, with his then manager Sven-Göran Eriksson comparing him with England number 1 goalkeeper Joe Hart, and teammate and former England international Paul Konchesky describing him as [...] "one of the best [...] he has ever played with". [...] A short-distant reaction save against Portsmouth in November 2011, in particular, earnt Schmeichel praise and was described by Portsmouth manager Michael Appleton as [...] "one of the best saves I have seen in a very long time". and by Leicester manager Nigel Pearson as [...] "a world-class, outstanding save and was very important at that point of the game".|$|E

2500|$|Porter {{began his}} {{engineering}} career in 1954 at WLAC-TV in Nashville, Tennessee, where {{he wished to}} be a cameraman—nobody wanted to mix sound, though, and that job was assigned to him, {{the guy with the}} least seniority. He mixed up to four microphones for television broadcast for $92 per week, equivalent to $ today. At nearby RCA Records in 1959, the chief engineer was transferred after angering Chet Atkins, and Porter applied for the position. He was told by an RCA executive from New York that the job would ruin his marriage, but Porter said [...] "I can handle that"—he was hired at $148 per week, and given two weeks to learn all the equipment and how to mix up to 12 microphones for music recordings. Shortly after starting with RCA on March 31, 1959, Porter mixed the single [...] "Lonesome Old House" [...] for Don Gibson; it was a crossover success in both the country music and the pop music charts, and Porter began to be requested by name. In June 1959, he mixed [...] "The Three Bells" [...] for the Browns, with Atkins producing and Anita Kerr arranging. While editing the master to be sent to New York for pressing, Porter accidentally hit the wrong controls on the tape recorder and stretched the tape {{at the beginning of the}} song, distorting the pitch. Without telling anyone, he spliced a different take with a good intro onto the beginning, and sent that version instead. Four decades later, Porter recalled his quick fix: [...] "this was a need-to-know situation and I figured nobody needed to <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been in the business three months or something like that. You're not a good engineer until you destroy a master and hopefully live to talk about it." [...] In July, the song went to number one on the U.S. country and pop charts, and Porter's reputation rose.|$|E
