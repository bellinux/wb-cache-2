Locked grooves are not uncommon and were even heard occasionally in radio broadcasts.|$|E
50|$|Infrared {{cleaning}} is {{a technique}} used to remove the effects of <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> on images scanned from film; many modern scanners incorporate this feature. It works by scanning the film with infrared light; the dyes in typical color film emulsions are transparent to infrared light, but <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> are not, and block infrared; scanner software can use the visible and infrared information to detect scratches and process the image to greatly reduce their visibility, considering their position, size, shape, and surroundings.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> on {{the film}} {{can be a big}} problem for scanning. Because of their reduced size (compared to prints) the {{scanners}} are capable of resolutions much higher than a regular flatbed scanner; typically at least 2000 samples per inch (spi), up to 4000 spi or more. At these resolutions <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> take on gigantic proportions. Even small specks of dust, invisible to the naked eye, can obscure a cluster of several pixels. For this reason, techniques have been developed to remove their appearance from a scan, see film restoration.|$|E
50|$|The term Digital ICE {{initially}} applied {{specifically to}} a proprietary technology developed by Kodak's Austin Development Center, formerly Applied Science Fiction (ASF), that automatically removes surface defects, such as <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches,</b> from scanned images.|$|E
50|$|Infrared {{cleaning}} {{works by}} collecting an infrared channel from the scan {{at the same}} time as the visible colour channels (red, green, and blue). This is done by using a light source that also produces infrared radiation, and having a fourth row of sensors on the linear CCD sensor. Photographic film is mostly transparent to infrared radiation (no matter what the visible image contains) but <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> aren't, so they show up in the IR channel. This information can then be used to automatically remove the appearance of <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> in the visible channels and replace them with something similar to their surroundings. A major limitation of this technique is that it can only be used on dye-based (color and chromogenic black-and-white) films; the image-forming silver particles in most black-and-white film stocks are opaque to infrared radiation.|$|E
5000|$|Kodak's own scanner, the [...] "pro-lab" [...] Kodak HR500 Plus was {{equipped}} with Digital ICE that could scan Kodachrome slides effectively, however, this scanner was discontinued in 2005. Nikon produced the Nikon Super Coolscan LS-9000 ED scanner with {{a new version of}} ICE (Digital ICE Professional) from 2004 until it was discontinued in 2010. This was capable of scanning Kodachrome slides reliably, dust- and scratch-free, without additional software. LaserSoft Imaging released an infrared <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratch</b> removal tool (iSRD - Infrared Smart Removal of Defects) in 2008, that allows Nikon's film scanners for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows, as well as many scanners from other manufacturers to make high quality scans of Kodachrome slides. Fujifilms system for <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratch</b> removal, called [...] "Image Intelligence", works on a similar principle as Digital ICE and will also work on Kodachrome film.|$|R
50|$|Scanner {{manufacturers}} {{usually have}} their own name attached to this technique. Kodak developed Digital ICE at their Austin development centre, and is licensed by Epson, Konica Minolta, Microtek, Minolta, Nikon, and some others. Canon developed its own FARE (Film Automatic Retouching and Enhancement) system. LaserSoft Imaging developed the iSRD <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratch</b> removal, on which among others Plustek is relying.|$|R

5000|$|The three color dyes {{in typical}} color film {{emulsions}} are largely transparent to infrared light, so the infrared image is almost uniformly clear, unlike the RGB images. [...] On the other hand, <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> absorb in the infrared. Any dust spots or scratches appear as dark {{marks in the}} infrared, making them easy to find and compensate for.|$|E
50|$|MiniDiscs come in {{a plastic}} caddy {{protecting}} the disc's surface from <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches.</b> MiniDisc Walkmans are able to play and record MiniDiscs from digital and analogue sources, such as live audio from their microphone inputs. The first unit on the market, the MZ-1 was relatively large and unpocketable, but following model, MZ-R2, and subsequent MD Walkmans are quite compact, with today's MiniDisc Walkmans not {{much larger than the}} discs themselves.|$|E
50|$|The {{other major}} {{obstacle}} is the incompatible (and technically corrupted) error-correction data. Again, {{the effect of}} this is dependent on the disc drive; some drives will be able to read the data without problems, but others will produce audio files with loud pops every few seconds. As a consequence of having faulty error-correction codes, the discs may be less resilient to anything that might cause a read error, such as <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> resulting from normal use.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Stokes {{polarimetry}} for scattering {{light from a}} sample surface. To achieve a high accuracy measurement two approaches of an intensity detector and analysis algorism of a Stokes parameter were proposed. The dynamic range of this detector can achieve up to 1010 by combination of change of neutral-density (ND) filters having different density and photon counting units. Stokes parameters can be measured by dual rotating of a retarder and an analyzer. The algorism of dual rotating polarimeter can be calibrated small linear diattenuation and linear retardance error of the retarder. This system can measured Stokes parameters from − 20 ° to 70 ° of its scattering angle. It is possible to measure Stokes parameters of scattering of <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratch</b> of optical device with high precision.

50|$|Infrared {{cleaning}} is {{a technique}} used by some film scanners and flatbed scanners to reduce or remove the effect of <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> upon the finished scan.

The infrared channel, {{in combination with the}} other channels, is used to detect the location of scratches and dust. Once located, those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by inpainting.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a robust technique to detect local deteriorations of old cinematographic films. This method relies on spatio-temporal informations and combines two different detectors : a morphological detector which uses spatial {{properties of the}} deteriorations to detect them, and a dynamic detector based on motion estimation techniques. Our deterioration detector has been validated on several film sequences and {{turned out to be}} a powerful tool for digital film restoration. 1. Introduction Most of the techniques in use today for cinematographic film restoration are based on chemical and mechanical manipulations. Applying digital techniques to the field of film restoration let us expect results beyond today's limitations such as automated processing, correction of photographed <b>dust</b> spots <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> (i. e. after film duplication), the removal of large defects, etc. Our research institute is involved, beside the Laboratoires Neyrac Films company, in the European LIMELIGHT project [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In optical {{recording}} systems, servo mechanisms accurately follow the track in three dimensions: radial, focus, and rotational speed. Everyday handling damage, such as <b>dust,</b> fingerprints, <b>and</b> tiny <b>scratches,</b> not only affects retrieved data, but also disrupts the servo functions. In some cases, the servos may skip tracks or get stuck. Specific sequences of pits and lands are particularly susceptible to disc defects, and disc playability {{can be improved}} if such sequences are barred from recording. The use of EFM produces a disc that is highly resilient to handling and solves the engineering challenge in a very efficient manner.|$|R
5000|$|Image editors may {{feature a}} number of {{algorithms}} which can add or remove noise in an image. Some JPEG artifacts can be removed; <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> can be removed and an image can be de-speckled. Noise reduction merely estimates {{the state of the}} scene without the noise and is not a substitute for obtaining a [...] "cleaner" [...] image. Excessive noise reduction leads to a loss of detail, and its application is hence subject to a trade-off between the undesirability of the noise itself and that of the reduction artifacts.|$|E
50|$|While drum {{scanners}} {{are capable}} of scanning both reflective and transmissive artwork, a good-quality flatbed scanner can produce good scans from reflective artwork. As a result, drum scanners are rarely used to scan prints now that high-quality, inexpensive flatbed scanners are readily available. Film, however, is where drum scanners {{continue to be the}} tool of choice for high-end applications. Because film can be wet-mounted to the scanner drum, which enhances sharpness and masks <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches,</b> and because of the exceptional sensitivity of the PMTs, drum scanners {{are capable of}} capturing very subtle details in film originals.|$|E
50|$|The analog {{information}} encoded on LaserDiscs {{does not include}} any form of built-in checksum or error correction. Because of this, slight <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> on the disc surface can result in read-errors which cause various video quality problems: glitches, streaks, bursts of static, or momentary picture interruptions. In contrast, the digital MPEG-2 format information used on DVDs has built-in error correction which ensures that the signal from a damaged disc will remain identical to that from a perfect disc {{right up until the}} point at which damage to the disc surface is so substantial that it prevents the laser from being able to identify usable data.|$|E
5000|$|A hunter-case {{pocket watch}} {{is a case}} with a spring-hinged {{circular}} metal lid or cover, that closes over the watch-dial and crystal, protecting them from <b>dust,</b> <b>scratches</b> <b>and</b> other damage or debris. The name originated from England where [...] "fox hunting men found it convenient {{to be able to}} open their watch and read the time with one hand, while holding the reins of their 'hunter' (horse) in the other hand".It is also known as a [...] "savonnette", after the French word for soap (savon) due to its resemblance with a round soap bar.|$|R
5000|$|The long-playing 33 rpm {{microgroove}} vinyl record, or [...] "LP", {{was developed}} at Columbia Records and introduced in 1948. The short-playing but convenient 7-inch 45 rpm microgroove vinyl single {{was introduced by}} RCA Victor in 1949. In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs {{by the end of}} the 1950s, but in some corners of the world the [...] "78" [...] lingered on far into the 1960s. Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable and the compact [...] "45" [...] format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. If played with a good diamond stylus mounted in a lightweight pickup on a well-adjusted tonearm, it was long-lasting. If protected from <b>dust,</b> scuffs <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> there was very little noise. Vinyl records were, over-optimistically, advertised as [...] "unbreakable". They were not, but they were much less fragile than shellac, which had itself once been touted as [...] "unbreakable" [...] compared to wax cylinders.|$|R
50|$|Many {{scanners}} use {{an additional}} infrared channel to detect defects, as the long wave infrared radiation {{passes through the}} film but not through <b>dust</b> particles. <b>Dust,</b> <b>scratches,</b> <b>and</b> fingerprints on the slide are typically detected and removed by a scanner's software. Kodachrome interacts with this infrared channel in two ways. The absorption of the cyan dye extends into the near infrared region, making this layer opaque to infrared radiation. Kodachrome also has a pronounced relief image that can affect the infrared channel. These effects can sometimes cause a slight loss of sharpness in the scanned image when Digital ICE or a similar infrared channel dust removal function is used.|$|R
5000|$|The cyan, magenta, {{and yellow}} records had {{suffered}} from shrinkage over the decades, and the software {{used in the}} restoration morphed all three records into the correct alignment. The software was also used to remove <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> from the film by copying data, for example, from the cyan and yellow records to fix a blemish in the magenta record. Restoring the movie {{made it possible to}} see what could not be seen before: when the Scarecrow says [...] "I have a brain", burlap is noticeable on his cheeks. It was also not possible to see a rivet between the Tin Man's eyes prior to the restoration.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the impact of litter type and litter treatment with enzymatic-bacterial production incidence and severity of footpad dermatitis and consequently on behavior of broiler chickens. A total of 1, 200 one day-old Ross 308 broilers were randomly allocated to 4 treatments with 4 replicates in 2 x 2 factorial design. The first factor was the physical form of the straw (chopped on approximately 2 cm or un-chopped) and the second factor was addition of enzymatic-bacterial product applied directly on the straw. Each replicate consisted of 75 as-hatched birds per pen. Occurrence and severity of the footpad dermatitis and histological evaluation of the scores was done {{at the end of the}} trial (42 days of age). During the trial, at 3 and 6 weeks of age, broiler behavior was observed by Scan Sampling Method. The results showed that chopped straw significantly lowered the incidence of footpad dermatitis. Chopped straw in combination with enzymatic-bacterial product showed the lowest footpad dermatitis score in broilers. Histological procedures confirmed the macroscopic evaluation of the footpad dermatitis severity. The chopped straw had a significant effect on some behavioral patterns of broiler chickens. Differences were observed for <b>dust</b> bathing <b>and</b> <b>scratching.</b> Correlation between footpad dermatitis and birds locomotor activity was not confirmed...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{areas are}} {{complicated}} {{due to the}} mix of man-made features and natural features. A higher level of structural information {{plays an important role}} in land cover/use classification of urban areas. Additional spatial indicators have to be extracted based on structural analysis in order to understand and identify spatial patterns or the spatial organization of features, especially for man-made feature. It 9 ̆ 2 s very difficult to extract such spatial patterns by using only classification approaches. Clusters of urban patterns which are integral parts of other uses may be difficult to identify. A lot of public resources have been directed towards seeking to develop a standardized classification system and to provide as much compatibility as possible to ensure the widespread use of such categorized data obtained from remote sensor sources. In this paper different methods applied to understand the change in the land use areas by understanding and monitoring the change in urban areas and as its hard to apply those methods to classification results for high elements quantities, <b>dusts</b> <b>and</b> <b>scratches</b> (Roca <b>and</b> Alhaddad, 2005). This paper focuses on a methodology developed based relation between urban elements and how to join this elements in zones or clusters have commune behaviours such as form, pattern, size. The main objective is to convert urban class category in to various structure densities depend on conjunction of pixel and shortest distance between them, Delaunay triangulation has been widely used in spatial analysis and spatial modelling. To identify these different zones, a spatial density-based clustering technique was adopted. In highly urban zones, the spatial density of the pixels is high, while in sparsely areas the density of points is much lower. Once the groups of pixels are identified, the calculation of the boundaries of the areas containing each group of pixels defines the new regions indicate the different contains inside such as high or low urban areas.
