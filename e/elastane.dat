5000|$|Spandex (<b>elastane)</b> {{is known}} for its {{exceptional}} elasticity. It is stronger and more durable than rubber, its major non-synthetic competitor. It was invented in 1959 by Charles Lewis French Jr. and Taylor.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s Speedo added <b>elastane</b> {{to their}} swimsuits that {{improved}} their elasticity, durability and reduced water drag - 21 out of 22 records at the 1972 Olympics were broken using nylon/elastane suits.|$|E
50|$|Stretch fabrics {{evolved from}} the {{scientific}} effort to make fibres using neoprene. From this research, in 1958 commercial stretch fabrics ('elastomerics') such as spandex or <b>elastane</b> (widely branded as 'Lycra') {{were brought to the}} market.|$|E
50|$|Spandex, Lycra or <b>Elastane</b> is a {{synthetic}} fiber {{known for its}} exceptional elasticity. It is stronger and more durable than natural rubber. It is a polyether-polyurea copolymer that was invented in 1958 by chemist Joseph Shivers at DuPont's Benger Laboratory in Waynesboro, Virginia. When introduced in 1962, it revolutionized {{many areas of the}} clothing industry.|$|E
50|$|Speedo {{began the}} next decade by {{completing}} its acquisition of Robert Shaw and Company in 1971. The 1970s also saw the company pioneer the use of <b>elastane</b> (spandex) and the brand's use in Olympic record breaking continued at the 1972 Munich and 1976 Montreal games, the latter of which Speedo was an official swimwear licensee.|$|E
5000|$|Fingerless cycling gloves, {{also known}} as track mitts. These have a lightly padded palm of leather (natural or synthetic), gel or other material.

5000|$|For example, if a T-shirt {{consists}} of 80% cotton and 20% <b>elastane</b> {{this has to}} be declared on the label of the garment. If the shirt {{consists of}} 100% cotton one can choose between [...] "100% cotton" [...] or [...] "completely made of cotton" [...] or [...] "pure cotton". For things made of wool and silk there are special regulations. Annex One of the law regulates the denomination of the various filaments.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{multiple}} patented technologies that concern hybrid grass, {{such as the}} following examples: SISGrass, developed by SIS Pitches, uses a specific technology to inject polyethylene fibres into the soil, AirFibr, a technology developed by Natural Grass, which uses natural cork as the softness element, and Fibrelastic, developed by Mansfield Sand, which uses <b>elastane</b> fibres as the softness element. and GrassMaster, developed by Desso, obtained a patent on hybrid grass system based on injected fibres.|$|E
50|$|A skin-tight garment is {{a garment}} that is {{held to the}} skin usually by elastic tension using some type of stretch fabric. Commercial stretch fabrics ('elastomerics') such as spandex or <b>elastane</b> (widely branded as 'Lycra') came onto the market in 1962, and {{revolutionized}} {{many areas of the}} clothing industry.

5000|$|The S number {{often is}} used in {{conjunction}} with the word [...] "super" [...] which originally meant the best wool, (called choice wool in the United States) [...] As now used Super means pure new wool and can also be used for fabrics made from wool blended with rare fiber (such as mohair, cashmere wool and alpaca), and also with silk. The inclusion of <b>Elastane</b> to give the fabric a stretch effect is permitted, as also is the inclusion of up to 5% non-wool yarn for decorative effects. For wool blend fabric descriptions, the word Super is not permitted. Subject to the wool content being at least 45%, the S number may be used.|$|E
5000|$|Up {{until this}} time, {{there was little}} reason for women outside show {{business}} to wear [...] "panty hose", as the longer hemlines allowed {{for the use of}} over-the-knee stockings secured with a garter belt. Nonetheless, during the 1960s, improved textile manufacturing processes made pantyhose increasingly more affordable, while man-made textiles such as spandex (or <b>elastane)</b> made them more comfortable and durable. The advent of the fashionable miniskirt, which exposed the legs to well above the knee, made pantyhose a necessity to many women. In 1970, U.S. sales of pantyhose exceeded stockings for the first time, and it has remained so ever since. Pantyhose became a wardrobe staple throughout the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|Maternity clothes {{around the}} world have been {{undergoing}} significant changes. In both Eastern and Western cultures, there is greater demand for fashionable maternity clothes. In Western cultures the influence of celebrity culture means that pregnant women in the public eye are taking the lead on maternity fashion. [...] As a result, pregnant women are no longer trying to hide or disguise their [...] "baby bumps", instead choosing to wear garments which closely fit their new shape, often emphasising the bust and abdominal area. Fashion bloggers have caught on to the shift in perception too and began regularly discuss new styles and fabrics designed with the pregnant form in mind. High-tech fabrics such as <b>elastane</b> are the material of choice for maternity wear in Western cultures as they allow garments to be form-fitting while allowing the abdominal area to expand as necessary.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{stockings}} {{became popular}} in the 1920s with the rise in women's hemlines. They were sheer, first made of silk or rayon (then known as [...] "artificial silk"), and after 1940 of nylon. Nylon stockings were cheap, durable, and sheer compared to their cotton and silk counterparts. These stocking were very popular, {{and the demand for}} them has continued, though it has given ground to tights or pantyhose. During the 1960s, improved textile manufacturing processes made pantyhose cheaper, while spandex (or <b>elastane)</b> made them more comfortable and durable, and the miniskirt made the pantyhose a necessity to many women. The popularity of pantyhose grew into a wardrobe staple throughout the 1970s and 1980s. From 1995 there was a steady decline in sales of pantyhose, levelling off in 2006 with American sales less than half of what they had once been.|$|E
5000|$|The {{performance}} of the fabric/garment is enhanced or achieved {{by a number of}} processes like selection of fibers and blending of the performance fibers during spinning, knitting or weaving along with other yarns like cotton, viscose, bamboo, polyester, acrylic, nylon, and <b>elastane</b> and also by processing and finishing with chemicals (also known as functional finishes) during dyeing or at finishing stages by padding or coating and some of them also possible at the garment stage.Nanotechnology can provide high durability for Performance fabrics,because nano-particles have a large suface area-to -volume ratio and high surface energy,thus presenting better affinity for fabrics and leading to an increase in durability of the function.The potential of nanotechnology in the development of new materials in the textile industry is considerable.

50|$|Public nudity was a {{major concern}} in {{designing}} early swimwear. It {{was a major}} factor behind the non-participation of American women in the 1912 Olympics. At those Games British women wore full-body silk suits of such a volume {{that they could be}} passed through a wedding ring. The suits were complemented by bras and bikini-style briefs as they became transparent when wet. Women's coaches were rare at early Olympics, and to further reduce the chances of harassment women were accompanied by chaperones. Even men wore one-piece swimsuits covering the body from hips to shoulders up to the 1940s. In 1928, Speedo introduced their racerback silk suit that was optimized to fit the body shape. It uncovered the shoulder blades, which almost resulted in disqualification of Clare Dennis at the 1932 Olympics, but became a norm by 1936. Meanwhile, men were allowed to swim in bare-chest suits in 1936, and in briefs only at the 1948 Olympics. In 1956, Speedo became the first company to introduce nylon and in the 1970s <b>elastane</b> to their swimsuits that improved their elasticity, durability and water drag - 21 out of 22 records at the 1972 Olympics were broken using nylon/elastane suits.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} percentages of <b>elastane</b> and Nylon yarn on the dimensional and physical properties of elastanelNylon Locknit warp knitted fabrics are investigated. In order {{to investigate the}} properties ofthe fabric, four different samples were knitted by selecting four different run-in ratios of <b>elastane</b> and Nylon. <b>Elastane</b> yarn was kept at a constant elongation of 65 % for all four samples. Two samples were produced keeping constant run-in of nylon yarn and changing the run-in length of <b>elastane</b> yarn. Then <b>elastane</b> yarn run-in was kept constant and produced two other samples. The sample with minimum run-in length of <b>elastane</b> yarn and the highest run-in ratio has the highest value of load at 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % extensions in length direction and the lowest values of load at 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % extensions in width direction. This {{is due to the}} fact that low run in of <b>elastane</b> yarn increases the strain on the yarn and it increases the tightness factor value of the sample and contributes higher load at extension along the length direction of the greige sample. Nylon yarn runner length influences the relaxation behavior of <b>elastane</b> yarn and it leads to reduce the load at extension along the width direction of the sample. Changing of Nylon yarn runner length influence the relaxation behavior of <b>elastane</b> yarn and it has an effect on the load at different extension in width direction and course density of the greige fabric. Results revealed that the effect of <b>elastane</b> content of the sample is more on the load at extension values than the effect of run-in of the Nylon yarn...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{mechanical}} behaviour of compression arm sleeves based on knitted fabrics has been reported.

The performance of developed arm sleeves was characterized in terms of level of compression that can be achieved as well as the permanent deformation and energy dissipation, which occurs during stretching. It was observed that the compression performance improved significantly with the linear density of <b>elastane</b> core and the improvement is higher for finer cover yarns. However, the energy dissipation and permanent deformation in the first stretching cycle also increased with the fineness of <b>elastane</b> core and therefore, proper selection of <b>elastane</b> yarn is extremely necessary to achieve required degree of compression with minimum permanent deformation while stretching...|$|E

40|$|Fusibles {{are used}} to improve the {{aesthetic}} and performance characteristics of wool fabrics. The peel strength of fused composites determines the durability of the pressing operation and they are influenced from the process conditions, the characteristics of fusible interlining and the fabric to whom they are sticked to. In this study, it was aimed to analyze the effect of fusible type and process conditions, weave type and different <b>elastane</b> compositions on peel strength. To this aim, two fusible types combined with eight different types of wool fabrics having different amount of <b>elastane</b> were studied. It was found out that only the fusible type and the process conditions are confirmed statistically that they influence the peel strength values. Nonetheless, it was observed as the <b>elastane</b> composition increased, the peel strength values tend to increase for twill type of fabrics and tend to decrease for plain type of fabrics. Moreover, the influence of composition may be in different direction when different type of Fusibles is used to form fusible composites. In conclusion, it can be stated that the dominant mechanism in determination of the peel strength is the selection of fusible type and suitable process conditions for this fusible type and more investigations are necessary if {{the composition of the}} material is also influential on the peel strength because of its compatibility with the fusible interlining. ...|$|E
