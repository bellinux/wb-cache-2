40|$|One of {{the reasons}} of {{pavement}} failure is weak subgrade, which causes rutting, alligator cracking, and upheaval. To prevent sub grade failure, adequate compaction as in the specification must be carried out. Proper quality assurance and quality compliance (QA/QC) procedure must be followed to ensure that compaction is carried out adequately. Existing Public Work Department (PWD) Specification for Road Work (JKR 7 SPJ/ 88) relating to compaction only require in-situ field density test and moisture content to ensure that compaction is carried out correctly. There is no specification on the determination of subgrade strength although the strength of subgrade in terms of elastic modulus is important as input in pavement design. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to obtain the in-situ subgrade strength to ensure that the pavement is correctly designed. This research details a study on road subgrade using three types of in-situ devices undertaken on six 150 -metres length <b>flexible</b> <b>pavement</b> <b>subgrade</b> test sections. The devices used in this study include the in-situ CBR, Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DC?) and Portable Falling Weight Deflectometer (PFWD). Tests using these devices were carried out at specified spacing on the test sections to determine the subgrade CBR, DCP-PR in (mm/blow) and elastic modulus values. The results obtained for laboratory CBR (unsoaked and soaked), in-situ CBR, DCP-PR in (mm/blow) and modulus subgrade were analysed and correlated to develop models to relate the values obtained. It was found that there is a reasonable relationship between the in-situ CBR and the laboratory unsoaked CBR values. The relationship between in-situ CBR with the DCP-PR in (mm/blow) values was found to be conclusive as high positive values of correlation were obtained. The relationship between in-situ CBR with the P-FWD modulus values was found to be inconclusive. The relationship obtained between DCP and P-FWD is a positive correlation. It is recommended that DCP test be included in all PWD road construction specification so that the subgrade strength of the pavement could be checked to meet the desired requirement...|$|E

It uses variety space of coloumn (L) which is 1 D, 1, 25 D and 1, 5 D and uses variety depth of coloumn which is 10 cm, 15 cm and 20 cm. Some test are required to determine characteristic of soil sample, such as spesific gravity, atteberg limit, clasification of soil based on USCS and standar compaction. To determine bearing capacity of soil it use loading test, and for test to determine swelling potential is based on ASTM 4546 - 86.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Civil Engineering, Washington State UniversityVery often {{deformation}} of <b>pavement</b> <b>subgrade</b> involves soils that are partially saturated. Many {{of the past}} constitutive models have limited application to modeling the behavior of such soils as their development was focused on either dry or fully saturated soils. This study uses the recent advances in unsaturated soil mechanics to modify the formulations of the Drucker Prager Cap (DPC) model. The effects of moisture variation freeze-thaw cycles on clayey and silty <b>pavement</b> <b>subgrade</b> behavior are studied using this modified DPC model. Simplified procedures for the determination of model parameters are developed. Laboratory tests on three types of silty and clayey soil were performed; the specimens were prepared with several moisture contents and subjected to freeze-thaw cycles. Test results show that for all three types of soils, the yield stresses of the specimens with lower moisture contents are higher at the same volumetric strain; elastic modulus, the initial and failure Cap position and the aspect ratio of Cap surface are lower when specimens have high degree of saturation. The elastic modulus and all the parameters of Cap surface of all soil types are significantly higher under frozen conditions, especially for the specimens with high moisture contents. On the other hand, the elastic modulus of soils is slightly decreased after freeze-thaw cycles while the parameters of Cap surface remained the same. The modified DPC model was implemented into the finite element program and used to simulate the behavior of <b>pavement</b> <b>subgrade</b> subjected to traffic loads under varying moisture and free-thaw cycles conditions. A three-dimensional finite element model representing the geometry properties of full-scaled APT tests was created.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is aimed at improving the accuracy {{of one of the}} components of a <b>flexible</b> <b>pavement</b> design procedure commonly used in South Africa, namely the South African Mechanistic- Empirical Design Method. This is achieved through {{the development of a new}} design approach and permanent deformation model for the <b>pavement</b> <b>subgrade.</b> The new distress model for the <b>pavement</b> <b>subgrade</b> was developed from a comprehensive Accelerated Pavement Testing (APT) database on subgrade behaviour and permanent deformation that was generated by a fleet of Heavy Vehicle Simulators (HVSs) over 20 years of testing in South Africa. A literature review of the origin of the current subgrade design model that is used by the South African Mechanistic-Empirical Design Method revealed that that model is based on very little actual subgrade performance data. The model was also developed from the AASHO road test data and adjusted for South African conditions, based on general observations of subgrade behaviour without any calibration. Previous researchers have illustrated the potential of using Heavy Vehicle Simulator data to develop structural pavement design models and it was decided to apply a similar process to the permanent deformation of the <b>pavement</b> <b>subgrade.</b> The present investigation consisted of two components, namely, the evaluation of the resilient and the permanent deformation response of the <b>pavement</b> <b>subgrade,</b> the emphasis in this thesis being more on the permanent deformation response. A general, multi-dimensional empirical model was formulated for the permanent subgrade deformation and the characteristics of the model investigated based on previously published permanent deformation data and mathematical assessment. A set of 35 HVS tests for which suitable data were available was identified and additional field and laboratory tests were done on selected sites to improve the classification of the subgrade materials at these sites. Standard procedures were developed to present the pavement, instrumentation and load sequence data of each HVS test. A process for doing the initial analysis of the deflection and permanent MDD displacement data and presenting the data was also developed. In terms of the resilient response of the subgrade, it was shown that the vertical depth deflection and vertical strain could be modelled accurately if an appropriate set of resilient modulus values was selected for the pavement layers. A detailed investigation of the resilient response of selected HVS sections did, however, clearly illustrate the stress-dependent behaviour of subgrade material, resulting in resilient modulus values being determined, which were well outside the range that would normally be expected for natural gravel subgrade material. This research needs to be continued to enable the development of a comprehensive set of stress-dependent resilient modulus models for South African subgrade materials. The selection of an appropriate critical parameter that can be used as a predictor of permanent subgrade deformation was done by an investigation of the relationship between potential critical parameters and several permanent deformation parameters. It was found that the subgrade elastic deflection showed the best correlation with the subgrade bearing capacity (the number of load repetitions that can be sustained before a terminal rut condition is reached). The vertical subgrade strain that is currently used in the South African Mechanistic-Empirical Design Method in fact correlates poorly with subgrade bearing capacity and has to be replaced with subgrade elastic deflection. A set of subgrade bearing capacity or design models was developed for different levels of permanent subgrade deformation. These models are referred to as S-N models and form contour lines on the general permanent deformation model that was formulated. The subgrade design model accommodates loading conditions ranging from a 40 kN dual wheel load to a 100 kN dual wheel load as well as subgrade materials ranging from a material quality one class better than that which would normally be used for a subgrade, to the lowest possible material class. The model is therefore very flexible in terms of its application. Prof. P. Pretoriu...|$|R

40|$|Extended abstractImprovements in {{a number}} of areas related to both routine and {{sophisticated}} design and construction affect the economic success of pavement foundations as well as transportation earthworks. These areas include modelling of the behaviour of embankments and pavement foundations, design of earthworks, preparation and quality control of <b>pavement</b> <b>subgrade</b> and earthwork quality control methods and procedures. Furthermore, modelling, design and construction of granular layers (structural layers) can also have an important effect in pavement performance...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{understanding of}} materials characterization of asphalt mixtures {{is required to}} determine the appropriate asphalt mixtures so that pavement distress and deformation can be reduced. Various numerical modeling and laboratory tools are {{used to assess the}} asphalt mixtures of <b>flexible</b> <b>pavement</b> and provided a significant and novel contribution to understanding of characterization of asphalt mixtures and design of <b>flexible</b> <b>pavement.</b> The contribution to understanding from this thesis shall be integrated in future body of knowledge...|$|R
