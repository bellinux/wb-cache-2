Previous results showed that a single session of cathodal transcranial <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> stimulation can improve symptoms in childhood dystonia.

We applied anodal, cathoP:dal or sham transcranial <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> stimulation (57 microA/cm(2), 10 min) to the left or right posterior parietal cortex. Using a visual detection task in a group of right-handed healthy individuals (n = 20), we observed that transcranial <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> stimulation enhanced or impaired performance depending on stimulation parameters (i. e. current polarity) and stimulated hemisphere. These results are in good accordance with classic models of reciprocal interhemispheric competition ('rivalry').

Interestingly, both the inhibitory effect of cathodal transcranial <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> stimulation applied over the unlesioned posterior parietal cortex and the facilitatory effect of anodal transcranial <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> stimulation applied over the lesioned posterior parietal cortex reduced symptoms of visuospatial neglect.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The goal of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} short- and long-term success and complications of radiofrequency atrioventricular (AV) junction catheter ablation and to compare these with those of high energy <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> catheter ablation. Background. Catheter ablation of the AV junction with radiofrequency or <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> energy is an accepted treatment for drug-refractory supraventricular tachycardias. Few data are available on the long-term success and effects of radiofrequency ablation or its comparison with <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> ablation. Methods. Fifty-four patients who underwent attempted AV junction ablation with radiofrequency energy were followed up for a mean of 24 ± 8. 4 months. These patients were retrospectively compared with 49 patients who underwent attempted AV junction ablation with <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> energy and were followed up for a mean of 41 ± 23 months. Results. The early success rate at the time of discharge for radiofrequency ablation was 81. 5 %, which was not statistically different from that for <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> ablation (85. 7 %). Fewer sessions were required to achieve complete AV block in the radiofrequency group (1. 05 ± 0. 23) (mean ± SD) compared with the <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> group (1. 21 ± 0. 41) (p = 0. 02). Although overall complication rates were similar for both groups (9. 3 % in the radiofrequency group and 8. 2 % in the <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> group), there was a trend toward more life-threatening early complications in those patients who received direct-current shocks (6. 8 %) than in those who underwent radiofrequency ablation alone (2. 3 %) (p = 0. 1). Early sudden death (one patient), early ventricular tachycardia (two patients) and cardiac tamponade (one patient) were seen only in those patients who underwent ablation with <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> energy, whereas pulmonary embolism (one patient) was the only early life-threatening complication in the radiofrequency group. During follow-up, the rate of recurrence of AV conduction was the same (5 %) for both the <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> and radiofrequency groups. In the <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> group, one patient died suddenly 2 weeks after the procedure and another had a cardiac arrest due to ventricular tachycardia 6 h after the procedure. In the radiofrequency group, two patients died suddenly at 11 and 7 months, respectively. Two patients, one who had unsuccessful radiofrequency ablation and required <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> ablation, were resuscitated from ventricular tachycardia. Conclusions. Radiofrequency energy appears to be as efficacious as and perhaps safer than <b>direct</b> <b>current</b> energy for AV junction ablation...|$|R
