5|$|British {{immersive}} theatre company Punchdrunk {{took inspiration}} from the Paisley witch trials for their ongoing New York City production, Sleep No More. <b>Gallow</b> Green, {{the name of the}} fictitious Scottish town that serves as the show's setting, as well as many of the characters (including Fulton, Bargarran, Reid, Agnes Naismith, Catherine Campbell, James Lindsey, and Nurse Christian Shaw) were all taken from the witch trials and interwoven with the elements of William Shakespeare's Macbeth found throughout the immersive production.|$|E
5|$|Seven people– Margaret Lang, John Lindsay, James Lindsay, John Reid, Catherine Campbell, Margaret Fulton, and Agnes Naismith– {{were found}} guilty of having bewitched Shaw and were {{condemned}} to death. One subsequently committed suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell, and {{it is believed that}} Naismith may have died while imprisoned. The other five were hanged and then burned on the <b>Gallow</b> Green in Paisley on 10 June 1697, the last mass execution for witchcraft in western Europe.|$|E
25|$|By the Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746 {{the powers}} {{of life and death}} were removed from the Baron Court and the {{criminal}} jurisdiction was very significantly reduced but not entirely abolished. The hereditary jurisdictions of Regality Courts and of the Sheriff Courts were abolished and the owners received significant sums in compensation. It can be stated therefore that most moot and <b>gallow</b> hills ceased to have a role in the judicial process at that time.|$|E
50|$|Will <b>Gallows</b> and the Snake-Bellied Troll is a 2011 fantasy/western children's book by Northern Irish author Derek Keilty and {{the first}} book in the ongoing Will <b>Gallows</b> series.

5000|$|On the April 11 {{episode of}} Raw, <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson (with <b>Gallows</b> {{returning}} to his former WWE ring name, Luke <b>Gallows)</b> made their debut, attacking The Usos after their victory over The Social Outcasts, before being removed by several referees. On the April 18 episode of Raw, Anderson and <b>Gallows</b> attacked WWE World Heavyweight Champion Roman Reigns, following Reigns' promo with AJ Styles. The following week on Raw, Anderson and <b>Gallows</b> would make their in-ring debuts, defeating the Usos. During this time, Anderson and <b>Gallows</b> would help Styles in his feud with Reigns, with Styles at first reluctant for their help, until the May 2 episode of Raw, when Styles teamed with Anderson and <b>Gallows,</b> where they began being known as The Club, defeating Reigns and the Usos. On the May 9 episode of Raw, The Club would face Reigns and the Usos in a 6-man Elimination match, where, following the elimination of both <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson, Reigns and the Usos would win by disqualification after <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson attacked Reigns with a steel chair. At Extreme Rules, Anderson and <b>Gallows</b> would interfere in Reigns' and Styles' Extreme Rules match for Reigns' WWE World Heavyweight Championship. They would attack Reigns until the Usos, who lost their Tornado Tag Team match to Anderson and <b>Gallows</b> earlier in the night, brawled with the two until Reigns would retain. The following night on Raw, Styles requested to leave The Club, stating that the WWE [...] "wasn't Japan". Anderson and <b>Gallows</b> left Styles shortly after Styles would lose to Kevin Owens in a Money in the Bank qualifying match. On the May 30 episode of Raw, AJ Styles would confront a returning John Cena who said the [...] "new era" [...] {{would have to go}} through him, before offering Styles his hand. Styles shook his hand, shortly before Anderson and <b>Gallows</b> would interrupt. As Styles and Cena appeared ready to fight Anderson and <b>Gallows,</b> Styles instead beat down Cena repeatedly, reuniting The Club and cementing a heel turn.|$|R
50|$|After that, The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk, Joey Mercury and Luke <b>Gallows)</b> faced Big Show in a Handicap match. In the end, Big Show {{delivered}} a KO Punch to <b>Gallows</b> and {{delivered a}} Chokeslam to Mercury onto <b>Gallows,</b> pinning Mercury {{to win the}} match.|$|R
25|$|Although Paplay {{retracted}} {{his confession}} {{just before his}} execution, Balfour and her family were transported to Kirkwall, where they were tortured until a confession was extracted. Balfour was tried, found guilty of witchcraft, and sentenced to death. Just as Paplay had done, Balfour retracted her confession immediately before her execution, publicly proclaiming her innocence and detailing the tortures carried out on her and members of her family. She was executed at <b>Gallow</b> Ha' in Kirkwall on 16 December 1594.|$|E
25|$|Despite Colville's pledge Balfour {{was found}} guilty of conspiring to murder by the use of {{witchcraft}} and was sentenced to be strangled and burned. On 16 December 1594 Balfour was taken to <b>Gallow</b> Ha' in Kirkwall to be executed. Before the strangulation she was required to make a declaration in front of the gathered crowd and five ministers, including Colville, for the notary public; instead she proclaimed her innocence and detailed the tortures carried out against her and her family. Immediately prior to Balfour's sentence being enacted, attempts were made to have her implicate the Laird of Stenhouse, Patrick Bellenden, in the conspiracy by questioning her about a piece of wax he had given her. It had been retrieved from her purse when she was arrested and her inquisitors considered it was to make an effigy. She denied their claims stating it was to produce a treatment for Lady Bellenden's colic.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} that the moot hill was also the actual site of executions; folklore, {{tradition}} and the association of separate 'gallow' places names with moot hills on balance suggests that the usual place of execution was a separate 'gallows hill'. At Gardyne Law however an eye witness recalled that judgement and execution took place on the same law. It does seems unlikely that in those superstitious days meetings would be held at places of death; at Mugdock separate moot and <b>gallow</b> hills are a good example. Such gallows may have been built of worked timber or a Dule Tree may have been used. RCAHMS records show that human bones have been frequently found in association with 'gallows' place name sites, but not at 'moot' sites. The term 'murder hole' may relate to the drowning sites, bones have been found close to some of these.|$|E
50|$|After that, Jon Stewart, {{acting as}} a {{replacement}} for the injured Big E, introduced the WWE Tag Team Champions, The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods) for their title defense against Luke <b>Gallows</b> and Karl Anderson. <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson executed the Magic Killer on Kingston, but Stewart entered the ring and distracted them. <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson then tried to injure Stewart's groin using the ring post when Big E ran in, making his return, and attacked <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson, thus causing a disqualification. <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson won the match, but The New Day retained the championship.|$|R

500|$|One {{of those}} convicted, James Reid {{committed}} suicide by hanging {{himself in his}} prison cell, using his handkerchief attached to a nail in the wall. The remaining six were hanged and then burned on the <b>Gallow</b> Green in Paisley on 10June 1697, the last mass execution for witchcraft in western Europe. John and James Lindsay, brothers from Formakin Mill, near Houston, aged 11 and 14 respectively, held each other's hands as they were hanged together. Catherine Campbell, after having been carried struggling and screaming to the gallows, [...] "called down the wrath of God and the Devil on her accusers" [...] before being despatched. Margaret Fulton appeared to have become insane, and [...] "spoke cheerfully about visits to Elfland and the Abode of the Fairies {{on the backs of}} magical horses". Margaret Lang admitted to consorting with the Devil, but said that she had renounced sin and was reconciled with God. Agnes Naismith laid a [...] "dying woman's curse" [...] on everyone present and their descendants; for many years afterwards every tragedy in the town was blamed on [...] "the witches' curse".|$|E
500|$|The {{hotel was}} {{designed}} mainly by London and Paris based designers in the Louis XVI style, {{which is consistent}} throughout, giving the hotel its [...] "special atmosphere of perfect appropriateness and elegant restraint". Marcus Binney describes the great suite of ground-floor rooms as [...] "one of the all-time masterpieces of hotel architecture" [...] and compares it to a royal palace with its [...] "grand vistas, lofty proportions and sparkling chandeliers". Waring & <b>Gallow</b> were responsible {{for many of the}} fine design work of the interiors The ground floor plan dated to 1906 illustrated a large main restaurant overlooking the terrace and garden, a large central Grand Gallery and Winter Garden, a circular vestibule beyond the reception room, the Marie Antoinette Suite near the restaurant, and numerous shops. The Grill Room had its own entrance {{on the right side of}} the entrance doors on Piccadilly, with a staircase leading down. The Grill Room was on the eastern side, and the Banqueting Hall lay at the western end, beneath the restaurant. Today this is home to the Ritz Club. A wide vaulted corridor, the Long Gallery, runs from the Arlington Street entrance on the east side to the restaurant on the west side, with finely woven Savonnerie carpets. Along it are several intricate horseshoe archways. A triangular-shaped staircase features in the building's southwest corner. The curving main staircase was built to allow women to make a [...] "dramatic entrance and show off their gowns to best effect".|$|E

50|$|The Payback's {{main event}} match {{led to a}} feud between the trio of Styles, <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson and the trio of Reigns and The Usos. After Styles' trio beat Reigns' trio on the May 2 episode of Raw, <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson wanted Styles to hit Reigns with a chair, but he refused, thus {{resulting}} in The Usos attacking Styles from behind with a chair and Styles retaliating with the chair, until Reigns ultimately established his dominance by executing a powerbomb on Styles through the announce table. That same week on SmackDown, the two trios had a rematch where Reigns pinned Anderson for Anderson's first WWE loss. On the next week's Raw, with Styles, <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson now named as The Club, Reigns and The Usos beat them in a six-man elimination tag team match: Jey Uso, then Anderson, Jimmy Uso and <b>Gallows</b> were pinned, and finally Styles was disqualified when Anderson interfered to prevent Reigns repeating his announce table powerbomb on Styles. On the May 12 episode of SmackDown, The Usos defeated <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson via disqualification, but <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson came up top in the post-match brawl with neither Styles nor Reigns appearing to help. On the May 16 episode of Raw, The Usos defeated <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson via pinfall. At Extreme Rules on May 22, <b>Gallows</b> and Anderson defeated The Usos in a tornado tag team match, whilst later in the night Styles lost to Reigns in an Extreme Rules match.
