5|$|Many {{writers have}} speculated {{on the ways}} in which a {{friendly}} civilization might interact with humankind. Albert Harrison, a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California, Davis, thought that a highly advanced civilization might teach humanity such things as a physical theory of everything, how to use zero-point energy, or how to travel faster than light. They suggest that collaboration with such a civilization could initially be in the arts and humanities before moving to the hard sciences, and even that artists may spearhead collaboration. Seth D. Baum, of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, and others consider that the greater longevity of cooperative civilizations in comparison to uncooperative and aggressive ones might render extraterrestrial civilizations in general more likely to aid humanity. In contrast to these views, however, Paolo Musso, a member of the SETI Permanent Study Group of the <b>International</b> <b>Academy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Astronautics</b> (IAA) and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, took the view that extraterrestrial civilizations possess, like humans, a morality driven not entirely by altruism but for individual benefit as well, thus leaving open the possibility that at least some extraterrestrial civilizations are hostile.|$|E

500|$|Citing Carl A. Brown's 1985 A History of Aviation, Tim Brady, the Dean of Aviation at Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University, {{wrote in}} 2000: [...] "the {{development}} of the jet is, broadly, the story of three men: Henri Coanda, Sir Frank Whittle, and Pabst von Ohain..." [...] His description of Coandă's disputed test flight agreed that fuel injection and combustion had been initiated in the rotary compressor's vent, with the novel detail that the aircraft [...] "flew for about a thousand feet [...] before crashing into a wall." [...] In 1990 at the 24th Symposium of the <b>International</b> <b>Academy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Astronautics,</b> one of the papers presented included this sentence: [...] "It is to Henri Coanda (1886–1972), a world famous inventor and pioneer of jet flight, that space engineering owes—beside {{one of the first}} model planes provided with a rocket engine (1905)—the construction and engine experiment of the first jet aircraft, the 'Coanda-1910'." [...] In 2007 in his popular book Extreme Aircraft, Ron Miller wrote that the powerplant in the Coandă-1910 was one of the [...] "earliest attempts" [...] at a jet engine, but was unsuccessful—it was [...] "incapable of actual flight", unlike the engines designed by Whittle and Ohain. The question of the Coandă-1910 being the first jet aircraft {{does not appear to be}} resolved, supporting Stine's view: [...] "Whether Henri Coanda built the first true jet will probably be argued interminably." ...|$|E

2500|$|A post-detection policy (PDP), {{also known}} as a post-detection protocol, is a set of {{structured}} rules, standards, guidelines, or actions that governmental or other organizational entities plan to follow in the [...] "detection, analysis, verification, announcement, and response to" [...] confirmed signals from extraterrestrial civilizations. Though no PDPs have been formally and openly adopted by any governmental entity, there is significant work being done by scientists and nongovernmental organizations to develop cohesive plans of action to utilize in the event of detection. The most popular and well known of these is the “Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence", which was developed by the <b>International</b> <b>Academy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Astronautics</b> (IAA), {{with the support of the}} International Institute of Space Law. The theories of PDPs constitute a distinct area of research but draw heavily from the fields of SETI (the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), METI (Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), and CETI (Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence).|$|E
2500|$|Winterberg {{is known}} for his work in the fields of nuclear fusion and plasma physics, and Edward Teller has been quoted as saying that he had [...] "perhaps not {{received}} the attention he deserves" [...] for his work on fusion. He is an elected member of the Paris-based <b>International</b> <b>Academy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Astronautics,</b> in which he sat on the Committee of Interstellar Space Exploration. According to his faculty webpage, in 1954 he [...] "made the first proposal to test general relativity with atomic clocks in earth satellites" [...] and his thermonuclear microexplosion ignition concept was adopted by the British Interplanetary Society for their Project Daedalus Starship Study. His current research is on the [...] "Planck Aether Hypothesis", [...] "a novel theory that explains both quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity as asymptotic low energy approximations, and gives a spectrum of particles greatly resembling the standard model. Einstein's gravitational and Maxwell's electromagnetic equations are unified by the symmetric and antisymmetric wave mode of a vortex sponge, Dirac spinors result from gravitationally interacting bound positive-negative mass vortices, which explains why the mass of an electron is so much smaller than the Planck mass. The phenomenon of charge is for the first time explained to result from the zero point oscillations of Planck mass particles bound in vortex filaments." [...] The theory proposes that the only free parameters in the fundamental equations of physics are the Planck length, mass, and time, and shows why R3 is the natural space, as SU2 is treated as the fundamental group isomorphic to SO3 [...] an alternative to string field theories in R10 and M theory in R11. It permits the value of the finestructure constant at the Planck length to be computed, and this value remarkably agrees with the empirical value. He has published extensively on many aspects of physics from the 1950s through the present. In 2008, Winterberg criticized string theory and pointed out the shortcomings of Einstein's general theory of relativity because of its inability to be reconciled with quantum mechanics at [...] the Physical Interpretations of Relativity Theory conference and published his findings in Physics Essays.|$|E
