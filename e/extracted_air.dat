50|$|Warm, {{moist air}} is {{drawn into the}} unit at A in the diagram above. This air passes into a {{crossflow}} plate heat exchanger (B) where a substantial proportion of the sensible heat is transferred to a cool supply air stream. This process brings the <b>extracted</b> <b>air</b> close to saturation. The air then passes to the plenum chamber of the extract fan (C) where a portion of it may be rejected to outside. The amount that is rejected can be varied and is determined either by legislation on fresh air requirements, or by the requirement to maintain a fresh, odour free environment. The balance of the air then passes into the evaporator coil of the heat pump where it is cooled and the moisture is condensed. This process yields substantial amounts of latent energy to the refrigeration circuit. Fresh air is then introduced to replace the amount that was extracted and the mix is discharged by the supply fan (G) to the crossflow plate exchanger (B) where it is heated by the extract air from the pool. This pre-warmed air then passes through the heat pump condenser (F) where it is heated by the latent energy removed during the condensation process {{as well as the}} energy input to the compressor. The warm dry air is then discharged to the room.|$|E

The aim of this work is to study the {{possibility}} of integration of a reversible heat pumping system into the existing HVAC system of a “commercial” building (which includes laboratories). A pre-audit of the actual HVAC installation {{is carried out}} and presented. Numerical models of the building and of the coupled HVAC installation are developed and implemented on EES (Engineering Equation Solver, ©F-Chart Software) to run yearly simulations.

Other retrofit possibilities, as “change over” technique or cool thermal energy storage, are also modelled, simulated and analysed. The environmental and economical aspects of each retrofit opportunity are approached. The reversible heat pumping coupled with a change over technique is generally able to satisfy the heating demand of the building. However some interventions of the existing natural gas condensing boilers, as back boosting devices, are sometimes necessary during winter. The economical and environmental studies reveal a quite short payback time and a significant reduction of CO 2 emissions.

The reduced fat content would also help to protect the air handling unit, which comprised recovery of heat from the <b>extract</b> <b>air.</b> However, there is a health respect for ozone, which is a highly reactive irritant. Chemical reactions may also lead to the production of nitrogen dioxide, aldehydes and other volatile organic compounds.

40|$|Various {{gas turbine}} cycles are known where water is {{introduced}} as a liquid or as a vapor into the combustor {{of the gas}} turbine. Such cycles include the Humid Air Turbine (HAT) cycle, the Steam Injected (STIG) cycle, and the Regenerated Water Injected gas turbine cycle (RWI). The effect of water vapor is the increasing of net power output and the reduction of NOx formation within the combustor. However the net increase in power output is limited in commercial models of gas turbines, because a large addition of water vapor leads to the mismatch between the compressor and the turbine. In this paper a possible method {{to solve this problem}} is proposed: it is based on a novel concept for combining refrigeration and power production in humid gas turbine cycles. In the proposed system a fraction of the air at compressor discharge is extracted, cooled to nearly ambient temperature, dried and expanded in a turbine. At turbine outlet the air is at a very low temperature and can be used for providing refrigeration. A thermodynamic analysis has been carried out to investigate the performance of the system in HAT, STIG and RWI cycles for different operating conditions representing the state of art of commercial gas turbines. In particular the pressure ratio and the turbine inlet temperature have been respectively varied in the range 7 - 45 and 900 - 1500 °C. Sensitivity analyses have been performed to assess how the amounts of <b>extracted</b> <b>air</b> and injected steam affect the net power output, the electrical efficiency and the cooling.

40|$|Increasing {{aircraft}} engine efficiency {{and reducing the}} engines weight have driven innovation in the {{aircraft engine}} business since its inception. By simply looking at the Brayton cycle increasing the compressor pressure ratio can bring about an increase in efficiency. To achieve this high pressure ratio, multi-stage axial compressors are used, {{which tend to be}} both heavy and expansive. Increasing the number of stages in an axial compressor can increase the pressure ratio and therefore the thermal efficiency; however as the number of stages increases, the engine weight, cost and length also increase, all of which are detrimental to the overall aircraft performance. Recent work by Kerrebrock, Merchant, and Schuler, has led to the possibility of achieving high pressure ratios with a {{reduction in the number of}} stages. These compressors use aspiration, or suction on the surface of the blades and endwalls, to keep the boundary layer attached over a greater percentage of the blade chord. Keeping the boundary layer attached longer allows the each blade row to be more highly loaded than the equivalent non-aspirated blade. This higher loading means fewer stages are needed to achieve a given pressure rise. The <b>extracted</b> <b>air</b> is brought inside the blade where it is removed at a convenient location. This bleed air can contain a substantial amount of energy that can be used for numerous purposes on the aircraft or engine. Recovery of the bleed flow and its disposition are important factors in the success of aspirated compressor technology. In this study it is assumed the bleed air can be used for threes purposes: its is returned to the turbine as cooling air, expanded overboard to augment the engine thrust or used to perform "auxiliary work" in a different part of the aircraft. The thermodynamic efficiency (as measured by the specific impulse) and the installed efficiency of the compression system were calculated for different engine/fan configurations and compared with equivalent non-aspirated engines. This allows the effects of aspiration to be quantified and can be used to assess if aspiration is viable for a specific setting. by Niall McCabe. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} {{results from the}} patent search and review of domestic and foreign publications in variable cycle engines (VCE) was created a classification of the possible schematic diagrams of VCE realizing three-stream engine technologies (the adaptive low pressure compressor (LPC) with air extraction behind stages, FLADE compressor, various feeding types of extraction air to the flowing path of the engine, etc.). To estimate a three-stream engine application {{as a part of}} the power-plant (PP) efficiency, was chosen an adaptive LPC technology scheme with the third contour air bypass beyond the critical section of a basic jet nozzle for which a mathematical model (MM) of the PP has been created on the basis of one-dimensional MM of the engine. The MM of the PP included 3 D modeling results of the air inlet, the LPC with various air extractions to the third contour, and the jet nozzle taking into account the interaction between the basic stream and the third contour stream. The predicted performance of an air inlet have been used to estimate the changes in a total pressure restoration coefficient and an additional resistance coefficient along «a fluid contour» when air extraction is included in the third contour in several cruiser modes of flight. An integrated characteristic of the LPC has been received at various points and levels of air extraction to the third contour, and parameters of <b>extracted</b> <b>air</b> (depending on the point and amount of air extraction, and also on the fan operating mode) have been calculated. When analyzing the obtained calculation results, the effect of pressure lines displacement to the right (towards the large reduced rates), growth of efficiency values, and also position displacement of its maximum value to the left (towards the descent reduced rates) has been found. To estimate how air extraction of the third contour between the plates of an adjustable supersonic nozzle impacts on its aft deck resistance various parameters of the flowing out air in subsonic cruiser mode of flight have been calculated. As a result of calculations according to the PP MM, under near-the-earth conditions of the subsonic cruiser flight, the effective specific fuel consumption has been reduced by 12, 5 %. The results reached allow us to expect significant subsonic effective fuel conservation of the three-stream engine. To prove the calculated results it is further necessary to achieve them under full-scale conditions using the engine-demonstrator. </p...|$|E

40|$|This air {{emissions}} document supports {{implementation of the}} Treatability Test Plan for Soil Desiccation as outlined in the Deep Vadose Zone Treatability Test Plan for the Hanford Central Plateau (DOE/RL- 2007 - 56). Treatability testing supports evaluation of remedial technologies for technetium- 99 (Tc- 99) contamination in the vadose zone at sites such as the BC Cribs and Trenches. Soil desiccation has been selected as the first technology for testing {{because it has been}} recommended as a promising technology in previous Hanford Site technology evaluations and because testing of soil desiccation will provide useful information to enhance evaluation of other technologies, in particular gas-phase remediation technologies. A soil desiccation pilot test (SDPT) will evaluate the desiccation process (e. g., how the targeted interval is dried) and the long-term performance for mitigation of contaminant transport. The SDPT will dry out a moist zone contaminated by Tc- 99 and nitrate that has been detected at Well 299 -E 13 - 62 (Borehole C 5923). This {{air emissions}} document applies to the activities to be completed to conduct the SDPT in the 200 -BC- 1 operable unit located in the 200 East Area of the Hanford Site. Well 299 -E 13 - 62 is planned to be used as an injection well. This well is located between and approximately equidistant from cribs 216 -B- 16, 216 -B- 17, 216 -B- 18. and 216 -B- 19. Nitrogen gas will be pumped at approximately 300 ft{sup 3 }/min into the 299 -EI 3 - 62 injection well, located approximately 12 m (39 ft) away from extraction well 299 -EI 3 - 65. The soil gas extraction rate will be approximately 150 ft{sup 3 }/min. The SDPT will be conducted continuously over a period of approximately six months. The purpose of the test is to evaluate soil desiccation as a potential remedy for protecting groundwater. A conceptual depiction is provided in Figure 1. The soil desiccation process will physically dry, or evaporate, some of the water from the moist zone of interest. As such, it is expected that Tc- 99 and nitrate will remain with the water residual that is not removed, or remain as a salt bound to the soil particles. In addition, the SDPT will be conducted at lower extraction velocities to preclude pore water entrainment and thus, the <b>extracted</b> <b>air</b> effluent should be free of the contaminant residual present in the targeted moist zone. However, to conservatively bound the planned activity for potential radionuclide air emissions, it is assumed, hypothetically, that the Tc- 99 does not remain in the zone of interest, but that it instead travels with the evaporated moisture to the extraction well and to the test equipment at the land surface. Thus, a release potential would exist from the planned point source (powered exhaust) for Tc- 99 in the extracted moist air. In this hypothetical bounding case there would also be a potential for very minor fugitive emissions to occur due to nitrogen injection into the soil. The maximum value for Tc- 99, measured in the contaminated moist zone, is used in calculating the release potential described in Section 2. 3. The desiccation mechanism will be evaporation. Nitrate is neither a criteria pollutant nor a toxic air pollutant. It would remain nitrate as a salt adhered to sand and silt grains or as nitrate dissolved in the pore water. Nitrogen, an inert gas, will be injected into the ground during the test. Tracer gasses will also be injected near the beginning, middle, {{and the end of the}} test.
