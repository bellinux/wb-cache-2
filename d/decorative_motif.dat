5|$|Since {{classical}} antiquity, {{the area}} around Kvarner Bay has been characterized as a meeting point of diverse cultures—from Hellenic and Roman cultures, through the Middle Ages and a succession of various rulers, to the present day. This blending {{is reflected in the}} folklore of the area, including Zvončari—bell-ringers best known for annual pageant in Kastav, listed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Crossbowmen from Rab are a living history company reenacting an arbalest tournament first held in 1364 to commemorate the successful defence of the island using that weapon. A typical <b>decorative</b> <b>motif</b> used in the region is morčić (plural: morčići)—a dark skinned Moor used as a centerpiece on jewelry, usually earrings. Legend has it that the motif is related to a hypothesized battle between Croatian and Ottoman armies on Grobnik north of Rijeka, but {{it is more likely that}} it is of Venetian origin, as it is similar to the Venetian moretti motif, used mostly on brooches and pins.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire nonetheless, the double-headed eagle {{remained}} a strong symbol of reference for the Greeks. Most characteristically, the Orthodox Church continues to use the double-headed eagle extensively as a <b>decorative</b> <b>motif,</b> and has also adopted a black eagle on yellow/gold background as its official flag.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, the {{lightning}} rod became a <b>decorative</b> <b>motif.</b> Lightning rods were embellished with ornamental glass balls (now prized by collectors). The ornamental appeal of these glass balls {{has been used}} in weather vanes. The main purpose of these balls, however, is to provide evidence of a lightning strike by shattering or falling off. If after a storm a ball is discovered missing or broken, the property owner should then check the building, rod, and grounding wire for damage.|$|E
25|$|The hexagram {{does appear}} {{occasionally}} in Jewish contexts since antiquity, apparently as a <b>decorative</b> <b>motif.</b> For example, in Israel, {{there is a}} stone bearing a hexagram from the arch of a 3rd–4th century synagogue in the Galilee. Originally, the hexagram may have been employed as an architectural ornament on synagogues, as it is, for example, on the cathedrals of Brandenburg and Stendal, and on the Marktkirche at Hanover. A pentagram in this form is found on the ancient synagogue at Tell Hum. In the synagogues, perhaps, it {{was associated with the}} mezuzah.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, {{the image}} of the Green Man enjoyed a revival in the 19th century, {{becoming}} popular with architects during the Gothic revival and the Arts and Crafts era, when it appeared as a <b>decorative</b> <b>motif</b> in and on many buildings, both religious and secular. American architects took up the motif around the same time. The Green Man travelled with the Europeans as they colonized the world. Many variations can be found in Neo-gothic Victorian architecture. He was very popular amongst Australian stonemasons and can be found on many secular and sacred buildings.|$|E

25|$|During the 19th {{century the}} symbol began to proliferate among the Jewish {{communities}} of Eastern Europe, ultimately being used among the Jewish {{communities in the}} Pale of Settlement. A significant motivating factor, according to scholar Gershom Sholem, was the desire to represent Jewish religion and/or identity {{in the same manner}} the Christian cross identified that religion's believers. The earliest Jewish usage of the symbol was inherited from medieval Arabic literature by Kabbalists for use in talismanic protective amulets (segulot) where it was known as a Seal of Solomon. The symbol was also used in Christian churches as a <b>decorative</b> <b>motif</b> many centuries before its first known use in a Jewish synagogue. Before the 19th century, official use in Jewish communities was generally known only in the region of today's Czech Republic, Austria and possibly parts of Southern Germany, having begun in medieval Prague.|$|E
25|$|The {{art history}} of the Hellenic era is {{generally}} subdivided into four periods: the Protogeometric (1100–900 BC), the Geometric (900–700 BC), the Archaic (700 – 500 BC) and the Classical (500 – 323 BC) with sculpture being further divided into Severe Classical, High Classical and Late Classical. The first signs of the particular artistic character that defines ancient Greek architecture are {{to be seen in}} the pottery of the Dorian Greeks from the 10th century BC. Already at this period it is created with a sense of proportion, symmetry and balance not apparent in similar pottery from Crete and Mycenae. The decoration is precisely geometric, and ordered neatly into zones on defined areas of each vessel. These qualities were to manifest themselves not only through a millennium of Greek pottery making, but also in the architecture that was to emerge in the 6th century. The major development that occurred was in the growing use of the human figure as the major <b>decorative</b> <b>motif,</b> and the increasing surety with which humanity, its mythology, activities and passions were depicted.|$|E

These motifs are in the next part described in detail and compared with parallels belonging to the Great Moravian cultural background. Finally we will focus on symbolism of chosen motifs, try to interpret them and also suggest where the debated motifs originated from.

25|$|The Khazar state was, Oppenheim says, {{the only}} Jewish state to rise between the Fall of the Second Temple (67–70 CE) and the {{establishment}} of Israel (1948), and its example stimulated messianic aspirations for a return to Israel as early as Judah Halevi. In the time of the Egyptian vizier Al-Afdal Shahanshah (d.1121), one Solomon ben Duji, often identified as a Khazarian Jew, attempted to advocate for a messianic effort for the liberation of, and return of all Jews to, Palestine. He wrote to many Jewish communities to enlist support. He eventually moved to Kurdistan where his son Menachem some decades later assumed the title of Messiah and, raising an army for this purpose, took the fortress of Amadiya north of Mosul. His project was opposed by the rabbinical authorities and he was poisoned in his sleep. One theory maintains that the Star of David, until then a <b>decorative</b> <b>motif</b> or magical emblem, began to assume its national value in late Jewish tradition from its earlier symbolic use by Menachem.|$|E
25|$|There was {{demonstrable}} {{continuity in}} the south, {{even though the}} Danish settlement represented a watershed in England's artistic tradition. Wars and pillaging removed or destroyed much Anglo-Saxon art, while the settlement introduced new Scandinavian craftsmen and patrons. The result was to accentuate the pre-existing distinction between {{the art of the}} north and that of the south. In the 10th and 11th centuries, the Viking dominated areas were characterised by stone sculpture in which the Anglo-Saxon tradition of cross shafts took on new forms, and a distinctive Anglo-Scandinavian monument, the 'hogback' tomb, was produced. The decorative motifs used on these northern carvings (as on items of personal adornment or everyday use) echo Scandinavian styles. The Wessexan hegemony and the monastic reform movement appear to have been the catalysts for the rebirth of art in southern England {{from the end of the}} 9th century. Here artists responded primarily to continental art; foliage supplanting interlace as the preferred <b>decorative</b> <b>motif.</b> Key early works are the Alfred Jewel, which has fleshy leaves engraved on the back plate; and the stole and maniples of Bishop Frithestan of Winchester, which are ornamented with acanthus leaves, alongside figures that bear the stamp of Byzantine art. The surviving evidence points to Winchester and Canterbury as the leading centres of manuscript art in the second half of the 10th century: they developed colourful paintings with lavish foliate borders, and coloured line drawings.|$|E

500|$|Early {{sketches}} show a 13-story {{building with}} Ancient Egyptian ornament {{and a slight}} flaring at the top, divided visually into five sections with a lotus-blossom <b>decorative</b> <b>motif.</b> This design was never approved, as Brooks waited for {{the real estate market}} in the south Loop, still mostly warehouses, to improve. Where Root was known for the detailed ornamentation of his designs (as seen in the Rookery Building), Brooks was known for his stinginess and preference for simplicity. For the Monadnock, Brooks insisted that the architects refrain from elaborate ornamentation and produce instead [...] "the effect of solidity and strength, or a design that will produce that effect, rather than ornament for a notable appearance." [...] In an 1884 letter to Aldis, he wrote: [...] While Root was on vacation, Burnham had a draftsman create a [...] "straight up-and-down, uncompromising, unornamented facade." [...] Objecting at first, Root later threw himself into the design, declaring that the heavy lines of an Egyptian pyramid had captured his imagination and that he would [...] "throw the thing up without a single ornament".|$|E

It was later rebuilt to a relatively more modern style, with a slanted front end.

2500|$|The {{body of the}} standard, {{depicting}} a dragon-like balaur or a large snake, was seen by the Dacians {{as a manifestation of}} the sky demon or [...] "heavenly dragon". This relates to their supreme god Zalmoxis who was a sky god (cf. also Tomaschek). In the Hallstatt Period [...] "proper", the decorative pattern of a dragon head or a serpent became quite common in Dacia. The dragon symbol is also represented on the silver Dacian bracelets of the Classical period. The snake-shaped bracelets and other similar ornaments show not only the spread of the snake as a <b>decorative</b> <b>motif</b> but also its significance in Dacian material civilization.|$|E

2500|$|Many changes {{occurred}} during the Nixon administration {{under the direction of}} First Lady Pat Nixon. Clement Conger, the new White House curator appointed during the Nixon administration, had completed substantial Chippendale and Neoclassical interiors at the United States Department of State. In the Green Room, {{as well as in the}} Blue and Red rooms, Conger addressed correcting the generic traditional plaster moldings put in place during the Truman reconstruction, installing historically accurate crown moldings and ceiling medallions. Conger commissioned Edward Vason Jones and David Byers to design new drapes of striped cream, green, and coral silk satin. [...] Conger and Jones cited illustrations shown in an early 19th-century pattern book belonging to the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now called Historic New England). Coral and gilt ornamental cornices were constructed and installed above the windows. They were topped by hand-carved, gilded American eagles with outspread wings, a favorite <b>decorative</b> <b>motif</b> of the Federal period. The cornices are similar to those in the library of the Miles Brewton House in Charleston, South Carolina, and the South Drawing Room of the Sir John Soane House in London in the United Kingdom. Scalamandré produced a copy of the Kennedy-era moss green silk to be rehung on the walls.|$|E
