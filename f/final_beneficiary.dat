The type of local arrangement capable of overcoming rivalry depends on the power that rules confer on the respective users.

The authors apply a theoretical justification set of variables affecting donor behaviour to a  questionnaire survey.

The operationalization of the used specialty language, {{on the one hand}} and on the other hand the efficient management of the financial situation acquire a significant role regarding a strategic partnership at the micro and macroeconomic level in business as long as the managerial structures of understanding the economic reality are put in correlation with the accountant's socio-professional training in the firm/concern. Even if the professional accountant is paid by a determined client, which is the <b>final</b> <b>beneficiary</b> of the development service or audit financial statements, the information drawn from these financial statements are used by those who form the public. In this way, the accounting profession is distinguished from the other profession by accepting its responsibility to the public. There are numerous studies on an international level, dealing with various methods of improving the decision making process. The most competitive multinational companies have already considered the opportunities favored by financial adjustments, directed at streamlining the accounting functions and they have also trained professionals in the field of accounting that would successfully perform as business partners, thus assisting the decision making process within the organization. The financial adjustments have become essential for many companies that have thus gained a significant competitive advantage. The plan for improving the efficiency of the financial function is very clear, but the training of the business partners who would provide assistance in making decisions still remains a challenge. The economic perspective on the account reality highlights a pragmatic materialization, at the company’s level, of some specific skills designed to support the important role that the financial situations have. So, the individual significations of the accounting practice generate inside society different attitudes of the economic actors. Moreover, a pragmatic accounting model allows the development of some strategies that can be made in accordance with the analysis-diagnosis services.

In 2004 the professionals from the National Library Regina Varnienė (group manager), Gražina Bastauskienė, Teresė Gustienė and Jolita Steponaitienė prepared the project “Creation of the LIBIS Virtual Environment” for digitization of old and rare documents and access to these documents via a virtual library. The results of the latter project were of great help in drafting the feasibility study “Creation of the Integrated Virtual Library Information System” (2004). It was worked out by the Italian company A. R. S. Progetti S. r. l., assisted by Lithuanian experts.

40|$|Hakutermit: local authorities, European Union, {{external}} aid, transnational city, focused interview, narrative analysis The aim of {{this study}} is to understand why the local authorities of the European Union (EU) participate in projects, funded by a special programme of the European Commission, in which they are not the final beneficiaries themselves but where the <b>final</b> <b>beneficiary</b> is a less developed city outside the EU. The topic is approached from the point of view of the political actorness of a European transnational city at the turn of the 21 st century. The processes of globalisation and Europeanisation are acknowledged as reshaping the arena of international relations. These processes have created a situation where cities are ever more independent actors in transnational relations, often acting local-to-local manner, i. e. local authorities from different nation-states form networks of common action. The empirical material of the study concerns two local-to-local projects funded through the Tacis programme of EU external aid. These are cooperative projects of the cities of Tampere (Finland) and Nizhni Novgorod (Russia) and Turku (Finland) and St. Petersburg (Russia). The projects are approached in the light of general city strategies and official documents, as well as four focused interviews made in both of the Finnish cities. The material is analyzed from the historical-hermeneutic perspective through narrative analysis. The result of the analysis is two “stories from the field” ­ the stories of how Tampere and Turku participated in Tacis projects. According to the analysis, the reasons for the participation of EU local authorities in Tacis projects are manifold. The case of Tampere represented a separate project connected to the strategic goals of the city. The connection to a third, European partner was an important motivating factor. The case of Turku represented a series of three projects, where the reasons for participation varied during cooperation. At the outset the motivating factor was to learn the EU project application techniques; in the long run personal contacts became crucial. In both cases the twinning agreements between the Finnish and Russian local authorities created the basis for action. All in all, the reasons for participation depended on the status of the interviewees. The two cases studies showed that there is a lot of coincidence in the scheme of participation. In the end these projects of international solidarity are connected to the ideology of sustainable development. This could open up interesting perspectives for further studies, which are much needed as the EU external aid remains an understudied area of EU affairs...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the potential offered by technological {{progress in the}} {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) industries for the health sector in developing countries, presents some examples of positive experiences in India, and considers the difficulties in achieving this potential. The development of ICTs can bring about improvements in health in developing countries in at least three ways: as an instrument for continuing education they enable health workers to be informed of and trained in advances in knowledge; they can improve the delivery of health and disaster management services to poor and remote locations; and they can increase the transparency and efficiency of governance, which should, in turn, improve the availability and delivery of publicly provided health services. These potential benefits of ICTs do not necessarily require all the <b>final</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> to be reached directly, thus the cost of a given quantum of effect is reduced. Some current experiments in India, {{such as the use of}} Personal Digital Assistants by rural health workers in Rajasthan, the disaster management project in Maharashtra and the computerized village offices in Andhra Pradesh and Pondicherry, suggest creative ways of using ICTs to improve the health conditions of local people. However, the basic difficulties encountered in using ICTs for such purposes are: an inadequate physical infrastructure; insufficient access by the majority of the population to the hardware; and a lack of the requisite skills for using them. We highlight the substantial cost involved in providing wider access, and the problem of resource allocation in poor countries where basic infrastructure for health and education is still lacking. Educating health professionals in the possible uses of ICTs, and providing them with access and "connectivity", would in turn spread the benefits to a much wider set of <b>final</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> and might help reduce the digital divide...|$|R
