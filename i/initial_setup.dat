5|$|On June 19, 2013, Microsoft {{announced}} (in {{response to}} the negative reaction) that it would reverse its changes to Xbox One's DRM and game licensing model. As with Xbox 360, users {{would be able to}} share and resell physical games without restrictions, and beyond a mandatory software update upon the console's <b>initial</b> <b>setup</b> process to enable playback of Blu-ray and DVD video, the console would not require a permanent internet connection to operate. These changes required the family sharing features, along with the ability to play games without their disc after installation, to be dropped. Xbox One chief product officer Marc Whitten stated that the family sharing feature may return in the future, but could not be implemented on launch due to time restraints. Don Mattrick, the then president of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business, stated that the licensing changes were in {{response to the}} negative public reaction. Other analysts believed that the change was in direct response of Sony's aggressive position during its E3 press conference. Mattrick, who had been a leader in Xbox One development, announced his departure from Microsoft on July 1, 2013, to become CEO of Zynga. Analysts speculated that his departure was predicated on the poor response and subsequent reversal of the plans for Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|The camera app {{includes}} a new shooting mode known as Zoe (alluding to the zoetrope), which captures a short video alongside each photo taken. Individual frames {{can be saved}} from the clip, while the frames {{can also be used}} with other editing features such as Sequence Shot (which superimposes multiple frames into a composite image). Photos taken in Zoe mode are also displayed with animated thumbnails in the gallery. The Highlights feature can automatically generate a montage video from photos and videos with multiple theme and soundtrack options. The resulting video can be exported, or posted online through the HTC Share service (where they are accessible for 30 days). A television guide app is also provided, which incorporates remote control functionality via an infrared blaster hidden in the One’s power button, show recommendations powered by Peel, and the ability to display show reminders as stories on BlinkFeed. An updated music app now {{includes a}} visualizer and support for on-screen lyrics. An updated version of the Get Started feature (as introduced by HTC One X+) allows users to perform <b>initial</b> <b>setup</b> for their One via a web-based service, while a new Sync Manager allows data to be migrated from iOS device backups or HTC devices with Android 4.0 and higher. As with all devices in the One series, 25GB of Dropbox storage is available free for two years. Using NFC, the One can also share content between other compatible Android devices with Android Beam, and conduct mobile payments where compatible systems (such as FeliCa in Japan) are available.|$|E

Rather, it remains a lion {{for the rest of the}} game. This should be obvious from the game pieces, which only have two sides.|$|E
25|$|The {{promotion}} {{rules of}} dai shogi {{may have changed}} significantly over time. The promotion rules in the earlier Heian shogi and Heian dai shogi provide for all weak stepping pieces to promote to the gold general, which is true for sho shogi and modern shogi. However, in chu shogi many of these pieces have changed promotions to ranging pieces in the <b>initial</b> <b>setup.</b> Dai shogi has a mixture of these rules: the weak steppers or limited rangers unique to dai shogi all promote to the gold general, but those present in chu shogi keep their promotion from the latter game. It is likely that these differing promotions in chu shogi are a later historical innovation, that was later copied back into dai shogi when chu shogi became more popular than dai shogi.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} I examine the {{foundations}} of physical externalism and social externalism and argue that these foundations are incompatible.

Thus, physical externalism and social externalism are incompatible just {{in the same way that}} the direct reference theory of proper names is incompatible with the description theory of proper names. My argument will proceed as follows. In Section One, I shall explain what the two theses say and spell out my suspicion. In Section Two, I shall take a look at the <b>initial</b> <b>setups</b> for physical externalism and social externalism by examining Putnam’s and Burge’s original arguments.
