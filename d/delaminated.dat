5|$|Hamilton {{set a new}} fastest lap of {{the race}} on lap 47 to reduce the time deficit to Vettel to 7.9 seconds. Petrov began to {{challenge}} de la Rosa for 12th place on the same lap. Hülkenberg's right rear tyre <b>delaminated</b> on lap 50, causing damage to his car's exhaust system and became the race's final retirement. Kobayashi made his only pit stop of the event on lap 53 and rejoined in ninth position behind Alonso. Button was worried about a possible post-race time penalty and pushed hard to record the overall fastest lap of the race, a 1:38.766, on the 54th lap. Alonso challenged Buemi for seventh place on lap 55 {{but was unable to}} pass him. Kobayashi ran closely behind Alonso and passed him around the inside for eighth when Alonso ran wide at turn 17 on the following lap. Buemi was overtaken by Kobayashi at the final corner on the last lap of the race to clinch seventh.|$|E
25|$|As a {{constituent}} of a coating: vermiculite dispersions are typically either chemically or physically very finely <b>delaminated</b> vermiculite in a fluid medium. These dispersions {{can be used}} to make vermiculite 'paper' sheets by pouring them onto a piece of smooth, low surface-energy plastic, and allowing to dry. The resulting sheet can then be peeled off the plastic.Typical end-uses for vermiculite dispersions include inclusion in high temperature coatings or binders for construction materials, gaskets, specialty papers/textiles, oxidation-resistant coating on carbon based composites, and as barrier coatings for films.|$|E
25|$|Mica's {{value is}} based on its unique {{physical}} properties. It has a crystalline structure which forms layers which can be split (<b>delaminated)</b> into very thin sheets (0.125 to 0.025mm. or thinner), while remaining stable when exposed to electricity). This gives it superior electrical properties as an insulator and a dielectric, as it can support an electrostatic field while dissipating minimal {{energy in the form}} of heat. It also has a high dielectric breakdown and is resistant to corona discharge. It is also stable when exposed to light, moisture and extreme temperatures. Mica is also chemically inert, dielectric, elastic, flexible, hydrophilic, insulating, lightweight, platy, reflective, refractive, resilient, and ranges in opacity from transparent to opaque.|$|E

An experimental study with upper supply and upper return air flow was performed in normal airflow room. The results were compared with numerical simulation results and were found to agree well. Information on <b>delaminating</b> laws, and measurements of the relationship of <b>delaminating</b> heights and air supply temperature and velocity is also presented.

25|$|Chaz Mostert won {{the first}} race of the Skycity Triple Crown ahead of {{teammate}} Mark Winterbottom. Rick Kelly took his second podium finish in three races by finishing third. James Courtney had taken pole position but tangled with Shane Van Gisbergen and Garth Tander on a restart after a safety car period, with Courtney penalised {{for his role in}} the incident. Jamie Whincup, Craig Lowndes and Jason Bright also received points penalties for various incidents during the race. Lowndes recovered in the second race to score his 100th career victory in the Australian Touring Car Championship and V8 Supercars, becoming the first driver to reach the mark. Tim Slade finished second ahead of Mostert. Rick Kelly had qualified on pole position for the first time since 2011 but collided with Fabian Coulthard at the first corner and received a drive-through penalty. David Reynolds took pole position for the Sunday race but Coulthard took the lead at the start. Coulthard lost the lead when he went off the track while lapping Andre Heimgartner, losing places to Reynolds and Mostert. Reynolds himself ran off the circuit in trying to avoid the lapped Michael Caruso, cutting off a portion of the track in the process. After retaking his place behind Caruso, Reynolds held off Mostert to take victory. A <b>delaminated</b> tyre for Lowndes towards the end of the race dropped him to fifteenth, allowing Winterbottom to extend his championship lead to 95 points.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{mechanism}} of imagery, a novel method called the <b>delaminating</b> combining template method, used for the problem of super-resolution reconstruction from image sequence, is described in this paper. The combining template method contains two steps: a <b>delaminating</b> strategy and a combining template algorithm. The <b>delaminating</b> strategy divides the original problem into several sub-problems; each of them is only connected to one degrading factor. The combining template algorithm is suggested to resolve each sub-problem. In addition, to verify the valid of the method, a new index called oriental entropy is presented.

During the race, Räikkönen was forced to take an extra stop when his left-rear tyre <b>delaminated,</b> which dropped him down to 12th. He recovered, but spun his car after pushing too hard while chasing Giancarlo Fisichella. He eventually finished fourth.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the failure}} of the ductile layers from {{collinear}} and <b>delaminating</b> cracks that occur in laminated composite systems was studied using a constitutive relationship that accounts for strength degradation resulting from the nucleation and growth of voids. The results indicate that in laminated composites, void nucleation and growth ahead of the cracks occur at a much faster rate due to evolution of much higher stress values at the interface region. For <b>delaminating</b> crack cases, the fracture behavior is strongly influenced by the delamination length. The resistance of the ductile layers to crack extension can be significantly reduced by short delamination lengths...|$|R
50|$|Delamination failure may be {{detected}} in the material by its sound; solid composite has bright sound, while <b>delaminated</b> part sounds dull, reinforced concrete sounds solid, whereas <b>delaminated</b> concrete will have a light drum-like sound when exposed to a dragged chain pulled across its surface. Bridge decks in cold climate countries which use de-icing salts and chemicals are commonly subject to delamination and as such are typically scheduled for annual inspection by chain-dragging as well as subsequent patch repairs of the surface. Other nondestructive testing methods are used, including embedding optical fibers coupled with optical time domain reflectometer testing of their state, testing with ultrasound, radiographic imaging, and infrared imaging.|$|E

40|$|Probabilistic edge-delamination {{strength}} of a thermosetting polymer composite was studied experimentally in this work. During the procedure, by means of edge-delamination tensile test, the graphite–fiber/epoxy laminate made of unidirectional Toray P 7051 S- 20 Q- 1000 prepregs with an optimized lay-up of [122 /– 122 / 02]S was used for examining its probabilistic distributions of the edgedelamination onset stress and the ultimate tensile strength. Acoustic emission (AE) equipment and optical microscope were utilized to capture the edge-delamination initiation and characterize the failure modes during <b>delaminating.</b> Fractographical analysis based on scanning electron microscope (SEM) was conducted for the characterization of the microscopic failure mechanisms of the composite laminate during edge <b>delaminating.</b> Probabilistic models were introduced for data reduction. Test {{results show that the}} edgedelamination onset stress and the ultimate tensile {{strength of}} the laminate tested satisfy two two-parameter Weibull distributions very well. AE signals show the main failure mode during edge <b>delaminating</b> is interlaminar shear failure, corresponding to that predicted by numerical simulation and confirmed by SEM fractographical results in this study...|$|R

50|$|Some MXenes {{have been}} {{investigated}} experimentally thus far in LIBs (e.g. V2CTx , Nb2CTx , Ti2CTx , and Ti3C2Tx). V2CTx has demonstrated the highest reversible charge storage capacity among MXenes in multi-layer form (280 mAhg−1 at 1C rate and 125 mAhg−1 at 10C rate). Nb2CTx in multi-layer form showed a stable, reversible capacity of 170 mAhg−1 at 1C rate and 110 mAhg−1 at a 10C rate. Although Ti3C2Tx shows the lowest capacity among the four MXenes in multi-layer form, it can be easily <b>delaminated</b> via sonication of the multi-layer powder. By virtue of higher electrochemically active and accessible surface area, <b>delaminated</b> Ti3C2Tx paper demonstrates a reversible capacity of 410 mAhg−1 at 1C and 110mAhg−1 at 36C rate. As a general trend, M2X MXenes {{can be expected to}} have greater capacity than their M3X2 or M4X3 counterparts at the same applied current, since M2X MXenes have the least number of atomic layers per sheet.|$|E
