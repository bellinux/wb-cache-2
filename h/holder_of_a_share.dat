5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money would go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> class <b>A</b> <b>shares</b> would not be entitled to a regular dividend, and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power <b>of</b> class <b>A</b> <b>shares,</b> essentially denying <b>a</b> controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{incentive}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> exclusive <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> technology to <b>share</b> it with competitors {{in a market}} with network externalities. We assume that high expected sales increase the willingness {{to pay for the}} good. This is named the "network effect". At a stable fulfilled expectations equilibrium, where the actual sales are equal to the expected ones, it is shown that, if the network effect is sufficiently strong, a quantity leader has an incentive to invite entry and license his technology without charge. If the quantity leader has the opportunity to use lump sum license fees, he will invite <b>a</b> larger number <b>of</b> competitors. If no lump sum fees are allowed, the leader will charge a decreasing fee in the intensity of the network externality and will invite entry. In markets with very strong network externalities, the leader pays a subsidy to the invited followers. We also show that the results hold under uncertainty, and when the post-entry competition is Cournot. Network externalities, monopoly, quantity leadership, entry, licensing...|$|R
