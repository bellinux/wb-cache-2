50|$|In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, ATF {{contained}} {{whale oil}} as a friction modifier.

A moratorium on whale oil at that time prevented the continued production of older ATF such as the original DEXRON formulation (Type B), and the Type A which preceded it. Vintage Chrysler products (Dodge, Plymouth, etc.) used Type A fluid, which is generally difficult to obtain now. It turns out that Type A was basically a nearly 50/50 mix of Type F (Ford) and Dexron (GM), so if you have a pre-1990 Chrysler vehicle, you can mix Type F and Dexron to get a near-match for type A. General Motors began marketing Dexron II Type C and later Dexron II Type D to replace the fluids which were made from whale oil.|$|R

The analysis was based on images of spray development, spark discharge and combustion to understand the effects of early and late injection strategies on in-cylinder phenomena. Specifically, `single'-injection strategies from early to late intake stroke as well as multiple `split' injection events with triple pulses in the early intake stroke or double pulses in the intake stroke and late compression stroke were investigated. The engine was run at 1500 r/min at part- and full-load conditions (0. 5 and 1. 0 bar inlet plenum pressure, respectively). <b>Engine</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 20 °C– 90 °C were employed to understand how fuel volatility {{was related to the}} phenomena observed. The sprays were imaged over a series of cycles primarily by laser sheet illumination on one vertical and two horizontal planes to identify three-dimensional aspects of the spray's development and its interactions with the incoming flow, valves, piston and liner. There was a clear fuel-impingement trade-off between early and late injection timings. The spark discharge was also imaged with all injection strategies and clear differences were observed. Selective combustion imaging provided insights into the flame's growth and motion with early and double early–late split injection strategies.

40|$|Although Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) {{represent}} {{one of the}} key {{technologies to}} reduce CO 2 emissions, their effective potential in real world driving conditions strongly depends on the performance of their Energy Management System (EMS) and on its capability to maximize the efficiency of the powertrain in real life as well as during Type Approval (TA) tests. Attempting to close the gap between TA and real world CO 2 emissions, the European Commission has decided to introduce from September 2017 the Worldwide Harmonized Light duty Test Procedure (WLTP), replacing the previous procedure based on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The aim of this work is the analysis of the impact of different driving cycles and operating conditions on CO 2 emissions and on energy management strategies of a Euro- 6 HEV through the limited number of information available from the chassis dyno tests. The vehicle was tested considering different initial battery State of Charge (SOC), ranging from 40 % to 65 %, and <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures,</b> from − 7 °C to 70 °C. The change of test conditions from NEDC to WLTP was shown to lead to a significant reduction of the electric drive and to about a 30 % increase of CO 2 emissions. However, since the specific energy demand of WLTP is about 50 % higher than that of NEDC, these results demonstrate that the EMS strategies of the tested vehicle can achieve, in test conditions closer to real life, even higher efficiency levels than those that are currently evaluated on the NEDC, and prove the effectiveness of HEV technology to reduce CO 2 emissions...|$|R
50|$|Control for the {{solenoids}} and {{stepper motors}} {{can be either}} closed loop or open loop. Closed loop systems rely on feedback from a manifold pressure sensor to meet a predetermined boost pressure. Open loop systems have a predetermined control output where control output is merely based on other inputs such as throttle angle and/or engine RPM. Open loop specifically leaves out a desired boost level, while closed loop attempts to target a specific level of boost pressure. Since open loop systems do not modify control levels based on MAP sensor, differing boost pressure levels may be reached based on outside variables such as weather conditions or <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>temperature.</b> For this reason, systems that do not feature closed loop operation are not as widespread.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{pressures}} on vehicle manufacturers {{to reduce their}} average fleet levels of CO 2 emissions have resulted in an increased drive to improve fuel economy and enable use of fuels developed from renewable sources that can achieve a net reduction in the CO 2 output of each vehicle. The most popular choice for spark-ignition engines has been the blending of ethanol with gasoline, where the ethanol is derived either from agricultural or cellulosic sources such as sugar cane, corn or decomposed plant matter. However, other fuels, such as butanol, have also arisen as potential candidates due to their similarities to gasoline, e. g. higher energy density than ethanol. To extract the maximum benefits from these new fuels through optimized engine design and calibration, {{an understanding of the}} behaviour of these fuels in modern engines is necessary. In particular, the use of direct injection spark-ignition technology requires spray formation and combustion characteristics to be quantified in order to improve both injector design and operating strategies. To this end an optical investigation of spray development and combustion was undertaken in a single-cylinder direct-injection spark-ignition engine with a centrally mounted multi-hole injector. Specifically, crank-angle resolved imaging studies were performed and batches of images from 100 consecutive cycles were acquired with synchronised in-cylinder pressure logging. The engine was motored and fired at 1500 RPM stoichiometrically under part load (0. 5 bar intake pressure), with injection timing set early in the intake stroke to promote homogeneous mixture formation. The effects were investigated at <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 20 °C and 90 °C using gasoline, iso-octane, ethanol and butanol. Projected spray areas as seen through the piston crown were calculated to reveal information about the atomization and evaporation processes for each fuel.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to study the {{numerous}} contributors towards cyclic variations in combustion in a direct injection spark ignition engine, simultaneous high-speed imaging of fuel injection and flame growth are undertaken on a crank-angle resolved basis in a single-cylinder optical research engine. Batches of images from 100 consecutive cycles are acquired for all conditions with synchronised in-cylinder pressure logging. The engine is motored and fired at stoichiometric conditions at 1500 RPM under part-load and wide-open-throttle conditions (0. 5 - 1. 0 bar intake pressure), with injection timing set early in the intake stroke to promote homogeneous mixture formation with a centrally mounted multi-hole injector. Liquid impingement is observed on the cylinder walls and on the piston crown with early intake injection and multiple injection strategies are employed in {{an attempt to}} reduce impingement and alter mixture preparation and subsequent combustion. The effects are investigated for iso-octane and pump-grade gasoline at <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 50 and 90 °C. Gasoline sprays showed severe deformation and partial collapse of the individual spray plumes at 90 °C, leading to a different mixture formation process relative to iso-octane, which showed no such effects at this engine temperature. Using multiple fuel injections per cycle, but maintaining the same overall air-to-fuel ratio with single-injection strategies, a significant reduction in direct impingement on the walls was observed, together with different flame growth relative to single injection. These results suggest that injection strategy and type of fuel is playing {{an important role in the}} mixture preparation process, even for homogeneous early direct injection, and that different types of multiple-injection strategies alone have the potential to modify significantly in-cylinder phenomena, affect combustion and potentially exhaust emissions.
