Holding the head noun phrase constant, three properties of the noun phrase within the modifier were manipulated: number (e. g., headmaster, headmasters), gender (e. g., <b>headmaster,</b> <b>headmistress),</b> <b>and</b> animacy (e. g., <b>headmaster,</b> blackboard), <b>and</b> the goal {{of the study was to}} determine whether different types of mismatch interfered with the pronoun agreement process to different extents. Results showed a robust effect of a number mismatch, no effect of an animacy mismatch, and a small effect of a gender mismatch. These differences are discussed with reference to how words are stored in the lexicon and how they are represented during sentence processing. * 1...|$|R

5000|$|However, in May 2016 it was {{announced}} that Devon's role was to be axed. The decision came days after she had criticized the government's testing regime in schools at the <b>Headmasters</b> <b>and</b> <b>Headmistresses</b> Conference, where she had said: [...] "Time and time again over recent years, young people - and the people who teach them - have spoken out about how a rigorous culture of testing and academic pressure is detrimental to their mental health. At one end of the scale we've got four-year-olds being tested, {{at the other end of}} the scale we've got teenagers leaving school and facing the prospect of leaving university with record amounts of debt. Anxiety is the fastest growing illness in under-21s. These things are not a coincidence." [...] The BBC reported that the DfE denied that Devon was being silenced because of her criticism, quoting the department as saying that an 'independent NHS task force report' published in February 2016 had 'recommended that a cross-government mental health champion be created. For this reason we have had to reconsider the department's own role' and that Devon's position was being axed to avoid 'confusion'. Devon emphasised that while she had carried out her role unpaid to maintain her independence of the government, the new appointee would be salaried and could [...] "be paid effectively to toe the party line".|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine headmasters’ and headmistresses’ roles in facilitating {{learning}} organization and their perceptions of transformational leadership in primary schools. The study also examined the relationship between the headmasters’ and headmistresses’ perceptions of transformational leadership and their roles in facilitating learning organization. A survey method was used to collect data from 41 <b>headmasters</b> <b>and</b> <b>headmistresses</b> who were pursuing Bachelor degree programme in Educational Management. Organizational learning questionnaire developed by Silins, Zarins and Mulford (2002) was used to measure the roles of <b>headmasters</b> <b>and</b> <b>headmistresses</b> in facilitating learning organization, while transformational leadership questionnaire developed by Leithwood and Jantzi (1996, 1997) was used to assess leadership. Means and Pearson product correlations were used to analyze the data. Major results of this study showed that <b>headmasters</b> <b>and</b> <b>headmistresses</b> have high perceptions of learning organization and transformation leadership. Overall, transformational leadership indicated high and significant correlation with overall learning organization. Each dimension of transformational leadership indicated high and significant correlation with overall learning organization.

40|$|From Chapter 1 : At the 1956 Conference of <b>Headmasters</b> <b>and</b> <b>Headmistresses</b> of Private Schools of South Africa {{a motion}} was {{introduced}} proposing {{that the term}} 'private school' {{in the title of}} the Conference should be replaced by that of 'independent school'.

This might well have been the case, but the proposer of this motion was no doubt aware that the term 'private school' was equally difficult and misleading. The first problem with the term 'private school' is historical.
