The product codes from the Harmonized System (<b>HS</b> <b>codes)</b> are the essential elements of the system's integration, automation and intelligence. The identified <b>HS</b> <b>codes</b> are well-accepted and precise product references used by customs authorities, to match applicable policies to the products being inspected and taxed.

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. Given {{the complex}} and often opaque nature of seafood supply chains, port cities can serve as checkpoints within supply chains to address illegal, unreported, and {{unregulated}} (IUU) seafood commodities. Harmonized systems (<b>HS)</b> <b>codes</b> are used at port cities by customs officials to monitor commerce. Concern about IUU activity in capture fisheries has focused attention {{on the role of}} <b>HS</b> <b>codes</b> in identifying data discrepancies between trading nations. Only 9. 9 % of the <b>HS</b> <b>codes,</b> however, are resolved at the “species” level, complicating efforts to deter illegal trade and improving product traceability.  To illustrate the useful role of species level <b>HS</b> <b>codes,</b> we evaluated the trading patterns of South African abalone (Haliotis middae) listed and delisted to/from Appendix III of CITES in 2007 and 2010, respectively. Trade data from the International Trade Commission (ITC) was used to analyze trading patterns of H. middae between Hong Kong (HK) and sub-Saharan African nations. Trade data analysis from 2002 to 2015 revealed 1) increased volume of product received in HK, 2) increased dried product over frozen or fresh, and 3) increased trade volume from outside South African borders. In comparison to stable patterns prior to 2007 during an era of higher enforcement, post 2007 trends are suggestive of IUU activity of H. middae and the need for greater scrutiny to prevent illegal trading. This study illustrates that improved <b>HS</b> <b>codes</b> can strengthen Trade Data Analysis (TDA) for identifying IUU products and improve traceability and transparency of seafood traded from developing to developed countries...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how language attitudes affect linguistic stratification {{and language}} use among Moroccan youth. The language situation in urban Morocco offers a unique venue for exploring how different linguistic codes, be they exogenous or endogenous, are represented and seek legitimacy and presence in contested and negotiated social domains. This dissertation brings a current understanding of language practices among youth in Morocco {{and contributes to}} a broader understanding of the sociolinguistic situation in Morocco and in the Arab world. Focus group participants use different discursive strategies to contest or rationalize the hegemonic discourse of modernity that shapes and is shaped by their language attitudes that they project toward different languages in Morocco. Studies on language attitudes have traditionally argued for aligning languages through covert and overt prestige, where local languages represent aspects of local culture, while the outward projection of social mobility motivates the acquisition {{and use of the}} transplanted varieties (Labov 1972; Trudgill 1983; Bentahila 1983; Marley 2004). Using a matched guise test, this dissertation broadens the scope of sociolinguistic research to analyze the covert language attitudes that shape the presence of <b>H</b> <b>codes</b> (Standard Arabic and French) and an L code (Moroccan Arabic). This analysis of covert attitudes shows that these languages are not uniformly distributed along the poles of status and solidarity but rather are competing for both. In addition to the investigation of language attitudes using critical discourse analysis and two matched guise tests, this dissertation contributes to the theoretical understanding of sociolinguistic research in Morocco by analyzing an overt language attitudes questionnaire. The main theoretical focus of the questionnaire provides us with an understanding of overt language attitudes, analyzed using diglossia and socioeconomic class stratifications, as well as reported language use, analyzed intergenerationally and by socioeconomic class. In spite of the maintenance of diglossia between local languages, namely Standard Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, and Berber, these results show how French and MA-French codeswitching permeate into lower functional domains, which undermine the presence of local languages. The results of this dissertation show that different data methods produce different results; therefore, the theoretical contribution of this dissertation is that more than one method of data collection must be used in order to validate a theory and more than one method of data analysis must be investigated before making any theoretical claims. The second theoretical contribution of this dissertation is that L codes do not hold exclusive appropriation to L domains. While MA and Berber in L domains are maintained through diglossia, which prevents the <b>H</b> <b>code</b> of SA from entering these domains, French has started to negotiate its presence in these L domains. This dissertation challenges the theoretical assumption that allocates <b>H</b> <b>codes</b> to the projection of overt prestige and L codes solely to solidarity, by testing covert attitudes within a pilot Matched Guise Test between SA and French, two <b>H</b> <b>codes,</b> and then adding the L code of MA to further test the relationship between the L and <b>H</b> <b>codes</b> in terms of status and solidarity. The empirical results of this dissertation challenge the conceptual understanding of language attitudes in Morocco and show a stratified outlook of these attitudes, divided along socioeconomic class lines. Thus, using data from Matched Guise Tests, a language attitudes questionnaire, and a focus group, this study reanalyzes the motivations behind the current attitudinal distribution toward different languages in Morocco, as well as the functional stratification these codes in various social domains...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, a growing concern {{developed}} around the trade of equipment designed for nuclear use and nuclear-related dual-use items that may be diverted to non-peaceful uses. Trade data sources and tools presented hereafter can enhance understanding of nuclear related trade from different perspectives. One perspective is nuclear safeguards. Since 2007, the Joint Research Centre has been supporting the IAEA in finding and evaluating collections of open source data on trade. We identified, and documented in a catalogue of trade data, sources stemming from declarations made by importers and exporters to customs authorities. Customs data are collected nationally, processed and published in transactional or aggregated formats by decision of individual States. Bringing these data together results in a large collection that creates a global geographical view on trade, covers all commodities, and reports trade in quantitative form over several years. The data are retrieved by Harmonised System (<b>HS)</b> <b>codes,</b> the taxonomy of goods designed and maintained by the World Customs Organization. <b>HS</b> <b>codes</b> introduce approximations {{in the description of}} the trade making the data of no immediate use to safeguards. Their use requires first mapping items of interest to safeguards verifications to <b>HS</b> <b>codes.</b> To this goal, correspondence tables have been developed by trade analysts and experts of the Harmonised System. To make these tables easy-to-use, we have designed and developed a software tool named The Big Table (TBT) which supports: (a) searching a collection of reference documents relevant to nuclear trade (legal documents and handbooks); (b) selecting items of interest to specific safeguards verifications; (c) mapping items to <b>HS</b> <b>codes</b> by means of correspondence tables. These steps are preliminary to data retrieval from sources on trade described above. These data sources and TBT are currently in use at IAEA¿s Trade and Technology Analysis Unit, for safeguards purposes. Other perspective uses of trade data pertain to the area of export controls. Potential uses include the estimation of trade flows of controlled items to inform the design of export control policies, as well as verifications on compliance with export controls regulations. In this paper we present firstly a collection of data sources on global trade. The paper will then tackle in some detail the first perspective, i. e. the use of trade data to support safeguards with a focus on the TBT software tool for nuclear trade analysis. Other perspectives on the use of trade data will then be briefly outlined. JRC. E. 9 -Nuclear security (Ispra...|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{the insight}} that trade data may support IAEA safeguards, a survey was {{conducted}} on world trade data available from open sources, resulting in a catalogue of web services on statistical and transactional trade data. Statistical data have a worldwide coverage and are provided, often for free, by international and governmental organizations and statistical offices. Services on trade transactions have a national or multi-national scope and are managed by companies. Trade data may provide information to support the verification of additional protocol declarations and nuclear material transfers as well as give indications of possible undeclared activities. Since trade data are retrieved by Harmonized System (<b>HS)</b> <b>codes</b> used by traders to declare goods to customs, a condition for using these data is to relate items of interest to safeguards with appropriate HS categories. The paper firstly reviews data services available on world trade with emphasis on type of data provided, geographical and temporal coverage. It then addresses the challenging task of correlating categories of items of interest to safeguards and <b>HS</b> <b>codes,</b> and presents a software tool developed for this goal.
