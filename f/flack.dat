5|$|The {{difficulty}} of using NVC {{as well as}} the dangers of misuse are common concerns. In addition, Bitschnau and <b>Flack</b> find a paradoxical potential for violence in the use of NVC, occasioned by its unskilled use.

Those who are skilled in the use of NVC may become prejudiced against those who are not and prefer to converse only among themselves.|$|E

5|$|Although Purkinje {{fibers and}} {{the bundle of}} His were {{discovered}} {{as early as the}} 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens, in 1906.

25|$|Not all was rosy for Gray however. He {{applied for}} extra gas coupons, {{reasoning}} {{that he would}} need them to drive about the countryside collecting plot material for the strip.
