40|$|Waste {{prevention}} and an {{efficient use of}} resources {{becomes more and more}} important in industry from both an economic and environmental point of view. Especially in forming processes such as deep <b>drawing,</b> <b>lubricants</b> are nowadays still an inevitable part to reduce the friction forces and to protect the tools against wear. Since cleaning of forming products is costly and time-expensive, a complete elimination of lubricants is desirable. Ultimately, the highest savings can be realized by a complete <b>lubricant</b> free deep <b>drawing</b> process – namely dry forming. In this paper, tribological optimization of dry forming tools for lubricant-free forming by means of a protective coating and micro-structuring of the tool is presented. While focusing on the improvement of frictional and wear properties, it is shown that ta-C coated tools operated in a dry environment can reduce friction up to 15 % compared to the lubricated case. Moreover, it is outlined that a micro-structuring of the tool by Direct Laser Interference Patterning technology can significantly reduce the tools wear...|$|R

40|$|The {{wire drawing}} process {{consists}} {{in reducing the}} diameter of a metallic wire by traction through a die. Wire <b>drawing</b> dry <b>lubricant</b> is a complex product not only considering the selection of raw materials, theirs formulation but also the manufacturing process. It can be assimilated to an elaborate mixture of mainly sodium and calcium soaps with mineral elements (fillers) and additives. The composition and the association of these elements allow the control of thickness and consistence of the lubricant film through the dies. Fatty matters mainly used for the manufacturing of these soaps are tallow and stearic acid extracted from tallow. Initially considered as a waste and questioned during the BSE crisis, tallow is nowadays on demand especially on the biofuels market...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} the results from numerical modelling and experiments to shed light on the mechanisms by which surface texture can reduce friction when applied to an automotive cylinder liner. In this configuration, textured features move relative to th e piston-liner conjunction and to account for this our approach is to focus on the transient friction response to individual pockets as they pass through, and then leave, the sliding contact. The numerical approach is based on the averaged Reynolds’ equat ion with the Patir & Cheng’s flow factors and the p- θ Elrod- Adams mass-conserving cavitation model. The contact pressures that arises from the asperity interactions are solved simultaneously to the fluid flow solution using the Greenwood and Tripp method. The experimental data is produced using a pin-on -disc set up, in which laser textured pockets have been applied to the disc specimen. Under certain conditions in the mixed and boundary lubrication regime s, both model and experimental results show i) an increase in friction as the pocket enters the contact, followed by ii) a sharp decrease as the pocket leaves the contact, and then iii) a gradual decay back to the pre-entrainment value. From the evidence obtained for the first time from the proposed combined modelling and experimental investigation conducted under carefully controlled conditions, w e suggest that these three stages occur due to the following mechanisms: i) a reduction in fluid pressure due to the increased inlet gap, ii) inlet suction as the cavitated fluid within the pocket <b>draws</b> <b>lubricant</b> into the contact, and iii) film thickness decay as oil is squeezed out of the contact. The interplay of these three mechanisms is shown to control the response of micro-textured surfaces under all lubrication regimes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study into the flow behaviour of lubricant in a reciprocating contact simulating a piston ring–cylinder liner pair. The {{aim was to}} understand the effects of cavitation, starvation and surface texture, as well as the interaction between these, in order to improve automotive engine performance. A custom-built test rig was used, in which a section of piston ring is loaded against a reciprocating, laser-textured, fused silica pad representing the liner. A fluorescence microscope focusses through the silica specimen onto the contact in order to image the distribution of dyed oil. Tests were performed using a range of texture geometries and orientations, under starved and fully-flooded lubrication conditions, with measurements being compared against those from a non-textured reference. Under limited oil supply conditions, the non-textured reciprocating contact sweeps oil towards the reversal points (TDC and BDC), leading to starvation and increased friction. This issue is alleviated by the presence of surface texturing, with each pocket transferring oil from the inlet to the outlet of the contact as it passes; the result being 33 % lower friction and oil distributed evenly over the liner surface. Even under fully flooded conditions, starvation is shown to occur following each reversal, as the change in sliding direction causes the cavitated outlet to become the oil-deprived inlet. This proof of cavitation-reversal-starvation, which occurs for up to the first 5 % of the stroke length, depending on the lubricant’s viscosity, corresponds to regions of high wear, measured in this study and on actual cylinder liners reported in the literature. This process is also counteracted by the presence of surface texture, with each pocket depositing oil into the cavitated region prior to reversal. Fluorescence data also provides insights into other mechanisms with which different textures geometries control friction. Grooves oriented parallel to sliding direction increase friction as they appear to connect the high pressure inlet with the low pressure outlet, leading to oil film collapse. Grooves oriented transverse to sliding direction produce localised cavitation inside each pocket, which supports the theory that texture <b>draws</b> <b>lubricant</b> into the contact through the ‘inlet suction’ mechanism. These findings can aid texture design by showing how pockets can be used in practice to simultaneously control oil consumption, and reduce friction and wear along the stroke. It {{should be noted that the}} lubricant transport mechanisms described above should also result from other types of depressions, such those produced by porous coatings (provided they are smaller than the contact area) ...|$|R

Especially in forming processes such as deep drawing, a reduced use of lubricants is highly promising for saving resources and reducing production costs. Ultimately, the highest savings can be realised by a complete <b>lubricant</b> free deep <b>drawing</b> process - namely dry deep drawing. In this paper, a combined approach consisting of a new tool design for deep <b>drawing</b> in <b>lubricant</b> free applications and development of a protective tool coating is presented. The combination of macro and micro structuring of the tools and the protective coating ensure a stable process with a sufficiently wide process window under dry conditions. Since the friction in the flange area and die radius has the largest contribution to the drawing force, these parts of the tool will be adapted for the new tool design. In order to decrease the level of friction force in flange area for a given friction coefficient, the integral of the contact pressure over the contact area has to be reduced. This is achieved by macro structuring of the tool. The absence of <b>lubricants</b> in <b>drawing</b> die radius has to be compensated by tetrahedral amorphous carbon ta-C films, which combine low friction coefficients and anti-adhesive behaviour with a high hardness and wear resistance. The ta-C films can additionally be micro structured by Direct Laser Interference Patterning (DLIP) to further improve their tribological performance...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to get an overall {{understanding}} for how different methods of chemical analysis can be applied for analyzing surfaces of weld wires in the welding manufacturing industry. Chemical components mainly focused on consisted of sodium (Na), potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) among other chemical elements. These chemicals are often introduced in lubricants, in dies and in coatings added to the wire surfaces in different phases of the manufacturing process. The reason for performing analytical testings’ during the manufacturing process is that the contents of these chemicals effects the welding properties of weld wires such as conductivity, feedability and arc stability during welding. Through controlling the contents of these chemicals on the wire surfaces {{it is possible to}} design welding wires featuring good welding properties, hence optimizing the welding process. However, the main focus of this thesis was dedicated towards studying the different analytical methods generally applied in wire manufacturing process and stayed throughout the project within the scope of this focus. Different analytical measurements were used throughout the analytical tests of these chemicals and consisted of flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Through interpretation of the ICP-OES analytical data, an overview regarding the lubricant content of Na, K and Ca present on six wire surfaces could be made. Additional analytical methods were also included in the project such as copper bath analysis which can be used for determining the quality of the copper plating solution whereas combustion analysis can be used for providing information regarding the content of organic material existing on the weld wire surfaces. Through applying these different analytical methods it became possible to obtain an outline of the general analytical methods applied in the weld wire manufacturing process and provided a basis for discussing the different analytical methods as well the importance of different stages in the manufacturing process. Data results obtained through the ICP-OES analysis can be used for providing information regarding the contents of lubricant rests and soap rests existing on the surface. The FAAS method is expected to provide similar information as the ICP-OES analysis; however results from the FAAS analysis were observed as inconsistent and did not correlate with previous analytical trials. Combustion analysis and copper plating analysis provide information regarding the content of organic material (C) and copper layer thickness of the surface. Correlations between the contents of different chemicals existing on the surface and the respective welding properties of weld wires were provided through welding tests and discussed with the assistance of chemical experts in the welding area. From the analytical trial analyses it could be concluded that wires with low content of carbon, sodium, potassium and calcium on the surface as well as an even layer of copper coating on the surface shows the best welding features in terms of high conductivity, good arc stability and good feedability. Important stages of the manufacturing process which has an effect on the welding features are the pickling process, <b>drawing</b> /application of <b>lubricant</b> process and the copper plating process. The different analytical methods used in this project proved to be good methods for providing information related to the content of chemicals existing on the surface and also provided good understanding of the chemistry which takes place in vital parts of the manufacturing process...|$|R
