5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{committees}} differ from their national counterparts as, although smaller in comparison {{to those of the}} United States Congress, the European Parliament's committees are unusually large by <b>European</b> <b>standards</b> with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff. Considerable administration, archives and research resources are also at the disposal of the whole Parliament when needed.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{destruction}} of the Armada, the Spanish threat continued; the castles in Kent were kept ready for action throughout the rest of Elizabeth's reign. In 1596 a Spanish invasion fleet carrying reportedly 20,000 soldiers set out for Pendennis, which was then garrisoned with only 500 men. The fleet was forced to turn back due to bad weather, but Elizabeth reviewed the defences and significantly expanded Henry's original fortifications with more up-to-date bastions, designed by the engineer Paul Ive. By the end of the century, however, most of the Device Forts were typically out of date by <b>European</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E
5|$|The power station's use {{of biomass}} since 2004 {{has been part}} of an attempt to reduce its carbon dioxide (CO2) output. In 2002 and 2004 the station met its targets for {{reduction}} in greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this, in 2006 the power station was revealed as having the fourth highest CO2 emissions in the north of England, for producing 2,685,512 tonnes of CO2 per year. However, generally the station reduced it CO2 emissions by 65% between 1990 and 2010, and the local air quality meets UK and <b>European</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the European Community (EC), eye {{protection}} requirements are specified in <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> EN 207. In addition to EN 207, <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> EN 208 specifies requirements for goggles for use during beam alignment.

Finally, <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> EN 60825 specifies optical densities in extreme situations.|$|R
5|$|Gjirokastër is principally a {{commercial}} center with some industries, notably {{the production of}} foodstuffs, leather, and textiles. Recently a regional agricultural market that trades locally produced groceries has {{been built in the}} city. Given the potential of southern Albania to supply organically grown products, and its relationship with Greek counterparts of the nearby city of Ioannina, {{it is likely that the}} market will dedicate itself to organic farming in the future. However, currently trademarking and marketing of such products are far from <b>European</b> <b>standards.</b> The Chamber of Commerce of the city, created in 1988, promotes trade with the Greek border areas. As part of the financial support from Greece to Albania, the Hellenic Armed Forces built a hospital in the city.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{qualification}} most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In {{addition to the}} European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of <b>European</b> <b>standards</b> for gyroplane, balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As {{a response to the}} perception that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA, the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via a badge system, pilots who meet those standards. Pilots working in sectors of GA that are commercial operations, such as aerial work and business aviation, are required to hold a professional pilot licence which, at a minimum, is the Commercial Pilot Licence.|$|E

It provides a means of specifying the capacity of an enclosure to protect its contents from external impacts. The IK Code was originally defined in <b>European</b> <b>Standard</b> BS EN 50102 (1995, amended 1998). Following its adoption as an international standard in 2002, the <b>European</b> <b>standard</b> was renumbered EN 62262.|$|R
