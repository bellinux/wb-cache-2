5|$|Characteristics of lava dome eruptions include shallow, long-period and hybrid seismic activity, {{which is}} {{attributed}} to excess fluid pressures in the contributing vent chamber. Other characteristics of lava domes include their spherical <b>dome</b> <b>shape,</b> cycles of dome growth over long periods, and sudden onsets of violent explosive activity. The average rate of dome growth {{may be used as}} a rough indicator of magma supply, but it shows no systematic relationship to the timing or characteristic of lava dome explosions.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Ryan Schott {{and colleagues}} made a more {{comprehensive}} analysis of cranial dome ontogeny in S. validum. The {{study found that the}} parietosquamosal shelf conserved the arrangement of ornamentation throughout growth, and that vascularity of the frontoparietal domes decreased with size. It also found that <b>dome</b> <b>shape</b> and size was strongly correlated with growth, and that growth was allometric (in contrast to isometric) from flat to domed, supporting Ornatotholus as a juvenile Stegoceras. They also hypothesized that this model of dome growth, with dramatic changes from juvenile to adult, was the common developmental trajectory of pachycephalosaurs. These researchers noted that though Williamson and Carr's observation that the supratemporal fenestrae closed with age was generally correct, there was still a high degree of individual variation in the size of these fenestrae, regardless {{of the size of the}} frontoparietal, and this feature may therefore have been independent of ontogeny.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} development from structures like these to more sophisticated domes {{is not well}} documented. That the dome was known to early Mesopotamia may explain the existence of domes in both China and the West in the first millennium BC. Another explanation, however, is {{that the use of}} the <b>dome</b> <b>shape</b> in construction did not have a single point of origin and was common in virtually all cultures long before domes were constructed with enduring materials.|$|E
40|$|A {{piezoelectric}} loudspeaker suitable for midrange frequencies uses a <b>dome</b> <b>shaped</b> piezoelectric actuator to a speaker membrane directly is discussed. The <b>dome</b> <b>shaped</b> actuator {{is made from}} a reduced and internally biased oxygen wafer, and generates excursion of {{the apex of the}} dome in the order of 0. 02 - 0. 05 inches when a rated drive voltage of 350 V rms is applied between the convex and the concave surface of the <b>dome</b> <b>shaped</b> actuator. The load capacity exceeds 10 lbs. The edge of the rim of the <b>dome</b> <b>shaped</b> actuator must be free to rock when the dome height varies to ensure low distortion in the loudspeaker. This is achieved by mounting the rim of the <b>dome</b> <b>shaped</b> actuator on a support surface by prestress only. An exceptionally simple design uses a planar speaker membrane with the center part of one side pressed against the rim of a <b>dome</b> <b>shaped</b> actuator by prestress from a stretched latex surround member...|$|R

25|$|Like most paper wasps, P. {{carolina}} constructs nests by chewing {{plant and}} wood fibers with saliva {{to create a}} paper-like material. When dried, their nests form an upside-down umbrella or <b>dome</b> <b>shape</b> with exposed honeycomb-like cells, opening at the bottom. P. carolina prefers to nest in protected spaces, such as naturally occurring locations in vegetation or the cavities of trees. They also frequently nest in man-made structures, such as the underside of bridges, roofs, eaves, and wooden boxes. These nests {{are some of the}} largest of any wasp species and usually contain around 3,000 to 5,000 members.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, in 1856, skirts {{expanded}} even further; {{creating a}} <b>dome</b> <b>shape,</b> {{due to the}} invention of the first artificial cage crinoline. The purpose of the crinoline was to create an artificial hourglass silhouette by accentuating the hips, and fashioning an illusion of a small waist; along with the corset. The cage crinoline was constructed by joining thin metal strips together to form a circular structure that could solely support the large width of the skirt. This was made possible by technology which allowed iron to be turned into steel, which could then be drawn into fine wires. Although often ridiculed by journalists and cartoonists of the time as the crinoline swelled in size, this innovation freed women from the heavy weight of petticoats and was a much more hygienic option.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples include}} the half-domes of the late 13th century tomb of Balban and the small dome of the tomb of Khan Shahid, which were made of roughly cut material and would have needed covering surface finishes. Under the Lodi dynasty {{there was a large}} proliferation of tomb building, with octagonal plans reserved for royalty and square plans used for others of high rank, and the first double dome was introduced to India in this period. The first major Mughal building is the domed tomb of Humayun, built between 1562 and 1571 by a Persian architect. The central double dome covers an octagonal central chamber about 15 meters wide and is accompanied by small domed chattri made of brick and faced with stone. Chatris, the domed kiosks on pillars characteristic of Mughal roofs, were adopted from their Hindu use as cenotaphs. The fusion of Persian and Indian architecture {{can be seen in the}} <b>dome</b> <b>shape</b> of the Taj Mahal: the bulbous shape derives from Persian Timurid domes, and the finial with lotus leaf base is derived from Hindu temples. The Gol Gumbaz, or Round Dome, is one of the largest masonry domes in the world. It has an internal diameter of 41.15 meters and a height of 54.25 meters. The dome was the most technically advanced built in the Deccan. The last major Islamic tomb built in India was the tomb of Safdar Jang (1753â€“54). The central dome is reportedly triple-shelled, with two relatively flat inner brick domes and an outer bulbous marble dome, although it may actually be that the marble and second brick domes are joined everywhere but under the lotus leaf finial at the top.|$|E

500|$|The {{breeding}} behaviour of the melampittas is only known in any detail for the lesser melampitta. All {{that is known}} of the breeding of the greater melampitta are reports from local people that it creates nests that are baskets of vines suspended in the limestone sinkholes that it roosts in. There is also some evidence {{that it may be}} territorial. The lesser melampitta is known to start nesting in the dry season and continue into the beginning of the wet. The nest is a closed <b>dome</b> <b>shape</b> constructed out of live green moss. The nest that has been described was found [...] from the ground {{on the side of a}} tree fern, with nesting material woven into the bark and attached to dead fronds of the tree fern to secure it. The female lays a single chalky white and slightly speckled egg, which measures , and undertakes all the incubation duties. The incubation is quite long for a small passerine, lasting around 27 days, during which the male will feed the female. Both sexes feed the single chick, which is hatched covered in downy feathers. Unlike their relatives in the birds of paradise family, which feed their chicks by regurgitation, the parents feed the chick whole food that has not been swallowed. The chick takes up to 35 days to fledge, a long time for passerines.|$|E
2500|$|Toubou life is {{punctuated by}} the seasons, divided between animal {{husbandry}} and agriculture. In the palm groves, some Toubou still live in traditional round huts built with stone walls bound by mortar or clay, or built from clay or salt blocks, with roofs of simple branches arranged in a <b>dome</b> <b>shape.</b> In the highlands, the buildings are built of stone, forming circles [...] in diameter and one metre (three ft) high, which serve as shelters for goats, or as granaries, or as human shelters and defense structures. In other cases, the Toubou live in tents {{that can be easily}} moved between the fields and the palm groves.|$|E
2500|$|Pachycephalosaurs, or [...] "thick-headed reptiles", have {{primitive}} {{features that}} include basally small sized bodies, bipedalism, and simple teeth with one row in operation {{at a time}} that are replaced as they are worn down. As they evolved, pachycephalosaurs evolved much thicker and advanced skull roofs including dome forms with horn-like ornamentation. Some research suggests these domes were used like helmets for protection while head-butting members within the same species. Some research suggests their necks were not strong enough to support such an impact. Flat-headed pachycephalosaur speciments have been found in Asia, and there is great controversy on the meaning of these flat heads. Recent research suggests the flat heads could be a juvenile state before developing the <b>dome</b> <b>shape</b> in the adult stage. It could also be evidence of sexual dimorphism with the female being more flat-headed.|$|E

2500|$|The marble dome that surmounts {{the tomb}} is its most {{spectacular}} feature. Its height {{is about the}} same size as the base building, about 35 m. Its height is accentuated because it sits on a cylindrical [...] "drum" [...] about 7metres high. Because of its shape, the dome is often called an onion dome (also called an amrud or apple dome). The dome is topped by a gilded finial, which mixes traditional Islamic and Hindu decorative elements. The <b>dome</b> <b>shape</b> is emphasised by four smaller domed chhatris placed at its corners. The chhatri domes replicate the onion shape of main dome. Their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb, and provide light to the interior. The chhatris also are topped by gilded finials. Tall decorative spires (guldastas) extend from the edges of the base walls, and provide visual emphasis of the dome height.|$|E
2500|$|The Memorial Chorten, {{also known}} as the 'Thimphu Chorten', is a chorten in Thimphu located on Doeboom Lam in the southern-central part of the city near the main {{roundabout}} and Indian Military Hospital. The chorten that dominates the skyline of Thimphu was built in 1974 to honour the 3rd King of Bhutan, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck (1928â€“1972). This prominent landmark in the city has golden spires and bells. In 2008, it underwent extensive renovation. This chorten is popularly known as [...] "the most visible religious landmark in Bhutan". It was consecrated by the Late Dudjom Rimpoche. This chorten is unlike other chortens as it does not enshrine the mortal remains of the late King. Only the King's photo in a ceremonial dress adorns a hall in the ground floor. The King, when he was alive, wanted to build [...] "a chorten to represent the mind of the Buddha". It is designed as a Tibetan style chorten, also called as the Jangchup Chorten, patterned on the design of a classical stupa, with a pyramidal pillar crowned by a crescent of Moon and Sun. The feature that is distinct here is the outward flaring of the rounded part to give the shape of a vase, rather than a <b>dome</b> <b>shape.</b> The chorten depicts larger than life size images of tantric deities, with some 36 of them in erotic poses.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{this highly}} {{interesting}} spot we stood awhile {{to note the}} peculiarities of the place and its position. The soil is a loose clay, deep-red or brown, impregnated with iron and, where unclothed with humus, cold and infertile, as the spontaneous aloe shows. The subsoil is laterite, also highly ferruginous. Soft and working well with the axe while it retains the quarry-water, it soon hardens by exposure; and, thus weathered, it forms the best and ugliest of the local building materials. Embedded in the earth's surface are blocks and boulders apparently erratic, dislodged or washed down from the upper heights, where similar masses are seen. Many are scattered, as if by an eruption; others lie in slab or <b>dome</b> <b>shape</b> upon the shore. The shape is usually spheroidal, and the material hypersthene (a hard and close-grained bluish granite) or diorite, greenstone-trap blackened by sun and rain. In the few cuttings of the higher levels I afterwards remarked that detached 'hardheads' are puddinged into the friable laterite; but I nowhere found the granitic floor-rock protruding above ground. The boulders are treated by ditching and surrounding with a hot fire for forty-eight hours; cold water, not vinegar, is then poured upon them, and causes the heated material suddenly to contract and fracture, when it can easily be removed. Magnetic iron also occurs, and specimens {{have been sent to}} England; but veins have not yet been discovered.|$|E

In formulating the solution a general conic equation is considered to represent the dome of circular, elliptical, parabolic and hyperbolic shapes. The numerical results indicate that the circular and elliptical <b>shapes</b> of <b>dome</b> give higher heat transfer rate and offset of the dome effects convective heat transfer quite significantly. However, beyond 0. 3 top dome offset, the change in overall heat transfer rate is not significant. In addition, the convective phenomenon influenced by a <b>dome</b> <b>shaped</b> cover results in establishing a secondary core region even at a moderate Rayleigh number when compared with an equivalent rectangular enclosure. A good comparison between the present numerical predictions and the previous published data is achieved. <br /...|$|R
