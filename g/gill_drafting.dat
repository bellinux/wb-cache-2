50|$|<b>Gill</b> was <b>drafted</b> by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats {{with the}} ninth overall {{pick of the}} 2014 CFL Draft. He opted to play one more season for the Bisons to get healthy, recover from a {{quadriceps}} injury and possibly increase his chances at being an NFL draft pick.|$|R

5000|$|Extensive {{material}} {{on the development of}} Gill Sans survives through records in Monotype's archives and in Gill's papers. While the capitals (which were prepared first) resemble Johnston quite closely, the archives document Gill (and the drawing office team at Monotype's works in Salfords, who developed a final precise design and spacing) grappling with the challenge of creating a viable humanist sans-serif lower-case and an italic, which Johnston did not have. <b>Gill's</b> first <b>draft</b> proposed many slanting cuts on the ends of ascenders and descenders, looking less like Johnston than the final draft did. Early art for the italic looked very different, with swashes on many capitals. However, Gill did not use the calligraphic italic [...] "g" [...] of his serif designs Perpetua and Joanna, using instead a standard [...] "double-story" [...] "g" [...] in italic.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gill</b> was {{immediately}} <b>drafted</b> into the first-team, replacing Peter Wakeham in {{goal for the}} remainder of the 1956-57 season, at the end of which Torquay finished as runners-up to Ipswich Town, missing out on the only promotion spot on goal average. In 1957-58, Wakeham was restored as first-choice 'keeper, with Gill as under-study, making only ten appearances as Torquay struggled, eventually finishing in 21st place and finding themselves in the new Fourth Division the following season.|$|R
500|$|A {{large amount}} of {{material}} {{about the development of}} Gill Sans survives in Monotype's archives and in Gill's papers. While the capitals (which were prepared first) resemble Johnston quite closely, the archives document Gill (and the drawing office team at Monotype's works in Salfords Surrey, who developed a final precise design and spacing) grappling with the challenge of creating a viable humanist sans-serif lower-case as well as an italic, which Johnston's design did not have. <b>Gill's</b> first <b>draft</b> proposed many slanting cuts on the ends of ascenders and descenders, looking less like Johnston than the released version did. Early art for the italic looked very different, with less of a slope and swash capitals. The final version did not use the calligraphic italic [...] "g" [...] Gill preferred in his serif designs Perpetua and Joanna, instead using a standard [...] "double-storey" [...] "g".|$|R
