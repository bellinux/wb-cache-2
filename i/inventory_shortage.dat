50|$|Back flush is {{used for}} {{materials}} which are required for the product and have a fixed relationship with it. Depending on how backflushing is implemented in the accounting software being used and depending on organizational rules, the back flushing may create error records which need to be analyzed by someone in charge for the cost accounting. One possible reason {{for the creation of}} these error records can be that there is no sufficient book inventory available in the designated back flushing location (shop floor). By simply deleting the error record, without working it out, could mean that the costs are not assigned correctly to products and/or even that the expenses in the financial accounting (inventory accounts) are not being recorded. The error record as such, is not a specific consequence of using back flushing. It may exist also when a MES system is being used when no back flushing is needed. The {{reason for this is that}} any error in transmitting and/or interpreting the data being sent by the MES system to the ERP system is consigned and needs to be worked out. When using back flushing, any scrap, material usage variance (using more or less than specified in the BOM) or substitution must be reported separately in order to maintain acceptable inventory accuracy. These are typically implemented as unplanned transactions. The downside of unplanned transactions is that they are prone to error. Unplanned inventory transactions must be eliminated and replaced creatively with planned transactions because even a very low percentage of misreported transactions will take inventory accuracy quickly to an unacceptable level. That is why the usage of backflushing is recommended only if 2 conditions are met: low I/O Variation and low Production Lead Times. Without low part I/O variation through low scrap, non-standard usage, and substitution, system inventory levels become unreliable. The exception transactions just cannot come through quickly or accurately enough to tame the beast. Loss of trust in the system occurs. Without short manufacturing lead times, components get moved into production but don’t get relieved right away from the ERP inventory. This leads to confusion. Evident discrepancies between physical and system inventory counts cause frustration and lack of trust in the system. Without accurate and timely inventory levels, internal production plans and external purchase orders cannot be scheduled effectively, leading to <b>inventory</b> <b>shortages</b> and excess <b>inventory.</b> <b>Inventory</b> <b>shortages</b> cause disruptions to the manufacturing schedule, forcing additional setups, forced substitutions, overtime, premium freight charges, missed shipments and lost capacity. Excess inventory increases obsolescence, and consumes precious cash flow and shelf space. Both excess <b>inventory</b> and <b>shortages</b> can indirectly lead to poor quality. A plant cannot cycle-count its way to accurate inventories. Cycle counting is not timely enough to be of benefit. And cycle counts are more likely to introduce errors than to correct them.|$|R
40|$|Price {{variation}} for identical cars at {{the same}} dealership is commonly assumed to arise because dealers with market power are able to price discriminate among their customers. In this paper we show that while price discrimination may be one element of price variation, price variation also arises from inventory fluctuations. Inventory fluctuations create scarcity rents for cars that are in short supply. The price variation due to inventory fluctuations thus functions to efficiently allocate particular cars that are in restricted supply to those customers who value them most highly. Our empirical results show that a dealership moving from a situation of <b>inventory</b> <b>shortage</b> to an average inventory level lowers transaction prices by about 1 % ceteris paribus, corresponding to 15 % of dealers' average per vehicle profit margin or $ 250 on the average car. Shorter resupply times also decrease transaction prices for cars in high demand. For traditional dealerships, inventory explains 49 % of the combined inventory and demographic components of the predicted price. For so-called 'no-haggle' dealerships, the percentage explained by inventory increases to 74 %. ...|$|E

A fuzzy SC model is developed to evaluate the performance of the entire SC and a genetic algorithm approach is applied to determine near-optimal solutions. The results obtained show that the proposed approach allows decision makers to perform trade-off analysis among customer service levels, product cost, and inventory investment depending on their risk attitude.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Navy Exchange Command (NEXCOM) Uniform Program Management Office (UPMO) {{is responsible for}} providing initial sales estimates to the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) for new uniform programs, {{as a part of}} a Supply Request Package (SRP). The SRP contains a fielding plan that projects sale quantities through the Navy exchange (NEX) outlets, Recruit Training Command Great Lakes, and the Reserve Component. UPMO also provides annual revisions to DLA that reflect changes to expected sales, due to policy changes. As the item manager for most uniform programs, the DLA relies on these sales’ forecasts provided by the UPMO. In turn, the NEXCOM sources these uniforms from the DLA for commercial sales through the NEXs. This project endeavors to develop an accurate sales forecasting model for use by the NEXCOM to support SRP development. Data analysis software will be used to identify relationships between uniform sales, time, manpower, and allowance data in order to build the model. Once chosen, the best candidate model will be validated against alternate sales data from a comparable uniform program. By using this model, the NEXCOM can provide more accurate procurement estimates to DLA, thereby reducing the risk of <b>inventory</b> <b>shortage</b> or excess inventory holding costs caused by overestimation.

As cross-functional and consensus-based processes, S&OP activities create value by keeping supply and demand in balance.

Accenture’s research and client experience confirms that this combined effort can help maximize a company’s profitability and accelerate its journey to high performance. Among other benefits, coordinating dynamic pricing, promotional and operational decisions will help reduce the costly bullwhip effect. In the bullwhip effect, small variations in orders get amplified up the supply chain, causing anything from <b>inventory</b> <b>shortages,</b> to lengthened lead times and lost sales, to decline in customer service.

Given {{the importance of}} these systems, many studies have been presented based upon the various conditions and assumptions (Moinzadeh and Aggarwal 1997). On the other hand, numerous studies have been devoted to the inventory control policy of multi-echelon systems with stochastic demands (Gumus and Guneri 2007). In this paper, a bi-product, three-echelon SC is considered which comprises r identical retailers, a central warehouse with limited storage space, and two independent manufacturing plants. The assumed network presents two types of product to the customers who arrived into the retailer nodes. Customer demands for each product j enter retailer i upon Poisson probability distribution function with rate λ ij [...]. Also, central warehouse responds the needs upon exponential probability distribution function with respect to the on-hand inventory. When a retailer places an order and faces <b>inventory</b> <b>shortage</b> in the warehouse, she/he waits up until product availability (backordering).
