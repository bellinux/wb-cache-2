Supplementary to the surface thermal information, geophysical data, geologic data, fault mapping, and other tools are used to characterize subsurface geologic structure and support drilling decisions. In the USA, however, the future growth potential in geothermal development that is indicated by national resource assessments (e.g., Williams et al. 2008) depends on development of new, yet undiscovered geothermal systems. Many of these may be ‘blind’ or have no thermal expression, fluid expression, or <b>geothermal</b> <b>deposits</b> at the surface. In other words, future growth in geothermal development requires that exploration techniques are adapted to current needs {{so that they can}} be, among other things, less dependent on information from surface geothermal features.

40|$|During {{the period}} May 28, 1978 to June 30, 1978, an {{intermediate}} depth heat flow borehole (1 - 78 -Ul) was completed on the Socorro Prospect, New Mexico. Rock types {{encountered in the}} hole ranged from unconsolidated Quaternary alluvium to clays and dense volcanic rocks. Depth of the hole was 1360 feet with the major drilling problems being sticky clays and hard rock. The geothermal gradient measured in this borehole was 2. 46 F/ 100 ft with an average thermal conductivity of 5. 9 mcal/cm-sec- C. The calculated heat flow value is 2. 7 HFU (1 HFU = 1 {micro}cal/cm{sup 2 }-sec). The linearity of the gradient for this hole suggests that heat transport in the shallow subsurface penetrated by the borehole is predominantly by conduction. Based on published data {{as well as the}} results of the present survey, a value of about 2. 5 HFU is probably representative of the background heat flow in the area of the Socorro Prospect.

On the other hand, Serbia is a country which largely depends on import of all forms of energy, which to a great extent affects its economic stability. Therefore, in Serbia the strategy for development of energetic was imposed and it considers all the aspects of development of energetic until 2015 and it also defines the priorities which can be mostly seen in the choice of forms of alternative sources of energy. These sources, based on some criteria, can be considered the most convenient for a gradual substitution of energy which is gotten from the conventional sources. Taking into account strategically defined goals and domestic potentials which are at disposal, as well as economic parameters, an alternative source of energy of basic importance for the future exploitation on the territory of Serbia geothermal energy, was chosen. The research points to the fact that Serbia will be capable to respond adequately to Kyoto protocol demands and to the European rules regarding the substitution of a certain amounts of fossil fuels by the fuel origin from the raw biological materials. The research defines the existent and non-existent capacities and the assessment of positive effects of usage of geothermal energy. At the moment, 160 long holes are being exploited whose water temperature is around 60 Â Â°C (140 Â Â°F) and their heat power reach 160 Â MJ/s.

The model was extended to include: a partial-length heat exchanger, the effects of the mixing of the fluid from inside the casing with that from the aquifer, and the effects on heat transfer coefficients caused by the scaling of the casing and heat exchanger. A parametric study of the system showed that the energy extraction rate from the heat exchanger is largely dependent upon: the temperature of the reservoir, the surface area of the heat exchanger, the ratio of the flow area inside the casing to the area of the annulus between the casing and the well bore, and the degree of mixing between the water from the aquifer and the cooler water from inside the casing. Flow measurements were made to verify the mathematical model. A hot-film anemometer was used to measure the convective flows within the casing but its use is greatly limited because the coating that protects the hot-film does not hold up at the temperatures encountered in a geothermal well. Construction of an energy balance around the heat exchanger in the well made it possible to estimate the convective flows within the well. Alternative designs for heat exchangers were examined.

In geosciences porous media research is fundamental in applications to aquifers, mineral mines, contaminant transport, soil remediation, waste storage, oil recovery and <b>geothermal</b> energy <b>deposits.</b> Despite their importance, there is as yet no complete understanding of the physical processes involved in fluid flow and transport. This fact {{can be attributed to}} the complexity of the phenomena which include multicomponent fluids, multiphasic flow and rock-fluid interactions. Since its formulation in 1856, Darcy's law has been generalized to describe multi-phase compressible fluid flow through anisotropic and heterogeneous porous and fractured rocks. Due to the scarcity of information, a high degree of uncertainty on the porous medium properties is commonly present. Contributions to the knowledge of modeling flow and transport, as well as to the characterization of porous media at field scale are of great relevance.

Drinking water contaminated with unsafe levels of arsenic {{may cause cancer}} of skin, bladder, lung (and possibly several other internal organs, including kidney, liver and prostate), and non-cancer effects, including manifestations that are distinctive and characteristic of chronic arsenic poisoning. The toxicity of arsenic {{is suggested by the}} MCLG of zero μg/L and a very low MCL OF 10 μg/L, that has been a subject of constant scrutiny. US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), based on the recommendations of National Academy of Sciences has revised the MCL from 1974 value of 50 μg/L to 10 μg/L. The decision was based on a National-level analysis of arsenic concentration data collected by National Analysis of Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA). Another factor that makes arsenic in drinking water a major issue is the widespread occurrence and variety of sources. Arsenic occurs naturally in mineral deposits and is also contributed through anthropogenic sources. Ground water with moderate (10 to 50 micrograms per liter) to high (greater than 50 micrograms per liter) concentrations of arsenic tend to occur throughout much of the Western United States. These high concentrations of arsenic are generally observed in the following geochemical conditions- basin-fill deposits of alluvial-lacustrine origin, particularly in semiarid areas, volcanic <b>deposits,</b> <b>geothermal</b> systems, and uranium and gold-mining areas. Arsenic occurrence in ground water is heavily dependent on various hydrogeochemical variables and land use. The occurrence of arsenic in high concentrations is common in Western United States, especially in the states of Utah, Montana and California and Nevada. In the current work, the dependencies of arsenic occurrence in ground water, on the various influencing factors like land use, aquifer types etc., is analyzed using the technique of ordinal logistic regression. Ordinal Logistic Regression predicts the probabilities for arsenic concentrations to exceed threshold concentration levels like Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) and detection limits, given a particular geochemical environment and human activity.

40|$|The Wind Mountain (WM) and Willard-Colado (WC) deposits, {{respectively}} of Washoe and Pershing Counties, Nevada, represent recent {{episodes of}} low-sulfidation, epithermal gold-silver mineralization. They have the principal features of amagmatic epithermal deposits including 1) young ages (3 ̆c 7 Ma), with Willard-Colado at 6. 03 ± 0. 04 Ma and Wind Mountain at a Pliocene or younger age, 2) absence of associated coeval igneous rocks, 3) development along range-front fault zones, and 4) proximity to modern <b>geothermal</b> systems. Such <b>deposits</b> in the Great Basin are generated by deeply convecting meteoric hydrothermal fluids that derive their thermal {{energy from the}} region 2 ̆ 7 s high heat flow and metals and volatiles from the traversed rock packages or shallow mantle. 	Hydrothermal alteration assemblages at both WM and WC are zoned outward from controlling structures along stratigraphic horizons and subsidiary structures, grading through silica, silica-kaolinite, kaolinite, and hematite-rich zones. Silicic and argillic alteration represents main stage hydrothermal activity; significant steam-heated alteration lithocaps are absent. Weathering-related, acid-sulfate fluids overprinted mineralized rocks at both deposits, oxidizing pyrite, remobilizing Au, and producing widespread hematite-goethite-kaolinite-alunite alteration. 	Gold mineralization is unique at each deposit but formed in several general paragenetic stages. Element maps generated by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry demonstrate that primary Au is in solid solution with pyrite or arsenian pyrite forming patchy concentrations and enriched rims. Secondary and possibly remobilized Au occurs as disseminated electrum and native gold along fractures in silicified rocks. Elevated concentrations of Ag, As and Sb spatially correlate with primary and secondary Au. A final stage is represented by gold in Fe-oxide/hydroxide rims on pyrite crystals or aggregates. The hydrothermal fluids at WM and WC dominantly consisted of meteoric water, based on their low δ 18 OH 2 O and δDH 2 O values calculated from quartz δ 18 O, kaolinite δ 18 O and δD, and calcite δ 18 O data and assumed temperatures characteristic of the epithermal environment. Black calcite prominently fills the range-front faults where at WM it displays a banded texture and contains acicular Mn-oxide inclusions and at Colado {{is part of a}} vein sequence grading from centrally distributed quartz, through quartz-calcite and calcite to distal gypsum. Calcite δ 13 C values {{are similar to those of}} igneous and some sedimentary carbon but distinct from values for tufas along the WM range-front fault and at Pyramid Lake. Alunite and gypsum have negative δ 34 S values indistinguishable from those of pyrite, as well as from H 2 S in the San Emidio geothermal fluids near WM. This isotopic correspondence results from kinetically inhibited, nonequilibrium isotopic exchange during the low temperature oxidation of reduced sulfur species. It is consistent with the surficial and near surface formation of gypsum, particularly at WM where lenticular gypsum beds are in stratigraphic proximity to sinter containing reed casts. Alunite δ 34 S values, combined with a psuedocubic habit and association with quartz, support an origin by weathering rather than steam-heated processes. The absence of steam-heated alteration at both deposits is likely related to a high water table during hydrothermal activity, which at WM was expressed by springs depositing sinter or gypsum. Collectively, the data for Wind Mountain and Willard-Colado are consistent with the amagmatic genetic model. Meteoric hydrothermal fluids circulating along range front faults assimilated C, S and potentially Au and other metals from organic bearing sedimentary±volcaniclastic and metasedimentary host rock packages and (or) sediments in adjoining Cenozoic basins. Although they lack a steam-heated alteration lithocap, such as those prominently displayed at the Hycroft and Florida Canyon amagmatic deposits, weathering pervasively altered the tops of the deposits following a substantial drop in the water table due to a change to a drier climate or uplift of the ranges due to local tectonism...|$|R
