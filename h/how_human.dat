What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed <b>how</b> <b>human</b> beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E

25|$|Despite its biological, {{ecological}} and cultural diversity, {{there have been}} few studies performed in the park area. For this reason, {{there is a lack of}} information about species, habitats and water flow. There is also relatively little information about <b>how</b> <b>human</b> activities affect the park.|$|E
25|$|The {{construct}} of nature connectedness is {{also related to}} a branch of psychology called ecopsychology. This branch seeks to examine <b>how</b> <b>human</b> well-being {{is related to the}} well-being of the natural environment. This theory is {{based on the idea that}} the needs of humans and nature are interdependent so human health will suffer if nature does as well.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{deficiency}} and toxicity can {{be either}} of genetic or non-genetic origin. The study of copper's genetic diseases, which {{are the focus of}} intense international research activity, has shed insight into <b>how</b> <b>human</b> bodies use copper, and why it is important as an essential micronutrient. The studies have also resulted in successful treatments for genetic copper excess conditions, enabling patients whose lives were once jeopardized to live long and productive lives.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{widespread}} belief, {{there is}} no empirical knowledge concerning extraterrestrial life forms and civilizations. The implications of a detection of extraterrestrial life would vary greatly depending {{on the nature of}} that life, its location, and <b>how</b> <b>human</b> society reacts. Because of this lack of certainty, PDPs consider a variety of scenarios and the appropriate reactions. The formulation of a cohesive plan for a response to the detection of ETI would involve the development of scenario-contingent strategies for managing the discovery and its consequences.|$|E
25|$|Measuring exergy {{requires}} {{the evaluation of}} a system’s reference state environment. With respect to the applications of exergy on natural resource utilization, the process of quantifying a system {{requires the}} assignment of value (both utilized and potential) to resources that are not always easily dissected into typical cost-benefit terms. However, to fully realize the potential of a system to do work, {{it is becoming increasingly}} imperative to understand exergetic potential of natural resources, and <b>how</b> <b>human</b> interference alters this potential.|$|E
25|$|Speech {{perception}} {{is the process}} by which the sounds of language are heard, interpreted and understood. The study of speech {{perception is}} closely linked to the fields of phonology and phonetics in linguistics and cognitive psychology and perception in psychology. Research in speech perception seeks to understand <b>how</b> <b>human</b> listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand spoken language. Speech perception research has applications in building computer systems that can recognize speech, in improving speech recognition for hearing- and language-impaired listeners, and in foreign-language teaching.|$|E

25|$|Invariant {{representations}} {{has been}} incorporated into several learning architectures, such as neocognitrons. Most of these architectures, however, provided invariance through custom-designed features or properties of architecture itself. While it helps {{to take into account}} some sorts of transformations, such as translations, it is very nontrivial to accommodate for other sorts of transformations, such as 3D rotations and changing facial expressions. M-Theory provides a framework of how such transformations can be learned. In addition to higher flexibility, this theory also suggests <b>how</b> <b>human</b> brain may have similar capabilities.|$|E
25|$|If left in {{the dark}} for a period of time, {{goldfish}} gradually change colour until they are almost gray. Goldfish produce pigment in response to light, in a similar manner to <b>how</b> <b>human</b> skin becomes tanned in the sun. Fish have cells called chromatophores that produce pigments which reflect light, and give the fish colouration. The colour of a goldfish is determined by which pigments are in the cells, how many pigment molecules there are, and whether the pigment is grouped inside the cell or is spaced throughout the cytoplasm.|$|E
25|$|The {{institute}} {{specializes in}} language comprehension, language production, language acquisition, language and genetics, and {{the relation between}} language and cognition. Its mission is to undertake basic research into the psychological,social and biological foundations of language. The goal is to understand <b>how</b> <b>human</b> minds and brains process language, how language interacts with other aspects of mind, and how to learn languages of quite different types. The MPI for Psycholinguistics is a globally recognized center of linguistics and presents with its international archive of endangered languages {{a significant contribution to}} the preservation of the common heritage of mankind. This archive is sponsored since 2000 by the Volkswagen Foundation and offers on the internet about 50 projects.|$|E
