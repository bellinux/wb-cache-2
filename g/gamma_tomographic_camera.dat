40|$|Successful {{treatment}} of myocardial infarction requires anearly and accurate diagnosis. Recent {{studies have shown}} thatacute myocardial scintigraphy has a high predictive value forprognosis of myocardial events. Three dimensional (3 D) perfusion data obtained with SPECT are however very rare in theemergency department (ED). We have developed a mobile tomographic system for myocardialscintigraphy, {{which can be used}} in the ED. The objectives ofthe studies presented were:     To develop software and hardware for a mobile tomographicgamma camera system: the Cardiotom     To demonstrate that a mobile tomographic system can beused in a clinical situation     To evaluate the limitations of Ectomography when usingfiltered back projection for reconstruction     To develop a method of reconstruction that compensatesfor the incomplete data acquisition associated with theacquisition geometry of Ectomography Three prototypes of a mobile <b>tomographic</b> <b>gamma</b> <b>camera</b> systemhave been designed and built at the Division of MedicalEngineering, which all have been used in a clinical setting. The systems are based on Ectomography, a limited view anglemethod, also developed by us. Instead of rotating the entiregamma camera detector around the patient as in SPECT, a slanthole collimator is rotated in front of a stationary detector. Since short imaging times are important in the ED and the heartonly occupies a small area of the detector, system sensitivityhas been increased by dividing the collimator into segmentswith different projection directions. In myocardial imaging, 4 segments are used and within 10 minutes from the start ofacquisition, reconstructed short axis view sections areavailable for interpretation. Using the Cardiotom in an experimental animal study, weverified that the system could be used to quantify myocardialarea at risk and final infarct size. This conclusion was madefrom a comparison of images obtained from the Cardiotom andpathological staining of the myocardium, analysedpost-mortem. Inherent limitations of Ectomography were evaluated withboth phantom studies and computer simulated data, reconstructedusing filtered back-projection Results show that moderatedeviation from optimal position of the detector with respect tothe myocardium will have little or no influence on thediagnostic information when assessed from short axis sectionimages and polar tomograms. However, long axis section imagesappear elongated when reconstructed using filteredback-projection. We have shown that this elongation distortion can besuppressed using iterative reconstructions techniques, and wehave implemented such an algorithm, called three-dimensionalTotal Variation Expectation Maximisation (3 DTV-EM). Resultswere that elongation distortion was reduced and depthresolution improved. The reconstruction technique was alsoevaluated for SPECT reconstruction and was found to decreasethe noise in reconstructed images, when compared to thetwo-dimensional TV-EM algorithm. Noise pattern were also foundto be more uniform for the 3 DTV-EM algorithm compared totwo-dimensional TV-EM. In conclusion, we have shown that the Cardiotom may beuseful in a clinical acute setting, providing valuablediagnostic information. Rapid positioning is possible, sincemoderate deviation from optimal positioning will cause few orno artefacts. Image quality can be improved if iterativetechniques are used for image reconstruction instead offiltered back-projection.

40|$|From the {{historical}} perspective, nuclear medicine contributions to brain imaging {{started in the}} 1950 s with cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurements determined by the Kety- Schmidt method and inert radioactive gases. Inhalation methods with venous sampling initially allowed hemispheric CBF determination [1]. In the early 1960 s, intra-arterial injection methods with externally placed scintillation detectors first demonstrated the possibility of performing regional CBF evaluation [2]. However, these methods were used more as research tools in physiology than for direct patient care. The same was true for the pioneering brain PET studies [3]. At {{the beginning of the}} 1980 s, brain SPECT for perfusion studies became more amenable to clinical use. The first tomographic images were obtained with krypton- 85 and a conventional gamma camera [4]. Even more encouraging, however, was the availability of dedicated <b>tomographic</b> <b>cameras</b> [5] and the first results using a stable radiopharmaceutical: 123 I-IMP [6 - 8]. However, despite interesting results, neuroimaging was still considered to be a research tool {{due to the lack of}} more widely available radiopharmaceuticals. Many nuclear physicians were still "neurosceptics"!

In a second paper (2), he presents a practical method to evaluate the index of resolution of focused collimators at any depth. The method separates the imaging process of the collimator into two successive steps: one step in volves the spread function resulting from one hole alone, and the second step involves the degradation of this spread function introduced by the multiplicity of holes. His results lack a rigorous theoretical foundation but are supported by experiments. They have been used in the evaluation of the <b>tomographic</b> <b>camera</b> (3).

A requirement {{of this method}} is accurate gamma attenuation correction. This is accomplished {{by the use of}} a constant density distribution for the drum content, thereby requiring the need for a homogeneous medium. The current predominant NDA technique is the use of the Segmented <b>Gamma</b> Scanner. <b>Tomographic</b> <b>Gamma</b> Scanning improves upon this method by providing a low resolution three-dimensional image of the source distribution, yielding both spatial and activity information. Reconstruction of the source distribution is accomplished by utilization of algebraic techniques with a nine by six voxel model with detector information gathered over scanning intervals of ninety degrees. Construction of a linear system to describe the scenario was accomplished using a point-source response function methodology, where a 54 {times} 120 matrix contained the projected detector responses for each source-detector geometry. Entries in this matrix were calculated using the point-kernal shielding code QAD-CGGP. Validation was performed using the MCNP photon transport code.

Rods with significantly less fission gas in the plenum may then be identified as leakers. Results for rods with low fission gas release may, however, in some cases be inconclusive since these rods will already have a weak contribution to the measured gamma-ray intensities and for such rods there is a risk that a further decrease in fission gas content due to a leak may not be detectable.

40|$|Requirements for {{effective}} safeguards {{during the transition}} to environmental management at nuclear material production facilities within the DOE complex are deriving improvements in the accuracy of nondestructive assay (NDA) techniques. An {{important aspect of the}} transition is the need for facilities to terminate safeguards on waste materials, thus reducing the cost for safeguards at the facility. Requirements for the termination of safeguards on candidate waste material have been established by DOE to minimize the potential for diversion or theft of nuclear material. Because heterogenous waste and residue materials are stored in large containers such as 208 -L drums, conventional assay techniques such as segmented gamma scanning (SGS) that were developed to assay small samples cannot always provide accurate measurements. Consequently, facilities using the conventional NDA instrumentation may be limited in their ability to discard waste materials in compliance with DOE requirements.

Calculated effective dose was less than 12 mSv when no reinjection and less than 18 mSv when reinjection. ConclusionsWith reduced activities of thallium 201 (− 30 %) and effective doses between 12 and 18 mSv, CZT camera gives reliable high quality imagin...|$|R
40|$|Prior to disposal, {{nuclear waste}} must be {{accurately}} characterized {{to identify and}} quantify the radioactive content. The DOE Complex faces {{the daunting task of}} measuring nuclear material with both a wide range of masses and matrices. Similarly daunting can be the selection of a non-destructive assay (NDA) technique(s) to efficiently perform the quantitative assay over the entire waste population. In fulfilling its role of a DOE Defense Programs nuclear User Facility/Technology Development Center, the Los Alamos National Laboratory Plutonium Facility recently tested three commercially built and owned, mobile nondestructive assay (NDA) systems with special nuclear materials (SNM). Two independent commercial companies financed the testing of their three mobile NDA systems at the site. Contained within a single trailer is Canberra Industries segmented gamma scanner/waste assay system (SGS/WAS) and neutron waste drum assay system (WDAS). The third system is a BNFL Instruments Inc. (formerly known as Pajarito Scientific Corporation) differential die-away imaging passive/active neutron (IPAN) counter. In an effort to increase the value of this comparison, additional NDA techniques at LANL were also used to measure these same drums. These are comprised of three <b>tomographic</b> <b>gamma</b> scanners (one mobile unit and two stationary) and one developmental differential die-away system. Although not certified standards, the authors hope that such a comparison will provide valuable data for those considering these different NDA techniques to measure their waste as well as the developers of the techniques...|$|R
40|$|A near-wall flow {{characterization}} including {{measurements of}} instantaneous wall-shear stresses of a {{turbulent boundary layer}} (TBL) developing along a flat plate with zero pressure gradients has been performed by using two advanced particle based measurement methods. The experiments were conducted in the 1 m- wind tunnel facility of Göttingen at U_∞ = 10 m/s and a Reynolds number of Re_θ = 2, 770 corresponding to Re_τ = 960. First, high-speed 2 C-PIV was performed at two image magnification factors at 2 kHz and 4 kHz frame rates {{in order to obtain}} the overall statistical properties of the boundary layer profile together with a large time series of instantaneous 2 C velocity vector fields in a streamwise, wall-normal plane. Single pixel line correlation applied to the particle image area close to the wall provided high spatial resolution velocity data down into the viscous sublayer. In a second step, the novel 4 D-PTV technique Shake-The-Box (STB) was applied to a time series of particle images acquired with a typical <b>tomographic</b> high-speed <b>camera</b> set-up at 15. 873 kHz. The STB measurement domain consists of a wall-bounded volume covering a stream- and spanwise area of 430 x 430 viscous units (l^+= ν/u_τ) and a wall-normal extension of 32 viscous units. A comprehensive set of relatively dense Lagrangian track data was reconstructed from two time resolved sequences of 115, 000 time steps each. The data enables an accurate and very high resolution measurement of the mean and rms-velocity profiles averaged in bins sized by a fraction of a viscous unit, of both components of the instantaneous wall shear stress (τ^+_w) and all components of the Reynolds stress tensor. Furthermore, the time-resolved 3 D velocity vectors and corresponding gradient tensor have been interpolated onto a regular grid using the time series of irregularly distributed Lagrangian track data. With the present data coherent structures and their dynamics close to the wall can be investigated together with their role for various (rare) wall shear stress events. The STB method is proven capable of coping with strong velocity gradients close to walls and can also be extended to TBL flows with much higher Reynolds numbers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} design, construction, and {{applications}} of the optoelectronic swept-frequency laser (SFL). The optoelectronic SFL is a feedback loop designed around a swept-frequency (chirped) semiconductor laser (SCL) to control its instantaneous optical frequency, such that the chirp characteristics are determined solely by a reference electronic oscillator. The resultant system generates precisely controlled optical frequency sweeps. In particular, we focus on linear chirps because of their numerous applications. We demonstrate optoelectronic SFLs based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) and distributed-feedback lasers (DFBs) at wavelengths of 1550 nm and 1060 nm. We develop an iterative bias current predistortion procedure that enables SFL operation at very high chirp rates, up to 10 ^ 16 Hz/sec. We describe commercialization efforts {{and implementation of the}} predistortion algorithm in a stand-alone embedded environment, undertaken as part of our collaboration with Telaris, Inc. We demonstrate frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) ranging and three-dimensional (3 -D) imaging using a 1550 nm optoelectronic SFL. We develop the technique of multiple source FMCW (MS-FMCW) reflectometry, in which the frequency sweeps of multiple SFLs are "stitched" together in order to increase the optical bandwidth, and hence improve the axial resolution, of an FMCW ranging measurement. We demonstrate computer-aided stitching of DFB and VCSEL sweeps at 1550 nm. We also develop and demonstrate hardware stitching, which enables MS-FMCW ranging without additional signal processing. The culmination of this work is the hardware stitching of four VCSELs at 1550 nm for a total optical bandwidth of 2 THz, and a free-space axial resolution of 75 microns. We describe our work on the <b>tomographic</b> imaging <b>camera</b> (TomICam), a 3 -D imaging system based on FMCW ranging that features non-mechanical acquisition of transverse pixels. Our approach uses a combination of electronically tuned optical sources and low-cost full-field detector arrays, completely eliminating the need for moving parts traditionally employed in 3 -D imaging. We describe the basic TomICam principle, and demonstrate single-pixel TomICam ranging in a proof-of-concept experiment. We also discuss the application of compressive sensing (CS) to the TomICam platform, and perform a series of numerical simulations. These simulations show that tenfold compression is feasible in CS TomICam, which effectively improves the volume acquisition speed by a factor ten. We develop chirped-wave phase-locking techniques, and apply them to coherent beam combining (CBC) of chirped-seed amplifiers (CSAs) in a master oscillator power amplifier configuration. The precise chirp linearity of the optoelectronic SFL enables non-mechanical compensation of optical delays using acousto-optic frequency shifters, and its high chirp rate simultaneously increases the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) threshold of the active fiber. We characterize a 1550 nm chirped-seed amplifier coherent-combining system. We use a chirp rate of 5 * 10 ^ 14 Hz/sec to increase the amplifier SBS threshold threefold, when compared to a single-frequency seed. We demonstrate efficient phase-locking and electronic beam steering of two 3 W erbium-doped fiber amplifier channels, achieving temporal phase noise levels corresponding to interferometric fringe visibilities exceeding 98...|$|R
40|$|As complex {{radiotherapy}} techniques {{become more}} readily-practiced, comprehensive 3 D dosimetry {{is a growing}} necessity for advanced quality assurance. However, clinical implementation has been impeded by {{a wide variety of}} factors, including the expense of dedicated optical dosimeter readout tools, high operational costs, and the overall difficulty of use. To address these issues, a novel dry-tank optical CT scanner was designed for PRESAGE 3 D dosimeter readout, relying on 3 D printed components and omitting costly parts from preceding optical scanners. This work details the design, prototyping, and basic commissioning of the Duke Integrated-lens Optical Scanner (DIOS). The convex scanning geometry was designed in ScanSim, an in-house Monte Carlo optical ray-tracing simulation. ScanSim parameters were used to build a 3 D rendering of a convex ‘solid tank’ for optical-CT, which is capable of collimating a point light source into telecentric geometry without significant quantities of refractive-index matched fluid. The model was 3 D printed, processed, and converted into a negative mold via rubber casting to produce a transparent polyurethane scanning tank. The DIOS was assembled with the solid tank, a 3 W red LED light source, a computer-controlled rotation stage, and a 12 -bit CCD camera. Initial optical phantom studies show negligible spatial inaccuracies in 2 D projection images and 3 D tomographic reconstructions. A PRESAGE 3 D dose measurement for a 4 -field box treatment plan from Eclipse shows 95 % of voxels passing gamma analysis at 3 %/ 3 mm criteria. <b>Gamma</b> analysis between <b>tomographic</b> images of the same dosimeter in the DIOS and DLOS systems show 93. 1 % agreement at 5 %/ 1 mm criteria. From this initial study, the DIOS has demonstrated promise as an economically-viable optical-CT scanner. However, further improvements will be necessary to fully develop this system into an accurate and reliable tool for advanced QA. Pre-clinical animal studies are used as a conventional means of translational research, as a midpoint between in-vitro cell studies and clinical implementation. However, modern small animal radiotherapy platforms are primitive in comparison with conventional linear accelerators. This work also investigates a series of 3 D printed tools to expand the treatment capabilities of the X-RAD 225 Cx orthovoltage irradiator, and applies them to a feasibility study of hippocampal avoidance in rodent whole-brain radiotherapy. As an alternative material to lead, a novel 3 D-printable tungsten-composite ABS plastic, GMASS, was tested to create precisely-shaped blocks. Film studies show virtually all primary radiation at 225 kVp can be attenuated by GMASS blocks of 0. 5 cm thickness. A state-of-the-art software, BlockGen, was used to create custom hippocampus-shaped blocks from medical image data, for any possible axial treatment field arrangement. A custom 3 D printed bite block was developed to immobilize and position a supine rat for optimal hippocampal conformity. An immobilized rat CT with digitally-inserted blocks was imported into the SmART-Plan Monte-Carlo simulation software to determine the optimal beam arrangement. Protocols with 4 and 7 equally-spaced fields were considered as viable treatment options, featuring improved hippocampal conformity and whole-brain coverage when compared to prior lateral-opposed protocols. Custom rodent-morphic PRESAGE dosimeters were developed to accurately reflect these treatment scenarios, and a 3 D dosimetry study was performed to confirm the SmART-Plan simulations. Measured doses indicate significant hippocampal sparing and moderate whole-brain coverage. Thesi...|$|R
