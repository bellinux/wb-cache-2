50|$|<b>Gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> is an esteemed food fish, but {{catches of}} wild fish have been {{relatively}} modest, between 6,100 and 9,600 tonnes in 2000-2009, primarily from the Mediterranean.

However, intensive rearing systems were developed during the 1980s, and <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> has become an important aquaculture species, primarily in the Mediterranean area. Reported production was negligible until the late 1980s, but reached 140,000 tonnes in 2010, thus dwarfing the capture fisheries production.

30|$|At {{the same}} time, at the Neretva Estuary, {{a total of}} 234 adult <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabreams</b> were caught by {{gillnets}} and long lines. It was found that 63.4 and 33.2  % of the specimens were aged 1 + and 2 + years, respectively. The rest were 3 + (2.3  %) and 4 + years (1.1  %) individuals. Two spear gun fishermen were questioned and they caught approximately 570  kg of adult <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabreams</b> together (360 and 210  kg each fisherman, respectively). The structure of their catches was not completely scientifically verified and thus we relied on their estimation. Moreover, this estimation is also biased by the preference of spear divers for larger fish.

5000|$|The idea of {{creating}} a Danish fisheries museum with an aquarium came from the journalist Hakon Mielche in 1941. In 1962, a planning committee was formed in Esbjerg which soon led to the collection of artefacts. Building began in 1966, allowing the privately owned institution to be {{opened to the public}} in 1968. From the start, the museum contained a fisheries exhibition and a saltwater aquarium. A sealarium was added in 1976. In 1989 a start was made on an outdoor exhibition which was later extended. The museum established a research unit in 1994, followed in 2000 by the Centre for Maritime and Regional Studies (Center for Maritime og Regionale Studier), a cooperative venture with the University of Southern Denmark. In 1999, a five-storey museum building with almost 2000 m2 of floor space was inaugurated, housing a new permanent exhibition, a library, storage rooms, an archive and offices. Provision was also made for temporary exhibitions while the educational facilities were modernized. A new saltwater aquarium was installed in 2002 and a new [...] "sealarium" [...] (exhibit for seals) in 2013. The largest aquarium tank contains 100000 L saltwater and is home to species such as cod, halibut, conger eel, <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream,</b> greater spotted dogfish and thornback ray, while the sealarium contains 500000 L and is home to grey seal and harbour seal.|$|E
30|$|The <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> inhabits mostly {{coastal waters}} and {{estuaries}}. The fish recruit in lagoons and estuaries and later spread {{along the coast}} and islands. It feeds mainly on molluscs and crustaceans (Jardas 1996). The historical abundance of <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> in the Adriatic, based on data of composition of catch by different fishing gears, was low. In the period 1960 – 1988, the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> represented only 0.2 – 0.5  % of the catch with gillnets (Jardas and Pallaoro 1993). Cetinić and Pallaoro (1993) reported a similar low frequency (0.05  %) of <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> in catches of traditional rope-tramata nets.

40|$|<b>Gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> (Sparus aurata) and European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) {{production}} from aquaculture {{has been increasing}} since the 1990 s.

In this study we analyze if the rapid growth in the aquaculture production of both species has affected the capture fisheries prices of both species. In other words, we investigate if there is market integration between wild and farmed <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> and European seabass. In order to do this analysis, we use data from the main <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> and European seabass markets that are situated in Southern Europe: Spain and France.

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to investigate {{as far as the}} available data allow the conditions by which this increase in <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> abundance in the study area occurred and how it can be explained. It is obvious that the rapid increase of abundance of a single species in an established ecosystem without changing its balance is not possible unless there are some conditions met. According to the data in Table  1, 31 species were recognized in the samples. Species niche overlap analysis (based on abundance data; Table  1; Petraitis 1985) showed that overall, the level of overlap among the 31 species identified is small (41.7  %; P <  0.001). Moreover, it revealed that all the species have 0 – 1  % specific overlap with <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> while for the opposite, <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> overlaps significantly with only a few of them. In particular, <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> overlaps mostly with Rutilus basak (62.6  %), Ictalurus punctatus (23.4  %) and Mullus barbatus (23.4  %). It {{is interesting}} to note that all of them are benthopelagic and the first two species are freshwater fish, while the third is a marine species. This overlap results clearly show that <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> as a broad euryhaline species can affect both freshwater and marine species along the coastal areas. Moreover, it is also interesting to see that the diets of all four species include zoobenthos among others (Fishbase). The two freshwater species are practically omnivorous while the two marine species are carnivorous and all prey on zoobenthos among others. This explains the very low overlap of these species with the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> since they can utilize a broad range of food items (plankton, benthos, plants, nekton etc.) which the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> cannot. Therefore, if there is a competition for zoobenthos with the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream,</b> these species may rely on other food items. On the other hand, <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> since it feeds solely on zoobenthos, it is obvious that competes aggressively with other species that also prey on zoobenthos, hence the large overlap values. Another observation which was made is that the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> and the other three species (Rutilus basak, Ictalurus punctatus and Mullus barbatus) have similar trophic levels (3.3, 3.2, 3.9 and 3.3, respectively; see also Stergiou and Karpouzi 2002). The identified species (Table  1) exhibit a trophic level between 3 and 4, while only a few such as the I. punctatus exhibit values close to 4 since they are known also to prey on fish. This indicates that the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> interacts with a small number of species at the top of the food web of the area and thus, the competition is much less in relation to other species belonging to lower trophic levels.|$|E
3000|$|The <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> (Sparus aurata Linnaeus 1759, Sparidae) is a {{euryhaline}} and eurythermal perciform {{fish that}} inhabits the Atlantic European coast from Portugal to the United Kingdom, the Mediterranean and the Black Seas (Jardas 1996).

40|$|<b>Gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> (Sparus aurata) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} species of intensively reared fish in the Mediterranean region.

Little work has so far been directed at establishing the procedures for selective breeding in <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> at a commercial level, although genetic parameters calculated in other studies have indicated that there is a large potential for improvement in certain traits. Selective breeding of commercial <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> populations is constrained by aspects of the biology that complicate the production of genetic groups and the maintenance of same-age offspring populations.

40|$|The <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> is a protandrous {{seasonal}} breeding teleost that is {{an excellent}} model for studying the testicular regression process which occurs in both seasonal testicular involution and sex reversion.

We have previously reported that <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> acidophilic granulocytes infiltrate the testis at post-spawning stage, settle close to the spermatogonia and accumulate intracellular interleukin- 1 &bgr;. In this paper, we report several flow cytometry based assays which allow to establish the role played by <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> testicular acidophilic granulocytes and permits their quantification...|$|E
30|$|Species {{association}} analysis (based on monthly presence–absence data from Table  1; Schluter 1984) showed overall that the 31 species identified are not associated [VR index =  0.26, 1.14 <Chi square W statistic (= 1.299) <  11.07]. This {{means that they}} compete for their habitat which {{may be in the}} form of mutualism (competition for resources exclusively used by the species), competition (interference among species may cause occasional exclusion from the habitat) and predation (when there is a prey–predator relationship between species). The results show that the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> shows negative association with 12 of the 31 species (Table  1). These species are: Anguilla anguilla, Diplodus puntazzo, Gambusia affinis, Gobius geniporus, Gobius niger, Knipowitschia croatica, Labrus merula, Lithognathus mormyrus, Liza aurata, Liza ramada, Mugil cephalus and Scardinius plotizza. Again both marine and freshwater fish are identified as competitors for the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream.</b> In addition, all these species prey on zoobenthos among others and this fact is considered as the main reason for competition with the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream.</b> In favor of the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> {{is the fact that the}} competition is small in terms of abundance of most of these 12 species in the samples. The most important in terms of abundance are the Liza ramada and Liza aurata which, however, are omnivorous and, therefore, can utilize a broad range of prey (zooplankton, zoobenthos, plants, detritus, etc.) minimizing their competition with the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> for zoobenthos.|$|E
40|$|Farmed <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> is {{sometimes}} {{affected by a}} metabolic syndrome, known as the "winter disease", which has a significant economic impact in the Mediterranean region. It is caused, among other factors, by the thermal variations that occur during colder months and {{there are signs that}} an improved nutritional status can mitigate the effects of this thermal stress. For this reason, a trial was undertaken where we assessed the effect of two different diets on <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> physiology and nutritional state, through metabolic fingerprinting of hepatic tissue. For this trial, four groups of 25 adult <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> were reared for 8 months, being fed either with a control diet (CTRL, low-cost commercial formulation) or with a diet called "Winter Feed" (WF, high-cost improved formulation). Fish were sampled at two time-points (at the end of winter {{and at the end of}} spring), with liver tissue being taken for FT-IR spectroscopy. Results have shown that seasonal temperature variations constitute a metabolic challenge for <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream,</b> with hepatic carbohydrate stores being consumed over the course of the inter-sampling period. Regarding the WF diet, results point towards a positive effect in terms of performance and improved nutritional status. This diet seems to have a mitigating effect on the deleterious impact of thermal shifts, confirming the hypothesis that nutritional factors can affect the capacity of <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> to cope with seasonal thermal variations and possibly contribute to prevent the onset of "winter disease"...|$|E

This information would be useful for achieving optimal conditions for freezing these species and assessing their quality during frozen storage for commercial purposes. Scallop muscles and <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> fillets were frozen individually with characteristic freezing times that can be met in commercial practice of freezing seafoods. After freezing, the samples were thawed and their quality was evaluated. Fresh samples were analyzed as controls. Intermediate characteristic freezing times (i. e. 89 and 49 minutes for scallop muscles and 74 minutes for <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> fillets) caused more damage to cell structure of both species than the shorter and longer characteristic freezing times tested. Short characteristic freezing times (i. e. 19 minutes for scallop muscles, and 2 and 18 minutes for <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> fillets) reduced the thawing losses of both species compared to the longer characteristic freezing times (. e. 235 to 1000 minutes for scallop muscles, and 640 minutes for <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> fillets) tested. Freezing at short characteristic freezing times produced raw fillets similar in texture to the fresh fillets. Therefore, short characteristic freezing times (equal to or less than 19 minutes) are beneficial for freezing both species. Scallop muscles and <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> fillets were kept frozen for up to 301 and 340 days, respectively. Sampling was carried out at regular intervals on fresh and stored frozen samples. Storage time affected the integrity of infra-cellular organelles, reduced the water holding capacity, caused structural changes to myofibrillar proteins and affected the sensory attributes of both species. Frozen scallop muscles were in acceptable eating condition after a storage period of ten months, with most of the changes in bio-chemical and physical properties being pronounced after three months of storage. Based on the changes in taste scores versus storage time, it was assessed that the practical storage life of frozen <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> fillets was circa 5 to 6 months Cat+-ATPase activities for scallop muscles and a linear model that combines free fatty acids, peroxide values and protein content in centrifugal tissue fluids for <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> fillets, may be reliable methods for industry to use for assessing their quality during long term storage at - 22 °C.

40|$|Glucokinase (GK) plays {{a central}} role in glucose {{homeostasis}} in mammals. The absence of an inducible GK has been suggested to explain the poor utilization of dietary carbohydrates in rainbow trout. In this context, we analyzed GK expression in three fish species (rainbow trout, <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream,</b> and common carp) known to differ in regard to their dietary carbohydrate tolerance. Fish were fed for 10 wk with either a diet containing a high level of digestible starch (> 20 %) or a diet totally deprived of starch. Our data demonstrate an induction of GK gene expression and GK activity by dietary carbohydrates in all three species. These studies strongly suggest that low dietary carbohydrate utilization in rainbow trout is not due to the absence of inducible hepatic GK as previously suggested. Interestingly, we also observed a significantly lower GK expression in common carp (a glucose-tolerant fish) than in rainbow trout and <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream,</b> which are generally considered as glucose intolerant.

30|$|First {{and most}} {{important}} reason is the escapes from fish farms as evident from the records of cage net damages {{and the results of}} genetic similarities between the local population and French strains of <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> (Šegvic-Bubic et al. 2011). These escapes provide constantly the local population with new fish which due to the existence of vast amounts of food in the area in the form of shellfish aquaculture farms is concentrating in the region instead of distributing along the Adriatic coastline. To make the situation more complicated, ecological analysis of the existing data revealed that the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> is not facing a strong competition from local species and, therefore, the establishment of its population is successful.|$|E
30|$|A {{second reason}} {{should be the}} effects of global warming (Coscia et al. 2011), as {{described}} earlier for other fish species in Adriatic such as groupers (Glamuzina and Skaramuca 1999) and bluefish (Dulčić and Glamuzina 2010).

The <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> is a thermophilic species and an increase in sea water temperature as a result of climate change, could potentially enhance spawning and recruitment success, both in natural waters and fish farms (Somarakis et al. 2013).

30|$|The recent {{increase}} of the local population of <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream,</b> Sparus aurata, in three areas along the southeastern Adriatic Sea: Malostonski Bay (Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina), Neretva Estuary (Croatia) and Boka Kotorska Bay (Montenegro) and its adverse effects on shellfish culture by preying on Mediterranean mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, and the European flat oyster, Ostrea edulis, are studied. The results from {{the analysis of the}} existing information show that the main reason for the recent increase is the escapes from local fish farm which enrich the local population constantly with new gilthead sea bream. The existence of practically endless food {{in the area of the}} shellfish farms allows the concentration of the population in the region instead of its dispersion along the Adriatic coast. Moreover, ecological analysis indicates that the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> is facing a very low competition from other local species which enhances its capacity to further populate the region. While the impact on the ecosystem is not yet known, the socio-economic impact of the {{increase of}} the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> population is evident today.

40|$|Full-length cDNA {{sequences}} encoding the β-subunits of the gonadotropins GtHI and GtHII were isolated, cloned, and sequenced from {{a single}} <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> (Sparus aurata) pituitary using RACE PCR. β-GtHI and β-GtHII degenerate PCR primers were designed according to regions of high amino acid sequence homology between the chum salmon and the bonito β-GtHI or β-GtHII. DNA sequence analysis of the cloned PCR products confirmed {{the presence of the}} predicted complete coding region as well as 5 ′ and 3 ′ untranslated sequences. The deduced amino acid sequences of β-GtHI and β-GtHII from the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> were compared to GtH sequences from a number of teleosts. Seabream β-GtHI shows the highest homology to the bonito β-GtHI (76 %) and the striped bass (74 %), while seabream β-GtHII is 98 % homologous to the yellow fin porgy, 87 % homologous to the bonito, and 93 % homologous to the striped bass β-GtHII. Northern blot analysis showed the transcripts of the <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> β-GtHI and β-GtHII to be about 700 and 740 bases, respectively. During the spawning season, β-GtHI is expressed at higher levels in males than in females while β-GtHII is expressed at similar levels in both sexes...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} dietary taurine supplementation on the growth performance and methionine metabolism of <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> larvae. For this purpose, a growth experiment {{was carried out in}} which seabream larvae were fed upon rotifers supplemented with “blank” or taurine-enriched liposomes. A complementary trial was also done in which seabream larvae fed with live prey were subsequently tube-fed a solution containing a L-[U- 14 C] methionine with or without a taurine supplement. Results from the growth experiment showed that rotifers were successfully enriched with taurine, but no effects were observed on larval growth performance, survival or amino acid composition. Furthermore, dietary taurine supplementation did not result in an increase of larval taurine levels, a factor that may have been determinant for the absence of effects observed on growth performance. In the tube-feeding trial, results showed that dietary taurine supplementation led to an increase of methionine retention in larvae. These findings suggest the existence of an active taurine biosynthesis pathway for <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> during the larval stage. Hence, <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> may not be dependent on dietary taurine to maintain the taurine body pool, since it may convert taurine from methionine if required. Taken together, the results from this study indicate that dietary taurine supplementation does not seem to enhance the larval growth performance in fish species able to biosynthesise taurine during this stage, which {{seems to be the case}} of <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream.</b> However, this study also showed that in these species, dietary taurine supplementation may ultimately affect larval metabolism by increasing methionine availability for several important physiological purposes, contributing to a better understanding on the role of taurine during the early life stages of fish development...|$|E
40|$|Skin is {{the first}} barrier of defense on fish, which is crucial to {{protection}} against different stressors, including pathogens. Skin samples obtained from dorsal and ventral part of Sparus aurata specimens were incubated with Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida (a pathogen for this fish species), with Shewanella putrefaciens Pdp 11 (a probiotic bacteria isolated from healthy <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream</b> skin) or with both bacteria. The gene expression profile of nine cytokines (il 1 b, tnfa, il 6, il 7, il 8, il 15, il 18, il 10 and tgfb) was studied by qPCR in all the skin samples. The present findings revealed different patterns of cytokine profile in dorsal and ventral skin of <b>gilthead</b> <b>seabream,</b> which {{could be related to}} the influence and susceptibility to a possible infection...|$|E
