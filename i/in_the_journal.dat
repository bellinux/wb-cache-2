5|$|Ely Rabin and Andrew M. Gordon {{reported}} in 2004 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Journal</b> of Applied Physiology on {{their use of}} the Magic Wand to create vibrations in the left biceps brachia to study proprioception signals in humans related to fingertip contact on surfaces. Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper published <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>journal</b> Experimental Brain Research. They wrote that extension of muscles and sensory clues worked together to provide regional perception of the patient's upper extremity in a localized area. Rabin and Gordon later co-wrote a 2010 paper with additional authors in Neuroscience Letters and expanded on research incorporating use of the Magic Wand to stimulate the biceps brachia. They measured people suffering Parkinson's disease (PD) for proprioceptive ability while their subjects' biceps muscles were stimulated with the vibrator. In 2007, researchers published a paper <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>journal</b> Gait & Posture about use of the Magic Wand to help measure balance and postural sway. While testing their subjects' balance while having to deal with simultaneous vibration, the researchers attached one Magic Wand to each leg.|$|E
