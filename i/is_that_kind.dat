500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Douglas Avery, and was filmed in Monte Carlo in July 2000. The plot was loosely based on Martin Scorsese's 1995 crime drama movie Casino, with Minogue herself portraying a character using aspects of Sharon Stone's bored trophy wife. Dutch actor Rutger Hauer served as Minogue's on-screen mob partner and husband. According to Hauer, {{no one from the}} set—including the singer, and apart from Avery—knew he was appearing as a cameo. Regarding the on-screen relationship, the singer stated; [...] "In my opinion, the Rutger Hauer character is kind of like a minder or he's in charge of her, although there <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of strong sexual tension." [...] The artist wore three outfits in the video—a multi-coloured dress {{at the start of the}} visual, a black dress during her appearance at a casino in Monte Carlo, and a final blue cocktail dress. She had sported an estimated $2 million worth of jewellery and diamonds during filming, with a few security guards having to accompany her on the set.|$|E
500|$|The Punch {{serialisation}} attracted little critical comment; The Athenaeums {{literary critic}} thought the series [...] "may have escaped unnoticed amid better jokes". When the Diary was published as a book, Punch heralded {{it in its}} issue of 23 July 1892 as [...] "very funny", adding: [...] "not without a touch of pathos". However, apart from a warmly approving report in The Saturday Review, the book's initial critical reception was lukewarm. The Reviews critic thought the book [...] "admirable, and in some of its touches [...] goes close to genius", with a natural and irresistible appeal: [...] "The Diary has amused us from cover to cover". This contrasted with the negative judgement of The Athenaeum, which opined that [...] "the book has no merit to compensate for its hopeless vulgarity, not even that of being amusing". It questioned the tastefulness of jokes aimed almost exclusively at the poverty of underpaid city clerks, and concluded: [...] "Besides, it is all so dull". [...] The Speakers critic thought the book [...] "a study in vulgarity", while The New York Times, reviewing the first American edition, found the work largely incomprehensible: [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of quiet, commonplace, everyday joking in it which we are to suppose is highly satisfactory to our cousins across the water... Our way of manufacturing fun is different". Although details of sales figures are not given, Arrowsmiths later acknowledged that the early editions of the book {{did not have a}} wide public impact.|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Nolan {{directed}} and produced Dunkirk, {{based on his}} own original screenplay. The story is set amid World War II and the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk, France in 1940. During the year-long production of his first film, Following (1998), Nolan and Thomas hired a small sailing boat to take them across the English Channel and retrace the journey of the little ships of Dunkirk. [...] "We did {{it at the same}} time of year to get a sense of what it was like, and it turned out to be an incredibly dangerous experience. And that was with no bombs dropping on us." [...] For Dunkirk, Nolan said he was inspired by the work of Robert Bresson, silent films such as Intolerance (1916) and [...] (1927) as well as by The Wages of Fear (1953). Describing the film as a survival tale with a triptych structure, he wanted to make a [...] "sensory, almost experimental movie" [...] with minimal dialogue. Nolan said he waited to make Dunkirk until he had earned the trust of a major studio to let him make it as a British film, but with an American budget. Before filming, Nolan also sought advice from Spielberg, who later said in an interview with Variety, [...] "Knowing and respecting that Chris [...] is one of the world's most imaginative filmmakers, my advice to him was to leave his imagination, as I did on Ryan, in second position to the research he was doing to authentically acquit this historical drama." [...] Starring Fionn Whitehead, Jack Lowden, Aneurin Barnard, Harry Styles, Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Kenneth Branagh, Dunkirk was released in theaters on 21 July 2017 to widespread critical acclaim and strong box office results, grossing over $520 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing World War II film of all time. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote in his review: [...] "It's one of the best war films ever made, distinct in its look, in its approach and in the effect it has on viewers. There are movies—they are rare—that lift you out of your present circumstances and immerse you so fully in another experience that you watch in a state of jaw-dropped awe. Dunkirk <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of movie." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times lauded the film, calling it [...] "a tour de force of cinematic craft and technique, but one that is unambiguously in the service of a sober, sincere, profoundly moral story that closes the distance between yesterday's fights and today's." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 2004, the Wallflowers {{returned}} to the studio to record their fifth album, Rebel, Sweetheart. This time the band decided to record in Atlanta, Georgia, which is where their producer for this album, Brendan O'Brien, is based. O'Brien also contributed on guitar. Fred Eltringham joined the Wallflowers as their new drummer. Jakob Dylan wrote the songs, of which keyboardist Rami Jaffee has said: [...] "What I did notice <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of upbeat song with some pretty scary lyrics." [...] Dylan painted the album's cover art himself.|$|E

He never had believed that it need come to that; but, for an instant, when the president said he could wish him nothing better on his way home than a good railroad accident, it flashed upon him that one of the three alternatives before him was to skip. He had the choice to kill himself, which {{was supposed to be the}} gentlemanly way out of his difficulties, and would leave his family unstained by his crime; that matter had sometimes been discussed in his presence, and every one had agreed <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> the only thing for a gentleman to do after he had pilfered people of money he could not pay back. There <b>was</b> something else <b>that</b> a man of other instincts and weaker fibre might do, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> to stand his trial for embezzlement, and take his punishment. Or a man, if he <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of a man, could skip. The question with Northwick was whether he <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of man, or whether, if he skipped, he would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of man; whether the skipping would make him <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> of man.|$|R

6000|$|Few of the maxims for the {{enforcement}} of which, in [...] "Modern Painters," [...] long ago, I got the general character of a lover of paradox, are more singular, or more sure, than the statement, apparently so encouraging to the idle, that if a great thing can be done at all, {{it can be done}} easily.

6000|$|Not with entire {{approbation}} do I, for one, look on that eloquent individual.

Enough of balderdash these long-eared have now drunk. Depart thou; do some benevolent work; at lowest, be silent. Disappear, I say; away, and jargon no more in that manner, lest a worst thing befall thee." [...] Exeat Fiddlestring!--Beneficent men are not they who appear on platforms, pleading against the Almighty Maker's Laws; these are the maleficent men, whose lips it is pity that some authority cannot straightway shut. Pandora's Box is not more baleful than the gifts these eloquent benefactors are pressing on us. Close your pedler's pack, my friend; swift, away with it!

For many of us the word [...] "God" [...] first came into our lives to denote a wanton, irrational restraint, as Bogey, as the All-Seeing and quite ungenerous Eye. God Bogey is a great convenience to the nursery-maid who wants to leave Fear to mind her charges and enforce her disciplines, while she goes off upon her own aims. But indeed, the teaching of God Bogey is an outrage upon {{the soul of a}} child scarcely less dreadful than an indecent assault. The reason rebels and is crushed under this horrible and pursuing suggestion. Many minds never rise again from their injury. They remain for the rest of life spiritually crippled and debased, haunted by a fear, stained with a persuasion of relentless cruelty in the ultimate cause of all things.|$|E
