40|$|This article {{describes}} the current progress in thin bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric films (BLSFs) including SrBi 2 Ta 2 O 9 and (Bi,La) (4) Ti 3 O 12, particularly those developed {{in the last ten}} years. BLSF thin films can be applied to ferroelectric random access memories because of their durable fatigue-free properties and lead-free composition. We will briefly introduce epitaxial thin films grown on a variety of substrates. Because of the difficulty in growing single crystals of sufficient size to characterize the ferroelectric behavior in specific crystal growth directions, we will characterize epitaxially grown thin films to obtain basic information about the anisotropic switching behavior, which is important for evaluating the performance of emerging materials. We will then discuss the fiber-textured growth on the (111) Pt-covered Si substrates of SrBi 2 Ta 2 O 9 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 thin films. Because we expect that the spread crystal orientation will affect the bit-to-bit errors, we believe that the fiber-textured growth and the characterization technique for the deposited film orientation are interesting from a practical standpoint. Another specific challenge of thin film growth is the growth of a-axis-(polar axis) -oriented films. a-/b-axis-oriented films are characterized both crystallographically and by <b>electric</b> <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loop.</b> The hysteresis performance was in accordance with the volume fraction of the a/b domains; however, no evidence for 90 degrees switching of the b domain by an external electric field was obtained. The control of film orientation also allows systematic studies on the effects of a structural modification and relation between spontaneous polarization and Curie temperature, examples of which are given in this paper. After a short description of the piezoelectric properties, we will conclude with a summary and the future prospects of BLSF thin films for research and applications.

Until recently, the long-range ferroelectric order having an exchange-striction magnetic nature had {{been observed in}} RMn_ 2 O_ 5 only at low temperatures (T≤ T_C = 30 [...] 35 K). We believe that the polarization we observed {{was caused by the}} frozen superparaelectric state which was formed by the restricted polar domains resulting from phase separation and charge carriers self-organization. At some sufficiently high temperatures T≫ T_C the frozen superparaelectric state was destroyed, and the conventional superparaelectric state occurred. This happened when the potential barriers of the restricted polar domain reorientations become equal to the kinetic energy of the itinerant electrons (leakage). The <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops</b> were measured by the so-called PUND method which allowed us to correctly subtract the contribution of conductivity from the measured polarization. The correlations between properties of the phase separation domains and polarization were revealed and studied. The high-temperature polarization also had a magnetic nature and was controlled by the magnetic field because the double exchange between pairs of Mn ions with different valences (Mn^ 3 + and Mn^ 4 +) in RMn_ 2 O_ 5 was the basic interaction resulting in phase separation.

High temperature X-ray diffraction tests indicate that the cation order is embedded in the structural order. The solid solution ceramics appear to have a non-cubic paraelectric phase above their Curie temperatures. The competition between the antiferroelectric order in Pb(Mg 1 / 2 W 1 / 2) O 3 and the ferroelectric order in Pb(Zr 0. 5 Ti 0. 5) O 3 leads to the relaxor ferroelectric behavior in the solid solution.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{three-dimensional}} micromechanical model is presented for simulation {{of the rate}} dependent properties of certain perovskite type tetragonal piezoelectric materials. The model is based on linear constitutive, nonlinear domain switching, and linear kinetics theories. The simulation starts with a virgin bulk material of randomly oriented grains. Then the material is electrically loaded with an alternating voltage of various frequencies, which are {{in the order of}} 0. 01 Hz to 1 Hz. An energy equation in combination with a probability function is used to determine the onset of the domain switching inside the grains. Such a probability function leads to a better phenomenological model for the domain switching even for electrical loadings, which are in a range far below the coercive fields. The propagation of the domain wall during the domain switching process in grains is modeled by means of linear kinetics relations after domain nucleation. The response of the bulk ceramic is predicted by averaging the response of individual grains using Euler angles for the transformation from local coordinates of the grains to global coordinate. <b>Electric</b> displacement <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops</b> for different frequencies and amplitudes of the alternating electric fields are simulated. A simple micromechanical model without the probabilistic approach is compared with the one that takes it into account.

40|$|Ferroelectric {{thin films}} often exhibit a {{displacement}} of the polarization versus the <b>electric</b> field <b>hysteresis</b> <b>loops,</b> particularly along the electric field axis. This shift is typically attributed to structural and electronic asymmetry of the film-electrode interfaces, asymmetric surface fields, as well as space charge regions. In this study, we analyze {{the effect of a}} spatial, continuous distribution of space charge on the hysteresis response and phase transition characteristics of epitaxial (001) PbZr 0. 3 Ti 0. 7 O 3 thin films sandwiched between metallic electrodes on (001) SrTiO 3 substrate. Using a nonlinear thermodynamic model, we compute numerically the internal electrical fields and polarizations for several different space charge distributions both {{in the presence of a}} triangular external electric field and as a function of temperature at zero applied field. We show that space charge accumulated near the metal-ferroelectric interfaces can dramatically displace the <b>hysteresis</b> along the <b>electric</b> field axis such that the otherwise symmetric coercive fields E-C- and EC+ in a bulk ferroelectric related to each other through vertical bar E-C-vertical bar=EC+ may shift depending on the space charge concentration in such a manner that both EC-, EC+ > 0 or EC-, EC+ < 0. This gives rise to a very strong imprint. Our findings reveal that the presence of space charges in ferroelectric thin films results in significant changes in the phase transition characteristics, including a reduction in the phase transition temperature, smearing of the transition over a temperature range instead of a sharp dielectric anomaly at the bulk Curie temperature, and a reduction in the dielectric response compared to defect-free ferroelectrics of the same composition...|$|R
