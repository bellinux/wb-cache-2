The paper discusses the most suitable criteria for the creation of <b>dictionaries</b> (structures for <b>cataloguing)</b> aimed at evidencing the functional aspects of portable finds, as an instrument for the best interpretation of contexts.

50|$|The UNISIST {{model of}} {{information}} dissemination was proposed in 1971 by the United Nations. UNISIST (United Nations International Scientific Information System) {{is a model of}} the social system of communication, which consists of knowledge producers, intermediaries, and users. These groups of people (or actors) are different kinds of professionals. The social system also contains institutes such as research institutes, publishers, and libraries. The actors and institutions perform information services such as writing, publishing, storing and retrieving documents and information. The actors are communicating in both formal and informal ways and they are producing different kinds of documents such as journal articles, books, book reviews, proceedings, bibliographies and <b>catalogues,</b> <b>dictionaries,</b> handbooks, encyclopedias and review articles.|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} a {{brief review of}} the few Russian hydronymic catalogues (relating to the basins of the Don, Oka, Svir and other rivers) based on the hydrographic principle. The authors argue that, in comparison with alphabetized hydronymic <b>dictionaries,</b> hydronymic <b>catalogues</b> have some obvious advantages for onomastic lexicography. This kind of catalogues should include, firstly, all historically attested forms of a hydronym (including those considered to be occasional miswritings) and, secondly, all non-hydronymic names making part of the respective hydronymic microsystem and providing “external” (i. e., chronological, derivational, etymological, ethno-historical) information about the hydronym. The authors point out that the cataloguing of hydronyms based on the hydrographic principle entails some difficulties: impossibility to localize some bodies of water mentioned in ancient and medieval documents; differences in the indication of the same bodies of water on old and contemporary maps; historical differences in establishing hydrographic hierarchies; historical changes of lake-river systems, etc. The authors also share their experience in creating a hydronymic catalogue of the Msta River basin in Novgorod and Tver Regions of Russia. They describe the principles of the composition of the catalogue and present a short excerpt of it that orders names in the system of the Volma River, one of the Msta’s left tributaries...|$|R

40|$|In {{this project}} we adopt {{the role of}} a {{lexicographer}} confronted with the following problem; given a dictionary, can we build a thesaurus? In other words, can we use the information contained in <b>dictionary</b> defini-tions to <b>catalogue</b> words along with their synonyms. To do this we model the information contained in the dictionary as a network, with individual words viewed as nodes. We then build connec-tions between the nodes using the definitions of the words. These can be weighted or directed depending on how we interpret linguistic rules. We describe several approaches taken and how these led to our final method. We compare the final method to previous work on this problem and test the robustness of the method to noise in the original data. Finally, we develop some of the necessary tools that would be needed for the maintenance of such a thesaurus. The 1 st UK Graduate Modelling Week was organised b...|$|R
500|$|The myth of Actaeon {{is known}} to have been narrated in the Catalogue by virtue of a {{paraphrase}} found in a fragmentary dictionary of metamorphoses. According to the <b>dictionary,</b> the <b>Catalogue</b> included a variant of the myth in which Actaeon was changed into a stag by Artemis and then killed by his own hounds because he attempted to take Semele as his wife, thus angering Zeus, who had designs upon the woman. Before this testimonium appeared, another papyrus containing 21 hexameters related to the Actaeon myth was published by Edgar Lobel, who tentatively attributed the text to the Catalogue. As the fragment opens, Actaeon has already been torn apart by his dogs, and a goddess—Athena or, less likely, Artemis—arrives at Chiron's cave. She prophesies to the centaur that Dionysus will be born to Semele and that Actaeon's dogs will roam the hills with him until his apotheosis, after which they will return to stay with Chiron. At this point the papyrus is damaged, {{but it is clear that}} the dogs are delivered from a [...] "madness" [...] ( [...] , lussa, line 15) and begin to mourn their master as the goddess returns to Olympus. Merkelbach and West did not include this papyrus in their edition of the fragment, the latter calling it an [...] "incoherent epic pastiche" [...] which would cause the author of the Catalogue to [...] "turn in his grave if he knew that it had been attributed to him." [...] According to Glenn Most, some scholars believe that the text is Hellenistic, but it is demonstrably archaic, and at least a few classicists today consider it to be part of the Catalogue.|$|R
40|$|Language {{acts as the}} {{lynchpin}} of cohesion maintaining electronic conversations across {{social networking}} sites. Analysis of that cohesion facilitates the detection of linguistic patterns that initiate and compound hate speech in online environments. This research reports on analysis of hate speech in videos and asynchronous conversation using Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) within social networking site. Focussing on the architecture of language {{and the influence of}} social context, SFL facilitates the analysis of language in its temporal and contextual use. In applying SFL to the chosen corpus of texts the research team are building reference dictionaries of offensive words and reference catalogues for the clausal structures in which these words are used. The team is exploring the detection of and analysis of hate speech across conversation, that is across texts within social networking sites (SNS). In accumulating data that allows the expansion of <b>dictionaries</b> and clausal <b>catalogues,</b> the team is enabling the building of an automated alert system that scans texts as they develop independently and in their engagement with other texts across time. Overall, this paper outlines the application of SFL to texts accrued from SNS that exhibit aspects of hate speech associated with dehumanisation, details the analysis of visualisations of hate speech within developing texts and demonstrates the building of an automated alert system using SFL to detect hate speech across texts...|$|R
