25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
500|$|To be honest, {{one of the}} hesitations I had {{in taking}} on the movie {{is that it was}} a little like writing about the Beatles—that {{there are so many people}} out there who know so much about him and who revere him that <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> a {{minefield}} of disappointment. Frankly, that I was going to do something and that people who ... hopefully, when I'm done with my research, I'll be in the same ball park of knowledge about Steve Jobs that so many people in this room are.|$|E
500|$|Joe Kernan {{was adamant}} that Diarmuid Marsden {{did not deserve}} to be sent off and criticised players for pretending to be injured during the game. The player himself also {{disagreed}} with the decision: [...] "The umpire said I struck him but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> the man coming towards me and {{it was more a}} case of getting myself out of the way or protecting myself." [...] He added: [...] "I'd never been sent off for Armagh before and to be sent off in an All-Ireland final is hard to take. Hopefully I won't be remembered for that. And I wouldn't like to end the career on that note." [...] Kernan and Marsden contested the decision and subsequent ban, but the GAA's Games Administration Committee upheld the penalty. However, after taking their case to the Central Council, the ban was overturned.|$|E

500|$|On February 17, 2011, Owumi's regular driver did {{not show}} up to take him to practice. He then called his head coach, Sherif Azmy, who {{instructed}} him to look outside his apartment, where a violent protest was taking place. According to Owumi, a military convoy of 30 to 40 soldiers approached the hundreds of protesters and began to shoot into the crowd without warning. He recounted, [...] "There was nobody with megaphones telling people to disperse. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> them shooting. Not to the air or the ground. Just shooting at people. Bodies were dropping. It was happening a block away from my street." [...] Owumi witnessed the deaths of about 200 people during the day. Mercenary troops later searched his apartment for revolutionaries but did not harm him after he showed them his American passport and Al-Nasr player card. After the soldiers assaulted and raped his neighbors, Owumi unsuccessfully tried to seize a gun from them.|$|E
500|$|In the United States, {{the first}} three films in the Die Hard series were rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America. Live Free or Die Hard, however, was edited to obtain a PG-13 rating. In some cases, {{alternate}} profanity-free dialogue was shot and used or swearing was cut out in post-production to reduce profanity. Director Len Wiseman commented on the rating, saying [...] "It was about three months into it , and I hadn't even heard that it was PG-13... But in the end, it {{was just trying to}} make the best Die Hard movie, not really thinking so much about what the rating would be." [...] Bruce Willis was upset with the studio's decision, stating, [...] "I really wanted this one {{to live up to the}} promise of the first one, which I always thought was the only really good one. That's a studio decision that is becoming more and more common, because they’re trying to reach a broader audience. It seems almost a courageous move to give a picture an R rating these days. But we still made a pretty hardcore, smashmouth film." [...] Willis said he thought that viewers unaware that it was not an R-rated film would not suspect so due to the level and intensity of the action as well as the usage of some profanity, although he admitted these elements were less intense than in the previous films. He also said that this film was the best of the four: [...] "It's unbelievable. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> it last week. I personally think, it's better than the first one." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his transfer, Garland {{opened his}} stint with La Salle on December 15, 2012 in a road game against Bucknell, scoring 9 points in 22 minutes {{off the bench}} and {{recording}} 2 turnovers and 4 personal fouls. He did not {{take part in the}} team's earlier games because he was ineligible due to NCAA regulations regarding player transfers. In the game that followed, he posted a career-best 26 points as a bench player in a win over Iona. He also added 3 rebounds, an assist, and a steal in the 23 minutes he was on the court. In a seven-minute stretch in the second half, Garland scored 14 straight points. He said after the game, [...] "I used to do it in high school. It kind of felt like high school when I was out there; it just felt good". Garland, who led the Explorers in scoring, also received praise from head coach John Giannini. On December 22, 2012, he had another impactful performance vs Sacred Heart, with six assists in 31 minutes of play. This was also his first-ever start under Giannini. The coach commented about Garland, [...] "He's a very underrated passer. People think because he scored all those points in high school he's a scorer first and foremost. I think he's a very good passer". However, this would be his sole start in his junior year at La Salle. Garland was effective in the opening, First Four round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament against Boise State, finishing with a team-high 22 points and, in turn, scoring 20 or more points for the second time as a junior. After the game, Giannini told Garland, [...] "This is why I chased you all over the place, to win NCAA tournament games and see if you could be a great player". On March 23, 2014, against the Ole Miss Rebels, Garland made a scooping layup off the backboard with 2.5 seconds left in regulation to send La Salle into the Sweet 16 round of the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. The game-winner was known as the [...] "Southwest Philly Floater," [...] following Garland's post-game comments, in which he said, [...] "That's the Southwest Philly Floater, man. Shoutout to my Cousin Bern, shoutout to my Mom". He made the shot in spite of defensive efforts from the Rebels' 6ft 9 in (2.06 m) center Reginald Buckner, who had blocked the Explorer multiple times in the game. Garland recalled the play, saying, [...] "Time was running out, and I felt like I could get the drive. When I cut, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> an opening and took the ball up...I went in there and knew if I could get an open shot, I could make it". Following a defeat to Wichita State that ended the team's tournament run and their season, Garland was averaging 13.1 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 2 assists.|$|E

60|$|The city of Magdeburg is {{the only}} {{interesting}} object I have seen. I had a fair view of its cathedral, which I think, though not so imposing, yet as picturesque and beautiful as any I remember to have seen; and its old wall, too. We changed cars here, going through the wall into the city, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>just</b> {{enough to make me}} wish to see more; and now to-night we are in Leipsic.|$|R
2500|$|The {{look was}} created by Doctor Who costume {{designer}} Howard Burden who wanted to strip the Doctor back to the bare basics. His design was described as [...] "No frills, no scarfs, no messing, just 100% rebel Time Lord." [...] Capaldi said that the costume {{took a long time}} to find. The reason he settled on his final costume was because, [...] "I think it's quite a hard look. I always wanted him to be in black – <b>I</b> always <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> the Doctor in dark colours. Not tweed," [...] in reference to his immediate predecessor's original costume. [...] "Matt's a really young cool guy – he can wear anything, but I wanted to strip it back and be very stark." [...] He also described it as [...] "back to basics." [...] Moffat described the look as [...] "A stick-insect sort of thing". He also said that Clara calls him [...] "a grey-haired stick-insect at one point". Capaldi also stated that he chose the Twelfth Doctor's costume so fans of the show who enjoy cosplay could easily emulate it without going to great expense. Writing for Radio Times, fashion columnist Anna Fielding described it as [...] "a classic early skinhead look" [...] and linked it to Capaldi's history as a punk musician.|$|R
2500|$|Jeremy Sisto (Billy Chenowith) and Peter Krause (Nate Fisher) both {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of David. [...] However, director Sam Mendes had just finished working with Hall on the Broadway show Cabaret and called him one day at noon to invite him to audition {{for the role}} that evening. [...] Ball (who had worked with Mendes on the film American Beauty) said that, after four days of auditions [...] " [...] started reading, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> the character come to life. And it was David." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the incident, Donaldson commented: [...] "I'm a soldier, I'm trained to fight...it's {{instinct}} and it's natural. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> him there, I went over and got him, that was it." [...] The events were first reported by the Australian press on 12 December 2008 following a briefing by Major General Tim McOwan on 11 December. At this stage Donaldson was identified only as [...] "Trooper F". Donaldson then became the first recipient of the Victoria Cross for Australia on 16 January 2009; he was presented with the medal by the Governor-General at a ceremony in Government House, Canberra.|$|E
2500|$|Orson Welles noted Hayworth's {{problem with}} alcohol during their marriage, {{but he never}} {{believed}} that her problem was alcoholism. [...] "It certainly imitated alcoholism in every superficial way," [...] he recalled in 1983. [...] "She'd fly into these rages, never at me, never once, always at Harry Cohn or her father or her mother or her brother. She would break all the furniture and she'd get {{in a car and}} I'd have to get in the car and try to control her. She'd drive up in the hills suicidally. Terrible, terrible nights. And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>saw</b> this lovely girl destroying herself. I admire Yasmin so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our friend Hamilton," [...] {{answered}} the doctor, in reply to his question. [...] "I think he is, without exception, {{the most egregious}} nincompoop <b>I</b> ever <b>saw.</b> <b>Just</b> as <b>I</b> passed the long swamp on my way home, I met him crashing through the bushes in hot pursuit of a rabbit, the track of which he mistook for a fox. Poor fellow! he had been out since breakfast, and only shot a brace of ptarmigan, although they are as thick as bees and quite tame. `But then, do you see,' said he, in excuse, `I'm so very short-sighted! Would you believe it, I've blown fifteen lumps of snow to atoms, {{in the belief that}} they were ptarmigan!' and then he rushed off again." ...|$|R

[...] They looked like older men, with gray hair or white hair ... They had wounds on their heads, and there was blood on their clothes. [...] I didn't count them. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> looked and <b>saw</b> a lot of holes in the head - in the top of the head and the back of the head.

I was told there were other bodies further up and over the crest of the hill, and I was asked by journalists and inspectors if I was going to go up and see the rest. I said, 'I've seen enough.'" ...|$|R

60|$|As <b>I</b> looked <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>just</b> {{outside the}} harbour {{a thin line}} of {{cleaving}} water. This became more marked each instant, till a steel disc with glass eyes that shone {{in the light of}} the sun rose above the water. It was about the size of a beehive, and was shaped like one. It made a straight line for the aft of the yacht. At the same moment, in obedience to some command, given so quietly that I did not hear it, the men went below--all save some few, who began to open out doors in the port side of the wheel-house. The tackle was run out through an opened gangway on that side, and a man stood on the great hook at the lower end, balancing himself by hanging on the chain. In a few seconds he came up again. The chain tightened and the great grey crab rose over the edge of the deck, and was drawn into the wheel-house, the doors of which were closed, shutting in a few only of the men.|$|R

60|$|It is {{a figure}} that <b>I</b> once <b>saw,</b> <b>just</b> after dark, chalked upon a door in a little back lane near a country church - my first church. How young a child I may {{have been at the}} time I don't know, but it horrified me so {{intensely}} - in connexion with the churchyard, I suppose, for it smokes a pipe, and has a big hat with each of its ears sticking out in a horizontal line under the brim, and is not in itself more oppressive than a mouth from ear to ear, a pair of goggle eyes, and hands like two bunches of carrots, five in each, can make it - that it is still vaguely alarming to me to recall (as I have often done before, lying awake) the running home, the looking behind, the horror, of its following me; though whether disconnected from the door, or door and all, I can't say, and perhaps never could. It lays a disagreeable train. I must resolve to think of something on the voluntary principle.|$|R
