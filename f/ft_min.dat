40|$|Windage {{power loss}} in {{high-speed}} gearboxes result in efficiency losses and increased heating due {{to drag on}} the gear teeth. Meshed spur gear windage power loss test results are presented at ambient oil inlet temperatures both with and without shrouding. The rate of windage power loss is observed to increase above 10, 000 <b>ft.</b> <b>min.,</b> gear surface speed, similar to results presented in the literature. Shrouding is observed to become more effective above 15, 000 <b>ft.</b> <b>min.,</b> decreasing power loss by 10 at 25, 000 <b>ft.</b> <b>min.</b> The need for gearbox oil drain slots limits the effectiveness of shrouding on reducing windage power loss. Also, windage power loss is observed to decrease with increasing gearbox temperatures and to increase with oil flow. Windage power losses for the unshrouded meshed spur gears are 7 x more than losses determined from unshrouded single spur gear tests. A 6 x to 12 x increase in windage power is observed comparing shrouded single spur gear data with shrouded meshed spur gear data. Based on this preliminary study additional research is suggested {{to determine the effect}} of oil drain slot configurations, axial and radial shroud clearances, and higher gear surface speeds on windage power loss. Additional work is also suggested to determine the sensitivity of windage power loss to oil temperature and oil flow. Windage power loss of meshed spur gears tested in both the shrouded and unshrouded configurations is shown to be more than double versus the same spur gears run individually in the same shroud configurations. Further study of the physical processes behind these results is needed for optimizing gearbox shrouds for minimum windage power loss...|$|E

Current RLs, however, have been deduced from small or old multicentre studies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate current practices for patient radiation protection (RP) in French non-university public hospitals, which represent > 30 % of the national activity for ICPs, and 60 % of the emergency cases. MethodsRAY’ACT was a nationwide, multicentre survey. RP parameters from 35, 257 coronary angiographies (CAs) and 28, 604 percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) performed at 48 centres during 2010 and routinely registered in professional software were extracted and analysed retrospectively. Dose-area product (DAP), fluoroscopy time (FT), number of acquired frames (NF) and runs (NR), and cumulative dose to interventional reference point (CD-IRP) were analysed separately for CAs and PCIs (elective and ad hoc pooled). Emergency and complex procedures, associated with a high level of radiation, were not excluded.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{exposure to}} radiation during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) performed with intraoperative guidance by preoperative computed tomographic angiogram fusion. MethodsAll consecutive patients who underwent standard bifurcated (BIF) or thoracic (THO), and complex fenestrated (FEN) or branched (BR) EVAR were prospectively enrolled. Indirect dose–area product (DAP), fluoroscopy time (FT), and contrast medium volume were recorded. These data were compared with a previously published prospective EVAR cohort of 301 patients and to other literature. Direct DAP and peak skin dose were measured with radiochromic films. Results are expressed as median (interquartile range). ResultsFrom December 2012 to July 2013, 102 patients underwent standard (56. 8 %) or complex (43. 2 %) EVAR. The indirect DAP (Gy. cm 2) was as follows: BIF 12. 2 (8. 7 – 19. 9); THO 26. 0 (11. 9 – 34. 9); FEN 43. 7 (24. 7 – 57. 5); and BR 47. 4 (37. 2 – 108. 2). The <b>FT</b> (<b>min)</b> was as follows: BIF 10. 6 (9. 1 – 14. 7); THO 8. 9 (6. 0 – 10. 5); FEN 30. 7 (20. 2 – 40. 5); and BR 39. 5 (34. 8 – 51. 6). The contrast medium volume (mL) was as follows: BIF 59. 0 (50. 0 – 75. 0); THO 80. 0 (50. 0 – 100. 0); FEN 105. 0 (70. 0 – 136. 0); and BR 120. 0 (100. 0 – 170. 0). When compared with a previous cohort, {{there was a significant}} reduction in DAP during BIF, FEN, and BR procedures, and a significant reduction of iodinated contrast volume during FEN and BR procedures. There was also a significant reduction in DAP during BIF procedures when compared with the literature (p < . 01).

5000|$|A new {{approach}} to the inter-rack cabling was taken. A false ceiling was built above {{the top of the}} racks, creating a cable loft.

Unconfined water sprays operated at lower water pressures of ? 689 kPa (? 100 psig) can be very effective at wetting the mine product at the dust source and significantly {{reducing the amount of}} respirable dust that becomes airborne. However, unconfined waters sprays can be somewhat ineffective in actually removing airborne dust from the air. On the other hand, water powered scrubbers operating at higher water pressures of ? 1, 724 kPa (? 250 psig) in physical enclosures or ducts have previously been demonstrated to be very effective in removing airborne dust from the air. These higher operating water pressures are uncommon in many mines and mills, so their use is limited. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recently investigated the performance of a lower-pressure, water powered inline series spray scrubber for removing localized airborne dust emitted at the source. Results showed noticeable improvements in airborne dust capture efficiency through the operation o f multiple inline series hollow cone spray nozzles within a round duct or pipe at the same water pressure as a single spray. Operating hollow cone spray(s) at higher water pressures noticeably improved airflow through the scrubber and yielded some additional scrubber efficiency improvements.

5000|$|A {{particular}} {{attraction of}} magnesium alloys lies in their extraordinarily good machining properties, in which respect they are superior even to screwing brass. The power required in cutting them is small, and extremely high speeds (5000 <b>ft</b> per <b>min</b> in some cases) may be used. The best cutting tools have special shapes, but the tools for machining other metals can be used, although somewhat lower efficiency results. When magnesium is cut at high speed, the tools should be sharp {{and should be}} cutting at all times. Dull, dragging tools operating at high speed may generate enough heat to ignite fine chips. Since chips and dust from grinding can therefore be a fire hazard, grinding {{should be done with}} a coolant, or with a device to concentrate the dust under water. The magnesium grinder should not be used also for ferrous metals, since a spark might ignite the accumulated dust. If a magnesium fire should start, it can be smothered with cast-iron turnings or dry sand, or with other materials prepared especially for the purpose. Water or liquid extinguishers should never be used, because they tend to scatter the fire. Actually, it is much more difficult to ignite magnesium chips and dust than is usually supposed, and for that reason they do not present great machining difficulties. The special techniques that must be used in fabricating magnesium (working, casting, and joining) add considerably to the manufacturing cost. In selecting between aluminium and magnesium or a given part, the base cost of the metal may not give much advantage to either, but usually the manufacturing operations make magnesium more expensive. [...] There is, perhaps, no group of alloys where extrusion is more important than it is to these, since the comparatively coarse-grained structure of the cast material makes most of them too susceptible to cracking to work by other means until sufficient deformation has been imparted to refine the grain. Therefore, except for one or two soft alloys, machining is invariably a preliminary step before other shaping processes.|$|R

Bioinformatic analysis revealed an association of the altered proteins with the signalling cascades “regulation of haemostasis” (four proteins), “metabolism” (five proteins), and “leukocyte mediated immune response” (five proteins). Even though hypobaric hypoxia was short and moderate (comparable to an airliner flight), analysis of protein expression in human subjects revealed an association to immune response, protein metabolism, and haemostasi...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThis was a prospective, single-center study {{evaluating}} the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of early ambulation (within 30 min) following femoral artery closure with the ProGlide® suture-mediated vascular closure device (PD) in patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization compared with manual compression. BackgroundIt {{is unclear whether}} early ambulation with ProGlide is safe or is associated with patient satisfaction and cost savings as compared with manual compression (MC). Methods and resultsInclusion criteria were met in 170 patients (85 PD and 85 MC patients). Patients ambulated 20 <b>ft.</b> within 30 <b>min</b> (PD) or after the requisite 4 h recumbent time (MC) if feasible. Primary endpoint was time-to-ambulation (TTA) following device closure. We also directly compared the safety of closure, times-to-hemostasis (TTH), -ambulation (TTA) and -discharge (TTD) with MC and, using a fully allocated cost model, performed cost analysis for both strategies. Multivariate {{analysis was used to}} determine predictors of patient satisfaction. The primary endpoint of safe, early ambulation was achieved following closure (mean of 27. 1 ± 14. 9 min; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 25. 2 – 30. 2). Predictors of patient satisfaction in the PD group were absence of pain during closure, decreased TTA, and drastic reductions in TTD; the latter contributed indirectly to significant cost savings in the PD group (1250. 3 ± 146. 4 vs. 2248. 1 ± 910. 2 dollars, respectively; P< 0. 001) and incremental cost savings by strategy also favored closure over MC ($ 84, 807). ConclusionsProGlide is safe and effective for femoral artery closure in patients who ambulate within 30 min after cardiac catheterization; translating into improved patient satisfaction and substantial cost savings...|$|R
40|$|The Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue {{deployed}} three {{commercially available}} small unmanned aerial systems (SUASs) —an AirRobot AR 100 B quadrotor, an Insitu Scan Eagle, and a PrecisionHawk Lancaster—to the 2014 SR- 530 Washington State mudslides. The {{purpose of the}} flights was to allow geologists and hydrologists to assess the eminent risk of loss of life to responders from further slides and flooding, {{as well as to}} gain a more comprehensive understanding of the event. The AirRobot AR 100 B in conjunction with PrecisionHawk postprocessing software created two-dimensional (2 D) and 3 D reconstructions of the inaccessible “moonscape” region of the slide and provided engineers with a real-time remote presence assessment of river mitigation activities. The AirRobot was able to cover 30 – 40 acres from an altitude of 42 m (140 <b>ft)</b> in 48 <b>min</b> of flight time and generate interactive 3 D reconstructions in 3 h on a laptop in the field. The deployment is the 17 th known use of SUAS for disasters, and it illustrates the evolution of SUASs from tactical data collection platforms to strategic data-to-decision systems. It was the first known instance in the United States in which an airspace deconfliction plan allowed a UAS to operate with manned vehicles in the same airspace during a disaster. It also describes how public concerns over SUAS safety and privacy led to the cancellation of initial flights. The deployment provides lessons on operational considerations imposed by the terrain, trees, power lines, and accessibility, and a safe human:robot ratio. The article identifies open research questions in computer vision, mission planning, and data archiving, curation, and mining...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} report presents {{analyses of}} operational incidents which are {{considered in the}} safety analysis of the FCF argon cell and {{the effect that the}} operability of the emergency argon system has on the course of these incidents. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine if the emergency argon system makes a significant difference in ameliorating the course of these incidents. Six incidents were considered. The following three incidents were analyzed. These are: 1. Cooling failing on 2. Vacuum Pump Failing on 3. Argon Supplies Failing on. In the remaining three incidents, the emergency argon supply would have no effect on the course of these transients since it would not come on during these incidents. The transients are 1. Loss of Cooling 2. Loss of power (Differs from above by startup delay till the Diesel Generators come on.) 3. Cell rupture due to an earthquake or other cause. The analyses of the first three incidents are reported on in the next three sections. This report is issued realizing the control parameters used may not be optimum, and additional modeling must be done to model the inertia of refrigeration system, but the major conclusion concerning the need for the emergency argon system is still valid. The timing of some events may change with a more accurate model but the differences between the transients with and without emergency argon will remain the same. Some of the parameters assumed in the analyses are Makeup argon supply, 18 cfm, initiates when pressure is = - 6 iwg., shuts off when pressure is = - 3. 1 iwg. 170, 000 <b>ft</b> 3 supply. <b>Min</b> 1 / 7 th always available, can be cross connected to HFEF argon supply dewar. Emergency argon supply, 900 cfm, initiates when pressure is = - 8 iwg. shuts off when pressure is =- 4 iwg. reservoir 220 ft 3, refilled when tank farm pressure reduces to 1050 psi which is about 110 ft 3...|$|R
