5000|$|Over 300,000 {{board feet}} (700 m3) of Douglas fir timber, {{used to build}} a 250-foot (76 m) high {{falsework}} to support the arch during construction, was transported from the railroad terminal in Monterey over the narrow, one-way road to the bridge site. The falsework, built by crews led by E. C. Panton, the general superintendent, and I. O. Jahlstrom, resident engineer of Ward Engineering Co., was difficult to raise, because it was constantly exposed to high winds. Some of the <b>falsework</b> <b>timbers</b> were 10 x 10 in. [...] It took two months to construct the falsework alone. When high waves threatened the falsework foundation, construction was halted {{for a short time}} until winter storms abated.|$|R
50|$|To hasten {{erection}} of the 504-ft. span, it was necersary {{to proceed}} {{without waiting for}} completion of the piers. Falsework for this span, as mentioned, had been driven from the north end. The north approach trestle, piers and <b>falsework</b> for <b>timber</b> spans were driven and a temporary deck laid. One of the 70-ft. pony spans was used temporarily to span the excavation for the north pier, thus permitting the construction of this foundation.|$|R
50|$|The {{steelwork}} was fabricated at the Evans Deakin and Company {{plant at}} Rocklea, and the arches {{had just been}} fixed in place when, on 5 February 1931 a major flood swept <b>timber</b> <b>falsework</b> away but fortunately the steelwork remained in place.|$|R
40|$|The tension splice in timber {{construction}} {{is probably the}} most troublesome to design and frame efficiently, of all timber joints. This thesis treats of an effort to develop an efficient bolted steel fish plate splice which might be effectively used for such temporary structures as <b>falsework,</b> small <b>timber</b> trusses, and construction trestles where assembly is usually effected by unskilled or semi-skilled labour and shop fabrication is impracticable. Other requisites of such a splice being that the material employed should be both inexpensive and readily available...|$|R
50|$|During the 18th and 19th centuries, British {{bricklayers}} {{became aware}} that, by thickening the vertical mortar joint between regularly shaped bricks from bottom to top, they could construct an elliptical arch of useful strength over either a standard 'former' or over specially constructed <b>timber</b> <b>falsework</b> (temporary structure {{to be removed}} once the construction is complete). The bricks used in such an arch are {{often referred to as}} 'voussoirs'.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, the iron bridges on the Philadelphia line could no longer handle the latest {{locomotive}} designs at optimal speeds. The Susquehanna Bridge also required an additional track. In November 1907, the American Bridge Company and Eyre-Shoemaker Company began renovating the structure. <b>Timber</b> <b>falsework</b> was used to shore up sections of the bridge under construction, allowing construction to proceed with minimal disruption to traffic.|$|R
50|$|William Chapman had {{partially}} {{solved the}} problem in 1787 when building bridges for the Kildare Canal, the first being the Finlay Bridge near Naas. The Kildare {{was part of the}} Grand Canal Company, for William Jessop had been the engineer. Jessop would no doubt have discussed it with Outram, his partner, and he experimented with the idea on the Rochdale Canal. Examples are Gorrell's Lane and March Barn road bridges, though it is possible that they were built later. The method used was to build <b>timber</b> <b>falsework</b> parallel to the proposed arches. Planks were laid on the falsework parallel to the abutments. The position of the courses at the crown were marked out, then those across the remainder of the arch.|$|R
50|$|With the {{caissons}} sunk and the substructure complete, {{work began}} on the steel superstructure. The longest span between Pier I and Pier II {{was the first to}} be built. This span would be built without falsework, employing two cantilevered arms and a suspended arm. The next span to be complete was between Pier II and Pier III, using temporary <b>falsework</b> wood support <b>timbers</b> driven into the river bottom to hold the fixed span in place until it was complete. The span between Pier III and Pier IV was started concurrently. Span II to III was finished on December 22, 1915. On December 24, 1915, the river rose too quickly and washed away the false work. Span II to III was not damaged, although it moved 8 inches. Span III to IV was completely washed out, forcing a delay in the construction and a redesign on the span.|$|R
50|$|Work {{started on}} what was then called the Coos Bay Bridge on July 10, 1934. Glenn S. Paxson, Acting State Bridge Engineer while McCullough took {{a leave of absence}} to work on {{projects}} in Central America, was the supervising engineer during construction. The resident engineer was Raymond Archibald until 1935, when he joined McCullough, then Dexter R. Smith. The Northwest Roads Company of Portland, Oregon built the piers and the concrete structure. The steel sections of the bridge were built by the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company. The main piers are supported on piles driven into the bay's bed. The main towers of the cantilever section were fabricated off-site and moved to the bridge site in four sections. Work on the cantilever arms moved out in both directions from the tower, with the shoreward arm keeping slightly ahead of the center arm so that it would rest on a temporary support structure to stabilize the bridge. The concrete arch sections were erected using <b>timber</b> <b>falsework.</b> The bridge opened in June 1936.|$|R
40|$|The {{arch bridge}} is very strong. It looks like half a circle. Arch bridges {{used to be}} made of stone. The problem was that until the last block was in place, these bridges were {{unstable}} and could fall down. Construction field in Sri Lanka has lot of arch shape structures such as Buddhist Temples, Muslim mosque etc therefore aesthetic view of arch shape bridges are better than other shapes. Traditionally, arch bridges were constructed of stone, brick or mass concrete since these materials are very strong in compression and the arch could be configured so that tensile stresses did not develop. Contractors are not motivated to construct arch bridges due to difficulties of construction. If there is a simple method to construct an arch bridge it is economical and quick because of flow of the stream or flood will not be disturbed to the construction. Heavy machineries or advanced technology does not matter and local labour force can be utilized. In the locations which are inaccessible to transport material or heavy machineries, concrete arch is a solution with a suitable falsework. Most bridges in Sri Lanka are constructed over water ways therefore during the construction period finding a supporting base to construct an arch structure is very hard. Also river beds are located far below from the deck level of bridge and erection of stable falsework support will be another difficult task. These are the problems in arch bridge construction within the available technology of construction in Sri Lanka and tend to existing arch bridges are limited to short spans. The objective of this research was to obtaining an economical solution for this problem. In point form the scope of this research includes  find the possible methods to construct concrete arch bridges.  materials have to be used for falsework for construction of concrete Arch Bridges.  Types of Trusses possible to use as falsework. At the design stage of concrete arch bridge, suitable falsework truss also should be designed to get the support to construct the bridge. Similar to benefit of scaffoldings to building construction, falsework truss also will be benefited to arch bridge construction. It will facilitate to select different models of falsework truss for construction of various types of concrete arch bridges with higher spans or different curvatures. Steel trusses design for falsework is ideal solution because mainly simplicity of its erection process. Another option is a <b>timber</b> <b>falsework</b> for the construction of concrete arch bridge. Cost of the <b>timber</b> <b>falsework</b> is obviously high where the locations of long span of arch bridges or high level difference between river and deck of bridge. Within the Types of steel trusses economical one also has to be identified because of their cost of material and cost of fabrication. The types of steel trusses commonly used are Howe truss, Modified Howe truss, Pratt Truss or Warren Truss. Structural analysis computer software SAP 2000 was used to analyse trusses to achieve the objectives of the research. Based on the analysis of this research Modified Howe truss fabricated by steel angle iron is successful as economical falsework solution to the construction of concrete arch bridges in Sri Lanka...|$|R
