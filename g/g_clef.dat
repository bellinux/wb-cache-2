50|$|The {{neutral or}} {{percussion}} clef {{is not a}} clef {{in the same sense}} that the F, C, and <b>G</b> <b>clefs</b> are. It is simply a convention that indicates that the lines and spaces of the stave are each assigned to a percussion instrument with no precise pitch. With the exception of some common drum-kit and marching percussion layouts, the keying of lines and spaces to instruments is not standardised, so a legend or indications above the stave are necessary to indicate what is to be played. Percussion instruments with identifiable pitches do not use the neutral clef, and timpani (notated in bass clef) and mallet percussion (noted in treble clef or on a grand stave) are usually notated on different staves than unpitched percussion.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} musical expertise, a major cultural learning, on domain-specific cognitive flexibility. Participants had toswitch between music reading in <b>G</b> and F <b>clefs.</b> Two groups of music students at the Conservatory with various levels of expertise were compared: First-year and fifth-year students who were already engaged in professional orchestras or groups. We also contrasted pianists with other musicians, as only the former have to read in both <b>G</b> and F <b>clefs</b> when practicing their instrument. We hypothesized that pianists’ expertise in reading both clefs might enhance their cognitive flexibility from the start, which would be reflected by lower switch costs compared to other musicians in firstyear. We also hypothesized that, thanks to the demanding reading classes dispensed {{in the course of}} their studies, the other musicians would improve cognitive flexibility over the years, which would allow their switch costs to drop and to catch up pianists’ performance. Results confirmed our hypotheses by showing that, in first year at the Conservatory, the costs of switching were indeed lower for pianists compared to other musicians. Furthermore, the costs decreased in fifth year for the latter, with the advantage in favor of pianists not being significant anymore. Musical expertise particularly affected domain-specific cognitive flexibility when there was very few time to prepare for the next task. These results are compatible with an impact of musical expertise on reactive control, a late correction mechanism engaging attention when cognitive demands are perceived as high. Proactive control, an early selection strategy that maintains relevant information and facilitates task processing, thus appears less affected by musical expertise. info:eu-repo/semantics/inPres...|$|R

50|$|C clefs (along with G, F, Γ, D, and A clefs) were {{formerly}} used to notate vocal music.

To achieve purity of sound remains a challenge and demands an accomplished pianist with a good ear to produce the harmonic balance and symmetry the composition requires. It is common to repeat the composition several times.

50|$|A staff (or stave, in British English) {{of written}} music {{generally}} {{begins with a}} clef, which indicates the position of one particular note on the staff. The treble clef or <b>G</b> <b>clef</b> was originally a letter G and it identifies the second line up on the five line staff as the note G above middle C. The bass clef or F clef shows {{the position of the}} note F below middle C. While the treble and bass clef are the most widely used clefs, other clefs are used, such as the alto clef (used for viola music) and the tenor clef (used for some cello and double bass music). Notes representing a pitch outside of the scope of the five line staff can be represented using ledger lines, which provide a single note with additional lines and spaces. Some instruments use mainly one clef, such as violin and flute, which use treble clef and double bass and tuba, which use bass clef. Some instruments regularly use both clefs, such as piano and pipe organ.|$|E
50|$|The alto in F4 is the {{standard}} recorder of the Baroque, {{although there is a}} small repertoire written for other sizes. In 17th-century England, smaller recorders were named for their relationship to the alto and notated as transposing instruments with respect to it: third flute (A4), fifth flute (soprano; C5), sixth flute (D5), and octave flute (sopranino; F5). The term flute du quart, or fourth flute (B4), was used by Charles Dieupart, although curiously he treated it as a transposing instrument in relation to the soprano rather than the alto. In Germanic countries, the equivalent of the same term, Quartflöte, was applied both to the tenor in C4, the interval being measured down from the alto in F4, and to a recorder in C5 (soprano), the interval of a fourth apparently being measured up from an alto in G4. Recorder parts in the Baroque were typically notated using the treble clef, although they may also be notated in French violin clef (<b>G</b> <b>clef</b> on the bottom line of the staff).|$|E

40|$|This {{item was}} {{digitized}} by the Internet Archive. Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThis thesis deals with an important, so far neglected, document from César Franck's youth. It is titled "Fugues Vocales", {{and is in}} the possession of the music room of the Boston Public Library - part of the Alien A. Brown collection. It is a lengthy manuscript, some 309 pages, entirely in the handwriting of the author. It bears signatures and dates. This holograph is so very significant, in that it shows the very severe schooling which Franck had at the Paris Conservatoire, at the ages of fifteen and sixteen. It helps to give us some light as to how Franck was able to write music the way he did, and as to the severe discipline to which he continued to subject himself all through his long productive life. The main source of information available about Franck hus been the writings of his devoted pupils, chief of whom was Vincent D'Indy. There are also the speeches made at the dedication of the monument to Franck at St. Clotilde, and numerous magazine articles, most of which appeared upon the 100 th anniversary of his birth, in December 1922. Franck's widow and oldest son George, finally allowed some of his manuscripts, hitherto kept among the papers of the family, to be studied by Julien Tiersot, who has written at some length about them. César-Auguste Franck was born at Liège, Belgium on December 10, 1822. His father was Flemish and his mother German. Frances father wanted him to become a professional pianist, so he very early started a musical careers. His first studies were at the Liège Conservatoire; they were completed at the Paris conservatoire. Even in his student days Franck's work was outstanding. He could transpose easily and perfectly, and could improvise with great skill. His real interest lay in composition, and to this work he devoted several hours of each day all through his long life. In 1872 he succeeded Benoist as organ professor at the Paris Conservatoire, where his organ classes became the real composition classes of the institution. His success as a teacher was so great that his pupils became known as his "disciples", and he as "Father Franck". He had a tremendously sincere interest in all humanity, and the rare faculty of inspiring his pupils to their best creative efforts. His teaching methods were far in advance of his time. He became the very source of the brilliant symphonic school which flowered in France in {{the last half of the}} XIXth century, and to which the music world is so greatly indebted. In his lifetime Frenck was unable to secure satisfactory presentations of his own compositions. He lived a spiritual and individual life, not in close tough with his contemporaries. They were jealous of his great talents, and quite incapable of understanding his ways. In his own compositions he leaned strongly toward the church and religious subjects. His great improvisations were done on the church organ at St. Clotilde, and his organ compositions are some of the finest in the literature of that instrument. His other creative work shows the stamp of the organ in it, in its excessive modulation, pauses for registration, contrapuntal style, and majestic spirituality. His compositions include orchestral works, oratorios, operas, some songs, a violin concerto, and piano pieces. He originated the cyclic form. Franck lived almost all of his quiet life in Paris, happily married, spending ail his time teaching and composing. He died there November 8, 1890. César Franck was very meticulous about all his music writing. It was his habit to recopy and preserve all his work. There are three volumes of his student work still preserved in France, in addition to "Fugues Vocales" in the possession of the Boston Public Library. The latter volume was brought here from Paris by Mr. Allen A. Brown, and presented to the library October 1, 1912. There are seventy-six vocal fugues in the collection, worked by Franck while at the Paris Conservatoire, where he was a student of Leborne. The work was begun in October 1837, and the final date, which is not quite clear, reads July 1740 ? The volume is beautifully written, by hand, in ink, with each fugue spaced so as to cover the page completely. Each fugue is carefully labeled, with the number of parts and the author of the fugue subject noted at the top of each. The fugues range from two to eight parts. Two examination and three competition fugues are contained in the book. In "Fugues Vocales" Franck makes several references to Cherubini's text "Cours de contrepoint et fugue". He has followed Cherubini's rules on fugue writing explicitly. There is a great variety of treatment within these fugue the possibilities of each fugue subject are exhausted in all arrangements - in augmentation, diminution, inversion, canon, stretto, and contrary motion, even in occasional use of retrogression. There is usually some slight modulation in part I. If there is no chromaticism, in the subject, it is very often introduced in the counter-subject. The transition from Part I to Part II is always very difficult to determine, the two parts often seeming continuous. In Part II the modulation is chiefly to closely related keys, the second section often closes on the V chord of the principal key, or its relative minor, or major. Part III is almost, if not always as long and as important as Part II. There is always a clear entrance of Part III, often preceeded by a complete rest. There is great variation in the closing of these fugues. Some have a lone plagel cadence, as if it were intended for an Amen. The minor fugues do not always end in a major chord, as do those of Bach. Through the entire volume "Fugues Vocales" Franck gives his own analysis of what he is doing with the subject. The principal subject is labeled with a Roman numeral I, and the counter-subjects are labeled with the Arabic numerals 2, 3 etc. He also notes the "augmentation", "diminution", "inversion",, and "stretto". Apparently after the December 1837 examination, Franck was permitted to use his own themes for the first time, the first one appears on page 63, immediately following the December 18, 1837 examination. Somewhat longer fugues appear after the second examination dated June 14, 1838. There are fifteen fugues with subjects by Franck himself in the collection. I am net at all sure that the fugues appear in the manuscript in the order in which they were worked. Some of the handwriting in the latter part of the book seems like earlier work. The familiar paraphe in the signature does not appear after page 178. Many of the fugues seem more instrumental than vocal, although they almost all have the voice parts listed. Franck uses four different clefs - soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. The <b>G</b> <b>clef</b> does not appear. If my interpretation of the dates is correct, this volume covers three years work. Franck has covered the entire material in the first year's work, with the S part, 2 choir fugue in she examination of June 1838. There seems to he no real advance after that, mere reworking of the same principals with new subjects. A close study of this hook makes one view it with reverence and awe, that so young a pupil could have been so gifted and so mature, and so methodical about perpetuating his routine exercises for posterity. Franck benefited all his long and productive life, however, from the careful training in his youth. Without it he could never have written the works he did in their magnificent contrapuntal style...|$|E
