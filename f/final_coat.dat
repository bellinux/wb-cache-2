The factors that determine the coating structure are important because the structure determines the physical, optical, and printing properties.

Coatings with different polymers and pigments were characterized in terms of steady shear and viscoelastic properties. These coatings were applied onto plastic film and paper with a laboratory rod coater, a spray coater, and a high-speed blade coater.

40|$|In {{heavy duty}} gas turbines, the loading {{boundary}} conditions of MCrAlY systems are differently weighted for different operation regimes {{as well as}} for each turbine component or even in individual part locations. For an overall optimized component protection it is therefore of interest to produce coatings with flexible and individually tailored properties. In this context, ALSTOM developed an Advanced Modular Coating Technology (AMCOTEC™), which is based on several powder constituents, each providing specific properties to the <b>final</b> <b>coating,</b> in combination with a new application method, allowing in-situ compositional changes. With this approach, coating properties, such as oxidation, corrosion, and cyclic lifetime, etc., can be modularly adjusted for individual component types and areas. For demonstration purpose, a MCrAlY coating with modular ductility increase was produced using the AMCOTEC™ methodology. The method was proven to be cost effective and a highly flexible solution, enabling fast compositional screening. A calculation method for <b>final</b> <b>coating</b> composition was defined and validated. The modular addition of ductility agent enabled increasing the coating ductility with up to factor 3 with only slight decrease of oxidation resistance. An optimum composition with respect to ductility is reached with addition of 20 wt. % of ductility agent...|$|R
