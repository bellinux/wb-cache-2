25|$|Aerodynamic reasons led to {{the design}} of the power cars' front as well as the <b>flush</b> <b>fitting</b> of the windows and the low skirts. In places without windows, 6mm thick glass is used to {{continue}} the ribbon glazing.|$|R
2500|$|The cowling {{fasteners}} were new, <b>flush</b> <b>fitting</b> [...] "Amal" [...] {{type and}} there were more of them. The oil tank (which had been moved from the lower cowling location of the Merlin engine variants to forward of the fuselage fuel tanks) was increased in capacity from 6 to 10 gal.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1982, Mitsubishi facelifted the Mirage range. Distinguished by the {{installation}} of <b>flusher</b> <b>fitting</b> headlamps that extended into the fender panels, stylists also designed a new grille insert. The taillights were larger, new firmer engine and transmission mounts were fitted, and a new, lighter and more rigid transmission case was developed. The dashboard was also updated, with rotating [...] "satellite"buttons mounted within fingertip reach for light and wiper functions.|$|R
2500|$|The Torino Talladega was {{equipped}} with unique front fascia that extended {{the length of the}} car by approximately [...] This front-end extension allowed Ford engineers to taper the front-end to reduce drag. The grille, which was normally recessed was made to be <b>flush</b> <b>fitting,</b> and the smoother rear bumper was reworked to fit the front. The rocker panels were rolled, which allow NASCAR teams to lower their race Talladegas by 5inches (127mm) legally.|$|R

50|$|The car was {{supplied}} with an {{adjustable steering column}} and body insulation. It comfortably carried four passengers with room for a small fifth passenger in {{the centre of the}} back seat. Even the quarter-lights were {{supplied with}} blinds, there were <b>flush</b> <b>fitting</b> footrests {{in the back of the}} large, adjustable, front seats with pull straps above. The back floor was flat except for the somewhat pronounced propellor shaft tunnel. The boot was provided with a fitted suitcase, the spare wheel sitting horizontally in the space below. The door could be let down and used as a luggage platform.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{a typical}} Italian design, with the Alfa Romeo grille with dual round headlights, recalling the Alfa Romeo Proteo from 1991, it is low-slung, {{wedge-shaped}} with a low nose and high kicked up tail. The {{back of the car}} is [...] "cut-off" [...] with a [...] "Kamm tail" [...] giving improved aerodynamics. The Spider shares these traits with the GTV except that the rear is rounded. The Spider featured a folding soft-top with five hoop frame, which completely disappears from sight under a <b>flush</b> <b>fitting</b> cover. An electric folding mechanism was fitted as an option.|$|R
50|$|The new {{chambers}} were {{a single}} storey building of brick and concrete. Silky oak timber was used extensively throughout the interior for the <b>fittings,</b> <b>doors</b> and furniture, {{the work of}} RV Rogerson's local joinery firm. Ornate plaster work adorned the ceilings while leadlight windows incorporating the Shire's logo {{were included in the}} main elevation. A detached toilet block was constructed {{at the rear of the}} building.|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} using five subjects to compare performance using standard and <b>flush</b> <b>fitting</b> rotary controls for electronic equipment. It vas found that the flush knob could be rotated more quickly through several revolutions, but a given setting accuracy was achieved less quickly using this flush knob. Some of the more general {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the flush knob are outlined. It {{should be noted that the}} primary objective of this study was to provide the participants with some experience in carrying out Human Factors studies and the time allowed was not such as to permit a comprehensive evaluation of the new knob design...|$|R

50|$|There are two models, with {{catalogue}} numbers 7100 and 7150 {{from the}} Möbel Kollektion. Both are nearly identical in finish. They {{are made of}} quality birch plywood finished with a light clear lacquer, with rounded corners formed by bending the plywood. This bending is enabled by the inside having a further two pieces of plywood which allow the bending of the rounded sides, as well as also the <b>flush</b> <b>fitting</b> of the flat sides and lid. Two strong metal hinges are {{on either side of}} the back end of the lid, the front end of which has a catch for keeping it closed, with a loop for using a padlock if desired by the user.|$|R
50|$|Extensive repairs {{were carried}} out in 2012, {{replacing}} the wooden foundations with brick, repairing broken <b>fittings</b> and <b>doors</b> and relining an interior plywood wall.|$|R
50|$|West Potato House is a {{historic}} potato house located near Delmar, Sussex County, Delaware. It {{one of the last}} surviving examples of its building type. It was built about 1925, and is a 1 1/2-story, gable fronted, balloon frame structure on a concrete block foundation. The house has a cellar. It measures 37 feet, 6 inches, by 13 feet, 9 inches. It retains a number of important elements characteristic of potato house including: tall, narrow proportions, minimal fenestration, ventilation features, and tightly <b>fitting</b> <b>door</b> hatches.|$|R
50|$|Skirts were added, <b>fitting</b> <b>flush.</b> Three '51 Ford grills {{were used}} to custom-fabricate one, and the bumper was fitted with dagmars.|$|R
5000|$|The word {{block was}} derived from the masonry setting of the kettles. The kettles were {{hemispherical}} in form, cast-iron in material, and about 3 ft in diameter. They were sunk in walls of brick or gray limestone from 50 to 100 in a row, sheltered in long, narrow houses. The walls were hollow, admitting the circulation of the fire of a furnace and the heat was driven under the kettles by a powerful blower. A worker tending the furnace would open the close <b>fitting</b> <b>doors</b> and shovel coal which [...] "would disappear in the ferocious glow of the fire." ...|$|R
50|$|The portal door is ornamented with Corinthian pilasters and {{wrought iron}} <b>door</b> <b>fittings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The IS-3 was {{designed}} as a high performance sailplane for record-breaking and international competition flying. The development of the IS-3 was in four distinct phases with differences in wing position and construction as well as fuselage design. The original glider, first flown on 19 August 1953, was built primarily of wood with a pod and boom style fuselage and high-set wings. The streamlined pod contained the enclosed cockpit with <b>flush</b> <b>fitting</b> canopy and supported the wings and the Duralumin sheet tubular tailbboom which supported the conventional tail surfaces at its extremity. The tapered wings were built with plywood-covered torsion box leading edges with fabric covering aft of the main spar, incorporating spoilers for approach control and differential ailerons to reduce adverse yaw. With the exception of the IS-3c and IS-3d the IS-3 family followed the pod and boom arrangement with variations in wing position, span, wing construction and undercarriage arrangement.|$|R
50|$|John Lambie {{improved}} {{conditions for}} enginemen by <b>fitting</b> cab <b>doors,</b> better handrails and footsteps to locomotives. He improved on Dugald Drummond's 4-4-0 design in 1894 and he introduced condensing steam locomotives of the 4-4-0T and 0-4-4T types for underground lines.|$|R

5000|$|The {{complex is}} {{reportedly}} {{haunted by the}} ghost of a former manager. It is stated on the CinemaWeb website, the ghost was first discovered by a repairman <b>fitting</b> <b>doors</b> onto cinema one. He claimed to have seen it as a [...] "shadowy figure" [...] walking across the foyer to the lift. However, his account states that it was a customer, not a manager, who was locked in one night and fell down the stairs in the dark. The customer was found dead in the morning. It is also stated that in order to do his work properly, one of the cleaners had to have every light on and the pre-show music playing so {{that he would not be}} too scared.|$|R

2500|$|Early in 1982, Rover {{unveiled}} the Cowley-built, facelifted {{line to the}} public. These cars benefited mostly from small cosmetic changes on the exterior {{as well as a}} quite extensively redesigned interior. Car spotters can distinguish the two series by the headlights, which were chrome-rimmed and <b>flush</b> <b>fitting</b> on the later, recessed on the earlier series, the deeper rear window, now fitted with a rear wash wipe, and the new plastic wrap around bumpers which replaced the three-piece rubber and stainless steel ones. Other details, which are not as easy to assign include the full-width rear badge strip under the tail lights, engine size badges on front wings, and a range of new wheel trims and alloy wheels. [...] The automatic gearbox was now a GM180 model, still offering three speeds but better ratios. [...] The electric window switch pack moved from the centre console to the driver's door (and is well remembered for lacking edge finishing trim around the recesses), and a fully automatic choke appeared – eliminating the manual choke lever which had a tendency to break.|$|R
2500|$|The {{plug and}} {{socket-outlet}} system defined in BS1363 {{is a result of}} one of the report's recommendations. [...] Britain had previously used a combination of 2A, 5A and 15A round pin sockets. [...] In an appendix to the main report (July 1944), the committee proposed that a completely new socket-outlet and fused plug should be adopted as the [...] "all-purpose" [...] domestic standard.

2500|$|The Chevette's {{front end}} {{featured}} a more aerodynamic-looking nose than the Kadett, based loosely {{on the design}} of the [...] "droopsnoot" [...] Firenza, itself said to be inspired by the Pontiac Firebird, a sister GM product. In contrast the Kadett had a more conventional, flat-fronted design. In 1980, the Chevette underwent a facelift with <b>flush</b> <b>fitting</b> headlights, giving it a [...] "family look" [...] alongside the larger Vauxhall Cavalier version of the Opel Ascona B. Mechanical changes included the introduction of Bosch distributors, revised heater ducting and a simplified throttle linkage. It also received new wheel designs, revised C-pillar vent covers and revamped interior trim with re-designed front seats to increase rear knee room marginally. However, it was effectively the beginning of a phase-out in favour of the newer Astra, Vauxhall's version of the front wheel drive Kadett D, which was launched in January 1980; although it was not produced in Britain until November 1981. The phasing-out of the Chevette continued in April 1983, when the hatchback model was discontinued due to the launch of the Spanish built Nova.|$|R
