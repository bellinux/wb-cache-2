60|$|I {{met with}} {{nothing in this}} City that made any Impression upon me to stay any longer than {{settling}} the small concern of Money I lodg'd there. The hurry of Business was too Mechanical an Entertainment, for one whose Head was filled with high Flights of Honour, Sieges, Battles, and other such like Sports. The French Army at this time lay upon the Rhine, and my Design was to make that Way. When I arriv'd there, I found they had surrounded Mentz in order to Besiege it. I was glad to begin my first Campaign with so glorious an Undertaking, not doubting, but {{a great deal of}} Bravery would be shown where the Flower of the Houshold was design'd for Action; but before I could make any Advantage of this Occurrence, I was to make my self known to some Person of Character who might introduce me so as to be a Spectator of that noble Siege. At last I met with a Scotch Gentleman, who rid in among the grand Molquetains, who being fully inform'd of my Warlike Dispositions, assur'd me he would put me into the readiest Method he cou'd to gain Experience; but when he inform'd me that I must not pretend to great Things on a sudden, and that I had at present only two Things in Election, either to carry a Musquet in a Common Foot Regiment, during the Siege, or which he wou'd rather advise me to (in case I had Money <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at that <b>expence)</b> <b>to</b> go to Strasburgh and put my self under Discipline for six Weeks or two Months among the French Cadets.|$|R
6000|$|I am (as I {{have already}} told you) going abroad in the spring; for this [...] I have many reasons. In the first place, I wish to study India and [...] Asiatic policy and manners. I am young, tolerably vigorous, abstemious [...] {{in my way}} of living; I have no {{pleasure}} in fashionable dissipation, [...] and I am determined to take a wider field than is customary with [...] travellers. If I return, my judgment will be more mature, and I shall [...] still be young enough for politics. With regard <b>to</b> <b>expence,</b> <b>travelling</b> [...] through the East is rather inconvenient than expensive: {{it is not like}} [...] the tour of Europe, you undergo hardship, but incur little hazard of [...] spending money. If I live here I must have my house in town, a [...] separate house for Mrs. Byron; I must keep horses, etc., etc. When I [...] go abroad I place Mrs. Byron at Newstead (there <b>is</b> one great <b>expence</b> [...] saved), I have no horses to keep. A voyage to India will take me six [...] months, and if I had a dozen attendants cannot cost me five hundred [...] pounds; and you will agree with me that a like term of months in [...] England would lead me into four times that expenditure. I have written [...] to Government for letters and permission of the Company, so you see I [...] am serious.|$|R
