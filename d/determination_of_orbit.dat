40|$|In {{recent years}} {{spacecraft}} designers have increasingly sought to use onboard Global Positioning System receivers for orbit determination. The superb positioning accuracy of GPS {{has tended to}} focus more attention on the system's capability to determine the spacecraft's location at a particular epoch than on accurate orbit determination, per se. The <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>orbit</b> plane orientation and orbit shape to acceptable levels is less challenging than the determination of orbital period or semi-major axis. It is necessary to address semi-major axis mission requirements and the GPS receiver capability for orbital maneuver targeting and other operations that require trajectory prediction. Failure to determine semi-major axis accurately {{can result in a}} solution that may not be usable for targeting the execution of orbit adjustment and rendezvous maneuvers. Simple formulas, charts, and rules of thumb relating position, velocity, and semi-major axis are useful in design and analysis of GPS receivers for near circular orbit operations, including rendezvous and formation flying missions. Space Shuttle flights of a number of different GPS receivers, including a mix of unfiltered and filtered solution data and Standard and Precise Positioning Service modes, have been accomplished. These results indicate that semi-major axis is often not determined very accurately, due to a poor velocity solution and a lack of proper filtering to provide good radial and speed error correlation...|$|E
40|$|Some simple {{guidelines}} {{based on}} the accuracy in determining a satellite formation s semi-major axis differences are useful in making preliminary assessments of the navigation accuracy needed to support such missions. These guidelines are valid for any elliptical orbit, regardless of eccentricity. Although maneuvers required for formation establishment, reconfiguration, and station-keeping require accurate prediction of the state estimate to the maneuver time, and hence are directly affected by errors in all the orbital elements, experience has shown that <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>orbit</b> plane orientation and orbit shape to acceptable levels is less challenging than the determination of orbital period or semi-major axis. Furthermore, any differences among the member s semi-major axes are undesirable for a satellite formation, since {{it will lead to}} differential along-track drift due to period differences. Since inevitable navigation errors prevent these differences from ever being zero, one may use the guidelines this paper presents to determine how much drift will result from a given relative navigation accuracy, or conversely what navigation accuracy is required to limit drift to a given rate. Since the guidelines do not account for non-two-body perturbations, they may be viewed as useful preliminary design tools, rather than as the basis for mission navigation requirements, which should be based on detailed analysis of the mission configuration, including all relevant sources of uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The {{main problem}} in the <b>orbit</b> <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the space debris {{population}} orbiting our planet is identifying which separate sets of data {{belong to the same}} physical object. The observations of a given object during a passage above an observing station are collectively called a Too Short Arc (TSA) : data from a TSA cannot allow for a complete <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> an <b>orbit.</b> Therefore, we have to solve first the identification problem, finding two or more TSAs belonging to the same physical object and an orbit fitting all the observations. This problem is well known for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>orbits</b> <b>of</b> asteroids: we shall show how to apply the methods developed for preliminary <b>orbit</b> <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> heliocentric objects to geocentric objects. We shall focus on the definition of an admissible region for space debris, both in the case of optical observations and radar observations; then we shall outline a strategy to perform a full orbit determination...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} {{idea of a}} new method for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> satellite <b>orbits</b> by transfer is from Two-Way Satellite Time and Frequency Transfer (TWSTFT). The original method is called "determination <b>of</b> satellite <b>orbit</b> by transfer". The method is not only for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> satellite <b>orbit</b> {{but also for the}} time transfer with high accuracy and precision. The advantage is that the accuracy and the precision for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> satellite <b>orbit</b> are very high and the new method is favorable for various applications. The combination of various signals disseminated and received forms various modes <b>of</b> satellite <b>orbit</b> <b>determinations.</b> If receivers at stations receive the own station-disseminated signals via a satellite transponder, it forms an orbit determination mode called "receiving the own station-disseminated signals mode". If receivers at all stations receive the signals disseminated from the master station via satellite transponders, it forms an orbit determination mode called "receiving the master station-disseminated signals mode". If all of receivers at stations receive all stations-disseminated signals via satellite transponders, it forms an orbit determination mode called "receiving all stations-disseminated signals mode". Also there are other combinations of signals for satellite orbit determination. For different orbit determination modes with different signal combinations, their rigorous formulae of processing are hereby presented in this paper. The accurate and the precise satellite <b>orbit</b> <b>determination</b> for both <b>of</b> the modes, "receiving the own station-disseminated signals mode" and "receiving the master station-disseminated signals mode" is attempted.

The proposed Long Arc Model is expected to provide a maximum Encke ratio that is an order of magnitude more reliable than that given by the secularly precessing ellipse.
