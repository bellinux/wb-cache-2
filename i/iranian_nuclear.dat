5|$|The {{squadron}} {{has since}} undertaken numerous missions during the Second Intifada and Operation Cast Lead. During the Second Lebanon War the Hammers flew 1,400 sorties, totalling 2,300 flying hours, {{more than any}} other IAF combat unit. During this conflict, the Ra'am's long range and endurance served it well in the close support role, as the aircraft could carry more munitions and remain on station longer than any other strike aircraft. It is these capabilities that place 69 Squadron at the forefront of Israel's strategic arm, and it is thus this unit that is reputed to have undertaken Operation Orchard, the destruction of a Syrian nuclear site on September 6, 2007. The squadron has also been linked to a possible Israeli strike against the <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> program.|$|E

25|$|The Democratic Party {{has been}} {{critical}} of the Iran's nuclear weapon program and supported economic sanctions against the Iranian government. In 2013, the Democratic led administration worked to reach a diplomatic agreement with the government of Iran to halt the <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapon program in exchange for international economic sanction relief. As of 2014 negotiations had been successful and the party called for more cooperation with Iran in the future. In 2015, the Obama administration agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which provides sanction relief in exchange for international oversight of the <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> program.|$|E
25|$|United States and Israel {{have refused}} to exclude {{the use of force}} to stop the <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> program. They have, however, always {{stressed}} that they consider the use of force as a last resort.|$|E
50|$|Iran's {{scientific}} {{progress is}} subject to many problems including funding, international sanctions and management. However, in some areas such as medicine, surgery, pharmacology, stem cell research and theoretical physics (e.g. string theory), Iranian scientists have found international reputation since the <b>Iranian</b> revolution. <b>Nuclear</b> technology and stem cell research were the two fields that have enjoyed special support from the central government and Iranian leadership since the revolution.|$|R
50|$|On Iran's {{nuclear program}} {{and its own}} {{relations}} with Iran, Pakistan adopted a policy of neutrality, and played a subsequent non-belligerent role in easing {{the tension in the}} region. Since 2006, Pakistan has been strategically advising Iran on multiple occasions to counter the international pressure on its nuclear program to subsequently work on civil nuclear power, instead of active nuclear weapons program. On international front, Pakistan has been a great advocate for <b>Iranian</b> usage of <b>nuclear</b> energy for economics and civil infrastructure while it steadily stop any <b>Iranian</b> acquisition of <b>nuclear</b> weapons, fearing another nuclear armed race with Saudi Arabia.|$|R

25|$|Given {{the growth}} in Iranian {{enrichment}} capability in 2010, the country may have intentionally put out misinformation to cause Stuxnet's creators {{to believe that the}} worm was more successful in disabling the <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> program than it actually was.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{a wave of}} assassinations {{targeting}} <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> scientists began. The assassinations {{were widely}} {{believed to be the}} work of Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence service. According to Iran and global media sources, the methods used to kill the scientists is reminiscent of the way Mossad had previously assassinated targets. The assassinations were alleged to be an attempt to stop Iran's nuclear program, or to ensure that it cannot recover following a strike on <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> facilities. In the first attack, particle physicist Masoud Alimohammadi was killed on 12 January 2010 when a booby-trapped motorcycle parked near his car exploded. On 12 October 2010, an explosion occurred at an IRGC military base near the city of Khorramabad, killing 18 soldiers. On 29 November 2010, two senior <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> scientists, Majid Shahriari and Fereydoon Abbasi, were targeted by hitmen on motorcycles, who attached bombs to their cars and detonated them from a distance. Shahriari was killed, while Abbasi was severely wounded. On 23 July 2011, Darioush Rezaeinejad was shot dead in eastern Tehran. On 11 January 2012, Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan and his driver were killed by a bomb attached to their car from a motorcycle.|$|E
5000|$|United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) is a non-partisan, {{non-profit}} {{advocacy organization}} in the United States that seeks [...] "to prevent Iran from fulfilling its ambition to become a regional super-power possessing nuclear weapons."

25|$|On {{the same}} day two <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> {{scientists}} were targeted in separate, but nearly simultaneous car bomb attacks near Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran. Majid Shahriari, a quantum physicist was killed. Fereydoon Abbasi, a high-ranking official at the Ministry of Defense was seriously wounded. Wired speculated that the assassinations could indicate that whoever was behind Stuxnet {{felt that it was}} not sufficient to stop the nuclear program. That same Wired article suggested the Iranian government could have been behind the assassinations. In January 2010, another <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> scientist, a physics professor at Tehran University, was killed in a similar bomb explosion. On 11 January 2012, a Director of the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility, Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, was killed in an attack quite similar to the one that killed Shahriari.|$|E
25|$|Despite of {{politicians}} talks, Israeli public {{does not seem}} to share the same concern about the <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> deal. Or rather, they do acknowledge that nuclear capability in Iran is a threat and they {{do not believe that the}} new agreement proposed by Obama will solve the situation. However, in recent polls, when asked to rank what is the major threat to Israeli security, Iran's nuclear power figured only in second position. Hamas and Hezbollah's terrorism is what concerns the most. Also when asked about internal issues, what figured as the highest concern for Israel's stability was the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, not the <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> threat. So, eventhough the population shares with the politicians the same concern about the nuclear threat, they do not think that should be the countrie's first issue to deal with.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> {{program has}} been {{controversial}} as, although {{the development of a}} civilian nuclear power program, including enrichment activities, is explicitly allowed {{under the terms of the}} Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), there have been allegations that Iran has been illicitly pursuing a nuclear weapons program, in violation of the NPT (see Iran and weapons of mass destruction).|$|E

25|$|In January 2004, Gates co-chaired a Council on Foreign Relations {{task force}} on U.S. {{relations}} towards Iran. Among the task force's primary recommendation was to directly engage Iran on a diplomatic level regarding <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> technology. Key points included a negotiated position that would allow Iran to develop its nuclear program {{in exchange for a}} commitment from Iran to use the program only for peaceful means.|$|E
50|$|Abbasi has {{regularly}} {{been linked}} to Iran's alleged efforts to make the nuclear weapon, a process called weaponization. According to an Institute for Science and International Security report citing an expert close to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Abbasi was a key scientist in the alleged <b>Iranian</b> covert <b>nuclear</b> weapons program headed by Mohsen Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi, {{a strong supporter of}} Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program. Abbasi personally directed work to calculate the yield of a nuclear weapon as well as work on high energy neutron sources, this expert added.|$|R
50|$|<b>Iranian</b> {{development}} of <b>nuclear</b> technology {{began in the}} 1970s, when the U.S. Atoms for Peace program began providing assistance to Iran, which was then led by the Shah.

25|$|Israeli media {{discussed}} the strategic {{significance of the}} satellite, {{particularly with regard to}} Iran. It was reported that TecSAR's ability to produce images in adverse weather and at night would allow Israel to obtain more information about the suspected <b>Iranian</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons program. It was also reported that it would be capable of producing images of Iranian activities which previous satellites were unable to view.|$|E

5000|$|George Friedman, head of {{the global}} {{intelligence}} company Stratfor, has said Iran is [...] "decades away" [...] from developing any credible nuclear-arms capacity and that an attack on Iran would have grave repercussions for the global economy. If Iran ever did develop nuclear weapons, Israeli academic Avner Cohen has observed [...] "that {{the prospect of a}} deliberate <b>Iranian</b> first <b>nuclear</b> strike on Israel, an out-of the-blue scenario, is virtually nonexistent... The chances of Iran - or for that matter any other nuclear power - unleashing a nuclear strike against Israel, which has nuclear capabilities itself, strike me as close to zero." ...|$|R
