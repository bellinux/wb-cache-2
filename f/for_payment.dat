The commander of the Anglo-Egyptian expedition, Kelly, became the first Governor of the Darfur province with his office located in the Sultan's palace throne room until May 1917. He was then promoted to brigadier general and given command of the 5th Mounted Brigade, which was part of the Australian Mounted Division fighting in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|The most {{pressing}} economic matter the Nazis initially faced was the 30 percent national unemployment rate. Economist Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, President of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics, created in May 1933 a scheme for deficit financing. Capital projects were {{paid for with}} the issuance of promissory notes called Mefo bills. When the notes were presented <b>for</b> <b>payment,</b> the Reichsbank printed money to do so. While the national debt soared, Hitler and his economic team expected that the upcoming territorial expansion would provide the means of repaying the debt. Schacht's administration achieved a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, the largest of any country during the Great Depression.|$|E

5|$|Abu Bakar's {{relationship}} with the ruler of Muar, Sultan Ali was strained. Soon after Abu Bakar succeeded his father, he {{sent a letter to}} Sultan Ali asserting Johor's sovereignty over Segamat, which Sultan Ali had hoped to exert political influence over. In addition, Sultan Ali, who had borrowed a large sum from an Indian moneylender in 1860, became a source of irritation for Abu Bakar. Facing difficulties in repaying his debt, Sultan Ali asked Abu Bakar to pay Ali's monthly pension to the moneylender; but he alternated asking <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> to himself and to the moneylender. In 1866, when the moneylender lodged a complaint with the British government, Sultan Ali tried to borrow from Abu Bakar to repay his outstanding debts. As a result of these constant irritations, Abu Bakar persuaded the Straits Governor to sign an agreement to terminate Sultan Ali's pension at the agreement of Abu Bakar and Governor.|$|E
5|$|Chesney served {{again as}} the leader of Stephen's army at Wallingford Castle in 1153 and in August he was {{defeated}} by Henry of Anjou. The subsequent peace settlement, the Treaty of Wallingford, gave Henry the English throne after Stephen's death. A part of the treaty awarded control of Oxford Castle to Roger de Bussy. Although Chesney had lost control of the castle, none of his lands were confiscated. Early in 1154, Chesney was with Henry, as he was a witness on two charters of Henry's. After Henry's ascension to the throne, Chesney came to terms with the new king, and received confirmation of his lands from the king by 1157. He spent time in Normandy with Henry from 1159 through to 1161. He continued to receive favours from the king, such as exemption <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of danegeld on his manor of Deddington in 1156.|$|E

5|$|In early 1612, {{the year}} of the trials, every justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of recusants in their area, i.e. those who refused to attend the English Church and to take communion, a {{criminal}} offence at that time. Roger Nowell of Read Hall, on the edge of Pendle Forest, was the JP for Pendle. It was against this background of seeking out religious nonconformists that, in March 1612, Nowell investigated a complaint made to him by the family of John Law, a pedlar, who claimed to have been injured by witchcraft. Many of those who subsequently became implicated as the investigation progressed did indeed consider themselves to be witches, in the sense of being village healers who practised magic, probably in return <b>for</b> <b>payment,</b> but such men and women were common in 16th-century rural England, an accepted part of village life.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{surrendered}} {{cities were}} allowed complete autonomy in exchange <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of the kharaj poll-tax. Following {{the death of}} Emperor John V Palaiologos in 1391, however, Manuel II escaped Ottoman custody and went to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor, succeeding his father. This angered Sultan Bayezid I, who laid waste to the remaining Byzantine territories, and then turned on Chrysopolis, which was captured by storm and largely destroyed. Thessalonica too submitted again to Ottoman rule at this time, possibly after brief resistance, but was treated more leniently: although the city was brought under full Ottoman control, the Christian population and the Church retained most of their possessions, and the city retained its institutions. Thessalonica remained in Ottoman hands until 1403, when Emperor Manuel II sided with Bayezid's eldest son Süleyman in the Ottoman succession struggle that broke out following the crushing defeat and capture of Bayezid at the Battle of Ankara against Tamerlane in 1402. In exchange for his support, in the Treaty of Gallipoli the Byzantine emperor secured the return of Thessalonica, part of its hinterland, the Chalcidice peninsula, and the coastal region between the rivers Strymon and Pineios.|$|E
5|$|J. E. Wright {{took over}} as {{secretary}} in 1911, and advocated {{the formation of a}} limited company to run a professional club, believing amateur football would not succeed in a rugby league stronghold. The club turned professional in 1912, and acquired a rough plot of land known as Field View. York were admitted to the Midland League in June 1912, and the new ground was opened with a 2–1 win over Rotherham Town, which was played before 5,000 spectators. They played in the Midland League for three seasons, achieving a highest finish of 10th of 20 teams in 1912–13, before ranking 12th in an 18-team league the following season. York were invited to a meeting to discuss the formation of a Third Division of the Football League, but with the outbreak of the First World War the meeting did not take place. Because of hostilities, the Midland League was suspended after 1914–15, in which York ranked 16th out of 20 teams. The club went into liquidation through the bankruptcy court in August 1917 after a creditor pressed <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> for the ground's stand. York's ground was taken over by the York Corporation, who leased it to allotment-holders.|$|E
