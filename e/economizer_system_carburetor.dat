40|$|Electrical {{consumption}} {{for data}} centers {{is on the}} rise as more and more of them are being built. Data center owners and operators are looking for methods to reduce energy consumption and electrical costs. One method of reducing facility costs for a chilled water plant is by adding an economizer. Most studies concerning <b>economizer</b> <b>systems</b> are conducted largely by looking at energy alone since the primary focus is reducing electrical costs. Understanding how much exergy is destroyed, where it is destroyed, and why it is destroyed provides a more complete view on how environmental impacts can be minimized while reducing energy usage.

40|$|An {{emerging}} technology to alleviate rising energy demands for data centers are economizers, which {{turn off the}} power consuming chillers and bring in outside air for cooling. However, contaminants in outdoor air can lower the reliability of the electronics through corrosion, which can negate any energy savings. This experiment seeks to determine if the indoor air quality of <b>economizer</b> <b>systems</b> is suitable for data center use. The mass concentrations of the particulate matter were measured both inside and outside of the data center, using aerosol instruments. Particles were captured using collection filters, to identify their chemical properties. It is shown that indoor particle concentrations rise when the economizer is operating, due to bringing in outside air. However, the concentrations are well below the ASHRAE standard, which confirms that economizer use does not pose a risk for the servers in a data center...|$|R

40|$|The {{integrated}} gasification {{combined cycle}} (IGCC) {{is the most}} environmentally friendly coal-fired power generation technology that offers near zero green house gas emissions. This technology has higher thermal efficiency compared to conventional coal-fired power generation plants and uses up to 50 % less water. This work involves the optimization of IGCC power plants by applying process integration techniques to maximize the use of energy available within the plant. The basis of this project was the theoretical investigations which showed that optimally designed and operated IGCC plants can achieve overall thermal efficiencies in the regions of 60 %. None of the current operating IGCC plants approach this overall thermal efficiency, with the largest capacity plant attaining 47 %. A common characteristic {{in most of these}} IGCC plants is that an appreciable amount of energy available within the system is lost to the environment through cold utility, and through plant irreversibility to a smaller extent. This work focuses on the recovery of energy, that is traditionally lost as cold utility, through application of proven process integration techniques. The methodology developed comprises of two primary energy optimization techniques, i. e. pinch analysis and the contact <b>economizer</b> <b>system.</b> The idea behind using pinch analysis was to target for the maximum steam flowrate, which will in turn improve the power output of the steam turbine. An increase in the steam turbine power output should result in an increase in the overall thermal efficiency of the plant. The contact <b>economizer</b> <b>system</b> is responsible for the recovery of low potential heat from the gas turbine exhaust en route to the stack to heat up the boiler feed water (BFW). It was proven in this work that a higher BFW enthalpy results in a higher overall efficiency of the plant. A case study on the Elcogas plant illustrated that the developed method is capable of increasing the gross efficiency from 47 % to 55 %. This increase in efficiency, however, comes at an expense of increased heat exchange area required to exchange the extra heat that was not utilized in the preliminary design.

40|$|In {{a utility}} boiler, the most heat loss {{is from the}} exhaust flue gas. In {{order to reduce the}} exhaust flue gas {{temperature}} and further boost the plant efficiency, an improved indirect flue gas heat recovery system and an additional <b>economizer</b> <b>system</b> are proposed. The waste heat of flue gas is used for high-pressure condensate regeneration heating. This reduces high pressure steam extraction from steam turbine and more power is generated. The waste heat recovery of flue gas decreases coal consumption. Other approaches for heat recovery of flue gas, direct utilization of flue gas energy and indirect flue gas heat recovery system, are also considered in this work. The proposed systems coupled with a reference 330 MWe power plant are simulated using equivalent enthalpy drop method. The results show that the additional economizer scheme has the best performance. When the exhaust flue gas temperature decreases from 153 ℃ to 123 ℃, power output increases by 6. 37 MWe and increment in plant efficiency is about 1. 89 %. For the improved indirect flue gas heat recovery system, power output increases by 5. 68 MWe and the increment in plant efficiency is 1. 69 %...|$|R

The investigated VAV system meets the load for 72 zones (68 perimeters and 4 interiors) consisting of classrooms, offices, conference rooms, etc. with highly diversified occupancy densities from 1. 875 to 2. 5 m 2 /person for the classrooms and from 10 to 15 m 2 /person for the offices.

50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s in the U.S. and Japan, the {{respective}} federal governments imposed increasingly strict exhaust emission regulations.

To comply with the new regulations, automobile manufacturers often made extensive and complex modifications to the engine carburetor(s). While a simple <b>carburetor</b> <b>system</b> is cheaper to manufacture than a fuel injection system, the more complex <b>carburetor</b> <b>systems</b> installed on many engines in the 1970s were much more costly than the earlier simple carburetors.

40|$|Condensing economizers recover {{sensible}} and latent heat from boiler flue gas, leading to marked improvements in thermal efficiency. This paper summarizes the current commercial status and continuing development efforts with {{one type of}} condensing economizer. In this design Teflon{reg_sign} covered tubes and enclosure walls are used to handle the corrosive condensate. Flue gas flows around the tubes and feed water, being heated, flows through the inside. In addition to improving thermal efficiency, condensing economizers {{can also be used}} to reduce particulate emissions primarily by inertial impaction of particles on tube surfaces, water droplets, and added impactors. Collected particles are then removed with condensate. Water sprays directly on the tubes can be used to enhance particle capture. With coal-firing, tests have shown particle removal efficiencies as high as 98 %. To enhance the emissions control potential of condensing economizer technology a two-stage <b>economizer</b> <b>system</b> concept has been developed. Two heat exchanger modules are used. The first is a downflow design and recovers primarily sensible heat from the flue gas. The second is upflow and recovers mostly latent heat. Condensate is collected in a transition plenum between the two stages. This configuration, termed the Integrated Flue Gas Treatment System, provides great flexibility for implementing emissions reduction strategies. Particulate emissions can be reduced without impacting sensible heat recovery by recirculating collected condensate to spray nozzles at the top of the second stage heat exchanger. In tests at BNL with heavy oil firing, particulate reductions over 90 % and final emission rates on the order of. 005 lb/MMBtu are achieved. Adding sorbents to the recirculated condensate reduces sulfur dioxide emissions and SO{sub 2 } removal efficiencies over 95 % are achieved. Also, condensing economizers show great potential for the removal of certain air toxics such as mercury and nickel...|$|R
