40|$|The {{elements}} {{of the theory of}} vacuum oscillations and the model of dynamical expansion of the theory of weak interactions works at the tree level, i. e. the model of dynamical analogy of Cabibbo-Kobayashi- Maskawa matrices and its further development, are given. It is shown that the quarks and massive vector bosons must be structural and these structural particles (subparticles) must interact to generate quark and vector boson masses. In this case the problem of singularity cancellations does not arise in this model. It is also shown that, for self consistency of the theory, the weak decays of <b>K</b> <b>mesons</b> must go through massive vector boson B but not W boson. In the framework of this model the probability of π K transitions (oscillations) in the diagram approach is computed.

50|$|In 1953, Lee joined Columbia University, {{where he}} {{remained}} until retirement. His first work at Columbia {{was on a}} solvable model of quantum field theory {{better known as the}} Lee Model. Soon, his focus turned to particle physics and the developing puzzle of <b>K</b> <b>meson</b> decays. Lee realized in early 1956 that the key to the puzzle was parity non-conservation. At Lee's suggestion, the first experimental test was on hyperion decay by the Steinberger group. At that time, the experimental result gave only an indication of a 2 standard deviation effect of possible parity violation. Encouraged by this feasibility study, Lee made a systematic study of possible P,T,C and CP violations in weak interactions with collaborators, including C. N. Yang. After the definitive experimental confirmation by C.S. Wu and her collaborators of parity non-conservation, Lee and Yang were awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize for Physics.|$|E
