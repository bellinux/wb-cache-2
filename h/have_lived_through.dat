5|$|Native North Americans {{were among}} the first to {{influence}} fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., Pinus halepensis) cannot germinate until after their seeds <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire plays a major role in the persistence and resilience of ecosystems.|$|E

When collecting is passed between generations, it might sometimes be that children have inherited symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Collecting can sometimes reflect a fear of scarcity, or of discarding something then later regretting it. Certain patterns of collection are common among people who <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> poverty or war.|$|E

He caulked it using a mixture of seal blood and flour, and, using wood and nails taken from packing cases and the runners of the sledges, he built a makeshift frame which was then covered with canvas. Shackleton was worried the boat [...] "bore a strong likeness to stage scenery", only giving the appearance of sturdiness. He later admitted that the crew could not <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> the voyage without it.|$|E

Taigman died in 2012 and Willenberg in 2016. Taigman stated of his experience, [...] "It was hell, {{absolutely}} hell. A normal man cannot imagine how a living person could <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> it – killers, natural-born killers, who without a trace of remorse just murdered every little thing." [...] Willenberg and Taigman emigrated to Israel after the war and devoted their last years to retelling the story of Treblinka. Escapees Hershl Sperling and Richard Glazar both suffered from survivor guilt syndrome and eventually killed themselves.|$|E
500|$|The {{pastoral}} Epistles, too, {{give the}} impression of being in real places, with flesh-and-blood people, at specific times of day. Epistle 48 tells how the friends return to Stockholm by boat after a night out on Lake Mälaren, one summer morning in 1769. Each of its twenty-one verses paints a picture of a moment in the peaceful journey, from the wind stirring the fallen sails, the skipper's daughter coming out of her cabin, the cockerel crowing, the church clock striking four in the morning, the sun glimmering on the calm water. The effects may seem to be haphazard, but [...] "each stanza is a little picture, framed by its melody. We remember it all, seem to <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> it, like a morning in our own lives." [...] Britten Austin calls it [...] "a new vision of the natural and urban scene. Fresh as Martin's. Detailed as Hogarth's. Frail and ethereal as Watteau's." ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{greatest}} mainstream success, however, {{was to come}} in 1978 {{with the}} publication of her fourth novel, Tirra Lirra by the River. The title is a quote from Tennyson's great ballad, [...] "The Lady of Shalott", which tells the tale of a female artist who meets a tragic end when she attempts to move beyond artistic isolation. The novel details the life of Nora Porteous, whose natural creativity is constrained by the fact that [...] "she herself doesn't know that she's an artist. She struggles through, trying to arrive at her art and never succeeding." [...] After thirty odd years away, Nora, now elderly, returns to Brisbane, where she spent her childhood. The novel is essentially a [...] "personally commentated replay of a life," [...] during which Nora recounts and reflects upon the events that have shaped the course of her life. Anderson chose to create a woman from a very specific era: born several decades before Anderson herself was alive, Nora would <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> World War I, World War II and The Great Depression, in a time and pace where [...] "artists, although they were known to exist, were supposed to exist elsewhere." [...] Nora struggles to submerge her various artistic and unconventional selves in favour of a more socially acceptable constructed persona. Nora uses the [...] "spinning globe," [...] her equivalent of the Lady of Shalott's [...] "crystal mirror," [...] to explore the various stages and facets of her life, and to conceal some of its more unsavoury aspects from herself, and from the reader.|$|E

500|$|By contrast, author Fay Weldon, while {{admitting that}} {{the series is}} [...] "not what the poets hoped for", {{nevertheless}} goes on to say, [...] "but this is not poetry, it is readable, saleable, everyday, useful prose". The literary critic A. N. Wilson praised the Harry Potter series in The Times, stating: [...] "There are not many writers who have JK's Dickensian ability to make us turn the pages, to weep – openly, with tears splashing – and a few pages later to laugh, at invariably good jokes... We <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> a decade {{in which we have}} followed the publication of the liveliest, funniest, scariest and most moving children's stories ever written". Charles Taylor of Salon.com, who is primarily a movie critic, took issue with Byatt's criticisms in particular. While he conceded that she may have [...] "a valid cultural point – a teeny one – about the impulses that drive us to reassuring pop trash and away from the troubling complexities of art", he rejected her claims that the series is lacking in serious literary merit and that it owes its success merely to the childhood reassurances it offers. Taylor stressed the progressively darker tone of the books, shown by the murder of a classmate and close friend and the psychological wounds and social isolation each causes. Taylor also argued that Philosopher's Stone, said to be the most light-hearted of the seven published books, disrupts the childhood reassurances that Byatt claims spur the series' success: the book opens with news of a double murder, for example.|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{were less}} {{enthusiastic about the}} episode than the general consensus. Although Josh Wigler of MTV declared [...] "TS-19" [...] a [...] "compelling hour", he professed that it was lacking for a season finale. [...] "While there was a massive fireball and a decent amount of zombie action," [...] explained Wigler, [...] "not to mention some concrete information regarding the outbreak, there are still several plot threads that haven't come close to resolution." [...] Vanity Fair Mike Ryan argued that {{in contrast to a}} [...] "great season", the episode was a mediocre conclusion to The Walking Dead first season, writing that [...] "this might have been the silliest hour of television that I've ever watched". Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club issued [...] "TS-19" [...] a B– grade: despite proclaiming that [...] "there was some good stuff" [...] in the episode, Pierce opined that it fell below his expectations. He denounced many scenes in the episode—notably the explosion sequence—as he felt it was a waste of cinematography. [...] "The fact that almost all the scenes played out in dark, closed quarters wasted The Walking Dead gorgeous cinematography; the pacing was again off beat, with far too much padded scenes of people looking at one another in shock; and, though I'm usually not bothered by plot contrivances, there's no way anyone in a vehicle that close to such a huge explosion would <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> it." [...] Writing for Cinema Blend, Nick Venable said that it was an interesting episode, although it could have been executed in a better manner.|$|E

That is why the consul had to become the burgomaster." [...] As to his partisanship, Mommsen replied: [...] "Those who <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through</b> historical events... see that history is neither written nor made without love and hate." [...] To the challenge that he favored the political career of Julius Caesar, Mommsen referred to the corruption and dysfunction of the tottering Republic: [...] "When a Government cannot govern, it ceases to be legitimate, and he who has the power to overthrow it has also the right." [...] He further clarified, stating the Caesar's role must be considered as the lesser of two evils. As an organism is better than a machine [...] "so is every imperfect constitution which gives room for the free self-determination of a majority of citizens infinitely [...] than the most humane and wonderful absolutism; for one is living, and the other is dead." [...] Thus, the Empire would only hold together a tree without sap.|$|E

[...] Pavel Felgenhauer has gone further and accused the government of also firing rockets from an Mi-24 attack helicopter, a claim that the authorities deny. Some human rights activists claim that at least 80% of the hostages were killed by indiscriminate Russian fire. According to Felgenhauer, [...] "It was not a hostage rescue operation... but an army operation aimed at wiping out the terrorists." [...] David Satter of the Hudson Institute said the incident [...] "presents a chilling portrait of the Russian leadership and its total disregard for human life".|$|E

Now that political events in Germany have restored to the concepts of human dignity and liberty their original significance, this is the opera which, {{thanks to the music}} of Beethoven, gives us comfort and courage.... Certainly, Fidelio is not an opera in the sense we are used to, nor is Beethoven a musician for the theater, or a dramaturgist. He is quite a bit more, a whole musician, and beyond that, a saint and a visionary. That which disturbs us is not a material effect, nor the fact of the 'imprisonment'; any film could create the same effect. No, it is the music, it is Beethoven himself. It is this 'nostalgia of liberty' he feels, or better, makes us feel; this is what moves us to tears. His Fidelio has more of the Mass than of the Opera to it; the sentiments it expresses come from the sphere of the sacred, and preach a 'religion of humanity' which we never found so beautiful or necessary as we do today, after all we <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>through.</b> Herein lies the singular power of this unique opera....
