40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{the question of}} moored vessel stationkeeping operations in pack ice, {{on the basis of}} full scale experience with the Kulluk in the Beaufort Sea. As part of this work, a data base which documents full scale ice load levels on moored vessels has been significantly extended, and now includes almost 700 individual ice loading events. In addition, more operationally oriented information about ice management support activities and levels of risk (alerts) has been blended with the load data, for each event. Various scatter plots of <b>expected</b> <b>ice</b> loads in managed pack <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> are presented. Data relating to the effect of different levels of ice management support on load and risk levels is also included. The implications of this information are outlined in relation to various moored vessel system operations in Grand Banks pack <b>ice</b> <b>conditions.</b> It is shown that moored vessel operations in the type of pack <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> periodically encountered on the Grand Banks should be less difficult than is currently perceived, provided systems with reasonable in-ice capabilities and adequate levels of ice management support are used.

40|$|Increasing {{trends in}} the arctic sea {{transport}} lead to the necessity to determine route specific <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> to ensure safe vessel transits. In order to achieve this, the comprehensive understanding of <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> from the past {{should be used to}} predict future trends for arctic sea <b>ice</b> <b>conditions.</b> This paper presents the development of such <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> database with the implementation of a satellite data source, which will become a basis for the determination of route specific <b>ice</b> <b>conditions.</b> A case study is performed in order to show how the database could be used to collect the route specific ice data for statistical analyses...|$|R

The NTSB {{found no evidence of}} severe <b>icing</b> <b>conditions,</b> which would have required the pilots to fly manually. Colgan recommends pilots fly manually in <b>icing</b> <b>conditions,</b> and requires them to do so in severe <b>icing</b> <b>conditions.</b> In December 2008, the NTSB issued a safety bulletin about the danger of keeping the autopilot engaged during <b>icing</b> <b>conditions.</b> Flying the plane manually was essential to ensure pilots would be able to detect changes in the handling characteristics of the airplane, which are a warning sign of ice accumulation.|$|R
40|$|Historical sea <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> were reconstructed for Izembek Lagoon, Bering Sea, Alaska. This lagoon is {{a crucial}} staging area during {{migration}} for numerous species of avian migrants and a major eelgrass (Zostera marina) area important {{to a variety of}} marine and terrestrial organisms, especially Pacific Flyway black brant geese (Branta bernicla nigricans). Ice cover is a common feature of the lagoon in winter, but appears to be declining, which has implications for eelgrass distribution and abundance, and its use by wildlife. We evaluated <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> from a model based on degree days, calibrated to satellite observations, to estimate distribution and long-term trends in <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> in Izembek Lagoon. Model results compared favorably with ground observations and 26. years of satellite data, allowing <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> to be reconstructed back to 1943. Specifically, periods of significant (limited access to eelgrass areas) and severe (almost complete ice coverage of the lagoon) <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> could be identified. The number of days of severe ice within a single season ranged from 0 (e. g., 2001) to 2 ̆ 265 67 (e. g., 2000). We detected a slight long-term negative trend in <b>ice</b> <b>conditions,</b> superimposed on high inter-annual variability in seasonal aggregate <b>ice</b> <b>conditions.</b> Based on reconstructed <b>ice</b> <b>conditions,</b> the seasonally cumulative number of significant or severe ice days correlated linearly with mean air temperature from January until March. Further, air temperature at Izembek Lagoon was correlated with wind direction, suggesting that <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> in Izembek Lagoon were associated with synoptic-scale weather patterns. Methods employed in this analysis may be transferable to other coastal locations in the Arctic. 9 2013 Elsevier B. V. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made between the observed <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> and those predicted by the Canadian Ice Service (CIS). The predicted <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> were obtained from ice charts prepared by the CIS, and the observed <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> were made by experienced Ice Observers on board various ice class vessels in different regio ns of the Arctic. The comparison showed that in most cases, the CIS ice predictions provide a reliable description of the actual <b>ice</b> <b>conditions.</b> Although there were differences between the predicted and observed conditions, there was no apparent large bias in the data. Additionally, an analysis was done to compare the Ice Numeral calculated from the observed <b>ice</b> <b>conditions</b> within a single 2 ̆ 01 cegg code 2 ̆ 01 d region of an ice chart. This analysis showed {{that there could be}} wide variation in the Ice Numeral within a single egg code region. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
50|$|Contributing to the {{accident}} were: 1) the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) failure {{to ensure that}} aircraft icing certification requirements, operational requirements for flight into <b>icing</b> <b>conditions,</b> and FAA published aircraft icing information adequately accounted for the hazards that can result from flight in freezing rain and other <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> not specified in 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 25, Appendix C; and 2) the FAA's inadequate oversight of the ATR 42 and 72 to ensure continued airworthiness in <b>icing</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Icing</b> <b>conditions</b> exist {{when the}} air {{contains}} droplets of supercooled liquid water; <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> are characterized quantitatively by the average droplet size, the liquid water content and the air temperature. These parameters affect the extent and speed that characterize the formation of ice on an aircraft. Federal Aviation Regulations contain a definition of <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> that some aircraft are certified to fly into. So-called SLD, or supercooled large droplet, conditions are those that exceed that specification and represent a particular hazard to aircraft.|$|R
50|$|A {{contributing}} factor was {{the decision of}} the crew to operate in <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> while near {{the lower end of the}} flight envelope while the flaps were retracted.

40|$|The physics which control {{aircraft}} {{ice accretion}} are reviewed {{in the context of}} identifying and forecasting hazardous <b>icing</b> <b>conditions.</b> The severity of aircraft icing is found to be extremely sensitive to temperature, liquid water content and droplet size distribution particularly near the transition between rime and mixed icing. The difficulty in measurement and the variability of these factors with altitude, position and time coupled with variable aircraft sensitivity make forecasting and identifying <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> difficult. Automated Pilot Reports (PIREPS) are suggested as one mechanism for improving the data base necessary to forecast <b>icing</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

50|$|All {{of these}} methods remove {{existing}} contamination, but provide no practical protection in <b>icing</b> <b>conditions.</b> If <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> exist, or are expected before takeoff, then anti-icing fluids are used.

40|$|Real-time {{measurements}} of ice growth during artificial and natural <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> were conducted using an ultrasonic pulse-echo technique. This technique allows ice thickness {{to be measured}} with an accuracy of + or - 0. 5 mm; in addition, the ultrasonic signal characteristics {{may be used to}} detect the presence of liquid on the ice surface and hence discern wet and dry ice growth behavior. Ice growth was measured on the stagnation line of a cylinder exposed to artificial <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> in the NASA Lewis Icing Research Tunnel (IRT), and similarly for a cylinder exposed in flight to natural <b>icing</b> <b>conditions.</b> <b>Ice</b> thickness was observed to increase approximately linearly with exposure time during the initial icing period. The ice accretion rate was found to vary with cloud temperature during wet ice growth, and liquid runback from the stagnation region was inferred. A steady-state energy balance model for the icing surface was used to compare heat transfer characteristics for IRT and natural <b>icing</b> <b>conditions.</b> Ultrasonic {{measurements of}} wet and dry ice growth observed in the IRT and in flight were compared with icing regimes predicted by a series of heat transfer coefficients. The heat transfer magnitude was generally inferred to be higher for the IRT than for the natural <b>icing</b> <b>conditions</b> encountered in flight. An apparent variation in the heat transfer magnitude was also observed for flights conducted through different natural icing-cloud formations...|$|R
