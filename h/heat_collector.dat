50|$|The Solar <b>Heat</b> <b>Collector</b> & Radiator is a heat {{collecting}} and heat radiating roof structure, designed for building roofs specifically. It {{was built to}} be used in conjunction with solar energy and uses a system of air circulation for increased efficiency. A solar <b>heat</b> <b>collector,</b> or solar thermal collector, is used today to capture solar radiation through electromagnetic radiation with the use of solar hot water panels, solar parabolic troughs, or solar towers. Today many people create their own DIY solar heat collectors, but the inventor William Goettl was the first to design and patent this technology.|$|E
50|$|Cogeneration or {{combined}} {{heat and}} power (CHP) {{is the use}} of a heat engine or power station to generate electricity and useful heat at the same time. Trigeneration or combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) refers to the simultaneous generation of electricity and useful heating and cooling from the combustion of a fuel or a solar <b>heat</b> <b>collector.</b>|$|E

50|$|Along {{with the}} solar {{orientation}} of {{buildings and the}} use of glass as a solar <b>heat</b> <b>collector,</b> the ancients knew other ways of harnessing solar energy. The Greeks, Romans and Chinese developed curved mirrors that could concentrate the sun's rays on an object with enough intensity to make it burn in seconds. The solar reflectors were often made of polished silver, copper or brass.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "solar collector" [...] {{commonly}} {{refers to}} solar hot water panels, but may refer to installations such as solar parabolic troughs and solar towers; or basic installations such as solar air heaters. Concentrated {{solar power plants}} usually use the more complex collectors to generate electricity by heating a fluid to drive a turbine connected to an electrical generator. Simple collectors are typically used in residential and commercial buildings for space heating. The first solar thermal collector designed for building roofs was patented by William H. Goettl and called the [...] "Solar <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> and radiator for building roof".|$|E
5000|$|The Solar <b>Heat</b> <b>Collector</b> & Radiator for Building Roof {{consists}} of a U-shaped duct with cross-section, and upstanding flanges. The duct structures between adjacent rafters and provides an intermediate partition between upper areas of rafters. There is also a radiation-transparent convection shield above the cover plate to stop heat being lost air movement. William Goettl, of Goettl Air Conditioning, patented this technology in 1977 through the U.S. Patent Office with patent number US4098260. [...] It has since been cited by five other patents and referenced by twenty-eight other patents, dating from 1977 to present day, including the modern model of a solar-powered water heating system designed by the Snyder National Corporation, and a solar heating panel by Solar Shelter Engineering Inc.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{space heating}} with solar air <b>heat</b> <b>{{collectors}}</b> is more {{popular in the}} USA and Canada than heating with solar liquid collectors since most buildings already have a ventilation system for heating and cooling. The two main types of solar air panels are glazed and unglazed.|$|R

50|$|William H. Goettl {{was one of}} the {{original}} members of the Sheet Metal Air Rail and Transportation (SMART) charter. He was an instrumental founding role for the Sheet Metal Workers’ Local Union 359 in Arizona, especially when they were writing their original members’ charter in 1937. After moving out of sheet metal work, he invested in the Goettl Brothers Metal Products in Phoenix and took over as the company leader in 1946. Ten years later, he was elected as President of the Air Conditioning Contractors Association. By 1972, Goettl had become the largest HVAC contractor in the United States and started introducing significant patents to the industry. William Goettl filed for a patent for the Solar <b>Heat</b> <b>Collector</b> & Radiator for Building Roof on February 7, 1977 and his patent published on July 4, 1978.|$|E
5000|$|Housed in {{the western}} part of the Arctic Ocean is the Beaufort Gyre, whose growing {{reservoir}} of freshwater is shrouded in mystery. In recent years, this increasing freshwater content (FWC) has been the focal point of many studies, particularly those concerning coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics. The majority of the Arctic’s freshwater content resides in the Beaufort Gyre. Although biased toward the Northern Hemisphere summer months, observations from submarines, ships, and stations on drifting ice suggest that the gyre has been expanding over the past two decades. Researchers have employed coupled sea-ice-ocean general circulation models in order to thoroughly analyze these observations. Model results show that Ekman transport plays an integral role in the variability of freshwater in the gyre, and thus in the Arctic Ocean. The prevailing rotational direction of the Beaufort Gyre is clockwise, following the prevailing wind circulation of the Polar High. Coriolis veers moving objects to the right in the northern hemisphere and 'to the right" [...] is inwards in a clockwise rotating system. This is why anything floating, including fresher water tends to move toward the centre of the system. Indeed, there is a slight bulge in the centre of the Beaufort gyre when it is rotating in its predominant clockwise direction. If, as is speculated, as the Arctic Ocean becomes a <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> resulting in a low pressure, counter clockwise rotating system, the Beaufort Gyre can be expected to follow suit and send the fresher water outward to be captured by the transpolar current. This could well bring up the saltier, slightly warmer Atlantic water which lies under the floating, fresher Arctic water.|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} program simulating a whole heating system for space heating in large multifamily houses or small district heating systems is presented. The system {{consists of an}} ambient-air natural convective <b>heat</b> <b>collector,</b> a heat store with vertical pipes in the ground, and an electrically driven heat pump. The most important design parameters from both a technical and an economical point of view are the sizes of the storage, the ambient-air <b>heat</b> <b>collector,</b> and the heat pump. The influence of these parameters on the technical result is discussed. With the aid of computer simulations it is shown how this influence can be presented in a generalized way. From this presentation a method to optimise this kind of system is outlined. Using typical costs for Sweden the total annual cost for some designs is calculated and a cost comparison is made with an oil fired burner. In the optimisation calculations optimum values for the main parts were determined. For the <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> and the storage size flat optimums were found. The heat pump size shall in most cases be as large as is practically possible, when such aspects as freezing of the soil have been taken into account. Compared to an already existing oil fired burner and to a heat pump without storage this system {{was found to be}} more expensive. Decreasing investment cost and increasing energy costs in the future can however make the system economically favourable...|$|E
40|$|NoThis paper aims to {{investigate}} experimentally {{the effects of}} circulating coolant flow rate, groundwater table fluctuations, infiltration of rainwater, {{on the amount of}} thermal energy that can be recovered from the near surface soil layers. A comprehensive experimental investigation was carried out on a fully equipped tank filled with sand. A <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> panel was embedded horizontally at the mid-height of the tank. Measurements of the temperature at various points on the <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> panel, adjacent soil, inlet and outlet were continuously monitored and recorded. After reaching a steady state, it was observed that increasing water saturation in the adjacent soil leads to a substantial increase on the amount of heat recovered. A model was proposed for the estimation of temperature along the <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> panel based on steady state conditions. It accounted for thermal resistance between pipes and the variability of water saturation in the adjacent soils. This model showed good agreement with the data. Whilst increasing the flow rate of the circulating fluid within the panel did not cause noticeable improvement on the amount of heat energy that can be harnessed within the laminar flow regime commonly found in ground source heat panels. Infiltration of rainwater would cause a temporary enhancement on the amount of extracted heat. Measurement of the sand thermal conductivity during a cycle of drying and wetting indicates that the thermal conductivity is primarily dependent upon the degree of water saturation and secondary on the flow path...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTyphoon {{is one of}} {{the major}} natural {{disasters}} in Taiwan. The solar water heater system installed in the house roof has the most serious damage caused by typhoon invasion. Because the wind blows into the backward of the solar water heater system, the heat collecter is damaged by the stronger wind pressure gradient induced between the upper and lower. This study was using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) method to investigate the flowfield over a suspended and ground solar water heater during the wind speed about 30 m/s, and compared the results with the experimental data for validation. Simulations of 60 % solar water collector model with different tilt angles and 40 % model with different guiding plate were also done in this study to investigate the effect of the guide plate. The result shows that the 3 D flowfield effect is clear, and 2 D model can not simulated the flowfield. The <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> erected away from the ground can be reduced to the uplift, and the separation bubbles are induced behind the bucket of the <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> surface. The cornner vortices generated and interacted from the collector-side, and the separation bubbles is extending in spanwise. The larger tilt angle of the solar collector causes the larger pressure difference in the leading edge. The guiding plate avoids the inflow directly hit the bottom of the solar collector, and it can efficiently reduce the leading edge pressure difference. Nevertheless, when the cross-sectional area of the guiding plate increase, the uplift force acted on <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> decreases and the drag force would be increased...|$|E

40|$|The EUV source {{output power}} and the {{collector}} optics lifetime {{have been identified as}} critical key issues for EUV lithography. In order to meet these requirements a <b>heated</b> <b>collector</b> concept was realized for the first time. An ellipsoidal collector Substrate with an outer diameter of 320 mm was coated with a laterally graded high-temperature multilayer. The interface-engineered Mo/Si multilayer coating was optimized in terms of high peak reflectivity at 13. 5 nm and a working temperature of 400 °C. Barrier layers were introduced on both interfaces to block thermally induced interdiffusion processes of molybdenum and silicon to provide long-term optical stability of the multilayer at elevated temperatures. A normal-incidence reflectance of more than 40 % at 13. 55 nm was measured after heating. After initial annealing at 400 °C for one hour, no degradation of the optical properties of these multilayer coatings occurred during both long-term heating tests for up to 100 hours and multiple annealing cycles. The successful realization of this high-temperature sub-aperture collector mirror represents a major step towards the implementation of the <b>heated</b> <b>collector</b> concept and illustrates the great potential of high-temperature EUV multilayer coatings...|$|R

A numerical study with FLUENT software {{has been carried}} out as to air performance in the slope solar energy power plant. The velocity field, temperature and pressure fields in the solar chimney, and the simulated result were compared with the simulated result of traditional solar chimney power generating equipment. The simulation results show that distribution of the temperature field and the velocity field in slope solar energy power plant and traditional solar chimney power generating equipment. In the case of the same height, the velocity of traditional is slightly larger than the slope style's, but there is little difference. In order to achieve the same power generation effect, the overall height of slope style is more than the traditional style, but the vertical chimney height of traditional style is greater than the slope style. The cost of construction of vertical chimney is expensive, and many problems have been considered, like radix saposhnikoviae and earthquake prevention, the <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> also need to be cleaned on time. The slope style can take full advantage of land, the height of vertical chimney will be reduced, so the construction of the chimney will be relatively easy. Rainwater can clean the <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> when it runs down from it. All things considered. The slope solar energy power plant has more development prospects. ...|$|E

40|$|Thermoelectric {{materials}} {{provide a}} means for converting heat into electrical power using a fully solid-state device. Power-generating devices (which include individual couples as well as multicouple modules) {{require the use of}} ntype and p-type thermoelectric materials, typically comprising highly doped narrow band-gap semiconductors which are connected to a <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> and electrodes. To achieve greater device efficiency and greater specific power will require using new thermoelectric materials, in more complex combinations. One such material is the p-type compound semiconductor Yb 14 MnSb 11 (YMS), which has been demonstrated to have one of the highest ZT values at 1, 000 C, the desired operational temperature of many space-based radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Despite the favorable attributes of the bulk YMS material, it must ultimately be incorporated into a power-generating device using a suitable joining technology. Typically, processes such as diffusion bonding and/or brazing are used to join thermoelectric materials to the <b>heat</b> <b>collector</b> and electrodes, with the goal of providing a stable, ohmic contact with high thermal conductivity at the required operating temperature. Since YMS is an inorganic compound featuring chemical bonds with a mixture of covalent and ionic character, simple metallurgical diffusion bonding is difficult to implement. Furthermore, the Sb within YMS readily reacts with most metals to form antimonide compounds {{with a wide range of}} stoichiometries. Although choosing metals that react to form high-melting-point antimonides could be employed to form a stable reaction bond, it is difficult to limit the reactivity of Sb in YMS such that the electrode is not completely consumed at an operating temperature of 1, 000 C. Previous attempts to form suitable metallization layers resulted in poor bonding, complete consumption of the metallization layer or fracture within the YMS thermoelement (or leg) ...|$|E
