[...] This economic development initiative provides {{resources for the}} recruitment or expansion of major research and development entities and innovation businesses in Florida. [...] With the groundwork already laid by the CSTC, Pruitt and a motivated group of local leaders, both public and private, were able to attract the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies to Port St. Lucie {{to set up an}} east coast operation. [...] Two years later, in April 2008, the Innovative <b>Incentive</b> <b>Fund</b> also helped bring the Oregon Health and Science University Vaccine Gene Therapy Institute (VGTI) to the area. [...] The development of this biotech cluster, in addition to the cluster including the Scripps Research Institute and the Max Planck Institute in Jupiter, Florida, has allowed the area to become known as Florida’s “Research Coast,” a designation first given by Senator Ken Pruitt.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn July 2015, a {{national}} scheme for after-hours <b>incentive</b> <b>funding</b> for general practices was re-introduced in Australia, 2 -years after funding {{was transferred to}} regional primary health care organisations (Medicare Locals). The re-introduction was recommended in a 2014 review of after-hours primary care reflecting the “overwhelming desire” among general practice. Given the centrality of after-hours care provision in rural and remote practices identified in the review, we compare and contrast the current and historical after-hours <b>incentive</b> <b>funding</b> mechanisms focussing on fairness towards rural general practices. While there are similarities between the current and historical mechanisms, significant differences exist. The comparison is not straightforward. The major consistency is utilisation of practice standardised whole patient equivalents (SWPE) {{as the basis of}} funding, inherently favouring large urban general practices. This bias is expected to increase given a shift in focus from practices with no option but to provide 24 / 7 care to any practice providing 24 / 7 care; and an associated increased funding per SWPE. Differences primarily pertain to classification processes, in which the realities of rural service provision and recognition of regional support mechanisms are given minimal consideration. Rapid introduction of the new general practice after-hours <b>incentive</b> <b>funding</b> mechanism has led to inconsistencies and has exacerbated inherent biases, particularly inequity towards rural providers. Impact on morale and service provision in non-urban areas should be monitored...|$|R
