40|$|The forkbeard, Phycis phycis, and conger eel, Conger conger, are two coastal species, {{with a wide}} {{bathymetric}} {{and geographical}} distribution. The longline fleet of the Azores catches these two important commercial species. Few studies on their diet composition were found in literature. Data were collected during the demersal cruise surveys that took place abo rd the R/V “Arquipélago ” {{during the spring of}} 1996 and 1997. Stomachs of 53 <b>forkbeards</b> and 95 conger eels were examined to define their diets. Both species fed primarily on fishes, mainly on two benthopelagic species (Capros aper and Macroramphosus scolopax). However, the relative importance of fish was higher for conger eel than for forkbeard, which fed secondarily on decapods. Prey composition of the diet did not vary between sexes, predator size or areas. However, some differences were found on di t composition between depth strata. Prey composition indicates that both predators have the ability to feed near the bottom on benthic prey or in the water column on benthopelagic species...|$|E

He invaded England next year in retaliation. <b>Forkbeard's</b> assault on England lasted ten years, until 1013, when Æthelred fled to the continent. <b>Forkbeard</b> was crowned King of England on Christmas Day, but only reigned for five weeks before dying.

50|$|The Encomium Emmae Reginae {{suggests}} that, in {{an effort}} to spread Christianity throughout Scandinavia, the Danish King Sweyn <b>Forkbeard</b> constructed a Monastery in Lund and dedicated it to the holy trinity. The author of the Encomium Emmae Reginae, a Flemish monk, was likely unaware that no monasteries had as of yet been constructed in Scandinavia by the time of King Sweyn <b>Forkbeard’s</b> death (3 February 1014). Thus, the Clemens Church of Lund could very well have been the “monastery” constructed on the orders of King Sweyn <b>Forkbeard.</b> If so, the Clemens Church at Lund serves as an important landmark from the Christianization of Scandinavia.|$|R
