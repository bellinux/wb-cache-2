25|$|The Sims Bustin' Out is {{the second}} title in The Sims console series. Bustin' Out was {{released}} for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and N-Gage {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2003. As the title suggests, Sims can get out of the house to visit other locations such as Shiny Things Lab or Casa Caliente. There are two modes. Bust Out Mode which has mission based gameplay and <b>Freeplay</b> Mode which is open-ended gameplay very much like the original The Sims PC game. It was the second Sims game to not be on the PC; it was a follow up to The Sims, which was very similar to Bustin' Out, except the aims were shifted to getting job promotions and constantly fulfilling goals to get ahead in the game. The PlayStation 2 version also features the option to play online, though EA no longer supports it.|$|E

5000|$|Free play is a {{literary}} concept from Jacques Derrida's 1966 essay, [...] "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences." [...] In his essay, Derrida {{speaks of a}} philosophical “event” that has occurred to the historic foundation of structure. Before the “event,” man {{was the center of}} all things; therefore, everything was compared to the ideas and images of man. After the “event,” however, man could no longer be judged the center of the universe. Without this centralized reference, all that is left is “free play.”Up until the event which I wish to mark out and define, structure—or rather the structurality of structure—although it has always been involved, has always been neutralized or reduced, and this by a process of giving it a center or referring it to a point of presence, a fixed origin. The function of this center was not only to orient, balance, and organize the structure—one cannot in fact conceive of an unorganized structure—but above all {{to make sure that the}} organizing principle of the structure would limit what we might call the <b>freeplay</b> of the structure. No doubt that by orienting and organizing the coherence of the system, the center of a structure permits the <b>freeplay</b> of its elements inside the total form. And even today the notion of a structure lacking any center represents the unthinkable itself.— [...] "Structure, Sign and Play" [...] in Writing and Difference, p. 278 [...] Besides the tension of <b>freeplay</b> with history, there is also the tension of <b>freeplay</b> with presence. <b>Freeplay</b> is the disruption of presence. The presence of an element is always a signifying and substitutive reference inscribed in a system of differences and the movement of a chain. <b>Freeplay</b> is always an interplay of absence and presence, but if it is to be radically conceived, <b>freeplay</b> must be conceived of before the alternative of presence and absence; being must be conceived of as presence or absence beginning with the possibility of <b>freeplay</b> and not the other way around.—"Structure, Sign and Play" [...] in Writing and Difference, p. 294 ...|$|E

50|$|In present <b>Freeplay</b> {{radios and}} other products, {{clockwork}} mechanisms storing energy in a mainspring {{have now been}} replaced by small batteries charged by cheaper hand-crank generators.|$|E
50|$|Radios {{powered by}} handcranked {{generators}} are not new, but their market was previously seen as limited to emergency or military organizations. The modern clockwork radio {{was designed and}} patented in 1991 by British inventor Trevor Baylis {{as a response to}} the AIDS crisis. He envisioned it as a radio for use by poor people in developing countries without access to batteries. In 1994, British accountant Chris Staines and his South African partner, Rory Stear, secured the worldwide license to the invention and cofounded Baygen Power Industries (now <b>Freeplay</b> Energy PLC), which produced the first commercial model. The key to its design was the use of a constant velocity spring to store the potential energy which are no longer in use. After Baylis lost control of his invention when Baygen became <b>Freeplay,</b> the <b>Freeplay</b> Energy units switched to disposable batteries charged by cheaper hand-crank generators.|$|E

In the same year Baylis met Queen Elizabeth II and Nelson Mandela at a state banquet, and also travelled to Africa with the Dutch Television Service to produce a documentary about his life. He was awarded the 1996 World Vision Award for Development Initiative that year.|$|E
