50|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Jacques Guerlain’s youngest son, Pierre, then 21 years old, was mobilized and fatally wounded in Baron along the River Oise. Guerlain was devastated and ceased creating for two years, also abandoning his stud in Normandy. At his estate in Les Mesnuls, he cultivated fruits and vegetables that he sent to his factory workers. In 1942 Guerlain returned with the perfume Kriss, named after an Indonesian dagger. The company’s factory in Bécon-les-Bruyères was destroyed by bombing the following year. Then, as the war drew to a close, Guerlain’s situation worsened when rumours spread of his apparent collaboration, all essentially unfounded. Guerlain {{fell into a deep}} depression. He re-released Kriss in 1945, renamed <b>Dawamesk</b> after a preparation of hashish.|$|E
40|$|Jacques-Joseph Moreau (de Tours) {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} pioneers of modern psychopharmacology. Born in 1804 in Montrésor, France, Moreau pursued medical studies in Tours and Paris, subsequently studying psychiatry under the tutelage of Jean Étienne Dominique Esquirol, whose eclectic approach to healing of the mind included the prescription of therapeutic travel. As part of his duties, Moreau ac-companied patients to the Orient, where he was able to observe the effects of, and partake himself of hashish, the resinous by-product of cannabis (Holmstedt 1973). Upon his return to France, Moreau investigated the therapeutic possibilities of this substance. He likely is the character known as ‘‘Dr. X’ ’ who provided hashish {{in the form of an}} electuary called <b>dawamesk</b> to literary illuminati such as Théophile Gautier, Charles Baudelaire, Alexandre Dumas and Honoré de Balzac of Le Club des Hachichins at the Hôtel Pimodan in Paris...|$|E
40|$|The {{studies on}} Witkacy’s oeuvre Narcotics (Narkotyki, 1932) exist without any {{specific}} status, as if {{reduced to a}} research element ancillary to other “more serious” creative areas of its author. The above is especially astonishing since they belong to a specific literary genre which was started with De Quincy’s Confessions of an Opium Eater (1821) and became really successful in the 19 th and 20 th centuries, with Baudelaire, Cocteau, Artaud, Huxley and many others. Witkacy was the first Polish writer who {{addressed the issue of}} drug addiction and wrote explicitly on the role of narcotics in artistic creation. He experimented with cocaine, mescaline, peyotl and discovered “the magic peyotl” in the same years as A. Artaud and W. Benjamin, and many years before Huxley. He {{was also one of the}} few writers who, after having experimented with drugs, began to deal with the theory of narcotics. The use of opium, cocaine, <b>dawamesk</b> also became a sort of caricatural form in many of his works from Cuttlefish (Mątwa) up to the novel The Only Way Out (Jedyne wyjście). The aim of my work is to try to answer several questions: In what way does the author’s interest in the addiction of Unwashed Souls (Niemyte dusze) fit into the 19 th and 20 th century debate between doctors, writers and European artists? Can Witkacy’s literary and dramatic work demonstrate that he was familiar with publications on pharmacology (published in Germany and France in the 20 s) and also with the authors who were writing about drugs in the 19 th and 20 th century? How does his prohibitionist point of view fit with his historiosophy? Can Narcotics be considered a literary work? I have also tried to determine the anonymous sources quoted by Witkacy and co-authors of Narcotics, B. Filipowski and S. Glass (pen name of Dezydery Prokopowicz) ...|$|E
