5|$|Once {{again in}} Buenos Aires, San Martín {{and his wife}} {{attended}} to the first official performance of the Argentine National Anthem, on 28 May 1813 at the Coliseo Theater. Oral tradition {{has it that the}} premiere took place on 14 May 1813 at the home of aristocrat Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson, with San Martín also attending, but there is no documentary <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> The lyrics of the new anthem included several references to the secessionist will of the time.|$|E
5|$|The main British attack {{started in}} the west on 19 September; the {{regiment}} remained in the Jordan Valley keeping patrols close to the Turkish positions to watch for any withdrawal. The first <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> was observed the next day, when the Turks retired from their forward positions. The regiment then moved to join {{the rest of the}} brigade at Khubret Fusail on the western bank of the Jordan.|$|E
25|$|When Birt gets up {{and says}} {{the whole of the}} BBC was a {{creative}} mess and it was wasteful, I never saw any <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> I absolutely know it wasn't so in my time. Producers now spend all their time worrying about money, and the thing has suffered for it.|$|E
60|$|The {{dead man}} lay--not neglected--only unwatched and alone, {{surrounded}} {{by all the}} <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> wealth which he had come {{a very long way}} to seek, but which Fate and a murderer's hand had snatched with appalling suddenness from him.|$|R

60|$|By noon {{they found}} {{themselves}} on Lake Cameron. On one shore were the grim <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> terrible forest fire which had nearly cost the saw mill robber and the Felps' crowd their lives. A few spots on the lake were clear, but at other points the snow lay from a few inches to {{a foot and a}} half deep.|$|R
25|$|The Shang had a fully {{developed}} system of writing, preserved on bronze inscriptions {{and a small}} number of other writings on pottery, jade and other stones, horn, etc., but most prolifically on oracle bones. The complexity and sophistication of this writing system indicates an earlier period of development, but direct <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> development is still lacking.|$|E
25|$|After the shuttle's breakup, {{there were}} some initial fears that terrorists might have been involved, but no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> has ever surfaced. Security {{surrounding}} the launch and landing {{of the space shuttle}} had been increased because the crew included the first Israeli astronaut. The Merritt Island launch facility, like all sensitive government areas, had increased security after the September 11 attacks.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{study of}} SOSUS {{data from the}} time of the {{incident}} has given rise to doubts of whether or not flooding preceded the reactor scram, as no sound of the high pressure water impacting the compartments of the submarine could be detected on instrument recordings from SOSUS at the time, which would have been a significant sonic event, and no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> can be found in the recorded data.|$|E

25|$|I don't {{think there}} is any {{evidence}} that there have been any renditions carried out in the country of Syria. There is no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> And I think we have to take what the secretary Condoleezza Rice says at face value. It is something very important, it is done very carefully and she has said we do not authorise, condone torture in any way, shape or form.|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} of Titus {{has always had}} a central role in criticism of the play insofar as those who doubt Shakespeare's authorship have often pointed to the apparent deficiencies in the language as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> claim. However, the quality of the language has had its defenders over the years, critics who argue that the play is more linguistically complex than is often thought, and features a more accomplished use of certain linguistic motifs than has hitherto been allowed for.|$|E
25|$|<b>Evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> fact came in 1939, when Newport {{reported}} to the Bureau that the exploder was giving unexplained prematures. Admiral Furlong arranged for a physicist to visit the station and investigate the failures. For approximately a week, the scientist and his assistants worked with the device. Four sources of prematures were uncovered. Even more significant, the investigator {{reported to}} the Bureau that the responsible engineers at Newport were not employing proper tests on the Mark 6. Corrective steps were ordered by the Chief, but subsequent events proved that the remedial action, like the original tests, was inadequate.|$|E

25|$|The glacial {{relief is}} typical {{for the highest}} zone {{of the park and}} dates from the Pleistocene. During the glacial periods the limits of the {{permanent}} snow cover were at 2200m. The glaciers melted down 10–12000 years ago. They were of Alpine type and descended into the valleys reaching as low as 1200–1300m. <b>Evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> limit are the moraines along the river Rilska at 1250m altitude. The most typical features from that period are the cirques found in the glacial valleys of Rilska and its tributaries. Many cirques contain lakes, such as the Smradlivo Lake, the largest glacial lake in the Balkans, or the Fish Lakes.|$|E
25|$|Alumni Hall {{dates back}} to 1848 and stands {{as one of the}} oldest {{structures}} on campus. The school was closed in 1861 due to the Civil War and reopened in 1865. In that time this hall {{is believed to have been}} used as a military hospital and potential <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> use, such as a pulley located at the top of the main stairwell for moving bodies up and down, can still be seen. The building was used as a hospital again for influenza patients after World War I. This history has led to rumors that the building is haunted, the most prominent being that a high-ranking Confederate officer captured at Gettysburg was treated in Alumni Hall and was murdered by a Union soldier in his sleep.|$|E
25|$|Another view held by many Protestants is sola fide ("by faith alone"): {{that faith}} alone, apart from any action, is what {{achieves}} salvation, and that good works are merely <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> faith. Justification is generally {{seen as a}} discrete event that takes place once for all during one's lifetime, {{not the result of}} a transformation of character. However, most Protestants teach that a transformation of character naturally follows the salvation experience. Instead of distinguishing between mortal and venial sins, Protestants believe that one's faith dictates one's state of salvation and one's place in the afterlife. Those who have been saved by God are destined for heaven, while those have not been saved will be excluded from heaven. Accordingly, they reject any notion of a provisional or temporary afterlife state such as purgatory.|$|E
50|$|Another {{complaint}} was {{the absence of}} the play-within-the-play. Though much is made <b>of</b> <b>that</b> play's immense impact, there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> what <b>that</b> play actually says, proclaims, describes, or portrays that would produce such an effect.|$|R
60|$|They turned round, but as {{they neared}} {{the middle of the}} paddock {{progress}} became almost impossible. The bell had rung for the principal race of the day and the numbers were going up. The paddock was crowded with others beside loiterers, looking the horses over and stolidly pushing their way through the little groups to the front rank. From Tattersall's came the roar of clamorous voices. All around were <b>evidences</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> excitement which always precedes a great race.|$|R
50|$|The 20th-century philosopher of {{religion}} Richard Swinburne argued in his book, Simplicity as <b>Evidence</b> <b>of</b> Truth, <b>that</b> these arguments are only strong when collected together, and <b>that</b> individually each <b>of</b> them is weak.|$|R
500|$|David Jaffe, {{creator and}} Game Director of the {{original}} God of War, spoke with NowGamer prior to the first press announcement in late April. He {{said that if he}} had worked on Ascension, he would have incorporated three specific elements: different myths, a co-star, and [...] "look to the Zelda structure as a jumping off point". He liked the idea of a cooperative mode, and added [...] "I'd love to see player one be Kratos and player two be this stupid annoying sidekick that—for some to be determined story reason—Kratos is stuck with for the whole adventure and in the end, once the main quest is over, Kratos just snaps the poor kid's neck". In May 2012, Jaffe spoke with IGN about the multiplayer element: [...] "I think it looks cool. It looks like another great, impeccably executed Sony Santa Monica game", and added, [...] "If {{it turns out to be}} the case that the single player is watered down because of , then I think they have some justification. But I don't see any <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> and I don't see <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> based on the team they are." ...|$|E
500|$|The Schiavo {{case has}} been {{compared}} to the Karen Ann Quinlan case and Nancy Cruzan case, two landmark right-to-die cases. Quinlan entered a persistent vegetative state in 1975, and her family was allowed to remove her from a ventilator in 1976 after a ruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court based on her right of privacy. She died of pneumonia in 1985. Cruzan was diagnosed with PVS in 1983 and her legal case reached the Supreme Court, which ruled that [...] "clear and convincing evidence" [...] of her wishes to die under such circumstances was needed. Cruzan's family did not have enough <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> but later produced more. She died after being removed from life support in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Cowell, who had {{encountered}} Ornstein while studying in New York, would pursue a similarly radical style {{as part of}} a grand intellectual and cultural mission, which also involved ambitious writings on music theory and publishing and promotional efforts in support of the avant-garde. Ornstein, the vanguard iconoclast of American classical music, followed a much more idiosyncratic muse: [...] "I'm guided entirely by just my musical instinct as to what I feel is consequential or inconsequential." [...] <b>Evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> is the fact that, even {{at the height of his}} ultra-modernist notoriety, he also wrote several lyrical, tonal works, such as the First Sonata for Cello and Piano: [...] " [...] was written in less than a week under a compulsion that was not to be resisted", Ornstein later said. [...] "Why I should have heard this romantic piece at the same period that I was tumultuously involved in the primitivism of [...] is beyond my understanding." [...] Commenting on the piece after Ornstein's death approximately three-quarters of a century later, critic Martin Anderson wrote that it [...] "rivals Rachmaninov's [...] in gorgeous tunes." ...|$|E

2500|$|The very {{earliest}} {{precious metals}} had mixes {{of gold and}} silver; gold and silver alloy is called electrum. With the advent of coinage, methods had to be invented to remove impurities from the gold so that gold of specific purities could be made. Cupellation was able to remove gold and silver from mixtures containing lead and other metals, but silver could not be removed. Gold parting as a process was specifically invented to remove the silver. The main ancient process of gold parting was by salt cementation and there is archaeological <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> process from the 6th century BC in Sardis, Lydia. [...] In the post-medieval period parting using antimony, sulfates and mineral acids was also used. In the modern period chlorination using the Miller process, and electrolysis using the Wohlwill process are {{the most widely used}} methods of refining gold by removing silver and platinum.|$|E
2500|$|Less than a {{year later}} the Assembly of Year XIII {{estimated}} that the song was not effective enough to serve as a national anthem. On 6 March 1813 several poets were asked to submit lyrics. The poem by the lawyer Vicente López y Planes was unanimously considered the best. It was approved as the [...] "sole national march" [...] (...) on May 11, 1813. Parera was asked to compose a new musical setting around the same date. He must have finished the piece in a few days. Oral tradition has it that the premiere took place on May 14, 1813 at the home of the aristocrat Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson, but there is no documentary <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> If this episode is true, then Parera, contrary to certain misconceptions, wrote quickly and under no visible coercion. The published song sheet is dated 14 May 1813. He again conducted the official premiere in the theater on May 28, and was paid 200 pesos.|$|E
2500|$|Kabul {{is located}} between Latitude 34-31' North and Longitude 69-12' East at an {{altitude}} of 1800 m (6000feet) above sea level, which makes it one of the world's highest capital cities. Kabul is strategically situated in a valley surrounded by high mountains at crossroads of north-south and east-west trade routes. One million years ago the Kabul region was surrounded from south-east between Lowgar and Paghman Mountains; Charikar in the north and the Ningai Ghar mountains in the west. This region formed an icy sea. [...] Some deep wells in the region of today's Poli Charkhi in the east part of city are the <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> time. Kabul is surrounded by Koh-e Paghman Mountain from the east, Koh-e Qrough Mountain from the south-west and Koh-e Shirdarwaza Mountain from the north-east. Kabul has only one river which is called Kabul River. Kabul River rises at the Paghman Mountain toward South Pass about [...] west of Kabul. It flows in an easterly direction, past Kabul, and through Jalalabad city, and then on to Dakka where it enters Pakistani territory and finally runs into the Indus at Attock.|$|E
5000|$|A {{commentator}} {{criticized the}} Court's opinion as [...] "making a deep incursion upon {{basic principles of}} federalism" [...] by re-characterizing <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> conduct <b>that</b> the Court deemed protected activity as [...] "no evidence" [...] of crime.|$|R
25|$|The {{other type}} <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> is <b>that</b> <b>of</b> bite marks, left {{on either the}} victim (by the attacker), the {{perpetrator}} (from the victim of an attack), or on an object found at the crime scene. Bite marks are often found on children who are abused.|$|R
25|$|The authors {{point out}} that their {{analysis}} is completely consistent with the supposition that a non-black non-raven provides an extremely small amount <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> although they do not attempt to prove it; they merely calculate {{the difference between the}} amount <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> a black raven provides and the amount <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> a non-black non-raven provides.|$|R
