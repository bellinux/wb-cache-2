50|$|Consistent {{with the}} example {{illustrated}} above, a <b>grading</b> <b>curve</b> allows academic institutions {{to ensure the}} distribution of students across certain grade point average (GPA) thresholds. As many professors establish the curve to target a course average of a C, the corresponding grade point average equivalent would be a 2.0 on a standard 4.0 scale employed at most North American universities.

Grading curves serve to attach additional significance to these figures, and the specific distribution employed may vary between academic institutions.|$|E

50|$|However, curved grading can {{increase}} competitiveness {{between students and}} affect their sense of faculty fairness in a class. Students are generally most upset in {{the case that the}} curve lowered their grade compared to what they would have received if a curve was not used. To ensure that this does not happen, teachers usually put forth effort to ensure that the test itself is hard enough when they intend to use a <b>grading</b> <b>curve,</b> such that they would expect the average student to get a lower raw score that the score intended to be used at the average in the curve, thus ensuring that all students benefit from the curve. Thus, curved grades cannot be blindly used and must be carefully considered and pondered compared to alternatives such as criterion-referenced grading. Furthermore, constant misuse of curved grading can adjust grades on poorly designed tests, whereas assessments should be designed to accurately reflect the learning objectives set by the instructor.|$|E

40|$|The <b>grading</b> <b>curve</b> of an {{aggregate}} {{is a fundamental}} characteristic for mix design that can easily be modified to adjust several mix properties. While sieve analysis remains the reference method to determine this curve, optical devices are developing, allowing easier and faster assessment of aggregate grading.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} median indicator kriging and full indicator kriging {{in the analysis of}} gold mineralisation data from the Goodall gold mine in the Northern Territory of Australia. The sample data used in this study consist of exploration drilling data, suitably composited, taken from the 540 mRL bench of the main open cut. The data set is sparse, irregularly spaced and has a highly skewed distribution. An enlarged data set, used for the variography, was obtained by including exploration data from 20 m above and 20 m below the bench. In addition, the blast hole data from the chosen bench were considered as a model of reality. Careful choice of the common semivariogram model for median indicator kriging was necessary. <b>Grade</b> tonnage <b>curves</b> from median indicator kriging and full indicator kriging were compared with one another and with the <b>grade</b> tonnage <b>curve</b> of the blast hole data.

40|$|Granular {{segregation}} is {{an important}} mechanism for industrial processes aiming at mixing grains. Additionally, it plays {{a pivotal role in}} determining the kinematics of geophysical flows. Because of segregation, the grainsize distribution varies in space and time. Additional complications arise from the presence of comminution, where new particles are created, enhancing segregation. This has a feedback on the comminution process, as particles change their local neighbourhood. Simultaneously, particles are generally undergoing remixing, further complicating the segregation and comminution processes. The interaction between these mechanisms is explored using a cellular automaton with three rules: one for each of segregation, comminution and mixing. The interplay between these rules creates complex patterns, as seen in segregating systems, and depth dependent <b>grading</b> <b>curves,</b> which have been observed in avalanche runout.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the relationship between measured rheology and proportioning properties with particular attention to maximum packing fraction, thickness of fiber lubricating matrix and fiber rotational overlap.
