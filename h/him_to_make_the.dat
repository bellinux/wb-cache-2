5|$|In {{planning}} for Apollo 8, {{one of the}} responsibilities Kraft faced was ensuring that a fleet would be waiting to recover the crew when they splashed {{down at the end}} of the mission. This proved an unusual challenge, because much of the Pacific fleet of the US Navy would be on leave over the Christmas and New Year's Eve period. Kraft had to personally meet with Admiral John McCain in order to persuade <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> requisite resources available to NASA.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland {{and a lot of}} new designs and backgrounds had to be created for the wilderness scenes. The backgrounds were designed by animator Debbie Silver. The design of the forest ranger was based on then-Vice President Al Gore. In the episode, Marge watches an old film which includes a comment from naturalist John Muir. The impression of Muir was done by Dan Castellaneta, who originally based the voice on an impersonator he met at Yosemite National Park. However, the producers asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> voice older and crazier.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> player character's death almost impossible, {{which meant that}} gameplay focused the game on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.|$|E

5|$|The Archbishop of Canterbury, Ralph d'Escures, {{refused to}} consecrate Thurstan unless the archbishop-elect made a {{profession}} of {{obedience to the}} southern see. This {{was part of the}} long-running Canterbury-York dispute, which started in 1070. Thurstan refused to make such a profession, and asked the king for permission to go to Rome to consult Pope Paschal II. Henry I refused to allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> journey, but even without a personal appeal from Thurstan, Paschal decided against Canterbury. At the Council of Salisbury in 1116 the English king ordered Thurstan to submit to Canterbury, but instead Thurstan publicly resigned the archibishopric. On his way to the Council, Thurstan had received letters from Paschal II that supported York and commanded that he should be consecrated without a profession. Similar letters had gone to Ralph d'Escures from the pope, ordering Ralph, as Archbishop of Canterbury, to consecrate Thurstan. After the news of the letters became public, Thurstan's resignation was ignored, and he continued to be considered the archbishop-elect.|$|E

25|$|Les Jackson was {{genuinely}} quick from a slingy action, and remarkably accurate and economical. He {{was able to}} swing the ball both ways and move off the seam, and his six-foot height enabled <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> ball lift awkwardly from just short of a length.

The film was not made but Fleischer instead directed two other stories for Zanuck starring Greco, Crack in the Mirror (1960) and The Big Gamble (1961).|$|E

Some of these early filmed sessions were later released on the Led Zeppelin DVD (2003). They were part of manager Peter Grant's early strategy to build public awareness of the group. However, his dissatisfaction with the medium (particularly its inferior audio quality), would soon lead <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> band unavailable for television again.|$|E

Ronaldinho captained the team, and he scored his only two goals in a 5–0 victory over New Zealand before Brazil were beaten by Argentina in the semi-final. Brazil finished with the bronze medal after defeating Belgium 3–0 in the bronze medal match.|$|E

25|$|Union Major General Benjamin Butler, {{commanding}} the Army of the James in Fort Monroe, learned that General Robert E. Lee had detached {{a small portion}} of the Army of Northern Virginia to North Carolina. Convinced that Lee had sent a larger detachment than he actually did, Butler was convinced that an attack by the Army of the Potomac would force Lee to use troops from the defenses of Richmond to ward off the attack. Major General John Sedgwick, temporarily {{commanding the}} Army of the Potomac, protested that Lee had detached fewer men than Butler thought and that the local roads and weather were too poor for a winter attack. However, both Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and general-in-chief Henry W. Halleck overruled his objections and ordered <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> attack on February 6.|$|E
25|$|In January 1937, the Spanish Republican {{government}} commissioned Picasso {{to create}} a large mural for the Spanish display at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne at the 1937 World's Fair in Paris. At the time, Picasso was living in Paris, {{where he had been}} named Honorary Director-in-Exile of the Prado Museum. He had last visited Spain in 1934 and never returned. His initial sketches for the project, on which he worked somewhat dispassionately from January until late April, depicted his perennial theme of the artist's studio. Immediately upon hearing reports of the 26 April bombing of Guernica, the poet Juan Larrea visited Picasso and urged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> bombing his subject. However, it was only on 1 May, having read George Steer's eyewitness account of the bombing (originally published in both The Times and The New York Times on 28 April), that he abandoned his initial project and started sketching a series of preliminary drawings for Guernica.|$|E
25|$|In autumn 2011, Chibnall pitched Broadchurch to Laura Mackie, the Head of Drama at ITV, who proved very {{enthusiastic}} about the proposal. Just days after she finished reading the scripts, she suggested Chibnall work with Kudos Film and Television, a well-known production company. Kudos immediately agreed to produce the series. Mackie then brought the show to ITV Director of Television Peter Fincham, who green-lit the project almost immediately. ITV wanted the series to air in early 2013, which meant that filming had {{to occur in the}} summer of 2012. That gave Broadchurch a much shorter pre-production schedule that usual. ITV wanted a high-quality series despite the time constraint. According to Chibnall, ITV advised <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> series as bold as possible and to ignore commercial considerations. Fincham and Chibnall discussed stripping Broadchurch over a series of four or five nights, rather than as a weekly program. But both men rejected the idea. Fincham was keen to allow speculation to build over time, and to give viewers a chance to engage in conversation about each episode before the next one aired.|$|E

25|$|Mike Smith {{was kept}} as captain {{for only the}} First Test of the 1966 series against a West Indian side held {{together}} by the superb all round skills of their captain Gary Sobers. Sobers won the toss at Old Trafford, batted first and caught England on a spinning wicket for an innings victory, Cowdrey making 69 in the debacle. Smith was dismissed as captain and dropped from the side due to his well-known weakness to the West Indian fast bowlers. Cowdrey was placed in charge, which he accepted reluctantly due to the shoddy treatment of his friend and predecessor. In the Second Test at Lords England were 86 runs ahead in the first innings with the West Indies 95/5 when Sobers and his cousin David Holford added 274 to save the game. Cowdrey was criticised for not surrounding Sobers with fielders {{at the beginning of}} his innings, but he maintained that by spreading the field he encouraged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> strokes which could have got him out, but there was little doubt that the plan failed.|$|E
25|$|In February 1975, {{during his}} {{engagement}} in Las Vegas, Presley met with Barbra Streisand and Jon Peters. They discussed {{the possibility of}} Presley's co-starring with Streisand in a remake of the film A Star is Born. Seeing it {{as a chance to}} finally be taken seriously as an actor, Presley agreed to take the role if the contracts could be worked out. According to Presley's friend, Jerry Schilling, Presley was excited about the opportunity to take on a new challenge. Streisand's production company, First Artists, offered Presley $500,000 and 10% of the profits. Parker, who had always dealt with Presley's film contracts and viewed the offer as a starting bid, asked for $1 million, 50% of the profits, $100,000 for expenses, and spoke of needing to arrange details of a soundtrack deal. First Artists, unused to such huge demands, didn't put forward a counteroffer and decided instead to offer the role to Kris Kristofferson. Parker later claimed that Presley had asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> contract so demanding so that they would not offer him the part, although many of Presley's friends have said he was furious at losing the role.|$|E
25|$|Just {{prior to}} the Canucks' 23-man roster being set {{following}} the end of preseason, they claimed defenceman Ryan Stanton off waivers. Stanton had played only one NHL game but was brought in as a possible replacement for Alberts in order to keep a balance between right and left handed defencemen. The youth movement failed to take hold. Guance was sent back to the Belleville Bulls. Despite having a good camp, he was outplayed by fellow prospects, Horvat and Shinkaruk. Tortorella felt Gaunce needed to improve the tempo and the pace of his game and he would benefit from playing more minutes. Due to the injuries and suspensions, it appeared that Horvat and Shinkaruk would start the season with the Canucks. However, just days before the roster was set, Vancouver acquired forwards Zac Dalpe and Jeremy Welsh from the Carolina Hurricanes. Following the trade Horvat was sent back to the London Knights, Shinkaruk remained with the team, but was returned to the Medicine Hat Tigers to make room for Stanton. As {{with the rest of the}} prospects, Vancouver was pleased with their play, but wanted to do what was best for their development. Helping to make the decision to return the prospects to their junior teams was the emergence of Mike Santorelli who had a strong camp, where he was one of Vancouver's best forwards. He earned Tortorella's trust and was played in all situations helping <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> team.|$|E
