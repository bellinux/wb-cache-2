25|$|Through 21 CFR 1040, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates laser {{products}} entering {{commerce and}} requires all classIIIb and classIV lasers offered in commerce in the US to have five standard safety features: a <b>key</b> <b>switch,</b> a safety interlock dongle, a power indicator, an aperture shutter, and an emission delay (normally {{two to three}} seconds). OEM lasers, designed to be parts of other components (such as DVD burners), are exempt from this requirement. Some non-portable lasers {{may not have a}} safety dongle or an emission delay, but have an emergency stop button and/or a remote switch.|$|E
25|$|A Class 3B laser is {{hazardous}} if the eye {{is exposed}} directly, but diffuse reflections such as those from paper or other matte surfaces are not harmful. The AEL for continuous lasers in the wavelength range from 315nm to far infrared is 0.5W. For pulsed lasers between 400 and 700nm, the limit is 30mJ. Other limits apply to other wavelengths and to ultrashort pulsed lasers. Protective eyewear is typically required where direct viewing of a class3B laser beam may occur. Class-3B lasers must be equipped with a <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> and a safety interlock. Class3B lasers are used inside CD and DVD writers, although the writer unit itself is class1 because the laser light cannot leave the unit.|$|E

25|$|Class 4 is {{the highest}} and most {{dangerous}} class of laser, including all lasers that exceed the Class3B AEL. By definition, a class4 laser can burn the skin, or cause devastating and permanent eye damage {{as a result of}} direct, diffuse or indirect beam viewing. These lasers may ignite combustible materials, and thus may represent a fire risk. These hazards may also apply to indirect or non-specular reflections of the beam, even from apparently matte surfaces meaning that great care must be taken to control the beam path. Class4 lasers must be equipped with a <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> and a safety interlock. Most industrial, scientific, military, and medical lasers are in this category. Medical lasers can have divergent emissions and require awareness of nominal ocular hazard distance (NOHD) and nominal ocular hazard area (NOHA).|$|E
2500|$|From 1971 to 1976, Buick's {{full-sized}} Estate Wagon {{shared the}} [...] wheelbase and 455 cubic-inch V8 with the Electra 225, and shared its {{interior and exterior}} styling from 1971 to 1974 (complete with the prerequisite four VentiPorts). And although from 1975 to 1976 the number of VentiPorts were reduced by one, and the front fascia was downgraded to a LeSabre's, the Electra 225 style chrome rocker panel moldings and distinctive Electra 225 style rear quarter panels (albeit without fender skirts) remained. These were the first Buick station wagons to be built on Buick's largest chassis since the Roadmaster Estates of 1947–53. The Estate Wagons, as did other GM full-sized wagons during these years, used a unique rear suspension with multi-leaf springs instead of the coil springs used on other full-sized Buicks, and other full-sized GM cars. The Estate Wagons also featured a new 'clamshell' tailgate design where the rear power-operated glass slid up into the roof as the tailgate (manually or with power assist), slid into a recess under the cargo floor. The power tailgate, the first in station wagon history, ultimately supplanted the manual tailgate, which required marked effort to lift from storage. It was operated by switches on the instrument panel or a <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> on the rear quarter panel. The clamshell system, heavy and complex, {{made it easier to}} load and unload the extremely long wagons in tight spaces. But it remained un-adopted by any other manufacturer, and would be eliminated when GM reduced the length of their wagons by about a foot in 1977, and the overriding concern became increased fuel economy.|$|E

50|$|Once the {{elevator}} {{arrives at the}} floor, it will park with its doors open and the car buttons will be disabled to prevent a passenger from taking control of {{the elevator}}. Medical personnel must then activate the code-blue <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> inside the car, select their floor and close the doors with the door close button. The elevator will then travel non-stop to the selected floor, and will remain in code-blue service until switched off in the car. Some hospital elevators will feature a 'hold' position on the code-blue <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> (similar to fire service) which allows the elevator to remain at a floor locked out of service until code blue is deactivated.|$|E

50|$|Phase-two mode {{can only}} be {{activated}} by a <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> located inside the elevator on the centralized control panel. This mode was created for firefighters {{so that they may}} rescue people from a burning building. The phase-two <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> located on the COP has three positions: off, on, and hold. By turning phase two on, the firefighter enables the car to move. However, like independent-service mode, the car will not respond to a car call unless the firefighter manually pushes and holds the door close button. Once the elevator gets to the desired floor it will not open its doors unless the firefighter holds the door open button. This is in case the floor is burning and the firefighter can feel the heat and knows not to open the door. The firefighter must hold door open until the door is completely opened. If for any reason the firefighter wishes to leave the elevator, they will use the hold position on the <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> to make sure the elevator remains at that floor. If the firefighter wishes to return to the recall floor, they simply turn the key off and close the doors.|$|E
50|$|The top row of keys, {{including}} {{the escape key}} and function keys, are small soft-touch keys with membrane dome switches. The remaining keys are standard size and {{each has its own}} Cherry MX brown <b>key</b> <b>switch,</b> providing a tactile feel, but no click. A piezo buzzer provides optional key click.|$|E
5000|$|A {{stop switch}} (not allowed under British regulations) {{to halt the}} {{elevator}} while in motion and often used to hold an elevator open while freight is loaded. Keeping an elevator stopped for too long may set off an alarm. Unless local codes require otherwise, this {{will most likely be}} a <b>key</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Call {{buttons to}} choose a floor. Some of these may be <b>key</b> <b>switches</b> (to control access). In some elevators, certain floors are {{inaccessible}} unless one swipes a security card or enters a passcode (or both).|$|R

50|$|To provide longer {{lighting}} {{times when}} required the button may be pressed repeatedly. For this reason any timer {{should be a}} retriggerable monostable, i.e. the off delay lasts {{from the time of}} the last button press. There may also be a switch, sometimes a <b>key</b> <b>switch,</b> that can turn the lights on indefinitely for tasks such as cleaning.|$|E
50|$|This {{starting}} method inspired Porsche {{to locate the}} ignition <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> {{to the left of}} the steering wheel. In a left-hand drive car, this allowed the driver to use his left hand to start the engine, and his right hand to put the transmission into gear, which in turn shaves off a few tenths of a second.|$|E
5000|$|Institutional {{shareholders}} {{are increasingly}} {{calling for an}} end to staggered boards of directors—also called [...] "declassifying" [...] the boards. The Wall Street Journal reported in January 2007 that 2006 marked a <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> in the trend toward declassification or annual votes on all directors: more than half (55%) of the S&P 500 companies have declassified boards, compared with 47% in 2005.|$|E

50|$|Phase one mode is {{activated}} by a corresponding smoke sensor or heat sensor in the building. Once an alarm has been activated, the elevator will automatically go into phase one. The elevator will wait {{an amount of}} time, then proceed to go into nudging mode to tell everyone the elevator is leaving the floor. Once the elevator has left the floor, depending on where the alarm was set off, the elevator {{will go to the}} fire-recall floor. However, if the alarm was activated on the fire-recall floor, the elevator will have an alternate floor to recall to. When the elevator is recalled, it proceeds to the recall floor and stops with its doors open. The elevator will no longer respond to calls or move in any direction. Located on the fire-recall floor is a fire-service <b>key</b> <b>switch.</b> The fire-service <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> has the ability to turn fire service off, turn fire service on or to bypass fire service. The only way to return the elevator to normal service is to switch it to bypass after the alarms have reset.|$|E
5000|$|Elevators {{often have}} a red two-way button on the control panel which is either marked [...] "Emergency Stop" [...] or [...] "Run/Stop". Normally, the button is in the [...] "up" [...] or unpushed position, {{allowing}} the elevator to [...] "run" [...] in normal service. When the button is pushed, the elevator comes to an immediate stop. When the button is pulled back out, it resumes normal service, thus {{the reason for the}} use of the phrase [...] "Run/Stop". Escalators will typically have a key-operated control that will turn the escalator off, or change its direction to up or down. Next to the <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> will be a red [...] "Emergency Stop" [...] button, which is used in the event of equipment failure, or where there is a potential for injury, such as when someone's shoe gets stuck in the [...] "comb" [...] at the top or bottom of the escalator and there is a risk of serious injury. The <b>key</b> <b>switch</b> is used to return the escalator to service after it has been stopped.|$|E
