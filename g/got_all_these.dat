2500|$|Alan Dale portrays Caleb Nichol (season 2, {{recurring}} season 1), Kirsten's businessman {{father and}} later Julie Cooper's husband. His character recurs throughout the first season, and {{he becomes a}} regular during the second season, but comes to a sudden stop when his character suffers from a fatal heart attack during the season 2 finale. The Chicago Tribune characterised Caleb as a [...] "gruff, uncompromising Newport Beach, Calif., real-estate developer". When asked by the Tribune about the character, Dale said, [...] ""The thing that's lovely about this character is that there's {{so much to do}} with him. His relationships are so complicated, and once the marriage happened, everyone was related in the show. That means he's <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> people to relate to, and he relates so badly with everyone." ...|$|E

[...] "You’ve <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> different songs and different styles and different musical experimentations. It becomes a big mess..." [...] It quickly became clear that {{very few of the}} experimental tracks were going to make the record, with producer Elizondo telling the band to not [...] "be afraid of what you've done for the past six records". In the end, the band decided to go in the direction of making [...] "a statement" [...] and defining who they are in an independent era, [...] "and that’s when it came down to what are the songs saying and which ones mean the most to us." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Swedish magazine Bon, Robyn announced that she had plans to release three new albums in 2010. She said, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> great songs so why not? [...] It's been 5 years since Robyn and I didn't want to wait with a release until they are all recorded, so I decided to start putting them out right away." [...] Robyn told Popjustice journalist Peter Robinson, [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since I actually made a record! And I was thinking of how to shorten that time down and Eric, my manager, came up with the idea of what if I just start releasing songs, then I can tour them, then I can make some more songs. We started working like that. I think once it starts it will make more sense– you can just keep releasing stuff without the long breaks." [...] Robyn collaborated with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song [...] "Time Machine". Martin was responsible for producing Robyn's US breakthrough hits [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", which both charted inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996 and 1997. She said of the collaboration: [...] "It was nostalgic to go back into the studio together. For me, it’s perfect timing– I’ve come full circle. It’s a way for me to show that I’m not trying to distance myself from where I come from. It’s still all about the songs." ...|$|E

They treated her with admiring deference. She answered to some need of theirs. They sat at her feet. They were like disciples. It was very curious. Of Fyne they took but scanty notice.

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{importance}} of the robot for the elderly and the disabled, a quadruped walking robot using 3 -RPS parallel mechanism as the basic leg mechanism is proposed. The structure of the basic leg is described, and the whole structure of the quadruped walking robot is formed. Then taking the workspace of the basic leg as the standard, the optimum size parameters of the upper platform and the lower platform of the based leg are achieved. Meanwhile the workspace of the basic leg is obtained by the anti-solution search method. Taking the basic leg as analysis object and applying the virtual organization method, the kinematic expression is <b>got.</b> <b>All</b> of <b>these</b> analyses lay a theoretical foundation for the further study on the quadruped walking robot with parallel leg mechanism...|$|R
60|$|When {{the youth}} had <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> {{directions}} {{as to what}} he had to do when he got ashore again the next thing was to remember the words which the troll said when he changed him from a human being to an animal; but these he had forgotten, and the girl did not know them either. He went about all day in despair, and thought and thought, but he could not remember what they sounded like. During the night he could not sleep, until towards morning he fell into a slumber, and all at once it flashed upon him what the troll used to say. He made haste to repeat the words, and at the same moment he became a fish again and slipped out into the sea. Immediately after this he was called upon, and swam through the sea up the river to where the troll stood on the bank and restored him to human shape with the same words as before.|$|E

A good girl {{will be able to}} be happy and {{contented}} without that. But a lone life is a poor life, and a good husband is about the best blessing that a young woman can have." [...] To this proposition Mary perhaps agreed in her own mind but she gave no spoken assent. [...] "Now this young man that is wanting to marry you has <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things, and as far as I can judge with my experience in the world, is as likely to make a good husband as any one I know." [...] He paused for an answer but Mary could only lean close upon his arm and be silent. [...] "Have you anything to say about it, my dear? You see it has been going on now a long time, and of course he'll look to have it decided." [...] But still she could say nothing. [...] "Well, now;--he has been with me to-day." ...|$|E

Pushing his feet in at the upper opening, Rooney writhed, thrust, and wriggled himself into it, being ably assisted by his attendants, who held open the sleeves for him and expanded the tight elastic cuffs, and, catching the dress at the neck, hitched it upwards so powerfully as almost to lift their patient off his legs. Next, came a pair of outside stockings and canvas overalls or short trousers, {{both of which were}} meant to preserve the dress-proper from injury.

60|$|And {{even while}} {{they seemed to}} hear the heavy feet of their strange pursuers behind them, they had to stand and stamp while the French Colonel talked to the French wood-cutter with all the leisurely badinage and bickering of market-day. At {{the end of the}} four minutes, however, they saw that the Colonel was right, for the wood-cutter entered into their plans, not with the vague servility of a tout too-well paid, but with the {{seriousness}} of a solicitor who had been paid the proper fee. He told them that the best thing they could do was to make their way down to the little inn on the hills above Lancy, where the innkeeper, an old soldier who had become devout in his latter years, would be certain to sympathise with them, and even to take risks in their support. The whole company, therefore, piled themselves on top of the stacks of wood, and went rocking in the rude cart down the other and steeper side of the woodland. Heavy and ramshackle as was the vehicle, it was driven quickly enough, and they soon had the exhilarating impression of distancing altogether those, whoever they were, who were hunting them. For, after all, the riddle as to where the anarchists had <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> followers was still unsolved. One man's presence had sufficed for them; they had fled at the first sight of the deformed smile of the Secretary. Syme every now and then looked back {{over his shoulder at the}} army on their track.|$|E

Of course production has fallen off very greatly, and {{the sale of}} Egyptian products at Cairo, to the troops, has been considerable. Then, too, the disturbed state {{of the country has}} prevented the manufacturers from sending valuable goods down here, so that practically that part of the business has been at a standstill, and I have not attempted to accumulate a stock. However I have lately purchased many large lots from native traders here who feared that their shops might be pillaged {{in the event of a}} riot, and especially lately when they were afraid that if your people took the town by storm there might be a general sack. So as I was certain that the French must go before long, and I <b>got</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> goods at a bargain, I have bought freely. Then I have not done badly with goods run in by French ships that managed to slip through the blockade, and which were laden with speculative cargoes of luxuries for the army. As we are almost the only European house open, and I was able to pay cash, I bought things up largely, and realized very good profits by supplying the native shops here and the officers of the garrison, and also sent a great deal of wine and goods of that sort up to Cairo, getting leave from the commandant here for them to go up under the guard of any body of troops that happened to be proceeding there, so that altogether the firm had not done badly, all things considered." ...|$|E
