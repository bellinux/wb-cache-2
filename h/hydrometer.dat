25|$|The {{classification}} of fine-grained soils, i.e., soils that are finer than sand, is determined primarily by their Atterberg limits, not by their grain size. If {{it is important}} to determine the grain size distribution of fine-grained soils, the <b>hydrometer</b> test may be performed. In the <b>hydrometer</b> tests, the soil particles are mixed with water and shaken to produce a dilute suspension in a glass cylinder, and then the cylinder is left to sit. A <b>hydrometer</b> is used to measure the density of the suspension as a function of time. Clay particles may take several hours to settle past the depth of measurement of the <b>hydrometer.</b> Sand particles may take less than a second. Stoke's law provides the theoretical basis to calculate the relationship between sedimentation velocity and particle size. ASTM provides the detailed procedures for performing the <b>Hydrometer</b> test.|$|E
25|$|A more {{reliable}} method of determinating the alcoholic strength {{is to use}} scientific testing equipment, such as an alcoholmeter or <b>hydrometer.</b> A <b>hydrometer</b> is used {{during and after the}} fermentation process to determine the potential alcohol percent of the moonshine, whereas an alcoholmeter is used after the product has been distilled to determine the volume percent or proof.|$|E
25|$|Particle-size {{analysis}} : This is done {{to determine}} the soil gradation. Coarser particles are separated in the sieve analysis portion, and the finer particles are analyzed with a <b>hydrometer.</b> The distinction between coarse and fine particles is usually made at 75 μm. The sieve analysis shakes the sample through progressively smaller meshes to determine its gradation. The <b>hydrometer</b> analysis uses the rate of sedimentation to determine particle gradation.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hydrometers</b> {{are simple}} but {{effective}} instruments {{for measuring the}} density of liquids. In this work, we present the new hydrostatic weighing system developed at the INRiM, formerly IMGC – CNR, for the calibration of <b>hydrometers</b> in the range 500 kg. m- 3 to 2000 kg. m- 3. The apparatus which uses a method to automatically align specific scale-marks for the calibration of <b>hydrometers,</b> makes easy the whole calibration procedure and allows to reduce the former uncertainty declared by laboratory. It consists of a vision system, a stepping motor, and software to control the system. The vision system, composed of a CCD camera and a frame grabber, is used to acquire images. The overall performance of the apparatus {{is illustrated by the}} assessment of the uncertainty for some usual kinds of <b>hydrometers</b> sent to the Institute for calibration...|$|R
40|$|After a brief {{description}} of the different methods employed in periodic calibration of <b>hydrometers</b> used in most cases to measure the density of liquids in the range between 500 kg m− 3 and 2000 kg m− 3, particular emphasis is given to the multipoint procedure based on hydrostatic weighing, known as well as Cuckow's method. The features of the calibration apparatus and the procedure used at the INRiM (formerly IMGC-CNR) density laboratory have been considered to assess all relevant contributions involved in the calibration of different kinds of <b>hydrometers.</b> The uncertainty is strongly dependent on the kind of hydrometer; in particular, the results highlight the importance of the density of the reference buoyant liquid, the temperature of calibration and the skill of operator in the reading of the scale in the whole assessment of the uncertainty. It is also interesting to realize that for high-resolution <b>hydrometers</b> (division of 0. 1 kg m− 3), the uncertainty contribution of the density of the reference liquid is the main source of the total uncertainty, but its importance falls under about 50 % for <b>hydrometers</b> with a division of 0. 5 kg m− 3 and becomes somewhat negligible for <b>hydrometers</b> with a division of 1 kg m− 3, for which the reading uncertainty is the predominant part of the total uncertainty. At present the best INRiM result is obtained with commercially available <b>hydrometers</b> having a scale division of 0. 1 kg m− 3, for which the relative uncertainty is about 12 × 10 − 6...|$|R

25|$|The <b>hydrometer</b> {{transformed}} how beer was brewed. Before {{its introduction}} beers were brewed {{from a single}} malt: brown beers from brown malt, amber beers from amber malt, pale beers from pale malt. Using the <b>hydrometer,</b> brewers could calculate the yield from different malts. They observed that pale malt, though more expensive, yielded far more fermentable material than cheaper malts. For example, brown malt (used for Porter) gave 54 pounds of extract per quarter, whilst pale malt gave 80 pounds. Once this was known, brewers switched to using mostly pale malt for all beers supplemented with a small quantity of highly coloured malt to achieve the correct colour for darker beers.|$|E

25|$|Breweries and biofuel plants employ {{two methods}} for {{measuring}} ethanol concentration. Infrared ethanol sensors measure the vibrational frequency of dissolved ethanol using the CH band at 2900cm−1. This method uses a relatively inexpensive solid state sensor that compares the CH band with a reference band {{to calculate the}} ethanol content. The calculation makes use of the Beer-Lambert law. Alternatively, by measuring {{the density of the}} starting material and the density of the product, using a <b>hydrometer,</b> the change in specific gravity during fermentation indicates the alcohol content. This inexpensive and indirect method has a long history in the beer brewing industry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to study the {{uncertainty}} budget of <b>hydrometers</b> calibration and the error of Cuckow’s method according the Signal-to-Noise Ratio Taguchi approach in order to analyse this two different kinds of methodology. The calibration of density <b>hydrometers</b> is influenced by some parameters; in order to research the influence of these factors in the measuring value, an experimental design with dynamic characteristics was applied. With this methodology, five control factors were considered, at two levels each and a L 32 Orthogonal Array was defined. It was evaluated the influence of each parameter (factor) and the interaction between them according Cuckow’s method and Taguchi methodologies. The simultaneous analysis of the error and the sensitivity leads to a proper choice of significant control factors and respective best levels in order to reduce the variability of the measurement system...|$|R
2500|$|Sands and gravels that {{possess a}} wide range of {{particle}} sizes with a smooth distribution of particle sizes are called well graded soils. If the soil particles in a sample are predominantly in a relatively narrow range of sizes, the sample is uniformly graded. If a soil sample has distinct gaps in the gradation curve, e.g., a mixture of gravel and fine sand, with no coarse sand, the sample may be gap graded. [...] Uniformly graded and gap graded soils are both considered to be poorly graded. There are many methods for measuring particle-size distribution. The two traditional methods are sieve analysis and <b>hydrometer</b> analysis.|$|E
2500|$|Hypatia of Alexandria (c. 350–415 AD), {{daughter}} of Theon of Alexandria, was a well-known {{teacher at the}} Neoplatonic School in Alexandria teaching astronomy, philosophy, and mathematics.

Hypatia is credited with writing three major treatises on geometry, algebra and astronomy; as well as the invention of a <b>hydrometer,</b> an astrolabe, and an instrument for distilling water. There is even evidence that Hypatia gave public lectures and may have held some sort of public office in Alexandria. However, her fruitful life was cut short in 415 AD by Christian Zealots, known as Parabalani; who stripped her, dismembered her, and the pieces of her body burned.

2500|$|Since {{more than}} 90% {{of all the}} {{dissolved}} solids in grape juice are sugars, measuring the must weight is a good indicator {{of the amount of}} sugars in the wine. Rather than measure the actual [...] "weight" [...] of the must, the density or specific gravity of the juice is measured in relation to the specific gravity of distilled water. Viticulturists and winemakers can use a refractometer which uses a refractive index to indirectly measure the must weight from the juice of a single grape or they can use a <b>hydrometer</b> in the winery with the juice from several dozen or hundreds of grape berries. Different countries around the world use various scales to measure the must weight of grape juice. In the United States, New Zealand, and parts of Australia it is measured in degrees brix (symbol °Bx); in Germany (wine) it is degrees Oechsle (°Oe); in France and most of Europe the Baumé scale is used and in Austria the Klosterneuburger Mostwaage (°KMW) scale is used.|$|E
