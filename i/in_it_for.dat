5|$|After {{being drafted}} by the San Francisco Giants in 2004, Sánchez quickly {{worked his way through}} the Giants' minor league system. In 2006, he was called up to the major leagues and was used mostly in a long relief role. In 2007, he made the team out of spring {{training}} and was again used mostly in long relief, though he spent part of his season in the minors. In 2008, he made the Giants' starting rotation and remained <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the entire year, except for a stint on the disabled list.|$|E
5|$|Horny. I'm feeling really horny about it. And very smug … I'm in that mode now, so {{hopefully}} I'll stay <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a while … I've got a {{few more}} things planned—at least a couple more albums, some EPs, things like that. Some more dance-y things I did about 10 years ago. Experimental things, noise things, weird things. Shitloads of stuff. They're all pretty much ready to go.|$|E
5|$|In the Main Story Epilogue, Lady {{returns to}} the Devil May Cry Office to settle up. Claiming that Dante and Trish only {{escalated}} the situation by unwittingly providing the Devil Arms that were key to Sanctus’ plan, she gladly pays them next to nothing. But as Trish answers a call for a new job, Dante gets Lady back for it by allowing her to tag along without getting paid. It’s clear {{that none of them}} are <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the money anyway, as all three charge into the night guns blazing.|$|E
30|$|As {{it can be}} {{seen from}} the above table, for the {{relationship}} between psychological capital and innovation <b>in</b> <b>IT,</b> r[*]=[*] 0.455. <b>For</b> the relationship between self-efficacy and innovation <b>in</b> <b>IT,</b> r[*]=[*] 0.363. <b>For</b> the relationship between hope and innovation <b>in</b> <b>IT,</b> r[*]=[*] 0.414. <b>For</b> the relationship between optimism and innovation <b>in</b> <b>IT,</b> r[*]=[*] 0.386. <b>For</b> the relationship between resilience and innovation <b>in</b> <b>IT,</b> r[*]=[*] 0.432. Therefore, all of the relations are significant at the Alpha level of 0.05. All the relationships are positive, implying that as psychological capital and its dimensions increase, innovation level <b>in</b> <b>IT</b> would increase too.|$|R

5|$|Morgan {{was driving}} from Leeds to Southampton Docks {{when he picked}} up Figard on 19 December 1995. Detectives {{concluded}} that after raping and killing her, Morgan left her body in the bottom bunk of his cab for up to ten days while he continued to drive the lorry, driving and sleeping <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> {{at least some of}} that time, before disposing of the body on 29 December. He was arrested in February 1996 after another lorry driver recognised him from a photofit. Morgan initially denied meeting her, but after he was picked out at an identity parade, he claimed he and Figard had met and engaged in consensual sex.|$|E
5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} the FDA interviewed physicians, Reich's {{students}} and his patients, asking about the orgone accumulators. A professor at the University of Oregon who bought an accumulator told an FDA inspector that he knew the device was phoney, but found it helpful because his wife sat quietly <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> four hours every day.|$|E
50|$|The {{play was}} adapted into an opera at least twice. J. V. Bridgeman adapted <b>it</b> <b>in</b> English <b>for</b> Balfe's The Armourer of Nantes (1863). Emilio Praga adapted <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Italian <b>for</b> Maria Tudor (1879) {{composed}} by Antônio Carlos Gomes.|$|R

5|$|Some non-aqueous {{solvents}} can {{behave as}} acids. An acidic solvent will increase basicity of substances dissolved <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> example, the compound CH3COOH {{is known as}} acetic acid because of its acidic behaviour in water. However it behaves as a base in liquid hydrogen chloride, a much more acidic solvent.|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} {{blend of}} numerous schools shows clearly {{because of the}} different cultural groups involved in the mosque's construction, including the architecture of Europe, the Middle East, China, and the Minangkabau. The mosque's roof goes upwards in five steps, with the dome at the top; {{the first step is}} square, while the rest are octagonal. Each part of the roof has slits <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> lighting.|$|E
5|$|Zappa uniquely {{contributed to}} the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, {{sampling}} radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also {{contributed to the}} radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The cover art was provided by Cal Schenkel whom Zappa met in New York. This initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous Zappa and Mothers albums.|$|E

5|$|The {{house was}} built in 1878 for Theodore Waters Foster, born on May 19, 1847, to Chauncey Foster and Ophelia Remington. He was educated in Pawtucket and joined the Rhode Island Cavalry in 1863. He served in the American Civil War under Nathaniel P. Banks in the Red River Campaign. In 1873, he formed a jewelry-manufacturing {{partnership}} with Walter E. White and Samuel H. Baily, named White, Foster & Company. After White retired in 1878, the company was renamed Foster & Bailey. During this time, Foster constructed the house and lived <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a period of four years, commuting to his place of business in Providence, Rhode Island. Foster {{would continue to be}} successful in his jewelry manufacturing business and his son, Theodore Clyde Foster, would succeed him upon his death in 1928. In 1882, Theodore Foster sold the home to George W. Payne, the owner of the G. W. Payne & Company.|$|E
5|$|While {{he still}} felt a disdain for public life, Tchaikovsky now participated <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> two reasons—his {{increasing}} celebrity, {{and what he}} felt was his duty to promote Russian music. To this end, he helped support his former pupil Sergei Taneyev, {{now director of the}} Moscow Conservatory, by attending student examinations and negotiating the sometimes sensitive relations among various members of the staff. Tchaikovsky also served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889–90 season. In this post, he invited a number of international celebrities to conduct, including Johannes Brahms, Antonín Dvořák and Jules Massenet. Tchaikovsky promoted Russian music both in his own compositions and in his role as a guest conductor. In January 1887 he substituted at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow on short notice for the first three performances of his opera Cherevichki. Conducting was something the composer had wanted to master for at least a decade, as he saw that success outside Russia depended to some extent on conducting his own works. Within a year of the Cherevichki performances, Tchaikovsky was in considerable demand throughout Europe and Russia, which helped him overcome a life-long stage fright and boosted his self-assurance.|$|E
25|$|Later it was re-edited by Zappa {{as part of}} {{a project}} called No Commercial Potential, which {{included}} three other albums: We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> the Money, Cruising with Ruben & the Jets and Uncle Meat.|$|E
