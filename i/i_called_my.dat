Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: [...] "I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years. And <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>my</b> father, cause I realized I hadn’t spoken to him in 3 weeks and I told him how much I love him and how much I appreciated what a good father he's been." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Ralph Bakshi {{decided that}} it was time to make another {{animated}} film. According to Bakshi, [...] "I made 1,500 bucks in 10 years of painting; I thought it would be nice to pick up a piece of change. So <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>my</b> lawyer, who was still speaking to me because no one ever leaves Hollywood, and asked him where I should go to sell a movie." [...] Bakshi pitched Cool World to Paramount Pictures (where Bakshi had worked as the final head of the studio's animation division) as an animated horror film. The concept of the film involved a cartoon and live action human having sex and conceiving a hybrid child who visits the real world to murder the father who abandoned her. Bakshi states that Paramount Pictures [...] "bought the idea in ten seconds".|$|E

Clemenson was apprehensive about pursuing one of the lead roles in a television show because of the long time commitments involved. He later said, [...] "The similarities between this show and The Wild Wild West, and my character to that show's Artemus Gordon, was an important hook for me. It {{was one of my}} favorite shows growing up, and as soon as I saw that Brisco County was based on the same kind of material and attitude as that show, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>my</b> agent and said, 'I'll do anything I {{have to do to get}} this. Clemenson applied his experiences at Ivy League schools to play the uptight Poole. Praising Clemenson's work on Brisco, Cuse said, [...] "You can't give him anything he's not capable of doing.

500|$|In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson, who had briefly portrayed Nick Fury {{at the end}} of {{the film}} Iron Man, signed on to reprise the role in Thor as part of an {{unprecedented}} nine-picture deal with Marvel Studios. However, in an April 2010 interview, Jackson stated that he would not be appearing in Thor. When asked why not Jackson explained, [...] "I have no idea. I'm not in charge of making those kinds of decisions. I thought I was; they said I was in the trades, and I was like, 'Ooh! I got a job!' <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>my</b> agent he said, 'Naw, you're not in it.' I was like, 'Well shit, they need to pay me if they're gonna put my name in it. Later in the month, Jackson revealed that he would be filming a scene for Thor to serve as [...] "connective tissue" [...] for The Avengers. Also in February, a casting call went out looking for actors with certain physical attributes to audition for the role of Thor.|$|E
500|$|Matthew's account {{suggests}} that the Magi knew from the star that the [...] "king of the Jews" [...] had been born even before they arrived in Jerusalem. They present Jesus with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, and as verse 11 describes: [...] "they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him". In a dream, they are warned not to return to Jerusalem, so they leave for their own country by another route. When Herod realizes he has been tricked, he orders the execution of all male children in Bethlehem [...] "two years old and younger," [...] based on the age the child could be {{in regard to the}} information the magi had given him concerning the time the star first appeared. Joseph, warned in a dream, takes his family to Egypt for their safety. The Gospel links the escape to a verse from scripture, which it interprets as a prophecy: [...] "Out of Egypt <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>my</b> son." [...] This was a reference to the departure of the Hebrews from Egypt under Moses, so the quote {{suggests that}} Matthew saw the life of Jesus as recapitulating the story of the Jewish people, with Judea representing Egypt and Herod standing in for pharaoh. After Herod dies, Joseph and his family return from Egypt, and settle in Nazareth in Galilee. This is also said to be a fulfillment of a prophecy ("He will be called a Nazorean," [...] (NRSV) which could be attributed to Judges 13:5 regarding the birth of Samson and the Narazite vow. The word [...] "Nazareth" [...] is related to the word [...] "netzer" [...] which means [...] "sprout", and which some Bible commentators think refers to Isaiah 11:1, [...] "And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch out of his roots shall bear fruit."

2500|$|When [...] had gone, {{an angel}} of the Lord {{appeared}} to Joseph in a dream. Get up, he said, take {{the child and}} his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going {{to search for the}} child to kill him. So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: [...] "Out of Egypt <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>my</b> son." [...] When Herod realised that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old or under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi. Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: [...] "A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Original beats {{that feature}} funk-styled bass or rhythm guitar riffs are also not uncommon. Dr. Dre (considered the {{progenitor}} of the G-funk genre) has freely acknowledged to being {{heavily influenced by}} George Clinton's psychedelic funk: [...] "Back in the 70s that's all people were doing: getting high, wearing Afros, bell-bottoms and listening to Parliament-Funkadelic. That's why <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>my</b> album The Chronic and based my music and the concepts like I did: because his shit was a big influence on my music. Very big". Digital Underground was a large contributor to the rebirth of funk in the 1990s by educating their listeners with knowledge {{about the history of}} funk and its artists. George Clinton branded Digital Underground as [...] "Sons of the P", as their second full-length release is also titled. DU's first release, Sex Packets, was full of funk samples, with the most widely known [...] "The Humpty Dance" [...] sampling Parliament's [...] "Let's Play House". A very strong funk album of DU's was their 1996 release Future Rhythm. Much of contemporary club dance music, drum and bass in particular has heavily sampled funk drum breaks.|$|E
2500|$|Small in stature, {{he lacked}} the overall power of his larger {{competitors}} such as Don Budge and Kramer but made up for it with brains, ball control, and speed. A master court strategist and tactician, he worked his opponent out of position and scored points with the game's best drop shot and lob as well as punishing ground strokes that let him come to the net for put-away shots. [...] Kramer, {{one of the very}} few players who was undeniably better than Riggs, writes that there is a major [...] "misconception" [...] about Riggs. [...] "He didn't play some rinky-dink Harold Solomon style, pitty-pattying the ball around on dirt. [...] He didn't have the big serve, but he made up for it with some sneaky first serves and as fine a second serve as I had seen at that time. [...] When you talk about depth and accuracy both, Riggs' second serve ranks with the other three best that I ever saw: von Cramm's, Gonzales's, and Newcombe's." [...] In his own autobiography, Riggs wrote, [...] "In the 1946 match with Budge , I charged the net at every opportunity.
