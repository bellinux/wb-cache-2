40|$|Abstract [...] The {{catches of}} bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) were {{compared}} between attractive traps releasing semiochemicals and passive traps (cylindrical sticky screens hung, at 10 heights of 0. 7 - 11. 5 m, on poles). A central attractive-trap pole {{was surrounded by}} three passive-trap poles spaced 50 or 100 m away at the apices of an equilateral triangle. The catches of Tomicus piniperda and other scolytid species on the attractive-trap pole baited with host monoterpenes, or the catches of Ips typographus attracted to synthetic pheromone, were compared to passive trap catches in a Scots pine forest or in a Norway spruce clear-cut, respectively. Information about flight height distributions of the above scolytid species, and Hylurgops palliatus, Cryphalus abietis, Pityogenes chalcographus, P. quadridens, P. bidentatus, and Trypodendron domesticum were obtained on the passive and attractive trap poles. A new method is presented for determining the densities of flying insects based on the passive trap's dimensions and catch, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>test,</b> and speed of insect. Also, a novel concept, the effective attraction radius (EAR), is presented for comparing attractants of species, which is independent of insect density, locality, or <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>test.</b> The EAR is obtained by the ratio of attractive and passive trap catches and {{the dimensions of the}} passive trap, and thus should correlate positively with the strength of the attractant and the distance of attraction. EARs are determined from catch data of T. piniperda and L typographus {{as well as from the}} data of previous investigations on the same or other bark beetles...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} study for assessing the degradation of the fatigue properties of reinforcing steel bars grade S 400 caused by exposure to laboratory salt spray corrosion environment are presented. For this purpose, low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests were carried out. Furthermore, the effect of ribs on the fatigue strength was recorded. Results are indicative of the catalytic impact of corrosion on LCF behavior. Since two important degradation factors such as corrosion and LCF are functions of time, {{it appears that the}} reliability of steel S 400 is also time dependant. Additionally, the presence of ribs on material's surface affects significantly the fatigue behavior by reducing energy dissipation and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>test...</b>|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} forwarding {{performance of}} IPsec gateway over {{the rage of}} offered loads. It focuses on the forwarding rate and packet loss particularly at the gateway’s performance peak and {{at the state of}} gateway’s overload. It explains possible performance degradation when the gateway is overloaded by excessive offered load. The paper further evaluates different approaches for obtaining forwarding performance parameters – a widely used throughput described in RFC 1242, maximum forwarding rate with zero packet loss and us proposed equilibrium throughput. According to our observations equilibrium throughput might be the most universal parameter for benchmarking security gateways as the others may be dependent on the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> trials. Employing equilibrium throughput would also greatly shorten the time required for benchmarking. Lastly, the paper presents methodology and a hybrid step/binary search algorithm for obtaining value of equilibrium throughput...|$|E

40|$|Goal of this {{research}} was to find out if reorientation can influence cladding failure and determine conditions and possible mechanism of failure.  Reorientation tests were done on zircaloy nuclear fuel cladding specimens. Specimens were made having two triangular notches along specimen axis which are similar to the surface flaw that can form during operation. Loading was applied using PLT loading fixture to give stress proportional to a distance from the specimen front. When loaded, specimen was cooled from 340 to 40 °C at a cooling rate 0. 25 °/min., total <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> was 20 h.   After testing, specimen was examined layer by layer metallographically to determine hydride reorientation under certain stress conditions. In case of a surface flaw reorientation of hydrides takes place perpendicular to the stress direction.

ANOVA results reveal that normal load and time (test duration) have the most significant effect in controlling wear and friction of the coating. Interaction between normal load and wear track diameter has some significant effect. Scanning electron microscopy of worn surface shows abrasive wear to be predominant. The surface morphology, composition, and phase structure analysis are done with the help of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Fly ash-based geopolymer {{concrete}} is manufactured using fly ash as {{its source}} material {{and does not}} use Portland cement at all. Beside fly ash, alkaline solution is also utilized to make geopolymer paste which binds the aggregates to form geopolymer concrete. This paper presents the study of creep behaviour of fly ash-based geopolymer concrete. Four series of specimens with various compressive strengths were prepared to study its creep behaviour for the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> up to one year. The test method followed the procedures applied for Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concrete. Test results show that fly ash-based geopolymer concrete undergoes low creep which is generally {{less than that of}} OPC concrete. After one year of loading, the results for specific creep of fly ash-based geopolymer concrete in this study ranges from 15 to 29 microstrain for concrete compressive strength 67 – 40 MPa respectively. From the test results, it is also found out that the creep coefficient of fly ash-based geopolymer concrete is about half of that predicted using Gilbert’s Method for OPC concrete...|$|E

40|$|Invasive {{aspergillosis}} (IA) is {{a frequent}} complication of blood or marrow transplantation. Previous studies have reported that the Aspergillus galactomannan enzyme immunoassay (GM EIA) may be a useful diagnostic tool for IA, but its sensitivity is variable. We examined {{the performance of the}} GM EIA in 986 serum samples from 67 patients. Results demonstrated that decreasing the index cutoff for positivity to 0. 5 increased its sensitivity, with minimal loss of specificity. The low cutoff increased the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> positivity before diagnosis by clinical means. Sensitivity was highest in patients who did not receive preventative mold-active antifungals (87. 5 %). A rabbit model demonstrated that the level of circulating antigen correlated with the tissue fungus burden. A quantifiable response to antifungal therapy in clinical samples and the rabbit model supports the development of this assay for early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. The 0. 5 cutoff may allow for better performance as an early diagnostic test.

40|$|The current {{reliance}} {{on the use of}} the Mouse Bioassay to detect shellfish biotoxins in national shellfish safety programmes in Europe means that there are regulatory aspects that potentially conflict between food hygiene and animal experimentation legislation. In the United Kingdom, the use of animals for any scientific purpose requires authorisation under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Such use must consider fully all aspects of the 3 "R"s, including the use of reasonably practicable alternatives as they become available, minimising animal numbers on protocols and ensuring methodology minimises potential suffering. Laboratories within the UK have investigated a number of approaches to address the 3 "R"s in the shellfish biotoxin monitoring programme. These include pre-screening methods, reduction of <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> and the number of animals used for each sample and the use of anaesthesia.

40|$|Background: Noise {{is defined}} as {{unwanted}} or meaningless sound that apart from auditory adverse health effects may distract attention from cues that are important for task performance. Human performance is influenced by many job-related factors and workplace conditions including noise level. Objective: To study the effect of noise on human performance. Methods: The participants included 40 healthy male university students. The experimental design consisted of 3 (sound pressure level) x 3 (noise schedule) x 2 (noise type) factors. To investigate occupational skill performance, some specific test batteries were used: 1) steadiness test, 2) Minnesota manual dexterity test, 3) hand tool dexterity test, and 4) two-arm coordination test. Time <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> completion was measured as speed response; to determine error response, the time taken during committing an error by participants while performing a task was measured. Results: Speed response obtained from the 4 tests in combined conditions of noise schedule, harmonic index, and sound pressure level was highest for (intermittent, treble, 95 dB), (continuous, treble, 95 dB), (continuous, treble, 85 dB) and (intermittent, treble, 95 dB), respectively. Conclusion: Treble noise was found significant in reducing human performance; also, intermittent noise, especially at high pressure levels, was responsible for worsening environmental conditions during performing a task. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} for designing inputs to identify stability and control derivatives from flight test data is presented. This approach {{is based on}} finding inputs which provide the maximum possible accuracy of derivative estimates. Two techniques of input specification are implemented for this objective - a time domain technique and a frequency domain technique. The time domain technique gives the control input time history {{and can be used}} for any allowable <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> maneuver, including those where data lengths can only be of short duration. The frequency domain technique specifies the input frequency spectrum, and is best applied for tests where extended data lengths, much longer than the time constants of the modes of interest, are possible. These technqiues are used to design inputs to identify parameters in longitudinal and lateral linear models of conventional aircraft. The constraints of aircraft response limits, such as on structural loads, are realized indirectly through a total energy constraint on the input. Tests with simulated data and theoretical predictions show that the new approaches give input signals which can provide more accurate parameter estimates than can conventional inputs of the same total energy. Results obtained indicate that the approach has been brought {{to the point where it}} should be used on flight tests for further evaluation...|$|E
30|$|To {{study the}} effects of cyclic equiaxial strain on cardiomyogenic {{differentiation}} of rAMSCs, the expression of cardiomyogenic markers and morphological features of cells among test and control groups were examined. Cells with no chemical or mechanical treatments were cultured as the control group with the same culture <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> samples. Test groups included two groups of cells subjected to cyclic equiaxial strain with two amplitudes of 5 % or 10 %, cells treated by chemical factor (5 azacytidine), and finally samples subjected to 10 % cyclic equiaxial stretch accompanied by chemical factor (5 azacytidine). Regardless of the type of stimulation, all test samples were treated for 24  h as previously reported for continuous mechanical treatment of cells (Huang et al. 2012). It has been suggested that that longer durations might damage cells, while shorter times might not induce sufficient target differentiation. Samples of test groups were treated for 24  h and expression of cardiac-related markers was studied after 1  week of further culture of treated cells (Huang et al. 2012). The 1  week interval was to evaluate long-term upregulation of genes, since in some occasions, after initial upregulation, gene silence occurs a few days after cell conditioning (Huang et al. 2010). Additionally, cell images were captured before and after treatments and morphological analysis was performed through image processing.|$|E
