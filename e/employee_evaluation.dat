Transfeminists, for instance, propose client advisory boards for crisis lines and women's shelters, the end of unpaid and underpaid feminist internships, incorporating employees into board committees that evaluate non-profit executives, creating strategic funds to assist trans employees with nontraditional health issues, incorporating specific anti-racist and other anti-oppressive criteria on <b>employee</b> <b>evaluation</b> forms, and more. Particularly fruitful has been transfeminist investigation of feminism and disability, feminism and sex, and the combination of the three.|$|E

When writing messages about stocks or financial services, it is important to follow the laws that protect investors. Also, regarding safety information, it is essential to write warnings on dangerous products as clearly and succinctly as possible. Messages that are used in sales and marketing should not have any false or misleading information. The messages should not be written in a way that will deceive customers. The use of proper language is also helpful regarding <b>employee</b> <b>evaluation.</b> In letters of recommendation, it is best to use positive language and stick to information that is related to the job.|$|E
50|$|In a {{laboratory}} {{study conducted by}} Correll, Bernard, and Paik (2007), participants were given the resumes of a parent and non-parent with equivalent qualifications and asked to complete an <b>employee</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Results indicated that mothers were rated as significantly less competent, less committed, less promotable {{and less likely to}} be recommended for management than non-mothers. Furthermore, the suggested starting salaries for mothers were $11,000 (7.6%) less than for non-mothers, and only 48% of mothers were recommended for hire, compared to 87% of non-mothers. In addition, the standards for mothers were much stricter; they were given significantly less time for being late, and needed a significantly higher score on the management exam in order to even be considered for hire compared to non-mothers.|$|E
5000|$|According to the School Leadership Today article, [...] "Freedom in Teacher Performance Pay", {{teachers}} in America {{are one of}} the most underpaid and segregated fields. The editorial suggests that [...] "It is vital that teachers can be paid more without having to leave the classroom. This will be particularly important to schools in the most disadvantaged areas as it will empower them to attract and recruit the best teachers." [...] Oftentimes teachers that want to be paid more are pushed into primary and secondary administration, opposed to being chairs of departments like advanced educational opportunities like colleges. This causes teachers to be in rotation and can lead to many shortages of quality teachers actually in the classroom. The academic journal suggests that we should rely on a different pay band policy to keep {{teachers in}} the classroom to ensure quality of education while paying via performance of the teachers as well. It is important to note, that paying for performance does not entail: how many students pas the standardized tests, move to the next grade; but rather a secondary tool of <b>employee</b> <b>evaluation.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the concept ‘Employee Evaluation’ (Danish: MUS) is articulated in KUC {{which is a}} department of Kriminalforsorgen. Furthermore this paper discusses if <b>Employee</b> <b>Evaluation</b> increases professional and social skills of the employee. We have carried out interviews with two employees and their leader. In order to analyze our interviews we have accounted for Discourse Analysis and <b>Employee</b> <b>Evaluation</b> Theory. Furthermore we have accounted {{for the development of}} the concept of work to get an understanding of the demands of the employee in the modern work life today. Based upon our interviews we have found four main discourses: <b>Employee</b> <b>Evaluation</b> as relevant tool, <b>Employee</b> <b>Evaluation</b> as continuously dialogue, <b>Employee</b> <b>Evaluation</b> as the responsibility of the employee or leader and <b>Employee</b> <b>Evaluation</b> as duty. It can be concluded that the material made of Kriminalforsorgen on <b>Employee</b> <b>Evaluation</b> was not followed at KUC. Moreover there was doubt about who had the main responsibility for the conversation and the content: The leader or the employee? Furthermore it can be concluded that the minimum requirements for the personnel were not followed in the department and therefore the relevance disappeared even more. Finally it can be concluded that <b>Employee</b> <b>Evaluation</b> does not increase professional or social skills of the employees at KUC because of different understandings of professional and social skills and which purpose the concept of <b>Employee</b> <b>Evaluation</b> should fulfil...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to analyse}} {{the system of}} <b>employee</b> <b>evaluation</b> at a specific company by {{comparing}} theoretical knowledge and its practical application and, after evaluating the findings, to propose an optimisation of the current system if necessary.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} two complementary {{models of}} firm-specific training: an informational model and a productivity-enhancement model. In both models, market provision of firm-specific training is inefficient. However, {{the nature of}} the inefficiency depends on the balance between the two key components of training, namely productivity enhancement and <b>employee</b> <b>evaluation.</b> In the informal model, training results in a proportionate increase in productivity enhancement and <b>employee</b> <b>evaluation,</b> and training is underprovided by the market. In the productivity-enhancement model, training results in an increase in productivity enhancement but no change in <b>employee</b> <b>evaluation,</b> and training is overprovided by the market. In both models, turnover is inefficiently low. Firm-specific training, productivity enhancement, <b>employee</b> <b>evaluation,</b> firm-specific human capital. ...|$|E
50|$|From {{a talent}} {{management}} standpoint, <b>employee</b> <b>evaluations</b> concern two major areas of measurement: performance and potential.

However, talent management also seeks to focus on an employee’s potential, meaning an employee’s future performance, if given the proper development of skills and increased responsibility.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to motivating the rewarded behavior, standards-based methods {{can provide a}} level of standardization in <b>employee</b> <b>evaluations,</b> which can reduce fears of favoritism and make the employer's expectations clear.
