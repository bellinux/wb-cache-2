40|$|The {{appearance}} of a building is personal and depends on, for example, previous experiences, knowledge and background. The {{appearance of}} a farm is therefore {{depending on whether the}} observer has the knowledge of modem farming or not. The "Svensson" is a person without the knowledge of modern farming. He expects farms to look like they did until the l 950 's. This opinion has developed partly due to stories told by elder people, old Swedish movies and literature. The "Bonde" is a person with knowledge of modern farming. <b>He</b> <b>will</b> <b>include</b> how things <b>will</b> work out on the farm in his aesthetic judgement of it. To find out which things are important to make a farm look harmonious and pleasant, interviews were made on Focksta, a farm outside of Uppsala, Sweden. Six people including representatives from both "Svensson" and "Bonde" were interviewed. According to the interviews the first impressions of a farm are important. The maintenance is also important. The first views and the front sides of the farm should therefore be made with care and consideration. Many things are important to make a farm look pleasant and attractive. One {{of the most important things}} for making a farm look pleasant is that it looks uniform. All of the farm buildings should be about the same size. If one building is a lot bigger than the others, the uniformity and concordance of the farm is disturbed. The building material and colour, of the buildings are also important. If all buildings are the same colour they will look alike even if the size or height differ some. If details and ornaments are the same on different buildings, that should be emphasised to make the concordance stronger. People seem to accept two main building materials on a farm. On Focksta, wood and steel facades are most common, one small building is built in brick. The brick building looks misplaced and disturbs the harmony mostly because of its material, according to the interviewed people. The "Svensson" is curious about the modern farm and its functions. <b>He</b> <b>will</b> accept most appearances when he‘s told about the functions, which have placed certain demands on the outdoor appearance. The persons who are "experts" (have studied aesthetics) will tell why a building is beautiful or ugly whereas most other people only can tell that it is beautiful or ugly. Experts are able to look at one building or detail at time where other people tend to compare it with details and buildings close to and viewed earlier...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a survey which {{describes}} and explains in non-technical terms the logic behind various methodologies used in conducting retrospective quantitative evaluations {{of public policy}} programs. The programs usually have as their main targets firms or individuals who benefit from direct subsidies and/or training. It is hypothesised {{that because of the}} technical nature of quantitative evaluations, some of the public officials to whom these evaluations are intended, may find them too complex to comprehend fully. Hence, those officials might disregard them up front, or form a biased opinion (positive or negative) or even accept the results on their face value. However, because all evaluations are subjective by definition, the public officials should have some basic knowledge on the logic behind the design and context of evaluations. Only then, can they judge themselves on their worth, and consequently decide to what degree they will take into account their findings and recommendations. The paper initially discusses the issues of accountability and causality and then introduces policy evaluation as a two phase process: First, estimations are made on the potential impact of the policy in question and then a judgement is passed on the worth of the impacts estimated, through a cost benefit analysis. The estimations in turn, comprise of two related areas: the design of the evaluation and the model specification. In designs, one has to consider whether counterfactual populations are included or not and whether the impact variables are in cross-sectional or longitudinal format. In model specifications the evaluator must decide which independent control variables <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>include</b> in the regression model so as to account for selection bias. In cost benefit analysis decisions have to be made as to whether the analysis will be made at partial equilibrium or general equilibrium level and whether the judgements formulated will be based purely on efficiency grounds or using just distributional criteria as well. The paper recommends among others, that (a) public policy evaluations should establish clear rules of causation between the public intervention and the potential impact measured, (b) limitations in the estimation and cost benefit analysis phase must be explicitly stated and (c) retrospective evaluations should be conducted at closer intervals {{after the end of the}} intervention so as to reduce the external heterogeneity generated due to the time lag between the results produced and the on-going programs.
