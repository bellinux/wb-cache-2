25|$|Dashwood {{found out}} that there were three privateers at Mariel, a little west of Havana, and {{decided to try to}} capture them. The first step was to send in Bacchantes boats to take a round tower that was {{protecting}} the harbour. The tower stood 40' high, had three 24-pounders on its top, loopholes for muskets around its circumference, and had a garrison of a captain and 30 men. The attack commenced in the evening of 5 April, with the British capturing the fort despite heavy fire. The 13 British seamen and marines suffered one man wounded before they landed; the Spanish had two killed and three wounded. Leaving a sergeant and six marines to guard the prisoners, the boats then headed into the harbour. There they discovered that the privateers had left the day before. Still, despite heavy small-arms fire, the British succeeded <b>in</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>out</b> two schooners carrying sugar.|$|E

500|$|At surface, [...] "The Painted Skin" [...] is a {{story of}} a lustful scholar's {{encounter}} with a demon who disguises itself as a lady. Pu Songling intended for the story to be viewed as a parable of human desire and its negative consequences, and emphasised this with his appended comment, [...] "a typical piece of moral didacticism that denounces sexual promiscuity, extols faithfulness, and endorses belief in karma and retribution." [...] "The Painted Skin" [...] utilises both the zhiguai and chuanqi styles of writing <b>in</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>out</b> [...] "the ghost's critical and creative writing", whereas the complexity of prose parallels the [...] "cultural ramifications of the ghost." ...|$|E
500|$|Kapoor next took on {{the role}} of a drug abusing rock star in Udta Punjab (2016), a crime drama from the {{director}} Abhishek Chaubey that documents the substance abuse endemic in the Indian state of Punjab. Kapoor, a teetotaler, found it challenging to play a character who he deemed to be [...] "all about addiction". He based the role on several pop stars, and was particularly interested <b>in</b> <b>bringing</b> <b>out</b> the character's hidden vulnerability despite his obnoxious actions. Udta Punjab generated controversy when the Central Board of Film Certification demanded extensive censorship before its theatrical release, citing that the portrayal of Punjab in it was negative. The demands sparked a broad debate about the freedom of expression in India. After the producers of the film filed lawsuit against the board, the Bombay High Court cleared the film for exhibition with a single scene cut, in which Kapoor's character is shown urinating on people. In a highly positive review, Sukanya Verma took note of the film's anti-drug message; in addition, she considered Kapoor to be [...] "spectacularly unbridled" [...] in his part and added that [...] "the believability he brings to his complex transition while preserving his inherent flakiness deserves all the praise". Kapoor won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor (shared with Manoj Bajpayee for Aligarh) and received a Best Actor nomination at the same ceremony.|$|E

A modern poet, however, may perhaps be pardoned for an error of which Milton himself is thought not to have kept clear, and for which there seems so natural a cause in the difference between poetical and amiable characters." ...|$|E
