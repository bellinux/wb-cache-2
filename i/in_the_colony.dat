5|$|Carroll {{travelled}} to England {{to press}} his case, although Hart later {{claimed that he}} had been promised no such lobbying would take place. Carroll convinced the proprietor's officials to appoint him as the proprietor's chief agent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b> He was further appointed to the positions of receiver general, escheator, and naval officer. These positions together effectively gave Carroll the power to oversee all money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> that was collected by the government or by Calvert's private organization.|$|E

50|$|Cash <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> was {{denominated}} <b>in</b> pounds, shillings, and pence.

The prevalence of <b>the</b> Spanish dollar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> led to <b>the</b> money of the United States being denominated in dollars rather than pounds.|$|R

5|$|Henry Darnall died in 1711. Carroll {{took over}} Darnall's {{positions}} as agent and receiver general for the Calvert family <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony,</b> both posts with significant additional salaries. Among the many uses {{to which he}} put this money was lending. After 1713, he became the largest mortgage lender <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony,</b> and {{made a number of}} large personal loans to other planters. Carroll continued to practice law, making a small income from cases argued in the two courts where Catholics were still allowed to practice law, the chancery and prerogative courts. His speculation in mercantile enterprises also continued. Together, these made Carroll the wealthiest man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> by 1715, and its most prominent Catholic.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of honey bee worker diversity within <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> on: development, honey productivity, and wintering. Two different levels of diversity within <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> were tested. <b>The</b> appropriate levels of diversity within <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> were obtained by selecting drones for inseminating the queens. Lower genetic diversity was obtained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> headed by a queen inseminated with semen collected from drones originating from a single colony. Higher genetic diversity was obtained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> with queens inseminated with semen from drones of 30 different colonies. Colonies with a higher genetic variation of workers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> had greater levels of functional characteristics. However, apart from the number of dead bees <b>in</b> winter, <b>the</b> genetic diversity level of the workers on <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> development and honey production, did not have a significant influence. There was an averaging effect observed concerning that male component <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> with a higher genetic variation of workers - on honey yield, when compared to the non-additive effect of the best drones...|$|R
5|$|The demands made by {{the colonial}} {{government}} on Congolese workers during the war provoked strikes and riots from the workforce. Whites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> were allowed to form trade unions {{for the first time}} during the war, and their demands for better pay and working conditions were often emulated by black workers. In October 1941, white workers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> unsuccessfully attempted a general strike across the colony.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} situation improved {{with the arrival}} of cattle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b> It is unknown when the first cattle arrived, but the division of land for the grazing of cattle in 1627 represented one of the first moves towards private land ownership <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b> Cattle became an important source of wealth in the colony; the average cow could sell for £28 in 1638 (£ in 2010, or $ at PPP). However, the flood of immigrants during the Great Migration drove the price of cattle down. The same cows sold at £28 in 1638 were valued in 1640 at only £5 (£ in 2010, or $ at PPP). Besides cattle, there were also pigs, sheep, and goats raised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the French Revolution in 1789 there were eight times as many slaves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> as there were white and mixed-race people put together.

5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, Maryland's economy was {{suffering}} {{from the effects of}} price fluctuations on the world market of its main cash crop, tobacco. Often in those years, the price on world markets was barely above the cost of production, leaving planters with little to show for their efforts. This affected small Protestant planters disproportionately, as many of the larger Catholic landowners had diversified economically. This growing socioeconomic inequality exacerbated underlying religious tensions. Furthermore, the new Governor, William Joseph, who arrived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> just before Carroll, immediately entered into an adversarial relationship with the Protestant-dominated lower house of the assembly. Into this powder keg came the news that England's Glorious Revolution had taken place; the Catholic King James II had been deposed and replaced with the Protestant William of Orange. In an attempt to maintain control <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony,</b> Governor Joseph quickly canceled the session of the colonial assembly scheduled for April 1689.|$|E
5|$|Carroll {{supported}} Charles Calvert, the colony's Catholic proprietor, in {{an unsuccessful}} {{effort to prevent}} the Protestant majority from gaining political control over Maryland. Following {{the overthrow of the}} Calvert proprietorship and the subsequent exclusion of Catholics from colonial government, Carroll turned his attention to planting, law, business, and various offices in the proprietor's remnant organization. He was the wealthiest man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> by the time of his death. In the last years of his life, Carroll attempted to regain some vestige of political power for Catholics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony,</b> but the Protestant colonial assembly and Governor John Hart disfranchised them. His son, Charles Carroll of Annapolis, became a wealthy planter and his grandson, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, also wealthy, was the only Catholic signer of the United States Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Carroll's {{descendants}} {{continued to}} play a prominent role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b> His son Charles, known as Charles Carroll of Annapolis, maintained and expanded the family fortune. His grandson, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, achieved the restoration of political rights his grandfather had desired. He became the only Catholic to sign the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
