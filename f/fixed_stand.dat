40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the relationship between the}} muscle activity of the neck and the reaction time of eye movement (RTEM) during neck flexion. This study consisted of two experiments: (1) the relationship between RTEM and the angle of necl flexion with the condition that the chin was placed or was not placed on a <b>fixed</b> <b>stand,</b> and (2) the relationship between RTEM and muscle activity of the neck extensor muscles under hanging weight so as to increase the moment around the joints of neck. Seven male subjects, aged 23 to 28 years, sat on a chair and the trunk was stabilized. The angle of neck flexion, which is defined as the angle between perpendicular line and tragusacromion line, was established using an angular detector with the baseline angle (0 °) being the angle between both lines at rest. The subjects were instructed to pursue a light target which moved horizontally and tectangularly with an amplitude of 10 ° for a random duration of 1 - 3 seconds; (1) while maintaining the angle of neck flexion at 10 ° and 20 ° under the condition that the chin was placed or was not placed on a <b>fixed</b> <b>stand,</b> and (2) while maintaining the neck at 20 ° with hanging the weights ranging from ten per cent to 50 % of the maximal strength of the neck extensor muscles. Analysis items were RTEM and the relative muscle activity (RMA) of the upper trapezius muscle. The results were as follows: 1) When the chin was not placed on the placed on the <b>fixed</b> <b>stand,</b> RTEM shortened and RAM increased as the angle of neck flexion increased. However, when the chin was placed on the <b>fixed</b> <b>stand,</b> RTEM and RMA did not change at any angle. These results suggest that RTEM is shortened not by the changes in the engle of neck flexion but by the physiological factors accompanying the increase of muscular action of the neck extensor muscles. 2) The relationship between mean RTEM and mean RMA showed that RTEM was similarly reduced between approximately 5 % and 20 % compared with that in the quiet posture, but was prolonged by approximately 30 % RMA causing the smallest RTEM ranged from 2. 5 % to 22. 4 % in each subject. These results suggest that RTEM is reduced when the muscular action of the neck extensor muscles increased somewhat, that subject-to-subject variance is relatively large, and that the mechanism which prevents the reduction of RTEM operates when muscle activity is above the optimal RMA...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a real time hybrid 2 D position and orientation tracking system developed for an upper limb rehabilitation robot. Designed {{to work on}} a table-top, the robot is to enable home-based upper-limb rehabilitative exercise for stroke patients. Estimates of the robot's position are computed by fusing data from two tracking systems, each utilizing a different sensor type: laser optical sensors and a webcam. Two laser optical sensors are mounted {{on the underside of the}} robot and track the relative motion of the robot with respect to the surface on which it is placed. The webcam is positioned directly above the workspace, mounted on a <b>fixed</b> <b>stand,</b> and tracks the robot's position with respect to a fixed coordinate system. The optical sensors sample the position data at a higher frequency than the webcam, and a position and orientation fusion scheme is proposed to fuse the data from the two tracking systems. The proposed fusion scheme is validated through an experimental set-up whereby the rehabilitation robot is moved by a humanoid robotic arm replicating previously recorded movements of a stroke patient. The results prove that the presented hybrid position tracking system can track the position and orientation with greater accuracy than the webcam or optical sensors alone. The results also confirm that the developed system is capable of tracking recovery trends during rehabilitation therapy...|$|E
40|$|Background: A better {{understanding}} of the relationship between stand structure and productivity is required for the development of: a) scalable models that can accurately predict growth and yield dynamics for the world’s forests; and b) stand management regimes that maximize wood and/or timber yield, while maintaining structural and species diversity. Methods: We develop a cohort-based canopy competition model (‘‘CAIN’’), parameterized with inventory data from Ontario, Canada, {{to examine the relationship between}} stand structure and productivity. Tree growth, mortality and recruitment are quantified as functions of diameter and asymmetric competition, using a competition index (CAIh) defined as the total projected area of tree crowns at a given tree’s mid-crown height. Stand growth, mortality, and yield are simulated for inventoried stands, and also for hypothetical stands differing in total volume and tree size distribution. Results: For a given diameter, tree growth decreases as CAIh increases, whereas the probability of mortality increases. For a given CAIh, diameter growth exhibits a humped pattern with respect to diameter, whereas mortality exhibits a U-shaped pattern reflecting senescence of large trees. For a fixed size distribution, stand growth increases asymptotically with total density, whereas mortality increases monotonically. Thus, net productivity peaks at an intermediate volume of 100 – 150 m 3 / ha, and approaches zero at 250 m 3 /ha. However, for a <b>fixed</b> <b>stand</b> volume, mortality due to senescence decreases if the proportion of large trees decreases as overall density increases. This size-related reduction in mortality offsets the densityrelate...|$|E
40|$|Ground-based haptic devices {{provide the}} {{capability}} of adding force feedback to virtual environments; however, the physical workspace of such devices is very limited due to the fixed base. By mounting a haptic device on a mobile robot, rather than a <b>fixed</b> <b>stand,</b> the reachable volume can be extended to function in full-scale virtual environments. This work presents the hardware, software, and integration developed to use such a mobile base with a Haption Virtuose™ 6 D 35 - 45. A mobile robot with a Mecanum-style omni-directional drive base and an Arduino-compatible microcontroller development board communicates with software on a host computer to provide a VRPN-based control and data acquisition interface. The position of the mobile robot in the physical space is tracked using an optical tracking system. The SPARTA virtual assembly software was extended to 1) apply transformations to the haptic device data based on the tracked base position, and 2) capture the error between the haptic device’s end effector {{and the center of}} its workspace and command the robot over VRPN to minimize this error. The completed system allows use of the haptic device in a wide area projection screen or head-mounted display virtual environment, providing smooth free-space motion and stiff display of forces to the user throughout the entire space. The availability of haptics in large immersive environments can contribute to future advances in virtual assembly planning, factory simulation, and other operations where haptics {{is an essential part of}} the simulation experience...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Estimating {{the amount}} of {{standing}} deadwood in forests is crucial for assessing wildlife habitat and determining carbon stocks. In this analysis, snags (standing dead trees) {{in various stages of}} decay were inventoried across eight silvicultural treatments in eastern spruce–fir forests in central Maine nearly 60 years after treatments were initiated. Several modeling strategies were developed to estimate number of snags per hectare in various stages of decay. An unmanaged reference area displayed the highest basal area and volume of snags (5. 4 3. 1 m 2 ·ha– 1 and 29. 4 23. 6 m 3 ·ha– 1, respectively, (mean standard deviation)), while the lowest basal area and volume (0. 9 1. 0 m 2 ·ha– 1 and 3. 1 5. 2 m 3 ·ha– 1) were observed in selection system with a 5 -year cutting cycle. Models indicated that snag abundance was related to stand density, depth to water table, and the average harvest interval of the treatment. At a <b>fixed</b> <b>stand</b> density, approximately 140 % more snags were predicted to occur in treatments with an average harvest interval of 55 compared with 5 years. An index of error reflecting the number of snags found in certain decay classes was reduced by 40 % when predictions from count regression models fit with a mixed modeling strategy were used over ordinal regression. Results from these analyses can help to reduce the disparities between observed and modeled snag stocking levels and further our understanding of the relationships between live and standing dead trees inherent to eastern spruce–fir forests.

40|$|Abstract The {{presence}} of some animal species in urban environments can cause numerous health risks and dangers. One {{example is the}} waste generated by bird flocks, {{not to mention the}} distress caused to humans when they inadvertently become the landing spot for this waste. We have studied European starling flocks in Rome after stimulation to flight. Watching a flock of starlings under attack by a predator, they split, merge, and do incredible maneuvers to confuse the predator. The main aim of the investigation is to determine the laws of collective behavior and self-organization of animal aggregations in three dimensions. Many branches of science may be interested in this effort of collecting quantitative data on flocking: biologists, physicists and economists work on extending the starlings ’ collective behavior patterns to such systems as cells in wound healing, aggregates of robots and financial markets. We have acquired a sequence of images of bird flocks with a standard b/w camera (576 × 720 pixels @ 8 bits) at 25 frames per second. The camera was mounted on a <b>fixed</b> <b>stand</b> and its optical axis was set perpendicular to the ground. Images have been acquired during sunset. Feature Tracking was employed because it allows one to determine trajectories by tracking individual tracer particles (birds in this investigation). Numerical models indicate that collective animal behavior may emerge from simple local rules of interaction among the individuals based on few theoretical assumptions: attraction among the individuals, short range repulsion, and alignment of the velocities. By reconstructing the position of individual birds in airborne flocks of few thousands members, it can be demonstrated that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{techniques}} in ‘proximal sensing’ coupled to image analysis insights are assuming {{an increasingly important}} role {{in a variety of}} discipline including ecology, forestry, geology, geography, urban planning, archeology, and civil engineering. In this context, the technique based on the acquisition and analysis of hyperspectral images appears the most suited for landscape classification and evolution over time. At the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of the Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering, an effective methodology for classifying landscapes according to the reflectance characteristics of the materials on the surface has been developed. It is based on the use of two complementary innovative experimental devices and appropriate software for acquiring and analyzing hyperspectral images. The first device is based on the use of three interference filters covering the ranges 400 - 720 nm (VIS), 650 - 1100 nm (NIR) and 850 - 1800 nm (MIR) and comprises one frame grabber with three Camera Link inputs and a trigger signal generator to tune the filter frequency, one solid state disk array of 1 Tbyte, two CMOS Dalsa- 4 M 60 cameras (coupled to the VIS and NIR filters) and one Xenics InGaAs camera (coupled to the MIR filter), one thermal camera, a power supply for all devices and a processing computer for controlling the entire system and acquiring images of the thermal camera via a USB port. The second device employs the same equipments describe above but for the use of two spectrometers instead of three filters, the first spectrometer centered in the visible range (400 nm to 1000 nm, VIS), the second one centered in the near infrared range (from 900 nm to 1800 nm, MIR). The VIS spectrometer is mounted in front of the CMOS camera while the MIR one is mounted in front of the InGaAs camera. The other CMOS camera, equipped with standard lens, is used for georeferencing lines acquired with the spectrometers. In fact, the latter system simultaneously acquires the spectra of a line. Multiple images must be acquired to reconstruct a two-dimensional scene from the combination of several lines. The systems developed have very unique and qualifying characteristics, mainly related to the low cost if compared to other systems available on the market, high spectral resolution, high spatial and temporal resolution, easy portability, both systems have been engineered {{so that they can be}} transported by ultralight airplanes. It is suitable for monitoring areas of extension ranging from small to large. In the latter case a large number of images have to be acquired and joined into one large image without using ground control points. This can be automatically done through a specific software that calculates the correspondences by maximizing the photometric consistency among images through correlation operations. The software accounts for rotations, translations and object size changes in consecutive images. The platforms have been employed for field surveys aimed at acquiring hyperspectral images of objects placed at a distance of some hundreds of meters with the equipment mounted on the <b>fixed</b> <b>stand</b> (usually located uphill) or on aircrafts allowing low altitude flights. The most significant results have been obtained in the fields of vegetation recognition, detection of diseases and abnormalities in the spectral signatures of plant species (organic citrus on the Lentini Plains), identification and characterization of landfills, highlighting the spectral inhomogeneity they are associated with and the variations induced on land and on adjacent vegetation...|$|E
