5|$|Al-Jamri {{has written}} two books in Arabic, Memories of Childhood (2007) and Interventions on Thought and Politics (2008). The former is a {{narrative}} of al-Jamri's childhood in Iraq, the experiences he <b>had</b> <b>and</b> the events he witnessed. He was motivated to write it by people's reactions {{following the death of}} his father and dedicated the book to his memory. The latter deals with political and ideological concepts in Europe and the Muslim world, and how Muslim countries can benefit from them in order to consolidate the political pluralism within the Islamic theme. Al-Jamri also writes a daily column in Al-Wasat and regular articles on politics and human rights for other publications such as Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.|$|E
5|$|During the 2007 season, the Zero-G Rolls {{were removed}} from the ride and {{replaced}} with banked hills. Robin's hill was installed in March and Batman's in April. Batman's train was painted red so that Robin could use it, because Robin's train was damaged during a previous incident. The Robin side re-opened on April 7 and ran until June 28 when it was closed {{for the rest of the}} year. The Batman side did not operate at all, but three of the five cars from the original Robin train were placed on Batman's maintenance track. Because of all of the problems the coaster <b>had</b> <b>and</b> the numerous failed attempts to fix the coaster, Six Flags decided to cut their financial and technical losses and dismantle the ride.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} when Taft met Helen Herron (often called Nellie), {{but it was no}} later than 1880, when she {{mentioned}} in her diary receiving an invitation to a party from him. By 1884, they were meeting regularly, and in 1885, after an initial rejection, she agreed to marry him. The wedding took place at the Herron home on June 19, 1886. William Taft remained devoted to his wife throughout their almost 44 years of marriage.

40|$|This essay explores Hemingway’s {{depiction}} {{of women in}} the novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not. In To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not, the novel explored in this essay, traits of Hemingway’s renowned sexist {{depiction of}} women <b>have</b> been investigated, <b>and</b> the purpose of the essay was to illuminate that the women of To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not are reduced to roles which resembles Simone de Beauvoir’s observations, namely the perception of women as the Other, assuming subordinate roles. In order to achieve this task, a close reading has been done on Hemingway’s novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not, <b>and</b> his portrayal of five female characters in the novel has been analyzed. Simone de Beauvoir’s theory has been applied for an understanding of these female characters in order to see if these women were portrayed in a manner resembling de Beauvoir notions, that is, marked by patriarchal perspectives. The conclusion drawn in this essay is that all the women in the novel are portrayed as "absolute sex", subordinated to men. Thus, the depictions {{of the women in the}} novel To <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> Not were found to correspond to patriarchal gender roles as described by Simone de Beauvoir...|$|R

5|$|After {{the initial}} testing period, the {{sandwich}} was renamed the Big King {{and added to}} the national menu {{at the end of}} the summer of 1997the first major product introduction since the company added its BK Broiler chicken sandwich in 1990. Unlike the Double Supreme, the new Big King lacked the interior bread piece the Big Mac <b>had,</b> <b>and</b> the advertising used to promote the Big King continued to utilize the 75% more beef claim. However, the new sandwich was introduced while the company was dealing with a highly publicized beef recall from one of its key suppliers, Hudson Foods, and had to deal with accusations that the introduction was designed to distract the public and media from the recall. The sandwich was initially introduced in the United States at a 99¢ (USD) price point, which helped propel sales to nearly twice the estimated volume and causing many locations to sell out of the burger patties used to produce the sandwich.|$|E

5|$|Andrić was {{appointed}} Yugoslavia's ambassador to Germany in late March or early April 1939. This appointment, Hawkesworth writes, shows he was highly regarded by his country's leadership. In 1934, Yugoslavia's King Alexander had been assassinated in Marseille. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old son Peter, and a regency council led by Peter's uncle Paul {{was established to}} rule in his place until he turned 18. Paul's government established closer economic and political ties with Germany. In March 1941, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact, pledging support for Germany and Italy. Though the negotiations had occurred behind Andrić's back, {{in his capacity as}} ambassador he was obliged to attend the document's signing in Berlin. Andrić had previously been instructed to delay agreeing to the Axis powers' demands for as long as possible. He was highly critical of the move, and on 17 March, wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking to be relieved of his duties. Ten days later, pro-Western Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers overthrew the regency and proclaimed Peter of age. This led to a breakdown in relations with Germany and prompted Adolf Hitler to order Yugoslavia's invasion. Given these circumstances, Andrić's position was an extremely difficult one. Nevertheless, he used the little influence he <b>had</b> <b>and</b> attempted unsuccessfully to assist Polish prisoners following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, TGS star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{informed}} by Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) that he has health problems as Tracy has a weakened system only found on dead people. Tracy and his wife Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) meet with Jack and Tracy reveals what Dr. Spaceman told him. Angie becomes concerned {{on whether or not}} their family will be taken care of after Tracy dies. Jack offers Angie a job in the entertainment business, and takes the opportunity to get even with Liz by assigning Angie as Liz's intern. Liz realizes that Angie's new job is Jack's way of messing with her, and explains to Angie that as her intern she is not getting paid and fires her. Angie gets upset with Jack and Liz but Jack offers her a reality show during TGSs time slot unless Liz signs the divorce papers. Liz, however, still refuses—even admitting she likes the concept of a reality show starring Angie and would watch it. To get back at Jack, Liz holds a press conference and announces that she and Jack have decided to donate $5million to The Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, The Arts, and Feelings. The next day, Jack and Liz have a sit down meeting with NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane) to discuss their marriage as NBC has strict anti-nepotism guidelines. During the meeting, the two realize that they have had the longest and most meaningful relationship either of them has ever <b>had,</b> <b>and</b> apologize to each other with Liz agreeing to sign the divorce papers and Jack promising to restore TGSs budget.|$|E
5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she <b>had,</b> <b>and</b> was in danger of sinking.|$|E

5|$|Edward II succeeded as king of England on 7 July 1307, on {{the death}} of his father Edward I. The {{expectations}} of the new king were high, and he initially enjoyed a good relationship with the leading magnates of the realm. There were, however, some issues of contention remaining from the reign of his father. Edward I's incessant wars had put a great fiscal burden on the country, and his confrontational style had led to conflict with some of the leading lay and ecclesiastical lords. This had culminated in the drafting of the so-called Remonstrances in 1297, a set of complaints about royal government. By Edward I's death in 1307, most of these issued had been resolved. It was nevertheless in the interest of the leading men of the country to make sure that the new king did not act the way his father <b>had,</b> <b>and</b> ignored the opinions of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|Having raised £100,000, the Cotswold Canals Trust lodged {{the money}} with the Waterways Trust, {{in the hope}} that it could be used as match funding for any grants that might be received. Andy Stumpf became the {{full-time}} Regeneration Programme Manager, working on a major bid application to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to finance the restoration, and the canal was visited by Charles, Prince of Wales, in his capacity as Patron of the Waterways Trust. A Heritage Survey, which cost £60,000 and was funded by the Inland Waterways Association, was carried out, as was a Community Development Plan and a Visitor Management Strategy, costing another £30,000, all of which were pre-requisites for the main HLF bid. By the time the bid was ready for submission, the HLF were under pressure for the funds they <b>had,</b> <b>and</b> asked British Waterways, who were heading up the application, to break the bid and the project into smaller phases. At the end of 2003, a provisional grant of £11.3 million was awarded by the HLF, to enable the restoration of the Stroudwater Navigation between Stonehouse and Wallbridge, and the Thames and Severn Canal between Wallbridge and Brimscombe Port. An additional £2.9 million was received from the European Inter-Regional budget for this first phase. By the time the grant was awarded in January 2006, it had risen to £11.9 million, and a further £6 million of match funding was received from the South West of England Regional Development Agency.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{was while}} Edward was in York that he ordered the {{rehabilitation}} of Henry Percy to his family Earldom on 27 March 1470. On the same day John was elevated to the Marquessate of Montagu, and now outranked his brother- an Earl- in the English peerage. Historians have since questioned, however, whether his new title had the gravitas that his previous Earldom had <b>had,</b> <b>and</b> have even suggested that the king was 'walking a tightrope' as to whether Montagu would actually accept it or not. To compensate him {{for the loss of}} the Percy estates Montagu was granted the lands of the dead Earl of Devon, and Montagu's son, George was created Duke of Bedford. These were substantial estates, providing an income of at least £600 per annum. Montagu was to be the new regional magnate- as he been in the north- to fill an existing power vacuum.|$|E
