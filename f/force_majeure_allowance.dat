40|$|In {{construction}} delay claims, <b>force</b> <b>majeure</b> {{is normally}} {{recognized as an}} excusable risk that entitles contractors only to time extensions, but neither of the contracting parties is entitled to monetary compensation to recover delay damages. However, there are instances where contractors are entitled to both time and cost compensations, as evidenced by some court cases relating to <b>force</b> <b>majeure</b> claims. Such instances involve attributing the occurrence of the <b>force</b> <b>majeure</b> {{to the effect of}} other prior delay events that pushed project performance into the period of the <b>force</b> <b>majeure.</b> Existing delay analysis methods are not capable of addressing this issue, as none take the impact of other delays into consideration when analyzing <b>force</b> <b>majeure</b> claims. Stimulated by this gap, this study proposes an improved and sound method for fairly analyzing the responsibility of <b>force</b> <b>majeure</b> delay claims amongst contracting parties. This method was implemented on a case project to help demonstrate its application and also ascertain its practicability. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it has highlighted the situation of <b>force</b> <b>majeure</b> delay that can be compensable, creating more awareness among researchers and industry practitioners. The second is a proposed systematic process to appropriately analyze its responsibility, which equitably addresses claims from such delays with little or no chance of dispute ensuing...|$|R

Intel from operatives in Eastern Europe suggests that <b>Force</b> <b>Majeure's</b> movements in the abandoned Kellski naval shipyard in Kamchatka, is a potential terrorist threat. The SEALs are sent in to investigate, supported by two Spetsnaz operatives, codenamded Polaris and Bludshot. The team discover evidences that <b>Force</b> <b>Majeure</b> is creating a nuclear bomb. With their findings, the team gets extracted by the USS Michigan. With <b>Force</b> <b>Majeure</b> nowhere to be found, things look grim, but fortunately the Russian Federal Security Service detects the presence of the terrorist group after investigating a supposed nuclear fuel spill. Disguised as members of the decontamination crew, <b>Force</b> <b>Majeure</b> operatives infiltrated the plant with additional terrorists arriving later. Their plan was to steal vast amount of enriched uranium to be use in their [...] "dirty bomb". The SEALs and their comrades are sent into the plant to escort a radioactive specialist, codenamed Flatfoot, to see how much uranium had been stolen. The findings were not good, as almost all of the uranium storages had been empty. In the final mission of the game, the SEALs infiltrates a ship, the Bitter Moon, with a large payload of radioactive material, bound for Seattle, Washington. The terrorists are planning detonate the ship near Seattle.

40|$|Empirical legal {{analysis}} is an emerging discipline of statistical and legal scholarship. Despite its importance, however, {{there is a}} lack of empirical research on the affirmative defense of <b>force</b> <b>majeure,</b> which eliminates liability for a breach of contract in the case of an unforeseeable and uncontrollable event that renders performance impossible. This study seeks to fill the gap in the empirical literature by addressing some central questions on preparing to litigate a <b>force</b> <b>majeure</b> defense. Relying on methods from categorical data analysis, I examine the various criteria that a litigator would use in assessing the strength of a <b>force</b> <b>majeure</b> defense based on contractual terms. This study was supported by a database of manually collected lawsuits, with which I analyzed 291 state and federal <b>force</b> <b>majeure</b> cases from the 19 th century to the present day.
