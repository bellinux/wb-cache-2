These alternate formulations, which involve imposing probabilis-tic structures on a family of deterministic dynamical systems, are shown to yield pointwise equivalent population densities. Moreover, these alternate formulations lead to fast efficient calculations in inverse problems as well as in forward simulations. Here we derive a class of stochastic formulations for which such an alternate representation is readily found...|$|E
40|$|The Kolmogorov theorem gives {{that the}} {{representation}} of continuous and bounded real-valued functions of n variables by the superposition of functions of one variable and addition is always possible.

40|$|Kolmogorov famously {{proved that}} multivariate {{continuous}} functions {{can be represented}} as a superposition of {{a small number of}} univariate continuous functions, f(x_ 1, [...] .,x_n) = ∑_q= 0 ^ 2 n+ 1 χ^q (∑_p= 1 ^n ψ^pq(x_p)). Fridman fridman posed the best smoothness bound for the functions ψ^pq, that such functions can be constructed to be Lipschitz continuous with constant 1. Previous algorithms to describe these inner functions have only been Hölder continuous, such as those proposed by Köppen and Braun and Griebel. This is problematic, as pointed out by Griebel, in that non-smooth functions have very high storage/evaluation complexity, and this makes <b>Kolmogorov's</b> <b>representation</b> (KR) impractical using the standard definition of the inner functions. To date, no one has presented a method to compute a Lipschitz continuous inner function. In this paper, we revisit Kolmogorov's theorem along with Fridman's result. We examine a simple Lipschitz function which appear to satisfy the necessary criteria for <b>Kolmogorov's</b> <b>representation,</b> but fails in the limit. We then present a full solution to the problem, including an algorithm that computes such a Lipschitz function. Comment: 18 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Hilbert’s 13 th problem {{asked whether}} every {{continuous}} multivariate function {{can be written}} as superposition of continuous functions of 2 variables. Kolmogorov and Arnold show that every continuous multivariate function can be represented as superposition of continuous univariate functions and addition in a universal form and thus solved the problem positively. In <b>Kolmogorov’s</b> <b>representation,</b> only one univariate function (the outer function) depends on {{and all the other}} univariate functions (inner functions) are independent of the multivariate function to be represented. This greatly inspired research on representation and superposition of functions using Kolmogorov’s superposition theorem (KST). However, the numeric applications and theoretic development of KST is considerably limited {{due to the lack of}} smoothness of the univariate functions in the representation. Therefore, we investigate the properties of the outer and inner functions in detail. We show that the outer function for a given multivariate function is not unique, does not preserve the positivity of the multivariate function and has a largely degraded modulus of continuity. The structure of the set of inner functions only depends on the number of variables of the multivariate function. We show that inner functions constructed in <b>Kolmogorov’s</b> <b>representation</b> for continuous functions of a fixed number of variables can be reused by extension or projection to represent continuous functions of a different number of variables. After an investigation of the functions in KST, we combine KST with Fourier transform and write a formula regarding the change of the outer functions under different inner functions for a given multivariate function. KST is also applied to estimate the optimal cost between measures in high dimension by the optimal cost between measures in low dimension. Furthermore, we apply KST to image encryption and show that the maximal error can be obtained in the encryption schemes we suggested. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Let {{be a real}} {{separable}} Hilbert space; let X(t), t[epsilon][0, 1], be a separable, stochastically continuous, -valued {{stochastic process}} with independent increments. Then a decomposition of X(t) into a uniformly convergent sum of independent processes is found. In this decomposition one of the processes is Gaussian with continuous sample functions, and {{the remainder of the}} processes have sample functions whose discontinuities correspond to those of certain real-valued Poisson processes. The decomposition of X(t) leads to a Lévy-Khintchine representation of the characteristic functional of X(t). In addition, the case when X(t) has finite variance is explored, and, {{as a consequence of the}} above decomposition, a Kolmogorov-type representation of the characteristic functional of X(t) is derived.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The key {{result in}} the paper {{concerns}} two transformations, Φ: (ρ, ψ) ↦ → ϕ and Bt: ψ ↦ → ϕ, where ρ, ψ, ϕ are states on the algebra of non-commutative polynomials, or equivalently joint distributions of d-tuples of non-commuting operators. These transformations are related to free probability: if ⊞ is the free convolution operation, and {ρt} is a free convolution semigroup, we show that Φ [ρ, ψ ⊞ ρt] = Bt[Φ [ρ, ψ]]. The maps {Bt} were introduced by Belinschi and Nica as a semigroup of transformations such that B 1 is the bijection between infinitely divisible distributions in Boolean and free probability theories. They showed that for γt the free heat semigroup and Φ the Boolean version of the <b>Kolmogorov</b> <b>representation</b> for infinitely divisible measures, Φ [ψ ⊞ γt] = Bt[Φ [ψ]]. The more general map Φ [ρ, ψ] comes, not from free probability, but from the theory of two-state algebras, also called the conditionally free probability theory, introduced by Bo˙zejko, Leinert, and Speicher. Orthogonality of the c-free versions of the Appell polynomials, investigated in [Ans 08 b], {{is closely related to}} the map Φ. On the other hand, more general free Meixner families behave well under all the transformations above, and provide clues to their general behavior. Besides the evolution equation, other results include the positivity of the map Φ [ρ, ψ] and descriptions of its fixed points and range. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} a robust state estimation problem for discrete-time, homogeneous, first-order, finite-state finite-alphabet hidden Markov models (HMMs). Based on Kolmogorov's Theorem {{on the existence}} of a process, we first present the Kolmogorov model for the HMMs under consideration. A new change of measure is introduced. The statistical properties of the <b>Kolmogorov</b> <b>representation</b> of an HMM are discussed on the canonical probability space. A special Kolmogorov measure is constructed. Meanwhile, the ergodicity of two expanded Markov chains is investigated. In order to describe the uncertainty of HMMs, we study probability distance problems based on the Kolmogorov model of HMMs. Using a change of measure technique, the relative entropy and the relative entropy rate as probability distances between HMMs, are given in terms of the HMM parameters. Also, we obtain a new expression for a probability distance considered in the existing literature such that we can use an information state method to calculate it. Furthermore, we introduce regular conditional relative entropy as an a posteriori probability distance to measure the discrepancy between HMMs when a realized observation sequence is given. A representation of the regular conditional relative entropy is derived based on the Radon-Nikodym derivative. Then a recursion for the regular conditional relative entropy is obtained using an information state method. Meanwhile, the well-known duality relationship between free energy and relative entropy is extended to the case of regular conditional relative entropy given a sub-[special character]-algebra. Finally, regular conditional relative entropy constraints are defined based on the study of the probability distance problem. Using a Lagrange multiplier technique and the duality relationship for regular conditional relative entropy, a finite horizon robust state estimator for HMMs with regular conditional relative entropy constraints is derived. A complete characterization of the solution to the robust state estimation problem is also presented...|$|E

The proof {{is based on a}} general closedness theorem for sum spaces of measurable functions. The main results are of interest for the structure of generalized Schroedinger bridges. They also allow to prove an interesting structural result for distributions with multivariate marginals, to prove existence results for optimal approximations in additive statistical models, and to give an extension of <b>Kolmogorov's</b> famous <b>representation</b> theorem for continuous functions of several variables.

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{classical}} Kolmogorov and quantum probability models. We {{show that the}} gap between these model is not so huge as it was commonly believed. The main structures of quantum theory (interference of probabilities, Born’s rule, complex probabilistic amplitudes, Hilbert state space, representation of observables by operators) are present in a latent form in the Kolmogorov model. In particular, we obtain “interference of probabilities ” without {{to appeal to the}} Hilbert space formalism. We interpret “interference of probabilities” as a perturbation (by a cos-term) of the conventional formula of total probability.

40|$|We {{constructed}} a Hilbert space {{representation of a}} contextual <b>Kolmogorov</b> model. This <b>representation</b> is based on two fundamental observables – in the standard quantum model these are the position and momentum observables. This representation has all distinguishing features of the quantum model. Thus in spite all “No-Go ” theorems (e. g., von Neumann, Kochen and Specker, [...] ., Bell) we found the realist basis of quantum mechanics. Our representation is not standard model with hidden variables. In particular, {{this is not a}} reduction of the quantum model to the classical one. Moreover, we see that such a reduction is even in principle impossible. This impossibility is not the consequence of a mathematical theorem but it follows from the physical structure of the model. By our model quantum states are very rough images of domains in the space of fundamental parameters- PRESPACE. Those domains represent complexes of physical conditions. By our model both classical and quantum physics describe REDUCTION of PRESPACE-INFORMATION. Quantum mechanics is not complete. In particular, there are prespace contexts which can be represented only by a so called hyperbolic quantum model.
