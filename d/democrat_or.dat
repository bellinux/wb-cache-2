If no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, the two candidates with the highest vote totals compete in a runoff election approximately one month later.

In that campaign, Tatangelo said that he had been a Democrat since 1936, when he was still living in Rhode Island. In Texas, one is officially a [...] "Democrat" [...] or a [...] "Republican," [...] for that matter, only if he votes in his party's primary election or runoff election in the spring of even years.

In that the majority of Texas voters do not usually participate in any party primary, most of the state's electorate consists of unaffiliated voters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{national}} visibility Cisneros gained {{as mayor}} of San Antonio led to President Ronald Reagan appointing him in 1983 to the Bipartisan Commission on Central America, chaired by Henry Kissinger. In 1984, Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale tapped Cisneros as {{a finalist for the}} vice presidential nomination, which eventually went to U.S. Rep. Geraldine Ferraro. [...] Cisneros was selected to give the highly visible “Platform Presentation” at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco on July 17, 1984. [...] His viability as a national leader was confirmed in 1985 when Cisneros was elected president of the National League of Cities. [...] In 1986, City and State Magazine selected him as the “Outstanding Mayor” in the nation. [...] A scholarly study of America’s mayors, The American Mayor, ranked Cisneros as one of the 15 best mayors in the nation in a period that spanned the 20th century. [...] He was consistently touted as senatorial and/or gubernatorial material throughout his tenure as mayor, and was identified positively by both conservatives and liberals. [...] In Señor Alcalde ("Mr. Mayor"), John Gillies wrote: [...] "He tried to avoid a political label, such as <b>Democrat</b> <b>or</b> Republican, because he wanted to consider the needs of all of San Antonio's groupings.... He formed a bridge between conservatives and liberals..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Portman {{graduated}} from Cincinnati Country Day School in 1974, {{where he had}} served as treasurer of his class, enjoyed playing baseball, and developed an interest in politics, later telling the National Review, [...] " [...] I wasn't a <b>Democrat</b> <b>or</b> a Republican. No one in my family had ever been in politics. My dad thought {{it was something that}} got in the way." [...] He went on to attend Dartmouth College, where he started leaning to the right, and majored in anthropology and earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 1978. At Dartmouth, {{he was a member of}} the Ledyard Canoe Club, and went on several kayaking and canoeing expeditions around the world. He spent summers throughout college in the American West, on cattle farms and ranches, tending to livestock, riding horses, and assisting in related chores. In Cincinnati, Portman worked on Bill Gradison's Congressional campaign, and Gradison soon became a mentor to Portman. Portman next entered the University of Michigan Law School, earning his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1984 and serving as vice president of the student senate. During law school, Portman embarked on a kayaking and hiking trip across China, and, not long before, blind dated a young Democratic volunteer, Jane Dudley. Dudley's aunt and uncle lived in Cincinnati and were friends with Portman's parents. Dudley embarked on a hiking trip with her aunt in the Himalayas, and took part in the date with Portman following her aunt's advice. Dudley had become interested in politics by working for a family friend who was running for the state legislature in North Carolina. She majored in political science at Vanderbilt University, and wanted to work on Capitol Hill. She then worked in a U.S. Senate campaign in 1984 for Jim Hunt who was governor of North Carolina. After graduating from law school, Portman moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked for the law firm Patton Boggs. Portman next became an associate at Graydon Head & Ritchie law firm in Cincinnati.|$|E

60|$|In {{describing}} {{the two parties}} into which modern society divides itself,--the democrat and the conservative,--I said, Bonaparte represents the <b>democrat,</b> <b>or</b> the party of men of business, against the stationary or conservative party. I omitted then to say, what is material to the statement, namely, that these two parties differ only as young and old. The democrat is a young conservative; the conservative is an old democrat. The aristocrat is the democrat ripe, and gone to seed,--because both parties stand on the one ground of the supreme value of property, which one endeavors to get, {{and the other to}} keep. Bonaparte may be said to represent the whole history of this party, its youth and its age; yes, and with poetic justice, its fate, in his own. The counter-revolution, the counter-party, still waits for its organ and representative, in a lover and a man of truly public and universal aims.|$|E

6000|$|There is no average {{member of}} the public who would not prefer to have Lloyd George {{discussed}} as what he is, a Welshman of genius and ideals, strangely fascinated by bad fashion and bad finance, rather than discussed as what neither he nor anyone else ever was, a perfect <b>democrat</b> <b>or</b> an utterly detestable demagogue.

There is no man in the street who could not understand (and like) Rufus Isaacs as a Jew better than he can possibly like him as a British statesman.

6000|$|The {{prevailing}} {{system of}} education, {{which we have}} inherited from the past, largely fails to accomplish this. In the first place, it has been authoritative rather than scientific, {{which is to say}} that students have been induced to accept the statements of teachers and text books, and have not been trained to weigh for themselves their reasonableness and worth; a principle essentially unscientific and undemocratic, since it inculcates in the future citizen convictions rather than encourages the habit of open-mindedness so necessary for democratic citizenship. For democracy--it cannot be too often repeated--is a dynamic thing, experimental, creative in its very essence. No static set of opinions can apply to the constantly changing aspect of affairs. New discoveries, which come upon us with such bewildering rapidity, are apt abruptly to alter social and industrial conditions, while morals and conventions are no longer absolute. Sudden crises threaten the stability of nations and civilizations. Safety lies alone in the ability to go forward, to progress. Psychology teaches us that if authoritative opinions, convictions, or [...] "complexes" [...] are stamped upon the plastic brain of the youth they tend to harden, and he is apt to become a <b>Democrat</b> <b>or</b> Republican, an Episcopalian or a Baptist, a free trader or a tariff advocate or a Manchester economist without asking why. Such [...] "complexes" [...] were probably referred to by the celebrated physician who emphasized the hopelessness of most individuals over forty. And every reformer and forum lecturer knows how difficult it is to convert the average audience of seasoned adults to a new idea: he finds the most responsive groups in the universities and colleges. It is significant that the [...] "educated" [...] adult audiences in clubs and prosperous churches are the least open to conversion, because, in the scientific sense, the [...] "educated" [...] classes retain complexes, and hence are the least prepared to cope with the world as it is today. The German system, which has been bent upon installing authoritative conviction instead of encouraging freedom of thought, should be a warning to us.|$|E
