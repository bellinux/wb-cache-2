40|$|This {{study will}} {{demonstrate}} {{the importance of}} application of computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines in generation of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> with new topology. This topology decreases gear vibration and will extend the gear capacity and service life. A preliminary investigation by a tooth contact analysis (TCA) program has shown that <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> in line contact (for instance, involute helical gears with parallel axes, worm gear drives with cylindrical worms, etc.) {{are very sensitive to}} angular errors of misalignment that cause edge contact and an unfavorable shape of transmission errors and vibration. The new topology of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> is based on the localization of bearing contact, and the synthesis of a predesigned parabolic function of transmission errors that is able to absorb a piecewise linear function of transmission errors caused by gear misalignment. The report will describe the following topics: description of kinematics of CNC machines with six degrees of freedom that can be applied for generation of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> with new topology. A new method for grinding of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> by a cone surface or surface of revolution based on application of CNC machines is described. This method provides an optimal approximation of the ground surface to the given one. This method is especially beneficial when undeveloped ruled surfaces are to be ground. Execution of motions of the CNC machine is also described. The solution to this problem can be applied as well for the transfer of machine tool settings from a conventional generator to the CNC machine.

40|$|Regarding <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> shape {{measurement}} and the uncertainty evaluation method <b>Gear</b> <b>tooth</b> shape deviation {{can be divided}} into three types: profile deviations, helix deviations, and pitch deviations. Fig. 1 represents the principle behind gear deviation measurement. In all of the deviation measurements, measurement values are obtained from the y-position of the stylus. Therefore, the y-position of the stylus represents the output quantity. Other quantities (stylus x-position, stylus z-position, and <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>surface</b> position) represent the input quantities. Accordingly, if we search for a point on the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>surface</b> whose x-coordinate and z-coordinate are equal to x- and z-position of the stylus, the y-coordinate of the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>surface</b> should be equal to the y-position of the stylus.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} when standard spur gears are in mesh is the appearance of edge contact on the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> caused by misalignments. Those misalignments are caused partially by deflections of gear supporting shafts. As {{a result of an}} edge contact, a non-favorable condition of the bearing contact occurs, yielding high level of contact stresses. An intensive research and many practical solutions have been directed to modify the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> in order to avoid edge contact. An innovative procedure is proposed here for: (1) determination of errors of alignment caused by shaft deflections, (2) compensation of predicted shaft deflections during generation of spur gears, and (3), obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors for the design load. A finite element model of a spur gear drive that comprises pinion and gear supporting shafts is used for the determination of errors of alignment along a cycle of meshing. Compensation of misalignments caused by shaft deflections in gear generation is then accomplished by modification of pinion tooth surfaces whereas the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> are kept unmodified. Additional modifications of pinion tooth surfaces may be required for obtaining a favorable function of transmission errors. The effect of several misalignment compensations in the reduction of contact stresses has been investigated. Postprocessing of load intensity functions and loaded transmission errors is included. The developed approach is illustrated with numerical examples.

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{spiral bevel}} gear NC {{manufacture}} principle and generating motion of the generating gear and the work gear, the NC generation of {{spiral bevel gear}} cutting is realized {{by means of the}} vector transformation. As sophisticated calculation of the transformation is hard to implement in each interpolation cycle of NC machining, the coordinated motion of NC coordinate axes is expressed as quintic parametric spline functions, which use the rotation angle of the work gear as the parameter. The constrained optimization method of three design variables is established to obtain contacting points of <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> <b>surfaces,</b> which are acquired by solving nonlinear equations sets traditionally. The condition of normal coincidence is simplified and the object function of the equal position vectors of mating gears is established.
