25|$|<b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> as {{a student}} of politics, rather than someone {{involved}} in politics, and he always struck me as someone who was a statesman {{as well as a}} politician, someone who was in politics for all the right reasons, and someone who made a huge contribution to the peace process bringing reconciliation for all that had happened in the past. And I think that today of all days with the state visit and the warm relationship between Britain and Ireland that he can see that some of his work being completed.|$|E
500|$|Yet, {{when asked}} what he liked about Youkilis, former Boston scout Matt Haas said: [...] "At first glance, not a lot. He was unorthodox. He had an extreme crouch—his thighs were almost {{parallel}} to the ground. And he was heavier than he is now. But the more <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him,</b> the more I just thought, 'Throw the tools out the window. This guy can play baseball.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Brown, {{the coach}} of the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), met Humble while vacationing in Florida in 1946. Brown came to watch the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day, and was staying in the same hotel as the Rice team. He saw Humble and his wife Lorraine, whom Humble had met while in {{training}} at Southwestern, on a dance floor at the hotel. [...] "He appeared to be the sort of fellow we like to have on our team," [...] Brown said later in 1947. [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> in that Tennessee game and after that made up my mind he'd be with my club if I ever had the chance to make a deal for him." [...] The AAFC's Baltimore Colts selected Humble in the league's draft, but Brown got his chance in August. He engineered a trade that sent four players including quarterback Steve Nemeth and guard George Cheroke to the Colts, plus two players to be named later.|$|E

6000|$|... "Uncle Dick {{passed me}} two minutes arterwards without a word, {{and set off}} down the road as fast as 'is little legs 'ud carry <b>'im.</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>'im</b> out o' sight, and then I went on board the {{schooner}} to see how 'Arry 'ad got on.|$|R
5000|$|... "For my money, Tony Bennett is {{the best}} singer in the business. He excites me when <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him.</b> He moves me. He's the singer who gets across what the {{composer}} has in mind, and probably a little more." [...] —Frank Sinatra, in a 1965 Life magazine interview ...|$|R
500|$|After England had amassed 496 in {{the first}} innings, Australia had slumped to 3/68 with Bradman one of the {{dismissed}} batsmen. Harvey, {{the youngest member of}} the squad, joined cavalier all-rounder Keith Miller. Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead. Upon arriving in the middle, Miller greeted him cheerfully and said to Harvey, [...] "OK, mate, get up the other end. [...] I'll take the bowling for a while until you get yourself organised." [...] Harvey said, [...] "Mate, that will do me." [...] I couldn't get up the other end quick enough. [...] <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> play a few overs and I thought, [...] "This is good", and then they brought Laker on to bowl. [...] The third and the fifth balls of Laker's over disappeared over my head, on the way up, and they both finished in the crowd for six[...] [...] [...] I can honestly thank Keith Miller for the confidence he gave me during our partnership [...] [...] [...] and it did so much for my future cricket career." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the [...] "loud guffaws" [...] {{among the}} Philadelphia press, Yankees manager Casey Stengel {{endorsed}} {{the hiring of}} Smith, saying:"Mayo will make good. [...] He {{is one of the}} coming young managers in baseball. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> closely in my advance camps, and he was the one manager in the Yankee chain who asked questions, who wanted to know why I liked things done this way and not that way. He never intimated that he knew all the answers. [...] He kept notes, and he learned." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> {{down the}} avenue, {{wondering}} at his strange silence. It had a curious effect upon me. I {{would rather have}} heard threats--even a torrent of anger. There was something curiously ominous in that slow, wordless exit. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> uneasily, full of dim, shapeless fears.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{right that}} he would cut our throats if it served his purpose," [...] I answered. [...] "He's servile, and servility {{goes hand in hand}} with treachery. The more <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him,</b> the more <b>I</b> see 'scoundrel' written in large type on every bend of the fellow's oily shoulders." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> hit the ground, {{and turn}} to look for more Boche, {{but there is not}} a plane in the sky; so I point my machine home and am greeted by hand shakes and cheers. [...] "Oh yes we saw the beggar go down in flames, so we came home." ...|$|R
60|$|He lay for a {{long time}} {{breathing}} deeply, <b>I</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him.</b> Then, as he reached out and took my hand, I knew by some instinct what was to come. I summoned all my self-command to meet his eye. I knew that the malicious and unthinking gossip of the town had reached him, and that he had received it in the simple faith of his hopes.|$|R
60|$|Trembling with excitement, <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> {{push the}} hand round as he described.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{sank back}} {{in one of}} the high-backed chairs and <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him,</b> frightened.|$|E
60|$|Our eyes met. Poirot's were pleasantly vague. He {{got up and}} hummed {{a little}} tune. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> suspiciously.|$|E
60|$|He puffed away {{in silence}} for a few seconds, while <b>I</b> sat <b>watching</b> <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> had never seen a ghost smoking a pipe before, that I could remember, and it {{interested}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite true; <b>I</b> have <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> {{content with}} the level my impertinent {{children}} assign him here, but now trying to be manly for Essie's sake. You have not told me of Sydney." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{are at the}} Mansion House Banquet, and John Dillon {{is making}} the first speech he has made before a popular Dublin {{audience}} {{since the death of}} Parnell; and I have several times to keep my London delegates from interrupting. Dillon is very nervous, and as <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> the abstract passion begins to rise within me, and I am almost overpowered by an instinct of cruelty; I long to cry out, [...] "Had Zimri peace who slew his master?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{rose from}} the bed, yawned, and taking it in his hand, held it to the light. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> curiously.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> {{narrowly}} the while, for I {{had some}} notion he might run me through. But I had misjudged him.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Baron von Knigenstein {{has been}} there alone, incognito, {{for more than an}} hour. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> go in--and watched him out." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> stood <b>watching</b> <b>him,</b> {{wondering}} {{where he could}} be going. He stumbled a little further, where the mud began to get softer and deeper, but struggling up again, went hopping on towards the river.|$|R
60|$|MRS. DAVIDSON--[Suddenly murmuring {{aloud to}} herself--happily.] He's such a dear! <b>I</b> could stay <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> forever.|$|R
60|$|Now Userti {{shifted her}} eyes from me to Seti, <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> very closely. Seated at his side upon the ground with my writing roll spread across my knee, <b>I,</b> too, <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> closely, and noted that his lips turned white and his face grew fixed and strange.|$|R
60|$|We {{got into}} the barn unperceived, and <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> climb the ladder to the loft. Then I went indoors to tell them.|$|E
6000|$|As he absently {{tied the}} poker into hard knots with his nervous fingers, <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> with some interest. Suddenly {{he turned toward}} me:-- ...|$|E
60|$|I {{pointed to}} where it lay gleaming in the moonlight. He {{picked it up and}} set it to an undischarged barrel. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> curiously.|$|E
60|$|He stopped, and for {{the first}} time in his life the doubt of himself crossed his mind. As <b>I</b> sat <b>watching</b> <b>him,</b> the joy died out of his face, and the first hint of age passed over it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see him at}} {{his worst}} every day. <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> in his sleep. I know every change of his face. But when I married Richard I was quite determined, Esther, if heaven would help me, never to show him that I grieved {{for what he did}} and so to make him more unhappy. I want him, when he comes home, to find no trouble in my face. I want him, when he looks at me, to see what he loved in me. I married him to do this, and this {{supports}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Wilfred," [...] {{said the}} old lady, [...] "will our man-power stand it? Couldn't they watch each other? Or, {{if it would be}} any help, <b>I</b> could <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> myself. <b>I</b> took such a fancy to his dear dog." ...|$|R
6000|$|AUSTIN. [...] Thorold's gone, [...] I {{know not}} how, across the meadow-land. [...] <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> till I lost {{him in the}} skirts [...] O' the beech-wood.|$|E
60|$|After which <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> {{show with}} three bits {{of bread and}} two olives and a dessert knife {{the way in which}} the German army could be destroyed.|$|E
60|$|My {{excitement}} communicated {{itself to}} the boy. He tumbled back into his punt, and pushed off vigorously. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> land, and disappear {{in the direction of}} the village.|$|E
6000|$|Don Jose (aside). He is unused to menial labor. If I {{should be}} right in my suspicions! if he really were Dona Jovita's secret lover! This gallantry with the {{servants}} only a deceit! Bueno! <b>I</b> will <b>watch</b> <b>him.</b> (Aloud.) Chocolate, Diego! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had stepped}} {{underneath}} the open hatchway so that I could see him. The lack of {{expression on his}} face, so different from when <b>I</b> had <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> unseen, was enhanced by the unblinking, staring eyes. It was not a pleasant face to look upon.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} that we can do better than put on that young trumpeter till you can play again. <b>I</b> have <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> several times at practice, and he always keeps his wickets up well, and hits freely {{whenever}} he gets a chance." ...|$|R
