Molyneux then developed a 2D prototype containing features that made it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> game. The prototype focused on constructing the dungeon, and included the Treasure room, Hatchery, Training room, and Dungeon Heart. The characters were designed by the artist, Mark Healey.|$|E

The third session saw no comeback from Murphy and O'Sullivan progressed to the quarter-finals 13−7. The quarter-finals would be the furthest O'Sullivan would progress, as he fell behind Ding Junhui 6–10 after the opening two sessions. Despite scoring the tournament's highest break with a 146 in the final session, he would eventually lose 10–13. Following his loss, O'Sullivan stated {{that he had no}} intention of retiring.|$|E

5|$|England batted on {{for five}} minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley {{declared}} at 8/365.

5|$|England {{declared}} at 8/365 {{after two}} overs {{on the last}} day.
