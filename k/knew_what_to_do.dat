5|$|Aerox at Destructoid {{said that}} the game {{inherits}} issues from previous Ace Attorney games, such as how evidence sometimes can only be presented when the game's script allows it, and how it sometimes is unclear how to trigger events during investigations; he did however note that these occur less frequently than in previous Ace Attorney games. Osborn criticized the cross-examinations, saying that objections that should logically be valid are sometimes not accepted by the game, and that the player often has to resort to trial and error. Meanwhile, Bryan Vore at Game Informer {{said that the}} in-game task list and new way of traveling made sure that he never felt lost during investigations, and <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to proceed. Urara Honma at Famitsu also noted the hints and lower difficulty as helpful features.|$|E
25|$|The di Marcos are now deemed as {{something}} of a failure for EastEnders. Since their departure, the family has even been mocked in an EastEnders official book, entitled EastEnders 20 Years In Albert Square. In the book, the author, Rupert Smith, writes :"Nobody really <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the di Marco family, who had been languishing in the pizza restaurant without a decent storyline between them. Finally, there was nothing else for it: the di Marcos would have to go. All of them…it was as if they'd never been".|$|E

As a result of the battle the Royal Navy found heavy use of the Levant company ships.

He inherited wealth from his grandfather, who with seven of his sons, had developed and prospered from coal and iron workings.

25|$|On 27 February 1985 Doctor Who {{was placed}} on an 18-month hiatus. The BBC {{originally}} planned to axe the series as they wished to spend its budgets on new programming for the channel, but was forced to back down from public pressure and Doctor Who returned in September 1986. At the time Michael Grade and Jonathan Powell were blamed for the decision (Grade {{was the target of}} death threats) but it was later revealed that the decision was taken due to the series running out of creative inspiration, making it impossible to find anyone (at the time) who <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the series.|$|E
25|$|By mid-1917, {{plans for}} {{infantry}} attacks {{were determined by}} the artillery support that could be provided. Commanders planned attacks to create the conditions {{for success in the}} absence of voice communication and attacks were limited to the range of artillery covering fire. Infantry units were to follow a creeping barrage, pausing at intermediate objectives to reorganise behind standing barrages and then dig in on the final objective, behind a protective barrage. In February 1917, infantry units were organised and equipped on a standard pattern and trained to achieve their objectives so that each man <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and the drills to follow in certain circumstances. SS 143 Instructions for the training of Platoons for Offensive Action) prescribed a platoon organisation of four sections, the Lewis gun and rifle-grenade sections for firepower and the rifle and bombing sections for manoeuvre. The platoon was to seek opportunities for flank attacks and to use initiative rather than refer back for orders. The new infantry platoon organisation and training gave infantry the capacity to succeed despite casualties to officers and NCOs and sometimes after losing the creeping barrage.|$|E

Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Joel [...] "made that up." [...] The Wachowskis themselves claim they [...] "decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut." [...] They had the idea to write a story about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong. They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because {{those are the kinds of}} films that they like to watch. Seeing film noir as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described Billy Wilder as a big influence.|$|E
500|$|AJ is an {{extension}} to the established Masood family, the younger brother of established character Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra). He is disliked by Masood's wife Zainab (Nina Wadia), but brings out a previously unseen fun side to his brother. AJ is portrayed as a mechanic who is cheeky, fun-loving, irresponsible, annoying and spontaneous, though he makes decisions by flipping a coin. He has received mixed comments from critics, with Ally Ross from The Sun calling him [...] "supposedly funny" [...] and wanting him to [...] "piss off", Laura White from Inside Soap saying he is [...] "the perfect tonic for a family almost constantly dogged with crisis", and Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton.com praising the character but wondering if the writers <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with him. His storylines have since included a feud with Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman), divorcing his wife Aliyah Ahmed (Ann Wenn) and lending support to Masood through financial problems and his breakup with Zainab.|$|E

For most of her career Wagoner hit for batting average, moving along baserunners as an occasional slugger and often appeared among the league's top twenty hitters. A smart and alert runner, she moved aggressively in the right situations to take the extra base. Armed with a strong, accurate throwing arm, she had good range at right field, catching almost everything that came her way and always <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the ball.

The studio made no attempts to sell the film to a mainstream audience with traditional promotion, although there was some magazine advertising (primarily in Marvel Comics) and related licensing which served as viral advertising in limited venues. Studio publicist Rosemary LaSalmandra said, [...] "Nobody <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Buckaroo Banzai.
