40|$|Abstract. Stimuli-sensitive {{change their}} volume (equilibrium degree of swelling), {{mechanical}} properties (elasticity, stiffness) and molecular transport properties {{in response to}} a small change in the properties of the swelling agent, like temperature, solvent composition, pH value, ion concentration, etc. Widespread used smart gels take advantages of the volume phase transition induced by a change of temperature. The temperature of volume phase transition depends on the interaction between gel and solvent. For a gel with defined chemical structure it can be changed by the composition of the swelling agent, e. g. content of salt or organic components. For application, e. g. in MEMS, an easy and controlled stimulation of volume phase transition is required. The degree of swelling (Q) and therefore the dimension of gel structures are determined by temperature. It is possible to regulate Q to a predetermined value by heating/cooling. Thermal energy inside a gel-based device can be easily generated and regulated by incorporated <b>heating</b> <b>resistors</b> and temperature sensors. Different structures (micro-spheres, pads, patterned layers) of smart hydrogels are applied. The switching between two different states of swelling is induced by changes of temperature or by changing the environment. Using the example of gel-based microvalves, sensors, sensor arrays, pumps, and chemostats (concentration control of chemical substances) the sensor-actuator properties and advantages of this group of polymers are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A typical {{limitation}} of intelligent devices {{based on the}} use of shape-memory polymers as actuators is linked to the widespread use of distributed <b>heating</b> <b>resistors,</b> via Joule effect, as activation method, which involves several relevant issues needing attention, such as: (a) Final device size is importantly increased due to the additional space required for the resistances; (b) the use of resistances limits materials’ strength and the obtained devices are normally weaker; (c) the activation process through heating resistances is not homogeneous, thus leading to important temperature differences among the polymeric structure and to undesirable thermal gradients and stresses, also limiting the application fields of shape-memory polymers. In our present work we describe interesting activation alternatives, based on coating shape-memory polymers with different kinds of conductive materials, including textiles, conductive threads and conductive paint, which stand out for their easy, rapid and very cheap implementation. Distributed heating and homogeneous activation can be achieved in several of the alternatives studied and the technical results are comparable to those obtained by using advanced shape-memory nanocomposites, which have to deal with complex synthesis, processing and security aspects. Different combinations of shape memory epoxy resin with several coating electrotextiles, conductive films and paints are prepared, simulated with the help of thermal finite element method based resources and characterized using infrared thermography for validating the simulations and overall design process.

The resistance {{change as a}} function of pressure depends strongly on the thermal resistance of the two metal lines connecting the <b>heated</b> <b>resistor</b> to the silicon bulk (cold junction) and on the thermal resistance of the silicon nitride. Relative resistance changes ranging from about 3 % (small membrane) to 20 % (bridge) per mW of input power were obtained when operating the devices in constant voltage mode.

Devices with ‘d’ ranging from 50 µm to 1, 200 µm were fabricated. Assuming that pressures can be reliably measured above the 10 % and below the 90 % points of the resistance versus pressure curve, the range of these devices is about two orders of magnitude. By integrating two devices, one with d = 65 µm and one with d = 1, 200 µm on the same chip and connecting them in series, the range can be increased by about a factor of three.
