5|$|The {{stained glass}} windows of the nave's north and south aisles {{represent}} one aspect of this synthesis. The north windows depict Biblical figures and scenes, while the south windows contain images associated with <b>human</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The lower of these, at the triforium level, depict the teachings of Christ, while the six upper windows at the clerestory level depict influential figures in Philosophy, Theology, Chivalry, Poetry, Law, and Science, as read from east to west. The Science window faces a window due to Willet on the north wall with scenes from Genesis, symbolizing harmony between the Christian story of the Creation and the modern means of understanding it.|$|E

While it is {{difficult}} for a beginner rider to operate a two-wheeled vehicle, a skilled rider is able to operate the vehicle cleverly using <b>human</b> MIMO <b>knowledge.</b> In this paper, an intelligent 2 -wheeled vehicle driving support (i 2 DS) system, which applies the intelligent MIMO control (iMIMOc) method that can be built using <b>human</b> MIMO <b>knowledge,</b> is proposed. Operation instructions from the i 2 DS system are accessibly presented to a user by using plural driving support interfaces. The effectiveness of this system is confirmed.

25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{researchers}} {{predicted that}} when <b>human</b> <b>knowledge</b> could be expressed using logic with mathematical notation, {{it would be}} possible to create a machine that reasons, or artificial intelligence. This was more difficult than expected because of the complexity of human reasoning. In logic programming, a program consists of a set of axioms and rules.

Haggard said the Bible is true and doesn't contradict itself as science does.
