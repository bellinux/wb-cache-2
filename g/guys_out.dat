Bruce explained that their Dark Carnival mythology [...] "comes from the basic principle of right and wrong, you know. Evil and good. That's all.

500|$|Longtime scout Charlie Metro {{remembered the}} havoc caused by Henderson: '"I {{did a lot}} of study and I found that it's {{impossible}} to throw Rickey Henderson out. I started using stopwatches and everything. I found it was impossible to throw some other <b>guys</b> <b>out</b> also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it." ...|$|E

She defended her actions {{in response to}} the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security. Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning {{about whether or not the}} administration had issued inaccurate [...] "talking points" [...] after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, [...] "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of <b>guys</b> <b>out</b> for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make?

[...] "We had the tackle, but we didn't secure it and let the <b>guy</b> <b>out</b> the {{backside}} and that's just the discipline of the defense not having backside containment to let that <b>guy</b> <b>out</b> the backdoor.

500|$|Illmatic is also {{credited}} with reviving the Queensbridge rap scene. Once home to prestigious pioneers such as Marley Marl, MC Shan, Roxanne Shanté, Queensbridge {{had been one}} of the most productive hip hop scenes in the country during the 1980s. In an April 2006 article, an XXL columnist wrote of the history and impact of the Queensbridge hip hop scene, stating [...] "Since the 1980s, New York City's Queensbridge Housing Projects has been documented perhaps better than any other geographic location. Starting with super producer Marley Marl's dominant Juice Crew in the ’80s all the way through ’90s mainstays like Nas, Cormega and Capone, the Bridge has produced the highest per-capita talent of any ’hood." [...] Yet during the early 1990s, the Queensbridge rap scene was otherwise stagnant [...] According to Nas: [...] "I was coming from the legacy of Marley Marl, MC Shan, Juice Crew kind of vibe. Knowing these <b>guys</b> <b>out</b> in the neighborhood. At that time, the Queensbridge scene was dead. Dropping that album right there said a lot for me to carry on the legacy of the Queensbridge pioneers." ...|$|E

500|$|Heading {{into the}} {{following}} season, the Blue Demons lacked both leadership and talent at the point guard position. Clinkscales hoped to assume the role as a leader, saying, [...] "I think that's my job. I'm going to do that, regardless 40 minutes or two minutes. I'm {{going to try to}} help the <b>guys</b> <b>out,</b> from the bench or on the court." [...] His development impressed Jerry Wainwright, who became more comfortable with giving him more playing time.

After playing 21 minutes off the bench, he had five points, two assists, two turnovers, and a season-high three steals. Heading into late December, in the midst of multiple injuries to his teammates, Clinkscales began receiving increased playing time and frequently appeared in the Blue Demons' starting lineup. On January 3, 2008, while playing a career-high 39 minutes against Villanova, he scored a season-best 12 points and added eight assists with two turnovers. Clinkscales was effective once again in his team's January 16 rematch with Villanova, as he finished with 11 assists – the most he would record as a senior. Despite his passing efforts, the team was unable to beat the Wildcats, and lost 69–76. Against [...] on February 23, Clinkscales led his team with eight assists and two steals.

Surrounding this fervor, Singh was misquoted as having said that Sörenstam [...] "didn't belong" [...] on the men's tour and that he would not play if he were paired with her.

2500|$|Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican {{associated}} with the Tea Party movement, questioned her repeatedly on a different aspect, whether Ambassador to the UN Rice had misled the public after the attacks.

2500|$|The team's lockout-shortened 50-game 1998–99 season {{included}} a brief {{stint as a}} player by Dennis Rodman, the firing of head coach Harris, and the interim head coaching stint of former Laker player Kurt Rambis. During the lockout, O'Neal, Bryant, Derek Fisher, and Corie Blount played a two-on-two basketball game. Bryant was always a physical player during practice. Other players, though, disliked Bryant's approach to practice. Fisher said, [...] "That was really the way we all should have been playing. With Kobe's spirit." [...] During the game, O'Neal slapped Bryant. Fisher said neither O'Neal nor Bryant really started it, as they were both being physical.

At one point, O'Neal pointed at Bryant and told reporters in the locker room, [...] "There's the problem." [...] Bryant's jerseys were outselling O'Neal's in Southern California sporting goods stores, and rumors started that O'Neal was jealous, as he was with Penny Hardaway when they played together in Orlando.

2500|$|... 2014 {{marked the}} year where Cavernario moved from working {{primarily}} in CMLL's secondary venues in Guadalajara, Jalisco to working full-time in Mexico City, CMLL's most important venues, gaining national exposure. His first major exposure {{on a national}} level was when he was teamed up with veteran wrestler Mr. Niebla for the 2014 Gran Alternativa ("Great Alternative") tournament, a tournament specifically designed to showcase younger wrestlers. Cavernario and Mr. Niebla was successful and won the tournament and the two worked so well together that Cavernario was invited to join Mr. Niebla's group La Peste Negra. Over the summer of 2014 Cavernario was one of 8 wrestlers competing in CMLL's En Busca de un Ídolo ("In search of an idol") tournament, actually ending up winning the entire tournament when he defeated Hechicero in the finals. Later on Cavernario began a rivalry with Rey Cometa as they found themselves on opposite sides of six-man tag team matches where they would single each other out during the matches. On September 5, 2014 the two faced off in a 1-on-1 Lighting match on CMLL's Super Viernes show, a match that ended with the two wrestling to a very intense 10 minute time limit draw. After the match Rey Cometa challenged his opponent to put his hair on the line in a Luchas de Apuestas match, the young Cavernario almost immediately accepted the challenge and the match was booked for the 81st Anniversary Show as the second Apuestas match of the night. The following day CMLL officially announced that Rey Cometa and Cavernario would meet in the 4th match of the show. Prior to this Apuestas match Rey Cometa had competed in four Apuestas matching, only losing one, where he was forced to unmask. Cavernario had competed in a total of five Apuestas matches, like Rey Cometa only losing one, which had forced him to unmask.> The previously injured tecnico Thunder reappeared in CMLL after a 7-month absence during the semi-main event of the September 5 Super Viernes show, coming to the ring during the third fall of a match between the tecnico team of Atlantis, Dragón Rojo, Jr. and Volador Jr. fighting rivals Gran Guerrero, Rey Escorpión and Último Guerrero. Initially he acted like he was helping the good <b>guys</b> <b>out,</b> only to turn on Volador Jr. attacking him during the match. While the act caused the team of the Guerreros and Rey Escorpión to lose by disqualification it became clear that Último Guerrero was ordering Thunder to continue to attack Volador Jr. even after the bell had rung. The intensity of the attack was underlined by Volador Jr. having to be taken from the arena on a stretcher. The following day it was announced that the returning and now rudo Thunder would team up with Mr. Niebla and Euforia in the third match of the night, facing his newfound victim Volador Jr. who would team up with Máscara Dorada and Valiente in what would be the first in ring meeting between these newfound rivals.|$|E
