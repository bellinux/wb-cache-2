5|$|Legislation for a Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar was {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives by Massachusetts' Joseph Walsh on March 23, 1920, with the bill designated as H.R. 13227. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, of which Indiana Congressman Albert Vestal was the chairman. That committee held hearings on the bill on March 26, 1920, {{as well as on the}} coinage proposal that would become the Alabama Centennial half dollar, which was the first order of business. Once the committee voted to favorably recommend the Alabama bill, which provided for 100,000 half dollars, it proceeded to consider the Pilgrim proposal. Vestal had two days previously written to Treasury Secretary David F. Houston, and Houston responded that while his department had not opposed the Maine Centennial (previously approved by the committee) or Alabama coinage bills, the Treasury had concerns that issuing large numbers of different designs would aid <b>fraudsters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dummy {{corporations}} may {{be created}} by <b>fraudsters</b> {{to create the illusion}} of being an existing corporation with a similar name. <b>Fraudsters</b> then sell securities in the dummy corporation by misleading the investor into thinking that they are buying shares in the real corporation.|$|E

50|$|Victims {{are people}} in {{financial}} trouble who believe they are becoming clients of a professional operation. The <b>fraudster</b> promises to make the foreclosures, evictions, repossessions, high interest rates on loans, and other debt problems go away. The victim pays a large initial fee for the <b>fraudster's</b> services, and the <b>fraudster</b> usually has the victim sign blank documents. Sometimes the victim is also told to make their usual payments directly to the fraudulent advisor instead of the real creditors, or to transfer their real estate to the <b>fraudster.</b> The payments are stolen by the <b>fraudster</b> instead of being used to pay victims' debts, and real estate is often deeded in fractional shares to other victims unknowingly under bankruptcy, complicating ownership to make foreclosures even more difficult by having multiple (fraudulent) bankruptcies involved in the property.|$|R

25|$|The Insurance Fraud Bureau in the UK {{estimated}} {{there have}} already been more than 20,000 staged collisions and false insurance claims across the UK from 1999 to 2006. One tactic <b>fraudsters</b> use is to drive to a busy junction or roundabout and brake sharply causing a motorist to drive {{into the back of}} them. They claim the other motorist was at fault because they were driving too fast or too close behind them, and make a false and inflated claim to the motorist's insurer for whiplash and damage which can give the <b>fraudsters</b> up to £30,000. In the Insurance Fraud Bureau's first year or operation, the usage of data mining initiatives exposed insurance fraud networks and led to 74 arrests and a five-to-one return on investment.|$|E
25|$|Recovery {{of assets}} from the {{proceeds}} of securities fraud is a resource intensive and expensive undertaking because of the cleverness of <b>fraudsters</b> in concealment of assets and money laundering, {{as well as the}} tendency of many criminals to be profligate spenders. A victim of securities fraud is usually fortunate to recover any money from the defrauder.|$|E
25|$|Evil twin is a {{phishing}} {{technique that}} is hard to detect. A phisher creates a fake wireless network that looks similar to a legitimate public network that may be found in public places such as airports, hotels or coffee shops.

Policemen carry the <b>fraudster</b> off to trial, but during the mayhem of the court case, he upends his opponents and escapes through a window. A chase ensues before the fake diamond swindler is finally caught and imprisoned.|$|R

25|$|Investment in {{fine wine}} has {{attracted}} {{those who take}} advantage of their victims' relative ignorance of this wine market sector. Such wine <b>fraudsters</b> often profit by charging excessively high prices for off-vintage or lower-status wines from well-known wine regions, while claiming that they are offering a sound investment unaffected by economic cycles. As with any investment, thorough research is essential to making an informed decision.|$|E
25|$|Both indictments {{were related}} to {{achievement}} of personal tax evasion, through illicit trade of movie rights between Mediaset and secret fictive foreign companies situated in tax haven nations, causing fictive losses for Mediaset, with the trade gains being accumulated by the foreign companies owned by the indicted tax <b>fraudsters,</b> who ultimately had the gains paid out as personal profit without paying tax in Italy. In 2007, the court case at first-instance {{had not yet been}} launched, and the prosecutors dropped the (A) charges against Berlusconi due to the statute of limitations, and for the same reason the (B) charges were narrowed down to the 1994–98 period, in which the prosecutor charged Berlusconi for having committed a personal tax evasion of €7.3 million.|$|E

25|$|The {{dissatisfied}} customers {{complained to}} Britain's Office of Fair Trading, which handles consumer protection issues. Officials there {{got in touch}} with their counterparts at the FTC in the U.S. They were able to take action due to the Undertaking Spam, Spyware, And Fraud Enforcement With Enforcers Beyond Borders Act of 2006, commonly known as the SAFE WEB Act, which Congress had passed at the commission's request to help them coordinate actions against Internet <b>fraudsters</b> who operate across international boundaries with similar agencies in other countries, such as OFT. Most relevant to its case against Karnani, the legislation had clarified that the FTC had authority over American companies that did business exclusively with customers abroad. Its action against Karnani and Balls of Kryptonite was the first it had undertaken against one.|$|E
25|$|Device {{fingerprinting}} is {{a fairly}} new technology that is useful in fraud prevention and safeguarding any information from one's computer. Device fingerprinting uses data from the device and browser sessions to determine the risk of conducting business with the person using the device. This technology allows companies to better assess the risks when business is conducted through sites that include, e-commerce sites, social networking and online dating sites and banks and other financial institutions. ThreatMetrix {{is one of the}} leading vendors of device fingerprinting. This company employs a number of techniques to prevent fraud. For example, ThreatMetrix will pierce the proxy to determine the true location of a device. Due to the growing number of hackers and <b>fraudsters</b> using 'botnets' of millions of computers that are being unknowingly controlled, this technology will help not only the companies at risk but the people who are unaware their computers are being used.|$|E
25|$|Government, {{bankruptcy}} and general auctions are amongst {{the most common}} auctions to be found today. A government auction is simply an auction held {{on behalf of a}} government body generally at a general sale. Here one may find a vast range of materials that have to be sold by various government bodies, for example: HM Customs & Excise, the Official Receiver, the Ministry of Defence, local councils and authorities, liquidators, as well as material put up for auction by companies and members of the public. Also in this group you will find auctions ordered by executors who are entering the assets of individuals who have perhaps died in testate (those who have died without leaving a will), or in debt. One of the most interesting bodies to look out for at auction is HM Customs & Excise who may be entering at auction various items seized from smugglers, <b>fraudsters</b> and racketeers.|$|E

25|$|Fraud in wine {{production}} {{refers to the}} use of additives in order to deceive. This may include colouring agents such as elderberry juice, and flavourings such as cinnamon at best, or less desirable additives at worst. Some varieties of wine have sought after characteristics. For example some wines have a deep, dark color and flavor notes of spices due to the presence of various phenolic compounds found in the skin of the grapes. <b>Fraudsters</b> will use additives to artificially create these characteristics when they are lacking. Fraud in the selling of wine, has seen much attention focused on label fraud and the investment wine market. Counterfeit labelling of rare, expensive, and cult wines, and unregulated investment wine firms characterise this type of fraud. Wine Spectator noted as much as 5% of the wine sold in secondary markets could be counterfeit and the DTI (UK) believes losses (by investors) to rogue wine investment firms amount to hundreds of millions of pounds.|$|E
