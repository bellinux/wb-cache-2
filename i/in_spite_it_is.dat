40|$|In Textile production, {{measurement}} of the yarn mass in 1 mm range is utmost importance to properly evaluate the evenness, as several irregularities occur in 1 to 4 mm yarn length. Until present, measurements in 1 mm range are still not directly performed. In this paper we present a direct mass measurement in 1 mm range based on capacitive sensors and signal processing techniques. The results {{point out that the}} evaluation of yarn mass, with this approach, is feasible in the 1 mm range. The new approach allows on-line measurement (1 mm yarn mass) in a spinning frame for real-time control. Several Digital Signal Processing techniques are used to improve the results. A value of capacity variation is close to 2, 08 E- 17 F for a 57 tex (0, 057 g/m) yarn. It is possible, with this equipment, to detect small variations but signal to noise ratio (SNR) is still low. With the current electronic conditioning it is possible to detect these variation <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in microvolt range. As a spin-off the developed sensor is being used in knitting machines to control the yarn break and bobbin end...|$|E

ABSTRACT: The old convent site of MBH located {{related in}} the center of Lisbon city. This place is the nucleus point, from an Urbanistic point of view, of the city and from there we can connect all other regions of Lisbon, meaning from there we can send “Octopus arms” as to Baixa, Bairro Alto, Saldanha, S. Joao, Beato and more. Today this {{important}} location is closed and isolated by a wall. <b>In</b> <b>spite,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in the city center and we are passing through it frequently, almost nobody is going there or passing through this place, just as a middle age fortress. We don’t even pay attention on how uncomfortable and damaged this isolated and closed location surrounded by walls does to Lisbon city by opening her “borders” and becoming big modern integrative metropole. Another problem we are dealing with is the entrance to Miguel Bombard area, climbing there through all the small streets until the entrance is an interesting experience for us. But the main and “only” entrance is from the south part of the convent, which keeps the other parts of the city isolated without any access to north or east. In fact, we do have other two accesses but they are not active, one is from the East side, R. Gomes Freire, have stairs inside the wall, which with R. Donna Estefania is important junction to {{the right side of the}} hills, means right side from Av. Liberdade. Probably this Gog and Magog war is important to create new order for better world, new borders, new and better priorities as Ecological problem we have to solve before we have no earth to fight for, or Global warming, science and education. New society which each one follow his own belief while others respect him and let him live according to his belief, when no one is trying to force you or brainwash others to follow him in the name of God or any other idea. A society when following your religious is something you do on your extra time, kind of a hobby and not the main reason of living and life. Having the 3 majority religious under one roof can be a good starting point to avoid Gog and Magog war, it will an opportunity to see what others are doing and at the end to see that we are all care and want and wish for the same things and values. We all want being respected, to love and be loved, to live with dignity, to bring food to our family and more and above all to see that we all pray to the same “God” to the same idea and sharing the same belief and hope. According to Urbanism point of view, we need to find a solution how to open the walls, to create an access to MB inside and outside, how to integrate MB which located in the city center with other part of city and make it growing and wanted and popular area for citizens, to making them want to pass by, visit, living in MB site and surround it to make it an organic integrate location or even I might say new vibrant neighborhood in Lisbon between the 2 main hills but on the other hand in the existences building to keep the tradition and the history but will transfer it functional living area by doing residential dormitories for students from all over the world, Bio food market, to keep the tradition and the beauty of MB as historical and architectural part of the city. The project should integrate between the old and new part of Lisbon. Such a project could be the beginning of SOHO of Lisbon, The nucleus point of the city. When we are checking the radius of the area in relative to the all-city we can city how central it is. I want the Project to be “outside the wall” by preserve the convent morphology, the existence buildings and the walls but on the other hand open it to public, to make it direct path with other parts of the city. International religious center will bring new people to the area from all over the world. There will be research department, events, conferences and the area will open their walls, gates, to the citizens of Portugal. N/...|$|E
