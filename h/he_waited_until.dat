5|$|Following the Rangers' defeat, he {{announced}} his retirement from the NHL on 4 May 2009, {{at the age of}} 35. Näslund had informed Rangers general manager Glen Sather, head coach John Tortorella, and his teammates of his intention to retire prior to the team's playoff elimination. By announcing his retirement early in the off-season, Näslund forfeited a $2million buyout from the Rangers, which would have counted against the team's salary cap for the following season had <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> he was formally bought out. Näslund retired from the NHL second among all-time Swedish players with 395 goals (behind Mats Sundin's 564; he retired the same year). His 869 points ranked fifth, while his 1,117 games played ranked fourth.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the time}} at which Yousef left Jersey City, {{questions}} linger as to why <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> noon to attack. Author Simon Reeve theorized that something went wrong, such as Yousef encountering too much security, and the target was changed to be the World Trade Center.|$|E

25|$|The Liberals {{lost the}} 1886 election, and Asquith joined the House of Commons as an {{opposition}} backbencher. <b>He</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> March 1887 {{to make his}} maiden speech, which opposed the Conservative administration's proposal to give special priority to an Irish Crimes Bill. From {{the start of his}} parliamentary career Asquith impressed other MPs with his air of authority as well as his lucidity of expression. For the remainder of this Parliament, which lasted until 1892, Asquith spoke occasionally but effectively, mostly on Irish matters.|$|E
25|$|When {{the serpent}} fled, {{part of its}} body {{made it into the}} {{underwater}} tunnel. It blocked the passage, and the water began to rise. Xwechtáal passed out, and when he awoke, he was on top of a mountain and the water was everywhere. <b>He</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> the water receded, then climbed down the mountain. Following the mountain to the lake, he found the old corpse of the serpent, but it was just bones. Xwechtáal then took one of the vertebrae of the serpent and acquired magical supernatural powers with it.|$|E

25|$|Garin {{became a}} {{professional}} by chance. He planned {{to ride a}} race at Avesnes-sur-Helpes, 25km from where he lived. He arrived to find it was only for professionals. Not allowed to compete, <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> the riders had left, raced after them and passed them all. He fell off twice but finished ahead of the racers. The crowd was enthusiastic but the organisers less so. They refused to pay him the 150 francs (approx €525 at 2008 values) due to the real winner, so spectators raised 300 francs (approx €1,050 at 2008 values) among themselves. Garin became a professional.|$|E
25|$|At his death, Lord Jellicoe was the longest-serving {{member of}} the House of Lords, and arguably the longest-serving {{parliament}}arian in the world, having succeeded his father on 20 November 1935 and come of age and sat first in parliament on 25 July 1939. Because <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> 28 July 1958 to make his maiden speech, a few peers (viz. Earl Ferrers and Lords Renton, Carrington, Healey, and Strabolgi) could have been considered to have been active parliamentarians longer. Moreover, {{at the time of}} his death, on the Privy Council only the Duke of Edinburgh (1951) and Lords Carrington (1959), Deedes and Renton (both 1962) had served longer.|$|E
25|$|When {{elected by}} the legislature, Clay was below the constitutionally {{required}} age of thirty. His age {{did not appear to}} have been noticed by any other Senator, and perhaps not by Clay. His term ended before his thirtieth birthday. Such an age qualification issue has occurred with only two other U.S. Senators, Armistead Thomson Mason (aged 28 in 1816), and John Eaton (aged 28 in 1818). Such an occurrence, however, has not been repeated since. In 1934, Rush D. Holt, Sr. was elected to the Senate at the age of 29; <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> he turned 30 (on the following June 19) to take the oath of office. In November 1972, Joe Biden was elected to the Senate at the age of 29, but he reached his 30th birthday before the swearing-in ceremony for incoming senators in January 1973.|$|E

25|$|The Senate (not the judiciary) is {{the sole}} judge of a senator's {{qualifications}}. During its early years, however, the Senate did not closely scrutinize the qualifications of its members. As a result, three senators who {{failed to meet the}} age requirement were nevertheless admitted to the Senate: Henry Clay (aged 29 in 1806), Armistead Thomson Mason (aged 28 in 1816), and John Eaton (aged 28 in 1818). Such an occurrence, however, has not been repeated since. In 1934, Rush D.

25|$|In {{another example}} of the fierce, close fighting, a single soldier was {{responsible}} for disabling several tanks during a 24-hour period. On the evening of 17 December in nearby Rocherath, Pfc William A. Soderman of Company K, 9th Infantry, 2nd Infantry Division, heard enemy tanks approaching his position in the early evening. Armed with a bazooka, <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> five Panthers were within pointblank range. He stood up in the road and fired a rocket into the lead tank, setting it on fire. The other tanks passed him by, but the next morning he repeated his actions. When five more German tanks approached, he jumped onto the road in front of the tanks and disabled the lead tank. The remaining tanks were unable to bypass the lead tank and withdrew. Soderman was severely wounded and received the Medal of Honor for his actions.|$|E
25|$|Layton did {{not seek}} {{election}} to the House of Commons by running in a by-election, as is the tradition among new party leaders without a seat. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> the 2004 federal election to contest the riding of Toronto—Danforth against Liberal Dennis Mills. With no seat in the House of Commons, he appointed the runner-up, longtime Winnipeg-area MP Bill Blaikie, as parliamentary leader. Although he had no parliamentary seat, Layton was noted for drawing considerable attention from the Canadian mass media. Much of his rhetoric involved attacking the policies of then Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin as conservative, and arguing {{the ideology of the}} Liberal Party of Canada had shifted in a more right wing direction. Another focus of Layton's leadership was to focus the party's efforts on Quebec, one of the party's weaker provinces. One of his opponents in the leadership race, Pierre Ducasse, was the first Québécois to run for leader of the NDP. After the race, Layton appointed Ducasse as his Quebec lieutenant and party spokesperson.|$|E

25|$|When the Pakistani {{invasion}} of Kashmir began in September 1947, Patel immediately {{wanted to send}} troops into Kashmir. But, agreeing with Nehru and Mountbatten, <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> Kashmir's monarch had acceded to India. Patel then oversaw India's military operations to secure Srinagar and the Baramulla Pass, and the forces retrieved much territory from the invaders. Patel, along with Defence Minister Baldev Singh, administered the entire military effort, arranging for troops {{from different parts of}} India to be rushed to Kashmir and for a major military road connecting Srinagar to Pathankot to be built in six months. Patel strongly advised Nehru against going for arbitration to the United Nations, insisting that Pakistan had been wrong to support the invasion and the accession to India was valid. He did not want foreign interference in a bilateral affair. Patel opposed the release of Rs.550million to the Government of Pakistan, convinced that the money would go to finance the war against India in Kashmir. The Cabinet had approved his point but it was reversed when Gandhi, who feared an intensifying rivalry and further communal violence, went on a fast-unto-death to obtain the release. Patel, though not estranged from Gandhi, was deeply hurt at the rejection of his counsel and a Cabinet decision.|$|E
25|$|Parker {{places a}} hidden {{microphone}} {{in the interview}} room where Will Thoday and his sailor brother Jim are waiting. It becomes apparent that each brother thought the other was guilty of killing Deacon, but each {{was willing to take}} the blame himself or at least shield the other. When they are interviewed, Will relates that he encountered Deacon, who had come to retrieve the emeralds, in the church on 30 December. Will had married Mary after the war, believing her a widow. Now he realised Deacon was still alive, making his and Mary's marriage bigamous and their daughters illegitimate. Desperate to prevent Deacon from exposing his family to pain and scandal, Will tied him up in the bell-chamber, planning to bribe him to leave, but became helpless with Spanish influenza next day. Will's delirious talk led Jim to find Deacon's body in the bell-chamber on 2 January. He assumed that Will had murdered him. Appalled but loyal, <b>he</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> the night after Lady Thorpe's funeral on 4 January, made the body unrecognisable and hid it in the new grave, then left for sea. When the body was discovered, Will assumed Jim had killed Deacon. Neither can explain how Deacon died. Both are released. Will marries Mary again in Bloomsbury and they return to Fenchurch St. Paul.|$|E
