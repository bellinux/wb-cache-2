5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. <b>His</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> tied behind his back, and a rope was tied {{from his hands}} to a post in the ground. A large fire was lit {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at Michigan, Walker was paid by the White Sewing Machine Company of Cleveland to play for their semi-professional ball club in August 1881. Walker's {{presence}} was controversial when the team arrived for a game in Louisville, Kentucky, {{the first place to}} have a major issue with his race. As the team arrived in the early morning of the game, Walker was turned away from the Saint Cloud Hotel. More issues arose during game time: members of the Louisville Eclipse protested Walker's participation; Cleveland relented and held him out of the lineup. After one inning, his substitute claimed <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> too badly bruised to continue, and Walker hesitantly walked on to the field for warm-ups. Louisville again protested and refused to resume play until Cleveland's third baseman volunteered to go behind the plate.|$|E
5|$|Katy and Shell {{explore and}} enter Hector's bedroom, where {{they find a}} circle of salt around the bed. They hear the bell again and trace the sound to Andras's room. When Katy opens the bed's curtains, Andras's {{deformed}} body is revealed; he {{is tied to the}} bed and gagged. Katy goes to untie him, believing that Hector and Tabitha have kept him prisoner. Shell asks how Andras could have rung the bell if <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> tied. Hector and Tabitha appear and show that it is they who rang the bell. They quote Dante's Inferno and explain that Hell is cold, as the text says, so the house must be kept refrigerated for Andras. They say he was possessed at age ten by Castiel, demon of mischief, but Castiel needs a new human host every fifty years, and Andras is now dying. Katy was chosen as the next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector's church recommended her to them. It is revealed that Shell also attends the church, and she helped them to lure Katy. Shell implies that the church's members protect the earth from being overrun by demons.|$|E

25|$|The {{mother of}} the Imun-dong murder victim rushed at Yoo with an {{umbrella}} when he {{was brought to the}} Prosecutor's office later in July, screaming that her daughter would still be alive if the police had captured him earlier.

25|$|Wolfgang was {{complaining}} of his eyes. I noticed {{his head was}} warm, that his cheeks were hot and very red, but that <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> cold as ice.

Wong claimed that <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> faster acting than Lee's, however Bruce retaliated by saying his kicks were much faster, thus provoking the friendly scuffle. Wan commented that Lee's kicks were fast and powerful whilst Wong's wing chun hand techniques were modified and practical. Wong and Lee only fought {{for a short period}} of time.|$|E
25|$|Set {{to become}} an {{unrestricted}} free agent on July 1, 2009, Rypien re-signed to a two-year deal with the Canucks on May 27. Rypien continued {{to play on the}} Canucks' fourth line in 2009–10. During a game against the St. Louis Blues on December 31, 2009, he was automatically ejected after a fight with opponent Cam Janssen revealed <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> illegally taped below the wrist to support a sprained finger. Avoiding major injury {{for the first time in}} his NHL career, he recorded career-highs of 8 points (4 goals and 4 assists) in 69 games.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{two months}} later, on March 4, two men {{gathering}} brush near Fredericksburg discovered the decomposing body of Carroll Jackson in a ditch. He {{had been shot}} in the back of the head. <b>His</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> also tied behind his back. Upon recovering the body, police discovered that Carroll had been dumped over that of eighteen-month-old Janet Jackson; it was later determined that the child had been dumped alive in the ditch before her father, and had suffocated under the weight of his body. On March 21, the bodies of Mildred and Susan Jackson were discovered in a forest near Annapolis, showing signs of torture and pre-mortem sexual assault.|$|E
25|$|Rivière quickly {{passed the}} blame for his fall and his broken back on the team {{mechanic}}, accusing him of leaving oil on the wheels and the brakes for not working. The mechanic was outraged, and the doctors soon found the real reason – that so much painkiller was in Rivière's blood that <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> too slow to operate the brakes. He had taken {{a heavy dose of}} the opioid painkiller dextromoramide (Palfium), to help him stay with Nencini on Col de Perjuret. Rivière later admitted to being a drug addict, telling a newspaper how he had doped to beat the world hour record, and admitted downing thousands of tablets a year.|$|E
25|$|Dexter when {{he arrived}} began at once to turn the green field into a cloth of gold...He took chances - thank {{goodness}} for those who look on batting as a challenge! - but he made superb strokes, with his driving tremendous in power and placement. Sometimes, in fact, the placement didn't matter so much because the power sent the ball through men recognized as outstanding fielders. Once such stroke, a cover-drive, was through Thomas's legs just as he got his hands there. I felt glad that the ball went between his legs and that <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> not behind it. Not even Jehu drove more furiously than Dexter, and a direct hit on the leg or hands might well have put this accomplished fieldsman out of action.|$|E

25|$|Johnny O'Keefe {{enjoyed the}} drive. In {{the early hours}} of 27 June 1960, O'Keefe, Johnny Greenan and Greenan's wife Janice were driving back to Sydney from the Queensland Gold Coast. About 20 {{kilometres}} north of Kempsey, the Plymouth ploughed into a gravel truck. While the front of the large car bore the brunt of the very severe impact, all three were seriously injured. O'Keefe's face was smashed and Johnny Greenan was thrown out of the car, landing six metres away on the highway, causing a fractured vertebra and loss of front teeth; Janice Greenan suffered a severe concussion. O'Keefe suffered multiple lacerations, a concussion and fractures to his head and face; he lost four teeth, and <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> also badly lacerated.|$|E
25|$|Dexter's power amazed {{everyone}} {{who had not}} had the joy of watching him in other innings in England and in Perth. He took chances – thank goodness for those who look on batting as a challenge! – but he made superb strokes, with his driving tremendous in power and placement. Sometimes, in fact, the placement didn't matter so much because the power sent the ball through men recognized as outstanding fielders. Once such stroke, a cover-drive, was through Thomas's legs just as he got his hands there. I felt glad that the ball went between his legs and that <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> not behind it.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{carelessness}} and neglect were severely punished, {{as in the}} case of the unskillful physician, if it led to loss of life or limb, <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> cut off; a slave had to be replaced, the loss of his eye paid for by half his value; a veterinary surgeon who caused the death of an ox or donkey paid quarter value; a builder whose careless workmanship caused death lost his life or paid for it by the death of his child, replaced slave or goods and in any case, had to rebuild the house or make good any damages due to defective building and repair the defect as well. The boat builder had to make good any defect of construction or damage due to it for a year's warranty.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt {{was able}} to {{convince}} many people {{that he was getting}} better, which he believed was essential if he was to run for public office again. In private he used a wheelchair, but was careful not to be seen in it in public, although he sometimes appeared on crutches. He usually appeared in public standing upright, while being supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons. For major speaking occasions, an especially solid lectern was placed on the stage so that he could support himself on it; as a result, in films of his speeches Roosevelt can be observed using his head to make gestures, because <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> gripping the lectern. He might raise one hand to gesture, but his other hand held the lectern.|$|E
25|$|After the conquest, king Leovigild reintroduced the Arian Church {{among the}} Sueves, {{but this was}} a {{short-lived}} institution, because after his death in 586 his son Reccared openly promoted the mass conversion of Visigoths and Sueves to Catholicism. Reccared's plans were contested and confronted by a group of Arian conspirators; its leader, Segga, was sent into exile to Galicia, after <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> amputated. The conversion culminated during the Third Council of Toledo, which counted with the assistance of seventy-two bishops from Hispania, Gaul and Galicia. There 8 bishops abjured of their Arianism, among them four Suevi: Beccila of Lugo, Gardingus of Tui, Argiovittus of Porto, and Sunnila of Viseu. The mass conversion was celebrated by king Reccared: “Not only the conversion of the Goths is found among the favours that we have received, but also the infinite multitude of the Sueves, whom with divine assistance we have subjected to our realm. Although led into heresy by external fault, with our diligence we have brought them to the origins of truth”. He was styled as “King of the Visigoths and of the Suevi” in a letter sent to him by Pope Gregory the Great soon after.|$|E
25|$|Cheap Imitation {{became the}} last work Cage {{performed}} in public himself. Arthritis had troubled Cage since 1960, {{and by the}} early 1970s <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> painfully swollen and rendered him unable to perform. Nevertheless, he still played Cheap Imitation during the 1970s, before finally having to give up performing. Preparing manuscripts also became difficult: before, published versions of pieces were done in Cage's calligraphic script; now, manuscripts for publication had {{to be completed by}} assistants. Matters were complicated further by David Tudor's departure from performing, which happened in early 1970s. Tudor decided to concentrate on composition instead, and so Cage, {{for the first time in}} two decades, had to start relying on commissions from other performers, and their respective abilities. Such performers included Grete Sultan, Paul Zukofsky, Margaret Leng Tan, and many others. Aside from music, Cage continued writing books of prose and poetry (mesostics). M was first published by Wesleyan University Press in 1973. In January 1978 Cage was invited by Kathan Brown of Crown Point Press to engage in printmaking, and Cage would go on to produce series of prints every year until his death; these, together with some late watercolors, constitute the largest portion of his extant visual art. In 1979 Cage's Empty Words was first published by Wesleyan University Press.|$|E
