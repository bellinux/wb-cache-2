40|$|Both {{exploitation}} of Natural resources {{and activities of}} multinational corporations in developing countries have independently been subjects of vehement discussions surrounding the oil or in a wider sense raw material crisis emerging from the embargo of OPEC countries in 1973 and those on the New International Economic Order. This paper examines in this background the role of <b>foreign</b> <b>private</b> <b>investments</b> in the natural resources of developing countries {{in the light of}} their current policies. But compared with traditional definition of natural resources, they are conceived here more broadly. They include besides (1) minerals., energy sources, forests, etc., also (2) air, rivers, oceans, sun energy, climate and other environmental constituents which determine nature's absorptive capacity for industrial growth and pollution. Natural resources of the first group are called here non-renewable or exhaustive and those of the second group environmental resources. The dividing line between the two groups may, however, be in some cases very thin because all natural resources are subject to exhaustion, albeit to different degrees, and all of them are parts of environment. Nevertheless, a distinction between exhaustive and environmental resources is drawn in this paper in order to account for their varying importance for <b>foreign</b> <b>private</b> <b>investments</b> in developing countries and in this sense our definitions of the two groups of natural resources are purely subjective. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{primarily}} designed {{to examine the}} nature of the relationship existing between stock market development and the level of investment flows in a country with a high degree of macroeconomic instability; and whether the stock market plays a uniform role in attracting both domestic and foreign investments in such economic situation. Extrpoloted macroeconomic quarterly data (over a period from 1970 to 2006) are used in the analysis. The Johansen Cointegration model is adopted to examine the long-run trends in the variables. While controlling for other variables, a vector error correction model (VERCM) is used in estimating the relationship between investment growth, on one hand, and stock market development on the other. The study shows that development in the Nigerian stock market over the years was able to spur growth in domestic <b>private</b> <b>investment</b> flows, but unable to do so in the case of <b>foreign</b> <b>private</b> investment; and that development in the country’s banking system rather had some distabilising effects on the flow of <b>private</b> <b>investments.</b> The researchers attributed this to persistent cases of distress and failure in the banking system.

We use four governance measures (voice and accountability, regulatory quality, political stability and control of corruption) to distinguish between ‘market-friendly' (favourable) and ‘market-unfriendly' (unfavourable) regimes. The results suggest that <b>private</b> <b>investment</b> has a greater effect on total investment than FDI in unfavourable regimes whereas both are of similar importance in favourable regimes.
