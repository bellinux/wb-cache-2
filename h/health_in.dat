40|$|This article {{begins with}} {{a brief history of}} the {{emergence}} of health psychology, discussing the nature of heath psychology, and the crisis <b>in</b> <b>health</b> that drives the need for more health psychologists. It then proceeds to discuss training <b>in</b> <b>health</b> psychology <b>in</b> Australia at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. To provide a context for considering ways forward, the history of training <b>in</b> <b>health</b> psychology <b>in</b> Australia is reviewed, followed by an examination of equivalent training overseas. Reviewing these literatures revealed that in Australia only five universities offer a compulsory stand-alone course <b>in</b> <b>health</b> psychology <b>in</b> the first 3 years of the undergraduate degree. As many as 11 Australian universities have offered postgraduate training <b>in</b> <b>health</b> psychology, but this number has fallen to only three universities currently. Recommended goals and strategies for increasing postgraduate training <b>in</b> <b>health</b> psychology are offered related to (a) increasing demand from applicants for postgraduate programmes <b>in</b> <b>health</b> psychology; (b) increasing employment opportunities for <b>health</b> psychologists <b>in</b> the public and private sectors; (c) increasing government funding for postgraduate professional programmes; (d) development of alternative training options; and (e) increasing attractiveness of existing training options.

5|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did {{not have}} any specific legislation in the field of mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the USSR Ministry of <b>Health.</b> <b>In</b> the Soviet Union, any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman, relatives or instructions of a district psychiatrist. In this case, patient's consent or dissent mattered nothing. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the psychiatrist. All of that made the abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed the political regime, and that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights of the mentally ill.|$|E
