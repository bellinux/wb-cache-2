The nine tower floors were only accessible via the ground level, from the dorm's primary entrance hall. An exterior <b>fire</b> <b>escape</b> led down the back of Jewett's tower but was replaced with an interior stairwell during the 2003 renovation.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the {{purpose-built}} tenements in New York {{were not}} slums, {{although they were}} not pleasant to be inside, especially in hot weather, so people congregated outside, made heavy use of the <b>fire</b> <b>escapes,</b> and slept in summer on <b>fire</b> <b>escapes,</b> roofs, and sidewalks.|$|R
50|$|Patrons {{who were}} able to escape via the {{emergency}} exits on the north side found themselves on the unfinished <b>fire</b> <b>escapes.</b> Many jumped or fell from the icy, narrow <b>fire</b> <b>escapes</b> to their deaths; the bodies of the first jumpers broke the falls of those who followed them.|$|R

5|$|In several countries, {{fire safety}} {{officials}} encourage citizens {{to use the}} two annual clock shifts as reminders to replace batteries in smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, particularly in autumn, just before the heating and candle season causes an increase in home fires. Similar twice-yearly tasks include reviewing and practicing <b>fire</b> <b>escape</b> and family disaster plans, inspecting vehicle lights, checking storage areas for hazardous materials, reprogramming thermostats, and seasonal vaccinations. Locations without DST can instead use {{the first days of}} spring and autumn as reminders.|$|E

Level 9 houses the distinctive circular Council Chamber, which features wood panelling {{and has been}} restored to largely its original state in the 1990s refurbishment (by contrast {{to most of the}} other levels of the building). The building is almost completely clad with glass, which led to criticism about its excessive air conditioning costs.

In the poorer areas of cities like Chicago and New York, <b>fire</b> <b>escapes</b> were commonly used for everything but their intended purpose.|$|R

When everyone arrives on the roof, Ciara meets up with Chamillionaire for his verse, and thereafter Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, the stars of Step Up, make appearances in dance sequences.
