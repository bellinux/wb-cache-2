40|$|Abstract—This paper shows {{a simple}} and {{effective}} approach to the design and implementation of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Systems</b> (IIS) oriented to control the characteristics of each individual product manufactured in a production line and also their manufacturing conditions. The particular products considered in this work are large steel strips that are coiled just after their manufacturing. However, the approach is directly applicable to coiled strips in other industries, like paper, textile, aluminum, etc. These IIS provide very detailed information of each manufactured product, which complement the general information managed by the ERP system of the production line. In spite of the high importance {{of this type of}} IIS to guarantee and improve the quality of the products manufactured in many industries, there are very few works about them in the technical literature. For this reason, this paper represents an important contribution to the development of this type of IIS, providing guidelines for their design, implementation and exploitation.

Examples of such technologies are the browsers, search engines, related communication protocols and their implementations, mechanisms for creating dynamic and active Web sites, security mechanisms, etc. These technologies lead to requirements for substantial changes in the methodologies for development and deployment of all systems and subsystems, which constitute any business process. Changes and/or new decisions are necessary to make possible the modern Web-based technological tools to be used effectively for Web-based business processes. A methodology for developing business software components as basic building elements of industrial information systems, implemented and deployed in Web-based computing environment is proposed and discussed in this paper. The methodology is based on the idea of creating a unified framework for representing business activities as a basis for business process modeling. Respective models, methods and techniques ensure the business objects and components to applied to currently most accepted three-tier Web application architecture using XML document as distributed object.

30|$|Instruments (i.e. sensors) stream {{continuous}} measurements (e.g. room temperature) [22 – 24] to {{programmable logic}} controllers (PLC). PLC’s are digital computers that are programmed with logic to automate the production process. This logic is programmed by automation engineers to evaluate each instruments measurement and initiate appropriate actions based on their state. Measurements transmitted to PLC’s are persisted in memory at set intervals (e.g. every 15  min) as tuples of timestamp/value. This format is common in <b>industrial</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> and {{is referred to as}} time-series, measured, or temporal data. Subsequently, time-series data persisted in PLC memory is transferred to an archive in batch (e.g. every 24  h), with the archive typically taking the form of a relational database or flat log file.
