50|$|The first {{application}} of soil nailing was implemented in 1972 for a railroad widening project near Versailles, France. Soil nails {{were used to}} stabilize an 18 m high slope consisting of sandy soil. This method {{proved to be more}} cost-effective, {{while at the same time}} cut down the construction time when compared to other conventional support methods. Germany was the next country to investigate soil nailing. From 1975 to 1981 the University of Karlsruhe and the construction company Bauer collaborated to establish a research program. This program conducted full scale testing of experimental walls with different configurations and developed analysis procedures for use in design. The United States first used soil nailing in 1976 for the support of a 13.7 m deep <b>foundation</b> <b>excavation</b> in dense silty sands. Soil nailing was implemented in the expansion of The Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon. This retaining system was produced in approximately half the time at about 85% of the cost of conventional retaining systems.|$|E

50|$|The viaduct was a 13 arch structure, 305 yd long, {{with the}} rail level {{reaching}} 120 ft high.

The river <b>foundation</b> <b>excavations</b> were complicated by large oak trees found embedded in the river, which required divers for manual removal. Piers 5,7,8 and 9 had triple foundations, connected above the water level by two semicircular arches.

50|$|Fish weir {{discovery}} {{continued in}} 1939, with archeological investigations led by Frederick Johnson during <b>foundation</b> <b>excavation</b> for the New England Mutual Life Building at 501 Boylston Street. Long sequences of wooden stakes, buried under tidal silt {{and an additional}} 15 to 20 ft of 19th-century Back Bay fill, were found passing through the site and continuing on under surrounding streets. Maps were drawn that described a fish weir covering more than 2 acre of the former marshland below Boston's Back Bay - suggesting the existence of one very large fish weir with over 65,000 wooden stakes. The imagined scale of this fish weir led scholars to speculate that it was built at one time by a community of appreciable size. This fish weir was described as the earliest known large-scale engineering effort in North America. Drawings and models were made {{based on the findings}} and show the fish weir built in deep water, maintained by men working from mishoons (log canoes). This interpretation may have been informed by the type of fish weirs known to be still in use in the 1940s by Native peoples in the Canadian Bay of Fundy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper takes {{example of}} a {{foundation}} pit in Haikou, analyzing the influence on the surrounding buildings {{in the course of}} the excavation depth, daily rainfall, foundation form of the building and other factors. The results show that the excavation depth and strong rainfall may lead large deformation of the surrounding buildings, and the deep foundation pit has obvious effect on surrounding building with shallow foundation. Therefore, those factors should be considered adequately in the design and construction of deep foundation pit. Overview of Influence of <b>Foundation</b> Pit <b>Excavation</b> on Surrounding Buildings The <b>excavation</b> of deep <b>foundation</b> pit is equal to the surrounding soil uploading, which will cause the soil around the foundation pit extending gravity deformation in the direction of pit, and produce additional internal forces and deformation, and even heavy deformation and damages of buildings.

40|$|AbstractA {{protective}} layer (PL) is commonly reserved above foundation surface {{to protect the}} underlying rock mass during dam <b>foundation</b> <b>excavation.</b> In China, the PL of dam foundation is conventionally subdivided into two or three thin layers and excavated with the shallow-hole blasting method, even by pneumatic pick method in case of soft rock mass. The aforementioned layered excavation of the PL delays {{the construction of the}} whole project. After nearly 30 -year practices, several safe and efficient methods for the PL excavation of dam foundation are gradually developed. They include shallow-hole bench blasting with cushion material (SBC) {{at the bottom of the}} hole, and horizontal smooth blasting (HSB). The PL is even cancelled on the condition that horizontal pre-split technique is employed during dam <b>foundation</b> <b>excavation.</b> This paper introduces the aforementioned two PL excavation methods (shallow-hole blasting and bench blasting) and horizontal pre-split technique of dam foundation without {{protective layer}} (HPP). The basic principles of blasting method, blasting geometry, charge structure, drill-and-blast parameters of typical projects are examined. Meanwhile, the merits and limitations of each method are compared. Engineering practices in China show that HSB is basically the optimal method for dam foundation PL excavation in terms of foundation damage control and rapid construction. Some new problems for dam foundation PL excavation arising, such as strong unloading and relaxation phenomenon that encountered in the gorge region of southwest China, are needed to be addressed; and the corresponding countermeasures are discussed as well...|$|E

Through ratings and comparisons of relevant factors, a rating method for different design plans is proposed based on AHP analysis. Several supporting plans for a practical excavation engineering in Kunming are analyzed and compared through above method and a reasonable and optimized design plan is selected...|$|E
