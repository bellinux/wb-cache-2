One {{component}} {{is a red}} dwarf star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> does indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually is as it appears to be too small to be a black hole.|$|E

The eastern Pacific basin extends from {{all areas of the}} Pacific north of the equator east of 140°W, while the central Pacific basin includes areas north of the equator between 140°W and 180°W. Both basins extend to the Arctic Circle at 66°N.

5|$|On June8, a {{tropical}} wave exited {{the west coast}} of Africa, moving quickly westward without development. During the evening hours of June15, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a large area of disturbed weather in association with {{a tropical}} wave over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. That day, a low pressure area developed just north of Panama. Drifting west-northwest, environmental conditions were expected to be favorable for organization, but the system moved over eastern Nicaragua on June16. Despite moving over land, the circulation and convection became better organized, and after it emerged over open waters, the system developed into Tropical Depression Two at 1200UTC on June17 about 25mi (45km) north-northwest of La Ceiba, Honduras. Located about 60mi (95km) east of Monkey River Town, Belize, the depression was not expected to undergo significant strengthening. Failing to intensify, the depression made landfall in southern Belize near Big Creek late on June17 with winds estimated at 35mph (55km/h). Despite a waning structure, the NHC noted that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> emerged into the Bay of Campeche, re-development and intensification was plausible.|$|E
