30|$|Oil {{price has}} a {{significant}} <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NPV because of two factors. Firstly, the oil price has a direct influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> total revenue of the project, and is {{a key factor in}} determining annual cash flows. Secondly, oil price is volatile, and has a great contribution to the variance of NPV. OOIP also has a great influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NPV, and its <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NPV {{is similar to that of}} oil price. However, its <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> annual cash flow is transmitted by the production curve, and not as direct as oil price, thus, its <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NPV is smaller than oil price’s. Opex per barrel also influences the NPV. But as its value is small and the variation range is narrow, its <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> annual cash flow is not large. Consequently, its <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NPV is relatively weak.|$|R

5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound {{to a second}} window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E

5|$|As Kujira {{began to}} track towards Taiwan, the Taiwanese {{government}} issued land- and sea-based warnings {{in advance of}} the storm. The local weather bureau specifically alerted vessels off the southern and southeastern coasts of the island. Continued strengthening of Kujira prompted the Central Weather Bureau to issue medium typhoon warnings for several portions of Taiwan, though these warnings were downgraded to light typhoon status following the subsequent weakening of the typhoon on April22. This made Kujira the first April typhoon to prompt the issuance of any cyclone-related warnings in Taiwan since 1978. <b>Impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island were expected to be limited to rainfall, though the forecasted precipitation was also expected to lessen ongoing drought conditions. However, mudslides were also a potential impact from the typhoon. The National Fire Administration and Taiwan Power Company developed a contingency plan for the typhoon and had also undertaken other precautionary measures. Airports on Orchid Island and Green Island were closed. The resultant rainfall from Kujira's outer rainbands would be some of the most significant for the island in several months.|$|E
5|$|Extraterrestrial {{technology}} could have profound <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{nature of human}} culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet {{for a wide variety}} of political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent. Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology. He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the Industrial Revolution, which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order. Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Odile is {{tied for}} the most intense landfalling {{tropical}} cyclone on the Baja California Peninsula during the satellite era. Sweeping across the peninsula in September2014, Odile inflicted widespread damage, particularly {{in the state of}} Baja California Sur, in addition to causing lesser <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Mexican mainland and Southwestern United States. The precursor to Odile developed into a tropical depression south of Mexico on September10 and quickly reached tropical storm strength. After meandering for several days, Odile began to track northwestward, intensifying to hurricane status before rapidly reaching its Category4 hurricane peak intensity on September14. The cyclone slightly weakened before making landfall near Cabo San Lucas with winds of 125mph (205km/h). Odile gradually weakened as it tracked across the length of the Baja California Peninsula, briefly crossing into the Gulf of California before degenerating into a remnant system on September17. These remnants tracked northeastward across the Southwestern United States before they were no longer identifiable on September19.|$|E
5|$|Other human <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{atmosphere}} {{include the}} {{air pollution in}} cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to have been about 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E

Inaccessible Island was once suggested as a site for agriculture for Tristan Islanders, which would have reduced habitat and risked the introduction of invasive species.

Access to the island is restricted now, although Tristan Islanders are still permitted to visit the island to collect firewood and guano. Introduced New Zealand flax {{has been removed from}} the island, and the island now has a management plan. Other suggestions for securing this species' future include increased education on biosecurity for the local community, and potentially setting up a captive population. It has also been suggested that backup populations be established on other secure islands, for example Nightingale Island, in case predators reached Inaccessible Island, but this may have negative <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> endemic invertebrate faunas of these islands.|$|E
