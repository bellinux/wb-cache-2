In rare instances, some defendants are prosecuted both federally and by the state for the same drug trafficking conduct.

25|$|History of responsa in Judaism spans {{a period}} of 1,700 years. Rabbinic responsa {{constitute}} a special class of rabbinic literature, differing in form, but not necessarily in content, from Rabbinic commentaries devoted to the exegesis of the Bible, the Mishnah, the Talmud, and halakha (the codes of Jewish religious law). The codes themselves contain the rules for ordinary incidents of life. The responsa literature covers all these topics and more.Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography: Responsal literature {{as a whole has}} as yet found no literary historian; single periods have been discussed while others have been entirely neglected, the works on these separate epochs including: Joel Müller, Briefe und Responsen aus der Vorgaonäischen Jüdischen Literatur, Berlin, 1886; idem, Einleitung in die Responsen der Babylonischen Geonen. ib. 1891; Zecharias Frankel, Entwurf einer Geschichte der Literatur der Nachtalmudischen Responsen, Breslau, 1865. The responsa by European and American rabbis to problems arising <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>are</b> summarized by J. D. Eisenstein, The Development of Jewish Casuistic Literature in America, Baltimore, 1905. The mode, style and subject matter have changed {{as a function of the}} travels of the Jewish people and of the development of other halakhic literature, particularly the codes. Forumulation of responsa, or she'elot ve-t'shuvot, which literally translates to questions and answers, generally involve an individual or group asking either teachers, rabbis, or heads of yeshivot about halakhah (Jewish law) and the party responding via an exchange of letters. Responsa literature spans 1700 years and there are even responsa being developed based on questions posed today. The development of responsa literature can be divided into four periods: the Tannaitic Period, the Geonic Period, the First Rabbinic Epoch,the Second Rabbinic Epoch, the Third Rabbinic Epoch, and the Fourth Rabbinic Epoch.|$|E

[...] Richard Pryor's approval helped retain the segment in the film. The studio became more enthusiastic about the film when Reitman showed executives and sales managers of various regions in the country a 10-minute production reel that was put together in two days. The reaction was positive and the studio sent 20 copies out to exhibitors. The first preview screening for Animal House was held in Denver four months before it opened nationwide.

500|$|In the 1980s, Arabians {{became a}} popular status symbol and were marketed {{similarly}} to fine art. Some individuals also used horses {{as a tax}} shelter. Prices skyrocketed, especially in the United States, with a record-setting public auction price for a mare named NH Love Potion, who sold for $2.55million in 1984, and the largest syndication in history for an Arabian stallion, Padron, at $11,000,000. The potential for profit led to over-breeding of the Arabian. When the Tax Reform Act of 1986 closed the tax-sheltering [...] "passive investment" [...] loophole, limiting the use of horse farms as tax shelters, the Arabian market was particularly vulnerable due to over-saturation and artificially inflated prices, and it collapsed, forcing many breeders into bankruptcy and sending many purebred Arabians to slaughter. Prices recovered slowly, with many breeders moving away from producing [...] "living art" [...] and towards a horse more suitable for amateur owners and many riding disciplines. By 2003, a survey found that 67% of purebred Arabian horses <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>are</b> owned for recreational riding purposes. , {{there are more than}} 660,000 Arabians that have been registered in the United States, and the US has the largest number of Arabians of any nation in the world.|$|E
