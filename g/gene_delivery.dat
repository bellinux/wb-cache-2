25|$|One {{important}} factor in <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> is developing altered cell tropisms to narrow or broaden rAAV-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> and to increase its efficiency in tissues. Specific properties like capsid conformation, cell targeting strategies can determine which cell types are affected and also {{the efficiency of the}} gene transfer process. Different kinds of modification can be undertaken. For example, modification by chemical, immunological or genetic changes that enables the AAV2 capsid to interact with specific cell surface molecules.|$|E
25|$|Although AAV2 is {{the most}} popular {{serotype}} in various AAV-based research, {{it has been shown that}} other serotypes can be more effective as <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> vectors.

In the brain, most AAV serotypes show neuronal tropism, while AAV5 also transduces astrocytes. AAV6, a hybrid of AAV1 and AAV2, also shows lower immunogenicity than AAV2.|$|E

25|$|Various vectors {{have been}} {{developed}} to carry the therapeutic genes to cells. There are two broad categories of <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> vectors: Viral vectors, involving viruses and non-viral agents, such as polymers and liposomes.|$|E
25|$|It is well {{established}} that the macromolecular structure of nonviral <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> vectors alters their transfection efficacy and cytotoxicity. The cyclized structure has been proven to reduce cytotoxicity and increase circulation time for drug and <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> applications. The unique structure of cyclizing chains provides the single chain cyclized polymers a different method of interaction between the polymer and plasmid DNA, and results in a general trend of higher transfection capabilities than branched polymers. Moreover, {{due to the nature}} of the single chain structure, this cyclized polymer can “untie” to a linear chain under reducing conditions. Transfection profiles on astrocytes comparing 25 kDa-PEI, SuperFect® and Lipofectamine®2000 and cyclized polymer showed greater efficiency and cell viability whilst maintaining neural cell viability above 80% four days post transfections.|$|E

2500|$|While viral vectors are 40% more {{efficient}} in transferring genes, {{they are not}} fully appreciated for in vivo <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> because of their further adverse effects. Primarily, viral vectors induce an inflammatory response, which can cause minor side effects such as mild edema or serious ones like multisystem organ failure. It is also difficult to administer gene therapy repeatedly due to the immune system's enhanced response to viruses. Furthermore, viruses may spread out to other organs after intraarticular injection {{and this will be}} an important disadvantage. [...] However, majority of problems associated with <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> using viral vectors solved by ex vivo <b>gene</b> <b>delivery</b> method.

2500|$|Alphaviruses are of {{interest}} to gene therapy researchers, in particular the Ross River virus, Sindbis virus, Semliki Forest virus, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus have all been used to develop viral vectors for <b>gene</b> <b>delivery.</b> Of particular interest are the chimeric viruses that may be formed with alphaviral envelopes and retroviral capsids. Such chimeras are termed pseudotyped viruses. [...] Alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses are able to integrate the genes that they carry into the expansive range of potential host cells that are recognized and infected by the alphaviral envelope proteins E2 and E1. The stable integration of viral genes is mediated by the retroviral interiors of these vectors. There are limitations {{to the use of}} alphaviruses in the field of gene therapy due to their lack of targeting, however, through the introduction of variable antibody domains in a non-conserved loop in the structure of E2, specific populations of cells have been targeted. Furthermore, the use of whole alphaviruses for gene therapy is of limited efficacy both because several internal alphaviral proteins are involved in the induction of apoptosis upon infection and also because the alphaviral capsid mediates only the transient introduction of mRNA into host cells. Neither of these limitations extend to alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses. However, the expression of Sindbis virus envelopes may lead to apoptosis, and their introduction into host cells upon infection by Sindbis virus envelope pseudotyped retroviruses may also lead to cell death. [...] The toxicity of Sindbis viral envelopes may be the cause of the very low production titers realized from packaging cells constructed to produce Sindbis pseudotypes. Another branch of research involving alphaviruses is in vaccination. Alphaviruses are apt to be engineered to create replicon vectors which efficiently induce humoral and T-cell immune responses. They could therefore be used to vaccinate against viral, bacterial, protozoan, and tumor antigens.|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} use of metallic expandable intravascular stents {{has resulted in}} improved therapeutic outcomes for coronary artery disease. However, arterial reobstruction after stenting, in-stent restenosis, remains an important problem. Gene therapy to treat in-stent restenosis by using <b>gene</b> vector <b>delivery</b> from the metallic stent surfaces has never been demonstrated. The present studies investigated the hypothesis that metal–bisphosphonate binding can enable site-specific <b>gene</b> vector <b>delivery</b> from metal surfaces. Polyallylamine bisphosphonate (PAA-BP) was synthesized by using Michael addition methodology. Exposure to aqueous solutions of PAA-BP resulted {{in the formation of}} a monomolecular bisphosphonate layer on metal alloy surfaces (steel, nitinol, and cobalt–chromium), as demonstrated by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Surface-bound PAA-BP enabled adenoviral (Ad) tethering due to covalent thiol-binding of either anti-Ad antibody or a recombinant Ad-receptor protein, D 1. In arterial smooth muscle cell cultures, alloy samples configured with surface-tethered Ad were demonstrated to achieve site-specific transduction with a reporter gene, (GFP). Rat carotid stent angioplasties using metal stents exposed to aqueous PAA-BP and derivatized with anti-knob antibody or D 1 resulted in extensive localized Ad-GFP expression in the arterial wall. In a separate study with a model therapeutic vector, Ad-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) attached to the bisphosphonate-treated metal stent surface via D 1, significant inhibition of restenosis was demonstrated (neointimal/media ratio 1. 68 ± 0. 27 and 3. 4 ± 0. 35; Ad-iNOS vs. control, P < 0. 01).

The optimal conditions for <b>gene</b> gun-based <b>delivery</b> of gold particles into the epidermal layer of the skin were determined. After delivery of the gold particles, an inflammatory response was observed. This response occurred regardless of the presence of plasmid and therefore was a result of the physical disturbance of the skin by the gold particles. To identify transfected cells, a plasmid expressing a green fluorescent protein was delivered into the skin. Fluorescent cells were located primarily in the outermost layers of the epidermis and outside the core of gold particles deposited by the gene gun. Cattle were immunized by gene gun with a plasmid expressing a truncated, secreted form of bovine herpesvirus- 1 glycoprotein D.
