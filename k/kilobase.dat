5|$|Variola {{is a large}} brick-shaped virus {{measuring}} approximately 302 to 350 nanometers by 244 to 270nm, with {{a single}} linear double stranded DNA genome 186 <b>kilobase</b> pairs (kbp) in size and containing a hairpin loop at each end. The two classic varieties of smallpox are variola major and variola minor.|$|E
25|$|Glycophorin C and D encode the Gerbich (Ge) antigens. There {{are four}} alleles, Ge-1 to Ge-4. Three types of Ge antigen negativity are known: Ge-1,-2,-3 (Leach phenotype), Ge-2,-3 and Ge-2,+3. A 3.4 <b>kilobase</b> pair {{deletion}} within the gene, which probably arose because of {{unequal crossing over}} between the two repeated domains, {{is responsible for the}} formation of the Ge-2,-3 genotype. The breakpoints of the deletion are located within introns 2 and 3 and results in the deletion of exon 3. This mutant gene is transcribed as a messenger RNA with a continuous open reading frame extending over 300 nucleotides and is translated into the sialoglycoprotein found on Ge-2,-3 red cells. A second 3.4 <b>kilobase</b> pair deletion within the glycophorin C gene eliminates only exon 2 by a similar mechanism and generates the mutant gene encoding for the abnormal glycoprotein found on Ge-2,+3 erythrocytes.|$|E
25|$|Glycophorin C (GPC) is {{a single}} {{polypeptide}} chain of 128 amino acids and is encoded by a gene on the long arm of chromosome 2 (2q14-q21). The gene was first cloned in 1989 by High et al. The GPC gene is organized in four exons distributed over 13.5 <b>kilobase</b> pairs of DNA. Exon 1 encodes residues 1-16, exon 2 residues 17-35, exon 3 residues 36-63 and exon 4 residues 64-128. Exons 2 and 3 are highly homologous, with less than 5% nucleotide divergence. These exons also differ by a 9 amino acid insert at the 3' end of exon 3. The direct repeated segments containing these exons is 3.4 <b>kilobase</b> pairs long and may be derived from a recent duplication of a single ancestral domain. Exons 1, 2 and most of exon 3 encode the N-terminal extracellular domain while the remainder of exon 3 and exon 4 encode transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.|$|E
50|$|Pacific Biosciences commercialized SMRT {{sequencing}} in 2011, after {{releasing a}} beta {{version of its}} instrument in late 2010. At commercialization read length had a normal distribution {{with a mean of}} about 1.1 <b>kilobases.</b> A new chemistry kit released in early 2012 increased the sequencer's read length; an early customer of the chemistry cited mean read lengths of 2.5 to 2.9 <b>kilobases.</b> The XL chemistry kit released in late 2012 increased average read length to more than 4.3 <b>kilobases.</b> The P4 binding kit released in August 2013 combined with the XL chemistry kit yielded average read lengths to more than 5 <b>kilobases</b> and when coupled with input DNA size selection (using an electrophoresis instrument such as BluePippin) yields average read length over 7 <b>kilobases.</b>|$|R
50|$|The genomes in {{this group}} vary {{considerably}} from ~10 <b>kilobases</b> to over 2.5 megabases in length. The largest bacteriophage known is Klebsiella Phage vB_KleM-RaK2 which has a genome of 346 <b>kilobases.</b>|$|R
50|$|The genome {{has three}} {{segments}} L (6.8 kilbases), M (4.2 <b>kilobases)</b> and S (1.5 <b>kilobases).</b> It encodes five proteins—the polymerase on the L segment, the p12G and the Gc-Gn protein on the M segment and the N and p12 proteins in the S segmement.|$|R
25|$|The AAV genome {{is built}} of {{single-stranded}} deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA), either positive- or negative-sensed, {{which is about}} 4.7 <b>kilobase</b> long. The genome comprises inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) {{at both ends of}} the DNA strand, and two open reading frames (ORFs): rep and cap. The former is composed of four overlapping genes encoding Rep proteins required for the AAV life cycle, and the latter contains overlapping nucleotide sequences of capsid proteins: VP1, VP2 and VP3, which interact together to form a capsid of an icosahedral symmetry.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{the virus}} does present some disadvantages. The cloning {{capacity}} of the vector is relatively limited and most therapeutic genes require the complete replacement {{of the virus}}'s 4.8 <b>kilobase</b> genome. Large genes are, therefore, not suitable {{for use in a}} standard AAV vector. Options are currently being explored to overcome the limited coding capacity. The AAV ITRs of two genomes can anneal to form head to tail concatamers, almost doubling the capacity of the vector. Insertion of splice sites allows for the removal of the ITRs from the transcript.|$|E
25|$|Kelavkar and Badr (1999) {{stated that}} the ALOX15 gene maps to 17p13.3 in close {{proximity}} to the tumor-suppressor gene TP53 (191170). In humans, it is encoded by the ALOX15 gene located on chromosome 17p13.3. This 11 <b>kilobase</b> pair gene consists of 14 exons and 13 introns coding for a 75 kiloDalton protein composed of 662 amino acids. 15-LO is to be distinguished from another human 15-lipoxygenase enzyme, ALOX15B (also termed 15-lipoxygenase-2). Orthologs of ALOX15, termed Alox15, are widely distributed in animal and plant species but commonly have different enzyme activities and make somewhat different products than ALOX15.|$|E

40|$|Viral DNA in {{simian virus}} 40 -transformed mouse cells {{is capable of}} rearranging with passage. In this report, we show that such {{rearrangement}} can include an alteration in viral protein expression. SVT 2, a simian virus 40 -transformed mouse BALB/c 3 T 3 cell line, synthesizes only a super T antigen of molecular weight 100, 000 without synthesizing the lytic-size large T or small t antigens with molecular weights of 94, 000 and 17, 000, respectively. Analyses of the integrated viral DNA revealed an early region of 4. 4 <b>kilobases</b> instead of the lytic-size 2. 7 <b>kilobases.</b> However, upon subcloning in either plastic or agarose or after being in culture for several passages, the appearance of lytic-size large T and small t antigens was detected.

25|$|In CAPP-Seq, {{design of}} {{selector}} {{is a crucial}} step that identifies recurrent mutations in a particular cancer type using publicly available next generation sequencing data. For inclusion in CAPP-seq selector, the recurrent mutations that are enriched in a population is described by an index- Recurrence Index (RI). RI {{is the number of}} mutations per <b>kilobase</b> of a given genomic locus of a patient carrying particular mutations. RI represents a patient level recurrence frequency estimated for somatic mutations and all mutations. Known and driver recurrent mutations in a population can be ranked based on the RI and therefore RI is used to design a selector. A six phase design strategy is employed to design selector.|$|E
25|$|Massively Parallel Sequencing is a newer {{method that}} can be used to detect mutations. Using this method, up to 17 gigabases can be sequenced at once, as opposed to limited ranges for Sanger {{sequencing}} of only about 1 <b>kilobase.</b> Several technologies are available to perform this test and it is being looked at to be used in clinical applications. When testing for different carcinomas, current methods only allow for looking at one gene at a time. Massively Parallel Sequencing can test for a variety of cancer causing mutations at once as opposed to several specific tests. An experiment to determine the accuracy of this newer sequencing method tested for 21 genes and had no false positive calls for frameshift mutations.|$|E
25|$|Each plastid creates {{multiple}} {{copies of}} a circular 75–250 <b>kilobase</b> plastome. The number of genome copies per plastid is variable, ranging from more than 1000 in rapidly dividing cells, which, in general, contain few plastids, to 100 or fewer in mature cells, where plastid divisions {{have given rise to}} a large number of plastids. The plastome contains about 100 genes encoding ribosomal and transfer ribonucleic acids (rRNAs and tRNAs) as well as proteins involved in photosynthesis and plastid gene transcription and translation. However, these proteins only represent {{a small fraction of the}} total protein set-up necessary to build and maintain the structure and function of a particular type of plastid. Plant nuclear genes encode the vast majority of plastid proteins, and the expression of plastid genes and nuclear genes is tightly co-regulated to coordinate proper development of plastids in relation to cell differentiation.|$|E
40|$|As part of {{our efforts}} to {{understand}} factors influencing chromosomal organization and rearrangements, we studied a family of Salmonella typhimurium tandum duplication mutants. We found that the duplications were originally generated by unequal recombination between pairs of similarly oriented ribosomal ribonucleic acid operons (rrn). This demonstration involved the physical isolation of the duplicated material as circular deoxyribonucleic acid excised from the duplication. The four rrn operons involved embraced the ilv pur D segment of the chromosome and occurred at positions closely analogous to those previously observed for Escherichia coli. The interval between rrnC and rrnA of S. typhimurium was similar in size to that of E. coli (43 versus 39 <b>kilobases),</b> as was the interval between rrnB and rrnE (94 versus 91 <b>kilobases).</b> The rrnA-to-rrnB interval of S. typhimurium, however, was 155 <b>kilobases,</b> substantially greater than the 126 <b>kilobases</b> observed for E. coli...|$|R

25|$|The gene has 97% {{sequence}} homology with the glycophorin A gene from the 5' UTR approximately 1 <b>kilobase</b> upstream from the exon encoding the transmembrane regions to {{the portion of}} the coding sequence encoding the first 45 amino acids. There is a signal sequence of 19 amino acid residues. The leader peptide differs by one amino acid and the next 26 amino acids are identical. Amino acids 27-55 of glycophorin A are absent from glycophorin B. This section includes an N-glycosylation site. Only O-glycosylation sites are found on glycoprotein B and these are linked via serine or threonine. Residues 80-100 of glycophorin A and 51-71 of glycophorin B are very similar. The intervening residues in contrast differ significantly. The antigenic determinant for the blood group Ss is located at residue 29 where S has a methionine and s a threonine. This is due to a mutation at nucleotide 143 (C->T). The S antigen is also known as MSN3 and the s antigen as MNS4.|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} cloned EcoRI {{fragments}} of the human CMV (HCMV) genome, strain AD 169, to prepare restriction endonuclease maps of the DNA. Individual 32 P-labeled cloned fragments were hybridized to Southern blots of HCMV DNA cleaved to completion with the restriction endonucleases BglII and HindIII and cleaved partially with EcoRI. By determining which EcoRI fragments hybridized to the same band on a Southern blot, {{we were able to}} establish linkage groups. This information coupled with the data derived from digestion of the cloned fragments with the enzymes BglII and HindIII (Tamashiro et al., J. Virol. 42 : 547 - 557, 1982) provided the basis for the construction of detailed maps for the enzymes EcoRI, BglII, and HindIII. We also identified the EcoRI fragments derived from the termini of this genome and mapped them with respect to the BglII and HindIII terminal fragments. From our mapping data, we conclude that the genome of HCMV is approximately 240 <b>kilobases</b> in length and is divided into long (198 <b>kilobases)</b> and short (42 <b>kilobases)</b> regions. Both regions consist of a unique sequence bounded by inverted repeats (11 to 12 <b>kilobases</b> for the long region and 2 to 3 <b>kilobases</b> for the short region).
