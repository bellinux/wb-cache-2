40|$|Caenorhabditis elegans is {{suitable}} for studying the nervous system, which controls behavior. C. elegans shows sinusoidal locomotion on an agar plate. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> moves not only sinusoidally but also more complexly, which reflects regulation of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> muscles by <b>the</b> nervous system. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> movement becomes more irregular with senescence. To date, <b>the</b> <b>head</b> movement complexity has not been quantitatively analyzed. We propose two simple methods for evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> movement regularity on an agar plate using image analysis. The methods calculate metrics that are {{a measure of how}} <b>the</b> <b>head</b> end movement is correlated with body movement. In the first method, the length along the trace of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> end on <b>the</b> agar plate between adjacent intersecting points of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> trace and <b>the</b> quasi-midline of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> trace, which was made by sliding an averaging window of 1 / 2 the body wavelength, was obtained. Histograms of the lengths showed periodic movement of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and deviation from it. In the second method, the intersections between the trace of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> end and <b>the</b> trace of the 5 (near the pharynx) or 50 % (the mid-body) point from <b>the</b> <b>head</b> end in <b>the</b> centerline length of the worm image were marked. The length of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> trace between adjacent intersections was measured, and a histogram of the lengths was produced. The histogram for the 5 % point showed deviation of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> end movement from the movement near the pharynx. The histogram for the 50 % point showed deviation of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> movement from <b>the</b> sinusoidal movement of the body center. Application of these methods to wild type and several mutant strains enabled evaluation of their head movement periodicity and irregularity, and revealed a difference in <b>the</b> age-dependence of <b>head</b> movement irregularity between the strains. A set of five parameters obtained from the histograms reliably identifies differences in head movement between strains...|$|R
