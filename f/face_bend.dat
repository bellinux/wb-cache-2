40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} effect of bolt gauge on the <b>face</b> <b>bending</b> {{behaviour}} of concrete-filled Square Hollow Sections (SHS) in Hollo-Bolted connections. A set of full-scale experiments were undertaken {{to examine the effects}} of varying the bolt gauge on the SHS <b>face</b> <b>bending</b> behaviour while controlling all other parameters. Typical experiment involved one row of two bolts pulled out of concrete-filled SHS. A special dummy bolts were manufactured to the exact size and geometry of open Hollo-Bolts, and were used in the experiments to remove the influence of any deformation associated with the real Hollo-Bolts, and isolate the <b>face</b> <b>bending</b> behaviour. Non-contact video-based equipment was used to record the SHS face deformation. This deformation is recorded as force-displacement relationship which is commonly used to represent the structural behaviour of similar components, and typically defined by initial stiffness, yield force and post yield stiffness. Across the range considered in this investigation, it was found that varying the bolt gauge to SHS width ratio have a significant effect on the concrete-filled SHS <b>face</b> in <b>bending</b> component. Both the initial stiffness and the yield force of the component were found to increase with the increase of the bolt gauge. The Post-Yield stiffness was not affected by the change in bolt gauge...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{experimental}} {{testing and}} numerical analysis {{were used to}} investigate the effect of tube thickness on the <b>face</b> <b>bending</b> for concrete filled hollow sections connected to other structural members using Extended Hollobolts. Six samples were tested experimentally by applying pull-out load on the bolts. These samples were designed to fail by column <b>face</b> <b>bending.</b> The main variable in all tests is the column face thickness. Finite element analyses were also performed using ABAQUS 6. 11 to extend the experimental results and to quantify the effect of column face thickness. Results show that, the column face thickness has a clear impact on the connection strength and stiffness. However, the amount of improvement in the connection stiffness by changing the column face thickness from 5 mm to 6. 3 mm seems {{to be higher than}} that when increasing it from 6. 3 mm to 8 mm. The displacement at which the bolts start pulling-out from their holes increased with the use of thinner column face due to the high flexibility of the section. At the ultimate strength, the yielding of the column face propagated to the column corner and there was no yielding in its walls. After the ultimate resistance is reached, the propagation of the yielding was mainly in the column face with a miner yielding in the walls.

40|$|Structural Hollow Sections have {{superior}} structural performance over open {{sections and}} are currently available as circular, elliptical or rectangular sections. However, the practical {{use of these}} sections is limited due to complexities involved in their connections. The {{lack of access to}} the interior of the section makes it almost impossible to use standard bolted connections. The so-called Blind Bolts are therefore used as fasteners to alleviate these complexities by allowing for bolted rather than, the-not-so-popular, welded connections to hollow sections. Lindapter’s Hollo-Bolt is one of the Blind Bolts used for hollow sections connections. However its established use is currently restricted to transferring tensile forces and vertical shear only. Filling Square Hollow Sections (SHS) with concrete, when utilising Hollo-Bolts, was found to improve the connections’ performance in resisting moments, but there is currently no guidance available for the design of such connections. Many methods are used to model connections behaviour. The so-called component method has emerged to be the most favourite and has been adopted in the Eurocode 3. In this method, the connection is divided into basic components. Each component has a contribution to the structural behaviour of the connection. For Hollo-Bolted moment resisting connections, the behaviour of two of the components, fastener in tension and concrete-filled SHS <b>face</b> in <b>bending,</b> are not available. The application of the component method is therefore not possible. This research aims to devise a model to predict the behaviour of the concrete-filled SHS <b>face</b> in <b>bending.</b> A novel analytical model of the concrete-filled SHS <b>face</b> <b>bending</b> has been proposed in this work. The model has three parts: Initial Stiffness, Yield Force and Post-Yield Stiffness. The Initial Stiffness was formulated by theoretically substituting the face of the concrete-filled SHS with a beam element. The beam is assumed to be loaded by a rigid strip and fixed at its ends. Yield line analysis was used to investigate possible failure mechanisms and associated strengths. The model adopted the mechanism which theoretically led to the critical yield force. The Post-Yield Stiffness was taken {{as a percentage of the}} Initial Stiffness in line with other work from the literature. An extensive full-scale experimental programme was undertaken to calibrate the aforementioned analytical model, and to examine the effects of varying parameters on the SHS <b>face</b> <b>bending</b> behaviour. Typical experiments involved one row of two bolts pulled out of concrete-filled SHS. A special dummy bolts were manufactured to the exact size and geometry of open Hollo-Bolts, and were used in the experimental programme to remove the influence of any deformation associated with the real Hollo-Bolts, and thus isolate the <b>face</b> <b>bending</b> behaviour. Non-contact video-based equipment was used to record the SHS face deformation. Three parameters were varied: the SHS face slenderness ratio, the bolts gauge to SHS width ratio and the concrete in-fill compressive strength. A finite element model was also developed to complement the experimental programme. The model was developed using the ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) to allow for easy parametric analysis and knowledge transfer. Dimensions, parameters and materials properties could be easily altered in the fully parametric model script. The outcomes of the experimental programme and the finite element model were used to formulate design charts for two calibration factors: kis for the calculation of Initial Stiffness, kyf for the calculation of Yield Force. A chart was also formulated for the Post-Yield stiffness ratio. The proposed analytical model (semi-analytical after calibration) was compared with the results of experimental programme and finite element modelling. The model was found to capture the behaviour of concrete-filled SHS <b>face</b> <b>bending</b> with sufficient accuracy, lying between 90...|$|R

40|$|Evolution by mean {{curvature}} is recently attracting large attention {{especially when the}} underlying anisotropic structure degenerates to become crystalline. In such situation new phenomena {{must be taken into}} account: the evolution law becomes nonlocal and "hyperbolic" across facets; moreover events like <b>face</b> breaking or <b>bending</b> have to be considered especially in three dimensions. For this reason the ODE approach suggested by J. Taylor long ago cannot be used directly and the required modifications to the algorithm are not clear at the moment. The well known diffused interface approximation for the classical {{mean curvature}} flow, which leads to the Allen-Cahn equation, can be applied in this contex, resulting in a bistable reaction-diffusion equation with good convergence properties to the sharp interface evolution. This equation can then be discretized using finite elements in space and forward differences in time. Numerical simulations with the resulting scheme seem to recover the face breaking and <b>face</b> <b>bending</b> phenomena...|$|R
