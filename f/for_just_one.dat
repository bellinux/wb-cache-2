5|$|The {{film was}} {{completed}} in 1981, but Paramount was hesitant to release the film out of continuing concerns that the film would be misconstrued. Though {{no one from the}} organization had viewed the completed film, the NAACP threatened boycotts.

It was finally released in the US at five Detroit theatres on November 12, 1982 <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> week, with no trailer, no poster and no promotion at all. It did no business and was shelved as uncommercial by Paramount. Dumbfounded and hurt by the film's shelving, Fuller moved to France, and never directed another American film.|$|E
5|$|During Spring Training {{before the}} 2017 season, the final {{guaranteed}} year on Molina's contract, the Cardinals began {{to negotiate a}} contract extension that would attempt to keep Molina in St. Louis {{for the remainder of}} his career. He agreed to a three-year contract extension for a reported $60 million, making him the highest-paid catcher in baseball. He wasn't interested in exercising his 2018 mutual option, which would have been worth $15 million. The extension assures Molina of remaining in St. Louis through 2020, and increases the chances that he will finish his career having played <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> organization, the one that drafted him. This distinction of having Molina retire as a Cardinal is something that carried weight for both parties throughout the negotiations.|$|E

5|$|In England's reply, captain Alastair Cook {{played in}} a fashion {{reminiscent}} of the man he had replaced for the tour, Strauss, as he played an accumulatory innings to score 64. Kieswetter, who had been brought into the team to provide firepower {{at the start of}} the innings was outscored by Cook 4 to 1, and was nearly dismissed twice in his first over, offering an edge to wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim, and two balls later he was caught in front, but umpire Rod Tucker ruled that he was not out. Kieswetter was dismissed in the 13th over for 19, completely missing a drive; presenting Mushfiqur with an easy stumping. An over later, Kevin Pietersen fell <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> run, leaving England on 74/2. Cook and new man Collingwood put on 22 runs before the opener was adjudged leg before wicket (LBW) though replays indicated that the ball was missing the stumps on the leg side. Collingwood then anchored the chase with Eoin Morgan, the pair adding 88 runs to the score. After the dismissal of Morgan on 33, it was left to Prior to join Collingwood to add the required runs, and England won with four overs to spare.|$|E
5|$|Nelson F.C. is an English semi-professional {{association}} {{football club}} {{based in the}} town of Nelson, Lancashire. Founded in 1881, the club played friendly matches for its first eight years, before becoming one of the founder members of the Lancashire League in 1889. The team won the Lancashire League title in 1896, but disbanded in late 1898 and was suspended by the Lancashire Football Association following incidents involving fans at an FA Cup defeat at Southport Central. Nelson was accepted back into the Lancashire League the following season and in 1901, they joined the Lancashire Combination. Between 1915 and 1918, the team ceased play for the First World War. When competitive football restarted in England in 1919, they joined the Central League. Two seasons later, the club was invited {{to be one of the}} founder teams of the Football League Third Division North. They won the league in 1923, gaining promotion to the Football League Second Division. However, they stayed there <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> season, finishing second-bottom of the league and being relegated back to the Third Division.|$|E

They eat a single mouthful of food on the day after the dark new moon night, increase their food intake by an extra mouthful each day as the size of the moon increases, and reach the maximum fifteen mouthfuls of food for the day after full moon night. Thereafter, they decrease their food intake by a mouthful each day until they reach the new moon night and begin the cycle again with one mouthful the following day.|$|E

In 1949–50 Lowe Hamil were champions of this league, becoming the first (and to date only) team to win the title without losing a single match (some sources state this title win occurred in 1950–51). In 1951 the team switched to the Manchester League, adopting the name Leek Town at the same time, and won the championship at the first attempt, after which the team relocated once more to the Mid-Cheshire League, where again they played <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> season. In 1954 the team joined the Birmingham & District League but resigned {{in the middle of}} the 1956–57 season due to financial difficulties, after which they had another brief spell in the Manchester League, which was also curtailed due to monetary problems, before eventually returning to the Staffordshire County League.|$|E

5|$|Resuming their advance, the Australians were {{supported}} by three squadrons of Corsairs from the Royal New Zealand Air Force—Nos. 14, 22 and 26 Squadrons—which bombed and strafed {{the ground in front}} of the advancing infantry, as well as a creeping barrage of artillery and mortar fire. With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the Hongorai, <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> man wounded. Further progress was made over the next week, but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun, mines and other improvised explosive devices. After this, the 15th Brigade's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour, to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines. The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also. To negate the effectiveness of the Australian tanks, the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads, forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support. Additionally, the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry, which they kept under constant observation and fire.|$|E
