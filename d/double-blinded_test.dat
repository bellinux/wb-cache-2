40|$|BACKGROUND: Individuals with {{idiopathic}} environmental illness with attribution to {{electromagnetic fields}} (IEI-EMF) believe they suffer negative health effects {{when exposed to}} electromagnetic fields from everyday objects such as mobile phone base stations. OBJECTIVES: This study used both open provocation and <b>double-blind</b> <b>tests</b> to determine if sensitive and control individuals experience more negative health effects when exposed to base station-like signals compared with sham. METHODS: Fifty-six self-reported sensitive and 120 control participants were tested in an open provocation test. Of these, 12 sensitive and 6 controls withdrew after the first session. The remainder completed a series of <b>double-blind</b> <b>tests.</b> Subjective measures of well-being and symptoms as well as physiological measures of blood volume pulse, heart rate, and skin conductance were obtained. RESULTS: During the open provocation, sensitive individuals reported lower levels of well-being in both the global system for mobile communication (GSM) and universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) compared with sham exposure, whereas controls reported more symptoms during the UMTS exposure. During <b>double-blind</b> <b>tests</b> the GSM signal {{did not have any}} effect on either group. Sensitive participants did report elevated levels of arousal during the UMTS condition, whereas the number or severity of symptoms experienced did not increase. Physiological measures did not differ across the three exposure conditions for either group. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to a typical GSM base station-like signal did not affect wellbeing or physiological functions in sensitive or control individuals. Sensitive individuals reported elevated levels of arousal when exposed to a UMTS signal. Further analysis, however, indicated that this difference was likely to be due to the effect of order of exposure rather than the exposure itself...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{provocation}} {{experiments with}} persons reporting electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) have been criticised because EHS persons {{were obliged to}} travel to study locations (seen as stressful), {{and that they were}} unable to select the type of signal they reported reacting to. In our study we used mobile exposure units that allow double-blind exposure conditions with personalised exposure settings (signal type, strength, duration) at home. Our aim was to evaluate whether subjects were able to identify exposure conditions, and to assess if providing feedback on personal test results altered the level of self-reported EHS. METHODS: We used double-blind randomised controlled exposure testing with questionnaires at baseline, immediately before and after testing, and at two and four months post testing. Participants were eligible if they reported sensing either radiofrequency or extremely low frequency fields within minutes of exposure. Participants were visited at home or another location where they felt comfortable to undergo <b>testing.</b> Before <b>double-blind</b> <b>testing,</b> we verified together with participants in an unblinded exposure session that the exposure settings were selected were ones that the participant responded to. <b>Double-blind</b> <b>testing</b> consisted of a series of 10 exposure and sham exposures in random sequence, feedback on test results was provided directly after testing. RESULTS: 42 persons participated, mean age was 55 years (range 29 - 78), 76 % were women. During <b>double-blind</b> <b>testing,</b> no participant was able to correctly identify when they were being exposed better than chance. There were no statistically significant differences in the self-reported level of EHS at follow-up compared to baseline, but during follow-up participants reported reduced certainty in reacting within minutes to exposure and reported significantly fewer symptoms compared to baseline. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a subgroup of persons exist who profit from participation in a personalised testing procedure...|$|R
