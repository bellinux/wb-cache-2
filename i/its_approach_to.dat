5|$|For an {{operation}} of the size and complexity of Frequent Wind, casualties were relatively light. Marine corporals McMahon and Judge killed at the DAO compound were the only members of US forces killed in action during the operation {{and they were the}} last US ground casualties in Vietnam. A Marine AH-1J SeaCobra ran out of fuel while searching for the USS Okinawa and ditched at sea, the two crew members were rescued by a boat from USS Kirk. A CH-46F Swift 1-4 of HMM-164 from the USS Hancock flown by Captain William C. Nystul and First Lieutenant Michael J. Shea crashed into the sea on <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the ship after having flown a night sea and air rescue mission (SAR). The two enlisted crew members survived, but the bodies of the pilots were not recovered. The cause of the crash was never determined.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Emily in 1993 caused record {{flooding}} in the Outer Banks of North Carolina while remaining just offshore. The fifth named storm {{and the first}} and strongest hurricane of the year's hurricane season, Emily developed from a tropical wave northeast of the Lesser Antilles on August22. It moved northwestward and strengthened into a tropical storm on August25, after becoming nearly stationary southeast of Bermuda. Emily then curved to the southwest but quickly resumed its northwest trajectory while strengthening into a hurricane. Late on August31, the hurricane reached peak winds of 115mph (185km/h) on <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> North Carolina. Although part of the eye passed over Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks, its absolute center remained 23mi (37km/h) offshore. Gradually weakening, the hurricane swerved away from the coast toward the northeast and later east. Emily stalled again, this time northeast of Bermuda, and dissipated on September6 to the southeast of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|I-75 takes a {{more direct}} route between Indian River and Mackinaw City. M-27 follows old US27 through Topinabee and Cheboygan. With US23 it is a scenic, if indirect, {{alternative}} to I-75 on <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the Mackinac Bridge. M-27 runs along the western shore of Mullett Lake and forms {{the main street of}} Topinabee. The highway intersects M-33 near the confluence of the Cheboygan and Black rivers. North of the M-33 junction, M-27 runs parallel to the Cheboygan River on the west river bank into downtown Cheboygan.|$|E

5|$|Persona began {{development}} {{after the release}} of Shin Megami Tensei If..., with the idea of creating a subseries around the positively received high school setting of If.... Multiple staff members from previous Megami Tensei titles were involved in development, including character designer Kazuma Kaneko, and director Kouji Okada. Multiple aspects of the story, including Personas and the character Philemon, were taken from Jungian psychology, while Kaneko's character designs were based on both staff members, and celebrities and fictional characters of the time. Reception to the game has generally been positive, with most praising <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the genre, while its navigation and localization were criticized. Its PSP port shared most points of praise with the original, along with the improved localization, but also drew negative comments for its by-then dated mechanics and graphics.|$|E
5|$|Rick {{maintained}} its peak intensity for roughly two hours between 7:00pm and 9:00pm PDT (0200 and 0400 UTC) on October17, before {{it began to}} weaken {{in response to an}} eyewall replacement cycle and increasing wind shear. By the afternoon of October18, the storm had weakened to a low-end Category5 hurricane, with maximum winds of 160mph (260km/h). Deep convection around the eye warmed slightly and a combination of dry air and wind shear restrained the extent of the storms' outflow to the west. Later that day, Rick began to turn towards the northwest as the subtropical ridge north of the system began to weaken. Early on October19, Rick was downgraded to a Category3 hurricane as it began <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> {{the southern end of the}} Baja California peninsula. Wind shear and dry air quickly entered the core of the system, with the eye disappearing from satellite imagery later that morning.|$|E
5|$|The BRA {{subsequently}} re-evaluated <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> {{urban renewal}} in its future projects, including {{the construction of}} Government Center. In 1965, the Columbia Point Health Center opened in the Dorchester neighborhood, the first Community Health Center in the United States. It mostly served the massive Columbia Point public housing complex adjoining it, which was built in 1953. The health center is still in operation and was rededicated in 1990 as the Geiger-Gibson Community Health Center. The Columbia Point complex itself was redeveloped and revitalized from 1984 to 1990 into a mixed-income community called Harbor Point Apartments.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian {{government}} was criticised for <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the battle. Surviving defenders and right-wing political parties accused it of betrayal and of deliberately sacrificing Vukovar to secure international recognition for Croatia. The only explanation {{that many people}} were willing to accept for the town's fall was {{that it had been}} given up as part of a conspiracy. The commanders of the Croatian forces in Vukovar, Mile Dedaković and Branko Borković, both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by Croatian military police, and the Croatian government suppressed an issue of the newspaper Slobodni tjednik that published a transcript of a telephone call from Vukovar, in which Dedaković had pleaded with an evasive Tuđman for military assistance. The revelations caused public outrage and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed.|$|E
5|$|The {{advisory}} board attempts to remain apolitical and pragmatic in <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> selecting {{new members of}} the Order of Canada, generally operating without input from ministers of the Crown; political interference has occurred only once, when in 1978 Paul Desmarais's investiture was delayed for six months by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. However, some of the committee's selections have caused controversy. For instance, the admission in 2001 of sex educator Sue Johanson, host of the long-running Sunday Night Sex Show, as a Member stirred controversy among some of Canada's Christian organizations, as Johanson had taught teenagers methods of safe sex alongside abstinence. Similarly, the acceptance of birth control advocate Elizabeth Bagshaw and gay rights campaigner Brent Hawkes also incited debate.|$|E
5|$|The poem is an elegy in {{name but}} not in form; it employs a style {{similar to that of}} {{contemporary}} odes, but it embodies a meditation on death, and remembrance after death. The poem argues that the remembrance can be good and bad, and the narrator finds comfort in pondering the lives of the obscure rustics buried in the churchyard. The two versions of the poem, Stanzas and Elegy, approach death differently; the first contains a stoic response to death, but the final version contains an epitaph which serves to repress the narrator's fear of dying. With its discussion of, and focus on, the obscure and the known, the poem has possible political ramifications, but it does not make any definite claims on politics to be more universal in <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> life and death.|$|E

Megadeth spent nearly four months {{in the studio with}} Norman, writing and recording what became the band's most commercially successful effort, Countdown to Extinction. The album, whose title was suggested by Menza, features songwriting contributions from each band member. Ellefson explained that the band changed <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> songwriting for this album, beginning to write more melodic songs.|$|E
5|$|Although modern {{biology is}} a {{relatively}} recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. Natural philosophy was studied {{as early as the}} ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indian subcontinent, and China. However, the origins of modern biology and <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the study of nature are most often traced back to ancient Greece. While the formal study of medicine dates back to Hippocrates (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC), it was Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his History of Animals and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|SR522, named Lake City Way within Seattle city limits, {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with I-5 in the Roosevelt neighborhood of northern Seattle, east of Green Lake. The interchange only allows movements south towards Downtown Seattle on I-5, {{and includes a}} connection to the freeway's reversible express lane system. The highway travels northeast from the interchange, tunneling under the intersection of Roosevelt Way NE and NE 75th Street; the intersection itself is connected to SR522 by a series of ramps to collector streets. Lake City Way continues northeast through Maple Leaf as a four-lane arterial street before turning north on <b>its</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> Thornton Creek. After crossing the creek, the highway enters the Lake City neighborhood, passing several car dealerships. Lake City itself is a designated urban village, with mixed-use development and apartment buildings that are centered around the intersection of Lake City Way between NE 125th Street and NE 145th Street. At NE 145th Street, SR522 intersects SR523 and crosses into Lake Forest Park.|$|E
