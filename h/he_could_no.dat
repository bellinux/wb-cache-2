5|$|In 662, Maximus {{was placed}} on trial once more, and was once more convicted of heresy. Following the trial Maximus was tortured, having his tongue cut out, so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer speak his rebellion, and his right hand cut off, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer write letters. Maximus was then exiled to the Lazica or Colchis region of modern-day Georgia and was cast in the {{fortress}} of Schemarum, perhaps Muris-Tsikhe near the modern town of Tsageri. He died soon thereafter, on 13 August 662. The events of the trials of Maximus were recorded by Anastasius Bibliothecarius.|$|E
5|$|By 1801, Priestley {{had become}} so ill that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer write or experiment. He died {{on the morning of}} 6 February 1804, aged seventy and was buried at Riverview Cemetery in Northumberland, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Himmler began {{developing}} {{the notion of}} a Germanic religion and wanted SS members to leave the church. In early 1936, Heydrich left the Catholic Church. His wife, Lina, had already done so the year before. Heydrich not only felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer be a member, but came to consider the church's political power and influence a danger to the state.|$|E
60|$|But when he {{says that}} Christ ascended far above all heavens, we are to believe this--that he ascended to God himself. So high that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> go <b>no</b> higher; so far that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> go <b>no</b> farther.|$|R
60|$|He shivered {{slightly}} and protested that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> remember <b>no</b> more.|$|R
60|$|Having <b>no</b> reply ready, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do <b>no</b> {{better than}} embrace her.|$|R
5|$|In June 1874, Clayton {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer control matters in Arkansas {{and that he}} and his friends would be willing to enter into any arrangement whereby they could at least be safe from persecution and prosecution. However, the Democrats retaliated by impeaching many Minstrels, including Supreme Court Justice John McClure. Clayton finished his Senate term but was not re-elected.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he lived}} to be 73 years old, Hutchinson {{suffered}} with poor health most of his life, and was for the last eighteen years of life incapacitated by grave illness. Before 1920 he left his Sussex home, Shepherds Gate, Coleman's Hatch across Royal Ashdown Forest Golf Club from Forest Row and moved to 29 Lennox Gardens, Chelsea, London. Eighteen years after <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer play golf he committed suicide there on 27 July 1932. He was survived by his wife. According to his 1932 probate, his wealth at death was £26,337 (£ today).|$|E
5|$|Although the {{sentence}} meted {{to him was}} eventually reduced, the corruption case had left permanent damage on Knight's career as a civil servant. After investigations on him began in March 1991, he faced disciplinary hearings and his services were terminated on 26 March 1992. The President also revoked the prestigious Public Administration Medal, Gold, that had been awarded to Knight. In August 1994, the High Court struck Knight off the roll of advocates and solicitors, meaning that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer practise law. After being disbarred, Knight worked as a consultant in a public-listed company.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him, her eyes expressionless {{and full of}} darkness. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> see <b>no</b> answer.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the captain}} stopped suddenly. He opened his mouth, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find <b>no</b> {{immediate}} words.|$|R
60|$|At this he was clasped {{so tightly}} to his mother's breast that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> say <b>no</b> more.|$|R
5|$|At 15:05 another British ship {{appeared}} on the horizon, the sloop , which persuaded Montfort that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer protect the battered Pomone against superior numbers. Pauline set all sail to the west, away from her opponents who were either too battered or too distant to pursue. Alceste and Active now concentrated their full broadsides on Pomone, which soon lost both masts {{and was forced to}} surrender to prevent total destruction. Pauline escaped, later reaching Ancona safely but having suffered severe damage in the engagement.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1877, PedroII paid a {{visit to}} Caxias and ascertained that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer remain in office. The entire cabinet {{resigned}} on 1 January 1878. His health problems had become so troubling that he had been asking repeatedly to resign since early 1876. Caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health, but increasingly felt a sense of alienation. He did not feel he could play a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an older generation who perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as essential for holding the nation together.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{ordered his}} field {{officers}} {{to inspect the}} troops and to report back with the condition of his troops. The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his troops {{to a point that}} he judged that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer hold back the Union forces at his front lines. Ammunition in the camp was also dwindling; each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece. With their supplies destroyed by Stoneman's troops at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon, there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in the near future.|$|E
60|$|Her {{voice trailed}} off. The muscles of Jimmy's back {{tightened}} and quivered. But <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find <b>no</b> words.|$|R
60|$|He {{burst out}} {{laughing}} at himself; for the truth is, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> sing <b>no</b> better than an owl.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> say <b>no</b> more, for {{the sweetest}} {{form in the}} world had locked him in her arms.|$|R
5|$|By now aged nearly 56, Kruger {{resolved}} that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina {{moved to}} Church Street, Pretoria, {{from where he}} could easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache {{and most of his}} facial hair, leaving the chinstrap beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called Kruger House, would be completed in 1884.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008, Speight found Collins's body in {{the bath}} of their shared London flat. He was arrested on {{suspicion}} of her murder, but not charged with any offence. An inquest later determined that Collins {{had died of a}} drug overdose and severe burns from hot water. In April that year, Speight was reported missing and was later discovered to have taken his own life by hanging himself near Paddington station. Two suicide notes were discovered, describing how <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer live without Collins.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII {{encouraged}} {{his niece}} {{to write her}} memoirs, as he wished them {{to be used as}} Bourbon propaganda. In 1796 and 1803, Louis also used the diaries of Louis XVI's final attendants in the same way. In January 1801, Tsar Paul told Louis XVIII that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer live in Russia. The court at Jelgava was so low on funds that it had to auction some of its possessions to afford the journey out of Russia. Marie-Thérèse even sold a diamond necklace that the Emperor Paul had given her as a wedding gift.|$|E
60|$|What {{could be}} Manston's reason {{for such an}} astounding trick <b>he</b> <b>could</b> by <b>no</b> stretch of {{imagination}} divine.|$|R
60|$|Lassiter {{spread wide}} his hands, {{as if to}} signify <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do <b>no</b> more, and his face clouded.|$|R
60|$|The {{scientific}} gentleman smilingly anticipated Pruffle's {{reply that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> assign <b>no</b> cause {{for them at}} all. Pruffle meditated.|$|R
5|$|Mexican actor Pedro Armendáriz was {{recommended}} to Young by director John Ford to play Kerim Bey. After experiencing increasing discomfort {{on location in}} Istanbul, Armendáriz was diagnosed with inoperable cancer. Filming in Istanbul was terminated, the production moved to Britain, and Armendáriz's scenes were brought forward {{so that he could}} complete his scenes without delay. Though visibly in pain, he continued working as long as possible. When <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer work, he returned home and took his own life. Remaining shots after Armendáriz left London had a stunt double and Terence Young himself as stand-ins.|$|E
5|$|Roope, who drowned when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer {{hang on to}} a rope whilst {{being pulled}} {{up the side of}} the cruiser, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, thus {{becoming}} the first VC recipient of the Second World War. The award was justified, in part, by the recommendation of Heye, who wrote to the British authorities via the Red Cross, giving a statement of the valiant courage Roope had shown when engaging a much superior ship in close battle. Ramsay was also awarded the DSO. Both awards were made after the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Too weak {{to stand}} or walk, Beauchamp was loaded onto a cart to be {{conveyed}} to the gallows. He begged to see Anna, but the guards {{told him she}} was not seriously injured. The guards finally allowed him to see Anna, and Beauchamp was angered that they had underplayed her critical condition. He stayed with her until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer feel her pulse; then the guards took him to the gallows to be hanged before he died of his stab wounds.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008 Carol Hutchins said, [...] "My dad {{was full}} of adventure. In my mind, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do <b>no</b> wrong." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{councillor}} who {{was noted}} for his historical studies, answered {{that at the}} moment <b>he</b> <b>could</b> recall <b>no</b> such case.|$|R
60|$|Prescott {{described}} how it felt, though {{he explained that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find <b>no</b> sign of injury, and the other nodded.|$|R
5|$|About 19:45, the 1st Army Group held {{a conference}} in Zagreb, just as German tanks were {{entering}} the city. Nedeljković told Petrović that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer hold his positions, but despite this, Petrović ordered him to hold for at least 2–3 days to enable {{the withdrawal of the}} 7th Army to the Kupa river. Nedeljković replied that he no longer had an army, and suggested that all Serb officers and men be ordered back to form a defensive line along the Sava and Una rivers. Petrović refused to consider this, but ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to form a defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|Ford reappears in the {{official}} novel continuation Stargate Atlantis Legacy: The Third Path. To their surprise, the team finds Ford alive and {{with a group of}} nomadic humans known as the Travelers. He explains to Sheppard he managed to escape the hive ship before it was destroyed, but crashed on the planet over which the battle took place. With the help of the Travelers, he recovered from his addiction but it took so long that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer find Atlantis afterwards. Ford began leading a guerilla campaign against the Wraith, aided by the Travelers. He also now has a wife and son and regrets his previous actions under the Wraith enzyme. At the end of the novel, Ford is safely returned to Earth with his wife and son and reunites with his cousin and grandparents.|$|E
5|$|He read until 1 a.m., until {{with tears}} and sobs {{he said that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>no</b> longer {{physically}} continue, the previous three nights of sleeplessness and fear about the future having taken their toll. Gravel ended the session by, with no other senators present, establishing unanimous consent to insert 4,100 pages of the Papers into the Congressional Record of his subcommittee. The following day, the Supreme Court's New York Times Co. v. United States decision {{ruled in favor of}} the newspapers and publication in The Times and others resumed. In July 1971, Bantam Books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material The Times had published.|$|E
