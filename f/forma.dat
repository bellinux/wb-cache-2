40|$|The genetic {{relatedness}} of five <b>formae</b> speciales of Fusarium oxysporum causing wilts of cucurbit plants {{was determined by}} DNA fingerprinting with the moderately repetitive DNA sequences FOLR 1 to FOLR 4. The four FOLR clones were chosen from a genomic library made from F. oxysporum f. sp. lagenariae 03 - 05118. Total DNAs from 50 strains representing five cucurbit-infecting <b>formae</b> speciales, cucumerinum, melonis, lagenariae, niveum, and momordicae, and 6 strains of <b>formae</b> speciales pathogenic to other plants were digested with EcoRV and hybridized with 32 P-labeled FOLR probes. The strains were clearly distinguishable at the <b>formae</b> specialis level {{on the basis of}} FOLR DNA fingerprints. Fifty-two fingerprint types were detected among the 56 strains by using all FOLR probes. These probes were used to infer phylogenetic relationships among the DNA fingerprint types by the unweighted pair group method using averages and parsimony analysis. The fingerprint types detected in each of the <b>formae</b> speciales cucumerinum, lagenariae, niveum, and momordicae were grouped into a single cluster. However, two different genetic groups occurred in the <b>formae</b> specialis melonis. The two groups also differed in pathogenicity: one group caused wilts of muskmelon and oriental melon, while the second was pathogenic only to muskmelon. The fingerprint types of different <b>formae</b> speciales pathogenic to plants other than cucurbits were distinguishable from one another and from the fingerprints of the cucurbit-infecting strains. These results suggest that the cucurbit-infecting <b>formae</b> speciales are intraspecific variants distinguishable at the DNA level and in their host range...|$|R
5|$|The fruit bodies {{can last}} for some {{considerable}} time, growing slowly over a month. Mushrooms in subalpine and alpine areas are typically heavy-set with a short stipe, their growth slower in the cold climate. This latter form is seen at lower altitudes in colder seasons. Smith gave this the name <b>forma</b> rainierensis. Conversely, mushrooms at low altitudes, {{such as in the}} redwood forests, can grow and expand rapidly with large caps that have prominent scales. Smith described a paler form with a solid stipe from the Sierra Nevada as <b>forma</b> wilsonii. American mycologist R. H. Petersen described an olive-capped form that is otherwise identical to the typical form. These forms are not recognised as distinct.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Maiden {{described}} variety lucida in 1902, and Bailey described variety glabrescens in 1913. Both had diagnosed their varieties on {{the basis}} of their hairlessness. Maiden described a taxon totally devoid of hair, while Bailey described his as nearly glabrous (hairless). As Bailey's description more closely matched Dixon's findings (that these variants were only partly and not completely hairless), Dixon retained Bailey's name and reclassified it as Ficus rubiginosa <b>forma</b> glabrescens in 2001 as it differed only in the lack of hairs on new growth from the nominate form.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} epithet nidiformis {{is derived}} from the Latin terms nīdus 'nest' and <b>forma</b> 'shape' or 'form', hence 'nest shaped'. Lampas {{is derived from}} the Greek lampas/λαμπας 'torch'. Common names include ghost fungus and Australian glow fungus. Drummond reported that the local aborigines were fearful when shown the luminescent fungus and called out chinga, a local word for spirit; Drummond himself likened it to a will-o'-the-wisp. Likewise on the Springbrook Plateau in southeastern Queensland, the local Kombumerri people believed the lights to be ancestors and gave the area a wide berth out of respect.|$|E

5|$|This fern was {{at first}} {{identified}} by André Michaux, in 1803, as black spleenwort (Asplenium adiantum-nigrum). Carl Ludwig Willdenow recognized and {{described it as a}} separate species, which he named Asplenium montanum, in 1810. In 1901, John A. Shafer attempted to transfer it to the genus Athyrium as Athyrium montanum, but this name is illegitimate as a later homonym of Athyrium montanum (Lam.) Röhl. ex Spreng. The species was segregated from Asplenium as Chamaefilix montana by Oliver Atkins Farwell in 1931. The change was not widely accepted and current authorities do not recognize this segregate genus. In 1974, Timothy Reeves described an unusual population of A.montanum from the Shawangunk Mountains. Having used chromatography to show {{that it was not a}} hybrid, he interpreted it as a new form, Asplenium montanum <b>forma</b> shawangunkense. In this form, as contrasted with the usual <b>forma</b> montanum, the leaf blade is yellow-green, the fronds continue highly dissected to the apex and do not come to a pointed tip, the fronds are shorter and more highly dissected than usual, and all fronds are sterile.|$|E
5|$|John de Gray or de Grey (died 18 October 1214) was {{a medieval}} English Bishop of Norwich, and the elected but {{unconfirmed}} Archbishop of Canterbury. He was {{employed in the}} service of John of England even before John's coronation as king, for which he was rewarded with a number of ecclesiastical offices, culminating in his pro <b>forma</b> election to Norwich in 1200. De Gray continued in royal service after his elevation to the episcopate, lending the King money and undertaking diplomatic missions on his behalf. In 1205 King John attempted to further reward de Gray with a translation to the archbishopric of Canterbury, but a disputed election process led to de Gray's selection being quashed by Pope Innocent III in 1206.|$|E

25|$|In Roman Catholic churches, it was {{traditionally}} said at Prime on Sundays {{when the}} Office {{was of the}} Sunday.
