40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to isolate and identify bacterial contaminants of some Sudanese paper currency notes. This study was conducted in Khartoum State in the period from May to October 2005. Sixty paper bills of five different denominations (100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 SD) were collected randomly from different sources including bus drivers, groceries, hospital pharmacies, butchers, cafeterias and medical laboratories. Each bill was preserved in sterile plastic <b>file</b> <b>bag</b> and transported to the microbiology lab for bacteriological examinations. The study revealed that the frequency of bacterial isolation from different samples was 24. 5 % for hospital pharmacies, 21. 6 % for medical diagnostic lab., 17. 6 % for bus drivers, 13. 7 % for butchers, 11. 8 % for groceries and 10. 8 % for cafeterias. The rate of bacterial isolation from different denominations were 34. 3 %, 31. 4 %, 14. 7 %, 13. 7 % and 5. 9 % for 200, 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 SD, respectively. The study indicated that Klebsiella pneumoniae(13. 7 %), Bacillus spp(12. 7 %), Staphylococcus epidermidis (10. 8 %), Salmonella spp (9. 7 %), Serratia spp(8. 8 %), E coli (7. 8 %), Pseudomonas aerugenosa (6. 9 %), Enterobacter spp(6. 9 %), Yesrssinia spp (6. 9 %), Staph aureus (5. 9 %),Proteus spp(4. 9 %), Hafnia alvei (2. 9 %) and Citrobacter spp (2 %). Were the most frequently isolatedbacterial species contaminating Sudanese currency notes...|$|E
50|$|The Eco-Friends {{club was}} {{launched}} in 2003 in Malabar Christian College. Since then it {{has been active in}} mentoring students to be environment friendly. As a part of this campaign the club runs a small unit where students manufacture paper <b>bags,</b> <b>files,</b> pen stands, leaf plates and CD covers. A bee keeping unit and a rockery with a garden and a water-fall were also started by the club in 2011. The products are marketed within the campus. The sale proceeds are used to run the club. At the end of their three-year tenure in the club the college awards an Eco-Friends Certificate to each of the final year student members in appreciation for their service.|$|R

5000|$|Serena is re-united with Dan {{again in}} a last attempt to make things work. Dan, on his hand, has been writing a scathingly honest sequel to [...] "Inside" [...] {{with the help of}} Georgina. One of his last and most poignant {{chapters}} is The Serena Chapter, which is released during the Thanksgiving party. Serena is, in the chapter, described as a [...] "Golden girl" [...] who lives for attention and love, and dramatically ends things with Dan. She decides to move away from New York, but is intercepted by Dan, who tries to convince her that he has always loved her and always will. Hurt and upset, she doesn't believe him, and leaves. Before she leaves, Dan slides a <b>file</b> into her <b>bag,</b> which she opens on the plane before take-off. It is revealed that Dan wrote two chapters on Serena, and that the second one was the [...] "Good Serena Chapter". She gets off the plane and goes to talk things through thoroughly with Dan.|$|R
40|$|You can {{sometimes}} spot {{them in the}} streets in the Netherlands, the white lorries of the Van Gansewinkel waste disposal company. A while ago the company even had a radio commercial. To emphasize the companys reliability, the message was read by Mr Wil Simon, who used to present the Dutch equivalent of the BBC Televisions Crime Watch. He warned the listener that without the professional attentions of Van Gansewinkel,confidential information could end up on the street, and possibly into the hands of third parties. This morning, a blue plastic refuse bag was found along the A 2 motorway near Amsterdam. In addition to some disposable coffee cups, the bag contained three folders with confidential <b>files.</b> Could the <b>bag</b> have come from your company? Members of Kube Design, a project team of students at the faculty of Industrial Design, looked into the problem {{and came up with a}} solution: have a "locust" on your desk. The idea has caught on and Van Gansewinkel has taken the design into production...|$|R
40|$|A pipe {{structure}} and a desk sequence provide visual, inertial & depth data, {{as well as}} ground truth for both the pose of the sensor head and the 3 D scene. The dataset can be download from [URL] (Size 85 GB). Users are asked to cite the following paper, where the dataset has been introduced: Marco Karrer, Mina Kamel, Roland Siegwart and Margarita Chli, “Real-time Dense Surface Reconstruction for Aerial Manipulation”, in Proceedings of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2016. Available Data: For each scene, this dataset provides: monochrome stereo images, inertial measurements from a MEMS IMU, depth data from a PMD Picoflexx time-of-flight camera and RGBD data from an Intel RealSense R 200. The ground truth of the sensor pose has been captured using a Vicon external tracking system, while the scene ground truth was captured by a Leica MS 50 Theodolite Laser Scanner station (scans from different viewpoints have been aligned using the Iterative Closest Point algorithm). Calibration parameters are provided for the camera intrinsics, the polynomial depth correction model, the camera-to-IMU extrinsics, the camera-to-depth sensor extrinsics and the camera-to-Vicon marker extrinsics. The scene ground truth is stored as RGB point clouds in *. ply format. The sensor-readings, {{as well as the}} 6 DoF pose ground truth, are stored as ROS *. <b>bag</b> <b>files.</b> For any questions, please contact Marco Karrer<karrerm@student. ethz. ch...|$|R
40|$|NOAA 2 ̆ 7 s National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) {{provides}} the deep archive of US multibeam sonar hydrographic surveys. NOAA stores the data as Bathymetric Attributed Grids (BAG; [URL] that are HDF 5 formatted files containing gridded bathymetry, gridded uncertainty, and XML metadata. While NGDC {{provides the}} deep {{store and a}} basic ERSI ArcIMS interface to the data, additional tools need to be created to increase {{the frequency with which}} researchers discover hydrographic surveys that might be beneficial for their research. Using Open Source tools, we have created a draft of a Google Earth visualization of NOAA 2 ̆ 7 s complete collection of <b>BAG</b> <b>files</b> as of March 2009. Each survey is represented as a bounding box, an optional preview image of the survey data, and a pop up placemark. The placemark contains a brief summary of the metadata and links to directly download of the <b>BAG</b> survey <b>files</b> and the complete metadata file. Each survey is time tagged so that users can search both in space and time for surveys that meet their needs. By creating this visualization, we aim to make the entire process of data discovery, validation of relevance, and download much more efficient for research scientists who may not be familiar with NOAA 2 ̆ 7 s hydrographic survey efforts or the BAG format. In the process of creating this demonstration, we have identified a number of improvements that can be made to the hydrographic survey process {{in order to make the}} results easier to use especially with respect to metadata generation. With the combination of the NGDC deep archiving infrastructure, a Google Earth virtual globe visualization, and GeoRSS feeds of updates, we hope to increase the utilization of these high-quality gridded bathymetry. This workflow applies equally well to LIDAR topography and bathymetry. Additionally, with proper referencing and geotagging in journal publications, we hope to close the loop and help the community create a true “Geospatial Scholar” infrastructure...|$|R
