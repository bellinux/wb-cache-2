40|$|Introduction The {{subject of}} this bachelor’s thesis is radiographers’ use and attitudes towards the {{dosimeter}} in relation to guidelines and regulations. The background for the choice of subject {{is that we have}} observed radiographers using dosimeters in different ways. This led us to want to examine how radiographers view the correct use of the dosimeter in relation to existing guidelines and regulations. We have chosen to compare conditions in Norway with Namibia. We felt that {{it would be interesting to}} compare an international occupation in two different continents, where Norway is a country that is relatively rich in resources compared to Namibia. Is emphasis on the use of dosimeters as strong in Namibia as in Norway? Our problem: ”Do radiographers' use of dosimeters comply with the regulations and guidelines from the Radiation Protection Authority, and what are the attitudes of radiographers towards using dosimeters?” Methodology This thesis takes a qualitative approach. We chose to gather information using semi-structured interviews. An interview guide was used as a template and the interviews were recorded as audio files. A strategic selection of informants was carried out, where three radiographers were selected at a hospital in Norway, and three at a hospital in Namibia. By using this approach we wanted to gain a better understanding of the informants’ attitudes towards and use of dosimeters. Results All of the six informants want to use dosimeters on a daily basis for various reasons. In Namibia conditions are somewhat poorer than in Norway, and dosimeters are not so readily available. The radiographers demonstrated different attitudes towards and knowledge on the use of dosimeters. In Norway there are guidelines and regulations for the use of the dosimeter, but we have been unable to find such in Namibia. All of the informants recognize the benefits of using dosimeters, and all use them correctly. The informants displayed little knowledge of the guidelines and regulations concerning the use of dosimeters. Discussion We see that the informants wear dosimeters correctly, but we don’t believe that this is due to knowledge of guidelines and regulations for dosimeters. This is due to the fact that the interviews reveal a general lack of knowledge concerning regulations and guidelines. We believe that the Namibian informants display a greater interest in the use of dosimeters than the Norwegian informants, despite a poorly functioning <b>dosimetry</b> <b>service</b> in Namibia. We recognize that Norway has a well-functioning <b>dosimetry</b> <b>service,</b> but that the informants display less interest in checking the dosimeter readings...|$|E

40|$|Radioactive {{materials}} {{are used in}} many industries, and, whenever unsealed radioactive sources are present, intakes of radionuclides by workers can occur. Adequate radiation protection of workers is an essential requirement for the safe and acceptable use of radiation, radioactive materials and nuclear energy. Guidance on {{the application of the}} requirements of the International Basis Safety Standards for Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources (BSS) to occupational protection is given in three interrelated Safety Guides: Occupational Radiation Protection (RS-G- 1. 1); Assessment of Occupational Exposure due to Intakes of Radionuclides (RS-G- 1. 2); Assessment of Occupational Exposure due to External Sources of Radiation (RS-G- 1. 3) published in 1999 and further guidance is given in Safety Reports. Uranium, thorium and transuranic elements such as plutonium and americium are encountered throughout the nuclear fuel cycle and in industry. Radionuclides of these elements have a significant potential for internal radiation exposures when they are ingested or inhaled. As a result, the <b>dosimetry</b> <b>services</b> responsible for internal dose assessment must be capable of detecting such radionuclides deposited in the body in very low quantities. The detection problem is made more difficult because several of these radionuclides (e. g. sup 2 sup 3 sup 8 sup, sup 2 sup 3 sup 9 Pu, sup 2 sup 4 sup 1 Am, and sup 2 sup 3 sup 5 U) decay with the emission of low energy photons that are difficult to detect by direct measurement or in vivo methods. A variety of sophisticated detection systems has been developed to address this problem. In addition, complex anthropomorphic phantoms have been fabricated to provide for highly realistic detector calibrations. However, the measurement task remains highly challenging. The detection and calibration resources are costly, and relatively few <b>dosimetry</b> <b>services</b> are equipped to undertake these measurement tasks.

40|$|ABSTRACT Analysis for {{chromosome}} aberrations {{in human}} peripheral blood lymphocytes {{has been developed}} {{as an indicator of}} dose from ionising radiation. This paper outlines the mechanism of production of aberrations, the technique for their analysis and the dose-effect relationships for various types of radiation. During the past ten years the National Radiological Protection Board has developed a service for the UK in which estimates of dose from chromosome aberration analysis are made on people known or suspected of being accidentally over-exposed. This service can provide estimates where no physical dosemeter was worn and is frequently able to resolve anomalous or disputed data from routine film badges. Several problems in the interpretation of chromosome aberration yields are reviewed. These include the effects of partial body irradiation and the response to variations in dose rate and the intermittent nature of some exposures. The <b>dosimetry</b> <b>service</b> is supported by a research programme which includes surveys of groups of patients irradiated for medical purposes. Two surveys are described. In the first, lymphocyte aberrations were examined in rheumatiod arthritis patients receiving intra-articular injections of colloidal radiogold or radioyttrium.

The nuclear research centre SCK•CEN (Dutch: Studiecentrum voor Kernenergie; French: Centre d'Étude de l'énergie Nucléaire) uses a whole body TLD system based on Lithium Fluoride (LiF) with addition of Magnesium and Titanium. This SCK•CEN personal dosimetry system is nearly 30 years old, reaching the end of its life. Because the same system is no longer available on the market, a completely new dosimetry system will be needed. One of the possible dosimetry system candidates is the one based on Direct Ion Storage (DIS) technology. This is a system in-between passive and active dosimetry and has some remarkable advantages compared to present systems. This dosimeter, commercially known as Instadose 2, can communicate its results through a Bluetooth connection and should no longer be sent back to the <b>dosimetry</b> <b>service.</b> The objective of this work is to test this system for implementation in routine. This encompasses practical issues, like calibration and quality control issues, but also more formal type testing according to IEC International Standard 62387 “Radiation protection instrumentation – Passive integrating dosimetry systems for personal and environmental monitoring of photon and beta radiation”. This was done through a study on repeatability, a study on angular and energy response and environmental influences. The work is subdivided in three chapters.

40|$|Purpose: On 1 July 2012, the Australian Clinical <b>Dosimetry</b> <b>Service</b> (ACDS) {{released}} its Optically Stimulated Luminescent Dosimeter (OSLD) Level I audit, replacing the previous TLD based audit. The {{aim of this}} work is to present {{the results from this}} new service and the complete uncertainty analysis on which the audit tolerances are based. Methods: The audit release was preceded by a rigorous evaluation of the InLight® nanoDot OSLD system from Landauer (Landauer, Inc., Glenwood, IL). Energy dependence, signal fading from multiple irradiations, batch variation, reader variation, and dose response factors were identified and quantified for each individual OSLD. The detectors are mailed to the facility in small PMMA blocks, based on the design of the existing Radiological Physics Centre audit. Modeling and measurement were used to determine a factor that could convert the dose measured in the PMMA block, to dose in water for the facility&# 039;s reference conditions. This factor is dependent on the beam spectrum. The TPR 20, 10 was used as the beam quality index to determine the specific block factor for a beam being audited. The audit tolerance was defined using a rigorous uncertainty calculation. The audit outcome is then determined using a scientifically based two tiered action level approach. Audit outcomes within two standard deviations were defined as Pass (Optimal Level), within three standard deviations as Pass (Action Level), and outside of three standard deviations the outcome is Fail (Out of Tolerance). Results: To-date the ACDS has audited 108 photon beams with TLD and 162 photon beams with OSLD. The TLD audit results had an average deviation from ACDS of 0. 0 % and a standard deviation of 1. 8 %. The OSLD audit results had an average deviation of − 0. 2 % and a standard deviation of 1. 4 %. The relative combined standard uncertainty was calculated to be 1. 3 % (1 σ). Pass (Optimal Level) was reduced to ≤ 2. 6 % (2 σ), and Fail (Out of Tolerance) was reduced to > 3. 9 % (3 σ) for the new OSLD audit. Previously with the TLD audit the Pass (Optimal Level) and Fail (Out of Tolerance) were set at ≤ 4. 0 % (2 σ) and > 6. 0 % (3 σ). Conclusions: The calculated standard uncertainty of 1. 3 % at one standard deviation is consistent with the measured standard deviation of 1. 4 % from the audits and confirming the suitability of the uncertainty budget derived audit tolerances. The OSLD audit shows greater accuracy than the previous TLD audit, justifying the reduction in audit tolerances. In the TLD audit, all outcomes were Pass (Optimal Level) suggesting that the tolerances were too conservative. In the OSLD audit 94 % of the audits have resulted in Pass (Optimal level) and 6 % of the audits have resulted in Pass (Action Level). All Pass (Action level) results have been resolved with a repeat OSLD audit, or an on-site ion chamber measurement...|$|E

40|$|Passive, {{solid-state}} detectors still {{dominate the}} field of neutron personal dosimetry, mainly thanks to their low cost, high reliability and elevated throughput. However, the recent appearance in the market of several electronic personal dosemeters for neutrons presents {{a challenge to the}} exclusive use of passive systems for primary or official dosimetry. This scenario drives research and development activities on passive dosemeters towards systems offering greater accuracy of response and lower detection limits. In addition, further applications and properties of the passive detectors, which are not met by the electronic devices, are also being explored. In particular, extensive investigations are in progress on the use of solid-state detectors for aviation and space dosimetry, where high-energy neutron fields are encountered. The present situation is also stimulating an acceleration in the development of international standards on performance and test requirements for passive dosimetry systems, which can expedite significantly the implementation of techniques in commercial personal <b>dosimetry</b> <b>services.</b> Upcoming standards will cover thermoluminescence albedo dosemeters, etched-track detectors, superheated emulsions and direct ion storage chambers, attesting to the level of maturity reached by these techniques. This work reviews the developments in {{the field of}} passive neutron dosimetry emerged since the previous Neutron Dosimetry Symposium, reporting on the current status of the subject and indicating the direction of ongoing research...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis work {{presents}} the Australian Clinical <b>Dosimetry</b> <b>Service's</b> (ACDS) findings {{of an investigation}} of systematic discrepancies between treatment planning system (TPS) calculated and measured audit doses. Specifically, a comparison between the Anisotropic Analytic Algorithm (AAA) and other common dose-calculation algorithms in regions downstream (≥ 2 cm) from low-density material in anthropomorphic and slab phantom geometries is presented. Two measurement setups involving rectilinear slab-phantoms (ACDS Level II audit) and anthropomorphic geometries (ACDS Level III audit) were {{used in conjunction with}} ion chamber (planar 2 D array and Farmer-type) measurements. Measured doses were compared to calculated doses for a variety of cases, with and without the presence of inhomogeneities and beam-modifiers in 71 audits. Results demonstrate a systematic AAA underdose with an average discrepancy of 2. 9  ±  1. 2 % when the AAA algorithm is implemented in regions distal from lung-tissue interfaces, when lateral beams are used with anthropomorphic phantoms. This systemic discrepancy was found for all Level III audits of facilities using the AAA algorithm. This discrepancy is not seen when identical measurements are compared for other common dose-calculation algorithms (average discrepancy − 0. 4  ±  1. 7 %), including the Acuros XB algorithm also available with the Eclipse TPS. For slab phantom geometries (Level II audits), with similar measurement points downstream from inhomogeneities this discrepancy is also not seen...|$|R
40|$|Supported by the European Commission, the EVIDOS project {{started in}} November 2001 with the broad goal of {{evaluating}} {{state of the}} art dosimetry techniques in representative workplaces of the nuclear industry. Seven European institutes joined efforts with end users at nuclear power plants, at fuel processing and reprocessing plants, and at transport and storage facilities. A comprehensive programme was devised to evaluate capabilities and limitations of standard and innovative personal dosemeters in relation to the mixed neutron-photon fields of concern to the nuclear industry. This paper describes the criteria behind the selection of dosimetry techniques and workplaces that were analysed, as well as the organisation of the measurement campaigns. Particular emphasis was placed on the evaluation of a variety of electronic personal dosemeters, either commercially available or previously developed by the partners. The estimates provided by these personal dosemeters were compared to reference values of dose equivalent quantities derived from spectrometry and fluence-to-dose equivalent conversion coefficients. Spectrometry was performed both with conventional multisphere and with some original instrumentation providing energy and direction resolution, based on silicon detectors and superheated drop detectors mounted on or in spherical moderators. The results were collected in a large, searchable database and are intended {{to be used in the}} harmonisation of dosimetric procedures for mixed radiation fields and for the approval of <b>dosimetry</b> <b>services</b> in Europ...|$|R
40|$|The Hanford External Dosimetry Technical Basis Manual PNL-MA- 842 {{documents}} {{the design and}} implementation of the external dosimetry system used at Hanford. The manual describes the dosimeter design, processing protocols, dose calculation methodology, radiation fields encountered, dosimeter response characteristics, limitations of dosimeter design under field conditions, and makes recommendations for effective use of the dosimeters in the field. The manual describes the technical basis for the dosimetry system in a manner intended to help ensure defensibility of the dose of record at Hanford and to demonstrate compliance with 10 CFR 835, DOELAP, DOE-RL, ORP, PNSO, and Hanford contractor requirements. The dosimetry system is operated by PNNL’s Hanford External Dosimetry Program (HEDP) which provides <b>dosimetry</b> <b>services</b> to all Hanford contractors. The primary users of this manual are DOE and DOE contractors at Hanford using the <b>dosimetry</b> <b>services</b> of PNNL. Development and maintenance of this manual is funded directly by DOE and DOE contractors. Its contents have been reviewed and approved by DOE and DOE contractors at Hanford through the Hanford Personnel Dosimetry Advisory Committee (HPDAC) which is chartered and chaired by DOE-RL and serves as means of coordinating dosimetry practices across contractors at Hanford. This manual was established in 1996. Since its inception, it has been revised many times and maintained by PNNL as a controlled document with controlled distribution. The first revision to be released through PNNL’s Electronic Records & Information Capture Architecture (ERICA) database was designated Revision 0. Revision numbers that are whole numbers reflect major revisions typically involving significant changes to all chapters in the document. Revision numbers that include a decimal fraction reflect minor revisions, usually restricted to selected chapters or selected pages in the document. Maintenance and distribution of controlled hard copies of the manual by PNNL was discontinued beginning with Revision 0. 2. Revision Log: Rev. 0 (2 / 25 / 2005) Major revision and expansion. Rev. 0. 1 (3 / 12 / 2007) Updated Chapters 5, 6 and 9 to reflect change in default ring calibration factor used in HEDP dose calculation software. Factor changed from 1. 5 to 2. 0 beginning January 1, 2007. Pages on which changes were made are as follows: 5. 23, 5. 69, 5. 78, 5. 80, 5. 82, 6. 3, 6. 5, 6. 29, and 9. 2. Rev 0. 2 (8 / 28 / 2009) Updated Chapters 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9. Chapters 6 and 8 were significantly expanded. References in the Preface and Chapters 1, 2, 4, and 7 were updated to reflect updates to DOE documents. Approved by HPDAC on 6 / 2 / 2009. Rev 1. 0 (1 / 1 / 2010) Major revision. Updated all chapters to reflect the Hanford site wide implementation on January 1, 2010 of new DOE requirements for occupational radiation protection. The new requirements are given in the June 8, 2007 amendment to 10 CFR 835 Occupational Radiation Protection (Federal Register, June 8, 2007. Title 10 Part 835. U. S., Code of Federal Regulations, Vol. 72, No. 110, 31904 - 31941).
