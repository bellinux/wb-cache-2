50|$|Glaciers scoured {{this land}} {{during one of}} the Neoproterozoic Snowball earth episodes (≈630 Ma) and the {{remarkable}} Arabian-Nubian peneplain is overlain by the greatest sand sheet on Earth, the Cambro-Ordovician Siq/Saq sands. This is exposed in spectacular cliffs like the site of Petra in Jordan. The Arabian sandstones are overlain by thick deposits of younger sediments that dip and thicken eastwards into the Persian Gulf. These sands are missing in most of Egypt and Sudan, instead the ANS is overlain by the late Mesozoic Nubian sandstones. All of these sediments were peeled off by erosion to expose the ANS, and much of this sand was reworked by desert winds to make great sand dunes in western Egypt and the Ar Rub al Khali (<b>Empty</b> <b>Quarter)</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arabia.</b>|$|E

50|$|Oman {{is located}} in the southeastern <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the Arabian Peninsula and covers a total land area of 309,500 square kilometers. The land area is {{composed}} of varying topographic features: valleys and desert account for 82 percent of the land mass; mountain ranges, 15 percent; and the coastal plain, 3 percent.The sultanate is flanked by the Gulf of Oman, the Arabian Sea, and the Rub' al Khali (<b>Empty</b> <b>Quarter)</b> <b>of</b> Saudi <b>Arabia,</b> all <b>of</b> which contributed to Oman's isolation. Historically, the country's contacts {{with the rest of the}} world were by sea, which not only provided access to foreign lands but also linked the coastal towns of Oman. The Rub al Khali, difficult to cross even with modern desert transport, formed a barrier between the sultanate and the Arabian interior. The Al Hajar Mountains, which form a belt between the coast and the desert from the Musandam Peninsula (Ras Musandam) to the city of Sur at Oman's easternmost point, formed another barrier. These geographic barriers kept the interior of Oman free from foreign military encroachments.|$|R
50|$|Wilfred Thesiger {{was born}} into a privileged English background, the son of a diplomat, educated at Eton and Oxford. As soon as he could, on his first summer holiday at university, he {{travelled}} to Istanbul, going out by tramp steamer, back by train: the first of many adventurous journeys. At age 23 he went on his first exploration, of the Awash River in Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). He became a colonial officer in Sudan, working in the desert region of Darfur and then the swampy Sudd, where he was responsible for shooting lions. While in Darfur he journeyed with local people by camel and visited the Tibesti mountains in the Sahara. In the Second World War he fought to liberate Abyssinia under the eccentric but charismatic Orde Wingate, and in the Special Air Service behind enemy lines in the Western Desert of north Africa. After the war he joined the anti-locust unit of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, taking the chance between 1945 and 1949 to travel in the <b>Empty</b> <b>Quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arabia.</b> Arabian Sands describes his two crossings of that region.|$|E
