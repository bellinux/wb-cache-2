We present several arguments to suggest that the isothermal assumption is reasonable but that a more detailed understanding of the small-scale molecular dynamics near the boundary may be required. Second, we show that a simplified model for thermoflow multiplicity in a cooled tube is inconsistent, when the stationary non-Newtonian flow is assumed to be incompressible without radial pressure gradients and without radial velocity. This inconsistency can be removed by allowing for weak compressibility effects in the down-steam area...|$|R
