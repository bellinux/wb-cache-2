5|$|Later, Bilac {{escapes from}} the room {{in which he is}} being held without exiting through the only door. Mulder notices a large <b>drag</b> <b>mark</b> through the dust on the floor, {{discovering}} a hatch leading to the museum's old steam tunnels. While exploring the tunnels, the agents find the remains of the victims and are attacked by a multitude of feral cats. As they try to escape, they come across Bilac's mutilated body. The two agents make their way out and close the hatch on the pursuing cats. The episode closes with Mulder suspecting that the animal attacks were associated with the burial urn that had been removed against the wishes of the Ecuadorian tribespeople; it is shortly returned to the burial grounds, where the local shaman watches the urn's reburial with jaguar-like eyes.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the bodies}} were uncovered, Marianne Schmidt was found lying on her right side with her left leg bent. Christine Sharrock was face down, {{her head against the}} sole of Schmidt's left foot. From a 34-metre long <b>drag</b> <b>mark</b> leading to the scene, police {{determined}} that Sharrock had fled, possibly while Schmidt was dying, only to have been caught, murdered and dragged back to the body of her friend. Attempts had been made to rape both girls. Sharrock's skull had been fractured by a blow {{to the back of the}} head and she had been stabbed multiple times. Schmidt's throat had been slashed and she too had been stabbed several times. Schmidt's brother Hans had viewed photos of her body and said, [...] "She'd been stabbed 25 to 30 times. She'd almost been decapitated because her throat had been cut so viciously." [...] Semen was found on both girls but the autopsy showed that both girls' hymens were intact.|$|E
5000|$|The {{body was}} lying on the left of the roof {{entrance}} near the external unit of the air conditioner (AC), and was covered by a panel from the roof cooler. The body was dragged towards to AC unit, as the quantity of blood was more near the AC unit. An expert from [...] Gandhinagar as well as a team of experts from CFSL concluded that the <b>drag</b> <b>mark</b> on the roof resulted from a blood-soaked body being dragged after being kept in a bed sheet. This raised suspicion that Hemraj might have been killed somewhere else, and his body dragged to the terrace in order to hide it. However, in June 2008, CBI's UV Light testing team reported that it didn't find Hemraj's bloodstains anywhere except the terrace. So, unless the killer cleaned up the original murder spot, Hemraj seems to have been killed on the terrace. The blood found on the staircase leading to the terrace on 17 May might have come from the mattress that the cleaners were trying to dump on the terrace.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Present work is {{the first}} report of Early Permian xiphosurid trackways from India. Surface trackways and undertracks, {{preserved}} within ice-marginal storm-affected, shoreface sediments of the Talchir Formation, Jayanti coalbasin closely resemble Kouphichnium Nopsca 1923. Trackways reveal distinct heteropody with foliate pusher impressions, paired series of semi-circular, oval, V- or Y-shaped chilate (walking) leg impressions. Varied ventral impressions also include telson <b>drag</b> <b>marks</b> and telson dents; spine <b>drag</b> <b>marks,</b> book -gills impression, genal gouges as well as symmetric, paired lateral genal furrows, partial cubichnial impressions of prosoma and spinose opisthosoma. A tentative early Permian age (Asselian/Sakmarian) and marginal marine facies association points towards a paleolimuloidae affinity for the trace makers, which is in conformity with their inferred widths of exoskeleton, sub-rounded prosoma and subtriangular spinose opisthosoma with predictable movable spines. Flexed pusher impressions and co-dominant pincer impressions as well as, other ventral impressions in abundance, confirm crawling as their dominant mode of locomotion. Inferred presence of juvenile crawlers in the community suggests a probable shoreline or marginal marine ecospace...|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} of tracking may focus on, {{but is not}} limited to, the patterns and systems of the local animal life and ecology. Trackers {{must be able to}} recognize and follow animals through their tracks, signs, and trails, also known as spoor. Spoor may include tracks, scat, feathers, kills, scratching posts, trails, <b>drag</b> <b>marks,</b> sounds, scents, marking posts, the behavior of other animals, habitat cues, and any other clues about the identity and whereabouts of the quarry.|$|R
50|$|The Sinraptor dongi skull IVPP 10600 {{exhibits}} a lesion that fully penetrated the bone, gouges, punctures and <b>drag</b> <b>marks</b> {{left by the}} teeth of another dinosaur. One rib was broken and later healed by lengthening the shaft connecting it to its vertebra. The skull of the Acrocanthosaurus atokensis holotype shows some exostosis on the squamosal. Additionally, the neural spine of the eleventh vertebra was fractured and healed. The third tail vertebra bears a strange hook-shaped projection.|$|R
50|$|Local workers {{start to}} go {{missing in the}} Chamala Valley, plucked from the ground without any <b>drag</b> <b>marks,</b> blood or foot prints {{during the middle of}} the afternoon. Locals soon spread word that the Chamala Valley is haunted by an 'Evil One'. Anderson arrives in the valley to unravel this mystery and through some {{investigations}} he discovers a very interesting story about a local circus - which leads him to the reason why the man-eater kills during the day, and where it may be found.|$|R
50|$|Tyrannosaur tooth marks are {{the most}} {{commonly}} preserved feeding traces of carnivorous dinosaurs. It is usually not possible to identify tooth marks on bone made by small predatory dinosaurs due to similarities in the denticles on their teeth. However, there are exceptions, like an ornithomimid caudal vertebra that has tooth <b>drag</b> <b>marks</b> attributed to Saurornitholestes and a partial Troodon skeleton with preserved puncture marks. Small bones of small theropods that were preyed upon by larger ones may have been swallowed whole and digested frequently enough to affect their abundance in the fossil record.|$|R
5000|$|... in 1858 Hitchcock still {{described}} the tracks {{as those of}} [...] "a thick-toed bird," [...] {{since there was no}} evidence of tail <b>drag</b> <b>marks.</b> But by the time that Richard Swann Lull began working on the tracks in 1904, they were thought to belong to a dinosaur. Lull originally thought they were from a herbivore, but by 1953 he concluded they were from a carnivorous theropod. Many later authors have agreed with this interpretation, but some have suggested that they are from a prosauropod. Regardless, they are almost certainly saurischian.|$|R
50|$|Following {{an injury}} from a Gin trap, a cattle lifter turns man-eating tiger in Ramapuram. On {{following}} the <b>drag</b> <b>marks</b> {{of one of}} the live baits taken in the night, Anderson comes across a tigress and small cubs and is surprised when she does not charge. Anderson finds another one of his baits has been killed, and when he approaches the kill to examine it he is surprised by the man-eater who is still by the bullock. The man-eater's charge is hindered by the bulk of the dead bullock, giving Anderson time to make his shot.|$|R
50|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, FBI agents canvassed area service {{stations}} until one station owner reported his suspicions.

Though there {{did not seem to be}} any fishing equipment in the back but here were <b>drag</b> <b>marks</b> in the bed of the vehicle. The receipt for the towing had the signature of Michael Poland. Sure enough a search of boat rental receipts turned up one which had his name for a rental for a boat to Bonelli Landing, where the pickup had been towed.|$|R
50|$|Near Monticello is {{a dinosaur}} tracksite {{preserved}} in the Chinle Formation with nearby Indian petroglyphs. Between the years 700 and 1,000 the Fremont culture left petroglyphs of giant lizards up to six feet long next to a small one foot tall human figure at Cub Creek, {{not far from the}} Douglas/Carnegie bone beds of Dinosaur National Monument. These petroglyphs may have been inspired by the abundant local dinosaur bones and footprints. A sizable dinosaur tracksite is only 200 yards away. Alternatively, the lizard petroglyphs may have been inspired by fossil footprints of the ichnogenus Brachycheirotherium, which is sometimes accompanied by lizard-like tail <b>drag</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Edward Hitchcock erected the ichnogenus Bifurculapes, meaning [...] "two little forked feet," [...] for trace fossils {{that were}} {{discovered}} in the Early Jurassic Turners Falls Formation in the Deerfield Basin of Massachusetts. They are insect or crustacean trackways that consist of two rows of two to three tracks per series, with the two larger tracks being oriented parallel or oblique to the trackway axis. The third track, when present, is {{much smaller than the}} other two and is oriented approximately perpendicular to the trackway axis. Sometimes, medial <b>drag</b> <b>marks</b> are present between the track rows. In trace fossil classification schemes based on behavior, Bifurculapes is considered a repichnion, or locomotion trace.|$|R

5000|$|Groove casts are {{straight}} parallel ridges that are raised a few millimeters from the bedding surface.

Groove casts are closely spaced, but not on top of each other, and exist in pairs, triples, and even larger groups. Groove casts form when high velocity flows (e.g. turbidite) create a pattern on an underlying bed.

40|$|The Longguan dinosaur tracksite in the Sichuan Basin (China) is described. It {{is located}} in the {{uppermost}} part of the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation and displays a single, unusual trackway consisting of 19 deeply impressed pes im-prints. All tracks have suffered from erosion over many years of exposure, but they still reveal interesting details such as conspicuous elongated grooves, interpreted here as toe and claw <b>drag</b> <b>marks.</b> The trackmaker, a medium-sized archosaur, was walking in a thick and relatively soft layer of sand. The elongated, oval shape of the footprints resembles the ich-nogenus Eosauropus from North America and Europe, assigned to facultative bipedal sauropodomorphs. The Chinese track differs by inward rotation of the footprints toward the midline, whereas in Eosauropus, these are turned strictly outward. Other ichnotaxa and possible trackmakers are discussed, but presently, a distinct assignment cannot be given...|$|R
