5|$|As {{the two are}} {{otherwise}} unattested outside of Snorri's Prose Edda, suggestions have been made that Hjúki and Bil may have been of minor mythic significance, or that they were made up outright by Snorri, while Anne Holtsmark (1945) posits that Snorri may <b>have</b> <b>known</b> or had access to a now lost verse source wherein Hjúki and Bil personified the waxing and waning moon. Holtsmark further theorizes that Bil {{may have been a}} dís (a type of female deity).|$|E

5|$|Darmstadtium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Nine different isotopes of darmstadtium have been reported with atomic masses 267, 269–271, 273, 277, and 279–281, although darmstadtium-267 and darmstadtium-280 are unconfirmed. Two darmstadtium isotopes, darmstadtium-270 and darmstadtium-271, <b>have</b> <b>known</b> metastable states. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, but some undergo spontaneous fission.|$|E

5|$|Hassium has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Twelve different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 263 to 277 (with the exceptions of 272, 274, and 276), three of which, hassium-265, hassium-267, hassium-269, <b>have</b> <b>known</b> metastable states.

Shulgin performed seminal work into the descriptive synthesis of many of these compounds. Some of Shulgin's noteworthy discoveries include compounds of the 2C* family (such as 2C-B) and compounds of the DOx family (such as DOM).|$|E

He also said that Jackson did not have insomnia and never asked him for narcotics.
