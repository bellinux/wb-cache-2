60|$|It will {{be remembered}} that when the mysterious light fell upon us on the peak I had my compass with me and was able roughly to take its bearings. For lack of any better guide we now {{followed}} these bearings, travelling almost due north-east, for in that direction had shone the fire. All day in the most beautiful weather we marched across the flower-strewn desert, seeing nothing except bunches of game {{and one or two}} herds of wild asses which had come down from the mountains to feed upon the new grass. As evening approached we shot an antelope and made our camp--for we had brought the yak and a tent with us--among some tamarisk scrub, of which the dry stems furnished us with fuel. Nor did we lack for water, since by scraping in the sand soaked with melted snow, we found plenty of <b>fair</b> <b>quality.</b> So that night we supped in luxury upon tea and antelope meat, which indeed we were glad to have, as it spared our little store of dried provisions.|$|E

Competition among trade <b>fairs</b> for <b>quality</b> participants is increasingly intensive. If and how organizers can build up B 2 B customer loyalty becomes a key issue for competitive advantages of trade fairs. This paper aims to use relationship marketing theory to examine the adaption of the relationship quality concept in the trade fair sector in China. Altogether 33 semi-structured interviews were conducted in four major international trade fairs staged in Guangzhou and Beijing. Results indicate the perceptions of exhibitors regarding relationship orientation, organizer reliability and service quality, and how communication, service quality, trust and commitment contribute to trade <b>fair</b> relationship <b>quality.</b> By taking a qualitative approach to probe the perceptions of exhibitors, this paper is able to identify in-depth issues and problems.

The first yarn was of <b>fair</b> <b>quality,</b> but sales resistance was heavy, and silk associates worked zealously to discredit acetate and discourage its use. However, the thermoplastic nature of acetate made it an excellent fiber for moiré, because the pattern was permanent and did not wash away. The same characteristic also made permanent pleating a commercial fact for the first time, and gave great style impetus to the whole dress industry.|$|E

The 2009 assessment found that available food included sorghum, maize, meat, sugar, oil, salt and rice, cooked using firewood collected by the women. Insufficient rain was causing food insecurity.

5000|$|A {{key element}} was the easy {{availability}} of iron ore, coal, and manpower. Iron ore of <b>fair</b> <b>quality</b> was {{abundant in the}} eastern states, but the Lake Superior region contained huge deposits of exceedingly rich ore; the Marquette Iron Range was discovered in 1844; operations began in 1846. Other ranges were opened by 1910, including the Menominee, Gogebic, Vermilion, Cuyuna, and, greatest of all, (in 1892) the Mesabi range in Minnesota. This iron ore was shipped through the Lakes to ports such as Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, Erie and Buffalo for shipment by rail to the steel mills. [...] Abundant coal was available in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Manpower was short. Few Native Americans wanted {{to work in the}} mills, but immigrants from Britain and Germany (and later from Eastern Europe) arrived in great numbers.|$|E
