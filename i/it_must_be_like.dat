500|$|Alejandro González Iñárritu was {{initially}} {{expected to be}} appointed as director, but film commitments later forced him {{to pull out of}} the project. Pizzolatto instead approached Cary Joji Fukunaga, who he knew from Anonymous Content, to take up the task. Fukunaga spent time conducting research with a homicide detective of the Louisiana State Police's Criminal Investigations Division in preparation for his services. Based on the officer's own personal experiences, the director was able to develop [...] "a nice sense of what <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be a detective in Louisiana—especially in that time period in the '90s, which was pre-cell phone, and technology was about to change the way we all live our lives. That's what I did. I'm not a big serial killer studier—I've never analyzed books about that kind of stuff and I've never really watched procedurals. Those parts of the story were the least attractive to me; I was doing it mainly for the characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Provo of GameSpot {{reviewed}} the Wii Virtual Console release in 2007, citing the excellent graphics, sound, and general {{intensity of the}} game. He noted initial difficulty adjusting to the controls and game design. However, once accustomed, he said, [...] "you start totally feeling what <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be an army of one trading firepower {{with some of the}} universe's largest, most elaborate creatures. That's a great feeling." [...] Lucas M. Thomas of IGN noted the game's many similarities to Gunstar Heroes and recommended Alien Soldier to those who enjoyed it. [...] "Alien Soldier is a long-lost piece of Treasure's action gaming legacy," [...] said Thomas. [...] "It's got the fast-firing, high-energy, overly-explosive intensity that fans of the company have come to expect." [...] Darren Calvert of Nintendo Life described the graphics and animation as some of the best on the Mega Drive. He found the game difficult, but still enjoyable for fans of the run and gun genre. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer described the game as [...] "manically-paced" [...] and [...] "bizarrely creative" [...] while also providing a disclaimer that it's [...] "really hectic and difficult if you're not into this sort of thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quicksilver was {{originally}} {{presented as a}} mutant capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. Originally capable of running {{at the speed of}} sound, exposure to the High Evolutionary's Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at supersonic speeds of up to Mach 10 and resist the effects of friction, reduced oxygen, and kinetic impact while moving at super-speeds. Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human. The character's speed allows him to perform such feats as creating cyclone-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water. Pietro's mind can perceive information with a photographic memory short term, becoming faster than the speed of thought, because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material, and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants. It has been revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, [...] "Have you ever had a day where you are at the ATM and you are in a hurry because you're running late but the person in front of you doesn't know how to use the ATM and they're taking forever? Now imagine what <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to spend every day surrounded by people who don't know how to use the ATM." ...|$|E

50|$|Set in {{the year}} 2155 (2157 in some later versions), when {{children}} learn individually at home using a mechanical teacher, the story tells of eleven-year-old Margie Jones, whose neighbor Tommy finds a real book. The book tells about a time when children learned by age group in large schools that were not merely designated rooms in private houses as {{in the year}} 2157. Margie and Tommy discuss what <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have <b>been</b> <b>like</b> to study together with a real person as a teacher, and though at first Margie is skeptical about the notion, {{by the end of}} the story she daydreams about what <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have <b>been</b> <b>like</b> and 'the fun they had'.|$|R

6000|$|It was a truly dismal {{contrast}} to the fatness of the land they had been passing through, and the parson's voice issuing from bloodless lips, although complacent, was pathetic. It was peculiar, that voice of his, seeming to indicate an intimate acquaintanceship with what was fat and fine, to convey contempt for the vulgar need of money, while all the time his eyes--those watery, ascetic eyes--as plain as speech they said, [...] "Oh, to know what <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to have a pound or two to spare just once a year, or so!" ...|$|E

60|$|Indeed, I {{believe it}} is {{impossible}} for us to comprehend the source and nature of the Roman Catholic devotion. I once went into a church at Rome at the request of a Catholic friend, who described the interior to be so beautiful and glorious, that he thought (he said) <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> heaven itself. I found walls hung with cheap stripes of pink and white calico, altars covered with artificial flowers, a number of wax candles, and plenty of gilt-paper ornaments. The place seemed to me like a shabby theatre; and here was my friend on his knees at my side, plunged in a rapture of wonder and devotion.|$|E

To know and ordain and superintend exactly what silver and glass and table linen shall be used and set out on what occasions, to have cellar and pantry and plate-cupboard under a minutely devised and undeviating administration, to be noiseless, impalpable, omnipresent, and, as far as your own department is concerned, omniscient?” ...|$|E
60|$|Also I {{warned the}} Zulus through Umslopogaas and Goroko, that no mention {{was to be}} made of our adventures, either then or afterwards, since if this were done the curse of the White Queen would fall on them and bring them to {{disaster}} and death. I added that the name of this queen and everything that was connected with her, or her doings, must be locked up in their own hearts. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> the name of dead kings, not to be spoken. Nor indeed did they ever speak it or tell the story of our search, because they were too much afraid both of Ayesha whom they believed to be the greatest of all witches, and of the axe of their captain, Umslopogaas.|$|E

I'd just like to know how the judge makes up his mind. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> markin' China lottery tickets. He plays hunches. He looks at a guy an' waits for a spot or a number to come into his head. How else could he give Johnny Black four years an' Cal Hutchins twenty years?

60|$|People {{who have}} never gone to sea {{for the first time}} as sailors, can not imagine how puzzling and {{confounding}} it is. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> going into a barbarous country, where they speak a strange dialect, arid dress in strange clothes, and live in strange houses. For sailors have their own names, even for things that are familiar ashore; and if you call a thing by its shore name, you are laughed at for an ignoramus and a landlubber. This first day I speak of, the mate having ordered me to draw some water, I asked him where I was to get the pail; when I thought I had committed some dreadful crime; for he flew into a great passion, and said they never had any pails at sea, and then I learned that they were always called buckets. And once I was talking about sticking a little wooden peg into a bucket to stop a leak, when he flew out again, and said there were no pegs at sea, only plugs. And just so it was with every thing else.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{the cough}} cure," [...] {{explained}} Sproatly with a grin. [...] "I sold {{a man at}} Lander's one of the large-sized bottles, {{and when he had}} taken some he felt a good deal better. Then he seems to have argued the thing out like this: if one dose had relieved the cough, a dozen should drive it out of him altogether, and he took the lot. He slept for forty-eight hours afterward, and when I came across him at the settlement he attacked me with a club. The fault, I may point out, was in his logic. Perhaps you would like some pictures. I've a rather striking oleograph of the Kaiser. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> him, for two of his subjects recognized it. One hung it up in his shanty; the other asked me to hold it out, and then pitched a stove billet through the middle of it. He, however, produced his dollar; he said he felt so much better after what he'd done that he didn't grudge it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 3 stars.

6000|$|... 141. I was {{at first}} a little despondent about this; but, on the whole, I believe {{it will have a}} good effect upon our {{literature}} for some time to come; and then, perhaps, the public may recover its patience again. For certainly it is excellent discipline for an author to feel that he must say all he has to say in the fewest possible words, or his reader is sure to skip them; and in the plainest possible words, or his reader will certainly misunderstand them. Generally, also, a downright fact may be told in a plain way; and we want downright facts at present more than anything else. And though I often hear moral people complaining of the bad effects of want of thought, for my part, {{it seems to me that}} one of the worst diseases to which the human creature is liable is its disease of thinking. If it would only just look[19] at a thing instead of thinking what <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>like,</b> or do a thing instead of thinking it cannot be done, we should all get on far better.|$|E

He said: 'It {{is not so much the}} money, because there is always mine.' I could never do a thing he cannot bear, and take his money, and you would never let me. One knows very little of anything in the world till trouble comes.

We and the 4th make a troop together. We have drill in the afternoon, too, for a bit. Of a morning those that like can go across and have a look at the town. I went yesterday. Rum old place, isn't it? The rummiest thing is the way those little donkeys get about with a fat chap perched on the top of a saddle two feet above them. Never saw such mokes in my life. They ain't bigger than good-sized dogs some of them, and yet they go along with fifteen or sixteen stone on their backs as if they did not feel it. Those and the camels pleased me most.

50|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the talus pueblos were built on the south facing side of the mesas.
