2500|$|The {{luminance}} or {{brightness of}} a cloud {{is determined by}} how light is reflected, scattered, and transmitted by the cloud's particles. Its brightness may also {{be affected by the}} presence of haze or photometeors such as halos and rainbows. In the troposphere, dense, deep clouds exhibit a high reflectance (70% to 95%) throughout the visible spectrum. Tiny particles of water are densely packed and sunlight cannot penetrate far into the cloud before it is reflected out, giving a cloud its characteristic white color, especially when viewed from the top. Cloud droplets tend to scatter light efficiently, so that the intensity of the solar radiation decreases with depth into the gases. As a result, the cloud base can vary from a very light to very-dark-grey depending on the cloud's thickness and how much light is being reflected or transmitted back to the observer. [...] High thin tropospheric clouds reflect less light because of the comparatively low concentration of constituent ice crystals or supercooled water droplets which results in a slightly off-white appearance. [...] However, a thick dense <b>ice-crystal</b> <b>cloud</b> appears brilliant white with pronounced grey shading because of its greater reflectivity.|$|E
40|$|The {{extinction}} {{characteristics of}} thin <b>ice-crystal</b> <b>clouds</b> over the oceanic convective rain belts {{in the tropics}} and midlatitudes, obtained from the infrared interferometer spectrometer flown on Nimbus 4 satellite in 1970 are examined. It is observed that the optical depth of these clouds in the RF window region is less than 3 and their spectral features {{are consistent with the}} cloud particle size of about 10 micron. These optically-thin <b>ice-crystal</b> <b>clouds</b> are extensions of the anvil clouds generated by deep convective systems. The existence of such clouds extending from the upper troposphere into the lower stratosphere in the polar regions during winter and early spring is indicated, and the result of a theoretical simulation are analyzed...|$|R
2500|$|High-level genus-types {{particularly}} {{show this}} duality with both short-wave albedo cooling and long-wave greenhouse warming effects. [...] On the whole though, <b>ice-crystal</b> <b>clouds</b> {{in the upper}} troposphere tend to favor net warming. [...] However, the cooling effect is dominant with mid-level and low clouds made of very small water droplets with an average radius of about 2µm (0.00008in)., [...] especially when they form in extensive sheets that block out more of the sun. [...] Small-droplet aerosols are not good at absorbing long-wave radiation reflected back from Earth, {{so there is a}} net cooling with almost no long-wave effect. [...] This effect is particularly pronounced with low clouds that form over water. [...] Measurements taken by NASA indicate that on the whole, the effects of low and mid-level clouds that tend to promote cooling are outweighing the warming effects of high layers and the variable outcomes associated with or vertically developed clouds.|$|R
40|$|Sensitivity {{studies with}} global climate models show that, by their {{influence}} on the radiation balance, Antarctic clouds {{play a major role}} in the climate system, both directly at high southern latitudes and indirectly globally, as the local circulation changes lead to global teleconnections. Unfortunately, observations of cloud distribution in the Antarctic are limited and often of low quality because of the practical difficulty in observing clouds in the harsh Antarctic environment. The best surface observations suggest that the fractional cloud cover at the South Pole is around 50 - 60 % in all seasons, whereas the cloud cover rises to around 80 - 90 % close to the coast of the continent. Microphysical observations of cloud parameters are also very sparse in the Antarctic. However, the few measurements that do exist show predominantly <b>ice-crystal</b> <b>clouds</b> across the interior, with mixed-phase clouds close to the coasts. Crystal sizes vary from 5 to 30 mm (effective radius) in the interior to somewhat larger ice crystals and water drops near the coast. A wide range of crystal shapes is observed at all sites. This review considers the available cloud observations and highlights the importance of Antarctic clouds and the need for better observations in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{orientation}} of small anisotropic particles settling in a turbulent fluid determines some essential {{properties of the}} suspension. We show that the orientation distribution of small heavy spheroids settling through turbulence can be accurately predicted by a simple Gaussian statistical model {{that takes into account}} particle inertia and provides a quantitative understanding of the orientation distribution on the problem parameters when fluid inertia is negligible. Our results open the way to a parameterisation of the distribution of <b>ice-crystals</b> in <b>clouds,</b> and potentially leads to an improved understanding of radiation reflection, or particle aggregation through collisions in clouds.

40|$|Solar-J is a {{comprehensive}} radiative transfer model for the solar spectrum that addresses the needs of both solar heating and photochemistry in Earth system models. Solar-J is a spectral extension of Cloud-J, a standard in many chemical models that calculates photolysis rates in the 0. 18 – 0. 8  µm region. The Cloud-J core consists of an eight-stream scattering, plane-parallel radiative transfer solver with corrections for sphericity. Cloud-J uses cloud quadrature to accurately average over correlated cloud layers. It uses the scattering phase function of aerosols and clouds expanded to eighth order and thus avoids isotropic-equivalent approximations prevalent in most solar heating codes. The spectral extension from 0. 8 to 12  µm enables calculation of both scattered and absorbed sunlight and thus aerosol direct radiative effects and heating rates throughout the Earth's atmosphere. The Solar-J extension adopts the correlated-k gas absorption bins, primarily water vapor, from the shortwave Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for general circulation model (GCM) applications (RRTMG-SW). Solar-J successfully matches RRTMG-SW's tropospheric heating profile in a clear-sky, aerosol-free, tropical atmosphere. We compare both codes in cloudy atmospheres with a liquid-water stratus <b>cloud</b> and an <b>ice-crystal</b> cirrus <b>cloud.</b> For the stratus cloud, both models use the same physical properties, and we find a systematic low bias of about 3...|$|R
40|$|Infrared {{radiance}} {{measurements were}} acquired from a narrow-field nadir-viewing radiometer {{based on the}} NASA ER- 2 aircraft during a coincident Landsat 5 overpass on October 28, 1986 {{as part of the}} FIRE Cirrus IFO in the vicinity of Lake Michigan. The spectral bandpasses are 9. 90 - 10. 87 microns for the ER- 2 -based radiometer and 10. 40 - 12. 50 microns for the Landsat thematic mapper band. After adjusting for spatial and temporal differences, a comparative study using data from these two instruments is undertaken in order to retrieve cirrus <b>cloud</b> <b>ice-crystal</b> sizes and optical depths. Retrieval is achieved by analysis of measurement correlations between the two spectral bands and comparison to multistream radiative transfer model calculations. The results indicate that the equivalent sphere radii of the cirrus ice crystals were typically less than 30 microns. Such particles were too small to be measured by the available in situ instrumentation. Cloud optical depths at a reference wavelength of 11. 4 microns ranged from 0. 3 to 2. 0 for this case study. Supplemental results in support of this study are described using radiation measurements from the King Air aircraft, which was also in near coincidence with the Landsat overpass...|$|R
