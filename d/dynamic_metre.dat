50|$|The {{orchestration}} of {{the piece}} features a quartet of vocal soloists, a substantial chorus, and the full orchestra, and each at times is used in virtuosic, textural, and melodic capacities. The writing displays Beethoven's characteristic disregard for the performer, and is in several places both technically and physically exacting, with many sudden changes of <b>dynamic,</b> <b>metre</b> and tempo. This is consistent throughout, starting with the opening Kyrie where the syllables Ky-ri are delivered either forte or with sforzando, but the final e is piano. As noted above, the reprise of the Et vitam venturi fugue is particularly taxing, being both subtly different from the previous statements of the theme and counter-theme, and delivered at around twice the speed.|$|E

In 2004, she broke the female record in freediving with fins (<b>dynamic),</b> swimming 158 <b>metres</b> in 6m 39s. Nordblad also was the Finnish team captain and coach for the menâ€™s national freediving team, preparing them for the 2014 World cup in Italy.
