40|$|Most textile {{materials}} are used and {{touched by the}} human skin, in particular the hand. Traditionally, the quality and surface characteristics of apparel fabrics are evaluated by touching and feeling, leading to a subjective assessment. For this reason, the interaction with the human senses is an essential performance property. When touched by the human hand, friction {{is one of the}} first feelings and therefore friction coefficient is an important parameter. This paper describes a new patented laboratory instrument, which was investigated and designed at the University of Minho based on a different method of accessing friction coefficient of fabrics, as well as its fundamentals and working principle. This is followed by an experimental study, where a comparison between three different <b>double-faced</b> <b>fabrics</b> made with non-conventional fibre combinations was performed under controlled atmosphere. The tested materials are: 1) Polyester/Cotton – Soya fibre (PES/CO-SPF) 2) Polyester/Cotton – Corn fibre (PES/CO-PLA, Polylactic-acid) 3) Polyester/Cotton – Cotton (PES/CO-CO) The results of the experimental work are analysed using various tools, including SPSS 14. 0 statistical package and commented in the light of the influence of the raw material in the friction properties of the fabrics...|$|R
50|$|Large {{stocks of}} post-war {{military}} surplus coats available {{at reasonable prices}} {{to the general public}} meant that these coats became a ubiquitous and popular item of clothing in the 1950s and 1960s especially among students. The British firm Gloverall purchased surplus military supply of coats after World War II, and in 1954 started producing their own version of the Duffle coat using leather fastenings and buffalo horn toggles with a <b>double-faced</b> check back <b>fabric,</b> and many other modern versions copy some or all of those features.|$|R
