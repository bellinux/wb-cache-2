25|$|In 1876, Nikolaus Otto {{patented}} the Otto cycle engine. It was a <b>four-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> gas {{internal combustion}} engine with intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes. one of Otto's more than 25 patents on this engine was later challenged and overturned {{in order to allow}} Daimler and Maybach to produce their high speed engine.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, Otto {{developed}} a gaseous fuel, compressed charge <b>four-stroke</b> <b>cycle,</b> (also {{known as the}} Otto Cycle) engine after 14 years of effort, a system characterized by four piston strokes (intake, compression, power, and exhaust). Otto intended that his invention would replace the steam engines predominant in those years, even though his engine was still primitive and inefficient.|$|E
25|$|A {{four-stroke}} cylinder {{produces a}} power stroke only every other {{rotation of the}} crankshaft, with three strokes being pumping losses. This doubles the real surface-to-volume ratio for the four-stroke reciprocating piston engine and the displacement increased. The Wankel, therefore, has higher volumetric efficiency and lower pumping losses through the absence of choking valves. Because of the quasi-overlap of the power strokes, that cause the smoothness of the engine and the avoidance of the <b>four-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> in a reciprocating engine, the Wankel engine is very quick to react to power increases, giving a quick delivery of power when the demand arises, especially at higher rpm's. This difference is more pronounced when compared to four-cylinder reciprocating engines and less pronounced when compared to higher cylinder counts.|$|E
50|$|An engine {{capable of}} {{switching}} between two-stroke and <b>four-stroke</b> <b>cycles</b> {{is the result}} of a collaboration between Ricardo, Denso, Jaguar Land-Rover and the Centre for Automotive Engineering at the University of Brighton. The engine is claimed to improve fuel economy by up to 25%.|$|R
50|$|Two stroke engines rely on {{effective}} scavenging {{in order}} to operate correctly. This clears out the combustion exhaust gases from the previous cycle and allows refilling with a clean mix of air and fuel. If scavenging falters, the mixture of unburnable exhaust gas with the new mixture may produce an overall charge that fails to ignite correctly. Only when this charge is enriched by a second volume of clean mixture does it become flammable again. The engine thus begins to fire every second cycle (every four strokes), rather than correctly on every <b>cycle.</b> <b>Four-stroking</b> begins gradually, so the engine first starts to run with an unpredictable mixture of two- and <b>four-stroke</b> <b>cycles.</b> When severe, this may even become six- or eight-stroking.|$|R

50|$|Diesel engines may be {{designed}} as either two-stroke or <b>four-stroke</b> <b>cycles.</b> They were originally {{used as a}} more efficient replacement for stationary steam engines. Since the 1910s they {{have been used in}} submarines and ships. Use in locomotives, trucks, heavy equipment and electricity generation plants followed later. In the 1930s, they slowly began to be used in a few automobiles. Since the 1970s, the use of diesel engines in larger on-road and off-road vehicles in the US increased. According to the British Society of Motor Manufacturing and Traders, the EU average for diesel cars accounts for 50% of the total sold, including 70% in France and 38% in the UK.|$|R

50|$|Note {{that all}} three engines operate on the {{two-stroke}} cycle, as did most early engines (the competition was steam engines, which also operate on the two-stroke cycle, and are usually double acting so every stroke is a power stroke). It was a remarkable leap to discover that, for internal combustion engines, the <b>four-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> with three non-power strokes could deliver both economy and performance, see Alphonse Beau de Rochas who patented the idea in 1861, and Otto who made commercial engines using the <b>four-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> after his earlier work with atmospheric engines. All three of Barnett's engines were vertical engines with a layout similar to steam table engines.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Atkinson cycle {{piston engine}} allowed the intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes of the <b>four-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> {{to occur in}} a single turn of the crankshaft and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto cycle engines.|$|E

50|$|Many {{two-stroke}} cycle and all wankel engines {{do not have}} a camshaft or valves, and the port timing can only be varied by machining the ports, and/or modifying the piston skirt (two stroke applications). However, some supercharged two-stroke diesel engines (such as the Wilksch aero-engine) do have a cylinder head and poppet valves, similar to a <b>four-stroke</b> <b>cycle</b> engine.|$|E

50|$|The six-stroke {{engine was}} invented in 1883. Four kinds of six-stroke use a regular piston in a regular {{cylinder}} (Griffin six-stroke, Bajulaz six-stroke, Velozeta six-stroke and Crower six-stroke), firing every three crankshaft revolutions. The systems capture the wasted heat of the <b>four-stroke</b> Otto <b>cycle</b> with an injection of air or water.|$|R
50|$|Most {{truck and}} {{automotive}} diesel engines use a cycle {{reminiscent of a}} <b>four-stroke</b> <b>cycle,</b> but with a compression heating ignition system, rather than needing a separate ignition system. This variation is called the diesel cycle. In the diesel cycle, diesel fuel is injected directly into the cylinder so that combustion occurs at constant pressure, as the piston moves.|$|E
50|$|It is {{typically}} {{connected to a}} flywheel to reduce the pulsation characteristic of the <b>four-stroke</b> <b>cycle,</b> and sometimes a torsional or vibrational damper at the opposite end, to reduce the torsional vibrations often caused {{along the length of}} the crankshaft by the cylinders farthest from the output end acting on the torsional elasticity of the metal.|$|E
