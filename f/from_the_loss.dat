5|$|Onassis's {{death had}} a {{profound}} effect on his father, who never fully recovered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of his son. Aristotle Onassis sought to sell Olympic Airways after his son's death, and died two years later in March 1975. Onassis was buried alongside his son on Skorpios.|$|E

5|$|The use of Lim-Flex and Brahmousin sires {{over a third}} {{breed of}} cow would benefit most from {{increased}} hybrid vigour, which should minimise any reduction in carcase value arising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of the F94L mutation.|$|E
50|$|In 1959 Rookwood was {{purchased}} by the Herschede Clock Company, and production moved to Starkville, Mississippi. Unable to recover <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> experienced during <b>the</b> Great Depression, production ceased in 1967.|$|R

5|$|After the Florida loss, Alabama's senior {{starting}} quarterback, John David Phillips, {{was replaced}} by freshman Andrew Zow. With Zow as the new starter, Alabama proceeded to win its next two games: 2017 against Ole Miss and 2322 against East Carolina. On October 24, Zow endured his first loss as the team's starting quarterback when Alabama was defeated, 3518, by eventual SEC (and national) champion Tennessee. Alabama rebounded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> by reeling off two more wins: 3020 against Southern Miss and an upset 2216 win over LSU, in which the Crimson Tide scored 15 points in 144 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} approaches towards education {{meant that it}} was no longer regarded adequate for a child to leave education aged 14, as that is the age when they were seen to really understand and appreciate the value of education, as well as being the period when adolescence was at its height. It was beginning to be seen as the worst age for a sudden switch from education to employment, with around 80% of children in 1938 leaving education at this age, many having only had primary-school level education. Although there were concerns about the effects of having less labour from these children, it was hoped that the outcome of a larger quantity of more qualified, skilled workers would eliminate the deficit problem <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of unskilled labour.|$|E
5|$|During her {{tenure in}} office, she {{presided over the}} {{handover}} of the Panama Canal from the US to Panama and the economic downturn that resulted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of US personnel. Hobbled by new spending restrictions passed by the opposition-controlled Legislative Assembly, and her administration's corruption scandals, she had difficulty passing her legislative initiatives. Her popularity declined, and her party's candidate José Miguel Alemán lost to the PRD's Torrijos in the subsequent general elections to succeed her.|$|E

5|$|For {{its opening}} game, Florida State faced the lightly {{regarded}} Samford Bulldogs and defeated them 59–6. In its second game, No.17 Florida State faced a tougher challenge as it traveled to Norman, Oklahoma {{to play the}} No.10-ranked Oklahoma Sooners. The Seminoles were defeated 47–17, in their third-worst loss since 1991. Florida State rebounded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> to defeat Brigham Young University, 34–10, then opened the ACC season by defeating Wake Forest, Virginia, in-state rival Miami and Boston College in succession.|$|E
5|$|Hit points (HP) are {{a measure}} of a character's {{vitality}} and health and {{are determined by the}} class, level and constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game. Death can also result <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to deceiving the French, the Rwandan government used the fake attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for launching {{a wave of}} anti-Tutsi propaganda. They encouraged Hutu citizens to arrest Tutsi suspected of supporting the RPF. With French assistance, and benefiting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the FAR enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF, and pushed the rebels {{all the way back}} to the Ugandan border. Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda, while others went into hiding in the Akagera National Park. The Rwandan government announced on 30 October that the war was over.|$|E

5|$|In its seventh game, Tech {{suffered}} {{its first}} loss. Traveling to Morgantown, West Virginia, home of West Virginia University, the third-ranked Hokies lost 28–7 to the No. 23 Mountaineers. The loss was Tech's worst since November 2001, and knocked the previously undefeated Hokies out of contention {{for the national}} championship. The Hokies returned home to face another high-ranking opponent, No.2 Miami. Recovering <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> against West Virginia, the Hokies delivered one of the highest-profile wins in school history, defeating the second-ranked Hurricanes 31–7. The game ended a 39-game regular-season winning streak by Miami and was Tech's first victory over a top-eight team in 34games.|$|E
5|$|In the Bears' {{first game}} of the season, California {{traveled}} to Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, to face No. 10 Kansas State for the 2003 BCA Classic. There, California lost 42–28 in the season opener for both teams. California recovered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> in its next game, outscoring the visiting Southern Miss Golden Eagles 34–2. Despite the Bears' success against Southern Miss, they struggled in their next two games, losing to both Colorado State and Utah. Traveling to the Midwest to face Big 10 opponent Illinois, California debuted a new quarterback: Aaron Rodgers. Rodgers had success late in California's game against Utah, but did not earn the win. Against Illinois, however, he orchestrated a California offense that emerged victorious, 31–24.|$|E
5|$|In their ninth {{game of the}} season, the Tar Heels lost to No. 2 Florida State, 203. The {{loss was}} the sole losing effort for the Tar Heels in the 1997 season, and came {{at the hands of}} the {{eventual}} Atlantic Coast champion Seminoles. During the game, the Tar Heels also lost their then-starting quarterback, Oscar Davenport, to a broken ankle. North Carolina recovered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> to win its final two games: 1710 against Clemson, and 5014 over Duke. Despite having only one loss, the Tar Heels were denied a chance to participate in a Bowl Alliance game and instead accepted a bid to the 1998 Gator Bowl.|$|E

50|$|The {{destruction}} of Lower Manhattan office space accelerated the pre-2001 trend of moving jobs from Lower Manhattan to Midtown and New Jersey.

5|$|On 8 June 1943, Mutsu was moored at Hashirajima {{when the}} {{magazine}} of her No. 3 turret exploded at 12:13, cutting {{the ship in}} half. The forward section capsized almost immediately, but the rear section remained afloat until the early morning of the next day. Nearby ships were able to rescue 353 survivors from the 1,474 crew members and visitors aboard Mutsu, meaning that 1,121 men {{were killed in the}} explosion. To avert the potential damage to morale <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of a battleship, Mutsus loss was declared a state secret. To further prevent rumors from spreading, many survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The average Soviet soldier {{suffered}} from inexperience. With the Soviet debacle {{of the previous}} year ameliorated only by the barest victory at Moscow, most of the original manpower of the Red Army had been killed, wounded or captured by the Germans, with casualties of almost 1,000,000 just from the Battle of Moscow. The typical soldier in the Red Army was a conscript and had little to no combat experience, and tactical training was practically nonexistent. Coupled with the lack of trained soldiers, the Red Army also began to suffer <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of Soviet industrial areas, and a temporary strategic defense was considered necessary.|$|E
5|$|The bad omens of {{the preseason}} were {{discarded}} in the Seminoles' {{first two games}} of the season: a 5513 win against Duke and a 297 victory over Alabama-Birmingham. In their third game of the season, however, Florida State suffered {{what was then the}} worst defeat in its history of play {{as a member of the}} Atlantic Coast Conference, a 419 loss to North Carolina. Florida State recovered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> by beating Wake Forest, 4824, but lost to No. 2 Miami in the following week, 4927.|$|E

5|$|The novels {{take place}} on the fantasy world of Krynn, created {{specifically}} for the gameplay. The world once worshiped the True Gods, a pantheon unique to the Dragonlance saga, but has come to believe that the True Gods have abandoned the world and those in it. The world is just starting to recover <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of the True Gods and a group has sprung up seeking to replace the True Gods (the Seekers). The main focus of the novels is the continent Ansalon and the characters Tanis Half-Elven, Sturm Brightblade, Caramon Majere, Raistlin Majere, Flint Fireforge, Tasslehoff Burrfoot, Goldmoon, and Riverwind.|$|E
5|$|The team rebounded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss,</b> as backup goaltender Henrik Karlsson led the Flames to a 7–4 {{victory over}} the Dallas Stars on January 21. Kiprusoff then showed a return to form by making 41 saves to lead the Flames to a 4–3 shootout win over Vancouver the {{following}} night. Victories over the Nashville Predators and St. Louis Blues allowed the Flames to enter the All-Star break on a four-game winning streak. Posting a 10–3–3 record in the 16 games {{leading up to the}} break, the Flames had pulled themselves to within two points of the eighth and final playoff spot in the West, and stood six points shy of fourth in the conference.|$|E
5|$|After the explosion, as {{the rescue}} {{operations}} commenced, the fleet was alerted {{and the area}} was searched for Allied submarines, but no traces were found. To avert the potential damage to morale <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of a battleship so soon after the string of recent setbacks in the war effort, Mutsus destruction was declared a state secret. Mass cremations of recovered bodies began almost immediately after the sinking. Captain Teruhiko Miyoshi's body was recovered by divers on 17 June, but his wife was not officially notified until 6 January 1944. Both he and his second in command, Captain Ono Koro, were posthumously promoted to rear admiral, as was normal practice. To further prevent rumours from spreading, healthy and recovered survivors were reassigned to various garrisons in the Pacific Ocean. Some of the survivors were sent to Truk in the Caroline Islands and assigned to the 41st Guard Force. Another 150 were sent to Saipan in the Mariana Islands, where most were killed in 1944 during {{the battle for the}} island.|$|E
5|$|In 1664 {{the mill}} {{partially}} burned down.

In 1764 another fire destroyed the entire mill, according to an ordenance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> States General after the miller requested assistance. The mill was rebuilt {{with the addition of a}} second water wheel. The larger building was a gristmill and the smaller building an oil mill. In 1909 a sawmill was added to the larger building, and for a period the smaller building also acted as a fulling mill.|$|R
