25|$|January 27, 2000: After its {{tailplane}} <b>deicing</b> <b>system</b> failed {{during the}} landing approach, a Misubishi MU-300 business jet, registration number N900WJ, touched down on Runway 31R at higher-than-normal speed as recommended {{for such a}} situation. When it became evident that the aircraft was going to overrun the runway due to the high speed and poor braking action on the slush-covered pavement, the pilot purposely steered the jet into an embankment to avoid striking light poles past {{the far end of}} the runway. There were no injuries to the four passengers or two crew, but the aircraft was written off.|$|E
25|$|Gardermoen has had {{considerable}} problems with fog and freezing rain, and has several times had a complete close-down. This {{was also a}} problem at Fornebu, and reported to be at Hurum as well. On average there is super cooled rain three times per month during the winter. The use of deicing fluids is restricted since the area underneath the airport contains the Tandrum Delta, one of the country's largest uncontained quaternary aquifers (underground water systems). On 14 December 1998, a combination of freezing fog and supercooled rain caused glaze at Gardermoen. At least twenty aircraft engines were damaged by ice during take-off, and five aircraft needed to make precautionary landings with only one working engine. On 18 January 2006, an Infratek <b>deicing</b> <b>system</b> was set up, that uses infrared heat in large hangar tents. It was hoped that it could reduce chemical deicers by 90%, but the technique has proved unsuccessful.|$|E

Data was obtained from low power ice protection systems tests conducted in the Icing Research Tunnel at NASA Lewis Research Center (LeRC) with nine different <b>deicing</b> <b>systems.</b> Results show that roughness associated with residual ice is not characterized by uniformly distributed roughness. Results also show that <b>deicing</b> <b>systems</b> require {{a critical mass of}} ice to generate a sufficient expelling force to remove the ice...|$|R
40|$|Protection systems against ice on {{leading edge}} {{conventionally}} use thermal and pneumatic solutions.

Numerical simulations allow computing the configurations that lead to low-consumption, compact ultrasonic deicing devices. First tests of piezoelectric de-icing systems are performed on simple cases such as plates.

25|$|Configured with 85 seats, {{the cabin}} was spacious and {{well-appointed}} with comfortable seats widely spaced, giving plenty of legroom, {{but due to}} the low cabin floor and wide diameter, there was much unusable space which limited baggage and cargo volume. The inefficient use of cabin volume contributed greatly to the low payload/TOW ratio which was much {{lower than that of}} the contemporary Ilyushin Il-18, but which was still higher than the Tupolev Tu-104. A later production version, the An-10A, addressed some of the efficiency concerns by increasing the number of seats from 85 to 89 and 100 (in the two versions of the An-10A), then to 117–118 and finally 132 through reducing seat pitch and changing the cabin layout. Powered by Ivchenko AI-20K engines the An-10A demonstrated superior performance and an increased maximum payload of 14.5 Tonnes (31,970lb). The auxiliary endplate fins eventually gave way to improved splayed ventral fins under the rear fuselage. The directional stability was now acceptable and the new ventral fins also improved longitudinal stability at high g and on landing approach, as well as delaying the onset of Mach buffet to M0.702. Due to being sited in an area of flow separation, the new ventral fins also caused unpleasant vibrations. Following results of flight tests and at least two fatal crashes, an effective tailplane <b>deicing</b> <b>system</b> was retrofitted to all remaining aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated <b>deicing</b> <b>systems</b> {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|R

Thermawing allows pilots to safely fly through ice encounters and provides pilots of single-engine aircraft the heated wing technology usually reserved for larger, jet-powered craft. Thermacool, an electric air conditioning system, uses a new compressor whose rotary pump design runs off an energy-efficient, brushless DC motor and allows pilots to use the air conditioner before the engine starts.|$|E

50|$|The {{climate in}} Maine results in severe icing of the antenna wires during the winter, {{resulting}} in unacceptably large loads on the supporting structures. Therefore the antennas have a <b>deicing</b> <b>system</b> which runs large 60 Hz electric currents through the wires, heating them, to melt the ice. The power required for deicing is 3 MW, {{higher than the}} transmitter output power. An antenna array cannot transmit while it is being deiced, and one reason for having two arrays was to allow one array to be deiced while the other provides crucial uninterrupted transmission capability. Repairs and adjustments to an array can also be made without interrupting transmission.|$|E

50|$|Freezing rain is {{considered}} to be an extreme hazard to aircraft, as it causes very rapid structural icing. Most helicopters and small airplanes lack the necessary deicing equipment to fly in freezing rain of any intensity, and heavy freezing rain can overwhelm even the most sophisticated <b>deicing</b> <b>systems</b> on large airplanes. Icing can increase an aircraft's weight but not typically enough to cause a hazard. The main danger comes from the ice changing the shape of its airfoils. This will reduce lift and increase drag. All three factors increase stalling speed and reduce aircraft performance, making it very difficult to climb or even maintain level altitude.|$|R
