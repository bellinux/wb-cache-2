25|$|The {{purchase}} of lottery tickets cannot {{be accounted for}} by decision models based on expected value maximization. The reason is that lottery tickets cost more than the expected gain, as shown by lottery mathematics, so someone maximizing expected value should not buy lottery tickets. Yet, lottery purchases can be explained by decision models based on expected utility maximization, as the curvature of the utility function can be adjusted to capture risk-seeking behavior. More general models based on utility functions defined on things other than the lottery outcomes can also account for lottery purchase. In addition to the lottery prizes, the ticket may enable some purchasers to experience a thrill and to indulge in a fantasy of becoming wealthy. If the entertainment value (or other non-monetary value) obtained by playing is high enough for a given individual, then the {{purchase of}} a lottery ticket could represent a gain in overall utility. In such a case, the <b>disutility</b> of a monetary loss could be outweighed by the combined expected utility of monetary and non-monetary gain, thus making the purchase a rational decision for that individual.|$|E

40|$|Post-Fordist {{urban growth}} is characterised by {{ever-increasing}} dispersal and polycentricity. The transformation of urban spatial structure has profound implications for sustainable development. There {{is now a}} substantial literature both on confirming the existence of polycentricity through equilibrium and evolutionary theories and on empirical identification of subcentres. However, {{more research is needed}} to explore the generically polycentric urban growth. A microscopic simulation approach is thus applied to study how stable subcentres, measured in terms of population density, can be established. In this study, an experiment carried out in an artificial cellular city is reported. One innovative feature of this simulation is that the state of the cellular automaton comprises a quantity variable (population density) as well as a binary state variable (selected or not selected). The two are interlinked through the evolution of the city. The experiment suggests that the combined forces of accumulative population density and local interactions can lead to the formation of stable subcentres. In such a regime, subcentres are first established through stochastic 'errors', for example, clusters of local developments. Thereafter the clusters continue to capture development opportunities through reinforced local interactions. With the evolution, however, <b>disutilities,</b> such as congestion, are accumulated from the concentration of local development. The growth of <b>disutilities</b> changes the relative attractiveness between formed (sub) centres and other areas. When significant <b>disutilities</b> are accumulated, another stochastic change may overturn the dominance of (sub) centres and drive developments to other locations. The subcentre formation is validated under the general discussion of 'goodness of fit' of possible urban automata, and population density surfaces are measured through various 'signatures'. ...|$|R

60|$|In {{the face}} of such {{economic}} pressure as this, it is silly to expect that medical teaching, any more than medical practice, can possibly be scientific. The test to which all methods of treatment are finally brought is whether they are lucrative to doctors or not. It would be difficult to cite any proposition less obnoxious to science, than that advanced by Hahnemann: to wit, that drugs which in large doses produce certain symptoms, counteract them in very small doses, just as in more modern practice it is found that a sufficiently small inoculation with typhoid rallies our powers to resist the disease instead of prostrating us with it. But Hahnemann and his followers were frantically persecuted for a century by generations of apothecary-doctors whose incomes depended on the quantity of drugs they could induce their patients to swallow. These two cases of ordinary vaccination and homeopathy are typical of all the rest. Just as the object of a trade union under existing conditions must finally be, not to improve the technical quality of the work done by its members, but to secure a living wage for them, so the object of the medical profession today is to secure an income for the private doctor; and to this consideration all concern for science and public health must give way when the two come into conflict. Fortunately they are not always in conflict. Up to a certain point doctors, like carpenters and masons, must earn their living by doing the work that the public wants from them; and as it is not in the nature of things possible that such public want should be based on unmixed <b>disutility,</b> it may be admitted that doctors have their uses, real as well as imaginary. But just as the best carpenter or mason will resist the introduction of a machine that is likely to throw him out of work, or the public technical education of unskilled laborers' sons to compete with him, so the doctor will resist with all his powers of persecution every advance of science that threatens his income. And as the advance of scientific hygiene tends to make the private doctor's visits rarer, and the public inspector's frequenter, whilst the advance of scientific therapeutics is in the direction of treatments that involve highly organized laboratories, hospitals, and public institutions generally, it unluckily happens that the organization of private practitioners which we call the medical profession is coming more and more to represent, not science, but desperate and embittered antiscience: a statement of things which is likely to get worse until the average doctor either depends upon or hopes for an appointment in the public health service for his livelihood.|$|E

40|$|A new {{methodology}} for {{the estimation of}} social values of urban air pollution for project appraisal is proposed. This is performed by using individual perceptions (marginal <b>disutilities)</b> {{of those who are}} directly affected by this externality, which are then transformed into social values using the social welfare approach developed by Galvez and Jara-Diaz in 1998. The approach also unveils the implicit social bias behind the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay measures. The method is illustrated using individual perceptions obtained from stated preference experiments within the context of residential location including three attributes: an objective measure of air pollution by zone of the city, an index of family accessibility to work and study, and the monthly rent. Discrete residential choice models were estimated by income group, from which indirect utility functions were obtained. Marginal <b>disutilities</b> were used to obtain social values of air pollution for each income group by means of the calculation of a social utility of money. The methodological underpinnings and difficulties of the approach are specially highlighted. The need to establish a national programme for the estimation of social values is emphasized...|$|R

In total, they distinguish among 16 kinds of negative utilitarianism. They first distinguish between strong negativism and weak negativism. Strong negativism [...] "give all weight to disutility" [...] and weak negativism [...] "give some weight to positive utility, but more weight to disutility." [...] The most commonly discussed subtypes are probably two versions of weak negative utilitarianism called 'lexical' and 'lexical threshold' negative utilitarianism. According to 'lexical' negative utilitarianism, positive utility gets weight only when outcomes are equal with respect to <b>disutility.</b> That is, positive utility functions as a tiebreaker in that it determines which outcome is better (or less bad) when the outcomes considered have equal <b>disutility.</b> 'Lexical threshold' negative utilitarianism says {{that there is some}} <b>disutility,</b> for instance some extreme suffering, such that no positive utility can counterbalance it. 'Consent-based' negative utilitarianism is a specification of lexical threshold negative utilitarianism, which specifies where the threshold should be located.

40|$|When {{utilities}} are additive, we uncovered {{in our previous}} paper (Bogomolnaia et al. "Dividing Goods or Bads under Additive Utilities") many similarities but also surprising differences {{in the behavior of}} the familiar Competitive rule (with equal incomes), when we divide (private) goods or bads. The rule picks in both cases the critical points of the product of utilities (or <b>disutilities)</b> on the efficiency frontier, but there is only one such point if we share goods, while there can be exponentially many in the case of bads. We extend this analysis to the fair division of mixed items: each item can be viewed by some participants as a good and by others as a bad, with corresponding positive or negative marginal utilities. We find that the division of mixed items boils down, normatively as well as computationally, to a variant of an all goods problem, or of an all bads problem: in particular the task of dividing the non disposable items must be either good news for everyone, or bad news for everyone. If at least one feasible utility profile is positive, the Competitive rule picks the unique maximum of the product of (positive) utilities. If no feasible utility profile is positive, this rule picks all critical points of the product of <b>disutilities</b> on the efficient frontier. Comment: 14 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

While DTA is gradually maturing, many aspects of DTA still need improvements, especially regarding its formulation and solution capabilities under the transportation environment impacted by the Advanced Transportation Management and Information Systems (ATMIS). It is necessary to develop a set of DTA models to acknowledge {{the fact that the}} traffic network itself is probabilistic and uncertain, and different classes of travelers respond differently under uncertain environment, given different levels of traffic information. This paper aims to advance the state-of-the-art in DTA modeling {{in the sense that the}} proposed model captures the travelers(tm) decision making among discrete choices in a probabilistic and uncertain environment, in which both probabilistic travel times and random perception errors that are specific to individual travelers, are considered. Travelers(tm) route choices are assumed to be made with the objective of minimizing perceived <b>disutilities</b> at each time. These perceived <b>disutilities</b> depend on the distribution of the variable route travel times, the distribution of individual perception errors and the individual traveler(tm) s risk taking nature at each time instant.

Experimental results are also given to verify the correctness of solutions obtained. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective: Fabry {{disease is}} a rare {{inherited}} lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of α-galactosidase A. Effective enzyme replacement therapies are available that are administered intravenously. However, a new oral treatment is being developed as an alternative option for patients with amenable mutations. This {{study was designed to}} understand the value that people place on the different features of treatments for Fabry disease. Research design and methods: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was designed to assess the importance of different aspects of treatments for Fabry disease. The attributes included overall survival, mode of administration, treatment related reactions, treatment related headaches and risk of antibody formation. Attributes were combined using a published orthogonal array into choice sets. A research panel was used to survey the UK general public. The mixed logit model was used to estimate strength of preference for the attributes and marginal rates of substitution (MRSs). <b>Disutilities</b> were estimated from the DCE data for changes in each attribute. Results: The sample (n[*]=[*] 506) was broadly representative of UK demographics. The logit model revealed that all attributes were significant predictors of choice. Participants {{were significantly more likely to}} choose a treatment which meant an increase in their life expectancy by 1 year (odds ratio = 1. 574; 95 % CI = 1. 504 – 1. 647) and significantly less likely to choose self-administered intravenous (IV) treatment compared to an every other day tablet (OR = 0. 426 95 % CI = 0. 384 – 0. 474). Estimated <b>disutilities</b> were − 0. 0543 (self-administered infusion), treatment related headaches 12 times a year (− 0. 0361) and infusion reactions six times a year (− 0. 0202). Conclusions: The survey revealed a significant preference for oral treatment compared with IV even in the context of a treatment that can extend overall survival. MRSs were used as a basis for estimating <b>disutilities</b> associated with changes in attribute levels which could be used to weight QALYs. It is possible that other important treatment attributes are missing from this research which may have provided further insights.

40|$|Background. A common {{feature of}} studies that have {{compiled}} lists or catalogues of preference-based health-related quality-of-life weights for inclusion within quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) is their focus upon adult populations. More generally, utility measurement in or on behalf of children has been constrained {{by a number of}} methodological concerns. Objective. To augment previous catalogues of preference-based health-related quality-of-life weights by estimating preference-based Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI 3) multiattribute utility scores associated {{with a wide range of}} childhood conditions. Methods. Data for 2236 children from the ``Disability Survey 2000 : Survey of Young People With a Disability and Sport'' formed the basis of this investigation. Ordinary least squares (OLS), Tobit, and censored least absolute deviations (CLAD) regression methods were used to estimate adjusted marginal <b>disutilities</b> for each condition from 2 thresholds: 1) a threshold of 1. 0 representing perfect health and 2) a normative childhood utility threshold. Results. Prespecified statistical tests indicated a preference for the OLS regression model over the Tobit and CLAD models. The unadjusted mean, median, 25 th percentile and 75 th percentile HUI 3 multiattribute utility scores and adjusted marginal <b>disutilities</b> are presented for 43 conditions. Notably, based on the OLS estimator, the adjusted marginal <b>disutilities</b> for hydrocephalus; learning and physical disabilities; other syndromes and associations; meningitis, encephalitis, and other infections of the central nervous system; and microcephaly were estimated at — 0. 889 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: — 0. 727, — 1. 000), — 0. 858 (95 % CI: — 0. 727, — 0. 989), — 0. 838 (95 % CI: — 0. 668, — 1. 000), — 0. 826 (95 % CI: — 0. 677, — 0. 975), and — 0. 820 (95 % CI: — 0. 670, — 0. 970), respectively, when a perfect health threshold was applied, and — 0. 814 (95 % CI: — 0. 656, — 0. 979), — 0. 783 (95 % CI: — 0. 656, — 0. 918), — 0. 763 (95 % CI: — 0. 597, — 0. 937), — 0. 751 (95 % CI: — 0. 606, — 0. 904), and — 0. 745 (95 % CI: — 0. 598, — 0. 899), respectively, when a normative childhood utility threshold was applied.

40|$|A mixed manna {{contains}} goods (that everyone likes), bads (that everyone dislikes), {{as well as}} {{items that}} are goods to some agents, but bads or satiated to others. If all items are goods and utility functions are homothetic, concave (and monotone), the Competitive Equilibrium with Equal Incomes maximizes the Nash product of utilities: hence it is welfarist (determined utility-wise by the feasible set of profiles), single-valued and easy to compute. We generalize the Gale-Eisenberg Theorem to a mixed manna. The Competitive division is still welfarist and related to the product of utilities or <b>disutilities.</b> If the zero utility profile (before any manna) is Pareto dominated, the competitive profile is unique and still maximizes the product of utilities. If the zero profile is unfeasible, the competitive profiles are the critical points of the product of <b>disutilities</b> on the efficiency frontier, and multiplicity is pervasive. In particular the task of dividing a mixed manna is either good news for everyone, or bad news for everyone. We refine our results in the practically important case of linear preferences, where the axiomatic comparison between the division of goods and that of bads is especially sharp. When we divide goods and the manna improves, everyone weakly benefits under the competitive rule; but no reasonable rule to divide bads can be similarly Resource Monotonic. Also, the much larger set of Non Envious and Efficient divisions of bads can be disconnected {{so that it will}} admit no continuous selection.
