Collins eventually withdrew her request and submitted a continuation budget instead. Some education proposals advocated by Collins were passed, including mandatory kindergarten, remedial programs for <b>elementary</b> <b>school</b> <b>children,</b> mandatory testing and internship for teachers, and the implementation of academic receivership for underperforming schools. Among the other accomplishments of the 1984 legislative session were passage of a tougher drunk driving law, and a measure allowing state banking companies to purchase other banks within the state.|$|E

500|$|The {{horse had}} {{nationwide}} appeal, but California Chrome's core fan base was {{centered in the}} Central Valley of California; the Sacramento television market ranked sixth in the nation for television viewership on Preakness day, and third in the nation on Belmont day. Prior to the Belmont, singer–songwriter team Templeton Thompson and Sam Gay wrote and recorded a song titled [...] "Bring it on Home, Chrome" [...] and a rap video featuring an <b>elementary</b> <b>school</b> <b>children</b> was released on YouTube. Even after his Belmont loss, Harris Farms fielded many calls daily from fans wanting to visit the horse while he had a break from racing in June and July 2014. In contrast to his admirers, California Chrome's image was somewhat diminished by the criticism that followed Coburn's post-Belmont comments. [...] Additional negative press occurred when Martin turned down an offer to bring California Chrome to parade in the paddock at Del Mar {{on the day of}} the Pacific Classic. [...] NPR's Frank Deford had little patience with the horse's story exemplifying the American dream; DeFord felt that the horse's victories would have little impact on the popularity of horse racing, which he viewed as [...] "a sport that is struggling against time and culture" [...] due to the prevalence of other types of gambling and the reduced impact of horses in the daily lives of most people.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose for}} this study was to {{document}} the creation of effective linkages between the Figsboro <b>Elementary</b> <b>School</b> <b>Child</b> Study Committee and agencies that serve children and families. The study also reflects on the process of action research used by the researcher as a vehicle to create systemic change for the Child Study Committee. Ten members of the Figsboro <b>Elementary</b> <b>School</b> <b>Child</b> Study Committee, in addition to referring teachers, parents, and agency representatives, participated in this qualitative study. The researcher in this study also participated in the roles of the principal and participant observer. Leadership, staff development, group composition, parent involvement, past experiences, and time and schedules emerged as themes that led {{to the conclusion that the}} barriers that were inhibiting the development of linkages also were barriers that prevented the Figsboro <b>Elementary</b> <b>School</b> <b>Child</b> Study Committee from performing as effectively as it should have been. The identification of these themes led to the transformation of an uninformed principal and Child Study Committee to an informed principal and Child Study Committee. Having a knowledge of Child Study Committee purposes and an awareness of the roles that agencies that serve children and families play resulted in a more effective Child Study Committee at Figsboro Elementary. The principal in the building was the ii person whom Committee members, agency representatives, and parents looked to set the tone for systemic change. Action research provided the vehicle for the principal to evaluate a problem and initiate action steps that were constantly evaluated and re-evaluated in order for the Child Study Committee to perform at a maximum capacity. iii DEDICATION This manuscript is dedicated to my dear fri [...] ...|$|R
