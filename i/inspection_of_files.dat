[...] Following the Addis Ababa Agreement (1972), Enoch Mading de Garang, the Regional Minister of Information, Culture, Youth and Sports in Southern Sudan's High Executive Council (HEC) government, began work on an archive of Southern Sudanese political movements. [...] In 1976, Robert Collins traveled with his wife, Janyce, to southern Sudan, after being invited there by E.M. Garang to compile a report on ways to collect and preserve materials related to Southern Sudan's recent history as part of the Southern Sudan Historical Retrieval Project. Collins consulted scholars and officials, visited the proposed sites for the University of Juba and parliament buildings in Juba, and made an <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>files</b> in Juba, Yei, Maridi, Rumbek, Gogrial, Aweil, Tonj, Yirol, Wau, and Malakal. [...] Robert and Janyce were forced to remain several weeks in Malakal by an outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the Nzara cotton factory, which spread to other parts of southern Sudan. [...] Upon his return to Juba, Collins recommended that E.M. Garang expand the archives to include Southern Sudan's administrative records.|$|E

40|$|File carving is {{the process}} <b>of</b> {{recovering}} <b>files</b> from an investigative target, potentially without knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>file</b> system structures. The process is based on information about the format <b>of</b> the <b>file</b> types <b>of</b> interest, {{as well as on}} assumptions about how files are typically laid out on block devices.

In {{order to identify}} origins and causes of observed tailbacks, historic event log data of loads passing certain waypoints has to be inspected. This paper introduces an approach to automatically carry out transient tailback recognition and cause identification. The approach is based on analysis of holding times and capacities of transport segments. As a result, complete lists of tailbacks and affected segments are provided. Each tailback consists of a reconstructed queue of loads waiting for preceding loads. For each tailback an initial cause event is determined. Additionally, identified tailbacks can be ranked by length or by impact on the transport delays. The developed demonstrator frees the user from time consuming visual <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> log <b>files</b> by providing clearly represented complete tailback information instead. ...|$|R

40|$|There are {{two main}} drivers for network payload inspection: {{malicious}} data, attacks, virus detection in Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) and content detection in Data Leakage Prevention System (DLPS) or Copyright Infringement Detection System (CIDS). Network attacks are {{getting more and more}} prevalent. Traditional network firewalls can only check the packet header, but fail to detect attacks hidden in the packet payload. Therefore, the NIDS with Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) function has been developed and widely deployed. By checking each byte of a packet against the pattern set, which is called pattern matching, NIDS is able to detect the attack codes hidden in the payload. The pattern set is usually organized as a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). The processing time of DFA is proportional to the length of the input string, but the memory cost of a DFA is quite large. Meanwhile, the link bandwidth and the traffic of the Internet are rapidly increasing, the size of the attack signature database is also growing larger and larger due to the diversification of the attacks. Consequently, there is a strong demand for high performance and low storage cost NIDS. Traditional softwarebased and hardware-based pattern matching algorithms are have difficulty satisfying the processing speed requirement, thus high performance network payload inspection methods are needed to enable deep packet inspection at line rate. In this thesis, Stride Finite Automata (StriFA), a novel finite automata family to accelerate both string matching and regular expression matching, is presented. Compared with the conventional finite automata, which scan the entire traffic stream to locate malicious information, the StriFA only needs to scan samples of the traffic stream to find the suspicious information, thus increasing the matching speed and reducing memory requirements. Technologies such as instant messaging software (Skype, MSN) or BitTorrent file sharing methods, allow convenient sharing of information between managers, employees, customers, and partners. This, however, leads to two kinds of major security risks when exchanging data between different people: firstly, leakage of sensitive data from a company and, secondly, distribution of copyright infringing products in Peer to Peer (P 2 P) networks. Traditional DFA-based DPI solutions cannot be used for <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>file</b> distribution in P 2 P networks due to the potential out-of-order manner of the data delivery. To address this problem, a hybrid finite automaton called Skip-Stride-Neighbor Finite Automaton (S 2 NFA) is proposed to solve this problem. It combines benefits of the following three structures: 1) Skip-FA, which is used to solve the out-of-order data scanning problem; 2) Stride-DFA, which is introduced to reduce the memory usage of Skip-FA; 3) Neighbor-DFA which is based on the characteristics of Stride-DFA to get a low false positive rate at the additional cost of a small increase in memory consumption...|$|R
50|$|If {{a binary}} file is opened {{in a text}} editor, each group of eight bits will {{typically}} be translated as a single character, and the user will see a (probably unintelligible) display of textual characters. If the file is opened in some other application, that application will have its own use for each byte: maybe the application will treat each byte as a number and output a stream of numbers between 0 and 255—or maybe interpret the numbers in the bytes as colors and display the corresponding picture. Other type of viewers (called 'word extractors') simply replace the unprintable characters with spaces revealing only the human-readable text. This type of view is useful for quick <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> a binary <b>file</b> {{in order to find}} passwords in games, find hidden text in non-text files and recover corrupted documents. It can even be used to inspect suspicious files (software) for unwanted effects. For example, the user would see any URL/email to which the suspected software may attempt to connect in order to upload unapproved data (to steal). If the file is itself treated as an executable and run, then the operating system will attempt to interpret the file as a series of instructions in its machine language.|$|R

There are several commercially available botulinum toxin type A products used in aesthetic clinical practice. The aim of this retrospective analysis was to compare the clinical efficacy of the most commonly used botulinum toxin type A preparations in daily practice. Methods: Physicians from 21 centers in Germany completed questionnaires based on an <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> subject <b>files</b> for subjects 18 years of age or over who had received at least two, but not more than three, consecutive treatments with incobotulinumtoxinA, onabotulinumtoxinA, or abobotulinumtoxinA within a 12 -month period in the previous 2 years. Data on subject and physician satisfaction, treatment intervals, dosages, and safety were collected from 1256 subjects. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between incobotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA with respect to physician and subject satisfaction, dosages, and adverse effects experienced. Both botulinum toxin type A preparations were well tolerated and effective in the treatment of upper facial lines. Due to low treatment numbers, abobotulinumtoxinA {{was not included in the}} statistical analysis.
