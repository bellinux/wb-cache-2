40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} securitization, negotiability and profitability aspects of three types of muèOErabah instruments; namely, asset-enfaced muèOErabah instruments, currency-enfaced muèOErabah instruments representing monetary contributions and currency-enfaced muèOErabah instruments representing real assets. This paper begins with a distinction between ribOE (usury) and profit and concludes that an <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> currencyenfaced muèOErabah <b>instruments</b> in varying amounts entails ribOE while an <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> asset-enfaced muèOErabah <b>instruments</b> will generate legitimate profits. The current practice is to issue currency-enfaced muèOErabah instruments but treat them as asset-enfaced muèOErabah instruments.

The poem tells the tale of two herdsmen, Damoetas and Daphnis, gathering their herds {{in the same spot}} where Daphnis engages Damoetas in a singing competition. Daphnis addresses the state of the relationship between Polyphemus and Galatea, whereby she both flirts with and teases him. However, Daphnis warns Polyphemus of the consequences of actively wooing her. Following Daphnis’ song, Damoetas answers by assuming the role of Polyphemus and singing of his actions, which are meant to make her desire him more.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of lunar bases {{will not end}} the need for remote sensing of the lunar surface by orbiting platforms. Human and robotic surface exploration will necessarily be limited to some proximate distance from the support base. Near real-time, high-resolution, global characterization of the lunar surface by orbiting sensing systems {{will continue to be}} essential {{to the understanding of the}} Moon's geophysical structure and the location of exploitable minerals and deposits of raw materials. The Lunar Orbital Prospector (LOP) is an orbiting sensing platform capable of supporting a variety of modular sensing packages. Serviced by a lunar-based shuttle, the LOP will permit the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> packages to meet evolving mission needs. The ability to recover, modify, and rotate sensing packages allows their reuse in varying combinations. Combining this flexibility with robust orbit modification capabilities and near real-time telemetry links provides considerable system responsiveness. Maintenance and modification of the LOP orbit are accomplished through use of an onboard propulsion system that burns lunar-supplied oxygen and aluminum. The relatively low performance of such a system is more than compensated for by the elimination of the need for Earth-supplied propellants. The LOP concept envisions a continuous expansion of capability through the incorporation <b>of</b> new <b>instrument</b> technologies and the addition of platforms...|$|R
50|$|However, such unilateral, {{constitutive}} recognition was {{not accepted}} by Brazilians, who demanded a declarative {{recognition of the}} independence as proclaimed and existing since 1822. The new Brazilian Government therefore made the establishment of peaceful relations and diplomatic ties with Portugal conditional on the signature of a bilateral treaty between the two Nations. Portugal eventually agreed, and a treaty to that effect was signed with British mediation. The treaty between the Empire of Brazil and the Kingdom of Portugal on the recognition of Brazilian independence, signed in Rio de Janeiro on August 29, 1825, finally entered into force on November 15, 1825, upon the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> the <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> ratification in Lisbon.|$|R

Panama would grant the United States rights to operate, maintain, and manage the canal through a new United States government agency, the Panama Canal Commission. The commission would be supervised by a board of five members from the United States and four from Panama; the ratio was fixed {{for the duration of the}} treaty. The commission would have a United States administrator and Panamanian deputy administrator until January 1, 1990, when the nationalities of these two positions would be reversed. Panamanian nationals would constitute a growing number of commission employees in preparation for their assumption of full responsibility in 2000. Another binational body, the Panama Canal Consultative Committee, was created to advise the respective governments on policy matters affecting the canal's operation.|$|E

40|$|In {{standard}} laparoscopic procedures, instrument changes {{account for}} {{a significant amount of}} time; they interrupt the surgeon's concentration and involve a reorientation <b>of</b> the new <b>instrument</b> at the region of interest. To further improve the patients' and surgeons' situation an automated system for fast <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic <b>instruments</b> is desired. An instrument exchange system (IES) for this purpose has recently been developed at Fraunhofer IPA in Stuttgart, Germany. The basic approach of the IES is to change from the typical rod- or wire based instruments to capsular instruments that are moved and activated by a hydraulic mechanism. Up to five <b>of</b> these <b>instrument</b> capsules can be exchanged and used with this system. A specialty of the shown hydraulic approach is that the fluid can both be used to exchange the capsules as well as to activate the instrument itself. This works as follows. After the exchange sequence the instrument capsule is at its activation position pressed against the mechanical stop. When the hydraulic pressure in the working tube gets further increased a piston inside the capsule is forced to move axially towards the distal end of the tube. This piston movement is transmitted inside the capsule into the closure of surgical graspers or scissors. With using the shown hydraulic system both for activation and <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> capsules the overall system can be kept small and lightweight - the major advantage of the presented approach. In addition to mentioned graspers and scissors other instruments like electrosurgical ones or even capsular endoscopic cameras could be used and automatically exchanged. Based on the concept previously described a first prototype of the IES has been realized, assembled and tested. At current state the system is designed to work in combination with a surgical robot. Additionally first instrument capsules have been designed, built up as a prototype and tested in a test rig. In conclusion an innovative concept for an automatic instrument exchange system (IES) for capsular laparoscopic instruments has been presented. The approach is based one common hydraulic system for both the instrument activation as well as the exchange. With the prototype setups of both, IES and instruments a first proof of concept have been made. Future developments have to focus on rise of the performance as well as miniaturization of the system {{in order to make it}} possible for the surgeon to use it "handheld" without the assistance of a surgical robot...|$|R
