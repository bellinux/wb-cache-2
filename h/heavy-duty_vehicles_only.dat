40|$|<b>Heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{have been}} {{considered}} a large fraction of emissions from on-road vehicles, but have become of greater interest, as the light-duty emissions have been controlled {{to a greater extent}} than <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Because a <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> can produce 10 to 100 times the emissions (of NOx and PM emissions especially) of a light-duty <b>vehicle,</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> activity needs to be better understood and characterized. One of the key uncertainties with the use of MOBILE 6 includes the fraction of <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> on all types of roadways at all times of day. This paper describes the analysis of extensive automatic traffic recorder (ATR) data collected by State Departments of Transportation to investigate overall and temporal (hour of day, day of week, and month of year) patterns of vehicle mix by roadway type. A method is described and used to cross-reference the vehicle types identified by ATR data into MOBILE 6 vehicle types and used to estimate fleet emissions. Comparisons will be provided that show the differences in the spatial and temporal emissions estimates by roadway type compared with estimates using the national average fleet mix...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Vehicle {{platooning}} {{is important}} for <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> manufacturers, due to the reduced aerodynamic drag for the follower vehicles, which gives an overall lower fuel consumption. <b>Heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> drivers are aware this fact and sometimes drive close to other <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles.</b> However, it is not currently well known how many vehicles are actually driving in such spontaneous platoons today. This paper studies the platooning rate of 1, 800 <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> by analyzing sparse vehicle position data from a region in Europe during one day. Map-matching and path-inference algorithms are used to determine which paths the vehicles took. The spontaneous platooning rate {{is found to be}} 1. 2 %, which corresponds to a total fuel saving of 0. 07 % compared to if none of the vehicles were platooning. Furthermore, we introduce several virtual coordination schemes. We show that coordinations can increase the platooning rate and fuel saving with a factor of ten with minor adjustments from the current travel schedule. The platooning rate and fuel savings can be significantly greater if higher flexibility is allowed. I...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{the public health}} and welfare concerns associated with the pollutants impacted by this rulemaking, and the emission reductions {{that are expected to}} occur {{as a result of the}} proposed new standards for <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In addition, the results of our analysis of <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> inventory levels with and without the proposed new standards are presented and discussed for nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and air toxics. A. Health and Welfare Concerns When revising emissions standards for <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles,</b> the Agency considers the effects of air pollutants emitted from <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> on public health and welfare. 1 As discussed in more detail below, the outdoor air quality in many areas of the country is expected to violate federal health-based ambient air quality standards for ground level ozone and particulate matter during the time when this rule would take effect. In addition, some studies have found public health and welfare effects from ozone and fine PM at concentrations that do not constitute a violation of their respective NAAQS.

40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} of both {{industrialization and}} motorization {{of the world}} has led to a sharp rise in the demand for fossil fuels. Concern about the environmental impact caused by burning of these fuels has involved researchers that became engaged in assessing the damages of pollution not only to environment, but also to human health. In this study, carbonyl compounds (CC) were measured in vapor samples from a place impacted by <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> (Bus Station) fuelled with diesel/biodiesel fuel blend (B 5) in Salvador, Brazil. Among them, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and propanone were the most abundant quantified compounds. Concentration levels (ppbV) for major CC detected during the sampling period ranged from 28. 45 to 287. 3 (formaldehyde), 24. 91 to 171. 3 (acetaldehyde) and 5. 835 to 72. 29 (propanone). The obtained data in this site was compared to formaldehyde and acetaldehyde concentrations found in other sites impacted by <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> fuelled with pure diesel and diesel/biodiesel blends. All data were used to make a possible correlation with formaldehyde/acetaldehyde ratio and the relationship with the kind of fuel used by these vehicles. PCA was used to verify possible grouping among 19 sites impacted by <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> and showed two major groups, one characterized by being strongly impacted and the other with a low contribution of <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Thus, the addition of higher concentrations of biodiesel to diesel showed an improvement in the carbonyl concentration profile at places with high circulation of <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles,</b> which had similar profile to those found for sites less impacted by these kind of vehicles...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we review the trends and trajectories of energy use and {{emissions}} in Australia's road transport sector. We find that energy use and emissions in <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> are growing at a greater rate than light-duty <b>vehicles,</b> and that <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> energy consumption will surpass that of light-duty vehicles by 2032. We explore whether popular light-duty alternative energy concepts, such as battery electric technology, are also competitive for <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles.</b> We observe that finding a sustainable energy technology that competes with the high energy density of diesel is a formidable challenge. Alternatives such as natural gas, propane and biofuels have managed to establish a beachhead. However, none have constituted a disruptive threat to diesel oil. The lack of any silver bullet technology indicates that further research into technology options is warranted. Hydrogen fuel cell systems have many characteristics which are attractive for the heavy-duty transport task, including complementarity with electric vehicles and a cross-benefit from developments in batteries and electric drivetrains. We conclude that for Australia, fuel cells may find their niche in the electrification of heavy-duty drivetrains, in markets where zero emissions are desirable, and where range, duty cycle or payload requirements exceed the capabilities of battery [...] <b>only</b> <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R

40|$|A vehicle {{emissions}} inventory is {{an account of}} emissions produced by all vehicles in an area. Many different factors can affect the emissions and the measurement of the emissions {{that are used to}} create an {{emissions inventory}}. These factors for <b>heavy-duty</b> diesel <b>vehicles</b> have been addressed and their relative affect on emissions was evaluated from test data and analytical analyses. These elements can affect the emissions by a factor of 15 depending on testing conditions. One purpose that an emissions database serves is to provide a source for predicting future emissions for a specific vehicle or many vehicles in a general area. Using a database directly for prediction is ideal, but no comprehensive data set currently exists that covers all of the different vehicle and component combinations that exist in current use. Numerical models can be used to take the existing information about vehicle emissions and calculate the emissions that would be produced by all the vehicles in an inventory. The Transportable <b>Heavy-Duty</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Emissions Testing Laboratories at WVU have collected emissions data from <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> for approximately 8 years.
