5|$|A <b>document</b> that {{purports to}} be a subversive <b>document</b> {{is presumed to}} be one until the {{contrary}} has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive <b>document,</b> he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the <b>document</b> and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents {{and the nature of the}} contents of the <b>document,</b> and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the <b>document</b> was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive <b>document</b> to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating the contents of such a <b>document</b> to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that Theophanu kept the <b>document</b> until October 989, when she left for her journey to Italy and Rome, at which time it is {{believed}} she placed it in Gandersheim Abbey to preserve the <b>document.</b> It was discovered and published in 1700 by writer and historian Johann Georg Leuckfeld. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz {{was among the first}} to recognise the historical significance of this <b>document,</b> and reports on it in History of Welf. After the secularisation of Gandersheim Abbey in 1811, the <b>document</b> was transferred to the Göttingen State and University Library. On 4 May 1820, the archives from the abbey were delivered to the treasury of the duchy of Brunswick. In 1835, the <b>document</b> was transferred to the State Archives of Wolfenbüttel, where it remains.|$|E

30|$|The multi-principal {{characteristic}} of the Chinese government present is a ternary differentiated authority. Although local governments face a number of superiors, their priorities are mainly concentrated in three principals: the party committee, government, and functional bureaus. This judgment comes from the author’s close participant observation and governmental <b>documents</b> from all levels in the country. A local government mainly receives three types of documents: party committee and government <b>documents,</b> government <b>documents,</b> and bureau normative <b>documents.</b> For example, the central-level government handles <b>documents</b> of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, State Council <b>documents,</b> and normative <b>documents</b> of ministries and commissions. At the provincial level, there are <b>documents</b> of the provincial party committee and government, provincial government <b>documents,</b> and bureau normative <b>documents.</b> <b>Documents</b> {{of the city and}} county levels are similar. Existing studies have pointed out that government <b>documents</b> largely determine the attention distribution, daily schedules, and priorities of officials (Weber 1946; Lian 2015); to some extent, the three types of <b>documents</b> also represent three different principals.|$|R
5|$|The {{originality}} of this <b>document</b> {{remains a}} matter of debate. Hans K.

Interpreter Walter Deeters says that the separations in the text act as reading aids, showing that the <b>document</b> {{was intended to be}} read. Diplomats Theodor von Sickel and Carlrichard Brühl believe that the <b>document</b> is not the original as it lacks a seal and the lines are unusually shaped.|$|E

5|$|A <b>document</b> {{prepared}} on 17 July 1943 by the 5th Guards Tank Army headquarters summarised {{the combat}} losses incurred by the formation from 12 to 16 July inclusive {{for all of}} its five corps, as well as smaller units directly subordinated to the army headquarters. The <b>document</b> reported the following irrecoverable losses: 222 T-34s, 89 T-70s, 12 Churchills, 8 SU-122s, 3 SU-76s, and 240 support vehicles. The <b>document</b> reported damaged vehicles still under repair as 143 T-34s, 56 T-70s, 7 Churchills, 3 SU-122s, and 3 SU-76s, with no figures for support vehicles. The <b>document</b> reported personnel casualties as 2,940 killed in action, 3,510 wounded in action, and 1,157 missing in action. This totals 334 irrevocable losses in tanks and self-propelled guns, with another 212 tanks and self-propelled guns under repair, and 7,607 casualties. The historian Karl-Heinz Frieser argued that the majority of these losses must have occurred on 12 July.|$|E

40|$|Text {{classification}} (TC) can {{be described}} as the act of assigning text <b>documents</b> to predefined classes or categories. Its necessity comes from the large amount of electronic <b>documents</b> on the web. The classification accuracy is affected by the content of <b>documents</b> and the classification technique being used. Automatic text summarization is based on identifying the set of sentences that are most important for the overall understanding of <b>document(s).</b> The need for text summarization comes from the large amount of electronic <b>documents</b> and the need for saving processing time. In this research, an automatic text summarizer has been used to summarize <b>documents.</b> Two classification methods have been used to classify Arabic <b>documents</b> before and after applying the summarization, then the classification accuracy of classifying the full <b>documents</b> and summarized <b>documents</b> have been compared. Classification accuracy resulted from classifying full <b>documents</b> is close to that resulted from classifying summarized <b>documents.</b> Nevertheless, memory space required and run time for classifying summarized <b>documents</b> are less than the memory and time needed for classifying full <b>documents...</b>|$|R
5|$|A same-document {{reference}} is a URI {{reference to a}} <b>document</b> containing the URI reference itself.
