40|$|The {{application}} of stability checks in simulated offshore wind structures is performed through tools that are {{established in the}} offshore wind industry. In particular, the structure should fulfill certain strength and fatigue criteria among which Fatigue Limit States (FLSs) checks are critical. In terms of the process, <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> {{can be carried out}} in both time (TD) and frequency domain (FD), with the former being more popular in the offshore wind energy sector. Nevertheless, simplified tools in the FD have been suggested, since they yield results {{similar to those of the}} TD analysis. In order to decide upon the choice of tool in performing the FLS estimations, a relative comparison should be implemented. Particularly, <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> in the TD, <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> in the FD and a simplified type of <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> in the FD are examined. These types of <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> are conducted in three respective tools, with the TD type conducted in NREL’s FAST v 8 and both the FD types simulated within MATLAB tools. The tools are judged upon the desirable levels of Modelling & Simulation (M&S) fidelity. A set of criteria are defined for the particular use case, in an attempt to express that fidelity. The criteria’s metrics are additionally provided in the proposed methodology and associated measurements are taken during simulations. Only after conducting further multi-criteria decision analyses (MCDA), the eventual levels of fidelity for the three types of <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> result to a consequent ranking among the tools. Therefore, the measured criteria lead to the quantification of these levels of fidelity for all three tools and the {{application of}} MCDA results to their ranking. The proposed fidelity framework is applied in a case study in order to evaluate the proposed methodology, as well as to select the type of <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> and consequent tool that should be used within an early design stage. The results indicate that the simplified <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> in the FD should be preferred over conventional <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> in both TD & FD. In addition, the criteria included in the fidelity framework seem to provide a multifaceted approach, since none of the tools is favored in all categories. Finally, similarities in results between relevant types of conducted comparisons as well as between different types of MCDA, enhance the consistency of the proposed fidelity methodology and increase its credibility.

This paper gives a brief presentation of a novel tool for probabilistic <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment,</b> LINKpfat, both capable of performing weakest-link fatigue analysis and fatigue-crack growth analysis based on computationally efficient determination of stress-intensity factors by means of weight functions. Both the traditional peak-stress module and the weakest-link module of LINKpfat are applied to the <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> of an offshore riser joint with moderate stress concentrations for three different load cases.

The task of <b>fatigue</b> life <b>assessment</b> was accomplished {{in such a way}} that it was realized as one-step ahead prediction with respect to each stress level-S corresponding to stress ratio values-R.

40|$|A {{probabilistic}} <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> tool, P•FAT, {{directly applicable}} to the results from a standard finite element stress analysis has been developed. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> tool consist of two deterministic <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> methods: • ‘Local stress approach’ – Life prediction based on the equivalence between the most highly stressed point of a component and a standard smooth fatigue specimen under the same stress. • ‘Single defect approach’ – Life prediction based on {{the growth of a}} single ‘worst-case’ crack-like defect at the location of maximum stress. And of two probabilistic <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> methods: • ‘Weakest-link approach’ – Assumes the probability of survival of a component to be the product of the probabilities of survival of the (small) elements into which the component has been divided for the purpose of analysis. The probability of survival of an element {{is a function of the}} stress cycle, fatigue strength and the size of the element. • ‘Random defect approach’ – The model is based on a finite element stress analysis and assumptions on the defect distribution as well as a theory for the growth of short cracks. Each finite element is associated with one ormore defects by ‘drawing’ from a Poisson distribution. The initial posistion of a defect is obtained from a uniform distribtuion while its size is obtained from an extreme value distribution. The defects are considered to be cracklike, and the number of cycles required for each defect to become critical is determined. By carrying out a large number of such simulations, the fatigue life distribution of the component is obtained. This thesis presents the theory behind the above <b>fatigue</b> <b>assessment</b> methods. In addition, asymptotic K and J solutions for a crack emanating from the root of a notch have been presented. Paper IV and VI reprinted with kind permission Elsevier, sciencedirect. co...|$|E
