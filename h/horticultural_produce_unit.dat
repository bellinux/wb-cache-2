40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} describing the airflow through a vented box packed with <b>horticultural</b> <b>produce.</b> The model {{is based on}} the Darcy–Forchheimer–Brinkman theory of flow through confined porous media. Though questions are raised on the applicability of this theory for the description of high airflow in vented boxes, we show that the model can reproduce experimental data on pressure drop over vented boxes quite accurately. Moreover, we confirm the hypothesis of a power law relationship between the pressure drop and the vent hole ratio of the box. Given the good comparison with experimental data, one can conclude that the model describes the airflow inside the box reasonably well, and when coupled to convection–diffusion models describing heat and water vapour transport, {{it can be used to}} improve designs of vented packages of <b>horticultural</b> <b>produce...</b>|$|R

This objective relevant, to hydrocooler where warm produce is cooled directly by spraying it with chilled water, the process is known as hydrocooling.

Data are also presented to show a similar benefit of ethylene control with green beans, as well as another study showing that apples treated with the ethylene action inhibitor 1 -methylcyclopropene could be stored at a higher temperature without loss of quality to the consumer.

50|$|Losses of <b>horticultural</b> <b>produce</b> are a {{major problem}} in the post-harvest chain. They can be caused by a wide variety of factors, ranging from growing {{conditions}} to handling at retail level. Not only are losses clearly a waste of food, but they also represent a similar waste of human effort, farm inputs, livelihoods, investments and scarce resources such as water. Post-harvest losses for <b>horticultural</b> <b>produce</b> are, however, difficult to measure. In some cases everything harvested by a farmer may end up being sold to consumers. In others, losses or waste may be considerable. Occasionally, losses may be 100%, for example when there is a price collapse and it would cost the farmer more to harvest and market the produce than to plough it back into the ground. Use of average loss figures is thus often misleading. There can be losses in quality, as measured both by the price obtained and the nutritional value, as well as in quantity.|$|R

A key reported beneficial effect of NO treatment is to reduce the production of ethylene. Other reported beneficial effects of NO treatment include a reduced rate of respiration and reduced ion leakage resulting from better maintenance of cellular integrity; reduction in oxidative stress through reduced lipid oxidation and enhanced activity of a range of antioxidant enzymes which have been implicated in defence mechanisms; inhibition of polyphenol oxidase activity associated with reduced internal and surface browning; and alleviation of chilling injury potentially through enhancing the natural antioxidant defence systems which could include endogenous NO.

Weekly quantities, average prices and price differences for apples and tomatoes on the Brisbane market show large differences in prices at any particular time, irrespective of supplies and average price. Price data from the Sydney and Melbourne markets for Delicious apples and bananas, respectively are also examined for price level and variation for specific product lines. The attributes of quality in <b>horticultural</b> <b>produce</b> are described and classified as either sensory or objective.

It predicted that quite high ethylene levels could be tolerated without fruit ripening en route. The equation was also applied to a shipment protocol of 19 days for bananas from Central America to southern Europe. It similarly predicted that fruit could be transported without refrigeration although ethylene levels were close to those in ambient air.

40|$|Simple {{technologies}} {{are required for}} reducing the post harvest losses of <b>horticultural</b> <b>produce.</b> Edible films are being studied extensively for application on fresh and cut fruits and vegetables. Tomato, being a very nutritious and important food and a highly perishable climacteric fruit, this study was planned to investigate the application of chitosan films. Chitosan is a biodegradable waste product from sea food and is safe for consumption. With a view to broaden its antimicrobial activity it was combined with lysozyme, a lytic enzyme. Since the edible films are sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity, they were studied under ambient and optimal conditions of storage. This study showed that 1 % chitosan was more suitable for tomatoes for storage at both conditions of ambient and low temperature. Respiration study showed that 1 % chitosan treatments resulted in more favorable levels of CO 2 production and internal O 2. This {{was reflected in the}} quality of tomatoes held under these conditions. Two per cent chitosan films were unsuitable due to their high CO 2 production and low internal O 2 levels.
