Although leadership is a critical component to team success, it is rarely investigated {{in the context of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>teams.</b> This study sought {{to examine the relationship between}} directive leadership behaviors and team performance outcomes. It was hypothesized that directive leadership would be particularly effective for <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>teams.</b> In addition, a contingency model was proposed. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the effectiveness of directive leadership is contingent upon the complexity of the situation and the experience level of the team such that directive leadership is more effective when teams are inexperienced and the situation is complex. Neonatal resuscitation teams served as the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>teams</b> in this study. The proposed relationships were tested using observations from high-fidelity, neonatal resuscitation team training simulations. Hypotheses were not supported. Limitations and suggestions for future research for the development of leadership training curriculum are discussed...|$|R

50|$|On lap 78, Bellof {{was racing}} Jacky Ickx's works Porsche 962C from the La Source hairpin {{on the run}} to Eau Rouge corner.

Entering the left kink of Eau Rouge, Bellof moved {{to the left of}} Ickx in an attempt to set up a pass for the immediate right-hand Raidillon corner up the hill. Bellof's right front came into contact with Ickx's left rear, and both drivers spun into the barriers. Ickx's car hit the wall on the right rear side, while Bellof's car went straight into the barriers, breaking through and hitting a secondary wall. The Brun Porsche caught fire moments after the wreck, while Ickx - able to climb unaided from his car - attempted to help safety workers in extricating Bellof. During the caution period, members of the Brun team also arrived to aid in the rescue. With smoke pouring from the wreckage, the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> struggled for over 10 minutes before extricating him. Bellof was pronounced dead of massive internal injuries after he had reached the track hospital.|$|E

It will transport Italian Navy helicopters, tracked and wheeled Army vehicles, and hospital facilities that offer two operating theaters. A company of Army engineers is included in the contingent, as well as the Cavour crew members and medical staff, and force protection personnel from the Navy, Army and Air Force. Italian Carabinieri military police will also be on board. Italy will also send a further contingent of 200 members of its military Carabinieri police corps to Haiti to help ensure security for the distribution of aid. The Carabinieri would be part of an EU police force to restore order and end looting on the island.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} ability of <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>team</b> {{criteria}} and the National Early Warning Score to discriminate cardiac arrest, unanticipated ICU admission and death within 24 hours of a vital signs measurement, and to quantify the associated workload. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A large U. K. National Health Service District General Hospital. PATIENTS: Adults hospitalized from May 25, 2011, to December 31, 2013. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We applied the National Early Warning Score and 44 sets of <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>team</b> criteria to a database of 2, 245, 778 vital signs sets (103, 998 admissions). The National Early Warning Score's performance was assessed using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve and compared with sensitivity/specificity for different <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>team</b> criteria. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (95 % CI) for the National Early Warning Score for the combined outcome (i. e., death, cardiac arrest, or unanticipated ICU admission) was 0. 88 (0. 88 - 0. 88). A National Early Warning Score value of 7 had sensitivity/specificity values of 44. 5 % and 97. 4 %, respectively. For the 44 sets of <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>team</b> criteria studied, sensitivity ranged from 19. 6 % to 71. 2 % and specificity from 71. 5 % to 98. 5 %. For all outcomes, {{the position of the}} National Early Warning Score receiver-operating characteristic curve was above and to the left of all <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>team</b> criteria points, indicating better discrimination. Similarly, the positions of all <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>team</b> criteria points were above and {{to the left of the}} National Early Warning Score efficiency curve, indicating higher workloads (trigger rates). CONCLUSIONS: When <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>team</b> systems are compared to a National Early Warning Score value of greater than or equal to 7, some <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>team</b> systems have a higher sensitivity than National Early Warning Score values of greater than or equal to 7. However, all of these <b>medical</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>team</b> systems have a lower specificity and would generate greater workloads...|$|R
5000|$|After {{returning}} home to Maryland, Bias retrieved his newly leased sports car and drove {{back to his room}} {{on the campus of the}} University of Maryland. He then dined with some teammates and a member of the football team. He left campus at approximately 2 a.m. on Thursday, June 19 and drove to an off-campus gathering, which he attended briefly before returning to his dorm in Washington Hall sometime between 2:30 and 3 a.m. For the next three to four hours, Bias, longtime friend Brian Tribble and several teammates repeatedly insufflated cocaine in the dormitory suite shared by Bias and his teammates. [...] According to the campus timeline, Bias had a seizure and collapsed some time between 6:25 and 6:32 a.m. while talking with teammate Terry Long. [...] At 6:32 a.m., when the 911 call to Prince George's County emergency services was made by Tribble, Bias was unconscious and not breathing. All attempts by the <b>emergency</b> <b>medical</b> <b>team</b> to restart his heart and breathing were unsuccessful. After additional attempts to revive him at Leland Memorial Hospital in Riverdale, Maryland, Bias was pronounced dead at 8:55 a.m. of a cardiac arrhythmia related to usage of cocaine. It was reported that there were no other drugs or alcohol found in his system after his death.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} the bone injection gun to obtain vascular access in the prehospital setting by an Helicopter-Transported <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Team.</b> METHODS: Prospective descriptive study to assess the frequency and success rate of {{the use of the}} bone injection gun in prehospital care by a Helicopter-Transported <b>Emergency</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Team.</b> RESULTS: In 40 of 780 (5. 1 %) patients, an attempt was made to obtain intraosseous access with the bone injection gun. Intraosseous access was attempted more often in children than in adults (p < 0. 01). The success rate was 71 % (10 out of 14) in children < 16 years and 73 % (19 out of 26) in adults (p = 1. 0). There were no complications to the health care providers involved and no unwanted sequels to the patients involved. CONCLUSIONS: The bone injection gun is an effective and safe device for the resuscitation of patients in a prehospital setting. It seems to be equivalent in success rate as intraosseous needles in children, but it seems to be more successful in adults...|$|E
