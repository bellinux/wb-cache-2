50|$|<b>Indorenate</b> (TR-3369), is a {{tryptamine}} derivative {{which acts}} as an agonist at the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C serotonin receptors. It has anxiolytic, antihypertensive and anorectic effects, predominantly through action at 5-HT1A, but with some contribution from the 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C subtypes, and possibly some other non-serotonergic targets also.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether <b>indorenate,</b> a serotonin-receptor agonist, can exert discriminative control over operant responses, {{to establish the}} temporal course of discriminative control and to compare its stimulus properties to a (5 -HT) IA receptor agonist. [3 H]- 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-N-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT). DESIGN: Prospective animal study. ANIMALS: Ten male Wistar rats. INTERVENTIONS: Rats were trained to press either of 2 levers for sucrose solution according to a fixed ratio schedule, which was gradually increased. Rats were given injections of either <b>indorenate</b> or saline solution during discrimination training. Once they had achieved an 83 % accuracy rate, rats underwent generalization tests after having received a different dose of <b>indorenate,</b> the training dose of <b>indorenate</b> at various intervals before the test, various doses of 8 -OH-DPT, or NAN- 190 administered before <b>indorenate</b> or 8 -OH-DPAT. OUTCOME MEASURES: Distribution of responses between the 2 levers before the first reinforcer of the session, response rate for all the responses in the session, and a discrimination index that expressed the drug-appropriate responses {{as a proportion of}} the total responses. RESULTS: <b>Indorenate</b> administration resulted in discriminative control over operant responses, maintained at fixed ratio 10, at a dose of 10. 0 mg/kg (but not 3. 0 mg/kg). When the interval between the administration of <b>indorenate</b> and the start of the session was varied, the time course of its cue properties followed that of its described effects on 5 -HT turnover. In generalization tests, the discrimination index was a function of the dose of <b>indorenate</b> employed; moreover, administration of 8 -OH-DPAT (from 0. 1 to 1. 0 mg/kg) fully mimicked the stimulus properties of <b>indorenate</b> in a dose-dependent way. The (5 -HT) IA antagonist NAN- 190 prevented the stimulus generalization from <b>indorenate</b> to 8 -OH-DPAT. Also, NAN- 190 antagonized the stimulus control of <b>indorenate</b> when administered 45 minutes before the session, but not when administered 105 minutes before the session (i. e., 15 minutes before the administration of <b>indorenate).</b> CONCLUSION: (5 -HT) IA receptors are of relevance to the stimulus function of <b>indorenate.</b> However, other receptor subtypes may also be involved. Hence, other agonists and specific antagonists should be studied before definite conclusions are drawn...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the inhibition of sympathetically-induced vasopressor responses produced by 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) in pithed rats is mediated by 5 -HT 1 -like receptors. The present study has re-analysed this suggestion with regard to the classification schemes recently proposed by the NC-IUPHAR subcommittee on 5 -HT receptors. Intravenous (i. v.) continuous infusions of 5 -HT and the 5 -HT 1 receptor agonists, 8 -OH-DPAT (5 -HT 1 A), <b>indorenate</b> (5 -HT 1 A), CP 93, 129 (5 -HT 1 B) and sumatriptan (5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D), resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of sympathetically-induced vasopressor responses. The sympatho-inhibitory responses induced by 5 -HT, 8 -OH-DPAT, <b>indorenate,</b> CP 93, 129 or sumatriptan were analysed before and after i. v. treatment with blocking doses of the putative 5 -HT receptor antagonists, WAY 100635 [*](5 -HT 1 A), cyanopindolol (5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B) or GR 127935 (5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D). Thus, after WAY 100635, the responses to 5 -HT and <b>indorenate,</b> but not to 8 -OH-DPAT, CP 93, 129 and sumatriptan, were blocked. After cyanopindolol, the responses to 5 -HT, <b>indorenate</b> and CP 93, 129 were abolished, whilst those to 8 -OH-DPAT and sumatriptan (except at the lowest frequency of stimulation) remained unaltered. In contrast, after GR 127935, the responses to 5 -HT, CP 93, 129 and sumatriptan, but not to 8 -OH-DPAT and <b>indorenate,</b> were abolished. In additional experiments, the inhibition induced by 5 -HT was not modified after 5 -HT 7 receptor blocking doses of mesulergine. The above results suggest that the 5 -HT 1 -like receptors, which inhibit the sympathetic vasopressor outflow in pithed rats, display the pharmacological profile of the 5 -HT 1 A, 5 -HT 1 B and 5 -HT 1 D, but not that of 5 -HT 7, receptors...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the tachycardic response to 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) in the spinal-transected cat is mediated by ‘ 5 -HT 1 -like' receptors since this effect, being mimicked by 5 -carboxamidotryptamine (5 -CT), is not modified by ketanserin or MDL 72222, but it is blocked by methiothepin, methysergide or mesulergine. The present study was set out to reanalyse this suggestion in terms of the IUPHAR 5 -HT receptor classification schemes proposed in 1994 and 1996. Intravenous (i. v.) bolus injections of the tryptamine derivatives, 5 -CT (0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 1, 0. 3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1), 5 -HT (3, 10 and 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) and 5 -methoxytryptamine (3, 10 and 30 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) as well as the atypical antipsychotic drug, clozapine (1000 and 3000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) resulted in dose-dependent increases in heart rate, with a rank order of agonist potency of 5 -CT >> 5 -HT > 5 -methoxytryptamine >> clozapine. The tachycardic effects of 5 -HT and 5 -methoxytryptamine were dose-dependently antagonized by i. v. administration of lisuride (30 and 100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1), ergotamine (100 and 300 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) or mesulergine (100, 300 and 1000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1); the highest doses of these antagonists used also blocked the tachycardic effects of 5 -CT. Clozapine (1000 and 3000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) did not affect the 5 -HT-induced tachycardia, but attenuated, with its highest dose, the responses to 5 -methoxytryptamine and 5 -CT. However, these doses of clozapine as well as the high doses of ergotamine (300 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) and mesulergine (300 and 1000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) also attenuated the tachycardic effects of isoprenaline. In contrast, 5 -HT-, 5 -methoxytryptamine- and 5 -CT-induced tachycardia were not significantly modified after i. v. administration of physiological saline (0. 1 and 0. 3 [*]ml[*]kg− 1), the 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor antagonist, GR 127935 (500 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) or the 5 -HT 3 / 4 receptor antagonist, tropisetron (3000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1). Intravenous injections of the 5 -HT 1 receptor agonists, sumatriptan (30, 100 and 300 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) and <b>indorenate</b> (300 and 1000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) or the 5 -HT 4 receptor (partial) agonist cisapride (300 and 1000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1) were devoid of effects on feline heart rate per se and failed to modify significantly 5 -HT-induced tachycardic responses. Based upon the above rank order of agonist potency, the failure of sumatriptan, <b>indorenate</b> or cisapride to produce cardioacceleration and the blockade by a series of drugs showing high affinity for the cloned 5 -ht 7 receptor, the present results indicate that the 5 -HT receptor mediating tachycardia in the cat is operationally similar to other putative 5 -HT 7 receptors mediating vascular and non-vascular responses (e. g. relaxation of the rabbit femoral vein, canine external carotid and coronary arteries, rat systemic vasculature and guinea-pig ileum). Since these responses represent functional correlates of the 5 -ht 7 gene product, the 5 -HT 7 receptor appellation is reinforced. Therefore, the present experimental model, which is not complicated by the presence of other 5 -HT receptors, can be utilized to characterize and develop new drugs with potential agonist and antagonist properties at functional 5 -HT 7 receptors...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{infusions of}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) inhibit the tachycardiac {{responses}} to preganglionic (C 7 -T 1) sympathetic stimulation in pithed rats pretreated with desipramine. The present study identified the pharmacological profile of this inhibitory action of 5 -HT. The inhibition induced by intravenous (i. v.) continuous infusions of 5 -HT (5. 6 μg kg− 1 min− 1) on sympathetically induced tachycardiac responses remained unaltered after i. v. treatment with saline or the antagonists GR 127935 (5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D), {{the combination of}} WAY 100635 (5 -HT 1 A) plus GR 127935, ritanserin (5 -HT 2), tropisetron (5 -HT 3 / 4), LY 215840 (5 -HT 7) or a cocktail of antagonists/inhibitors consisting of yohimbine (α 2), prazosin (α 1), ritanserin, GR 127935, WAY 100635 and indomethacin (cyclooxygenase), but was abolished by methiothepin (5 -HT 1 / 2 / 6 / 7 and recombinant 5 -ht 5 A/ 5 B). These drugs, used in doses high enough to block their respective receptors/mechanisms, did not modify the sympathetically induced tachycardiac responses per se. I. v. continuous infusions of the agonists 5 -carboxamidotryptamine (5 -CT; 5 -HT 1 / 7 and recombinant 5 -ht 5 A/ 5 B), CP 93, 129 (r 5 -HT 1 B), sumatriptan (5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D), PNU- 142633 (5 -HT 1 D) and ergotamine (5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D and recombinant 5 -ht 5 A/ 5 B) mimicked the above sympatho-inhibition to 5 -HT. In contrast, the agonists <b>indorenate</b> (5 -HT 1 A) and LY 344864 (5 -ht 1 F) were inactive. Interestingly, 5 -CT-induced cardiac sympatho-inhibition was abolished by methiothepin, the cocktail of antagonists/inhibitors, GR 127935 or the combination of SB 224289 (5 -HT 1 B) plus BRL 15572 (5 -HT 1 D), but remained unchanged when SB 224289 or BRL 15572 were given separately. Therefore, 5 -HT-induced cardiac sympatho-inhibition, being unrelated to 5 -HT 2, 5 -HT 3, 5 -HT 4, 5 -ht 6, 5 -HT 7 receptors, α 1 / 2 -adrenoceptor or prostaglandin synthesis, seems to be primarily mediated by (i) 5 -HT 1 (probably 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D) receptors and (ii) a novel mechanism antagonized by methiothepin that, most likely, involves putative 5 -ht 5 A/ 5 B receptors...|$|E
