40|$|A novel {{energy and}} cost {{effective}} transport chain for stranded natural gas utilized for power production with CO 2 capture and storage is developed. It includes an offshore section, a combined gas carrier, and an integrated receiving terminal. In the offshore process, natural gas (NG) is liquefied to LNG by {{liquid carbon dioxide}} (LCO 2) and liquid inert nitrogen (LIN), which are used as cold carriers. The offshore process is self-supported with power, hot and cold utilities and can operate with little rotating equipment and without flammable refrigerants. In the onshore process, the cryogenic exergy in LNG is used to cool and liquefy the cold carriers, which reduces the power requirement to 319 Â kWh/tonne LNG. Pinch and exergy analyses are used to determine thermodynamically optimized offshore and onshore processes with exergy efficiencies of 87 % and 71 %, respectively. There are very low emissions from the processes. The estimated specific costs for the offshore and onshore process are 8. 0 and 14. 6 <b>EUR</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> LNG, respectively, excluding energy costs. With an electricity price of 100 EUR per MWh, the specific cost {{of energy in the}} onshore process is 31. 9 <b>EUR</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> LNG.

40|$|High costs often {{prevent the}} market {{diffusion}} of novel and efficient energy technologies. Monitoring cost and price decline for these technologies is thus important {{in order to}} establish effective energy policy. Here, we present experience curves and cost-benefit analyses for condensing gas boilers produced and sold in the Netherlands between 1981 and 2006. For the most dominant boiler type on the Dutch market, i. e., condensing gas combi boilers, we identify learning rates of 14 ± 1 % for the average price and 16 ± 8 % for the additional price relative to non-condensing devices. Economies of scale, competitive sourcing of boiler components, and improvements in boiler assembly are among the main drivers behind the observed price decline. The net present value of condensing gas combi boilers shows an overall increasing trend. Purchasing in 2006 a gas boiler of this type instead of a non-condensing device generates a net present value of 970 EUR (Euro) and realizes CO 2 (carbon dioxide) emission savings at negative costs of − 120 <b>EUR</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> CO 2. We attribute two-thirds of the improvements in the cost-benefit performance of condensing gas combi boilers to technological learning and one-third to a combination of external effects and governmental policies...|$|E

On the market, the CentraI American supply deficit resulted in a fall in consumption of between 6 and 12 % in the main import zones.

40|$|German {{companies}} {{participating in}} the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) analyse the consequences of climate policy on their competitiveness {{in a variety of}} ways. When asked whether global climate policy - e. g. decisions adopted at UN climate negotiations - negatively impacted on their competitiveness, 39 per cent of the respondents gave a positive response. 53 per cent of companies expect European climate protection rules, such as the EU ETS, to {{have a negative impact on}} competitiveness. Climate policy at the national level, the turnaround in German Energy Policy (the so-called energy transition), for example, is perceived as being potentially damaging by 59 per cent of companies. This is one of the findings of the KfW/ZEW CO 2 Barometer 2015, an annual survey conducted by KfW bank in cooperation with the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW), since 2009. The survey analyses the impact of the EU ETS on the companies regulated. The variation in the ways in which companies estimate the impact of climate policy on their competitiveness, is particularly pronounced amongst companies which are in international competition. Only around 15 per cent of the firms regulated by EU ETS, however, assume that the impending 2015 UN climate negotiations held in Paris this December, will lead to a binding international agreement. In view of the continuous fall in the price of carbon allowances, the EU has adopted a market stability reserve (MSR) in order to reduce the surplus of carbon credits (estimated at over 2 billion). In the course of this initiative, in the second half of 2014 and in the first half of 2015, the price of carbon allowances slightly increased. The price recorded in August 2015 was approximately <b>EUR</b> 8 <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> of CO 2 - the highest price recorded since November 2012. In view of this trend, German-based companies involved in this survey have, in comparison with last year 2 ̆ 019 s survey, adjusted their short, middle, and long-term price expectations upwards. The inflation-adjusted price is accordingly expected to stand at <b>EUR</b> 7. 82 <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> of CO 2 in December 2015. It is estimated, that the price will increase to EUR 15. 92 by 2020, and reach EUR 25. 45 by 2030. As price expectations remain below <b>EUR</b> 30 <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> of CO 2, the surveyed companies still consider it unlikely that any real incentives to sustainably cut emissions will be created. In 2014, a majority of 76 per cent of companies, invested in the reduction of carbon emissions or shifted to green production processes. As previous studies have shown, however, only ten per cent of the responding companies actually had the objective of cutting carbon emissions. Process optimisation and investments in energy efficiency were the main motivations for any climate commitments made. The KfW/ZEW CO 2 Barometer is a joint project between KfW bank and ZEW. Since 2009, the project has served to analyse the impact of the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on companies in Germany. Around 800 companies are invited to participate in the annual survey. On average, 140 companies each year provide information about their current situation and future strategies...|$|R
