40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a knitting technique for making innovative curved three-dimensional (3 D) spacer fabrics {{by the computer}} <b>flat-knitting</b> <b>machine.</b> During manufacturing, a number of reinforcement yarns made of aramid fibres are inserted into 3 D spacer fabrics along the weft direction to enhance the fabric tensile properties. Curved, flat-knitted 3 D spacer fabrics with different angles (in the warp direction) were also developed. Tensile tests were {{carried out in the}} weft and warp directions for the two spacer fabrics (with and without reinforcement yarns), and their stressâ€“strain curves were compared. The results showed that the reinforcement yarns can reduce the fabric deformation and improve tensile stress and dimensional stability of 3 D spacer fabrics. This research can help the further study of 3 D spacer fabric when applied to composites...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} using weft-knitting technology to fabricate negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) knitted fabrics, which exhibit the unusual property of becoming wider when stretched. Based on a geometrical analysis of a three-dimensional NPR structure constructed with parallelogram planes of the same shape and size, {{a new kind of}} NPR weft-knitted fabric was firstly designed and fabricated on a computerized <b>flat-knitting</b> <b>machine.</b> Then the NPR values of these fabrics were evaluated and compared with those from the theoretical calculations. The results show that all knitted fabrics have the NPR effect, which decreases with increased strain in the course direction. This variation trend is consistent with the theoretical prediction. The results also show that the main structure parameter affecting the NPR effect of a fabric is the opening angle at its initial state. Fabric with a smaller opening angle will have higher NPR values. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating NPR-knitted fabrics by using weft-knitting technology if a suitable structure and parameters are selected.

40|$|Earlier {{studies on}} the {{dimensional}} behaviour and properties of plain knitted wool fabrics were only confined to a narrow range of yarn counts and machine gauges leading to sectional and conflicting experimental results. In this project, plain knitted wool fabrics produced by common-gauge hand <b>flat-knitting</b> <b>machines</b> were investigated for dimensional properties in terms of appropriate yarn linear densities, twist factors and tightness factors. The knitted fabrics were then allowed to undergo the simulated industrial relaxation. The data obtained after statistical analysis revealed the significance {{as well as the}} correlation of loop length, yarn count, tightness factor, machine gauge and twist factor that would affect the linear and area dimensions of the resultant fabrics.

40|$|Early {{studies on}} the {{saturated}} felting value of the untreated plain knitted wool fabrics were only confined to a narrow range of yarn linear densities and machine gauges without any generalised conclusion. In this project, the plain knitted wool fabrics produced on commongauge <b>flat-knitting</b> <b>machines</b> were investigated {{in terms of a}} wide range of yarn linear densities, loop lengths, tightness factors, yarn twists and fibre diameters. The knitted fabrics were taken to undergo the IWS 6 x 5 A washing in order to obtain the saturated felting shrinkage. The data obtained after statistical analyses revealed that the saturated felting value of the untreated plain knitted wool fabrics depended upon loop length and tightness factor while the yarn linear density, fibre diameter and yarn twist had no significant effect on the saturated felting value. Further regression analysis also entailed the development of a mathematical model for predicting the saturated felting value of the untreated plain knitted wool fabrics.
