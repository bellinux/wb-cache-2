5|$|Hurricane Katia was {{a classic}} Cape Verde {{hurricane}} that had substantial impact across Europe as a post-tropical cyclone. The eleventh named storm, second hurricane, and second major hurricane of the active 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Katia originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave over the eastern Atlantic on August29. It intensified into a tropical storm the following day and further developed into a hurricane by September1, although unfavorable atmospheric conditions hindered strengthening thereafter. As the storm began to recurve over the western Atlantic, a more hospitable regime allowed Katia to become a major hurricane by September5 and peak as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 140mph (220km/h) that afternoon. <b>Internal</b> <b>core</b> processes, increased wind shear, an impinging cold front, and increasingly cool ocean temperatures all prompted the cyclone to weaken almost immediately after peak, and Katia ultimately transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September10.|$|E

5000|$|Aside {{from the}} method of {{coupling}} energy into the mercury vapor, these lamps {{are very similar to}} conventional fluorescent lamps. Mercury vapor in the discharge vessel is electrically excited to produce short-wave ultraviolet light, which then excites internal phosphors to produce visible light. While still relatively unknown to the public, these lamps have been available since 1990. Unlike an incandescent lamp or conventional fluorescent lamps, there is no electrical connection going inside the glass bulb; the energy is transferred through the glass envelope solely by electromagnetic induction.There are two main types of magnetic induction lamps: external core lamps and <b>internal</b> <b>core</b> lamps. The first commercially available and still widely used form of induction lamp is the <b>internal</b> <b>core</b> type. The external core type, which was commercialized later, has a wider range of applications and is available in round, rectangular and [...] "olive" [...] shaped form factors.|$|E

40|$|As {{semiconductor}} technologies {{continues to}} scale, {{more and more}} cores are being integrated on the same multicore chip. This increase in complexity poses the challenge of efficient data transfer between these cores. Several on-chip network architectures are proposed to improve the design flexibility and communication efficiency of such multicore chips. However, in a larger system consisting of several multicore chips across a board or in a System-in-Package (SiP), the performance {{is limited by the}} communication among and within these chips. Such systems, most commonly found within computing modules in typical data center nodes or server racks, are in dire need of an efficient interconnection architecture. Conventional interchip communication using wireline links involve routing the data from the <b>internal</b> <b>cores</b> to the peripheral I/O ports, travelling over the interchip channels to the destination chip, and finally getting routed from the I/O to the <b>internal</b> <b>cores</b> there. This multihop communication increases latency and energy consumption while decreasing data bandwidth in a multichip system. Furthermore, the intrachip and interchip communication architectures are separately designed to maximize design flexibility. Jointly designing them could, however, improve the communication efficiency significantly and yield better solutions. Previous attempts at this include an all-photonic approach that provides a unified inter/intra-chip optical network, based on recent progress in nano-photonic technologies. Works on wireless inter-chip interconnects successfully yielded better results than their wired counterparts, but their scopes were limited to establishing a single wireless connection between two chips rather than a communication architecture for a system as a whole. In this thesis, the design of a seamless hybrid wired and wireless interconnection network for multichip systems in a package is proposed. The design utilizes on-chip wireless transceivers with dimensions spanning up to tens of centimeters. It manages to seamlessly bind both intrachip and interchip communication architectures and enables direct chip-to-chip communication between the <b>internal</b> <b>cores.</b> It is shown through cycle accurate simulations that the proposed design increases the bandwidth and reduces the energy consumption when compared to the state-of-the-art wireline I/O based multichip communications...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{three-phase}} five legged wound transformer core constructed of two high permeability Si-Fe wound cores and two conventional Si-Fe wound cores. The two large <b>internal</b> wound <b>cores</b> are manufactured of high permeability, grain-oriented electrical steel. The two small outer wound cores are manufactured of conventional, grain-oriented electrical steel. The specific arrangement {{is based on}} experimental evidence concerning the peak flux density non-uniformity of the typical three-phase five legged wound transformer core, constructed of the high magnetization grain-oriented steel. Since the peak flux density of the two outer cores {{is lower than the}} two <b>internal</b> <b>cores,</b> low cost, low permeability, conventional grain-oriented electrical steel can be used for the outer cores. Losses, excitation currents, flux waveforms, and their harmonics contents are presented in this paper.

50|$|The type {{species for}} Cyanomyovirus {{of the family}} Myoviridae is Cyanophage AS-1, which was {{isolated}} from a waste stabilization pond, and {{was also the first}} genus recognized.

Cyanophages generally have isometric hexagonal heads with diameters ranging from 55 to 90 nm. There is large morphological variation in this group, which suggests that they infect a variety of host species.

Unique functions that came from historical accumulation decide <b>internal</b> <b>cores</b> of functions and are irreplaceable. Shared functions that are the same as other spheres' functions can be received in the short term to contribute to potential collaborations, but they are not unique. For example, the university functional sphere has teaching, research, and social service functions as its unique functions; at the same time, it has ‘shared functions’ such as technology transfer, policymaking consulting, and spin-off startups. The motivation for the actors to commit to innovation does not only lie in the functional complementarities (shared functions) but also in the unique functions of each sphere.
