2500|$|Additional anthropometric {{measurements}} may {{be relevant}} to designing a chair. [...] Hip breadth is used for chair width and armrest width. [...] <b>Elbow</b> <b>rest</b> height is {{used to determine the}} height of the armrests. [...] The buttock-knee length is used to determine [...] "leg room" [...] between rows of chairs. [...] "Seat pitch" [...] is the distance between rows of [...] seats. In some airplanes and stadiums the leg room (the seat pitch less the thickness of the seat at thigh level) is so small that it is sometimes insufficient for the average person.|$|E
50|$|While tapping is most {{commonly}} observed on electric guitar, it may apply {{to almost any}} string instrument, and several instruments have been created specifically to utilise the method. The Bunker Touch-Guitar (developed by Dave Bunker in 1958) is designed for the technique, but with an <b>elbow</b> <b>rest</b> to hold the right arm in the conventional guitar position. The Chapman Stick (developed in the early 1970s by Emmett Chapman) is an instrument designed primarily for tapping, {{and is based on}} the Free Hands two-handed tapping method invented by Chapman in 1969 where each hand approaches the fretboard with the fingers aligned parallel to the frets. The Hamatar, Mobius Megatar, Box Guitar, and Solene instruments were designed for the same method. The NS/Stick and Warr Guitar are also built for tapping, though not exclusively. The harpejji is a tapping instrument which is played on a stand, like a keyboard, with fingers typically parallel to the strings rather than perpendicular. All of these instruments use string tensions less than a standard guitar, and low action to increase the strings' sensitivity to lighter tapping.|$|E

40|$|Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a {{disorder}} of articular cartilage and subchondral bone. In the elbow, an OCD is localized most commonly at the humeral capitellum. Teenagers engaged in sports that involve repetitive {{stress on the}} elbow are at risk. A high index of suspicion is warranted to prevent delay in the diagnosis. Plain radiographs may disclose the lesion but computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are more accurate in the detection of OCD. To determine the best treatment option {{it is important to}} differentiate between stable and unstable OCD lesions. Stable lesions can be initially treated nonoperatively with <b>elbow</b> <b>rest</b> or activity modification and physical therapy. Unstable lesions and stable lesions not responding to conservative therapy require a surgical approach. Arthroscopic debridement and microfracturing has become the standard initial procedure for treatment of capitellar OCD. Numerous other surgical options have been reported, including internal fixation of large fragments and osteochondral autograft transfer. The aim {{of this article is to}} provide a current concepts review of the etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of elbow OC...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and aims}}   {{the main part}} of students' time is spent at school. Recent studies have  released that lack of match between students' {{anthropometry}} size and dimensions of existing  furniture is a risk factor in creating discomfort and muscle- skeletal disorders (such as backache and neck pain), reducing concentration, increasing fatigue, restless and eyestrain in youths and students.   Methods   In this study 982 students, 493 male (50. 2 %) and 489 female (49. 8 %) ranging 7 - 12 years old, were selected. In addition to age, sex, weight and height, six dimensions of anthropometric measures including: shoulder height, <b>elbow</b> <b>rest</b> height, knee height, popliteal height, buttock-popliteal length and hip breadth by anthropometry, caliper and adjustable seat height, goniometry, tape and scale, were taken into account.   Results   This study explains that there is {{a significant difference between the}} minimum and  maximum acceptable and available dimensions of furniture (p< 0. 001). The Height of desk in old  design is higher than acceptable height for many students (in the order of size in 100, 95. 4, and 74. 3 percent). The seat depth in this design is shorter for the majority of students (in the order of size in 92. 1, 92 and 97. 9 percent of studied students).   Conclusion   In designing suitable furniture for students, considering available anthropometry differences in age and sex is essential. ...|$|E
40|$|Selected anthropometric {{measures}} {{of two hundred}} primary school pupils in Ibadan North Local Government Area of Oyo State were used to design classroom desks and tables. The relevant anthropometric measures were popliteal height, buttock-popliteal length, <b>elbow</b> <b>rest</b> height, hip breadth, shoulder height and elbow-hand grip. The pupils with age range from 5 to 14 years (mean = 9. 8 years, SD = 2. 9 years) were grouped into three age groups of 5 - 8 years, 9 - 12 years and 13 - 14 years. From the data obtained; 5 th, 10 th, 50 th, 75 th, 90 th and 95 th percentiles were computed. In addition, 2 -Tail Paired samples T-Test was conducted for the measurements of {{the male and female}} pupils for the three- age groups at 0. 05 level of significance. Based on the anthropometric data obtained, this paper proposes furniture design dimensions for seat height (32. 0 cm, 37. 3 cm and 40. 3 cm for 5 - 8 years, 9 to 12 years and 13 - 14 years respectively). It proposes seat depth (33. 0 cm, 38. 0 cm and 41. 0 cm for 5 - 8 years, 9 to 12 years and 13 - 14 years respectively) and seat width (30. 0 cm, 31. 0 cm and 31. 0 cm for 5 - 8 years, 9 to 12 years and 13 - 14 years respectively). Moreover, it proposes backrest height (upper) (39. 0 cm, 43. 0 cm and 44. 0 cm for 5 - 8 years, 9 to 12 years and 13 - 14 years respectively) and arm rest (12. 0 cm, 13. 0 cm and 15. 0 cm for 5 - 8 years, 9 to 12 years and 13 - 14 years respectively). It also proposes desk height (42. 0 cm, 49. 0 cm and 53. 3 cm for 5 - 8 years, 9 to 12 years and 13 - 14 years respectively...|$|E
