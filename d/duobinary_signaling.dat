40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an improved bit-edge equalization (BEE) method for mitigating intersymbol interference (ISI) in high-speed backplane applications. Using a least-mean-square (LMS) adaptive algorithm as a receiver (RX) error convergence engine, the proposed BEE method {{is based on}} equalizing only the edges of data bits with an adjustment of LMS error derivation points, which in turn changes the error information and affects filter coefficients for pulse amplitude modulation. As a result, the received channel far-end 3 -level bit-edge eye diagrams can be optimized. This proposed BEE method employs a conventional symbol-spaced FIR (SSF) filter as transmitter (TX) pre-emphasis for bit-edge equalization. With TX data pre-coding, the received channel far-end 3 -level signal to 2 -level binary decoding only depends on the current received bit. No error propagation occurs. In this work, the proposed BEE method is compared with the conventional bit-center equalization (BCE) method and the <b>duobinary</b> <b>signaling</b> method.

The persistent demand for increased data throughput in computer desktops and servers has been driving {{the design and}} development of high-speed I/O links in CMOS technologies. Frequency dependent channel loss and imperfections, such as impedance discontinuities, in I/O transceiver building blocks lead to inter-symbol interference (ISI) which limits the achievable link throughput. Crosstalk noise from neighboring channels results in both timing and amplitude errors with the growing data rate trends in chip-tochip communication. In addition, increasing ISI and crosstalk noise sources complicates the design of critical circuit blocks such as timing recovery. All these factors exacerbate the eye closure at the receiver and adversely affect the performance or bit-error-rate (BER) of the overall link. This thesis extends the design scope of current high-speed I/O systems by applying the joint know-how in advanced digital communication and novel circuit implementations. Several architectures and schemes including equalization, timing recovery and timing generation circuits are proposed which {{address some of the}} limiting factors in today’s chip-to-chip I/O links. First, partial response (PR) equalization is presented analyzed and demonstrated as a successful candidate for steep roll-off channel classes. Based on this technique, a transceiver with PR transmit equalizer and a 1 -tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is proposed which increases the signal to noise (SNR) of the received signal at the receiver decision circuit input. The proposed PR 1. 1. b equalization in this thesis outperforms <b>duobinary</b> <b>signaling</b> by 28 % and 19 % when comparing vertical eye opening and by 10 % and 7 % when comparing horizontal eye opening at 10 Gbps and 15 Gbps respectively. These improvements become significantly higher when the channel is subjected to severe crosstalk noise sources. Additionally this architecture mitigates the circuit design issue related to tight DFE loop timing and convergence. Second, a novel pilot-based clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit is introduced that eliminates the clock recovery performance dependency on channel ISI components. A 5 Gbps CDR prototype was designed and fabricated in a 0. 13 μm CMOS technology which uses simultaneously data and clock transmission over the same channel. The measured recovered clock rms jitter was 1. 6 ps while only a 5 % voltage overhead was imposed onto the transmitter for the pilot signal when subjected to a channel loss of 10 dB. Third, a 5. 6 GHz transmit phase-locked-loop (PLL), prototyped in a 0. 18 μm CMOS technology, is also presented which dynamically corrects the charge-pump (CP) current and reduces the side-band spurs by 22 dB and therefore improves the jitter quality of the PLL generated clock. Finally a unified configurable I/O transceiver solution is introduced that takes advantages of all the architecture schemes and circuits proposed throughout the thesis for future chip-to-chip communication ICs...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 High speed serial links are {{critical}} components {{for addressing the}} growing demand for I/O bandwidth in next-generation computing applications, such as many-core systems, backplane and optical data communications. Due to continued process scaling and circuit innovations, today's CMOS serial link transceivers can achieve tens of Gb/s per pin. However, most of their reported power efficiency improves much slower than the rise of data rate. Therefore, aggregate I/O power is increasing and will exceed the power budget if the trend for more off-chip bandwidth is sustained. In this work, a system level statistical analysis of serial links is first described, and compares the link performance of Non-Return-to-Zero (2 -PAM) with higher-order modulation (<b>duobinary)</b> <b>signaling</b> schemes. This method enables fast and accurate BER distribution simulation of serial link transceivers that include channel and circuit imperfections, such as finite pulse rise/fall time, duty cycle variation, and both receiver and transmitter forwarded-clock jitter. Second, {{in order to address}} link power efficiency, two test chips have been implemented. The first one describes a quad-lane, 6. 4 - 7. 2 Gb/s serial link receiver prototype using a forwarded clock architecture. A novel phase deskew scheme using injection-locked ring oscillators (ILRO) is proposed that achieves greater than one UI of phase shift for multiple clock phases, eliminating phase rotation and interpolation required in conventional architectures. Each receiver, optimized for power efficiency, consists of a low-power linear equalizer, four offset-cancelled quantizers for 1 : 4 demultiplexing, and an injection-locked ring oscillator coupled to a low-voltage swing, global clock distribution. Measurement results show a 6. 4 - 7. 2 Gb/s data rate with BER < 10 ⁻¹² across 14 cm of PCB, and an 8 Gb/s data rate through 4 cm of PCB. Designed in a 1. 2 V, 90 nm CMOS process, the ILRO achieves a wide tuning range from 1. 6 - 2. 6 GHz. The total area of each receiver is 0. 0174 mm², resulting in a measured power efficiency of 0. 6 mW/Gb/s. Improving upon the first test chip, a second test chip for 8 Gb/s forwarded clock serial link receivers exploits a low-power super-harmonic injection-locked ring oscillator for symmetric multi-phase local clock generation and deskewing. Further power reduction is achieved by designing most of the receiver circuits in the near-threshold region (0. 6 V supply), with the exception of only the global clock buffer, test buffers and synthesized digital test circuits at nominal 1 V supply. At the architectural level, a 1 : 10 direct demultiplexing rate is chosen to achieve low supply operation by exploiting high-parallelism. Fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology, two receiver prototypes are integrated in this test chip, one without and the other with front-end boot-strapped S/Hs. Including the amortized power of global clock distribution, the proposed serial link receivers consume 1. 3 mW and 2 mW respectively at 8 Gb/s input data rate, achieving a power efficiency of 0. 163 mW/Gb/s and 0. 25 mW/Gb/s. Measurement results show both receivers achieve BER < 10 ⁻¹² across a 20 -cm FR 4 PCB channel...|$|E
40|$|The {{relentless}} {{growth of}} data traffic and increasing {{digital signal processing}} capabilities of integrated circuits (IC) are demanding ever faster chip-to-chip / chip-to-module serial electrical interconnects. As data rates increase, the signal quality after transmission over printed circuit board (PCB) interconnections is severely impaired. Frequency-dependent loss and crosstalk noise lead to a reduced eye opening, a reduced signal-to-noise ratio and an increased inter-symbol interference (ISI). This, in turn, {{requires the use of}} improved signal processing or PCB materials, in order to overcome the bandwidth (BW) limitations and to improve signal integrity. By applying an optimal combination of equalizer and receiver electronics together with BW-efficient modulation schemes, the transmission rate over serial electrical interconnections can be pushed further. At the start of this research, most industrial backplane connectors, meeting the IEEE and OIF specifications such as manufactured by e. g. FCI or TE connectivity, had operational capabilities of up to 25 Gb/s. This research was mainly performed under the IWT ShortTrack project. The goal of this research was to increase the transmission speed over electrical backplanes up to 100 Gb/s per channel for next-generation telecom systems and data centers. This requirement greatly surpassed the state-ofthe-art reported in previous publications, considering e. g. 25 Gb/s duobinary and 42. 8 Gb/s PAM- 4 transmission over a low-loss Megtron 6 electrical backplane using off-line processing. The successful implementation of the integrated transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) (1), clearly shows the feasibility of single lane interconnections beyond 80 Gb/s and opens the potential of realizing industrial 100 Gb/s links using a recent IC technology process. Besides the advancement of the state-of-the-art in the field of high-speed transceivers and backplane transmission systems, which led to several academic publications, the output of this work also attracts a lot of attention from the industry, showing the potential to commercialize the developed chipset and technologies used in this research for various applications: not only in high-speed electrical transmission links, but also in high-speed opto-electronic communications such as access, active optical cables and optical backplanes. In this dissertation, the background of this research, an overview of this work and the thesis organization are illustrated in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, a system level analysis is presented, showing that the channel losses are limiting the transmission speed over backplanes. In order to enhance the serial data rate over backplanes and to eliminate the signal degradation, several technologies are discussed, such as signal equalization and modulation techniques. First, a prototype backplane channel, from project partner FCI, implemented with improved backplane connectors is characterized. Second, an integrated transversal filter as a feed-forward equalizer (FFE) is selected to perform the signal equalization, based on a comprehensive consideration of the backplane channel performance, equalization capabilities, implementation complexity and overall power consumption. NRZ, duobinary and PAM- 4 are the three most common modulation schemes for ultra-high speed electrical backplane communication. After a system-level simulation and comparison, the duobinary format is selected due to its high BW efficiency and reasonable circuit complexity. Last, different IC technology processes are compared and the ST microelectronics BiCMOS 9 MW process (featuring a fT value of over 200 GHz) is selected, based on a trade-off between speed and chip cost. Meanwhile it also has a benefit for providing an integrated microstrip model, which is utilized for the delay elements of the FFE. Chapter 3 illustrates the chip design of the high-speed backplane TX, consisting of a multiplexer (MUX) and a 5 -tap FFE. The 4 : 1 MUX combines four lower rate streams into a high-speed differential NRZ signal up to 100 Gb/s as the FFE input. The 5 -tap FFE is implemented with a novel topology for improved testability, such that the FFE performance can be individually characterized, in both frequency- and time-domain, which also helps to perform the coefficient optimization of the FFE. Different configurations for the gain cell in the FFE are compared. The gilbert configuration shows most advantages, in both a good high-frequency performance and an easy way to implement positive / negative amplification. The total chip, including the MUX and the FFE, consumes 750 mW from a 2. 5 V supply and occupies an area of 4. 4 mm × 1. 4 mm. In Chapter 4, the TX chip is demonstrated up to 84 Gb/s. First, the FFE performance is characterized in the frequency domain, showing that the FFE is able to work up to 84 Gb/s using duobinary formats. Second, the combination of the MUX and the FFE is tested. The equalized TX outputs are captured after different channels, for both NRZ and <b>duobinary</b> <b>signaling</b> at speeds from 64 Gb/s to 84 Gb/s. Then, by applying the duobinary RX 2, a serial electrical transmission link is demonstrated across a pair of 10 cm coax cables and across a 5 cm FX- 2 differential stripline. The 5 -tap FFE compensates a total loss between the TX and the RX chips of about 13. 5 dB at the Nyquist frequency, while the RX receives the equalized signal and decodes the duobinary signal to 4 quarter rate NRZ streams. This shows a chip-to-chip data link with a bit error rate (BER) lower than 10 − 11. Last, the electrical data transmission between the TX and the RX over two commercial backplanes is demonstrated. An error-free, serial duobinary transmission across a commercial Megtron 6, 11. 5 inch backplane is demonstrated at 48 Gb/s, which indicates that duobinary outperforms NRZ for attaining higher speed or longer reach backplane applications. Later on, using an ExaMAX® backplane demonstrator, duobinary transmission performance is verified and the maximum allowed channel loss at 40 Gb/s transmission is explored. The eye diagram and BER measurements over a backplane channel up to 26. 25 inch are performed. The results show that at 40 Gb/s, a total channel loss up to 37 dB at the Nyquist frequency allows for error-free duobinary transmission, while a total channel loss of 42 dB was overcome with a BER below 10 − 8. An overview of the conclusions is summarized in Chapter 5, along with some suggestions for further research in this field.

Although Non Return to Zero (NRZ) modulation is suitable for long haul systems due to its simplicity, one way of achieving a more efficient use of channel bandwidth is to use duobinary coding.

We also have presented experimental results for FSR optimization of DQPSK de-modulator for ultra-high data-rate systems in the presence of strong optical filtering. Choice of an optimal FSR beyond 1 -bit delay in Mach-Zehnder delay interferometer (MZ-DI) helps relieving some of the degradations due to strong optical filtering.
