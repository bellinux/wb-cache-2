This research used factorial randomized block design (RBD) using two factors. Each factor consists of three levels with three replications. Those factors are: (1) factor I : various planting media (M), including 3 levels, namely : M 1 : soil + compost + hull (1 : 1 : 1), M 2 : soil + compost + coconut peat (1 : 1 : 1), M 3 : soil + compost + bamboo cripples. Factor II: liquid fertilizer concentrations (C) consisting of 3 levels, namely : C 1 : 2 ml per litre water, C 2 : 4 ml per litre water, C 3 : 6 ml per litre water. The observation is conducted when plant age is 1 week after planting (WAP) until 12 weeks after planting. Meanwhile, the observed parameter taken in this research comprise longest leaf length, average leaf length, leaf width, leaf numbers, and sapling numbers. To know effect of treatment application, entire data from the observation results are entered into analysis of variance using test F, accompanied with Duncan test with 5...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARYGunedi Saufa Asri. Effect of Planting Distance and Concentration Organic Liquid Fertilizer Top G 2 Against Plant Growth and Yield Rosella (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) {{under the}} {{guidance}} of Biological Mardhiah as primary mentors and tutors Erida Nurahmi as members. This study aimed to determine the effect of spacing and concentration G 2 TOP liquid organic fertilizer on growth and yield of Roselle, and apparent absence of interaction between the two factors. The research was conducted at the Experimental Station of the Faculty of Agriculture of Banda Aceh, which started from March 2011 to September 2011. Materials and tools used are the seeds rosella sabdariffa varieties, manure, polybag, hoes, rakes, yells, machetes, analytical scales, meter, signage, stationery and writing. This study uses a randomized complete block design (RAK) 3 x 3 factorial with 3 replications. There are two factors studied were spacing consists of 3 levels ie 60 cm x 60 cm, 80 cm x 80 cm, 100 cm x 100 cm and the concentration of liquid organic fertilizer TOP G 2 consisting of 3 levels ie 2 ml / l of water, 4 ml / l of water, and 6 ml / l of water. Variables measured against the roselle plant include plant height (cm), number of branches, number of petals, flower petals and wet weight (g) per plant. Spacing is very significant effect on the number of branches per plant life of 60 days after planting and the heavy wet petals, significantly affect the number of branches per plant life of 45 days after planting and no apparent effect on plant height at 15, 30, 45 and 60 days after planting, the number of branches per plant life 15 and 30 days after planting, and the number of petals per plant ages 65 and 75 days after planting. At the treatment plant spacing, number of branches per plant best in treatment spacing of 60 cm x 60 cm and wet weight per plant rosella flower petals on the best treatment spacing of 80 cm x 80 cm. TOP liquid organic fertilizer G 2 very significant effect on plant height at 30, 45 and 60 days after planting, the number of branches at 15, 45 and 60 days after planting, the number of petals aged 65 and 75 days after planting, and flower petals wet weight per plant. Furthermore no significant effect on plant height age 15 HST and number of branches per plant at 30 days after planting. Concentration of liquid organic fertilizer TOP G 2 gives growth and yield of roselle best in treatment 6 ml / L of water. There is a very real interaction between spacing treatments with liquid organic <b>fertilizer</b> <b>concentration</b> TOP G 2 to the number of branches per plant at the age of 60 HST. Best combination of treatments are on treatment spacing of 100 cm x 100 cm with a liquid organic <b>fertilizer</b> <b>concentration</b> TOP G 2 6 ml / L of water. Banda Ace...|$|E
40|$|Sansiviera is a {{plant that}} hardly needs water, or very little water. This {{occurrence}} is in accordance to its nature as succulent plant capable of preserving water in its leaf tissues. This research aims to know the effect of various farmyard manures and liquid <b>fertilizer</b> <b>concentrations</b> to sansiviera seedling growth. The research was conducted in experimental fields of UMM’s Faculty of Agriculture in Tegalgondo, with altitude of 560 meters from high sea level, starting from April and ended in July 2007. Factorial randomized block design was employed in this research with two factors, each of which consisted of 3 levels, thus delivering 9 combined treatments, added with 1 control treatment with three replications. The observation started within two weeks after planting with interval of 10 days. The following parameter to be observed were the length of longest leaf, length of average leaf, increasing number of width leaf, increasing number of sprouting. The treatment of various farmyard manures and liquid <b>fertilizer</b> <b>concentrations</b> {{to the length of}} longest leaf resulted in significant difference. On 5 th observation, no significant difference occurred due to combined treatments for length of average leaf. The combined treatments resulted in no significant difference for increasing number of width leaf. While the the increasing number of average leaf gave no significant difference with combined treatments. The parameter of leaf increase showed no significant difference. However, on 6 th observation revealed that treatment of chicken farmyard manure + soil + hull with proportion of 1 : 1 : 1 combined with concentration of 9 ml/l water resulted in highest score to variable of increasing number of leaf. Parameter of sprouting number resulted in no significant difference among the combined treatments. The conclusion thus can be drawn that the combined treatments gave no interaction to variables of average leaf length, increasing number of width, and increasing number of sprout. Whereas for variable of the increasing number of longest leaf on 5 th observation resulted in significant difference with goat and chicken farmyard manures, respectively. For leaf increase on 6 th observation the treatments resulted in highest score to variable of increasing number of leaf...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to determine the}} influence of some Azolla liquid <b>fertilizer</b> <b>concentrations</b> and to get the best concentration on the growth of oil palm seeds in main nursery. Research was carried out in land of Plant Laboratory – Agriculture Faculty University of Riau, from February to May 2014. This research arranged experimentaly using Completely Randomized Design (CRD), consist by 5 treatments and each treatment was repeated 4 times then obtained 20 experimental units.

Parameters measured were the increment of seeds height, increment of leaves number, increment of stump diameter, leaf width, root length, root volume, crown root ratio and seeds dry weight. Data were analyzed statistically using ANOVA and further test followed by Duncan 2 ̆ 7 s New Multiple Range Test (DNMRT) at the level of 5...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} static {{experiments to}} assess the effects of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on embryos and larvae of six European amphibians: sharp-ribbed salamander (Pleurodeles waltl), Iberian painted frog (Discoglossus galganoi), western spadefoot toad (Pelobates cultripes), common toad (Bufo bufo), natterjack toad (Bufo calamita), and common tree frog (Hyla arborea). Embryos were exposed to different and environmentally relevant concentrations of ammonium nitrate (0 to 200 mg NO 3 –/L) for 15 days. Hatching {{took place during the}} experiments. H. arborea was extremely sensitive and had high mortality after 8 days of exposure even at the lower fertilizer levels. D. galganoi and B. bufo were also very sensitive and had significant mortality after 15 days of exposure. The rest of the species did not suffer lethal effects but suffered abnormalities or decreased growth at the highest <b>fertilizer</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Chemical <b>fertilizers</b> or manure could have contributed to the observed decrease of B. bufo and D. galganoi in agricultural areas of the Iberian Peninsula during recent years. H. arborea was the most sensitive species studied. The results of our study showed that environmentally relevant levels of ammonium nitrate can induce mortality and might affect population dynamics of this species in agricultural environments.
