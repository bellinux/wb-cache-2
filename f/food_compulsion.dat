40|$|The loss of {{dopamine}} neurons {{observed in}} Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) elicits severe motor control deficits which are {{reduced by the}} use of dopamine agonists. However, recent works have indicated that D 3 -preferential agonists such as pramipexole can induce impulse control disorders such as food craving or compulsive eating. In the present study, we performed an intermittent daily feeding experiment to assess the effect of chronic treatment by pramipexole and VTA bilateral lesion on tolerance for sucrose solution. The impact of such chronic treatment on spontaneous locomotion and spatial memory was also examined. Changes in sucrose tolerance could indicate the potential development of a change in <b>food</b> <b>compulsion</b> or addiction related to the action of pramipexole. Neither the bilateral lesion of the VTA nor chronic treatment with pramipexole altered the spontaneous locomotion or spatial memory in rats. Rats without pramipexole treatment quickly developed a stable intake of sucrose solution in the 12 h access phase. On the contrary, when under daily pramipexole treatment, rats developed a stronger and ongoing escalation of their sucrose solution intakes. In addition, we noted that the change in sucrose consumption was sustained by an increase of the expression of the dopamine 3 receptor in the core and the shell regions of the nucleus accumbens. The present results may suggest that long term stimulation of the dopamine 3 receptor in animals induces a strong increase in sucrose consumption, indicating an effect of this receptor on certain pathological aspects of food eating...|$|E
40|$|Post-weaning mice fed {{exclusively}} milk display low-frequency {{exploratory behavior}} [Ishii, T., Itou, T., and Nishimura, M. (2005) Life Sci. 78, 174 - 179] compared to mice fed a food pellet diet. This low-frequency exploratory behavior switched to high-frequency exploration after a switch from exclusively milk formula {{to a food}} pellet diet. Acquisition of the high-frequency exploratory behavior was irreversible. Recently, we demonstrated that the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (Me 5) {{is involved in the}} control of feeding and exploratory behavior in mice without modulating the emotional state [Ishii, T., Furuoka, H., Itou, T., Kitamura, N., and Nishimura, M. (2005) Brain Res. 1048, 80 - 86]. We therefore investigated whether the Me 5 is involved in acquisition of high-frequency exploratory behavior induced by the switch in diet from an exclusively milk formula to food pellets. Mouse feeding and exploratory behaviors were analyzed using a <b>food</b> search <b>compulsion</b> apparatus, which was designed to distinguish between the two behaviors under standard living conditions. Immunohistochemical analysis of immediate early genes indicated that the Me 5, which receives signals from oral proprioceptors, is transiently activated after the diet change. The change from low-frequency to high-frequency exploratory behavior was prevented in milk-fed mice by bilateral lesion of the Me 5. These results suggest that the Me 5 is activated by signals associated with mastication-induced proprioception and contributes to the acquisition of active exploratory behavior. [URL]...|$|R
