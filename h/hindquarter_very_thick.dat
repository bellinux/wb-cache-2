40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the implications of}} a <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> (scale height 1. 5 - 3. 0 kpc) disk population of MACHOs. Such a population represents a reasonable alternative to standard halo configurations of a lensing population. We find that <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> disk distributions can lower the lens mass estimate derived from the microlensing data toward the LMC, although an average lens mass substantially below 0. 3 is unlikely. Constraints from direct searches for such lenses imply very low luminosity objects: thus thick disks do not solve the microlensing lens problem. We discuss further microlensing consequences of <b>very</b> <b>thick</b> disk populations, including an increased probability for parallax events.

Because of the short, squat body and the way its legs work, these legs often partly conceal the main killing zone. Free shooting carries a high risk of wounding." ...|$|R
