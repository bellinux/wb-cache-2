25|$|In {{the context}} of road cycling, compact {{drivetrain}} typically refers to double cranksets with a smaller (usually 110mm) bolt circle diameter than the standard 130mm or Campagnolo's 135mm. As of 2006, {{all of the major}} component manufacturers such as Shimano and Campagnolo offer compact cranks in their midrange and high-end product lines. The compact crankset provides a compromise between the standard road double crankset (with 39/52 or 39/53 tooth chainrings) and the road triple (with 30/42/52 or 30/39/53 tooth chainrings). The compact crankset has two chainrings and typical ratios are 34/48, 34/50 and 36/50. This provides nearly the same lower gear ratios as a triple but without the need for a third chainring, a triple <b>front</b> <b>derailleur</b> and a long cage rear derailleur. Both Shimano and Campagnolo recommend and sell front derailleurs specifically designed for compact cranksets, claiming better shifting.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of 3 chainrings and an 8-sprocket cogset does {{not result in}} 24 usable gear ratios. Instead it provides 3 overlapping ranges of 7, 8, and 7 gear ratios. The outer ranges only have 7 ratios rather than 8 because the extreme combinations (largest chainring to largest rear sprocket, smallest chainring to smallest rear sprocket) result in a very diagonal chain alignment which is inefficient and causes excessive chain wear. Due to the overlap, there will usually be some duplicates or near-duplicates, so that there might only be 16 or 18 distinct gear ratios. It may not be feasible to use these distinct ratios in strict low-high sequence anyway due to the complicated shifting patterns involved (e.g. simultaneous double or triple shift on the rear derailleur and a single shift on the <b>front</b> <b>derailleur).</b> In the worst case there could be only 10 distinct gear ratios, if the percentage step between chainrings {{is the same as}} the percentage step between sprockets. However, if the most popular ratio is duplicated then it may be feasible to extend the life of the gear set by using different versions of this popular ratio.|$|E
5000|$|... clamp : The vast {{majority}} of <b>front</b> <b>derailleurs</b> are mounted to the frame by a clamp around the frame's seat tube. Derailleurs are available with several different clamp diameters designed to fit different types of frame tubing. Recently, {{there has been a}} trend to make derailleurs with only one diameter clamp, and several sets of shims are included to space the clamp down to the appropriate size.|$|R
5000|$|E-type : This type <b>front</b> <b>derailleurs</b> do not clamp {{around the}} frame's seat tube, but instead are {{attached}} to the frame by a plate mounted under the drive side bottom bracket cup and a screw threaded into a boss on the seat tube. These derailleurs are usually found on mountain bikes with rear suspension components that do not allow space for a normal derailleur's clamp to go around the seat tube.|$|R
25|$|There are two chainrings whose {{relative}} difference (say 10%) {{is about}} half the relative step on the cogset (say 20%). This {{was used in the}} mid-20th century when <b>front</b> <b>derailleurs</b> could only handle a small step between chainrings and when rear cogsets only had a small number of sprockets, e.g. chainrings 44-48 and cogset 14-17-20-24-28. The effect is to provide two interlaced gear ranges without any duplication. However to step sequentially through the gear ratios requires a simultaneous front and rear shift on every other gear change. This style is not available off the shelf.|$|R
2500|$|It takes {{a couple}} of weeks of regular use to become {{accustomed}} to the unusual feel of the Rotor linkage cranksets. [...] After becoming accustomed to it, most riders prefer it. [...] However, there is no difficulty in switching between ordinary cranksets and Rotor linkage cranksets. [...] Once a rider has learned to use Rotor linkage cranksets the adaption when switching back and forth between crankset types only takes a minute or two. [...] Many competitive cyclists, including the Cervélo TestTeam, use Rotor's Q-rings which mimic the fluctuation in gear size without the added weight. However Rotor Q-rings and other non-round rings cannot duplicate the crank arm movements that allow application of power through the dead spots of the pedaling cycle. [...] Non-round rings also increase the difficulty of setting up the <b>front</b> <b>derailleur,</b> while Rotor linkage cranksets present no extra difficulty in that regard.|$|E

25|$|Control cables are routed along mounts {{on the top}} tube, or {{sometimes}} inside the top tube. Most commonly, this includes the cable for the rear brake, but some mountain bikes and hybrid bicycles also route the <b>front</b> and rear <b>derailleur</b> cables along the top tube.|$|R
50|$|A {{wireless}} {{system that}} can be retrofitted onto any bicycle was announced in 2016.

50|$|The rear {{derailleur}} has shift times similar to mechanical systems and a break-away system {{to protect it}} {{in case of a}} crash. The <b>front</b> <b>derailleur,</b> however, switches gears almost 30% faster than Dura-Ace’s mechanical counterpart. On traditional bikes, the <b>front</b> <b>derailleur</b> is problematic because the chain can be under tension and has to make a large vertical jump between chainrings. The electronic system's controlled motion overcomes these problems. The Di2 can also trim the <b>front</b> <b>derailleur</b> to eliminate chain rub and calibrate itself to adjust for wear and tear. Finally, the entire 7970 groupset weighs approximately 113 g less than the 7800 it replaces but 68 g more than the new 7900.|$|E
2500|$|On {{a bicycle}} {{with more than}} one gear change {{mechanism}} (e.g. <b>front</b> and rear <b>derailleur),</b> these three numbers can be quite different, depending on the relative gearing steps of the various mechanisms. [...] The number of gears for such a derailleur equipped bike is often stated simplistically, particularly in advertising, and this may be misleading.|$|R
5000|$|Modern <b>front</b> {{and rear}} <b>derailleurs</b> {{typically}} {{consist of a}} moveable chain-guide that is operated remotely by a Bowden cable attached to a shifter mounted on the down tube, handlebar stem, or handlebar. When a rider operates the lever while pedalling, the change in cable tension moves the chain-guide from side to side, [...] "derailing" [...] the chain onto different sprockets.|$|R
500|$|Klein held {{a patent}} (...) for an {{improved}} {{method of routing}} cables through the frame of a bicycle, that reduced aerodynamic drag and stress on the frame. The <b>front</b> and rear <b>derailleur</b> cables were routed through the down tube, and the rear brake cable through the top tube, although some models changed in 2002 to top tube cable routing for greater harmonisation with Shimano components.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{possibility}} of the chain shifting past the smallest inner chainring, especially when the inner chainring is very small, even on bikes adjusted by professional race mechanics, and the problems such misshifts can cause, a small after-market of add-on products, called chain deflectors, exists to help prevent them from occurring. Some clamp around the seat tube, below the <b>front</b> <b>derailleur,</b> and at least one attaches to the <b>front</b> <b>derailleur</b> mount.|$|E
50|$|On the {{mountain}} bike, {{the aim is}} to propose bicycles that are easy to maintain which is why they will promote the 1x11 gear configuration: It allows for a more simple and durable gearing system (by removing the <b>front</b> <b>derailleur)</b> and allows to avoid the extra gain of weight that a <b>front</b> <b>derailleur</b> would cause. The offset of the gain of weight helps towards reducing the overall weight which has been increased by a steel frame.|$|E

25|$|At {{an extreme}} {{opposite}} {{from a single}} speed bicycle, hub gears can be combined with both <b>front</b> and rear <b>derailleurs,</b> giving a very wide-ranging drivetrain {{at the expense of}} weight and complexity of operation- there are a total of three sets of gears. This approach may be suitable for recumbent trikes, where very low gears can be used without balance issues, and the aerodynamic position allows higher gears than normal.|$|R
50|$|In early March 2006, some pro riders {{were seen}} riding with Shimano {{electronic}} shifting groupsets; further {{testing in the}} pro-ranks continued during the next 2 years. In late 2009, Shimano released their electronically shifted Dura-Ace Di2 groupset, consisting of battery powered, servo actuated <b>front</b> and rear <b>derailleurs</b> controlled by electronic bar-end or brake lever integrated shifting paddles. Other components such as the crankset and brakeset are carryovers from the standard Dura-Ace 7900 group.|$|R
50|$|In 1924, the French bicycle company, Le Cyclo, {{introduced}} a gear-shifting bicycle with a two sprocket freewheel, {{which would allow}} riders to go uphill with more ease. In the late 1920s, Le Cyclo began using both <b>front</b> and rear <b>derailleurs</b> in combination with a double chainring giving the bicycle twice as many gears. In the early 1930s, Le Cyclo invented a four sprocket freewheel and several years later the company combined the four sprocket freewheel with a triple chainring giving the bicycle twelve gears.|$|R
5000|$|Another frame {{surfaced}} {{a couple}} of years ago, and appears to have been built in the mid to late 90s, loosely based on the Colnago Crystal, specifically labeled [...] "Master" [...] on the rear brake hanger. Lugs and seat stays are similar to those on the Crystal, slightly beefier tubing than other road models (32mm OD downtube, 29mm seattube), relaxed wheelbase, top tube routing for rear brake and derailleur, traditional routing for <b>front</b> <b>derailleur</b> but no braze-on for <b>front</b> <b>derailleur.</b> Colnago bottom bracket shell. Straight mtb style threadless fork (no formal crown). No serial number stamped on dropout. Colnago factory contact unable to identify year or provide further information. Photos are available here.|$|E
50|$|The <b>front</b> <b>derailleur</b> {{only has}} to move the chain side to side between the front chainrings, {{but it has to}} do this with the top, taut portion of the chain. It also needs to {{accommodate}} large differences in chainring size: from as many as 53 teeth to as few as 20 teeth.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 2008, the Villager is {{designed}} for urban settings with increased ground clearance, a higher seat of 12.5 in and a 50 degree seat angle. The Villager has 20 in front and rear wheels. The 2008 model was introduced as a nine-speed with no <b>front</b> <b>dérailleur.</b> The 2009 model included the option of a front triple crankset, giving 27 speeds.|$|E
5000|$|Deore XT is a {{mountain}} and touring bike groupset first introduced by Shimano in 1983. It was Shimano's first mountain bike groupset, {{based on their}} existing Deore touring groupset, and it consisted of a triple-chainring crankset, <b>front</b> and rear <b>derailleurs,</b> handlebar-mounted [...] "finger" [...] shifters, cantilever brakes, and large-flange hubs. Since then, it has become their [...] "second-tier" [...] offering, the list of components has expanded to include hydraulic disc brakes, a complete wheelset, a chain, and clipless pedals, and it is offered in silver or black finish.|$|R
50|$|The 14-speed Rohloff Speedhub hub gear, {{introduced}} in 1998, has a range exceeding 5 to 1, {{and is thus}} comparable in range to 24, 27 and 30-speed derailleur systems (with 3x8, 3x9 and 3x10 cogs front and rear), since the latter have three overlapping ranges often with only about 14 distinct gears. As there is no overlap with the Speedhub, the hub gear has only two shift directions (up and down), compared to <b>front</b> and rear <b>derailleur</b> gears where two shift operators with two shift directions are needed to shift through all gears.|$|R
2500|$|Most hybrid, touring, mountain, {{and racing}} {{bicycles}} {{are equipped with}} both <b>front</b> and rear <b>derailleurs.</b> [...] There are a few gear ratios which have a straight chain path, {{but most of the}} gear ratios will have the chain running at an angle. [...] The use of two derailleurs generally results in some duplicate or near duplicate gear ratios, so that the number of distinct gear ratios is typically around two-thirds of the number of advertised gear ratios. The more common configurations have specific names [...] which are usually related to the relative step sizes between the front chainrings and the rear cogset.|$|R
