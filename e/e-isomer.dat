50|$|Crotonaldehyde is a {{chemical}} compound with the formula CH3CH=CHCHO. The compound is usually {{sold as a}} mixture of the E- and Z-isomers, which differ {{with respect to the}} relative position of the methyl and formyl groups. The <b>E-isomer</b> is more common (data given in Table is for the <b>E-isomer).</b> This lachrymatory liquid is moderately soluble in water and miscible in organic solvents. As an unsaturated aldehyde, crotonaldehyde is a versatile intermediate in organic synthesis. It occurs in a variety of foodstuffs, e.g. soybean oils.|$|E
50|$|Another {{classic example}} {{is the use of}} a bulky Lewis acid to form the <b>E-isomer</b> of an ester over the {{preferred}} Z-isomer for cyclolactonization of medium rings. In one study, the addition of aluminum tris(2,6-diphenylphenoxide) (ATPH) was added to form a 7-membered lactone. The aluminum metal binds with the carbonyl oxygen forcing the bulky diphenylphenoxide groups in close proximity to the ester compound. As a result, the ester adopts the <b>E-isomer</b> to minimize penalizing steric interactions. Without the Lewis acid, only the 14-membered dimer ring was observed.|$|E

50|$|In RCM reactions, two {{possible}} geometric isomers, either E- or Z-isomer, may be formed. Stereoselectivity {{is dependent on}} the catalyst, ring strain, and starting diene. In smaller rings, Z-isomers predominate as the more stable product reflecting ring-strain minimization. In macrocycles, the <b>E-isomer</b> is often obtained {{as a result of the}} thermodynamic bias in RCM reactions as E-isomers are more stable compared to Z-isomers. As a general trend, ruthenium NHC (N-heterocyclic carbene) catalysts favor E selectivity to form the trans isomer. This in part due to the steric clash between the substituents, which adopt a trans configuration as the most stable conformation in the metallacyclobutane intermediate, to form the <b>E-isomer.</b> The synthesis of stereopure Z- isomers were previously achieved via ring-closing alkyne metathesis. However, in 2013 Grubbs reported the use of a chelating ruthenium catalyst to afford Z macrocycles in high selectivity. The selectivity is attributed to the increased steric clash between the catalyst ligands and the metallacyclobutane intermediate that is formed. The increased steric interactions in the transition state lead to the Z olefin rather than the E olefin, because the transition state required to form the E- isomer is highly disfavored.|$|E

The first RCM step was to form the 13-member D ring as solely the Z-isomer in 67% yield, a unique contrast to the usual favored <b>E-isomer</b> of metathesis. After further transformations, the second RCM was used to form the 8-member E ring in 26% yield using stoichiometric 1st Generation Grubbs catalyst.

30|$|OYE 2 p {{showed the}} highest {{specific}} activity at 40 °C and a pH optimum at 7.0 – 8.0. The stability of OYE 2 p was rather pH-independent, and the half-life time {{values of the}} enzyme at pH 6.0 – 8.0 were more than 257 h. With regard to the reduction of (E)-citral and (Z)-citral, OYE 2 p exhibited different selectivity patterns. (E)-citral was exclusively reduced to (R)-citronellal by OYE 2 p in ≥ 99 % ee, which was independent on pH. OYE 2 p produced both enantiomers of citronellal from (Z)-citral, but showed (R)-citronellal formation tendency, and the ee value of (R)-citronellal was affected by pH in the reaction system. Accordingly, the ee values for (R)-citronellal formation increased with the increasing levels of <b>E-isomer</b> in the (E/Z)-citral mixture {{as well as the}} increase of pH.

The chemical structure of the as-prepared isomers was identified by H- 1 NMR technique, IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis and X-ray diffraction. Photoconductivity measurements of both the isomers isolated and formulated as thin films on titanium substrates were performed by a solution deposition technique in a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) under different illumination conditions.

However, the Z-isomer presents higher photoconductivity compared with that of the <b>E-isomer.</b> So, it could be supposed that the lower photoresponse characterizing the <b>E-isomer</b> is due to an observed development of a non-traditional intramolecular hydrogen bond leading to the formation of an additional six-membered ring.
