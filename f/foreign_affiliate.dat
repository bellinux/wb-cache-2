40|$|This study uses new {{information}} {{to determine the}} role of <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> for productivity growth. The study has three aims. Firstly, the study quantifies the contribution of <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> to productivity growth in OECD countries using a growth accounting approach. Secondly, the analysis shows {{how much of this}} contribution derives from an increase in the employment share of <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> in the host country relative to an increase in productivity of existing <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates.</b> Thirdly, the study compares the presence of <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> across OECD countries. The information is derived by matching three OECD data sources: the STAN database for industrial analysis, the AFA (Activities of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Affiliates)</b> and FATS (<b>Foreign</b> <b>Affiliates</b> in Trade and Services) databases. Despite its limitations, this database provides longitudinal industry level information on both the presence and the productivity of <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> in OECD countries. The analysis confirms that <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> can make an important contribution to productivity growth. The contribution is larger in the manufacturing sector. In the services sector and in low-tech manufacturing sectors, the largest component of the contribution of <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> is mainly the increased employment share of <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates.</b> In medium and high tech sectors, the contribution is mainly driven by the larger growth of existing <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates...</b>|$|R

40|$|The relevance, {{nature and}} {{economic}} effects of innovation activities of transnational corporations are highly debated topics {{in the current}} literature on the “globalization of technology”.

The empirical evidence presented shows that <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> and domestic firms differ from each other {{more in terms of}} type of innovation strategies pursued than in terms of innovation performance.

The empirical investigation is carried out over a panel dataset covering the US bilateral transactions with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries for the period 1983 - 1998. The empirical specification is guided by a gravity-based model that accounts for trade and the operation of <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> as alternative modes of accessing foreign markets. The results show that the CUSFTA induced an increase in inward and outward trade between the US and Canada, but also led to a significant reduction in sales of their <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> in the corresponding CUSFTA partner country. This outcome implies that the trade-generating effect of the CUSFTA is overstated. free trade agreement, gravity, multinational enterprises, <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates,</b> trade,...|$|R

50|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) in its classic form {{is defined as}} a company from one country making a physical investment into building a factory in another country. It is the establishment of an enterprise by a foreigner. Its definition can be extended to include investments made to acquire lasting interest in enterprises operating outside of the economy of the investor. The FDI relationship consists of a parent enterprise and a <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliate</b> which together form a multinational corporation (MNC). In order to qualify as FDI the investment must afford the parent enterprise control over its <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliate.</b> The International Monetary Fund (IMF) defines control in this case as owning 10% or more of the ordinary shares or voting power of an incorporated firm or its equivalent for an unincorporated firm; lower ownership shares are known as portfolio investment.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} dividend remittances {{by a large}} {{panel of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> of U. S. multinational firms. The dividend policies of <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates,</b> which convey no signals to public capital markets, nevertheless resemble those used by publicly held companies in paying dividends to diffuse common shareholders. Robustness checks verify that dividend policies of <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> are little affected by the dividend policies of their parent companies or parent company exposure to public capital markets. Systematic differences in the payout behavior of affiliates that differ in organizational form, and those that face differing tax costs of paying dividends, reveal the importance of tax factors; nevertheless, dividend policies are not solely determined by tax considerations. The absence of capital market considerations and the incompleteness of tax explanations together suggest that dividend policies are largely driven {{by the need to}} control managers of <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates.</b> Parent firms are more willing to incur tax penalties by simultaneously investing funds while receiving dividends when their <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> are partially owned, located far from the United States, or in jurisdictions in which property rights are weak, all of which are implied by control theories of dividends. ...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} found that <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> of {{multinational}} enterprises (MNEs) suffer from liability of foreignness (LOF). <b>Foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> may be able to improve their social legitimacy and overcome LOF by demonstrating social commitment to host-country constituents through corporate social responsibility (CSR). If LOF is positively related to the distance between the home and host countries, and CSR activities confer social legitimacy benefits on <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates,</b> we should expect CSR activities and distance to be positively related. However, we argue that, despite this potential motivation, <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> from more distant home countries are in fact less likely to engage in host-country CSR. Our argument focuses on the ways in which distance affects the MNE's willingness and ability to engage in CSR abroad. We also predict that host-country CSR reputation negatively moderates this relationship. Using Community Reinvestment Act data for <b>foreign</b> bank <b>affiliates</b> from 32 countries in the United States over 1990 – 2007, we find strong support for our hypotheses.

The focal point of this thesis {{is to find out}} whether a positive relationship exists between the inflow of FDI and regional economic growth. To accomplish this, the relationship between growth in FDI and productivity growth is tested in three CEE countries, i. e. Poland, Hungary and Romania, divided in 31 NUTS II regions. Furthermore a case study of the Hungarian food sector is conducted to get {{a better understanding of the}} linkages between <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> and domestic companies. Overall, no positive relationship between FDI and productivity growth in the CEE countries has been found. In fact, the results illustrate that the growth in <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> correlates negatively with productivity growth. <b>Foreign</b> <b>affiliates</b> seem to have a competitive edge over domestic companies. However, this has not led to significant learning effects from vertical spillovers. Furthermore, knowledge spillovers may also occur through imitation even though companies are not always willing to share their knowledge with competitors.

Therefore attracting the most suitable <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates,</b> and creating for them the right conditions for developing and providing complements, may be as strategically important as market choice or entry mode choice. Management may have to ask questions such as “do we have enough suitable developers providing applications in Spanish?” and “How can we bring in more French content providers?”. Such questions may be as important as the question “should we enter Spain before or after we enter France?”. It seems that a platform provider striving to internationalize will have to make additional strategic choices (compared with the choices the classic organizational form entails). Choosing <b>foreign</b> <b>affiliates,</b> and choosing (creating) the right conditions for them to develop and provide complementary offerings, seems to be critical to the success of the internationalization process of the platform provider.|$|R
