5|$|A {{conspiracy}} trial presents complicated {{questions of}} {{strategy for the}} defense. There are advantages and disadvantages in having separate counsel for each defendant or a single counsel for more than one. Joint representation {{is a means of}} <b>insuring</b> against reciprocal recrimination. A common defense often gives strength against a common attack.|$|E
5|$|After his Nashville Predators {{failed to}} make the Stanley Cup playoffs, Weber was {{considered}} a lock for the 2013 World Championship team, but Hockey Canada deemed the cost of <b>insuring</b> his large NHL contract too high and ultimately did not select him.|$|E
5|$|Female {{birds have}} sperm storage {{mechanisms}} that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and <b>insuring</b> against {{the possibility of}} infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.|$|E
40|$|The sum <b>insured</b> of <b>insured</b> assets {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{significant}} characteristics of insurance policy quality and is the ceiling amount of insurance benefit {{in the case of an}} <b>insured</b> loss. It {{is one of the}} parameters specified in the policy and affects the premium amount. The sum <b>insured</b> relates to the <b>insured</b> value of the asset. It is the highest possible loss which can occur to an <b>insured</b> loss and it is decisive for determining the sum <b>insured.</b> The policy holder determines the sum <b>insured</b> so that it corresponds to the <b>insured</b> value of the <b>insured</b> asset at the time of insurance policy signing. The policy holder is fully liable for setting the sum <b>insured.</b> The aim of this paper was to analyze the quality of the underwritten insurance according to the determined sum <b>insured.</b> Source data for the paper included critical analysis of literature based on valid Czech legislation and on general terms and conditions of insurance of individual insurance companies. The paper contains an analysis and comparison of types of <b>insured</b> values of assets for insurance needs on the Czech insurance market. An induction method applied to a real-life insurance case was used for explanation of the relationship between the sum <b>insured</b> and paid-out insurance benefit. The paper clarifies the significance and characteristics of the sum <b>insured</b> in the Czech Republic. The conclusion is that viewing insurance only from the angle of the premium amount is completely incorrect. Savings on the premium at the expense of reduction of the sum <b>insured</b> implies a risk of not renewing company operations or a living in a family house in case of an <b>insured</b> loss. ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>insured</b> {{must prove}} that an {{insurable}} interest existed {{in order to}} prove loss. The test is whether the <b>insured</b> will incur financial loss, or will fail to derive an anticipated financial benefit, if the event <b>insured</b> against occurs. In principle, the object of insurance must be in existence {{at the time of the}} occurrence of the peril <b>insured</b> against. If the <b>insured</b> has no interest at the time of the occurrence of the event <b>insured</b> against, he cannot suffer any loss or damage. Since the function of insurable interest is to determine whether the <b>insured</b> has suffered a loss, the insured’s interest, by virtue of the terms of the contract, must exist at the time of the materialisation of the peril <b>insured</b> against. If the <b>insured</b> does not possess an interest at that crucial time, there is no object secured by the insurance. Consequently, the <b>insured</b> can bring no claim under the contract for loss suffered.|$|R
50|$|The KDIC <b>insures</b> bank {{deposits}}, customer's deposits for securities trading, individual insurance policies, etc. On {{the other}} hand, the KDIC does not <b>insure</b> CDs, RPs, securities, CPs, etc. Also, the deposit insurance excludes deposits by government and <b>insured</b> financial institutions, etc. from its <b>insured</b> products.|$|R
5|$|On 1 August 2006, CNN {{reported}} that Barney, a Doberman Pinscher {{employed as a}} security dog at Wookey Hole, had destroyed parts of a valuable collection of teddy bears, including one which had belonged to Elvis Presley, which {{was estimated to be}} worth £40,000 (US$75,000). The insurance company <b>insuring</b> the exhibition of stuffed animals had insisted on having guard dog protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandate and}} the limits on open {{enrollment}} were designed to avoid the insurance death spiral in which healthy people delay <b>insuring</b> themselves until they get sick. In such a situation, insurers would have to raise their premiums to cover the relatively sicker and thus more expensive policies, which could create a vicious cycle in which {{more and more people}} drop their coverage.|$|E
5|$|Although the 2012 Olympic men's {{basketball}} tournament was then {{more than a}} year away, qualifying tournaments in all five of FIBA's continental zones were to be held in the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2011 (the traditional basketball offseason throughout the world). The lockout resulted in the suspension of an agreement between the NBA and FIBA by which the NBA would take on most of the costs for <b>insuring</b> the value of its players' contracts in the event they were injured during international competition. As a result, national federations that wish to have NBA players on their squads must now provide full coverage instead of supplemental insurance.|$|E
50|$|Over-insurance {{occurs when}} the sum <b>insured</b> {{is greater than the}} loss that the <b>insured</b> would suffer if the risk materialises. For example, a house is <b>insured</b> for R200,000, but its market value is R150,000. Even here, the <b>insured</b> may not recover more than the loss he {{actually}} suffers.|$|R
50|$|Compulsory <b>insured</b> and {{voluntary}} <b>insured</b> {{people of the}} public health insurance are compulsorily <b>insured</b> in the social insurance. Voluntarily <b>insured</b> people have the possibility to switch to the private care insurance, which also include the fully <b>insured</b> people of the private health insurance. The spouse and children of members of social care insurance are entitled to premium-free family insurance. With this system, a cover for the entire population was introduced.|$|R
25|$|The <b>insured</b> {{receives}} a contract, called the insurance policy, which details the conditions and {{circumstances under which}} the <b>insured</b> will be financially compensated. The amount of money charged by the insurer to the <b>insured</b> for the coverage {{set forth in the}} insurance policy is called the premium. If the <b>insured</b> experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the <b>insured</b> submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster.|$|R
5|$|Registered Nurses: Registered {{nurses are}} {{responsible}} for coordinating {{all aspects of the}} patient's care and <b>insuring</b> symptoms (physical or otherwise) are being addressed and managed. The primary care nurse visits a minimum of twice weekly, and the content of the visit can vary greatly. When patients are experiencing few symptoms and/or are early in their diseases, the RN visit may just be a short check up. If a patient's symptoms worsen, the nurse will visit more often, make recommendations for increasing or changing the medication intervention and provide support and education regarding the disease/dying process. Many patients on hospice may require complex treatments: respiratory care, wound care or even IV therapy at home. In most cases, the hospice nurse is trained to handle these unique needs as well.|$|E
5|$|These {{costs are}} {{surprisingly}} high—one agent who represents an unnamed NBA player set to earn $10 {{million in the}} 2010–11 season said the player had received a $400,000 quote to insure his contract for his national team's FIBA qualifier. The Spanish Basketball Federation said that <b>insuring</b> all the NBA players on its national team for EuroBasket 2011, which doubles as the European Olympic qualifiers, could {{cost as much as}} $5.67 million. Basketball Australia announced that Andrew Bogut would not be available for the 2011 FIBA Oceania Championship; his agent indicated that the final deal-breaker was when insurers stated that they would not insure his remaining $39 million in NBA salary unless pre-existing elbow, wrist, and back injuries were excluded from the policy.|$|E
5|$|Raphel {{entered her}} State Department {{assignment}} {{at a time}} when U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained. Sanctions imposed by George H. W. Bush over concerns about Pakistan's burgeoning nuclear program under the Pressler Amendment banned all military ties, supply of military hardware and jet fighters, and cut off political relations with Islamabad. Bhutto sought rapprochement with the Clinton White House, and Raphel became a key player in orchestrating the renewal of ties, visiting the United States in April 1995. Raphel, working with Pakistan's envoy to Washington at the time, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, helped craft administration policy changes and build Congressional support that would ultimately become law through repeal of the Pressler Amendment. The Brown Amendment was put into effect in November 1995. It restored U.S.-Pakistan relations and allowed Raphel to proceed apace in executing U.S. energy objectives in the region, now with new-found support from the Pakistani military for restoring military-to-military ties and its civilian government for <b>insuring</b> return of funds paid by Pakistan to the United States for undelivered F-16 fighter jets.|$|E
5000|$|For instance, in vehicle {{insurance}} {{a typical}} Personal Auto Policy will cover {{not only the}} original named <b>insured</b> that purchased the auto policy, but will also cover additional persons while they are driving the auto with permission of the named <b>insured.</b> This is a simple type of blanket additional insurance arrangement, {{because it does not}} identify the additional <b>insured</b> by name, but by a [...] "blanket" [...] general description that will automatically apply to many persons. Similarly, in liability insurance, all directors, officers, and employees of a named <b>insured</b> company will also enjoy the status of being an <b>insured,</b> so long as they are acting in their capacity of carrying out the business of the named <b>insured</b> company. These persons enjoy <b>insured</b> status only while they pursue the business of the named <b>insured.</b> If they deviate to pursue their own affairs, they lose this extension of coverage. This extension of coverage to people with a constant and close relationship to the named <b>insured</b> company is accomplished via the [...] "Who Is An Insured" [...] section of the liability policy. In other cases, the original named <b>insured</b> wishes to extend coverage to others who would not come within these standard categories. To extend coverage further, Additional <b>Insured</b> Endorsements are added to the policy.|$|R
40|$|Germany has a {{two-tier system}} of {{statutory}} and primary private health insurance. Both insurance types provide fee-for-service insurance, but chargeable fees for identical services {{are more than}} twice as large for privately <b>insured</b> as for statutorily <b>insured</b> patients. Using German SOEP 2002 data, I analyze the effect of insurance status on the insured's number of doctor visits. Conditional on health, privately <b>insured</b> patients are less likely to contact a physician than publicly <b>insured</b> but more frequently visit a doctor following a first contact. This is indirect evidence for the hypothesis that physicians over-treat privately <b>insured</b> patients at least relative to the statutorily <b>insured.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Employees' Old-Age Benefits Institution {{provides}} following {{benefits to}} the <b>insured</b> person or its survivors. An <b>insured</b> person typically becomes eligible to get pension after reaching the age of 60 and completing 15 years of <b>insured</b> service.|$|R
25|$|Soon after incorporating, INA {{entered the}} field of fire {{insurance}}. While Philadelphia already had two fire insurance companies--The Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire (1752) and the Mutual Assurance Company for <b>Insuring</b> Houses from Loss by Fire in and near Philadelphia (1784)--INA was different. The existing fire insurance companies, being an outgrowth of volunteer firefighting associations, only insured buildings from loss. INA, with its marine insurance origins, introduced the concept of <b>insuring</b> {{the contents of the}} buildings as well.|$|E
25|$|In 1870, {{a society}} was founded for <b>insuring</b> the workers, for a low monthly fee, {{augmented}} by the king. The heirs of construction casualties (30 cases are {{mentioned in the}} statistics) received a small pension.|$|E

50|$|Since 1934, the FHA and HUD have <b>insured</b> over 34 million home {{mortgages}} and 47,205 multifamily project mortgages. Currently, the FHA has 4.8 million <b>insured</b> single family {{mortgages and}} 13,000 <b>insured</b> multifamily projects in its portfolio.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of capital or non-indemnity insurance, the insurer {{undertakes}} to pay to the <b>insured</b> a specified amount, or periodical amounts, upon the happening of the event <b>insured</b> against: for example, R5,000 if the <b>insured</b> dies or loses a limb. This is generally non-patrimonial loss. On the face of it, the contract does not purport to indemnify the <b>insured</b> against patrimonial loss.|$|R

25|$|The Czech region {{had a more}} {{advanced}} economy, but was reluctant to support the war effort. Czechs rejected any customs union with Germany, because it threatened their language and culture. Czech bankers had an eye to early independence; they purchased many securities from the Czech lands, thus <b>insuring</b> their strong domestic position in what became Czechoslovakia in 1918.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later, Lehman Brothers began to falter. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, who in July had {{publicly}} {{expressed concern that}} continuous bailouts would lead to moral hazard, decided to let Lehman fail. The fallout from Lehman's failure snowballed into market-wide panic. AIG, an insurance company, had sold credit default swaps <b>insuring</b> against Lehman's failure {{under the assumption that}} such a failure was extremely unlikely.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} New Deal {{following}} the Great Depression, the US federal government created the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) with the National Housing Act of 1934 {{to assist in the}} construction, acquisition, and rehabilitation of residential properties. The FHA helped develop and standardize the fixed-rate mortgage {{as an alternative to the}} balloon payment mortgage by <b>insuring</b> them, and helped the mortgage design garner usage.|$|E
50|$|Secondly, {{after paying}} out under {{a policy of}} {{indemnity}} insurance, an insurer may be entitled to sue the <b>insured</b> where the <b>insured</b> has already made good his loss. That is, the insurer has a claim against the <b>insured</b> so as {{to ensure that the}} <b>insured</b> does not get double recovery. This situation might arise if, for example, an <b>insured</b> claimed in full under the policy, but then started proceedings against the third party tortfeasor, and recovered substantial damages. Strictly speaking, this is not a case of subrogation; it is a case of recoupment.|$|R
50|$|The {{individual}} or legal entity is authorized to represent an <b>insured</b> {{party in the}} purchase, servicing, and maintenance of insurance coverage with a designated insurer. The majority of insurance companies will not disclose any information or discuss an <b>insured</b> party's account with any agent other than the duly appointed agent of record. An <b>insured</b> party wishing to change insurance agent(s) must submit a revised agent of record letter to the respective insurer authorizing said insurer to release the <b>insured</b> party's information and to discuss the <b>insured</b> party's coverage with the newly appointed agent.|$|R
50|$|Coverage F - Medical Payments: Designed to pay {{for medical}} {{expenses}} to others who are accidentally injured on an <b>insured</b> location or by the activities of an <b>insured,</b> resident employee, or an animal owned by or {{in the care of}} an <b>insured.</b> These payments are not based on the law of negligence; that is, no negligence {{on the part of the}} <b>insured</b> has to be proven for payment to be made.|$|R
25|$|In the United States, {{the tax on}} {{interest}} income on life insurance policies and annuities is generally deferred. However, {{in some cases the}} benefit derived from tax deferral may be offset by a low return. This depends upon the <b>insuring</b> company, the type of policy and other variables (mortality, market return, etc.). Moreover, other income tax saving vehicles (e.g., IRAs, 401(k) plans, Roth IRAs) may be better alternatives for value accumulation.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{function}} of medieval hospitals was to worship to God. Most hospitals contained one chapel, {{at least one}} clergyman, and inmates that were expected to help with prayer. Worship was often a higher priority than care and was {{a large part of}} hospital life until and long after the Reformation. Worship in medieval hospitals served as a way of alleviating ailments of the sick and <b>insuring</b> their salvation when relief from sickness could not be achieved.|$|E
25|$|Large {{number of}} similar {{exposure}} units: Since insurance operates through pooling resources, {{the majority of}} insurance policies are provided for individual members of large classes, allowing insurers {{to benefit from the}} law of large numbers in which predicted losses are similar to the actual losses. Exceptions include Lloyd's of London, which is famous for <b>insuring</b> the life or health of actors, sports figures, and other famous individuals. However, all exposures will have particular differences, which may lead to different premium rates.|$|E
