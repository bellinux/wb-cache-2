The treatment plant received {{a high proportion of}} industrial effluent and the sludge averaged about 200 ppm Cd (dry weight). Corn grain harvested from the plots in 1974 was fed to growing swine for 56 days, and other swine were permitted to forage on the plots during the winters of 1975 - 76 and 1976 - 77. The sludge-fertilized corn contained higher concentrations of nutrient and toxic elements, but did not interfere with swine performance. Minor changes in hepatic microsomal oxidases and red blood cells accompanied significant increases in renal Cd and decreases in hepatic Fe. Swine foraging on these plots ingested considerable amounts of sludge soil and accumulated significantly higher concentrations of renal Cd.

40|$|International audienceSludge washout {{is listed}} {{among the top}} {{practical}} problems of the high rate upflow anaerobic reactors. This study investigated quantitatively two sludge washout processes operated under different hydrodynamic shear increase modes with the intervals of 1 and 10 days respectively. The results reveal that the sludge washout accompanying with large-scale granule disruption could lead to performance failure with <b>heavy</b> <b>sludge</b> loss ratio of about 46. 1 % at sludge loss rate about 0. 35 gVSS L- 1 d(- 1) during the process with shear increase interval of 1 day, while the highest sludge loss rate was only 0. 12 gVSS L- 1 d(- 1) during the process with 10 -day interval. The intensified shear conditions could weaken the granules through inhibiting the extracellular polymers production and bioactivity. As consequences, an outbreak of large-scale granule disruption would raise and then significantly accelerate the sludge washout. Since long interval could provide the granules the opportunity to recover from these negative effects to some extent, the shear increase strategy of long interval over 10 days is favorably recommended to operate full-scale reactors during the start-up and shock load periods. The pioneer use of the micro particle image velocimetry in this study offers the possibility to discover the real hydrodynamic conditions around granules at microscale {{for the first time}} and reveals that the shear force exerts directly on the granular surface as a mechanical disruption force and big granules undergo high disruption force. The granule disruption is a result of the competition between the granule and the ambient hydrodynamic shear conditions rather than a process with shear force as a sole dominant factor. These could facilitate the understanding of the complicated interactions between the hydrodynamics and reactor performance and favor then a better control of the full-scale reactors...|$|E

The initial stages of the formation of anaerobic granules follow the same principles as biofilm formation of bacteria on solid surfaces. There exist strong evidence that inert carriers play an important positive role in granulation. Most researchers conclude that Methanosaeta concilii is a key organism in granulation. Only the Cape Town Hypothesis presumes that an autotrophic hydrogenotrophic organism, i. e., Methanobacterium strain AZ, growing under conditions of high H- 2 -pressures, is the key organism in granulation. Many authors focus on the initial stage of granulation, and only a few contributions discuss the latter stages in granulation: granule maturation and multiplication.

40|$|It was {{discovered}} in a Korean PWR that an extensive number of very short and shallow cracks in the SG tubes were undetectable by eddy current in-service-inspection because of the masking effect of sludge deposits. Axial stress corrosion cracks at the outside diameter of the steam generator tubes near the line contacts with the tube support plates are the major concern among the six identical Korean nuclear power plants having CE-type steam generators with Alloy 600 high temperature mill annealed tubes, HU 3 & 4 and HB 3 ∼ 6. The tubes in HB 3 & 4 have a less susceptible microstructure so that the onset of ODSCC was substantially delayed compared to HU 3 & 4 whose tubes are most susceptible to ODSCC among the six units. The numbers of cracks detected by the eddy current inspection jumped drastically after the steam generators of HB 4 were chemically cleaned. The purpose of the chemical cleaning was to mitigate stress corrosion cracking by removing the <b>heavy</b> <b>sludge</b> deposit, since a corrosive environment is formed in the occluded region under the sludge deposit. SGCC also enhances the detection capability of the eddy current inspection at the same time. Measurement {{of the size of}} each crack using the motorized rotating pancake coil probe indicated that the cracks in HB 4 were shorter and substantially shallower than the cracks in HU 3 & 4. It is believed that the cracks were shorter and shallower because the microstructure of the tubes in HB 4 is less susceptible to ODSCC. It was readily understood from the size distribution of the cracks and the quantitative information available on the probability of detection that most cracks in HB 4 had been undetected until the steam generators were chemically cleaned...|$|E

40|$|A {{full-scale}} modular solid/liquid separation (SLS) {{system was}} designed, fabricated, installed, and successfully deployed {{for treatment of}} liquid low-level waste from the Melton Valley Storage Tanks (MVSTs) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The SLS module, utilizing cross-flow filtration, was operated {{as part of an}} integrated tank waste pretreatment system (otherwise known as the Wastewater Triad) to remove suspended solids and prevent fouling of ion-exchange materials and heat exchange surfaces. The information gained from this testing was used to complete design specifications for the full-scale modular SLS system in May 1997. The contract for detailed design and fabrication of the system was awarded to NUMET in July 1997, and the design was completed in January 1998. Fabrication began in March 1998, and the completed system was delivered to ORNL on December 29, 1998. Installation of the system at the MVST facility was completed in May 1999. After completing an operational readiness assessment, approval was given to commence hot operations on June 7, 1999. Operations involving two of the eight MVSTs were performed safely and with very little unscheduled downtime. Filtration of supernatant from tank W- 31 was completed on June 24, 1999 and W- 26 processing was completed on August 20, 1999. The total volume processed during these two campaigns was about 45, 000 gal. The suspended solids content of the liquid processed from tank W- 31 was lower than expected, resulting in higher-than-expected filtrate production for nearly the entire operation. The liquid processed from tank W- 26 was higher in suspended solids content, and filtrate production was lower, but comparable to the rates expected {{based on the results of}} previous pilot-scale, single-element filtration tests. The quality of the filtrate consistently met the requirements for feed to the downstream ion-exchange and evaporation processes. From an equipment and controls standpoint, the modular system (pumps, valves, sensors, monitors, controls, shielding, and containment) functioned very well during each campaign. Evaluation of the Endress+Hauser Promass 63 F Mass Flowmeter (a secondary objective of the project) indicated reasonably accurate and reliable performance. This instrument was installed on the feed pipeline for the SLS system, and it provided very accurate mass flow and density data, and reasonably accurate solids content data. Near the end of tank W- 31 processing, the solids content of the feed to the SLS system increased to a very high concentration. This behavior was caused by the increased mixing of liquid and sludge phases within MVST Tank 31 as the level of liquid being decanted from the tank approached the level of the settled sludge. The physical properties of the <b>heavy</b> <b>sludge</b> caused some difficulties in draining and flushing of the system. Other minor equipment problems were encountered, but none resulted in significant downtime or safety issues. Operational data collected during the campaign were useful in evaluating the performance of the system. The 50 -ft{sup 2 } cross-flow filter was designed to provide filtrate at the rate of 1 to 5 gal/min (flux range of 0. 02 to 0. 1 gal min{sup - 1 } ft{sup - 2 }) of filtrate, and actual production was between 0. 6 and 8. 0 gal/min (flux range of 0. 012 to 0. 16 gal min{sup - 1 } ft{sup - 2 }). Additional operating data will be needed, however, to assess the long-term performance of the system with wider variations in the composition of the tank waste feed.

After the stirring and resting times took place, pH and conductivity were registered finding that SAl and SFe either with or without polymers are the coagulants producing the higher pH drop. Conductivity measures also establish two kind of data since higher conductivity (about 2000) was observed for SAl, and PIX, PIX + CP, PIX + AP; otherwise a conductivity about 1300 was observed for SAl + PC, SFe and PAX alone and with CP or AP.

However, trace or heavy metals present in sludge pose the risk of human or phytotoxicity from land application. Long-term use of sewage <b>sludge,</b> <b>heavy</b> metals can accumulate to phytotoxic levels and results in reduced plants growth and/or enhanced metal concentrations in plants, which consumed by animals then enter the food chain. In this research, the amount of heavy metals was measured in plants irrigated with wastewater and sludge application. For this purpose, three pilots were made in a Shush treatment plant in south of Tehran. Three plants species, spinach, lettuce and radish were selected and planted in the pilots. First pilot was irrigated just with wastewater of treatment plant and second pilot was irrigated with wastewater and sludge application. Third pilot was irrigated with simulated heavy metals solution equal 50 years of irrigation. The results indicate that the average of amount of heavy metals Pb, Cd in three plant species in first pilot were lower than permissible limits. In second pilot, Cadmium accumulations are high in three species plants and more than the standard limits. Concentration of Cd, Pb have exceed their permitted limits in plants in third pilot.

The objective was a comprehensive characterization of the process, including both operational (sludge reduction efficiency, pollution removal, fate of micropollutants, cost analysis) and more fundamental aspects (microbial community evolutions). Thermal disintegration effectively decreased sludge production by 30 % when comparing results with control reactor running in parallel. However, the solubilization of sludge compounds and the decrease of VSS concentration in the aeration tank led to a higher organic load in the reactors. This affected the overall treatment performances: COD and TSS removal efficiencies were decreased by 15 %. The loss of nitrification efficiency was evidenced in the treated line and was linked with bacterial community modifications (evidenced by PCR-DGGE techniques). The similarity percentage between the control and the thermally treated sludge was equal to 59 % after 9 weeks.

The results of physicochemical analyzes, performed over a period of three years, show that the treated effluent, has a slightly alkalinity (pH = 7. 52), annual average concentrations of 20. 15 mg/l total nitrogen from 11. 30 mg/l total phosphorus and 19. 35 mg/l of total potassium. The determination of the parameters measured pollution indicators gives average: BOD 5 = 28. 32 mg/l, COD = 44. 50 mg/l, MES = 14. 20 mg/l. The concentrations of <b>heavy</b> metals in <b>sludge</b> from these waters are: Cr = 74. 2 m...|$|R
40|$|Background: High {{amount of}} <b>heavy</b> metals in <b>sludge</b> {{is one of}} the major {{obstacles}} to its use on farms. The present study aimed to investigate the possibility of leaching heavy metals from wastewater sludge by Fenton method and determine the optimum level of parameters, such as iron, hydrogen peroxide, time, and pH for Fenton reaction. Methods: The effects of various parameters, such as pH (2 - 9), hydrogen peroxide concentration (0. 5 - 6 g/l), Fe concentration (0. 5 - 4 g/l), and leaching time (5 - 60 min), were studied. Results: The results showed that the optimal condition for leaching of heavy metals occurred at pH of 2 - 3, hydrogen peroxide concentration of 3 g/l, iron concentration of 2 g/l, and leaching time of 15 min. Under these optimal conditions, 92...|$|R
40|$|Fly ash and slag {{that result}} from {{combustion}} of coal in thermal power plants are important environmental problems; because they contain <b>heavy</b> metals. Sewage <b>sludge</b> that is an ultimate product of wastewater treatment contains pollutants removed from wastewater and these pollutants limits its beneficial usage. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the leachability of some heavy metals from fly ash and slag of power plant and wastewater treatment sludge by Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) and American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) methods. According to TCLP and ASTM results found that the heavy metal concentrations leached to solutions after leaching of the wastes were higher than the limits given by regulation. It was determined that important pollution can be seen as a result of the leaching of these wastes...|$|R
