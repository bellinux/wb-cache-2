40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 9 APR 2008 Genetic parameters for carcass and meat quality traits of about 18 -month-old Merino rams (n = 5870), the progeny of 543 sires from three research resource flocks, were estimated. The estimates of heritability for hot carcass weight (HCW) {{and the various}} fat and muscle dimension measurements were moderate and ranged from 0. 20 to 0. 37. The brightness of meat (colour L*, 0. 18 ± 0. 03 standard error) and meat pH (0. 22 ± 0. 03) also had moderate estimates of heritability, although meat relative redness (colour a*, 0. 10 ± 0. 03) and relative yellowness (colour b*, 0. 10 ± 0. 03) were lower. Heritability estimates for live weights were moderate and ranged from 0. 29 to 0. 41 with significant permanent maternal environmental effects (0. 13 to 0. 10). The heritability estimates for the <b>hogget</b> <b>wool</b> traits were moderate to high and ranged from 0. 27 to 0. 60. The ultrasound measurements of fat depth (FATUS) and eye muscle depth (EMDUS) on live animals were highly genetically correlated with the corresponding carcass measurements (0. 69 ± 0. 09 FATC and 0. 77 ± 0. 07 EMD). Carcass tissue depth (FATGR) had moderate to low genetic correlations with carcass muscle measurements [0. 18 ± 0. 10 EMD and 0. 05 ± 0. 10 eye muscle area (EMA) ], while those with FATC were negative. The genetic correlation between EMD and eye muscle width (EMW) was 0. 41 ± 0. 08, while EMA was highly correlated with EMD (0. 89 ± 0. 0) and EMW (0. 78 ± 0. 04). The genetic correlations for muscle colour with muscle measurements were moderately negative, while those with fat measurements were close to zero. Meat pH {{was positively correlated with}} muscle measurements (0. 14 to 0. 17) and negatively correlated with fat measurements (− 0. 06 to − 0. 18). EMDUS also showed a similar pattern of correlations to EMD with meat quality indicator traits, although FATUS had positive correlations with these traits which were generally smaller than their standard error. The genetic correlations among the meat colour traits were high and positive while those with meat pH were high and negative, which were all in the favourable direction. Generally, phenotypic correlations were similar or slightly lower than the corresponding genetic correlations. There were generally small to moderate negative genetic correlations between clean fleece weight (CFW) and carcass fat traits while those with muscle traits were close to zero. As the Merino is already a relatively lean breed, this implies that particular attention should be given to this relationship in Merino breeding programmes to prevent the reduction of fat reserves as a correlated response to selection for increased fleece weight. The ultrasound scan traits generally showed a similar pattern to the corresponding carcass fat and muscle traits. There was a small unfavourable genetic correlation between CFW and meat pH (0. 19 ± 0. 07). J. C. Greeff, E. Safari, N. M. Fogarty, D. L. Hopkins, F. D. Brien, K. D. Atkins, S. I. Mortimer and J. H.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{maintenance}} v, submaintenance diets of pregnant ewes in 1991 and 1992 on {{establishment of the}} wool follicle population in their progeny, {{and its effect on}} the progeny's wool production (quantity, quality and variation across the body of the animal) to 1. 4 years of age was examined. The experimental protocol used cloned animals created by bisecting embryos at day 6 of pregnancy. Each clone was placed in a ewe, which was subsequently fed from about day 50 to 140 of pregnancy at maintenance or submaintenance. Ewes on maintenance nutrition maintained liveweight throughout pregnancy, while submaintenance ewes were 12. 1 kg lighter (P< 0. 001) 10 days before lambing. In 1991, a total of 74 lambs were born, including 17 sets of surviving clones. In 1992, 102 lambs were born, including 18 sets of surviving clones. Only data for the 35 sets of genetically identical 'twin' progeny and their dams are reported. Birth weights of lambs born to ewes fed at the submaintenance rate were 0. 5 kg lighter (P< 0. 01) than their 'twins' born to ewes fed at maintenance. Midside secondary:primary (Sf: Pf) ratios for mature wool follicles were less (P< 0. 01) at birth, lamb and hogget shearing (1. 4, 1. 5 and 2. 1 units respectively) for the progeny born to ewes fed at submaintenance. Progeny from ewes on the submaintenance treatment produced less clean wool, 0. 1 kg to 0. 4 years of age (P< 0. 01) and 0. 14 kg between 0. 4 and 1. 4 years of age (P = 0. 10), than their maintenance counterparts. <b>Hogget</b> <b>wool</b> was 0. 1 pm broader (P< 0. 05), with a 0. 5 % units lower coefficient of variation of fibre diameter (P< 0. 01), and a position of break closer to the staple tip (P< 0. 001) for progeny of submaintenance ewes than their maintenance counterparts. There {{were no significant differences in}} yield, staple length, staple strength and percentage of fibres greater than 30 pm in diameter. Differences in mean fibre diameter arose between 1 and 1. 4 years of age, coinciding with the period that the animals were grazing high quality pasture. Effects of maternal undernutrition on mean fibre diameter and Sf: Pf follicle ratios of progeny were most pronounced on the hind leg (P< 0. 01), and not significant on the front leg. However, variations in other wool quality traits across the body of the hoggets, expressed as a percentage of the midside value, were not significantly affected by maternal undernutrition. Clearly when evaluating management strategies for the pregnant ewe, the effect on lifetime production and quality of wool of their progeny needs to be considered. Merino hoggets that produce an extra 0. 14 kg clean wool that is 0. 1 pm finer will compensate for some extra management and feeding of their dams during pregnancy to prevent weight loss. If these effects continue throughout the life of the animal, then it will increase the cost effectiveness of feeding to maintain maternal weight over pregnancy. R. W. Kelly, I. Macleod, P. Hynd and J. Greef...|$|E
50|$|Merino wool is {{typically}} 3-5 {{inches in length}} and is very fine (between 12 and 24 microns). The finest and most valuable wool comes from Merino <b>hoggets.</b> <b>Wool</b> taken from sheep produced for meat {{is typically}} more coarse, and has fibers 1.5 to 6 in in length. Damage or breaks in the wool can occur if the sheep is stressed while it is growing its fleece, resulting in a thin spot where the fleece is likely to break.|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} been carried out to compare the wool {{producing}} ability of the Corriedale hoggets with that of the Corriedale F 1 cross hoggets that were produced by crossing the Corriedale on the other breeds of sheep to create a new type of sheep for mutton and lamb production in Japan. The F 1 cross hoggets used for the comparison of the wool producing ability, wool yield and characters of 5 Corriedale hoggets were 6 Corriedale × Southdown, 6 Corriedale × Romney Marsh and 3 corriedale × Border Leicester F 1 cross <b>hoggets.</b> <b>Wool</b> yields(grease fleece and clean fleece yield) and wool characters(wool fineness, stretched length of wool, number of crimps and wool density) at about 9 months after birth between the Corriedale and F 1 cross hoggets born in spring were compared in 1959 and 1960. The results obtained are summarized as follows; (1) No significant differences in grease fleece and clean fleece yield between the Corriedale breed and F 1 crosses were observed. However, the fleece yields of the Romney Marsh and Border Leicester F 1 crosses were higher than the Corriedale breed, while the fleece yield of the Southdown F 1 cross lower than the Corriedale breed. (2) There {{was no significant difference in}} the wool fineness between the Corriedale breed and F 1 crosses, except in the wool fineness(significant at 0. 1 % level) between the Corriedale breed and Border Leicester Fl cross. The wool fineness of the Romney Marsh and Border Leicester F 1 crosses was greater than the Morrisdale breed, while the wool fineness of the Southdown F 1 cross a little smaller than the Corriedale breed. (3) Difference in the stretched length of wool between the Corriedale breed and F 1 crosses, except in the stretched length of wool(significant at 1 % level) between the Corriedale breed and Southdown Fl cross, was not significant. The stretched length of the Romney marsh and Border Leicester F 1 crosses was greater than the Corriedale breed, while the stretched length of the Southdown F 1 cross smaller than the Corriedale breed. (4) The numbers of crimps of the Coriedale breed, and Romney Marsh and Border Leicester F 1 crosses were significantly different at 0. 1 % and 1 % levels. The number of crimps in the Corriedale breed was the largest, while the difference in the crimp number between the Corriedale breed and F 1 crosses was considerably small. (5) The wool density showed no significant difference between the Corriedale breed and Southdown F 1 cross, while a significant difference was seen at 5 % and 0. 1 % levels between the Corriedale breed and Romney Marsh and Border Leicester F 1 crosses. The wool density of the Corriedale breed was smaller than the South down and Romney Marsh F 1 crosses, but greater than the Border Leicester F 1 cross...|$|R
40|$|The study {{estimated}} heritability for lamb {{growth and}} carcass performance, <b>hogget</b> ewe <b>wool</b> production, and worm egg count among crossbred progeny of maternal breed sires, {{as well as}} the genetic and phenotypic correlations among the traits. The data were from crossbred progeny of 91 sires from maternal breeds including Border Leicester, East Friesian, Finnsheep, Coopworth, White Suffolk, Corriedale, and Booroola Leicester. The sires were mated to Merino ewes at 3 sites over 3 years (and also Corriedale ewes at one site), with 3 common sires used at each site and year to provide genetic links. These sheep comprised part of the national maternal sire central progeny test program (MCPT) to evaluate the genetic variation for economically important production traits in progeny of maternal and dual-purpose (meat and wool) sires and the scope for genetic improvement. The matings resulted in 7846 first-cross lambs born, with 2964 wether lambs slaughtered at an average age of 214 days, and wool data from 2795 hogget ewes. Data were analysed using univariate mixed models containing fixed effects for site, year, sex and type of birth and rearing, dam source and sire breed, and random terms for sire and dam effects. Heritabilities and genetic correlations were estimated based on variances from progeny of 70 sires by fitting the same mixed models using a REML procedure in univariate and multivariate analyses. Estimates of heritability were low for lamb growth traits (0. 07 – 0. 29), meat colour and meat pH (0. 10 – 0. 23), and faecal worm egg count (0. 10), moderate for carcass fat and muscle traits (0. 32 – 0. 47), and moderate to high for wool traits (0. 36 – 0. 55). Estimates of direct genetic correlations among liveweights at various ages were high and positive (0. 41 – 0. 77) and those between liveweights and most carcass and meat quality traits were small and varied in sign. Liveweights were moderately to highly positively correlated with most wool traits, except fibre diameter (– 0. 28 – 0. 08). The study indicates that there is genetic variation for wool, growth, carcass, and meat quality traits, as well as for faecal worm egg count, with scope for selection within Australian maternal sire breeds of sheep...|$|R
40|$|A grazing {{experiment}} was conducted for 116 days from 19 January to 15 May {{in the late}} summer/autumn of 2006 at Massey University's Riverside dryland Farm, near Masterton (New Zealand) to compare the effect of grazing willow fodder blocks or control perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) /white clover (Trifolium repens) pasture, during the pre-mating and mating periods, on gastrointestinal parasitism control and reproductive rates in 7 months old ewe hoggets. A rotational grazing system with 348 Romney weaned hoggels was used. Hoggets were randomly allocated to three treatment groups (116 /group), being: control pasture with regular anthelmintic drenching, control pasture with trigger drenching (drenched only when mean faecal egg count of each group exceeded 1000 eggs/g wet faeces) and willow fodder blocks with trigger drenching. Four replicated pasture areas and five replicated willow fodder blocks were rotationally grazed by single groups of animals, using animals as the replicates for statistical analysis. The fodder blocks contained small trees and a mixture of herbage growing under the trees. After mating, the three groups were joined together and managed as one group {{until the end of}} the experiment at weaning, on 7 January 2007. Hogget live weight (LW), dag scores, faecal egg counts (FEC) and reproductive rate at foetal ultrasound scanning, lambing, docking and weaning were measured. Ewe <b>hogget</b> <b>wool</b> production was measured at weaning. Relative to control pastures, fodder block herbage was of lower dead matter content and its legume content was slightly higher. Total N concentration (35 g/kg dry matter; DM), organic matter digestibility (OMD; 0. 68) and metabolisable energy (ME; 10 MJ/kg DM) were similar for fodder block pasture and control pasture; the selected tree fodder had lower concentrations of N (24 g/kg DM) and was higher in OMD (0. 74) and ME (10. 4 MJ/kg DM). Tree fodder contained higher concentrations of CT (22. 9 g/kg DM) compared to 1. 6 g/kg DM in control pasture and herbage in willow fodder blocks. Grazing willow fodder blocks increased LWG (approximately 97 g/day vs. 86 g/day; P< 0. 0001) and increased reproductive rate corrected to equal LW by approximately 17 % units (P< 0. 05), due to increases in both oestrus activity (P< 0. 01) and conception rates (hoggets pregnant/ 100 hoggets mated; P< 0. 05). Calculated daily DM (1. 41 kg) and ME (14 MJ) intake were similar in all groups. Calculated daily CT intake (6. 0 g vs. 2. 1 g) and CT intake/ 100 g CP intake (2. 2 g vs. 0. 7 g) was higher for willow fodder block hoggets than for the control pasture groups; this may have increased the flow of undegraded dietary protein (UDP) to the small intestine, leading to increases in reproductive rate of this group. Grazing willow fodder blocks failed to reduce the number of anthelmintic drenches (3) needed to maintain FEC below 1000 epg wet faeces, but was successful in reducing dag score relative to grazing conventional ryegrass/white clover pastures. It was concluded that grazing willow fodder blocks can play a beneficial role in sustainable farming systems as it can sustain animal growth rates, increase reproductive rate and reduce dag formation in parasitized hoggets. These benefits were associated with reduced dead matter content and increased legume content in fodder block herbage and with increased intake of secondary compounds from the trees. However, both pasture and trees need to be managed as a tree/pasture system in order to produce herbage of higher nutritive value and more efficiently utilise willow fodder blocks as a supplementary feed. After 6 years of grazing in this manner, the survival rate of the trees was approximately 85...|$|E
6000|$|With {{this came}} up Lenehan to {{the feet of}} the table to say how the letter was in that night's gazette and he made a show to find it about him (for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on Stephen's persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women, {{horseflesh}} or hot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes {{and for the most part}} hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul's men, runners, flatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip. He took his ordinary at a boilingcook's and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue, some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother's son of them would burst their sides. The other, Costello that is, hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was his name), 'tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague. But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their bully beef, a pox on it. There's as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset. Mort aux vaches, says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too. From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes. One time he would be a playactor, then a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire's heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids' linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands across, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter all? I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats, says he. I can scarce believe 'tis so bad, says he. And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy <b>hoggets</b> and wether <b>wool,</b> having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe, a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low's yard in Prussia street. I question with you there, says he. More like 'tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr Stephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor's chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing. He'll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that's Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr Stephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English chinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them all, with an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent cross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper and a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns galore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and rollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains. What for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer's blessing, and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the blessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they dressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart's content. By this time the father of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls' language and they all after him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying: By the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And, says Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he'd run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry's orders. There was bad blood between them at first, says Mr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I'll meddle in his matters, says he. I'll make that animal smell hell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But one evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans, Bos Bovum, which is good bog Latin for boss of the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head into a cow's drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the water running off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls' language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate women were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the yards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind, put her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm, ran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run, pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America. Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty: ...|$|R
