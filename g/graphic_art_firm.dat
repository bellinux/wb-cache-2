50|$|Schunk und Ebe oHG {{was founded}} in 1913 as a factory for {{production}} of carbon brushes for dynamos and electric motors in Fulda in Hesse and moved in 1918 to Heuchelheim near Giessen. By now the company has developed into being the Schunk Group, a technology concern with worldwide operations. Ludwig Schunk's forebears had been settled in the Central Hesse region {{since the middle of}} the 18th century and for several generations had been nail makers in Büdingen. His grandfather had still exercised that craft. Ludwig Schunk's father, as the youngest of three children, saw practically no possibility of ever being able to take over his father's workshop and moved to Frankfurt where, among other things, he worked in a <b>graphic</b> <b>art</b> <b>firm.</b> Ludwig Schunk grew up as the younger of two children in what were modest circumstances. Nonetheless, his family made it possible for him to attend an eight-year secondary school which he successfully completed.|$|E

40|$|Printing and <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> <b>firms</b> {{across the}} United States have been {{experiencing}} {{growth over the}} last 3 years, but their ability to optimize business opportunities in an expanding economy has been restricted by an environment {{where there is a}} shortage of skilled workers to fill the voids left by retirements. Even more challenging is finding the right people that can contribute quickly. Printers are reluctant to hire unskilled workers, as they have adapted advanced technologies that require specific skills and knowledge. The midwest, especially east central and southeast Wisconsin, is a hotbed for printing and <b>graphic</b> <b>arts.</b> <b>Firms</b> in this region are experiencing the same employee shortages and technology upgrades. They have increasingly been relying on Fox Valley Technical College's <b>Graphic</b> <b>Arts</b> Program to supply trained graduates. Unfortunately, FVTC does not have enough students to meet the demand.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to question the validity of community colleges 2 ̆ 7 occupational goals for <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> programs in the United States. To accomplish this, a statistical investigation was designed to either accept or reject the hypothesis of the thesis, which was: If a community college 2 ̆ 7 s educational objective in a <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> program is to prepare the student for a specific occupational area and level of occupation in the <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> industry, then upon successful completion of the program, a personnel director of a <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> <b>firm</b> would hire the student for that area and level of occupation for which he was trained. Approximately 100 community colleges in the United States were contacted. The survey included those schools awarding an Associate of Arts, an Associate of Science, or a diploma/certificate in <b>graphic</b> <b>arts.</b> The directors of the <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> programs were asked about the occupational positions that the school 2 ̆ 7 s curriculum prepared students for after graduation. They were asked to select the positions from a list sent to them. Another question asked of the community college directors concerning graduates of their program was about the positions that the majority of their students had entered upon graduation. The responses were checked on the same list of occupations. These two lists should correlate highly if the occupational goals of the program were accurate in relation to actual conditions and manpower requirements. The school catalogs were also obtained from the directors. The majority of the <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> programs were summarized into three representative programs: one program for the technical aspects of printing, one program for the technical/management aspects, and one representing all the one to one-and-a-half year certificate programs. The occupational goals {{for each of the three}} programs were kept separate. The three programs were shown to a random sampling of printing firms across the country. The personnel directors were asked what occupational positions graduates of the three curricula are qualified to fill. They were then asked to check the occupation from the same list presented to the community college directors. Ideally, the lists from the community college directors and the personnel directors should be the same. If this is true, then the hypothesis is true. If there is a significant difference between the responses, then the hypothesis is false, showing that the goals of community college programs are not realistic and valid. The conclusions of the research were contrary to much of the published information on community college <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> programs. Using Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s Product Moment Correlation Coefficient and a significance level of 0. 05, the hypothesis was accepted. That is, students were in general being hired for those positions professed to be occupational goals of the curricula. This was true for all three representative programs...|$|R
