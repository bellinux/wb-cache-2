5|$|As the Khmer Rouge had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that the Khmer Rouge might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare <b>dispensers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{variants}} of the AW101 {{are equipped with}} self-defence systems, such as chaff and flare <b>dispensers,</b> directed infrared countermeasures (infrared jammers), ESM (electronic support measures {{in the form of}} RF heads), and a laser detection and warning system. British Merlins have been outfitted with protective armour against small-arms fire. A chin-mounted forward looking infrared (FLIR) imaging sensor has been fitted to some variants.|$|E
5|$|The Su-25 {{often has}} radios {{installed}} for air-to-ground and air-to-air communications, including an SO-69 identification-friend-or-foe (IFF) transponder.

Hostile radar uses are guarded against via an SPO-15 radar warning receiver.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} smart {{medication}} <b>dispenser</b> having {{a high degree}} of scalability and remote manageability. We construct the <b>dispenser</b> to have extensible hardware architecture for achieving scalability, and we install an agent program in it for achieving remote manageability. The <b>dispenser</b> operates as follows: when the real-time clock reaches the predetermined medication time and the user presses the dispense button at that time, the predetermined medication is dispensed from the medication dispensing tray (MDT). In the proposed <b>dispenser,</b> the medication for each patient is stored in an MDT. One smart medication <b>dispenser</b> contains mainly one MDT; however, the <b>dispenser</b> can be extended to include more MDTs in order to support multiple users using one <b>dispenser.</b> For remote management, the proposed <b>dispenser</b> transmits the medication status and the system configurations to the monitoring server. In the case of a specific event such as a shortage of medication, memory overload, software error, or non-adherence, the event is transmitted immediately. All these operations are performed automatically without the intervention of patients, through the agent program installed in the <b>dispenser.</b> Results of implementation and verification show that the proposed <b>dispenser</b> operates normally and performs the management operations from the medication monitoring server suitably...|$|R

5|$|By 1975, {{plans were}} laid {{to replace the}} Hunter in the air-to-air role with a more modern fighter aircraft, the Northrop F-5E Tiger II. The Hunter {{remained}} in a key role within the Swiss Air Force; like the RAF's Hunter fleet, the type transitioned to become the country's primary ground attack platform, replacing the Venom. While the Swiss Hunters already had more armament options than the RAF aircraft, being cleared to carry Oerlikon 80mm rockets instead of the elderly 3-inch rockets used by the RAF, to carry bombs from both inner and outer pylons and to launch AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, the change to a primary air-to-ground role resulted in the Hunter 80 upgrade, adding chaff/flare <b>dispensers,</b> BL755 cluster bombs {{and the ability to}} carry AGM-65 Maverick missiles.|$|E
5|$|Fielded in 1991, the Night Attack Harrier was {{the first}} upgrade of the AV-8B. It {{differed}} from the original aircraft in having a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera added {{to the top of}} the nose cone, a wide Smiths Industries head-up display (HUD), provisions for night vision goggles, and a Honeywell digital moving map system. The FLIR uses thermal imaging to identify objects by their heat signatures. The variant was powered by the F402-RR-408 engine, which featured an electronic control system and was more powerful and reliable. The flare and chaff <b>dispensers</b> were moved, and the ram air intake was lengthened at the fin's base. Initially known as the AV-8D, the night-attack variant was designated the AV-8B(NA).|$|E

40|$|Soap <b>Dispenser</b> is a {{personal}} care product which includes liquid soap and <b>dispenser.</b> This product generally use to washing a hand where {{can be found at}} the most toilet or restaurant. There has a lot of soap <b>dispenser</b> design and shape can be found in the market. The functions of the entire soap <b>dispenser</b> are almost same which is to dispense a liquid soap. The main objective of the project was to design and develop a multipurpose soap <b>dispenser</b> prototype. An additional function may be adapted to the current soap <b>dispenser</b> to enhance the ability of the soap <b>dispenser</b> in order to meet the current demand. The process of development may be conducted based on several tools of idea and concept generation such as New Product Development (NPD) and Design for Manufacturing (DFM). The development was focused on the additional functions and performance of the product. Another wish was to increase consistency and reliability of the prototyped product. An initial pre-study gave insight in how to come out with multipurpose functions that can be adapted into the soap <b>dispenser.</b> A wide variety of soap <b>dispenser</b> and the other hygiene care product were studied to obtain complete understanding. Next phase was to generate ideas and new concepts which after the product and concept evaluation resulted from the analysis. These concepts were made as functional mock-ups for further testing and evaluation and finally built as a fully prototype. A new multipurpose soap <b>dispenser</b> prototype finally produced by using Fortus 360 mc prototype machine.

5|$|The Temple is {{surrounded}} by sites where villagers worship, generating the power needed to cast miracles. Villagers require feeding, healing or rest to worship. How many villagers worship is controlled at the Village Centre, and which miracles are available depends on those available at the player's villages. Miracles include providing food or wood, healing people, and providing shields to protect an area. Miracles can also be cast by using Miracle <b>Dispensers,</b> a common reward for completing Silver Reward Scrolls. These allow the casting of a miracle without worship. Miracles can only be cast, and most other actions performed, within the player's area of influence, which can be extended by expanding the population of villages owned, or by taking over others. Miracles can be selected at the Temple or Village Centre, or by performing certain gestures with the Hand. Power can also be produced by sacrificing living beings at the altar.|$|E

5|$|To be {{considered}} a dictator novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical examination of the power held by the dictator, the caudillo, and some general reflection {{on the nature of}} authoritarianism. Although some dictator novels centre on one historical dictator (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the régime as might a history book. The dictator novel genre includes I, the Supreme (1974), by Augusto Roa Bastos, about Dr. Francia of Paraguay, and The Feast of the Goat (2000), by Mario Vargas Llosa, about Rafael Leónidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional dictator to achieve the same narrative end, as in Reasons of State (1974), by Alejo Carpentier, in which the dictator is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of the dictator novel has been very influential {{in the development of a}} Latin American literary tradition, because many of the novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own social roles as paternalistic <b>dispensers</b> of wisdom, like that of the caudillo whose régime they challenged in their dictator novels.|$|E
