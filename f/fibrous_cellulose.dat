40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of calcium, alginate, <b>fibrous</b> <b>cellulose,</b> and pH on the {{flocculation}} dynamics and final properties of synthetic activated sludges. A laboratory-scale batch reactor, fed with standard synthetic sludges was used. The effects of varying calcium concentration (5 - 25 mM), alginate concentration (25 - 125 mg/L), <b>fibrous</b> <b>cellulose</b> concentration (0. 2 - 0. 8 g/L) and pH (3 - 9) on the sludge characteristics were studied by varying one parameter whilst keeping the others constant. The results from experiments indicated that the calcium, alginate, <b>fibrous</b> <b>cellulose,</b> and pH had the critical effect on the aggregation rate, flocs size, and made {{the improvement of the}} final properties of sludge. Dynamic measurements have established the optimum conditions for floc formation and can accurately reflect the state of formation of the synthetic activated sludge flocs. These correlate well with measurements of settleability and turbidity of the synthetic activated sludge. The results of this study support the bonding theory and indicate that formation of cations-polymer complexes and polymer gelation are important means of flocculation. The development of synthetic activated sludges is suggested also to be a possible surrogate for studying the final properties of activated sludge...|$|E

The objective of this work is to develop a methodology for the enzymatic acylation {{of cellulose}} with long chain fatty groups in one step. Therefore we designed a system at which <b>fibrous</b> <b>cellulose</b> was enzymatically acylated with vinyl laurate in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) and as a result cellulose laurate was formed. The biocatalysts used for this reaction were immobilized lipase Candida antarctica, immobilized esterase from hog liver and the immobilized cutinase Fusarium solani. The ester content of the product varied on the specificity of the biocatalyst used, reaching a maximum of 4. 1 % after 9 h of reaction.

40|$|On one {{sample of}} 'standard cellulose' the isotherms for the {{sorption}} of water vapor at different relative vapor pressures, {{have been established}} at 20 degree intervals from 0 °C to 80 °C. These have been determined for both adsorption and desorption. These isotherms have the regular sigmoidal shape and hysteresis is exhibited between the adsorption and desorption curves. It is shown that as the temperature is raised the sorptive power of cellulose toward water decreases and also that the hysteresis decreases, i. e., the desorption and adsorption curves approach one another. The Olausius-Clapeyron relationship bas been applied to these and to "equilibrium" isotherms derived from them to determine the differential heats of wetting of "standard cellulose" at different moisture contents.

40|$|AbstractThis work is {{concerned}} with the dissolution of cellulose in tetraallylammonium fluoride/DMSO; the thermal stability of electrolyte solution, and relevant mechanistic aspects of the biopolymer acylation. EMF measurements (fluoride ion-selective electrode) showed that the electrolyte is present as monohydrate. 1 H NMR spectroscopy showed that it does not undergo elimination via ylide intermediate, even after heating for 21 h at 70 °C. A solution of TAAF in DMSO readily dissolves microcrystalline and <b>fibrous</b> <b>celluloses</b> (cotton and eucalyptus); the dissolved biopolymer can be derivatized into esters by reaction with carboxylic acid anhydrides. Cellulose ethanoate, butanoate, hexanoate, and mixed esters, ethanoate/butanoate, ethanoate/hexanoate were conveniently synthesized under homogeneous reaction conditions (3 h at 60, 80, and 100 °C). Using longer reaction times (12, 18 h) lead to esters of low degree of substitution, due to fluoride-ion mediated ester-hydrolysis. The intermediate formation of acyl fluorides in this medium has been confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of proteins}} on particulate and <b>fibrous</b> <b>celluloses</b> was studied {{by means of}} X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The presence of protein (bovine serum albumin and Celluclast, a commercial cellulase from Trichoderma reesei) adsorbed on the fibres was detected by N 1 s signal in the wide-field spectrum. The proteins adsorbed onto several types of cellulose could be compared, irrespective of the fibres' specific surface area. The fractional monolayer coverage of cellulose fibres could also be calculated. The influence of surfactant Tween 85 on cellulase adsorption and enzymatic activity was also investigated. At low enzyme concentrations, the surfactant reduces the amount of adsorbed enzyme, simoultaneously improving the reaction rate. The effect of the surfactant depends on the structural properties of the substrate. The higher the crystallinity of the substrate, the less effective is the enhancement of the reaction and {{the reduction of the}} amount of the adsorbed enzyme by the surfactant...|$|R

40|$|Cellulose-binding protein A (CbpA), a {{component}} of the cellulase complex of Clostridium cellulovorans, contains a unique sequence which has been demonstrated to be a cellulose-binding domain (CBD). The DNA coding for this putative CBD was subcloned into pET- 8 c, an Escherichia coli expression vector. The protein produced {{under the direction of the}} recombinant plasmid, pET-CBD, had a high affinity for crystalline cellulose. Affinity-purified CBD protein was used in equilibrium binding experiments to characterize the interaction of the protein with various polysaccharides. It was found that the binding capacity of highly crystalline cellulose samples (e. g., cotton) was greater than that of samples of low crystallinity (e. g., <b>fibrous</b> <b>cellulose).</b> At saturating CBD concentration, about 6. 4 mumol of protein was bound by 1 g of cotton. Under the same conditions, <b>fibrous</b> <b>cellulose</b> bound only 0. 2 mumol of CBD per g. The measured dissociation constant was in the 1 microM range for all cellulose samples. The results suggest that the CBD binds specifically to crystalline cellulose. Chitin, which has a crystal structure similar to that of cellulose, also was bound by the CBD. The presence of high levels of cellobiose or carboxymethyl cellulose in the assay mixture had no effect on the binding of CBD protein to crystalline cellulose. This result suggests that the CBD recognition site is larger than a simple cellobiose unit or more complex than a repeating cellobiose moiety. This CBD is of particular interest because it is the first CBD from a completely sequenced nonenzymatic protein shown to be an independently functional domain...|$|E

Morphological analysis of the treated paper was performed by means of scanning electron microscopy while the effect of modified HNTs on the thermal behaviour of the cellulose fibres was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry which determined the combustion enthalpy of the paper. Water contact angle measurements were performed to study the paper wettability. The physico-chemical properties investigated (mesoscopic structure, thermal stability and wettability) of the treated paper were correlated successfully with the consolidation loading and, consequently, to the affinity between the fluorinated modified HNTs and the <b>fibrous</b> <b>cellulose</b> structure.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to show the increasing importance of the chemical modification, by grafting, of cellulose {{in order to get}} a cellulose material with improved absorption and retention. Acrylic monomers, i. e. acrylic acid and acrylonitrile, were grafted onto cellulose fibres by using a free radical process initiated by two types of redox initiators: persulfate radicals (potassium persulfate, KPS) and ceric ions (ceric ammonium nitrate, CAN). The <b>fibrous</b> <b>celluloses</b> used were: a treated Kraft fluff pulp, rayon fibres (regenerated cellulose) and short cotton fibres (mill waste). Major factors affecting graft co-polymerization onto cellulose (surface morphology of cellulose, initiation process, reaction temperature and hydrolysis of grafted samples) were studied. The grafting has been confirmed by infrared analysis through the apparition of new characteristic lines of monomers on the spectra of grafted samples. The maximum grafting yield was obtained at room temperature by using a CAN initiation technique. Retention values and grafting yield were determined: due to counter ion effect, the retention of a 0. 9 % NaCl solution was about 70 % of the water retention value. The swelling of grafted samples is significantly higher than that observed for the native cellulose. The acrylic functions grafted onto cellulose improved the liquid retention of sample...|$|R

The cellulose samples employed included microcrystalline, MCC; mercerized cotton linters, M-cotton, and mercerized sisal, M-sisal. The reaction efficiency expresses {{the relationship between the}} degree of substitution, DS, of the ester obtained, and the molar ratio Ac(2) O/AGU (anhydroglucose unit of the biopolymer); 100 % efficiency means obtaining DS = 3 at Ac(2) O/AGU = 3. For all celluloses, the dependence of DS on Ac(2) O/AGU is described by an exponential decay equation: DS = DS(o) - Ae(-[(Ac 2 O/AGU) /B]); (A) and (B) are regression coefficients, and DS(o) is the calculated maximum degree of substitution, achieved under the conditions of each experiment. Values of (B) are clearly dependent on the cellulose employed: B((M-cotton)) > B((M-sisal)) > B((MCC)); they correlate qualitatively with the degree of polymerization of cellulose, and linearly with the aggregation number, N(agg), of the dissolved biopolymer, as calculated from static light scattering measurements: (B) = 1. 709 + 0. 034 N(agg). To our knowledge, this is the first report on the latter correlation; it shows the importance of the physical state of dissolved cellulose, and serves to explain, in part, the need to use distinct reaction conditions for MCC and <b>fibrous</b> <b>celluloses,</b> in particular Ac(2) O/AGU, time, temperature.

Up to 5 – 7 wt % <b>fibrous</b> <b>cellulose</b> can be dissolved in 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bromide ([C 4 mim][Br]) and 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium thiocyanate ([C 4 mim][SCN]) by microwave heating for 3 – 5  s, but cannot be dissolved at all in 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C 4 mim][BF 4]) and 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([C 4 mim][PF 6]) [6]. Sun et al. [11] revealed that acetate-based ionic liquids are superior to chloride-based ones for dissolving cellulose. The solubilization of cellulose in ionic liquids is mainly caused by the hydrogen bonding of cellulose hydroxyl groups to chloride or acetate anions and imidazolium cations [13 – 15]. Ohno et al. [16] reported that an ionic liquid, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([C 2 mim][Cl]), not only dissolved and decomposed cellulose, but also reacted with the compounds produced by the decomposition to form new polymers.|$|E

40|$|During {{cellular}} morphogenesis, {{changes in}} cell shape and cell junction topology are fundamental to normal tissue and organ development. Here {{we show that}} apoplastic Glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored Lipid Transfer Protein (LTPG) is excluded from cell junctions and flat wall regions, and passively accumulates around their borders in the epidermal cells of Arabidopsis thaliana. Beginning with intense accumulation beneath highly curved cell junction borders, this enrichment is gradually lost as cells become more bulbous during their differentiation. In fully mature epidermal cells, YFP-LTPG often shows a <b>fibrous</b> <b>cellulose</b> microfibril-like pattern within the bulging outer faces. Physical contact between a flat glass surface and bulbous cell surface induces rapid and reversible evacuation from contact sites and accumulation to the curved wall regions surrounding the contact borders. Thus, LTPG distribution is dynamic, responding to changes in cell shape and wall curvature during cell growth and differentiation. We hypothesize that this geometry-based mechanism guides wax-carrying LTPG to functional sites, where it may act to "seal" the vulnerable border surrounding cell-cell junctions and assist in cell wall fortification and cuticular wax deposition...|$|E

When deionized water was used at pH 4 – 5, water-soluble cationic aluminum species (Al 3 +, aluminum oligomer, and polyaluminum species) were adsorbed on the solid FCMC, forming carboxylic acid aluminum salts by cation exchange. The formation of these nondissociated pulp-COOAl type structures in paper sheets {{may contribute to}} some decreases in hydrophilic property. On the other hand, the water-soluble cationic aluminum species had nearly no interactions with hydroxyl groups of solid cellulose in the suspensions at pH 4 – 5. When tap water was used at pH 5 – 7, some aluminum components were retained on not only FCMC but also the FC sample. Probably, water-insoluble Al(OH) 3 flocs are formed in the suspensions at pH 5 – 7 and retained on the FC sample by simple filtration effect. Therefore, two mechanisms of the aluminum retention (i.e., electrostatic interactions and a simple filtration effect) may exist between pulp fibers and aluminum components in the practical papermaking process.|$|E

The first two characteristics can be rather easily satisfied by choosing an appropriate starting material for the fabrication of the scaffold (e. g. a natural polymer), so the main subject of the present thesis is focused on the production of porous structures out of biodegradable-biocompatible polymers. Initially, <b>fibrous</b> <b>cellulose</b> acetate and poly(hydroxyl butyrate) (PHB) structures were successfully prepared via the electrospinning technique. The structures exhibited an average diameter size between 0. 6 and 3 μm. In the fibrous scaffolds of PHB piroxicam was encapsulated while amoxicillin was loaded in the cellulose acetate scaffolds. In both cases the loading percentage was low. It was found that increase of the drug concentration in the initial solution does not lead to an increase in the loading percentage. Next, the particulate leaching method was used in order to produce porous chitin and chitin-hydroxyapatite structures. According to the literature, salt (water soluble) particles were used. It was found that this method cannot be applied successfully in hydrophilic polymers like chitin due to the simultaneous removal of the polymer solvent and the porogen particles. Thus, next water insoluble particulates were used. This approach was successfully applied to chitin, cellulose, chitosan and composite materials of chitin-hydroxyapatite, cellulose-hydroxyapatite and chitosan-gelatin. The produced structures exhibited great uniformity, high and open porosity. The use of ionic liquids as solvents, in the case of cellulose, enables the process and the production of composite materials. By the in situ fabrication of scaffolds with the above mentioned method in porcelain samples, connection of chitin, chitosan and chitosan-gelatin scaffolds with porcelain was achieved. The connection was by infrared spectroscopy and it was found that mainly responsible for this, is the interaction via dispersion forces between groups of the polymers and the porcelain sample. The ceramic connected with polymer scaffolds is a composite biomaterial. Other composite biomaterials that consist of two or three scaffolds were fabricated by combining different techniques. The connection between the scaffolds was achieved due to dispersion forces or hydrogen bonds. Such a material could possibly find application in multiple tissue or tissue interface regeneration. By using supercritical CO 2 porous poly(methyl methacrylate) structures were produced via the polymer foaming (temperature induced) method. The influence of the polymer thickness was examined. In all cases sub-micron porous were obtained and it was found that by increasing thickness the average pore diameter and the dispersion increase. For qualitative theoretical explanation of the results the activation energy of homogeneous nucleation was determined by taking into account the kinetics of heat and mass transfer in these samples. For the production of porous structures, by using CO 2, in crystalline polymers such as chitin and cellulose a novel method, that was developed during the thesis, was applied: the hydrogel foaming. Porous chitin, cellulose, cellulose-hydroxyapatite and cellulose-silicon oxide structures were produced with an average diameter between 30 and 150 μm. It was found that by increasing pressure or decreasing temperature, average pore diameter decreases. The incomplete desorption of CO 2 from the hydrogel in some cases (that arises from cooling due to the Joule-Thomson effect) leads to an increased pore interconnection. If instead of hydrogels alco-gels are used it was found that via the critical point drying technique (and by using supercritical CO 2) nanoporous chitin and cellulose aerogels can be prepared. The influence of different parameters on the characteristics of the final material was examined. Also the feasibility of producing carbon aerogel with chitin aerogel as precursor was examined. The foaming of alco-gels was found to be defective. This was attributed to the crystallinity of the gels. Hydrogels can be considered as amorphous polymer in the rubbery state (flexible chains), where the CO 2 desorption leads to pore formation. In contrast, in the case of alco-gels the production of porous structure depends exclusively on the interaction of CO 2 with the solvent of the gel. The sorpion of CO 2 by chitin and cellulose hydrogels was measured by a modified mass loss analysis. Also an apparatus was designed and constructed that combines volumetric method and Calvet calorimetry. [...] ...|$|E
50|$|In the hot season, solar {{radiation}} predominates {{as the source}} of heat gain. Radiative heat transfer is related to the fourth power of the absolute temperature (measured in degrees Kelvin = degrees Celsius + 273.16; Stefan-Boltzmann law). Therefore, such transfer is at its most significant when the objective is to cool (i.e. when {{solar radiation}} has produced very warm surfaces). On the other hand, the conductive and convective heat loss modes play a more significant role during the cooler months. At such lower ambient temperatures the traditional <b>fibrous,</b> plastic and <b>cellulose</b> insulations play by far the major role: the radiative heat transfer component is of far less importance and the main contribution of the radiation barrier is in its superior air-tightness contribution.In summary: claims for radiant barrier insulation are justifiable at high temperatures, typically when minimizing summer heat transfer; but these claims are not justifiable in traditional winter (keeping-warm) conditions.|$|R
40|$|Hydrolysis {{of organic}} {{particulates}} under anaerobic conditions is {{generally regarded as}} the rate limiting step in solid digestion processes. Rumen-based ecosystems appear to achieve very high hydrolysis rates for cellulosic organic material. This study aimed at the development and demonstration of an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR) process operating with a rumen-based microbial inoculum. <b>Fibrous</b> alpha <b>cellulose</b> was used as sole carbon substrate {{and the use of}} an SBR operating cycle allowed the utilisation of a high liquid flow rate (hydraulic retention time of 0. 67 d) while maintaining a much longer solids retention time of 7 d. Complete mass balances for carbon and nitrogen, as well as GOD balancing allowed the full characterisation of the process stoichiometry and kinetics. Elemental analysis of the biomass revealed a composition of C 5 H 4. 8 O 2. 4 N 0. 7, which is quite different from other generic biomass compositions used in the literature. The anaerobic rumen SBR was compared with another rumen-based reactor system in the literature which used a continuous filtration process for solid/liquid separation. This comparison showed that the volatile fatty acid production rate from cellulose in the anaerobic SBR was comparable with the performance achieved in the,continuous system, although loading, substrate type and media composition were quite different between these two studies. Further evaluation of the anaerobic rumen SBR is required to determine its practical application for other substrates and to demonstrate the scale-up potential of this concept...|$|R
40|$|The Sugar {{industry}} {{has played a}} significant role in producing agriculture-based revenue for the Australian economy. However, intense competition from several countries has resulted in reduced sugar profitability. The current economic condition of the Australian sugar industry may be improved by the utilisation of its by-products. One of the main by-products of raw sugar production is bagasse. Bagasse is the <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibrous</b> matter remaining after the extraction of juice from the cane stalk. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of bagasse as a thermal insulator. This is achieved by measuring the thermal conductivity of bagasse using a guarded-hot-plate apparatus, across ranges of mean fibre size and material density. An error analysis was also carried out to determine the confidence level of the experimental data obtained. Results from the investigation show that the thermal conductivity of unprocessed bagasse falls within the range of values normally associated with thermal insulation materials. Hence, with further treatment for fire retarding and density reduction, bagasse has potential as an insulation material...|$|R
40|$|Injury to bone {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} and costly medical conditions. Clinical treatment of volumetric bone loss or hard-to-heal bony lesions often requires the use of proper bone grafting materials, with or without adjuvant anabolic therapeutics. Despite significant problems associated with autografting (donor site morbidity, limited supplies) and allografting (disease transmissions, high graft failure rates) procedures, synthetic bone grafts remain the least utilized clinically. Existing synthetic orthopaedic biomaterials rarely possess a combination of bone-like structural and biochemical properties required for robust osteointegration, scalable and user-friendly characteristics indispensable for successful clinical translations. This thesis tests the hypothesis that by recapitulating key structural elements and biochemical components of bone in 3 - and 2 -dimensional biomaterials, scalable synthetic bone grafts can be designed to enable expedited healing of hard-to-heal volumetric bone loss. Specifically, FlexBone, a 3 -dimensional hydrogel scaffold encapsulating 50 wt% of structurally well integrated nanocrylstalline hydroxyapatite, the main inorganic component of bone, was developed. The large surface area of nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite combined with its intrinsic affinity to proteins and its excellent structural integration with the hydrogel matrix enabled FlexBone to both sequester endogenous protein signals upon press-fitting into an area of skeletal defect and to deliver exogenous protein therapeutics in a localized and sustained manner. We demonstrated that FlexBone enabled the functional healing of critical-size long bone defects in rats in 8 – 12 weeks with the addition of a very low dose of osteogenic growth factor BMP- 2 / 7. This promising synthetic bone graft is now being explored for the delivery of multiple growth factors to expedite the healing of diabetic bony lesions. In addition, a 2 -dimensional electrospun <b>cellulose</b> <b>fibrous</b> mesh was chemically modified with sulfate residues to mimic sulfated polysaccharide ECM components of skeletal tissues to enabled progenitor cell attachment and differentiation as well as controlled retention and localized/sustained delivery of protein therapeutics. This sulfated fibrous mesh is currently explored as synthetic periosteum to augment the osteointegration of devitalized structural allografts. Finally, a rat subcutaneous implantation model developed to examine the biocompatibility of newly developed biodegradable shape memory polymer bone substitutes is also presented...|$|R
