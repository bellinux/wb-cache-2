Thus, integrating multiple channels with <b>directional</b> <b>antennas</b> can bring numerous benefits. Furthermore, we also explore some techniques in the MAC layer design with <b>directional</b> <b>antennas.</b> Some useful insights are also given. The capacity of wireless networks are mainly affected by two key factors: the interference among concurrent transmissions and the number of simultaneous transmissions on a single interface. Recent studies have found that, using multiple channels can separate concurrent transmissions and significantly improve network throughput. However, those studies only consider wireless nodes that are only equipped with omni-directional antennas, which cause high collisions. On the other hand, some researchers have found that <b>directional</b> <b>antennas</b> bring more benefits such as the reduced interference and the increased spatial reuse compared with omni-directional antennas. But, they only focused on a single-channel network which only allows finite concurrent transmissions. In this thesis, we propose a novel network architecture, in terms of multi-channel networks using multiple <b>directional</b> <b>antennas</b> (MC-MDA), which integrates the two technologies of multiple channels and <b>directional</b> <b>antennas</b> together and potentially brings more benefits. We study the capacity of MC-MDA networks and explore the benefits of such networks. We have found that using <b>directional</b> <b>antennas</b> in multi-channel networks can greatly increase the network capacity. Furthermore, such networks require fewer channels than multi-channels with omni-directional antennas. More specifically, we study the channel assignment problem of such MC-MDA networks. Our results indicate that using <b>directional</b> <b>antennas</b> in wireless networks can significantly reduce the required number of channels. <b>Directional</b> <b>antennas</b> have a better spectrum reuse than omni-directional antennas.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Directional</b> <b>antennas</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to significantly improve the throughput of a wireless ad hoc network. At the same time, energy consumption can be considerably reduced if the network implements per-packet transmission power control. Typical MAC protocols for ad hoc networks (e. g., the IEEE 802. 11 Ad Hoc mode) were designed for wireless devices with omnidirectional antennas. When used with <b>directional</b> <b>antennas,</b> such protocols suffer from several medium access problems, including interference from minor lobes and hidden-terminal problems, which prevent full exploitation of the potential of <b>directional</b> <b>antennas.</b> In this paper, we propose a power-controlled MAC protocol for <b>directional</b> <b>antennas</b> that ameliorates these problems. Our protocol allows for dynamic adjustment of the transmission power for both data and clear-to-send (CTS) packets to optimize energy consumption. It provides a mechanism for permitting interference-limited concurrent transmissions and choosing the appropriate tradeoff between throughput and energy consumption. The protocol enables nodes to implement load control in a distributed manner, whereby the total interference in the neighborhood of a receiver is upper-bounded. Simulation results demonstrate that the combined gain from concurrent transmissions using <b>directional</b> <b>antennas</b> and power control results in significant improvement in network throughput and considerable reduction in energy consumption.
