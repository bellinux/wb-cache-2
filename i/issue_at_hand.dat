5|$|There is some {{authority}} {{to the effect that}} a court will not generally grant a declaration if it considers the <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> to be an academic question or one that is entirely hypothetical. For instance, in Vince v. Chief Constable of Dorset Police (1992), proceedings against the Chief Constable of Dorset Police were brought by the plaintiffs on behalf of members of the Police Federation of England and Wales to, among other things, enable chief constables throughout the country to know where they stood on a question of law with respect to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, namely, whether it was unlawful to appoint an acting sergeant as a custody officer under section 36(3) of the Act. Affirming the decision of the judge below, a majority of the Court of Appeal declined to make a declaration on the matter. It took the view that since {{there was no evidence that}} any chief constable had ever appointed an acting sergeant as a custody officer, the issue was academic or hypothetical.|$|E

25|$|Despite state {{prohibitions}} against {{torture and}} custodial misconduct by the police, torture is widespread in police custody, {{which is a}} major reason behind deaths in custody. The police often torture innocent people until a 'confession' is obtained to save influential and wealthy offenders. G.P.

25|$|In {{the course}} of his {{research}} he travelled over Finland and the greater part of his own country; and from 1828 to 1830 he undertook, in company with Georg Adolf Erman and with the co-operation of Russia, a government-funded mission to Western Siberia. A narrative of the expedition soon appeared (Reise-Erinnerungen aus Siberien, 1854; Souvenirs d’un voyage en Sibérie, 1857); but the chief work was not issued until 1863 (Resultate magnetischer Beobachtungen). He did not conclude on the <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> but his work was later completed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. Shortly after the return of the mission, in 1833 Hansteen moved with his family into the observatory, which was created from drawings by the architect Christian Heinrich Grosch.

25|$|After the affair, it came {{to light}} that Greenpeace had miscalculated the amount of toxic waste present aboard the Brent Spar. Greenpeace {{admitted}} that its claims that the Spar contained 5000 tons of oil were inaccurate, apologizing to Shell on September 5. However, Greenpeace dismissed {{the importance of the}} amount of oil on board, pointing to wider industrial responsibility as the main <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> as the Brent Spar was to be the first offshore installation to be dumped in the northeast Atlantic ocean; Greenpeace claimed that it would likely have been followed by the scuttling of dozens or hundreds more platforms, setting what they consider to be a dangerous precedent. The organization went on to point out that Shell's decision to scrap the platform had been taken before Greenpeace announced the existence of an incorrect amount of toxic waste, and that their mistake therefore did not influence Shell's decision.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{was also}} {{referred}} to the House of Lords case of R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Fire Brigades Union (1995). Their Lordships held that the Home Secretary only had a duty to keep {{the implementation of a}} statutory scheme under active consideration until and unless Parliament decided to repeal the statute. The Singapore Court of Appeal distinguished ex parte Fire Brigades Union from the <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> on two grounds. First, the word shall in Article 49(1) indicated that the Prime Minister is under a duty to call an election to fill the vacancy, as opposed to the word may which appeared in the statute in ex parte Fire Brigades Union. Secondly, the Prime Minister's discretion under Article 49(1) is not solely and largely dictated by policy considerations, unlike the Home Secretary's discretion in ex parte Fire Brigades Union. Rather, in deciding when to call a by-election, the Prime Minister must bear in mind the equally important consideration of the interests {{of the people of the}} constituency in which a vacancy has arisen.|$|E

25|$|On 16 October 1841, the Hacham {{issued an}} {{announcement}} {{that the new}} prayerbook did not fulfill the minimal requirements under religious law, and those who used it were not meeting the obligation of worship. The Temple directorate were quick to counter Bernays. Emulating the Orthodox in 1819, they shortly marshaled twelve responsa from liberal rabbis and preachers that, while not all in favour of the volume, lambasted Bernays for placing a ban and refuting his halakhic arguments. The lettres were published in a collection named Theologische Gutachten iiber das Gebetbuch nach dem Gebrauche des neuen israelitischen Tempelvereins in Hamburg. The issue entangled all shades of the rabbinate in Central Europe, engendering a heated polemic: Abraham Geiger, who wrote a lettre {{in support of the}} Hamburg congregation, stressed in his writing that more than the specific <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> he became involved because the controversy surfaced the deepest religious debates of its era. Gotthold Salomon published another tract of his own, where he rebutted most of the rabbi's claims on legal grounds, but acknowledged that the meddling with the Messianic ideal constituted a severe aberration.|$|E
500|$|One of the Parliament's {{justifications}} for restricting judicial review {{in response to}} Chng Suan Tze was that national security is [...] "not a judicial decision" [...] and is not capable of [...] "objective evaluation by the courts". Commentators have noted, though, {{that the role of}} the court as enunciated in Chng Suan Tze is merely to be convinced that there is a national security <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> not to inquire into the executive action required to preserve it. In fact, the court applied the doctrine of justiciability which recognizes that the limits of judicial review in politically sensitive issues is better left to the discretion of the executive.|$|E

By then the Jewish Journal reported that [...] "more than $2 million worth of events have been canceled at the Beverly Hills Hotel by dozens of groups." [...] Dorchester Collection Chief Executive Officer Christopher Cowdray then responded to the controversy by asking the public to consider the <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> in a broader perspective, citing the fact that many brands are backed by foreign investors. Sharia law exists alongside other normative systems and has been adopted by many other Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia which has major investments in the American hospitality industry, including the Four Seasons and Fairmont hotel chains. Adweek declared that [...] "the bad press and protests have tarnished the glamorous image of the Beverly Hills Hotel, {{one of the most famous}} hotels in the world" [...] and added that [...] "such extreme brand damage will be difficult to repair".|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of May 26, the Erie Railroad sent a {{statement}} out from Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey to disregard the order from the previous day. The new sign came down instantly and the conductors continued to call the station Turner once again. Old time locals felt the name Turner had more value to them and shouldn't be touched. A self-appointed committee run by the priest proposed a meeting on Saturday, June 4, 1910 at nearby Gillette Hall to protest the name change. The priest also offered that if the name was to remain Turner's, he would contribute $500 towards {{the construction of a}} new station. The post office also said they would remain named Turner even if the signage on the Erie Railroad station went back to the Harriman name. Sometime during the night between June 1 and June 2, the Erie Railroad took the station depot sign for Turner down once again and re-attached the Harriman sign to the station depot. Local resolutions were sent to the Erie showing citizens' displeasure at changing the signage once again. The order from the Erie stated that beginning on July 15, the station name would remain [...] "Harriman" [...] permanently. Father McAran returned to his outrage and continued to go to the press and give interviews on the <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> To wrap the issue up, a sign in the front of the local church proclaiming [...] "LONG LIVE TURNER" [...] was destroyed. This hurt the enthusiasm of locals, who suggested renaming the local Arden station near the Harriman estate instead.|$|E
