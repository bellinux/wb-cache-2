25|$|In an inquisitorial {{system of}} law, the <b>examining</b> <b>magistrate</b> (also called {{investigating}} magistrate, inquisitorial magistrate, or investigating judge), is {{a judge who}} carries out pre-trial investigations into allegations of crime {{and in some cases}} makes a recommendation for prosecution. The exact role and standing of examining magistrates varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; common duties and powers of the <b>examining</b> <b>magistrate</b> include overseeing ongoing criminal investigations, issuing search warrants, authorizing wiretaps, making decisions on pretrial detention, interrogating the accused person, questioning witnesses, examining evidence, and compiling a dossier of evidence in preparation for trial. Examining magistrates have {{an important role in the}} French judiciary, and are also a feature of the Spanish, Dutch, Belgian and Greek criminal justice systems, although the extent of the examining magistrate's role has generally diminished over time. Several countries, including Switzerland, Germany, Portugal, and Italy, have abolished the position of <b>examining</b> <b>magistrate</b> outright.|$|E

25|$|Before {{an accused}} person is {{committed}} to trial in the High Court, a committal hearing must be held before an <b>examining</b> <b>magistrate</b> {{to determine if there}} is sufficient evidence for the accused to be put on trial. An accused may be committed for trial at once if he or she wishes to plead guilty (except to an offence punishable by death), {{the facts of the case}} presented by the prosecution disclose sufficient grounds for committing the accused, and the magistrate is satisfied that the accused understands the nature of the charge against him or her and intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him or her.|$|E
25|$|The <b>examining</b> <b>magistrate</b> then {{presents}} the dossier detailing {{his or her}} findings {{to the president of}} the bench that will adjudicate on the case where it has been decided that a trial shall be conducted. Therefore, the president of the bench's view of the case is not neutral and may be biased while conducting the trial after the reading of the dossier. Unlike the common law proceedings, the president of the bench in the inquisitorial system is not merely an umpire and is entitled to directly interview the witnesses or express comments during the trial, as long as he or she does not express his or her view on the guilt of the accused.|$|E
2500|$|In the Netherlands, the {{position}} of <b>examining</b> <b>magistrate</b> has existed since 1926, and {{the powers of the}} office were strengthened in 1999.

2500|$|In Latin America, {{the investigative}} ( [...] or [...] ) {{phase of a}} {{criminal}} prosecution was historically overseen by an <b>examining</b> <b>magistrate,</b> preceding the trial (...) phase.

2500|$|Italy {{abolished}} the <b>examining</b> <b>magistrate</b> in 1989, {{as part of}} a broader overhaul of the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure. The reform transferred the investigative functions of the <b>examining</b> <b>magistrate</b> to public prosecutors, who in Italy are also considered judges. The reform transferred the oversight functions of examining magistrates to newly created judges of the preliminary investigation with specified duties, including the issuance of search warrants, the authorization of wiretaps, and the decision on pretrial detention. The replacement of examining magistrates was not the only element of the 1989 reform that [...] "marked a departure from the inquisitorial French tradition and partly subscribed to adversarial assumptions"; the code revision introduced cross-examination and negotiation between the parties, although it preserved some elements of the continental legal tradition.|$|E

50|$|The {{story of}} 19th-century Moguer is {{essentially}} that of 19th-century Spain. At {{the beginning of}} the century, Moguer was the most populous centre in its part of Spain (7,200 inhabitants) followed by Huelva. The French invasion during the Peninsular War left a general sense of provisionality and bewilderment. Briefly in the 1822 territorial division of Spain and then permanently in the 1833 division, a province was established with Huelva as its capital, despite a long and bitter verbal struggle to make Moguer the capital of the new politico-administrative unit. Moguer remained, however, as head of a new legal district (partido judicial) and notarial and registrational districts (distritos notorial y registral) having also comarcal courts, a court of first instance and an <b>examining</b> <b>magistrates</b> court (Juzgados comarcal, de Instancia y de Instrucción). Ecclesiastically, Moguer had been the seat of the vicarage of the same name since the mid-15th century and also core of an archpriesthood (arciprestazgo) whose area was broader than the old vicarage, which only extended as far as Palos de la Frontera.|$|R
50|$|The {{entitlements}} of the Security Service were {{expanded in}} 2006. Before, {{they did not}} have much police power, and were only able to gather and analyse information. The agency was allowed to surveil people, but not to interfere. This has changed now with what are called the Special Inquiry Methods (Bijzondere Inlichtingenmethodes). Federal lawmakers have given significantly more power to the Service, enabling them to work more efficiently. These powers are, among others: the possibility to put taps on phones, to enter homes of people suspected of being involved in terrorist activities without them knowing, or to detain and question people. This all under the supervision of specially appointed judges, much like the system already in place in the policing system with what are called <b>examining</b> <b>magistrates.</b> This adjustment of the system has made the Security Service more like its kins in other countries. They are, however, not yet as strong as the services in Britain or France. The change in policy had been in the loop since several years, but recent events gave the final impulse for change. One of these was the escape of Fehriye Erdal.|$|R

5000|$|A {{public outcry}} greeted the accusations made against her, {{as she was}} {{considered}} to be of a woman of very pious character, who lived in amity with her neighbours, and had a reputation for benevolence as well as piety: even her neighbor Sarah Holton, who had accused Rebecca of acting quite unreasonably in a quarrel over some trespassing pigs, later changed her mind and spoke in Rebecca's defence. Thirty-nine of the most prominent members of the community signed a petition on Nurse's behalf. At age 71, {{she was one of the}} oldest accused. The <b>examining</b> <b>magistrates,</b> John Hathorne and Jonathan Corwin, who normally regarded the guilt of the accused as self-evident, took a notably different attitude in Rebecca's case, as they also did in the case of her sister Mary Eastey. They told Rebecca openly that if she was innocent, they prayed that God would show her innocence, for [...] "it is a sad thing to see church members accused". Hathorne was no doubt influenced by the fact that his sister Elizabeth Porter was a close friend of Rebecca, and one of her staunchest defenders.|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of a new millennium it seems a good idea to stop for a moment and take stock of the current state of forensic science. As a field of scientific research and scientific application, forensic science is a little more than a century old. Forensic science may be said to have begun in 1887 with the simultaneous publication of A. Conan Doyle’s A Study in Scarlet and Hans Gross’s Handbuch für Untersuchungsrichter. Conan Doyle’s novel introduced to the world the character of Sherlock Holmes, whose literary career would popularize the use of physical evidence in criminal investigations. Gross’s manual for <b>examining</b> <b>magistrates</b> suggests ways in which the expertise of chemists, biologists, geologists, and other natural scientists could contribute to investigations. Gross’s book was translated into a number of languages and went through various updated editions during the course of the century. The intervening century saw the development and application of fingerprinting, firearm and tool mark identification, forensic chemistry, forensic biology, forensic toxicology, forensic odontology, forensic pathology, and forensic engineering. Increasingly, the judicial systems of the industrial nations of the world have come to rely upon the expertise of scientists in a variety of disciplines. In most advanced countries, virtually all criminal prosecutions now involve the presentation of scientific testimony. This has had the beneficial effect of diminishing the reliance of courts on eyewitness testimony and defendant confessions...|$|R
