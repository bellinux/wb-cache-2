5|$|The United States has 154 {{protected}} areas known as National Forests covering 188,336,179 acres (762,169km2/294,275 sq. mi). The National Forests are {{managed by the}} U.S. Forest Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The first National Forest was established as the Yellowstone Park Timber and Land Reserve on March 30, 1891, then in the Department of the Interior. In 1897, the Organic Act provided purposes for which <b>forest</b> <b>reserves</b> could be established, including to protect the forest, secure water supplies, and supply timber. With the Forest Reserve Act of 1891, the President of the United States was given the power to set aside <b>forest</b> <b>reserves</b> in the public domain. With the Transfer Act of 1905, <b>forest</b> <b>reserves</b> {{became part of the}} U.S. Department of Agriculture in the newly created U.S. Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|Adams and {{the lands}} {{surrounding}} it were initially set aside {{as part of}} the Mount Rainier Forest Reserve under the Department of the Interior in 1897. Eight years later, in 1905, the Bureau of Forestry, later the Forest Service, was created under the Department of Agriculture and all the <b>Forest</b> <b>Reserves</b> were transferred to the new agency. In 1907, the <b>Forest</b> <b>Reserves</b> were renamed to National Forests and in 1908, the Rainier National Forest was divided among three Forests. The southern half became the Columbia National Forest. The name was changed in 1949 to honor the first Chief of the Forest, Gifford Pinchot. In 1964, the lands around Mount Adams were set aside as a wilderness.|$|E

5|$|A Republican, Harrison {{was elected}} to the {{presidency}} in 1888, defeating the Democratic incumbent, Grover Cleveland. Hallmarks of Harrison's administration included unprecedented economic legislation, including the McKinley Tariff, which imposed historic protective trade rates, and the Sherman Antitrust Act. Harrison also facilitated the creation of the national <b>forest</b> <b>reserves</b> through an amendment to the Land Revision Act of 1891. During his administration six western states were admitted to the Union. In addition, Harrison substantially strengthened and modernized the U.S. Navy and conducted an active foreign policy, but his proposals to secure federal education funding as well as voting rights enforcement for African Americans were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there are}} four sites in Slovenia inscribed on the list and five sites on the {{tentative}} list. The first site in Slovenia {{to be added to}} the list was the Škocjan Caves, inscribed at the 10th UNESCO session in 1986. In the 2010s, three more sites were inscribed, all of them transnational entries: pile dwellings at Ig, part of the Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps transnational site, in 2011, Idrija, as part of the transnational site Heritage of Mercury. Almadén and Idrija, in 2012, and two <b>forest</b> <b>reserves,</b> Krokar and Snežnik – Ždrocle Virgin Forests in 2017, as a part of the extension to the site of Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and the Ancient Beech Forests of Germany. Of these four sites, Škocjan Caves and the Primeval Beech Forests are natural sites while the other two are cultural sites, as determined by the organization's selection criteria.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of habitats {{is a necessary}} step in the maintenance of biodiversity because if habitat destruction occurs, the animals and plants reliant on that habitat suffer. Many countries have enacted legislation to protect their wildlife. This may {{take the form of}} the setting up of national parks, <b>forest</b> <b>reserves</b> and wildlife reserves, or it may restrict the activities of humans with the objective of benefiting wildlife. The laws may be designed to protect a particular species or group of species, or the legislation may prohibit such activities as the collecting of bird eggs, the hunting of animals or the removal of plants. A general law on the {{protection of}} habitats may be more difficult to implement than a site specific requirement. A concept introduced in the United States in 1973 involves protecting the critical habitat of endangered species, and a similar concept has been incorporated into some Australian legislation.|$|E

5|$|The royal {{antelope}} {{has been}} categorised as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated {{the total population}} to be about 62,000, however {{this is likely to}} be an underestimate. The populations are feared to be declining due to habitat deterioration and expanding human settlement. A significant threat to the survival of this antelope is hunting for bushmeat; it is seldom hunted in Sierra Leone and Liberia, whereas it is a major source of bushmeat in Côte d'Ivoire. Protected areas where the royal antelope occurs include the Tai National Park, Haut Bandama Fauna and Flora Reserve and Mabi-Yaya Classified Forest (Côte d'Ivoire); Kakum National Park and Assin-Attandanso Game Production Reserve (Ghana); Ziama and Diecke <b>Forest</b> <b>Reserves</b> (Guinea); Tiwai Island and Gola Rainforest National Park (Sierra Leone).|$|E
