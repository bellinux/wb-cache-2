5|$|The {{interiors}} were streamlined {{as much as}} possible, without traditional touches such as baseboard moldings. <b>Indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> {{was used}} throughout. Curves were abundant, with rounded fireplaces topped with <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> and a round dining room with floor-to-ceiling windows. Rounded balcony edges were set off by rounded bay windows. The bedrooms included circular dressing rooms with ample closet space. In some of the units, glass brick was used as partition material.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a 777-style interior, {{known as}} the Boeing Signature Interior, debuted on the 767-400ER. Subsequently adopted for all new-build 767s, the Signature Interior {{features}} even larger overhead bins, <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting,</b> and sculpted, curved panels. The 767-400ER also received larger windows derived from the 777. Older 767s can be retrofitted with the Signature Interior. Some operators have adopted a simpler modification {{known as the}} Enhanced Interior, featuring curved ceiling panels and <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> with minimal modification of cabin architecture, as well as aftermarket modifications such as the NuLook 767 package by Heath Tecna.|$|E
5|$|Over the Stock Exchange floor, Pflueger {{mounted a}} ceiling {{composed}} of interconnected sheet metal strips above {{which he used}} <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> to soften the edges and reduce shadows made by traders on the floor below. The result was so effective that Pflueger used it on a much larger scale above the audience seating at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, where it extended from and formed a continuity with the incised art on the proscenium. In Oakland, Pflueger flanked the stage with structures {{that appeared to be}} pillars supporting the proscenium but were instead layered, curved sheets of thin metal behind which lighting instruments cast light indirectly to give the columns a suffused glow. In 1931, he used the same concept to frame the stage at the Bal Tabarin (now Bimbo's 365 Club), and to bring a changing palette of color to the ceiling above the dance floor. Pflueger filed for and, in 1934, received two architectural lighting design patents, one for his ceiling grid with <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> and one for the thin metal panels hiding lighting instruments. He used the patented ceiling grid once more in the Patent Leather Bar, in 1939.|$|E

5|$|Many Metro {{stations}} {{were designed by}} Chicago architect Harry Weese, and are examples of late-20th century modern architecture. With their heavy use of exposed concrete and repetitive design motifs, Metro stations display aspects of Brutalist design. The stations also reflect the influence of Washington's neoclassical architecture in their overarching coffered ceiling vaults. Weese worked with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based lighting designer Bill Lam on the <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> used throughout the system. All of Metro's original Brutalist stations are found in Downtown Washington, D.C. and neighboring urban corridors of Arlington, Virginia, while newer stations incorporate simplified cost-efficient designs.|$|E
5|$|Materials used in {{the station}} are {{expected}} to last at least 100 years; include granite tile, ceramic tile, stainless steel panels on the walls, painted steel panels on the ceilings, energy-efficient fluorescent lamps and LEDs, and mesh; and are supposed to conform to New York City Transit criteria, including slip-resistance. The station also uses acoustic ceiling tiles to reduce noise, in addition to using <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting.</b> The station is also compliant with National Fire Protection Association standards, despite its extreme depth, {{as it can be}} evacuated in six minutes in case of fire, and the platform can be cleared within four minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Nassers and Naify {{contracted}} with Pflueger in early 1926 to build three large movie theaters in central California cities. They assigned Pflueger {{the design of}} the Tulare Theatre (1927) in Tulare, the Senator Theatre (1928) in Chico and the State Theatre (1928) in Oroville. The $250,000 Tulare Theatre (now demolished) featured motifs based on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon. Pflueger included zigzag patterns in the twin-towered facade trimmed in neon accents, and brought Streamline Moderne stylings to the interior via sweeping curves in steel banister railings as well as Mayan touches in the stepped mirrors. The $250,000 State Theatre appeared Spanish Colonial with its tiled roof and concrete bas-relief exterior, but turned to Streamline Moderne in a 1,529-seat interior that featured chrome railings, plush carpet and <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting.</b> Aztec elements were incorporated in the proscenium design. The $300,000 Senator Theatre was delayed in construction by the discovery of running water under the foundation, a condition that required channelization and pumps. The movie palace's eclectic theme was largely Egyptian with Moorish, Asian and Aztec details dominated by a landmark tower topped by a giant faceted amber glass gem lit from within.|$|E

5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs {{such as the}} Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker {{to show off the}} new cocktail lounge in photographs.|$|E
5|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld {{continued}} the plot line established in Legend. Crystal Dynamics used {{new technology to}} improve the character for seventh generation consoles, focusing on improving realism. The dirt accumulation and water cleansing mechanic from Legend was altered to be a real-time mechanic that can involve the entire game environment. To achieve a more natural appearance, the developers added spherical harmonics to provide <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> to in-game objects like Lara Croft. Crystal Dynamics made the character model more complex and detailed than previous instalments, featuring more texture layers that determine the appearance of shadows and reflective light on it, and using skeletal animation to portray believable movement. The number of polygons in the model increased to 32,000. The developers enhanced Croft's facial model by {{increasing the number of}} polygons, bones used in the animation skeleton, and graphical shaders in the face to add more detail and expressive capabilities. The hair was created as a real-time cloth simulation to further add realism to its shape and movement. The developers kept Croft's hair tied back because they felt a real person would not want it flying around while performing dangerous manoeuvres. The character's body size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions.|$|E

40|$|Inserting virtual {{objects in}} real camera images with correct {{lighting}} {{is an active}} area of research. Current methods use a high dynamic range camera with a fish-eye lens to capture the incoming illumination. The main problem with this approach is the limitation to distant illumination. Therefore, {{the focus of our}} work is a real-time description of both near - and far-field illumination for interactive movement of virtual objects in the camera image of a real room. The daylight, which is coming in through the windows, produces a spatially varying distribution of <b>indirect</b> <b>light</b> in the room; therefore a near-field description of incoming light is necessary. Our approach is to measure the daylight from outside and to simulate the resulting <b>indirect</b> <b>light</b> in the room. To accomplish this, we develop a special dynamic form of the irradiance volume for real-time updates of <b>indirect</b> <b>light</b> in the room and combine this with importance sampling and shadow maps for light from outside. This separation allows object movements with interactive frame rates (10 [...] 17 fps). To verify the correctness of our approach, we compare images of synthetic objects with real objects...|$|R
25|$|Moshofsky Sports Center, {{named in}} honor of former University of Oregon {{football}} letterman (1940â€“42) and long-time university supporter Ed Moshofsky, was dedicated in August 1998, the first indoor practice and training facility in the Pacific-10 Conference. Located south of the Casanova Athletic Center, the Moshofsky Center accommodates the majority of the University's intercollegiate athletic programs. The $14.6 million facility includes an enclosed full-length artificial surface football field and 120-meter four-lane synthetic surface running track and an automated system in place to lower a batting cage for use by the softball team, as well as protective netting that transforms the facility for use by the men's and women's golf teams. A combination of <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> and two parallel skylight panels contribute to an energy efficient system which allows the flexibility to alter lighting conditions.|$|E
25|$|In the 1994 refit {{almost all}} of the {{remaining}} original decor was replaced, with Cunard opting to reverse the original design direction of QE2s designers and use the line's traditional ocean liners as inspiration. The green velvet and leather Midships Bar became the Art Deco inspired Chart Room, receiving an original, custom designed piano from Queen Mary. The (by now) blue dominated Theatre Bar was transformed into the Golden Lion Pub, which mimics a traditional Edwardian pub. Some original elements were retained including the flared columns in the Queens Room and Mid-Ships Lobby which were incorporated into the reworked designs. Unfortunately the Queen's Room's <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> from above was replaced with uplighters which reversed the original light airy effect by illuminating the lowered ceiling and leaving shadows in the ceiling's slot; and the furniture and carpet which replaced Michael Inchbald's designs were incongruous next to the flared columns and slotted ceiling.|$|E
25|$|Another room, {{designed}} by Michael Inchbald, where QE2s advanced interior design was demonstrated {{was the first}} class lounge, the Queen's Room on Quarter Deck. This space, in colours of white and tan, featured a lowered ceiling with large indirectly lit slots, which, despite reducing the ceiling height, created an impression of airy openness above {{to deal with the}} otherwise oppressive dimensions of the single storey room (c. 30m x 30m x 2.4m). In addition the structural columns were flared at the top to blend into the ceiling and to lose the visual indication of low ceiling height that straight columns would have given. (The Midships Lobby copied these features but without achieving the airiness.) Michael Inchbald repeated the flaring of the columns in the bases of his tables and leather shell chairs. The <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> from above could be switched from a cool hue for summer to a warm hue for winter.|$|E
30|$|The {{columns in}} the lobby {{combines}} the flower image, opening and stretching like flower petals.

50|$|The {{heart of}} Hough Hall is its open court. The glass curtain {{wall on the}} north end allows <b>indirect</b> <b>light</b> to {{permeate}} the entire building. Itâ€™s strategically designed to create an interplay between {{the inside of the}} building and those who are outside. The inviting construction generates a welcoming atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed to}} be energy efficient, with large aluminum louvers on the south face running the height of the building. Originally, they turned with the angle of the sun throughout the day to allow more <b>indirect</b> <b>light</b> into the building. No longer operable, they are now locked in one position.|$|R
25|$|The Columbus Avenue {{site was}} {{originally}} {{known as the}} Bal Tabarin, a nightclub that featured big band music and a multi-act floor show including a line of dancing showgirls. Restaurateur and businessman Bob Grison partnered with popular bandleader Tom Gerun (born Gerunovitch) and Frank Martinelli, manager of a nightclub called the Roof Garden, to establish a nightclub in 1930. In 1931, {{in anticipation of the}} repeal of Prohibition in the United States, architect Timothy L. Pflueger was contracted to create for the nightclub a stage for live music and dance shows, and a comfortable and sophisticated cocktail bar atmosphereâ€”unusual for the day, as most bars were not decorated to appeal to women. The bar itself was implemented in the Moderne style later called Art Deco. The stage design used Pflueger's patented <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting</b> hidden behind curved strips of decorative metal. The color coming from behind the faÃ§ade could be changed smoothly from one hue to another. Two years later, with alcohol bans officially lifted nationwide, the Bal Tabarin was issued California's first new liquor license, and in 1934 Pflueger gave the nightclub a quick renovation. The popularity of the club netted for Pflueger a series of contracts to design cocktail lounges for prominent hotels in San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, the 757-300 debuted a {{redesigned}} interior {{derived from}} the Next Generation 737 and 777, including sculptured ceiling panels, <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting,</b> and larger overhead bins with an optional continuous handrail built into their base for the entire cabin length. Centerline storage containers mounted in the aisle ceiling for additional escape rafts and other emergency equipment were also added. [...] The 757-300's interior later became an option on all new [...] In 2000, with wheeled carry-on baggage becoming more popular, Delta Air Lines began installing overhead bin extensions on their [...] to provide additional storage space, and American Airlines did the same in 2001. The larger bins are part of aftermarket interior upgrades which include updated ceiling panels and lighting.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} 777 interior, {{also known}} as the Boeing Signature Interior, features curved panels, larger overhead bins, and <b>indirect</b> <b>lighting.</b> Seating options range from four to six abreast in first class up to 10 across in economy. [...] The 777's windows were the largest of any current commercial airliner until the 787, and measure [...] by [...] in size (all models outside the 777-8 and -9). The cabin also features [...] "Flexibility Zones", which entails deliberate placement of water, electrical, pneumatic, and other connection points throughout the interior space, allowing airlines to move seats, galleys, and lavatories quickly and more easily when adjusting cabin arrangements. Several aircraft have also been fitted with VIP interiors for non-airline use. Boeing designed a hydraulically damped toilet seat cover hinge that closes slowly.|$|E
50|$|Often, {{clerestory}} windows also shine onto {{interior wall}} surfaces painted white or another light color. These walls are placed {{so as to}} reflect <b>indirect</b> <b>light</b> to interior areas where it is needed. This method {{has the advantage of}} reducing the directionality of light to make it softer and more diffuse, reducing shadows.|$|R
50|$|Radiosity is {{a method}} which {{attempts}} to simulate {{the way in which}} directly illuminated surfaces act as <b>indirect</b> <b>light</b> sources that illuminate other surfaces.

5000|$|The central {{space of}} the building, a {{pillared}} hall, was the main reception area of the house. It measures about 8 meters square.
