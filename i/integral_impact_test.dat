40|$|The <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> {{represents}} one of the main tools used by clinicians to assess the presence and severity of a student athlete's concussion (ImPACT Applications, Inc., 2011). Although past research has verified the utility of the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> for assessing cognitive status after concussion, no research has examined the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test's</b> potential for predicting athletic performance in non-concussed athletes (ImPACT Applications, Inc., 2011). This study investigated whether particular composite scores on the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> can predict athletic performance. The composite scores on the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> include Verbal Memory, Visual Memory, Visual Motor Speed, Reaction Time, and Impulse Control. Previous literature showed that broad cognitive domains such as impulse control correlated with athletic performance (Kida & Matsumura, 2005). University of Arizona baseball players' freshman <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> scores were correlated with their freshman year batting statistics, including batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage, strikeouts, and walks. The results showed no significant association between measures from the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> and the batting statistics. Therefore, the study suggests that the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> may possess no predictive ability for athletic performance in a non-concussed population...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the large}} volume {{consumption}} of polyolefins, {{the treatment of the}} resulting solid waste is becoming a major concern. One possible utilization of the polyolefin wastes is to form blends from recycled polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). This study is a preliminary investigation on the impact fracture behaviour for the PP/PE blends. The <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> method employed in this study includes the conventional and instrumented Izod <b>impact</b> <b>tests,</b> the instrumented Charpy <b>impact</b> <b>test,</b> and the instrumented drop weight plate <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> (IDWPIT). In both conventional and instrumented Izod <b>impact</b> <b>testing,</b> PP homopolymer and PP/LDPE blend have similar impact strengths, while PP/HDPE blend exhibits slightly lower impact strength. However, the instrumented Charpy <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> indicates that both PP/LDPE and PP/HDPE have similar impact strengths, and both are slightly lower than PP homopolymer. This suggests that the type of <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> employed is playing {{an important role in the}} impact fracture behaviour of the PP/PE blends. The effect of temperature on the impact fracture behaviour for the PP/PE blends was evaluated by means of the Charpy and drop weight plate <b>impact</b> <b>tests.</b> During the <b>tests,</b> <b>impact</b> strengths reduced with decreasing testing temperature. In the Charpy <b>impact</b> <b>test,</b> the <b>impact</b> strength for PP homopolymer was higher than those of the two PP/PE blends at both 20 and 0 °C.
