Overall, both rich and poor southerners ate spicier and more pungent food than elsewhere in the early colonies, and feasting was {{an important part of}} life for all social classes.|$|E

5|$|Some seabird {{species have}} benefited from fisheries, {{particularly}} from discarded fish and offal. These discards compose 30% of the <b>food</b> <b>of</b> seabirds in the North Sea, for example, and compose up to 70% of the total <b>food</b> <b>of</b> some seabird populations. This can have other impacts; for example, {{the spread of the}} northern fulmar through the United Kingdom is attributed in part to the availability of discards. Discards generally benefit surface feeders, such as gannets and petrels, to the detriment of pursuit divers like penguins.|$|E

40|$|Irrespective of the {{existence}} of potentially pathogenic organisms carried by animals, <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> animal origin remain the prime nutrition of humans world-wide. As such, food safety continues to be a global concern primarily to safeguard public health and to promote international trade. Application of integrated risk-based quality assurance procedures on-farm and at slaughterhouses plays a crucial role in controlling hazards associated with <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> animal origin. In the present paper we examine safety assurance systems and associated value chains for <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> animal origin based on historical audit results of some Southern African countries with thriving export trade in animal products, mainly to identify areas for improvement. Among the key deficiencies identified were: i) failure to keep pace with scientific advances related to the ever-changing food supply chain; ii) lack of effective national and regional intervention strategies to curtail pathogen transmission and evolution, notably the zoonotic Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli; and iii) a lack of effective methods to reduce contamination <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> wildlife origin. The introduction <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> wildlife origin for domestic consumption and export markets seriously compounds already existing conflicts in legislation governing food supply and safety. This analysis identifies gaps required to improve the safety <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> wildlife origin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe authors {{report on}} {{the current status of}} work on {{residues}} of veterinary medicinal products and, in particular, antimicrobial residues in <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> animal origin. This review focuses on residues of veterinary antimicrobials, antimicrobials used in livestock production, the concept of residues, and antimicrobial residues in <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> animal origin. Only one antimicrobial substance has been approved in the West African Economic and Monetary Union, compared with 16 substances in Benin and 56 in the European Union. The issue of antimicrobial residues in <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> animal origin has rarely been a serious concern in developing countries, in contrast to the situation in Europe. However, while the prevalence of veterinary drug residues in <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> animal origin is less than 1 % in Europe, in some African countries it can be as high as 94 %. Antimicrobial residues in <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> animal origin can cause allergies, cancer, alterations in the intestinal flora, bacterial resistance and the inhibition of fermentation in the dairy industry. The harmonisation of regulations in Africa could reduce the circulation of prohibited antimicrobials and lead to the implementation of a plan for the control and surveillance of residues from veterinary medicinal products in <b>foods</b> <b>of</b> animal origin...|$|R

5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in beak size {{may have}} affected behaviour. Such dimorphism is common in other parrots, for example in the palm cockatoo and the New Zealand kaka.

Similarly, the large difference {{between male and female}} head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex, though it is impossible to determine how.|$|E

5|$|The yellow-orange {{pigments}} of the smalleye hammerhead seem to {{have been}} acquired from the penaeid shrimp Xiphopenaeus kroyeri, the main <b>food</b> <b>of</b> juvenile sharks, and from sea catfish and their eggs, the main <b>food</b> <b>of</b> adults. The golden color may serve to conceal it from predators such as larger sharks. This species is viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Females bear litters of five to 19 pups every year following a gestation period of 10 months. Reproductive seasonality, litter size, and size at maturity vary between geographical regions. Because of its abundance, the smalleye hammerhead is an economically important bycatch of artisanal gillnet fisheries throughout its range and is used as food. In recent years, overfishing has caused marked declines in its numbers off Trinidad, northern Brazil, and probably elsewhere. Coupled with its low reproductive rate, this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature to list it under vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|Another {{similarity}} {{with the}} stegosaurs is the narrow head, which might indicate a selective diet consisting of high-quality fodder. However, Barrett {{pointed out that}} for an animal the size of Scelidosaurus, with a large gut allowing efficient fermentation, the intake of easily digestible <b>food</b> <b>of</b> high energetic value was less important than with smaller animals, that are often critically dependent on it. Norman concluded that Scelidosaurus fed on low scrubby vegetation, with a height up to one metre. Raising itself on its hindlimbs alone, could have vertically increased the feeding envelope and was perhaps anatomically possible, but Norman doubted it was a relevant part of its behaviour.|$|E

According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
