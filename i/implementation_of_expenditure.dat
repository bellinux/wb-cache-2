In terms of austerity in which public authorities operate in Romania, balancing local budgets is a current topic and strongly debated. It is a clear difference between earning income communities and communities of sufficient own funds set up not doing any maintenance to cover the village. Communities who occupy the first places have economic, social, demographic benefits, that enable continuous development. Although there is always the tendency to criticize communities that do not have sufficient income,it must be seen that in Europe today the basic concept that builds on development theory is economic and social cohesion. It is believed that the uneven development of the territories actually reflect the economic weaknesses of the combination of which led to political and economic instability. An alternative to this situation is the solidarity of local communities, calculated to maintain a balance between both communities. It is believed that overall healthy economic development can be achieved by a balanced territorial development, and not by widening the existing gaps.

The observed faulty allocations <b>of</b> public <b>expenditures,</b> coupled with weaknesses in the budgetary process suggest major potential gains for improving the efficiency and effectiveness <b>of</b> public <b>expenditure</b> program in ANRE. These areas of reform relate to whether: (a) public expenditures are being used to perform/provide public roles/goods vs. private ones; (b) choice of policy instruments (i. e., expenditure program vs. other market-based instruments) is most cost-effective; (c) public expenditures are optimally allocated across policy instruments, agencies and levels of government, regions, and type of expenditures; (d) mechanisms for funding and other related budgetary procedures promote efficient and effective allocation of public expenditures; and (e) cost-effective mechanisms for timely monitoring, evaluation, and impact analysis <b>of</b> public <b>expenditures</b> are adopted.
