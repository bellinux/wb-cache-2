Two subsurface drains, each installed with a different method, were monitored from 1980 to 1984 to compare the effect of methods of <b>drain</b> <b>installation</b> on water table heights. Subsurface drains installed with a chain trencher had lower water table heights throughout the crop growing season {{in comparison to the}} water table heights in areas drained by the plow method. Based on these water table measurements, subsurface drains installed with a chain trencher appeared to remove more drainage water from the soil than did subsurface drains installed with a plow. Data collected on corn and soybean yields from the various tillage experiments, drained by two methods of <b>drain</b> <b>installation</b> were compared.

40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} to stabilize slopes and landslides using driven, geotextile wick drains rather than drilled polyvinyl chloride or steel drains. Compared to drilled horizontal drains, wick drains can be significantly deformed without ruptur-ing. They resist clogging, {{and they can be}} installed quickly and economically by workers with no pre-vious training. Since 1998, more than 170 drains, totaling more than 2, 600 m (8, 600 ft) in length, have been installed at eight sites in Missouri, Colorado, and Indiana. At three of the sites, drains were installed at a density and layout considered to be appropriate for full-scale stabilization: 27 to 44 drains were driven at each site, averaging 15 to 20 m (50 – 70 ft) in length. A method was developed to accurately estimate the groundwater-table profile after <b>drain</b> <b>installation,</b> and computer slope-stability analysis using this method showed significant in-creases (10 – 40 percent) in factors of safety after <b>drain</b> <b>installation.</b> The limitations of the methodology should be recognized: it may be applied in specific situations requiring relatively short (< 30 – 45 m, or < 100 – 150 ft) drains in materials ranging from soft to very stiff (up to 30 blows/ft in standard penetra-tion tests).

40|$|A {{system of}} {{surcharge}} load combined with vertical drains {{to speed up}} consolidation of soft soil by reducing the drainage path {{is one of the}} most efficient and economical ground improvement techniques. In the field, conventional theories including smear zone have been commonly employed to predict the radial consolidation behaviour induced by vertical drains in soft clay. One of the key parameters in conventional analysis is the use of mean coefficient of volume compressibility and soil permeability, which are often assumed to be constant. The effect of <b>drain</b> <b>installation</b> on the soil compressibility of the in situ clay structure is often ignored. Laboratory testing has shown that the soil compressibility and permeability can vary nonlinearly over a considerable range of applied surcharge pressure, and both these properties can be affected during the <b>drain</b> <b>installation.</b> This study presents a mathematical model of radial consolidation via vertical drains incorporating the variations of soil compressibility and permeability as well as highlighting the effects of <b>drain</b> <b>installation</b> on those parameters. The main differences between the proposed and conventional models are elucidated, in terms of stress history and preloading (surcharge) pressure. The effects of preconsolidation pressure and the magnitude of applied preloading are examined through the dissipation of average excess pore pressure and associated settlement. Supported by experimental observations, the proposed theory is validated with field data of a selected case study in the town of Ballina, New South Wales, Australia...|$|R

Ks was measured at a field site at Nashua, Iowa, with 1. 2 -m (4 -ft) deep drain lines installed with a trenchless plow and with a chain trencher at four depths [0 to 150, 150 to 450, 450 to 750, 750 to 1000 mm (0 to 6, 6 to 18, 18 to 30, 30 to 40 in.) ] using the Guelph permeameter (in situ technique) and the constant head permeameter method (laboratory technique) on undisturbed soil cores which {{were removed from the}} field site. Ks values were 10 to 130 times greater for the constant head permeameter compared to the Guelph permeameter method and were significantly different at all depths for the two measurement methods.

40|$|SYNOPSIS: The use of {{vertical}} drains {{to accelerate the}} consolidation of soft soils has become a cost effective alternative {{to the use of}} pile foundations at many sites. This paper presents a case history of the use {{of vertical}} drains to accelerate the consolidation of 20 to 25 feet of low shear strength, highly compressible soils, under embankments of 12 to 25 feet in height. ~o separate vertical <b>drain</b> <b>installations</b> at the project site allowed the use of a shallow foundat~on system for approximately one-half of the foundations. This resulted in a significant savings in foundation costs and allowed an ambitious "fast track " construction schedule to be met.

40|$|In 1992, Queensland Department of Main Roads was {{commissioned}} {{to monitor and}} interpret {{the findings of a}} fully instrumented trial embankment in Area 2 A of the Sunshine Motorway, South East Queensland. This embankment was used to observe the foundation response upon loading, and evaluate the effectiveness of various ground improvement techniques on the soft, organic clays characteristic of this region. The principal focus {{of this paper is to}} compare the numerical predictions obtained from the finite difference analysis with field data obtained during the construction phase. The numerical analysis was undertaken using the finite difference program, FLAC, and deformations predicted on the basis of a fully coupled Biot consolidation model.

40|$|Vertical drains {{accelerate}} consolidation {{and as such}} {{they are}} a very effective and popular ground improvement method. When vacuum preloading is applied with vertical drains, consolidation increases even more and the stability of an embankment is enhanced due to the inward lateral movement exerted by vacuum preloading. Previous analytical models developed to predict consolidation when vacuum preloading is used with vertical drains assumed average compressibility and permeability values within the applied stress range. Even though the smear effects were incorporated into the solution by considering a reduced but constant permeability inside the smear zone, the actual variation of permeability was ignored in the vacuum preloading models developed. More importantly, compressibility of the in-situ clay structure due to the installation of a mandrel driven drain was often ignored as well. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop an analytical solution for vacuum preloading which accurately represents the variations in compressibility and permeability in actual ground conditions as a result of <b>drain</b> <b>installations.</b> The disturbed zone created by <b>drain</b> <b>installation</b> can be characterised by using the extent of the smear zone and the ratio of the horizontal coefficient of permeability in the undisturbed zone and in the smear zone. These parameters were obtained using laboratory experiments performed on large-scale tests of samples of remoulded clay. Laboratory tests performed on samples extracted around an actual drain installed in field conditions indicated that soil was subjected to more smear under field conditions than was previously anticipated. Furthermore, this study revealed that the compressibility of soil was also adversely affected by the changes to the soil structure, and therefore it was deemed imperative to capture these changes in the analytical models developed for radial consolidation with vacuum pressure. A novel mathematical model was developed to incorporate soil destructuring due to <b>drain</b> <b>installation</b> and the associated changes in compressibility as the soil is improved using vertical drains and vacuum preloading. A more realistic distribution of permeability was assumed within the smear zone and the variation in permeability with the void ratio was also considered in the analysis. The predictions of average excess pore water pressure, degree of consolidation and resultant settlement, and the consolidation responses obtained using this analytical model were compared with other existing models. The importance of this model is illustrated via the case study simulations of two embankments in Australia and China that were stabilised with vertical drains; the proposed model gave more accurate predictions than the previous models. To model more realistic soil behaviour, variations in soil compressibility and permeability were incorporated into the latest edition of the PLAXIS finite element package which enabled the application of vacuum pressure, and very good agreement was observed between simulated results and the field data. Laboratory tests were conducted on reconstituted and in-situ soil samples obtained from a soft clay site at Ballina, using the newly designed consolidation apparatus that can enable radial consolidation with vacuum pressure. These experiment results enabled the empirical relationship between the vacuum surcharge ratio and lateral strain to be postulated, and they can also be used as a design tool in initial embankment planning...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} mainly {{concerned}} with a laboratory study {{to investigate the}} effect of smear due to vertical <b>drain</b> <b>installation.</b> The extent of the smear zone around a vertical drain was studied utilizing a large-scale consolidometer apparatus. The test results reveal that {{a significant reduction in}} the horizontal permeability takes place toward a central drain, whereas the vertical permeabilty remains relatively unchanged. The radius of the smear zone was estimated to be a factor of four to five times the radius of the central drain (mandrel), and the measured ratio of horizontal to vertical permeability approached unity at the drain-soil interface. The laboratory measured settlements are subsequently compared with the predictions based on the theory of Hansbo and the finite element method. It is of relevance to note that the inclusion of the correct variation of permeability ratios of the smear zone in the plane strain finite element analysis improves the accuracy of settlement predictions...|$|R
40|$|Vertical drains {{are used}} to improve soft soil by {{providing}} a horizontal drainage path along which excess pore water pressures caused by a surcharge can dissipate faster than by a vertical drainage path alone. Despite laboratory evidence that, owing to <b>drain</b> <b>installation,</b> permeability decreases gradually towards the drain (Chai 2 ̆ 6 Miura, 1999; Sharma 2 ̆ 6 Xiao, 2000; Hawlader et al., 2002), most analytical models (e. g.

Assumed radii for a constant-permeability smear zone {{range in size from}} 1. 6 to 4 times the quivalent drain or mandrel radius (Hansbo, 1981; Indraratna 2 ̆ 6 Redana, 1998). By incorporating a more realistic linear permeability distribution, the effect of overlapping smear zones can be investigated. Overlapping smear zones provide an explanation for a minimum drain spacing, below which no increase in the rate of consolidation is achieved.

40|$|<b>Installation</b> of {{vertical}} <b>drains</b> {{to provide an}} alternate drainage path {{is one of the}} most popular methods for accelerating consolidation in soft clays. Typically, these drains are band-shaped where a core made of plastic or coir is surrounded by a filter made of a synthetic fiber. The first numerical model for the consolidation process in these drains was given by Hansbo (1981) where the classical theory of consolidation was applied to an equivalent circular drain. Over the years a considerable amount of improvement has been carried out by various researchers over and above the initial model proposed by Hansbo. However, most of these numerical models tend to neglect a number of factors that might occur in a typical <b>drain</b> <b>installation</b> on the field. In this paper, we conduct a critical review of these numerical models and take a look at their assumptions and propositions. Since most of the numerical models were developed with synthetic drains as the subject, their applicability in natural drains needs to be examined. Numerical modeling in natural drains tends to become more complicated owing to effects of mandrel withdrawal and the high absorption capacity of natural fibers which introduces unsaturated zones during the initial consolidation process. All these challenges have been discussed in detail and a number of suggestions for adapting these numerical models to natural drains have been provided. Finally, we list down all the requirements of an all-encompassing numerical model that can accurately model the consolidation process in a natural/synthetic vertical drain in field conditions...|$|R
40|$|In Singapore, {{large-scale}} land reclamations are executed, {{in which}} among else Van Oord ACZ is participating. The subsoil of these reclamations often consists of soft, compressible materials, such as marine clay. Depending on the clay properties, {{the thickness of}} the soft layer and {{the thickness of the}} placed sand layer, a certain settlement will occur within a certain consolidation time. To control the occurring settlement and/or to shorten the consolidation time, different measures are available, for instance: installation of prefabricated vertical <b>drains,</b> <b>installation</b> of a temporary surcharge, a combination of vertical drainage and surcharge. The measures above are recapitulated called "soil improvement". During the tender procedure as well as during the actual execution of the reclamation works, it is of great importance to predict the settlement and consolidation time (possibly including a soil improvement) accurately. The main objective was to answer the following question: "Can a probabilistic analysis of the soil parameters and calculation models give a surplus value in the prediction of the settlement, consolidation time and the soil improvement needed?". The conventional method to calculate the consolidation time and the settlement is a deterministic one. From a set of data, a representative value is determined, which is then used in the consolidation calculations. In order to calculate the settlement and consolidation time, with stochastic variables, a Monte Carlo simulation is executed. For this purpose a model has been developed, from which the basic outline is visualised in the left figure. Risk can be defined as the product of the probability of a failure and the results of that failure, expressed in a financial value. In general one should minimise the total costs to obtain an optimal design. The minimum total costs represent the optimum combination of surcharge and vertical drainage. Probabilistic calculations increase the insight in the costs involved in a soil improvement and make an economically optimal design possible. "Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Movement {{of water}} and {{nutrients}} through subsurface drainage systems is a concern in many midwestern agricultural watersheds, including the Des Moines Lobe of Iowa. Although subsurface drainage has its benefits—it improves the productivity of croplands and generally reduces surface water runoff—these systems result in a greater volume of subsurface drainage flow to downstream water bodies, thereby increasing nitrate-nitrogen movement to the same. In order to reduce excess water movement and nitrate-nitrogen movement in these watersheds, hydraulic modifications of drainage systems are being considered as water quality management practices. At the Iowa Water Summit held at Iowa State University on November 24, 2003, {{three of the five}} work groups (Nonpoint Sources, Nutrients, and Impaired Water Restoration) identified the need for assessment and demonstration of hydrologic modifications as a new way of addressing water quality concerns, particularly nitrate-nitrogen leaching.

40|$|The Upper Jefferson River {{is one of}} {{the most}} dewatered rivers in Montana. The river exists in an intermontane basin filled with {{sediment}} transported from the Highland Mountains to the west, the Tobacco Root Mountains to the east, and the Jefferson River from the south. The Upper Jefferson River Valley is highly dependent on the Jefferson River as the main industry in the valley is agriculture. A majority of the valley is irrigated and used to grow crops, and a good portion is also used for cattle grazing. The residents of the Upper Jefferson River Valley use the aquifer as the main source of potable water. The Jefferson River is also widely used for recreation. This study took place in the Waterloo area of the Upper Jefferson River Valley, approximately 20 miles south of Whitehall, Montana. The Waterloo area provides significant groundwater base flow to the Jefferson River, which is particularly important during the late irrigation season when the river is severely dewatered, and elevated surface-water temperatures occur, creating irrigation water shortages and poor trout habitat. This area contains two springfed streams, Willow Springs and Parson’s Slough, which discharge to the Jefferson River providing cool water in the late season as well as providing the most important trout spawning habitat in the valley. The area is bordered on both the east and west by irrigation ditches, and about 60 % of the study area is irrigated. Tile drains were installed in the study area in close proximity to Parsons Slough causing some concern by neighboring residents. This study evaluated relationships between surface water, groundwater, and irrigation practices so that water managers and others can make informed management decisions about the Upper Jefferson River. Data was collected via a network of groundwater wells and surface-water sites. Additionally, water-quality samples were taken and an aquifer test was conducted to determine aquifer properties. The field data were analyzed and a groundwater budget was created in order to evaluate the aquifer. Results of the groundwater budget show that seepage from the irrigation canals and irrigation recharge have the biggest influence on recharge of the aquifer. There is significant groundwater outflow from the aquifer in the spring-fed streams as well as discharge to the Jefferson River. In comparing previous study results to this study’s results, there is no evidence of the water table decreasing due to irrigation practice changes or tile <b>drain</b> <b>installation.</b> However, given the amount of recharge irrigation practices contribute to the aquifer, if significant changes were made, they may affect groundwater elevations. Also lining the irrigation ditches would have a significant impact on the aquifer, as the amount of seepage would be greatly reduced...|$|R
40|$|In this research, analytical, {{experimental}} and numerical investigations {{were carried out}} to pursue {{a better understanding of}} the consolidation of soft clay stabilized with prefabricated vertical drains (PVD) subjected to preloading (with and without vacuum pressure application). This investigation was carried out in fourfold. First, an analytical solution based on Cylindrical Cavity Expansion analysis incorporating the Modified Cam Clay theory has been formulated to estimate the extent of the smear zone. Second, the smear zone characteristics were evaluated using a large-scale radial drainage consolidometer and then compared with predicted values. Third, the existing axisymmetric and plane strain theories of a unit cell were modified and incorporated with a linearly distributed (trapezoidal) vacuum pressure for both Darcian and non-Darcian flow. Finally, multi-drain plane strain analysis was conducted on a number of case histories taken from Australia and Thailand to study the performance of the entire embankment stabilised with vertical drains. A series of large-scale model tests were conducted using a specially designed consolidometer 650 mm diameter by 1040 mm high to study the characteristics of the smear zone. A central vertical drain was installed in soil specimens (previously placed inside a large cell) with a band shaped (rectangular, hollow) steel mandrel, during which any variations in pore water pressure along the radial direction were recorded. Then, the surcharge load was applied in stages up to 200 kPa and the clay then consolidated. At the end of consolidation, soils samples were collected from several locations in order to carry out a number of oedometer and triaxial tests to establish the variations of soil properties. It was observed that <b>drain</b> <b>installation</b> disturbed the soil immediately adjacent to it, creating a 2 ̆ 2 smear zone 2 ̆ 2 in which a change in clay properties was caused by reconsolidation due to dissipation of excess pore pressure, and remoulding due to shear from the periphery of the mandrel. The smear zone was 2 - 3 times the equivalent radius of the mandrel with horizontal permeability (in the smear zone) varying from 1. 09 to 1. 64, an average of 1. 34 times smaller than that of the undisturbed zone. The estimated extent of smear zone from the large-scale test was very close to the predicted value, based on Cavity Expansion analysis. The analytical solutions are incorporated in the finite element code (e. g. PLAXIS, ABAQUS) employing the Modified Cam Clay theory. Selected numerical analysis incorporating the proposed solution was carried out to study the behaviour of a number of case histories, in view of various ground improvement schemes applied to stabilize the soft clay foundation and the predictions are compared with available field data.

RESULTS After 60 min, the temperature was 36. 6 ± 0. 0 °C in the warm ischaemic group and 14. 6 ± 0. 1 °C in the cold ischaemic group (P < 0. 001). In the warm ischaemic group, no thrombotic material {{could be found in}} the pulmonary artery in the animals examined and in the cold ischaemic group 6. 8 ± 0. 2 ml thrombotic material was found in the pulmonary artery (P < 0. 001). In the warm ischaemic group, no thrombotic material could be found in the arterial branches of the pulmonary artery and in the cold ischaemic group 2. 3 ± 0. 1 ml thrombotic material was found in the arterial branches of the pulmonary artery (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS Warm ischaemia rather than cold ischaemia seems to protect the pulmonary graft from thrombosis in uncontrolled non-heparinized DCD pigs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe quality {{management}} of Prefabricated Vertical <b>Drain</b> (PVD) material <b>installation</b> in ground improvement works in land reclamation projects {{is a critical}} task for designers, contractors and clients alike. Only if a good {{quality management}} system is established, can the expected performance of the PVD improvement works in the field be ensured. A case study of quality management of PVD materials in the mega Changi East land reclamation Project in the Republic of Singapore is presented in this technical report. The quality management of PVD works consisted of several processes, starting from selection {{of the type of}} PVD, properties of the PVD materials and ultimate performance verification in the field. This paper describes selection of PVDs against the comprehensive specification adopted in this project. The paper also describes the selection of the PVD installation rig and accessories based on the in-situ ground conditions. Test results from quality control test laboratories such as tension, permeability and discharge capacity are also presented and discussed. This paper seeks to set a benchmark for material quality management of PVD works in large-scale PVD ground improvement projects...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Better use {{of water}} and soil {{resources}} in paddy fields, increase in rice production and farmer's income, installation of subsurface drainage system is necessary. The main goalof these systems, are aeration conditions improvement prevention of water logging, yield increase, land use increase and multiuse of the land. In different countries, installation of subsurface drainage cause yield increase and working condition on the land, but no {{research has been conducted}} in different depths and spacing. On the other hand, spacing and depth are the most important parameters in the installation of drainage systems, have a direct effect on incoming water into the drains. The aim of this research, is an investigation of the effect of subsurface drainage with different depths and spacing on discharge rate variation and water table fall, in order to analyze the improvement of water flow movement in the soil. Also, study the effect of different drainage systems on the increase of the canola yield as the second cultivation in these treatments have been compared. Materials and Methods: To measure hydraulic conductivity in different depths, the auger holes have been dug (excavated). The saturated hydraulic conductivity in these holes wasdetermined using Ernst method (1950) before installation of drainage systems. In the drainage pilot plot of Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University three subsurface drainage systems with mineral envelope have been installed. 1 - The first one with the 0. 9 m depth and 30 m spacing (D 90 L 30), 2 - The second one with 0. 65 m depth and 15 m spacing (D 0. 65 L 15) and 3 - The third one with 0. 65 m depth and spacing (D 0. 65 L 30) and one bi-level system with mineral envelope including four drains of 15 m spacing with 0. 9 m and 0. 65 m depths were installed alternatively. After auger hole equipment installations, in the middle spacing of two subsurface and water table reading possible, the water table fluctuation and drain outlet discharge rate from farm drains during canola growing season were measured on a daily basis. Also, canola yield during 4 years after drainage systems were monitored. Results and Discution: The results showed that mean discharge rates of drainage systems have increased with time and in the fourth year it was better than first and second years. Duringthe second year, the highest discharge rate onthe first day was in the low depth treatment and after 3 days the discharge rates become the difference among less. In the third year, the discharge rates of high spacing drains (D 0. 65 L 30) have become higher than of spacing drains (D 0. 65 L 15) discharge rates. But, in the first day its discharge rate was less and one can conclude that it is due to horizontal flow. With passing time and soil structure improvement, one can observe better yield from drains with higher spacing (30 m) also. By performance of drainage and soil conditions improvement in the third and fourth year, the deeper drainage systems have becomes better and water table fall of deep drain discharge rate and soil condition improvement in these systems become higher. In bi-level drainage, by increasing deep percolation, the water table fall in this treatment increased with time. Also, based on monitoring water table, in the first and second years after 5 th day and in the third and fourth years after 4 th day the water tables of deep drains decreased to lower depth drains. Due to heavy soil in paddy fields and existence of hardpan, the performance of low depth drains in falling water table was better in the first years. With passing time and performance of drainage the conditions for water movement in the soil become better and performance of deep drainage systems improved and at the fourth year, deep drainage systems had better performance in draining water with respect to low depth drainage systems. Also, canola yield as second cultivation, has increased from first to fourth year and along with important of soil aeration conditions and performance of drainage systems, the grain yield hasincreased in different drainage treatments. The results showed a direct relationship between improvement of system performance and increase in grain yield. In the second year, grain yield increased in all treatments. On the other hand, the yield under drainage systems with deeper depth (D 0. 9 L 30) even higher in the 2 nd and 4 th years than with low depth drain (D 0. 65 L 30). This was because of more fall in water table levels during days after rainfall and also with next rainfall, saturation of soil up to surface layer in the plots with deeper drains were performed later and it may not reach up to thesoil surface. Conclusion: Due to betterconditions of deep drains and with higher spacing in the improvement of paddy field use and also less environmental harm use of drains with higher spacing are recommended for these lands. On the other hand,a low increase in drain depth from 0. 65 m to 0. 9 m along with increase in spacing of 30 m with respect to 15 m and even with 0. 65 m depth, will have less cost. Due to decrease in the costs of <b>drain</b> <b>installation</b> with higher spacing, due to improvement of conditions, the performance of these systems in 2 to 3 years one can have cheaper drainage systems in the longest time and will improve the economic situation of farmers due to higher yield...|$|R
40|$|In Malaysia, {{soft soil}} {{deposits}} ar e widespread {{all over the}} country and mostly found in the coastal area. In general, soft soil posses low strength and high compressibil ity and thus having low bearing capacity. The soil needs to be improved to avoid excessive settlement and prevent stability failure that affecting the safety of the infrastructure. Preloading is one of the mo st effective and economical methods to reduce settlement and improve the bearing capacity of the soft soil. The application of preloading does help in applying stress to the existing soil, thus increasing the pore water pressure. Consolidation happens when the wate r in soil is squeezed out from the soil matrix. With the elimination of water from the soil, the soil strength is increased. However, this method does not have the advantages of speeding up the process of pore water pressure dissipation hence settlement might takes years to complete. The preloading method is usually co mbined with vertical drain. The use of prefabricated vertical drain in a soft soil layer can shorten the treatment time of ground by increasing the rate of consolidation. The consolidation time depends on the travelling distance of the water to flow out from the soil matrix. The <b>installation</b> of vertical <b>drain</b> shor tens the drainage path by allowing the water to flow horizontally towards the drain, and drain out to the soil surface through the vertical <b>drain.</b> Generally, the <b>installation</b> of vertic al drain is carried out in an extensive area. The behavior of ve rtical drain can be expressed as axisymmetric unit cell. There are studies carried out by researchers on vertical drain using linear model, e. g. embankment on soft Bangkok clay (Bergado 1993). Beside s, analytical methods are also used by designers assuming that consolidation happens in uniform soil column with linear compressibility characteristics without any lateral movement...|$|R
40|$|Skanska Sweden has {{produced}} low energy housing since 2009 using prefabricated concrete sandwich elements, as a cost-effective {{way to reach}} high quality and excellent energy performance. Some of these projects have faced problems related to water infiltration due to rainfall during construction, resulting in extra resources for drying the structure, time delays and complicated leakage investigations. If moisture levels remain high when the construction phase is completed, there is risk of moisture damage or inconvenience for the users. Initial interviews and observations at construction- and manufacturing sites reveal some details with large potential for improvement; vertical sandwich element joints, connections between external walls and slabs, external walls and foundation and between balcony door and balcony slab. To improve these details, existing connections and joints were assessed using a list of functional requirements according to Swedish national building regulations that each connection need to fulfil to ensure proper functioning of the building. Suggestions for improvement were gathered and new ideas generated. These propositions were tested by interviewing experts in material purchasing, construction techniques and structural engineering. The study shows {{that there are many}} possible ways to improve connection details to avoid water infiltration without increasing energy losses or air leakage. - Vertical joints can be protected from rain using a P-shaped rubber profile or by changing the geometry of the external facade panel. - Leakage from massive concrete slabs into sandwich walls can be prevented by an vertically extended part of the inner concrete panel or a <b>draining</b> channel for <b>installations.</b> - Self-adhesive sealing strips covering the top of the sandwich elements can prevent moistening of the building materials during transport and construction. - Inserting a rubber or bitumen membrane to the inner concrete panel during casting can ensure drainage and prevent leakage to lower structures such as cellars, terraces or parking garages. - Channels in the balcony slab can ensure drainage without reducing accessibility for disabled persons. However, many of the suggested details increase cost and complicate the assembly of the building. Further studies are required to identify the probability and the consequences of water infiltration to assess the accepted cost of preventing actions. Practical experiments are also needed to establish the performance of each new detail. Details should be better presented on drawings to avoid misunderstandings and it is highly necessary that the designer always consider the constructability of a detail. This master thesis does not include finished solutions, but a theoretical evaluation of alternatives of which some have potential to enter Skanska’s system for standardized components after further evaluation.
