Certain controlled parameters exist, such as temperature or stroke length, which are usually identified and controlled through a systematic approach.

In this study, a pressure dependent plasticity model has been incorporated into a FE model of shot peening {{to shed light on}} the residual stress formation mechanism. Since shot velocity is the <b>key</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> to dominate the impact energy which determines the deformation state of surface material and the resultant residual stress, a new kinematic model of shots has also been developed by incorporating air drag and travel distance inside and outside the peening nozzle.

40|$|A paste {{thickener}} produces underflow with a {{high solids}} concentration by removing water from a dilute suspension. Paste thickening technology has been gradually gaining acceptance in the mining industry. Some of the main challenges in thickening are the complex dynamics due to severe interactions between operating parameters {{and the existence of}} a large range of process time constants. Additionally, being a downstream process, paste thickeners suffer from fluctuating feed conditions from upstream processes. Furthermore, the operation of paste thickeners involves a tight operating window as the underflow properties are sensitive to small changes in concentration. The above challenges motivate this work to develop a systematic advanced control strategy, in particular, model predictive control (MPC) to effectively and efficiently regulate this complex, multivariable process. In this thesis, the sedimentation-consolidation model is adopted and analysed to identify important dynamical features and the <b>key</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> which will be considered in control system design. The model is then validated using industrial plant data. An extended Kalman filter is developed to estimate in real-time the <b>key</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> which affects thickening dynamics significantly. Through extensive simulation studies, it has been demonstrated that the proposed MPC approach can deliver a higher underflow solids concentration and a better regulated underflow removal rate. In addition to the basic MPC, several important extensions are developed based on three practical considerations. Firstly, it is illustrated that incorporating ``future'' time-varying constraints in the MPC can help deal with the control difficulty arising from the co-disposal of underflow and coarse reject, leading to improved control performance. Secondly, an MPC with a non-uniformly spaced optimisation horizon is proposed to deal with the timescale multiplicity of thickening. The proposed approach provides similar levels of performance as compared to a conventional MPC with the advantage of reduced computational complexity. A stability ensuring condition for the proposed MPC is also developed. Thirdly, an MPC is developed to control both underflow solids concentration and rake torque. The nonlinear rake torque control problem is converted into a linear MPC problem, reducing the computational complexity of the optimisation problem. Simulation {{studies have shown that the}} proposed approach can effectively control the underflow solids concentration while minimising the rake torque, potentially preventing serious operational problems such as underflow blockage...|$|E

The effect of H 2 -plasma pretreatment on the diameter of grown CNTs was investigated. We found that the average diameter of CNTs could be easily controlled by using the H 2 -plasma pretreatment time before CNTs growth and varied from 36 nm to 26 nm as the pretreatment time changed from 5 min to 15 min. However, any further increase in the pretreatment time {{gave rise to a}} rapid decrease in CNTs growth. After 25 min of the plasma pretreatment, scanning electron microscopy observation exhibited the destruction of the CNTs. The impact of the plasma pretreatment time on the emis-sion behavior of CNTs was also investigated in a diode-type electron-emission configuration. The variation of the CNT diameter due to the plasma pretreatment caused a drastic change in emission properties. The turn-on voltages of CNT emitters varied from 3. 5 V/µm to 9 V/µm, depending on the hydrogen-plasma pretreatment conditions. The close relationship between the electron-emission characteristics and the pretreatment time indicates that the pretreatment condition may be a <b>key</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> in CNTs growth for field-emission displays and should be optimized.

40|$|The most {{critical}} concern in circuit {{is to achieve}} high level of performance with very tight power constraint. As the high performance circuits moved beyond 45 nm technology {{one of the major}} issues is the parameter variation i. e. deviation in process, temperature and voltage (PVT) values from nominal specifications. A <b>key</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> subject to variation is the transistor threshold voltage (Vth) which impacts two important parameters: frequency and leakage power. Although the degradation can be compensated by the worstcase scenario based over-design approach, it induces remarkable power and performance overhead which is undesirable in tightly constrained designs. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is a more power efficient approach, however its coarse granularity implies difficulty in handling fine grained variations. These factors have contributed to the growing interest in power aware robust circuit design. We propose a variability compensation architecture with adaptive body bias, for low power applications using 28 nm FDSOI technology. The basic approach is based on a dynamic prediction and prevention of possible circuit timing errors. In our proposal we are using a Canary logic technique that enables the typical-case design. The body bias generation is based on a DLL type method which uses an external reference generator and voltage controlled delay line (VCDL) to generate the forward body bias (FBB) control signals. The adaptive technique is used for dynamic detection and correction of path failures in digital designs due to PVT variations. Instead of tuning the supply voltage, the key idea of the design approach is to tune the body bias voltage bymonitoring the error rate during operation. The FBB increases operating speed with an overhead in leakage power...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{wafer bonding}} {{has emerged as}} an {{important}} technology {{in the manufacture of}} silicon-on-insulator substrates (SOI), microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and three-dimensional integrated circuits (3 D IC's). While the process is currently employed in applications such as these, a lack of knowledge of the basic mechanics of the process has made developing robust processes and preventing process failures extremely challenging. The current work addresses this problem through the development and validation of mechanics-based models that connect the wafer geometry, etch pattern, clamping configuration, and work of adhesion to bonding failure. An energy-based bonding criterion, which allows the effect of flatness variations and etch patterns to be quantified, is presented and employed to develop analytical and numerical models. Analytical models, based on plate theory, are developed to examine the role of wafer-scale shape variations, etch patterns, and the clamping configuration. Finite element models are developed to verify the analytical models and to evaluate the bonding criterion for wafers with anisotropic elastic properties and arbitrary geometries. Experiments in which silicon substrates with wafer-scale shape variations and etch patterns were bonded demonstrate that the shape and size of the bonded area and the shape of the bonded pair can be predicted using the models developed. The effect of mid-spatial wavelength height variations (nanotopography) on bonding is examined through a combination of modeling and experiments. The experiments and analysis provide a route for characterizing nanotopography and assessing its impact on bonding. The accuracy of the wafer bonded double cantilever beam, which(cont.) is one method to evaluate the <b>key</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> of interface toughness, is also examined in the current work.

30|$|A <b>key</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> {{which affects}} the glycosidase-catalyzed {{synthesis}} is the water {{activity of the}} reaction medium; a sufficiently high water activity (aw[*]=[*] 0.6) is required by glycosidases to retain activity. This is unlike lipases which can be active at water activity close to zero [71]. However, a high water content promotes hydrolysis thus decreasing the overall product concentration. The yield in kinetically controlled reactions depends on the concentration of water and other competing nucleophiles like alcohols and the selectivity of the enzyme. Large alcohols need higher water activity to be active as glycosyl acceptors compared to the small ones as this increases {{the flexibility of the}} active site for accommodating the large nucleophiles. The optimal water activity has been determined for different chain length alcohols and indicated water activity (aw) of 0.43, 0.71 and 0.81 for propanol, hexanol and octanol respectively [16]. An optimal water activity of 0.67 was also reported for XAD- 4 immobilized β-glucosidase for octyl-β-D-glucoside synthesis [71]. An elaborate study on five different glycosidase-catalyzed transglycosylation reactions in hexanol showed that the best conditions for transglycosylation were higher water activity but without a separate aqueous phase and for all the enzymes the selectivity for alcohol increased with an increase in water activity [16]. In the reverse hydrolysis mode, a decrease in water activity resulted in an increase in equilibrium yield of hexyl glucoside but {{this was not the case}} in the kinetically controlled reaction wherein the ratio between transglucosylation and hydrolysis increased with an increase in water activity [72]. Since water activity and water content show close correlation, studies on the effect of water content in the organic reaction are of crucial significance. Effect of water content (5 - 30 %, v/v) on the ratio of transglycosylation rate to hydrolysis rate (rT/rH) has been studied during the synthesis of hexyl glucoside and octyl glucoside using p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) and methyl glucoside as donors respectively. For hexyl glucoside synthesis, a ratio of rT/rH of 5.1 at 16 % water content was found to be optimum and a maximum ratio of rT/rH 2.28 at 8 % water content was optimum for octyl glucoside synthesis. Above this optimum water content, a drastic decrease in rT/rH was observed possibly because of mass transfer limitation of pNPG or methyl glucoside from organic to aqueous phase [24, 66]. Thus, for every enzyme/cell system, the conditions need to be optimized.|$|E
40|$|Low cost NMR sensor for {{measuring}} moisture content of forest products. The Department of Energy (DOE) Industries of the Future (IOF) program seeks {{development and implementation}} of technologies that make industry more efficient [...] in particular, more energy-efficient. Quantum Magnetics, Inc. (QM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GE Security, received an award under the program to investigate roles for low-cost Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technology in furtherance of these goals. Most NMR systems are designed for high-resolution spectroscopy applications. These systems use intense magnetic fields produced by superconducting magnets that drive price and operating cost to levels beyond industry tolerance. At low magnetic fields, achievable at low cost, one loses the ability to obtain spectroscopic information. However, measuring the time constants associated with the NMR signal, called NMR relaxometry, gives indications of chemical and physical states of interest to process control and optimization. It was the purpose of this effort to investigate the technical and economic feasibility of using such low-field, low-cost NMR to monitor parameters enabling greater process efficiencies. The primary target industry identified in the Cooperative Development Agreement was the wood industry, where the moisture content of wood is a <b>key</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> from the time the cut tree enters a mill until the time it is delivered as pieces of lumber. Extracting the moisture is energy consuming, and improvements in drying efficiency stand to reduce costs and emissions substantially. QM designed and developed a new, low-cost NMR instrument suitable for inspecting lumber up to 3 inches by 12 inches in cross section, and other materials of similar size. Low cost is achieved via an inexpensive, permanent magnet and low-cost NMR spectrometer electronics. Laboratory testing demonstrated that the NMR system is capable of accurate ({+-} 0. 5 %) measurements of the moisture content of wood for moisture ranging from 2 % to over 140 % (referenced to the wood's dry weight). Accuracy exceeded that offered by existing instrumentation when the moisture content was in excess of the fiber saturation point ({approx} 20 %). Accuracy was independent of the wood form: solid wood, wood chips or sawdust. The prototype NMR system was designed and built for incorporation and use in a beta test site. Beta testing is under way at the pilot plant operated by the Pulp and Paper Research Institute of Canada (PAPRICAN) in Vancouver, B. C. Other industries were also investigated. For example, laboratory testing demonstrated that low-field NMR is capable of measuring the hydrogen content of calcium oxide (quicklime). Hydrogen content measurement can be done both rapidly (on the order of 1 second) and nondestructively. Measurement of moisture in quicklime affects energy consumption in the steel industry. Further advances in system electronics, ongoing under DOD support, will enable yet more substantial system cost reductions over the prototype system, opening up a wider range of utility...|$|E
40|$|Wood-plastic {{composites}} (WPC) as {{a result}} of their ability to be produced from a wide range of materials and mixtures of different materials, including recycled materials and materials hithertosent to waste disposal, have become an area of increasing interest worldwide. Recent changes to environmental legislation mandating higher recycling targets have created additional interest. WPC material is currently used in the manufacture of a number of indoor and outdoor products, but these products are limited to profiles that have uniform cross section due to a lack of suitable post-production processes. The feasibility of producing three-dimensional wood thermoplastic composite products in a novel post-production process using extruded WPC profiles in a press forming method and the effect of temperature on this process are studied in this thesis. The aim of this work was to investigate and characterize the effect of temperature as the key parameter in the shaping process and to improve forming quality by regulating the process temperature based on the material characteristics. Experiments undertaken included primary tests to investigate the feasibility of the post-extrusion shaping process using a press forming method and tests to establish the key factors determining the forming process of the thermoplastic WPC sheet. In these tests, the forming quality of the samples was investigated based on material characteristics such as variation in thickness, surface roughness and fiber direction. Preliminary forming tests revealed the importance of temperature as the <b>key</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameter.</b> A diverse set of related tests including cooling rate measurements, flexural tests, tensile tests, conveyor surface energy measurements and numerical simulation were conducted to ascertain material behavior in the shaping process with the aim of improving the forming process. The results showed that the proposed shaping process is feasible and forming can be done in an uninsulated WPC post-production line. The cooling rate is a key factor in the process and needs to be considered carefully in order to find the right time for the pressing process. Additionally, the cooling rate sets limits on the slowest web speed attainable. Predominant fiber orientation also affects the forming result. The samples produced were accurate with respect to geometrical shape and deformation of the product after cooling. Material variation of the primary extruded WPC sheet affected the quality of the final product; however, the shaping process improved the quality of the material, i. e., resulted in reduced surface roughness and thickness variation. Material behavior under pressing forces needs to be considered during design of the forming tools. Numerical simulation was performed using an elasto-visco-plastic material model and the simulation results were in good agreement with experimental values, indicating the feasibility of using a simulation approach for preliminary evaluation of the formability of different WPCs based on their material characteristics. At elevated temperatures, the studied WPC material showed more ductile behavior and a change in ultimate tensile strain. At higher strain rate, increasing the temperature increased the ultimate strain capacity significantly, whereas at lower strain rate, increasing the temperature decreased the ultimate strain capacity of the material...|$|E

The objective of the present work is to model a pilot installation that should be built in the next few months. This pilot installation will be retrofitted in an existing coal-fired power plant in order to treat 5000 Nm³/h flue gas in two process trains. It is planed that 90 % of the CO 2 present in the flue gas can be removed, which corresponds to a capture rate of about 1 ton CO 2 /h. The role of this simulation is to facilitate the comprehension of the capture phenomena and to highlight the <b>key</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameter</b> and their influence on the obtained results. Furthermore, some technical improvements are studied that aim at a reduction of the energy consumption of the CO 2 -capture process. The simulation tool Aspen Plus has been employed to model the pilot installation. It has been assumed for the simulation requirement that the equilibrium state was achieved for each stage of the mass transfer columns. Mass transfer limitations and reaction kinetics have then been neglected. The model described in this work has been successfully developed for one process train treating a flue gas flow of 2500 Nm³/h. The solvent is monoethanolamine (MEA), which is the most employed solvent in CO 2 -capture technologies. The CO 2 -recovery rate has been fixed to 90 %. The most relevant process parameter that have been studied with the developed model are the solvent flow rate, the solvent concentration, and the stripper pressure. An optimum for the solvent flow rate has been identified at 11, 75 m³/h, corresponding to a thermal energy consumption of 3, 76 GJ/ton CO 2. When increasing the stripper pressure, the thermal energy consumption decreased up to 16 %. The fact that a pressure increase in the stripper leads to a temperature increase and the strong temperature dependence of the CO 2 -partial pressure explained this reduction of the thermal energy consumption. However, an increase of the stripper pressure induces solvent degradation problems, corrosion and a more complex equipment design. The MEA-concentration has been varied between 27 and 37 wt-%. When using a more concentrated solvent solution, the solvent is easier to regenerate. Consequently, the thermal energy consumption of the process decreased up to 12, 5 %. However, corrosion problems limit the use of concentrated solvents so that the MEA-concentration in capture-processes is generally adjusted to 30 wt-%. Furthermore, two process modifications have been tested successfully. First, a partial evaporation of the regenerated solvent after the stripper outlet has been studied. The gaseous product of this partial evaporation was compressed and recycled to the stripper. A decrease by 25 % of the thermal energy consumption could be achieved. However, compression work has to be furnished. When calculating the improvement on the basis of exergy, then the exergy of the capture process decreased by 18 %. The second modification that has been studied is a solvent intercooling between two absorber stages. It has been observed that intercalating the intercooler between absorber bottom stages gives better results than between absorber top stages. Simulation results have shown that the thermal energy consumption decreased by up to 6 %. In the case of a flue gas pre-cooling before the absorber inlet, about the same reduction of the thermal energy requirement could be achieved. Finally, a thermal energy consumption of 2, 82 GJ/ton CO 2 has been achieved in the best case, corresponding to a process exergy reduction by approximately 18 %. The developed model allows further improvements so that the optimization of the CO 2 -capture process could be pursued. Since a detailed study of the process model could help the planning of an experimental test phase, the test-campaigns with the new pilot plant could be optimized...|$|E

It is extensively {{applied in the}} electronic, automobile, military and aviation industries. As a new material manufacturing technology, twin-roll casting not only produces the strip directly, but also improves magnesium alloy properties. Some important <b>process</b> <b>parameters</b> in twin-roll casting are difficult to be obtained in the experiment can be acquired using the numerical simulation. In this study, the two finite element models are established, which classify as submerged and non-submerged ones according to the nozzle types. Inverse method {{was used to determine}} the boundary conditions between the roll and molten pool. The influences of <b>key</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameters</b> including the rolling speed, pouring temperature, submerged nozzle depth and nozzle spray angle are discussed and compared for different cases. The coupling of temperature-flow-thermal stress fields has been carried out in this study. Increasingly casting speed and pouring temperature, the higher strip outlet temperature and uniform temperature distribution can be observed in non-submerged models. Submerged nozzle depth change has a significantly influence on the outlet temperature destitution than the varied nozzle spray angles in submerged models. Furthermore, the raised temperature at outlet decreases the thermal stress of strip. It can avoid thermal cracks generated on the surface to improve the casting strip quality of magnesium alloy. The suitable <b>key</b> <b>process</b> <b>parameters</b> are obtained from the simulation data analysis...|$|R
