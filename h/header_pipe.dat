It is suggested that engineers responsible for constructing new skating arenas or replacing existing brine headers in refrigeration systems use this new energy-efficient technology. ...|$|R
5000|$|When the {{descending}} piston first {{exposes the}} exhaust port on the cylinder wall, the exhaust flows out powerfully {{due to its}} pressure (without assistance from the expansion chamber) so the diameter/area over {{the length of the}} first portion of the pipe is constant or near constant with a divergence of 0 to 2 degrees which preserves wave energy. This section of the system is called the [...] "header pipe" [...] (the exhaust port length is considered part of the <b>header</b> <b>pipe</b> for measurement purposes). By keeping the <b>header</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter near constant, the energy in the wave is preserved because there is no expansion until needed later in the cycle. The flow leaving the cylinder during most of the blowdown process is sonic or supersonic, and therefore no wave could travel back into the cylinder against that flow.|$|E

The US government has offered excess fissile {{material that is}} no longer needed for defense purposes for International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection. Measurement results provided by the CHEM were used by the IAEA in a verification experiment to provide confidence that the US successfully blended excess highly enriched uranium (HEU) down to low enriched uranium (LEU). The CHEM measured the uranium enrichment in two cascade <b>header</b> <b>pipes,</b> a 20. 32 -cm HEU pipe and a 7. 62 -cm product LEU pipe.

The ratio yields the enrichment. The CHEM consists of a collimator assembly, an electromechanically cooled germanium detector, and a rack-mounted personal computer running commercial and custom software. The CHEM was installed in December 1997 and was used by the IAEA inspectors for announced and unannounced inspections on the HEU and LEU <b>header</b> <b>pipes</b> through October 1998.

The KLX 450R is essentially a KX450F open-class motocross bike with added convenience features that make it more suitable for trail riding, green laning, enduro events and lower speed riding in general. This {{is due to the}} larger gas tank, 18 inch rear wheel, headlamp and even electric start.

Some of this is achieved by less aggressive engine internals and the [...] "low boy" [...] exhaust <b>header</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E
50|$|Combined {{with the}} {{acoustic}} wave {{there is a}} general rise in pressure in the chamber caused by deliberately restricting the outlet with a small tube called the stinger, which acts as a bleeder, emptying the chamber during the compression/power stroke to have it ready for the next cycle. The stinger's length and inside diameter are based on 0.59 to 0.63x the <b>header</b> <b>pipe</b> diameter and its length is equal to 12 times its diameter, depending on the results to be achieved. In a well designed tuned exhaust system, the total increase in pressure is in any case much less than the one produced by a muffler. An erroneous sizing of the stinger will lead either to poor performance (too big or too short) or to excessive heat (too small or too long) which will damage the engine.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is useful}} {{to keep in mind}} that {{although}} the waves traverse the entire expansion chamber over each cycle, the actual gases leaving the cylinder during a particular cycle do not. The gas flows and stops intermittently and the wave continues on to the end of the pipe. The hot gases leaving the port form a [...] "slug" [...] which fills the <b>header</b> <b>pipe</b> and remains there for the duration of that cycle. This causes a high temperature zone in the head pipe which is always filled with the most recent and hottest gas. Because this area is hotter, the speed of sound and thus the speed of the waves that travel through it are increased. During the next cycle that slug of gas will be pushed down the pipe by the next slug to occupy the next zone and so on. The volume this [...] "slug" [...] occupies constantly varies according to throttle position and engine speed. It is only the wave energy itself that traverses the whole pipe during a single cycle. The actual gas leaving the pipe during a particular cycle was created two or three cycles earlier. (This is why exhaust gas sampling on two stroke engines is done with a special valve right in the exhaust port. The gas exiting the stinger has had too much resident time and mixing with gas from other cycles causing errors in analysis.) ...|$|E

5000|$|Switching from an exhaust {{manifold}} to exhaust headers (also known as extractors in Australia) will optimize the {{exhaust gas flow}} speed and in turn increase the high-end power of the engine. This is done by using an individual pipe for each exhaust port that has smoother bends with a larger turn radius, decreasing airflow resistance, {{as well as a}} calculated pipe diameter to obtain a good scavenging effect for the specific engine capacity. The pipes then merge into a collector and then flow into a larger pipe (down pipe), just before the catalytic converter. With equal length headers, as each exhaust valve in the head of the engine is opened and exhaust gas is forced out, it passes down one of the header pipes and through to the down pipe, where the exhaust gas velocity causes a slight vacuum in another <b>header</b> <b>pipe.</b> This has an effect of scavenging exhaust gas from the cylinder, which is beneficial for performance. In performance engines, which have cam overlap, the scavenging effect will pull air through from the intake manifold as well, further increasing performance. The length of exhaust headers can be tuned to perform best at specific RPM ranges. Stock {{exhaust manifold}}s are usually made of cast iron and can be restrictive. Headers may or may not increase the dB level of the exhaust, depending on the original exhaust manifold it replaces and the engine. However, the pipes do [...] "ring" [...] with the exhaust pulses and increase underhood noise. Headers can be ceramic coated to reduce the heat radiated in the engine compartment, and to increase the temperature of the pipes which increases the velocity of the exhaust gases.|$|E

50|$|The unique {{feature that}} gave the 1989 and onward models their Exup name (for Exhaust Ultimate Power Valve) was Yamaha's {{four-stroke}} power valve system, a servo motor-driven exhaust valve.

It gave pulling power from low revs, seamlessly, up to the red line at 11,500 rpm. It also allowed extremely radical high lift cams that gave a very lumpy idle when unplugged {{in the open position}} or when using a full aftermarket exhaust. Yamaha used this valve system on the YZF models which followed (Thunderace) and the R1 models from 1998.|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an estimate of}} the leak rate from the emergency pump well in L-basin that is to be expected during an off-normal event. This estimate is based on expected shrinkage of the engineered grout (i. e., controlled low strength material) used to fill the emergency pump well and the <b>header</b> <b>pipes</b> that provide the dominant leak path from the basin to the lower levels of the L-Area Complex. The estimate will be used to provide input into the operating safety basis to ensure that the water level in the basin will remain above a certain minimum level. The minimum basin water level is specified to ensure adequate shielding for personnel and maintain the ''as low as reasonably achievable'' concept of radiological exposure. The need for the leak rate estimation is the existence of a gap between the fill material and the <b>header</b> <b>pipes,</b> which penetrate the basin wall and would be the primary leak path {{in the event of a}} breach in those pipes. The gap between the pipe and fill material was estimated based on a full scale demonstration pour that was performed and examined. Leak tests were performed on full scale pipes as a part of this examination. Leak rates were measured to be on the order of 0. 01 gallons/minute for completely filled pipe (vertically positioned) and 0. 25 gallons/minute for partially filled pipe (horizontally positioned). This measurement was for water at 16 feet head pressure and with minimal corrosion or biofilm present.

40|$|This {{quarterly}} report documents significant achievements in the Enhanced Practical Photosynthetic CO{sub 2 } Mitigation project {{during the period}} from 4 / 2 / 2001 through 7 / 01 / 2002. Most of the achievements are milestones in our efforts to complete the tasks and subtasks that constitute the project objectives, and we are currently on schedule to complete Phase I activities by 10 / 2002, the milestone date from the original project timeline. As indicated in the list of accomplishments below, our efforts are focused on improving the design of the bioreactor test system, evaluating candidate organisms and growth surfaces, and scaling-up the test facilities from bench scale to pilot scale. Specific results and accomplishments for the second quarter of 2002 include: Organisms and Growth Surfaces: (1) Our collection of cyanobacteria, isolated in YNP was increased to 15 unialgal cultures. (2) Illumination rate about 50 {micro}E/m{sup 2 }/sec is not saturated for the growth of 1. 2 s. c. (2) isolate. The decrease of illumination rate led to the decrease of doubling time of this isolate. (3) The positive effect of Ca{sup 2 +} on the growth of isolate 1. 2 s. c. (2) without Omnisil was revealed, though Ca{sup 2 +} addition was indifferent for the growth of this isolate at the presence of Omnisil. (4) Calcium addition had a positive effect on the generation of cyanobacterial biofilm on Omnisil surface. (5) The survivability problems with the Tr 9. 4 organism on Omnisil screens in the CRF 2 model-scale bioreactor have been solved. The problems were related to the method used to populate the growth surfaces. When pre-populated screens were placed in the bioreactor the microalgae died within 72 hours, but when the microalgae were cultured while in place in the bioreactor using a continuous-population method they grew well inside of the CRF 2 test system and survived for the full 7 -day test duration. CRF 2 tests will continue as soon as the new combined drip system/harvesting system <b>header</b> <b>pipe</b> design is refined. Bioreactor support systems and test facilities: (1) A solar collector, fiber optic light cables, and 8 light distribution panels have been installed at the pilot-scale bioreactor site. The ''natural'' lighting system is ready for the pilot-scale bioreactor system-level debugging tests scheduled for early to mid July. (2) CO{sub 2 } scrubbing tests were carried out to understand the CO{sub 2 } scrubbing capability of translating slug flow under various conditions. Within experimental error, for liquid velocities of 0. 6 m/s and 1 m/s it was shown that different gas velocities (including 4. 8, 6. 6 and 9 m/s) cause no significant change in CO{sub 2 } concentration. (3) The harvesting tests were put on hold while an alternative loading method was developed and to concentrate our resources on the design of the new combined drip system/harvesting system <b>header</b> <b>pipe.</b> A new <b>header</b> <b>pipe</b> design has been completed and proof-of-concept tests have shown good performance in the drip loading mode. Tests have also shown that we can create preferable conditions for harvesting with this design, and actual harvesting tests will be run as soon as screens are available that have achieved a sufficiently ''thick'' growth state such that harvesting is desired...|$|E
40|$|High {{acoustic}} energy {{is known to}} cause vibrations in pipes, and in some severe cases acoustic induced vibration can lead to fatigue failure at branch connections with high stress concentration. Industry guidelines suggest using mitigation measures such as fabricated full wrap-around reinforcement pad (re-pad) or Sweepolet fittings at branch connections. Effectiveness of these mitigation measures is evaluated via a finite element analysis of four types of branch connections; (i) Sockolet, (ii) Sockolet with 2 ” wide partial re-pad, (iii) Sockolet with full wrap-around re-pad, and (iv) Sweepolet. Four distinct acoustic frequency ranges (1 / 3 octave bands) with associated sound pressure levels are used as the excitation source. Maximum stress levels in the main <b>header</b> <b>pipe</b> at the branch tie-in are monitored to assess the potential for vibration damage. Of the four branch connections, Sockolet with full wrap-around re-pad {{is found to be}} least susceptible to damage, followed by the Sweepolet.

40|$|Multi-evaporator vapor {{compression}} systems (ME-VCS) simultaneously provide cooling {{to multiple}} zones. The thermodynamic conditions in these zones are independent: the heat loads often differ, and {{the occupants of}} these spaces often have different desired room temperatures. Therefore, in order to regulate each zone to its desired setpoint temperature, the amount of thermal energy removed by each evaporator must be modulated independently. However, the common evaporating pressure within all evaporators introduces coupling that makes this objective difficult [...] -the valve and piping arrangement imposes the constraint that all evaporators operate at the same temperature. (Systems considered here do not have valves at the outlet of each evaporator and therefore the individual evaporator pressures cannot be independently controlled.) In {{order to reduce the}} per-zone cooling, existing control strategies duty cycle the evaporator (alternate between a fully-open and fully-closed valve). However, duty cycling causes periodic disturbances to not only the local zone, but also to many machine temperatures and pressures, and these disturbances are often not transient but instead persist indefinitely. Fluctuations induced by the periodic disturbances can degrade the ability of the machine to regulate zone temperatures with zero steady state error, cause excessively high or low temperatures during peaks of the period, and couple into most machine signals of interest in ways that are difficult to describe with low order dynamical models. As an alternative to duty cycling, an observed behavior of refrigerant mass distribution in multi-path heat exchangers is exploited for control purposes. Multi-path heat exchangers are characterized by an inlet <b>header</b> <b>pipe</b> that splits refrigerant flow to two or more parallel paths through the heat exchanger and collects those paths into a common outlet <b>header</b> <b>pipe.</b> In the paper, we describe the following empirical phenomenon exploited for control: as the inlet valve is decreased, refrigerant mass flow rate entering the heat exchanger is reduced, and at some critical flow rate, refrigerant is shown to preferentially flow in some paths more than others, causing maldistribution. This uneven refrigerant distribution is repeatable and reduces the capacity in a continuous manner. The refrigerant distribution can be detected by temperature sensors along different paths of a multi-path heat exchanger. As some paths are starved for refrigerant they become superheated, and this uneven superheating process is unstable. A feedback controller is designed to provide stability and robustness to per-zone conditions. Finally, setpoints for this controller that relate per-path superheat temperature to overall evaporator capacity is created {{in such a way as}} to be robust to changes in local zone temperatures and the overall system evaporating temperature, which provides zone decoupling and ultimately creates a virtual control input for a supervisory controller such as a model predictive controller...|$|E

Fluctuation of demand also results in alternation of such operation results in thermal gradient. Both the above mentioned situation leads to hold time fatigue kind of situation. P 92 (9 Cr- 1 Mo- 2 W) martensitic steel is widely used for the manufacturing of header pipes and is subjected to creep-fatigue loading condition. The aim behind the present study is to verify an existing unified viscoplasticity constitutive model, proposed by Choboche. This model includes combined isotropic hardening and kinematic hardening with a viscoplastic flow rule for time-dependent effects.

40|$|What is aeration? Aeration {{is a step}} in {{wastewater}} treatment where air is added to wastewater for mixing purposes and to enhance biological growth. The purpose of aeration is to dissolve oxygen into wastewater so that the microorganisms can utilize it while they break down organic material. What is fine bubble aeration? Fine bubble aeration is a subsurface form of diffusion in which air is introduced in the form of very small bubbles to aid or enhance the treatment of wastewater. Air flows from a pipe into diffusers located {{at the bottom of a}} tank. These diffusers have numerous small openings (known as pores) through which air flows into the wastewater in the tank. In the past, various diffusion devices have been classified as either fine bubble or coarse bubble based on how efficiently they transferred oxygen to the wastewater. Since it is difficult to clearly distinguish between fine and coarse bubbles, diffused aeration systems have been classified based on the physical characteristics of the equipment. In a fine bubble aeration system, several diffusers are mounted or screwed into a <b>header</b> <b>pipe</b> that may run along the length or width of the tank or on a short manifold mounted on a movable pipe. These diffusers come in various shapes and sizes, such as discs, tubes, domes, and plates. The common types of coarse bubble diffusers are fixed orifices, valved orifices, and static tubes. The bubble size of these diffusers is larger than the porous diffusers, thus, lowering the oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE). Fine pore diffusers (discs, tubes, domes, and plates) are usually made from ceramic, plastic, or flexible perforated membranes. Although many materials can be used to make fine pore diffusers, only these few are being used due to cost considerations, specific characteristics, market size, and other factors.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the essential elements}} of the cryogenic system. The cryogenic distribution system starts {{at the level of}} the linac superconducting RF cavities [1] and moves out through the cryogenic piping to the liquid helium refrigeration plant that will be used to cool the RF cavities and the undulator magnets. For this report, the cryogenic distribution system and cryogenic refrigerator includes the following elements: (1) The piping within the linac cryogenic modules will influence the heat transfer through the super-fluid helium from the outer surface of the TESLA niobium cavity and the liquid to gas interface within the horizontal <b>header</b> <b>pipe</b> where the superfluid helium boils. This piping determines the final design of the linac cryogenic module. (2) The acceptable pressure drops determine the supply and return piping dimensions. (3) The helium distribution system is determined by the need to cool down and warm up the various elements in the light source. (4) The size of the cryogenic plant is determined by the heat loads and the probable margin of error on those heat loads. Since the final heat loads are determined by the acceleration gradient in the cavities, a linac with five cryogenic modules will be compared to a linac with only four cryogenic modules. The design assumes that all cryogenic elements in the facility will be cooled using a common cryogenic plant. To minimize vibration effects on the beam lines, this plant is assumed to be located some distance from the synchrotron light beam lines. All of the cryogenic elements in the facility will be attached to the helium refrigeration system through cryogenic transfer lines. The largest single cryogenic load is the main linac, which consists of four or five cryogenic modules depending on the design gradient for the cavities in the linac section. The second largest heat load comes from the cryogenic modules that contain the transverse deflecting RF cavities. The injector linac is the third largest heat load. The seven superconducting undulator magnets in the hard x-ray production section are the smallest heat loads connected to the light source refrigeration plant. The linac and deflecting cavity sections require helium cooling at 1. 9 K, 5 K and 40 K. The undulator magnets require two-phase helium cooling at 4. 3 to 4. 5 K...|$|E

Most of the time, each exhaust port on the heads has its own individual pipe, but in the case of turbocharged engines the four pipes on each side of the engine block converge into one single header which then lead into one of the two turbochargers, as Pro Mod engines are almost exclusively charged by one turbocharger on each side of the motor (one turbocharger for each four cylinders), resulting in two exhaust pipes instead of eight.|$|R
