5|$|Keisha Castle-Hughes was Randall's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Sunni based on her {{performance}} in the New Zealand film Whale Rider (2002). Castle-Hughes agreed to star in the film when she <b>first</b> <b>read</b> the script at age 13, but was 16 by the time finance had been raised and filming began. Castle-Hughes' pregnancy was announced shortly before production was scheduled to begin but filming went ahead unaffected. Toni Collette was confirmed to have joined the cast in May 2006; her scenes were filmed over one week.|$|E

Mary McDonagh Murphy interviewed celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Rosanne Cash, Tom Brokaw, and Harper's sister Alice Lee, who read the novel and compiled their impressions of it as children and adults into a book titled Scout, Atticus, and Boo.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, {{which he}} had <b>first</b> <b>read</b> in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of the}} book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E
5|$|Lurie's script {{received}} a rewrite by Pamela Pettler, {{who worked with}} Burton on Corpse Bride, but the director hired Big Fish screenwriter John August in December 2003 to start from scratch. Both August and Burton were fans of the book since their childhoods. August <b>first</b> <b>read</b> Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when he was eight years old, and subsequently sent Dahl a fan letter. He {{did not see the}} 1971 film prior to his hiring, which Burton believed would be fundamental in having August stay closer to the book. The writer updated the Mike Teavee character into an obsessive video game player, as compared to the novel, in which he fantasized about violent crime films. The characters Arthur Slugworth and Prodnose were reduced to brief cameo appearances, while Mr. Beauregarde was entirely omitted.|$|E
5|$|Stroheim {{was known}} to exaggerate events from his life and create myths about himself, such as his fictitious aristocratic origins and {{military}} record in Austria. He claimed that shortly after having moved to the US in the early 1910s, {{he had found a}} copy of McTeague in a motel in New York and had read it in one sitting. He also said that wanting to adapt the book inspired him to make a career in filmmaking. Georges Sadoul later stated that Stroheim had <b>first</b> <b>read</b> the novel in 1914, while living in poverty in Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|When Skerritt <b>first</b> <b>read</b> the {{screenplay}} for Alien, he declined the project, unimpressed with its writing quality and budget. After {{the screenplay}} was edited {{and the budget}} enlarged, Skerritt was approached again and signed on. Halfway through production, he approached writer and executive producer Ronald Shusett {{and asked if he}} could trade his salary for a one-half percentage point (.5 percent) share in the film. In a deleted scene, Ellen Ripley detours while escaping from the Nostromo and finds Dallas alive in the Alien nest; she kills Dallas and destroys the nest with a flamethrower in an act of mercy. According to Skerritt, the scene was cut because its quality was below par and it disrupted the pace of Ripley's escape; it was included in the 2003 director's cut.|$|E
5|$|With {{the piece}} {{set to open}} on 26 December, Gilbert <b>first</b> <b>read</b> the {{libretto}} to the cast on 14 December, but Toole, who was playing {{the central role of}} Thespis, did not return from a tour of the British provinces until 18 December. He then appeared in nine performances at the Gaiety in the six days immediately after his return, and other actors had similar commitments. In addition, Hollingshead had committed the company to perform a pantomime at The Crystal Palace on 21 December, which included many of the performers who would be in Thespis. Lastly, Thespis was to play as the afterpiece to an H. J. Byron comedy, Dearer than Life, which shared many of its actors, including Toole and Fred Sullivan, and had to be rehearsed at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Actress Jennifer Ehle {{was chosen}} out {{of half a}} dozen serious {{candidates}} to play Elizabeth, the second Bennet daughter, the brightest girl, and her father's favourite. At the time in her mid-20s, Ehle had <b>first</b> <b>read</b> Pride and Prejudice at the age of 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule. Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted Colin Firth, a relatively unknown British actor in his mid-30s at the time, to play the wealthy and aloof Mr. Darcy. Birtwistle had worked with him on the mid-1980s comedy film Dutch Girls, but he repeatedly turned down her offer as he neither felt attracted to Austen's feminine perspective nor believed himself to be right for the role. Birtwistle's persistent coaxing and his deeper looks into the Darcy character finally convinced him to accept the role. Firth and Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which only received media attention after the couple's separation.|$|E

5|$|Publisher Jamie Byng of Canongate Books {{solicited}} author Margaret Atwood {{to write}} a novella re-telling a classic myth of her choice. Byng explained it would be published simultaneously in several languages {{as part of an}} international project called the Canongate Myth Series. Atwood agreed to help the rising young publisher by participating in the project. From her home in Toronto, the 64-year-old author made attempts at writing the Norse creation myth and a Native American story but struggled. After speaking with her British literary agent about canceling her contract, Atwood began thinking about the Odyssey. She had <b>first</b> <b>read</b> it as a teenager and remembered finding the imagery of Penelope's twelve maids being hanged in the denouement disturbing. Atwood believed the roles of Penelope and her maids during Odysseus' absence had been a largely neglected scholarly topic and that she could help address it with this project.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{increased}} use of early agreements in the EU co-decision procedure raises the concern that intra and inter-institutional political debate is sacrificed {{for the sake of}} efficiency. We investigate the effect of early agreements (trilogues) on the time it takes for legislation to be negotiated during the <b>first</b> <b>reading</b> of co-decision. We find that the <b>first</b> <b>reading</b> negotiations of trilogues on salient legislation take longer than first readings of similar files reconciled at second and third <b>reading.</b> <b>First</b> readings of early agreements also appear to last longer when considering all co-decision files submitted to the 5 th and 6 th European Parliaments, but the effect is masked by a general increase in <b>first</b> <b>reading</b> duration after 2004. We conclude that even if early agreements restrict access of certain actors to decision making, they allow for more time for substantive debate at the <b>first</b> <b>reading</b> stage than similar files reconciled later in the legislative process...|$|R
