5000|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>plates</b> can be {{classified}} by the workshops that made them. Attic fishplates were manufactured in the Kerameikos district of Athens, Greece; Apulian <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> were manufactured in various workshops in Taranto (Taras) on the [...] "heel of the boot" [...] of Italy; Campanian <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> come from {{the region of the}} Bay of Naples, Italy (There were fabrics in both Capua and Cumae (Kyme)); Paestan fabrics were made in Paestum (Poseidonia), south of Salerno, Italy (These are the only <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> signed by the artists, coming from the workshops of Python and Asteas.). <b>Fish</b> <b>plates</b> were made in almost all South Italian ceramic fabrics except for those in Lucania (on the Gulf of Taranto, the [...] "arch of the boot" [...] of Italy).

5000|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>plates</b> {{were first}} {{produced}} in Athens {{during the late}} fifth century BC. These Attic <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> are characterized by fish whose bellies are oriented towards the outside rim of the plate. In Athens the palette was restricted to red clay fabric and black gloss slip with rare uses of white overpainting. Later, Italiote Greek settlers in Southern Italy began to mass-produce more colorful <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> in Taranto (Greek [...] "Taras"), Paestum (Greek [...] "Poseidonia"), Capua (Etruscan [...] "Capue"), and Cumae (Greek [...] "Kyme"). The South Italian <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> are characterized by decoration in which the fish's bellies are oriented towards the sauce cup {{at the center of}} the plate.|$|R

40|$|Stocks Reservoir is {{situated}} amidst the Forest of Bowland {{in the upper}} reaches of the old river valley of the Hodder. The reservoir was built in 1927 for the Fylde Water Board who primarily supplied water to Blackpool. The objective of this study is to assess the degree and likelihood of fish ingress onto the <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> at the present and proposed stocking densities. An additional aim is to evaluate the operational implications, and if necessary suggest methods of alleviating the problem. Three spheres of study have been undertaken to achieve these objectives, these being: 1. To selectively stock the reservoir and monitor the angling club catches in order to assess the total population, relating it to <b>fish</b> <b>plate</b> losses and proposed stocking densities. 2. To monitor the fish taken from the <b>fish</b> <b>plates</b> and assess the reasons for their ingress. 3. To study the draw off tower and <b>fish</b> <b>plates,</b> and suggest ways of ameliorating or halting the loss of fish and consequent operational problems...|$|R

In most cases, approximately 50  % of structural strength {{at ambient temperature}} is retained at temperatures up to 390  °F [200  °C].

40|$|Public Power District was {{not able}} to fully inspect 50 % of the core <b>plate</b> rim {{hold-down}} <b>bolts</b> at Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) in accordance with BWRVIP- 25 (Reference). BWRVIP- 25 requires that 50 % of the core <b>plate</b> rim hold-down <b>bolts</b> of BWR/ 2 - 5 plants without repair wedges be examined by enhanced VT- 1 from below the core plate (or by UT from above core plate once the technique is developed). However, it was determined that the bolts cannot be inspected by UT due to configuration issues and it has recently been concluded that an EVT- 1 exam does not provide meaningful results. Accordingly, a technical justification for deviation from the BWRVIP guidance was developed. The technical justification demonstrates that the core <b>plate</b> <b>bolts</b> have a relatively low susceptibility to cracking based on field experience and fabrication practices. In addition, should cracking occur in some bolts, the consequences are mitigated by redundancy in the bolting and associated alignment hardware. Finally, even with the extremely conservative assumptions of failures of both the bolting and the redundant hardware, the Standby Liquid Control system could be used to bring the reactor to a safe shutdown. The BWRVIP is currently working on developing revised guidance for the core <b>plate</b> <b>bolts</b> an...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{system of}} a steel <b>plate</b> <b>bolted</b> to a Reinforced Concrete (RC) shear wall {{goes by the}} name of a ‘Composite Steel Plate Shear Wall’ (CSPSW), which is used as the lateral {{resisting}} system in tall buildings. In this system, the steel plate buckles under medium-strong earthquakes, which may lead to instability. However, the buckling load of steel plates is usually a limited criterion for the design of CSPSW. This paper reports a series of experiments on CSPSW. The experiments were used to investigate the buckling load of a steel <b>plate</b> <b>bolted</b> to one side of a high strength reinforced concrete panel. Furthermore, theoretical modeling, based on energy methods, was used to obtain the elastic buckling coefficients of steel plates with various aspect ratios under shear loading. The results were presented in graphical and tabular forms showing good agreement of theoretical modeling with experimental results. The elastic buckling coefficients can be used for determination of the number of bolts or the spacing between the bolts...|$|R
