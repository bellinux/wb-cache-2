30|$|The {{networks}} we {{are dealing}} with in this work are made of contributions (media content) on a topic linked by inter-references (e.g. hyperlinks). Chains of those references denote different information pathways. Furthermore, each contribution carries a timestamp which corresponds to the time when it was published. Thus, information pathways (or <b>diffusion</b> <b>cascades)</b> can also described in a temporal dimension with regard to the speed of diffusion. The position of a node (contribution) in an information diffusion network is thereby defined by the paths on which it can be reached in which time and the paths other nodes can be reached in a certain period in time. To model positions, modifications of the Katz centrality measure (Katz 1953) can be used to quantify the influence of contributions with respect to how many nodes can be reached and the time this takes (Hecking et al. 2018).|$|R

40|$|Social {{networks}} readily transmit information, {{albeit with}} less than perfect fidelity. We present a large-scale measurement of this imperfect information copying mechanism by examining the dissemination and evolution of thousands of memes, collectively replicated {{hundreds of millions of}} times in the online social network Facebook. The information undergoes an evolutionary process that exhibits several regularities. A meme’s mutation rate characterizes the population distribution of its variants, in accordance with the Yule process. Variants further apart in the <b>diffusion</b> <b>cascade</b> have greater edit distance, as would be expected in an iterative, imperfect replication process. Some text sequences can confer a replicative advantage; these sequences are abundant and transfer “laterally ” between different memes. Subpopula-tions of the social network can preferentially transmit a specific variant of a meme if the variant matches their beliefs or culture. Understanding the mechanism driving change in diffusing information has im-portant implications for how we interpret and harness the information that reaches us through our social networks...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAnalyzing and {{modeling}} the temporal diffusion {{of information on}} social media has mainly been treated as a diffusion process on known graphs or proximity structures. The underlying phenomenon results however from the interactions of several actors and media and {{is more complex than}} what these models can account for and cannot be explained using such limiting assumptions. We introduce here a new approach to this problem whose goal is to learn a mapping of the observed temporal dynamic onto a continuous space. Nodes participating to <b>diffusion</b> <b>cascades</b> are projected in a latent representation space {{in such a way that}} information diffusion can be modeled efficiently using a heat diffusion process. This amounts to learning a diffusion kernel for which the proximity of nodes in the projection space reflects the proximity of their infection time in cascades. The proposed approach possesses several unique characteristics compared to existing ones. Since its parameters are directly learned from cascade samples without requiring any additional information, it does not rely on any pre-existing diffusion structure. Because the solution to the diffusion equation can be expressed in a closed form in the projection space, the inference time for predicting the diffusion of a new piece of information is greatly reduced compared to discrete models. Experiments and comparisons with baselines and alternative models have been performed on both synthetic networks and real datasets. They show the effectiveness of the proposed method both in terms of prediction quality and of inference speed...|$|R
40|$|Many of the world’s {{most popular}} {{websites}} catalyze their growth through invitations from existing members. Newmembers can then in turn issue invitations, and so on, creating cascades of member signups that can spread {{on a global}} scale. Although these diffu-sive invitation processes are critical to the popularity and growth of many websites, they have rarely been studied, and their properties remain elusive. For instance, {{it is not known}} how viral these cas-cades structures are, how cascades grow over time, or how diffusive growth affects the resulting distribution of member characteristics present on the site. In this paper, we study the diffusion of LinkedIn, an online pro-fessional network comprising over 332 million members, a large fraction of whom joined the site as part of a signup cascade. First we analyze the structural patterns of these signup cascades, and find them to be qualitatively different from previously studied in-formation <b>diffusion</b> <b>cascades.</b> We also examine how signup cas-cades grow over time, and observe that diffusion via invitations on LinkedIn occurs over much longer timescales than are typically as-sociated with other types of online diffusion. Finally, we connect the cascade structures with rich individual-level attribute data to investigate the interplay between the two. Using novel techniques to study the role of homophily in diffusion, we find striking dif-ferences between the local, edge-wise homophily and the global, cascade-level homophily we observe in our data, suggesting that signup cascades form surprisingly coherent groups of members...|$|R

We examined time-stamped signature data from the Obama White House's We the People petition platform. We developed measures based on temporal dynamics that, we argue, can be used to infer diffusion structure as well as the more intrinsic notion of virality sometimes known as infectiousness. These measures indicate that successful petitions are likely to be higher in both intrinsic and structural virality than unsuccessful petitions are. We also investigate threshold effects on petition signing that challenge simple contagion models, and report simulations for a theoretical model that are consistent with our data.

40|$|AbstractWith {{increasing}} computing power, Large Eddy Simulation {{could be}} a useful simulation tool for gas turbine axial compressor design. This paper outlines a series of simulations performed on compressor geometries, ranging from a Controlled <b>Diffusion</b> <b>Cascade</b> stator blade to the periodic sector of a stage in a 3. 5 stage axial compressor. The simulation results show that LES may offer advantages over traditional RANS methods when off-design conditions are considered – flow regimes where RANS models often fail to converge. The time-dependent nature of LES permits the resolution of transient flow structures, and can elucidate new mechanisms of vorticity generation on blade surfaces. It is shown that accurate LES is heavily reliant on both the near-wall mesh fidelity {{and the ability of}} the imposed inflow condition to recreate the conditions found in the reference experiment. For components embedded in a compressor this requires the generation of turbulence fluctuations at the inlet plane. A recycling method is developed that improves the quality of the flow in a single stage calculation of an axial compressor, and indicates that future developments in both the recycling technique and computing power will bring simulations of axial compressors within reach of industry in the coming years...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{investigation}} of mid-span local boundary layer suction and positive bowed cascade, a coupled local tailored boundary layer suction and positive bowed blade method is developed to improve {{the performance of a}} highly loaded <b>diffusion</b> <b>cascade</b> with less suction slot. The effectiveness of the coupled method under different inlet boundary layers is also investigated. Results show that mid-span local boundary layer suction can effectively remove trailing edge separation, but deteriorate the flow fields near the endwall. The positive bowed cascade is beneficial for reducing open corner separation, but is detrimental to mid-span flow fields. The coupled method can further improve the performance and flow field of the cascade. The mid-span trailing edge separation and open corner separation are eliminated. Compared with linear cascade with suction, the coupled method reduces overall loss of the cascade by 31. 4 % at most. The mid-span loss of the cascade decreases as the suction coefficient increases, but increases as bow angle increases. The endwall loss increases as the suction coefficient increases. By contrast, the endwall loss decreases significantly as the bow angle increases. The endwall loss of coupled controlled cascade is higher than that of bowed cascade with the same bow angle because of the spanwise inverse “C” shaped static pressure distribution. Under different inlet boundary layer conditions, the coupled method can also improve the cascade effectively...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{surgical}} innovation frameworks {{suffer from}} a unifying limitation, their qualitative nature. A rigorous approach to measuring surgical innovation is needed that extends beyond detecting simply publication, citation, and patent counts and instead uncovers an implementation-based value from {{the structure of the}} entire adoption cascades produced over time by diffusion processes. Based on the principles of evidence-based medicine and existing surgical regulatory frameworks, the surgical innovation funnel is described. This illustrates the different stages through which innovation in surgery typically progresses. The aim is to propose a novel and quantitative network-based framework that will permit modeling and visualizing innovation <b>diffusion</b> <b>cascades</b> in surgery and measuring virality and value of innovations. Network analysis of constructed citation networks of all articles concerned with robotic surgery (n = 13, 240, Scopus®) was performed (1974 - 2014). The virality of each cascade was measured as was innovation value (measured by the innovation index) derived from the evidence-based stage occupied by the corresponding seed article in the surgical innovation funnel. The network-based surgical innovation metrics were also validated against real world big data (National Inpatient Sample-NIS®). Rankings of surgical innovation across specialties by cascade size and structural virality (structural depth and width) were found to correlate closely with the ranking by innovation value (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = 0. 758 (p = 0. 01), 0. 782 (p = 0. 008), 0. 624 (p = 0. 05), respectively) which in turn matches the ranking based on real world big data from the NIS® (Spearman's coefficient = 0. 673;p = 0. 033). Network analysis offers unique new opportunities for understanding, modeling and measuring surgical innovation, and ultimately for assessing and comparing generative value between different specialties. The novel surgical innovation metrics developed may prove valuable especially in guiding policy makers, funding bodies, surgeons, and healthcare providers in the current climate of competing national priorities for investment...|$|R
40|$|Two of {{the main}} {{frameworks}} used for modeling information diffusions in the online are epidemic models and Hawkes point processes. The former consider information as a viral contagion which spreads into a population of online users, and employ tools initially developed {{in the field of}} epidemiology. The latter view individual broadcasts of information as events in a point process and they modulate the event rate according to observed (or assumed) social principles; they have been broadly used in fields such as finance and geophysics. Here, we study {{for the first time the}} connection between these two mature frameworks, and we find them to be equivalent. More precisely, the rate of events in the Hawkes model is identical to the rate of new infections in the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model when taking the expectation over recovery events [...] which are unobserved in a Hawkes process. This paves the way to apply tools developed for one framework across the gap, to the other framework. We make three further contributions in this work. First, we propose HawkesN, an extension of the basic Hawkes model, in which we introduce the notion of finite maximum number of events that can occur. Second, we show HawkesN to explain real retweet cascades better than the current state-of-the-art Hawkes modeling. The size of the population can be learned while observing the cascade, at the expense of requiring larger amounts of training data. Third, we employ an SIR method based on Markov chains for computing the final size distribution for a partially observed cascade fitted with HawkesN. We propose an explanation to the generally perceived randomness of online popularity: the final size distribution for real <b>diffusion</b> <b>cascades</b> tends to have two maxima, one corresponding to large cascade sizes and another one around zero...|$|R
