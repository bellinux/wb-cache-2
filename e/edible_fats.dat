5000|$|As for {{the meaning}} of [...] "Aqlivusta," [...] Rashi has {{explained}} as being the small bone lying on that bone which, French, is called hanche (haunch or hip), and {{is connected to the}} vertebrae of the tail the sheep. But Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi explained as that bone which holds fast all the other bones, while the Kol Bo has written Rashi's explanation under his name. Yet, the known as Sefer Mitzvot Gedolot (Hasemag) has written under the prohibitive command # 138, Tarba de-Aqlivusta: Rashi has explained the Qaliboseth (i.e. tail bone) as being the small bone lying on that bone which is called French hanche (haunch or hip), and is connected to the vertebrae of the tail the sheep from above, upon which there is suet beneath the loin, and which is among that suet found on the flanks.Now these are the words used by Rabbi A. of Meitze: [...] "Near the tail can be found the <b>edible</b> <b>fat</b> of the sheep's tail, upon which is the suet of the Qaliboseth (i.e. tail bone), and that same suet and <b>edible</b> <b>fat</b> of the sheep's tail cling one to another, etc." [...] But in book Sheiltot of Rabbi Ahai Gaon, and in book Halachot Gedolot, they have written: [...] "The suet which is upon the flanks is the suet of the Qaliboseth (i.e. tail bone), where the hind legs attach themselves." [...] Likewise has Maimonides, of blessed memory, written: [...] "is the suet which is at the joints of the hind legs from within." [...] Yet, in book Sefer Hazikkaron, he explained Tarba de-Aqlivusta as the place where the thighs are attached, etc., while in an Arabic commentary on the laws governing Ritual Slaughter find that Qaliboseth means [...] "al-falakh." ...|$|R

40|$|Arrested {{coalescence}} is an unique instability {{observed in}} oil-in-water emulsions. It occurs when droplets begin the coalescence process but then stop at an intermediate state {{because of some}} resistance, usually rheological, in origin. Emulsions with arrested structures can either aid or harm product quality {{depending on whether the}} resultant structures enhance or disrupt product aesthetics. Past work has examined doublets, two same-sized droplets forming a stable arrested structure, but this thesis extends that work to consider differences in size, the behaviour of greater numbers of droplets in arrested structures, and the effects of <b>edible</b> <b>fat</b> crystallization on arrest. The first part of this project evaluates the effect of droplet size on the final deformation of the resulting doublet. An increase in size of droplets caused less deformation, and a decrease in size caused high deformation, because of the resulting curvature differences. When doublets form from two different sized-droplets they form a less compact structure than equivalent mono-disperse droplets because of differences in surface area. Addition of a third droplet to doublets can cause rearrangement of the newly-added droplet if the liquid meniscus bridge overlaps with one of the existing droplets. Restructuring is shown to produce more compact shapes but only occurs for systems with sufficiently low internal elasticity and when the approach angle is low. In the second part, microstructures formed by larger numbers of arrested droplets in a bulk emulsion were studied, to evaluate whether the mechanisms of structure formation by doublets and triplets is broadly valid. Important differences occur when flow dominates, as rotation and restructuring can occur, as can larger droplet deformation because of inertial effects, resulting in more compact structures. The final part applies the current model to more complex <b>edible</b> <b>fat</b> systems: coconut oil, goose fat and duck fat. In these systems heterogeneity of the crystallization causes coalescence and arrest to be much more variable and irregular than in the model systems previously studied. Different locations of the crystals in droplets can trigger or prevent coalescence...|$|R

50|$|The {{determination}} of trace acids in organic matrices {{is a common}} analytical task assigned to titrimetry.

The sample is dissolved in a suitable solvent mixture; say a hydrocarbon and an alcohol which also must contain {{a small amount of}} water. The water is intended to enhance the electrical conductivity of the solution. The trace acids are titrated with standard base in an alcohol. The sample environment is essentially hostile to the pH electrode used to sense the titration.
