50|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the weak interaction is its violation of parity symmetry.

40|$|The {{ground states}} of double-charm <b>hyperons</b> form a spin 1 / 2 isospin 1 / 2 multiplet {{analogous}} {{to that of}} nucleons. Their main strong interaction may be inferred directly from the corresponding nucleon-nucleon interaction by multiplication of the interaction components by the appropriate fractional difference between interaction strengths for pairs of light flavor quarks and pairs of triplets, e. g. nucleons, of light flavor quarks. By construction {{of the interaction between}} the recently discovered double-charm <b>hyperons</b> by this method from several realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction models it is shown that double-charm <b>hyperons</b> are likely to form bound (or possibly meta-stable) states akin to the deuteron in the spin triplet state. Double beauty baryons would form corresponding deeply bound states. Nucleons and double charm (beauty) <b>hyperons</b> will also form bound states.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the emergence of}} <b>hyperons</b> in black-hole-forming failed supernovae, which are caused by the dynamical collapse of nonrotating massive stars. We perform neutrino-radiation hydrodynamical simulations in general relativity adopting realistic hyperonic equation-of-state (EOS). Attractive and repulsive cases are examined for the potential of Σ <b>hyperons.</b> Since <b>hyperons</b> soften the EOS, they shorten the time interval from the bounce to black hole formation, which corresponds to the duration of neutrino emission. This effect is larger for the attractive case than the repulsive case because Σ <b>hyperons</b> appear more easily. In addition, we {{investigate the}} impacts of pions to find that they also promotes the recollapse towards the black hole formation.

40|$|AbstractWe {{calculate}} the magnetic moments of <b>hyperons</b> in dense nuclear matter by using relativistic quark models. <b>Hyperons</b> {{are treated as}} MIT bags, and the interactions {{are considered to be}} mediated by the exchange of scalar and vector mesons which are approximated as mean fields. Model dependence is investigated by using the quark–meson coupling model and the modified quark–meson coupling model; in the former the bag constant is independent of density and in the latter it depends on density. Both models give us the magnitudes of the magnetic moments increasing with density for most octet baryons. But there is a considerable model dependence in the values of the magnetic moments in dense medium. The magnetic moments at the nuclear saturation density calculated by the quark–meson coupling model are only a few percents larger than those in free space, but the magnetic moments from the modified quark–meson coupling model increase more than 10 % for most <b>hyperons.</b> The correlations between the bag radius of <b>hyperons</b> and the magnetic moments of <b>hyperons</b> in dense matter are discussed...|$|R
