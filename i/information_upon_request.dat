40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} enabling charging for composed services comprised of services offered by multiple providers. In the framework rating engines may generate charge information for individual services and provide this <b>information</b> <b>upon</b> <b>request</b> to other rating engines when these services {{are used as}} part of a composed service. Rating engines additionally employ a two-phase rating process which allows potentially complex business agreements between providers to be reflected in composed service charges.

Crucially, the process allows rating engines to calculate these varying charges without having to be manually pre-configured with details of the structure of individual composed services.

40|$|Tax {{authorities}} are increasingly relying on mutual cooperation with their foreign peers to enforce more effectively their internal tax laws. After the banking scandals of 2008 {{and the subsequent}} global financial crisis, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for TaxPurposes has proposed the exchange of <b>information</b> <b>upon</b> <b>request</b> as the fiscal transparency standard. However, some measures adopted by the European Union, previous initiatives from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and, above all, {{the introduction of the}} Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca) by the United States in 2010 have promoted the need to adopt the automatic exchange of information as the new fiscal transparency standard. Automatic exchange of information allows home countries to verify whether their taxpayers have correctly included foreign income, allowing tax authorities to have early warning of possible noncompliance cases.

40|$|In a {{tracking}} system, {{an object}} of interest is monitored continuously in a sensor network. Information about the object is kept in the sensors and sensors transmit the <b>information</b> <b>upon</b> <b>request.</b> In this paper, we consider the scenario where all sensors around a targeted object capture images of it and these pictures {{will be sent to}} a mobile agent upon request. Due to the size and energy limitations in sensors, images kept in sensors are often small and highly compressed. We describe a framework to facilitate a mobile agent in the sensor network to request images of the object of interest. As sensors are limited in energy, it is desirable to reduce the energy used in transmitting the images. We observe that, in a sensor network that is sufficiently dense, images from neighbor cameras would likely overlap, and therefore intermediate sensors can process and combine overlapping portions so as to reduce the energy spent on image transmission. We develop a protocol for involved sensors to determine how to transmit the images they have kept to the mobile agent in an energy efficient manner. Our protocol is truly distributed and does not require any global information. We evaluate our protocol through extensive simulations. </p...|$|E
40|$|The core {{idea behind}} TapReference {{is to help}} users promote their work {{experience}} and showcase the impact they had upon their fellow co-workers, bosses, managers etc. through a medium that makes gathering that information fast and simple. To achieve this, users must first register themselves to create a personal account which then produces a profile page for that specific user.

The user who owns the profile can then choose whether or not to allow a referral that has been sent to them, to be displayed on their profile page. This is to prevent bogus or malicious “referrals” from appearing on their profile. To give potential employers a better idea of what kind of perspective this user’s talents are being viewed from, users who submit referrals will have their current area of employment displayed next to their referral. This will help give other users an idea of what kind of position this person has in the organization which they work for such as the position of CEO, a manager or a developer.

40|$|Study of the {{dephasing}} {{in electronic}} systems {{is not only}} important for probing {{the nature of their}} ground states, but also crucial to harnessing the quantum coherence for information processing. In contrast to well-studied conventional metals and semiconductors, it remains unclear which mechanism is mainly responsible for electron dephasing in three-dimensional (3 D) topological insulators (TIs). Here, we report on using weak antilocalization effect to measure the dephasing rates in highly tunable (Bi,Sb) $_ 2 $Te$_ 3 $ thin films. As the transport is varied from a bulk-conducting regime to surface-dominant transport, the dephasing rate is observed to evolve from a linear temperature dependence to a sublinear power-law dependence. While the former is consistent with the Nyquist electron-electron interactions commonly seen in ordinary 2 D systems, the latter leads to enhanced electron dephasing at low temperatures and is attributed to the coupling between the surface states and the localized charge puddles in the bulk of 3 D TIs.

40|$|Cross-border {{tax evasion}} {{has emerged in}} recent years as a central issue in tax enforcement. Traditionally, the legal regime {{governing}} cross-border tax enforcement was based on <b>information</b> exchange <b>upon</b> <b>request.</b> In 2010, the US Congress enacted the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which seeks to induce foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to participate in a global regime of automatic information reporting of the income of US residents to the US government. This paper presents a simple theoretical model of cross-border investment that analyzes the consequences of this (unilateral) FATCA regime. The model emphasizes cross-border investors 2 ̆ 019 (heterogeneous) intrinsic motivation to comply with tax law, as well as the impact of information reporting requirements on the cost of providing financial services. In FATCA-compliant equilibria (in which FFIs report information to the US government) FFIs face a higher cost of providing financial services, increasing the fees charged to their accountholders. Consequently, tax-compliant behavior 2 ̆ 013 such as investing via their domestic financial sector 2 ̆ 013 becomes more costly for foreign residents. Under certain conditions, a unilateral FATCA regime causes increased cross-border tax evasion among residents of foreign countries. This result is robust to various extensions...|$|R
