50|$|The Arcopal brand was {{introduced}} in 1958. This fully tempered glassware is high-strength and durable, break and chip resistant. Although very thin, Arcopal glass is five times stronger than china. Arcopal tableware was famous for its translucent opal borosilicate glass. In 1986 the Arcopal ranges of products were included in Luminarc and Arcoroc offers, under the ranges of products made in Opal. The Arcopal France tableware is microwave and <b>dishwasher</b> <b>safe.</b> Arcopal bakeware is oven, microwave, and <b>dishwasher</b> <b>safe.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Unlike wood, most plastic {{boards are}} non-porous, {{which means that}} {{bacteria}} can't enter below the surface. It is still equally as important to clean the boards thoroughly after each use as bacteria can lie and grow in any imperfections on the surface. Although many boards are <b>dishwasher</b> <b>safe,</b> both domestic and professional boards which are HDPE will be [...] by the hot water, making them unsafe. When heavily or deeply scored, boards need to be resurfaced as scoring can harbour mildew and bacteria. However, resurfacing a plastic cutting board is quite difficult and replacing it is recommended instead.|$|E
50|$|Higher-quality {{stainless}} steel pressure cookers {{are made with}} heavy, three-layer, or copper-clad bottoms (heat spreader) for uniform heating because {{stainless steel}} has lower thermal conductivity. Most modern stainless steel cookers are <b>dishwasher</b> <b>safe,</b> although some manufacturers may recommend washing by hand. Some pressure cookers have a non-stick interior.A gasket or sealing ring, made from either rubber or silicone, forms a gas-tight seal that does not allow air or steam to escape between the lid and pan. Normally, the only way steam can escape is through a regulator on the lid while the cooker is pressurized. If the regulator becomes blocked, a safety valve provides a backup escape route for steam.|$|E

50|$|Deba bōchō (出刃包丁, literally: pointed carving knife) are Japanese style kitchen carvers {{primarily}} used to cut fish, though {{also used}} when cutting meat. They come in different sizes, sometimes up to 30 cm (12 inches) in length. The deba bōchō first {{appeared during the}} Edo period in Sakai. It is designed to behead and fillet fish. Its thickness, and often a more obtuse angle {{on the back of}} the heel allow it to cut off the heads of fish without damage. The rest of the blade is then used to ride against the fish bones, separating the fillet. Traditionally, these are made of carbon steel, which needs regular maintenance and oiling to prevent rust. However, many modern knives are also available as stainless steel, which may be <b>dishwasher</b> <b>safe.</b> The carbon steel blades, however, can be sharpened into a sharper cutting edge.|$|E

40|$|Polypropylene is in a {{category}} of thermoplastic polymer resin. It {{is a part of}} both the average household and is in commercial and industrial applications. This plastic is regularly used for food containers because it needs to be <b>dishwasher</b> <b>safe.</b> Although the thermoforming process has been developed for over two decades but there are still some unsolved problems found in this technology. In the development commercial polypropylene grades, there are several critical problems addressed such as sheet quality, part uniformity and wall thickness, regrind use and dimensional stability. This project starts with searching various types of journal that related to the topic of designing and fabricating thermoplastic container using polypropylene (PP) sheet via thermoforming process. Read and understand all the journals are the element in the effort to make this project. This study aims to design and fabricate plastic container using polypropylene (PP) sheet with thickness 1 mm via thermoforming process. CATIA P 3 V 5 R 21 software by Dassault Systemes was used to design the plastic container and its mould. Design consideration for the plastic product and its mould is important as to reduce the defects. For example fillet was added to avoid sharp edge. Draft angle also was used at the wall side of mould which is to ease the process of absorption. Round shape plastic container was selected to be design as it has smooth shape that allows the pliable polypropylene sheet to form according to the shape of the mould. An aluminum block with dimension 100 mm x 100 mm x 50 mm was used as the female cavity been cut using band saw machine. The aluminum blocks was machined using Makino KE 55 CNC Milling Machine located at the Machining Laboratory. High Speed Drilling machine was used to drill the hole {{at the bottom of the}} female mould. 1 mm and 6 mm diameter of drill bits was used to make the holes at the bottom of aluminum mould. Moreover, this project studies the effect of thermoforming temperature and number of mould vent hole to 1 mm PP sheet. Two types of vent holes used on the aluminum mould which are 1 vent and 5 vent holes. There were two parameters used to fabricate polypropylene plastic container. The first parameter is the different degree of temperature used to heat the 1 mm polypropylene plastic sheet. The degree of temperature used is 160 °C, 165 °C, 170 °C, and 175 °C. The second parameter that was used is different number of vent holes on the mould to fabricate the plastic container. The first one is 1 hole and secondly 5 holes, both ways was used same diameter of the vent hole which is 1 mm. Lastly the process to investigate the hardness property on the fabricated polypropylene plastic container was conducted using the Vickers Micro Hardness Tester to obtained the hardness value. Lowest value of HV range shows that the polypropylene plastic containers have uniform hardness. Based on the research conducted, the appearance of polypropylene plastic container at temperature 165 °C for 5 vent holes on mould almost goods compare to others temperature used. The appearance for other temperature was showed some defects such like wrinkles and overheated...|$|E
