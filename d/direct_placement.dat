As was suggested in the introduction, force <b>directed</b> <b>placement</b> is generally applicable to many layout problems, of which graph drawing is perhaps one of the simplest.

40|$|We {{describe}} a heuristic method for drawing graphs {{which uses a}} multilevel technique combined with a force <b>directed</b> <b>placement</b> algorithm. The multilevel process groups vertices to form clusters, uses the clusters to define a new graph and is repeated until the graph size falls below some threshold. The coarsest graph is then given an initial layout and the layout is successively optimised on all the graphs starting with the coarsest and ending with the original. In this way the multilevel algorithm both accelerates and gives a more global quality to the force <b>directed</b> <b>placement.</b> The algorithm can compute both 2 & 3 dimensional layouts and we demonstrate it {{on a number of}} examples ranging from 500 to 100, 000 vertices. It is also very fast and can compute a layout in around 30 seconds for a 10, 000 vertex graph to around 10 - 20 minutes for the larger graphs.

40|$|Abstract — Personal {{communication}} devices {{are increasingly being}} equipped with sensors {{that are able to}} passively collect information from their surroundings – information that could be stored in fairly small local caches. We envision a system in which users of such devices use their collective sensing, storage, and communication resources to query the state of (possibly remote) neighborhoods. The goal of such a system is to achieve the highest query success ratio using the least communication overhead (power). We show that the use of Data Centric Storage (DCS), or <b>directed</b> <b>placement,</b> is a viable approach for achieving this goal, but only when the underlying network is well connected. Alternatively, we propose, amorphous placement, in which sensory samples are cached locally and informed exchanges of cached samples is used to diffuse the sensory data throughout the whole network. In handling queries, the local cache is searched first for potential answers. If unsuccessful, the query is forwarded to one or more direct neighbors for answers. This technique leverages node mobility and caching capabilities to avoid the multi-hop communication overhead of <b>directed</b> <b>placement.</b> Using a simplified mobility model, we provide analytical lower and upper bounds on the ability of amorphous placement to achieve uniform field coverage in one and two dimensions.

5000|$|On 19 January Serbs {{defeated}} the defending European champions Croatia with 12:15 (2:2, 4:6, 3:3, 3:4) {{in a third}} round game and made a decisive step towards <b>direct</b> <b>placement</b> in the semifinals. At first it seemed all sports, Serbs responded after Croats scored {{three times in a}} row. Joković - Aleksić, Sukno - Nikić and Sukno - Udovičić were the scorers before the Serbian defense team came on the scene with masterful goalkeeper Soro and counterattacks. First Filipović scored a master lob, after which Prlainović made a precise, quick turnaround for 5:3. After Frano Karač dropped the result with a five-meter penalty, another counter was fatal for the Croats when Udovičić took his team to the lead of 6:4. 32-year-old Karač from Zagreb, reduced the advantage {{for the second time in}} a row, but then Stefan Mitrović in a situation with a player more, with a two-meter dribbling pushed the ball into the opponents net for 7:5. Then Udovičić appeared on the scene with a great spin-dribbling and hitting the net for the third time. Tumultuous first half ended with Joković realizing a situation with two players more and making the final score 8:5. In the third quarter, Duško Pijetlović and Miloš Ćuk took the advantage of a player more a rased the result to 10:6. Ivan Buljubašić interrupted a large series of [...] "dolphins" [...] with his first goal in a match, after which Sukno managed to score a goal and brake in to a half the [...] "-4" [...] backlog. However, Živko Gocić with his precise shot got the three-goal advantage back to his national team. After that, Miho Bošković precisely executed a five-meter penalty. The last quarter didn't go as [...] "dolphins" [...] had hoped. In Croats next attack, Mitrović was excluded and Sukno scored his fourth goal for 11:10. Mitrović made amends for his error and in the same minute took advantage of a two men more and knocked the ball into the net for 12:10. [...] "Dolphins" [...] new good defense allowed them a good offense, which gave them a new twist and a new goal - a great goal by D.Pijetlović, as well as Ćuk's masterful stroke in the next attack which increased the advantage to 14:10. When it became known who will rejoice, those who wouldn't, they began to rage. Dobud struck Filipović from behind who instantly got the bruising under his eye, but at the very next action he revenged with a hit. The final score was 15:12 for Serbia.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{technique}} to investigate the regeneration of utricular hair cells in the adult pigeon (Columba livia) following complete hair cell loss through administration of streptomycin. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental animal study. METHODS: Animals were divided into four groups. Group 1 received 10 to 15 days of systemic streptomycin injections. Animals in Groups 2 and 3 received a single <b>direct</b> <b>placement</b> of a 1 -, 2 -, 4 -, or 8 -mg streptomycin dose into the perilymphatic space. Animals in Groups 1 and 2 were analyzed within 1 week from injection to investigate hair cell destruction, whereas Group 3 was investigated at later dates to study hair cell recovery. Group 4 animals received a control injection of saline into the perilymphatic space. Damage and recovery were quantified by counting hair cells in isolated utricles using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Although systemic injections failed to reliably achieve complete utricular hair cell destruction, a single <b>direct</b> <b>placement</b> of a 2 -, 4 -, or 8 -mg streptomycin dose caused complete destruction within the first week. Incomplete hair cell loss was observed with the 1 -mg dose. Over the long term, regeneration of the hair cells was seen with the 2 -mg dose but not the 8 -mg dose. Control injections of saline into the perilymphatic space caused no measurable hair cell loss. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Direct</b> <b>placement</b> of streptomycin into the perilymph is an effective, reliable method for complete destruction of utricular hair cells while preserving the regenerative potential of the neuroepithelium...|$|E
