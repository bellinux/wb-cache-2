5|$|I did it {{deliberately}} {{and with}} all my power, because I felt that by nothing but the sacrifice of human life would the nation be brought to realise the horrible torture our women face!

5|$|I am {{completely}} {{at a loss}} in attempting to fathom the reasons why certain individuals and certain groups have now started a letter-writing campaign … to defeat the act. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> that if the letter writers would consult the facts, they would join with all others not only in hoping this act would become law but in working for its speedy passage and approval.|$|E
5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E

5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E
25|$|I {{never thought}} that I could win this tournament, but I don't know what I'm {{going to do in}} the future. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> I will play more both in Asia and Europe, but my {{ultimate}} target is to get onto the US Tour.|$|E
25|$|Oh <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> {{that there}} are Hamas members on the UNRWA payroll and I don't {{see that as a}} crime. Hamas as a {{political}} organization does not mean that every member is a militant and we do not do political vetting and exclude people from one persuasion as against another.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> {{that she}} was {{frequently}} bewildered by the rapidity and mutability of her own impulses. Possessed, as she was, of an intuitive rather than an analytical intelligence, I doubt that she really understood herself clearly, any more than did {{most of those who}} thought they knew her intimately. An exception in this regard was Daphne du Maurier.|$|E
25|$|Campo's blunder last Saturday was {{careless}} and costly. But {{few of the}} Australian {{players would}} be satisfied with their performances, including myself. Campo will hopefully learn by the mistake and the whole team, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure,</b> will not only show the tremendous spirit in Australian rugby but will improve on individual performances when matched against the might of New Zealand in August.|$|E
25|$|I {{am writing}} {{to ask you}} to {{consider}} the inclusion of my son, E. M.

It may interest you to learn that I have another son, now twelve years of age, who will in time be a much better player than his brother because his back stroke is sounder, and he always plays with a straight bat.|$|E

25|$|My heart...is {{to agree}} on all {{subjects}} with Charles Fox: but your opinions have been terribly at variance. New occurrences and change of circumstances will, I hope, bring us together again—but still I am anti-Gallican: I ask not, what sort of Government prevail, but under none, can I submit patiently to the strange assumption of power over independent nations, daily making by France. Here {{is the root of}} my present opinions: <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure,</b> it is the growth of good Whig soil.|$|E
25|$|Our apprehensions {{are raised}} by very {{different}} objects. You seem to dread {{the prevalence of}} Paine's opinions (which in most parts I detest {{as much as you}} do) while I am much more afraid of the total annihilation of all principles of liberty and resistance, an event which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> you would be as sorry to see as I. We both hate the two extremes equally, but we differ in opinions with respect to the quarter from which the danger is most pressing.|$|E
25|$|I {{suspect that}} I know {{more of the}} English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — I have talked to more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. Of this <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure,</b> that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E
6000|$|LADY CHILTERN. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> of it, Robert, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> of it. But {{why did you}} {{say those}} dreadful things, things so unlike your real self? Don’t let us ever talk about the subject again. You will write, won’t you, to Mrs. Cheveley, and tell her that you cannot support this scandalous scheme of hers? If you have given her any promise you must take it back, that is all! ...|$|R

25|$|If Campese wanted to, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> {{he could}} have sprinted for the corner and scored the try. Instead, he ran {{straight}} at Ackerman. The Welshman obviously knew enough about Campese to realise it was useless to try and tackle him front-on. Instead, he did what I suggested earlier that any defender should do against Campese – he ran with him. It was then that Campese began to zigzag, forcing Ackerman to zigzag, too, looking over one shoulder after another to see which way Campese was heading. I was following about 20 metres behind and could not believe what was happening. I {{have no doubt that}} Campese turned it on to make a personal point with Ackerman. When the defence eventually closed in on him, Campese flicked a pass over his shoulder to Michael Hawker, who scored the try.|$|E
25|$|On {{the door}} being opened it knocked against a table which {{was close to}} the {{left-hand}} side of the bedstead, and the bedstead was close against the wooden partition. The mutilated remains of a woman were lying two-thirds over, towards the edge of the bedstead, nearest the door. Deceased had only an under-linen garment upon her, and by subsequent examination <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> the body had been removed, after the injury which caused death, from that side of the bedstead which was nearest to the wooden partition previously mentioned. The large quantity of blood under the bedstead, the saturated condition of the palliasse, pillow, and sheet at the top corner of the bedstead nearest to the partition leads me {{to the conclusion that the}} severance of the right carotid artery, which was the immediate cause of death, was inflicted while the deceased was lying at the right side of the bedstead and her head and neck in the top right-hand corner".|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure,</b> agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E
