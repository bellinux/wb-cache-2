25|$|This {{sub-series}} of two 4-car sets {{was introduced}} on 17 April 2005 {{as part of}} the scheme to eliminate 103 series sets from the Kawagoe Line and Hachikō Line. Set number 71 consists of two former TWR 70-000 series control cars with two newly manufactured intermediate cars, while set number 72 consists entirely of former 70-000 series cars. The 70-000 series cars had become surplus when 6-car sets were reformed into 10-car sets in 2004. Like the 209-3000 series, these sets have passenger-operated <b>door</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|E
25|$|The center {{platform}} {{was first}} used in passenger service in 1959, but was originally built {{along with the other}} platforms. It served the purpose of a Spanish solution, allowing passengers to exit both sides of subway cars as the express trains would open the doors on both sides. Newer subway cars' <b>door</b> <b>controls</b> made it more difficult to open doors {{on both sides of the}} train simultaneously; thus this solution became impractical and the platform was closed on November 8, 1973. In 2007–2010, it was converted to a crossunder between the IRT side platforms. Large metal fences have been erected to keep people away from the edges.|$|E

By 2016 a third of stations are to have platform humps that reduce the step from platform to train. New trains, such as those being introduced on the sub-surface network, have access and room for wheelchairs, improved audio and visual information systems and accessible <b>door</b> <b>controls.</b>|$|E
2500|$|London Underground trains {{come in two}} sizes, larger sub-surface {{trains and}} smaller deep-tube trains. Since the early 1960s all {{passenger}} trains have been electric multiple units with sliding doors and a train last ran with a guard in 2000. [...] All lines use fixed length trains with between six and eight cars, except for the Waterloo & City line that uses four cars. New trains are designed for maximum number of standing passengers and for speed {{of access to the}} cars and have regenerative braking and public address systems. Since 1999 all new stock has had to comply with accessibility regulations that require such things as access and room for wheelchairs, and the size and location of <b>door</b> <b>controls.</b> All underground trains are required to comply with The Rail Vehicle Accessibility (Non Interoperable Rail System) Regulations 2010 (RVAR 2010) by 2020.|$|E
2500|$|The 1960 Stock trains ran {{mainly on}} the Hainault loop. Following limited trials on the District line {{of a system of}} Automatic Train Operation (ATO) in 1963, the lightly used Woodford to Hainault section of the Central line was used as a testing ground for full ATO in {{preparation}} for its use on the Victoria line. Five of the six 1960-stock trains were adapted at Acton Works. The side doors to the driver's cab were sealed, so that access was normally through the passenger saloon. Since the trains were to be operated by one person, the <b>door</b> <b>controls</b> were moved from the rear end of the motor car into the cab. The train control equipment was fitted beneath the centre seats, and consisted of a [...] "black box", which interpreted signals received from the running rails. These were picked up by sensing coils mounted on the leading bogie. One rail supplied safety information, which was received continuously. Any failure to obtain this data resulted in a trip-valve operating, which stopped the train. The second rail supplied signal commands, which included speed signals and instructions to start and stop the train. This information was only provided when it was needed. The driver was renamed a train operator, and was responsible for opening and closing the doors at stations, and initiating a start from the stations, by pressing two buttons simultaneously. All other operation, including stopping at signals and restarting when safe to proceed was automatic. The first automatic train entered service on 5 April 1964. The automatic control equipment was temporarily mounted in the passenger saloon, between the cab and the first set of doors, to enable engineers to monitor and adjust it as experience was gained.|$|E
50|$|The Class 614 has <b>door</b> <b>control</b> with {{selective}} <b>door</b> {{opening and}} door sensory systems. The doors, which on the 624/634 {{were not always}} easy to open, are assisted by compressed air. As part of modernisation in the mid-90s a warning tone device was retrofitted and - unlike the 624 - also an anti-jam system. Some of the vehicles also have warning lights {{in the area of the}} door. Shortly after the turn of the millennium several 614's were converted to TAV (technikbasierte Abfertigungsverfahren) automatic <b>door</b> operation. <b>Door</b> <b>control</b> computers were installed, door handles removed and replaced by door opening buttons and photoelectric beams. Because the new <b>door</b> <b>control</b> system was not very reliable and the vehicles were approaching the end of their service life the TAV installation programme was halted after a few years, even befhore the end of the remotoring programme.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{motivated}} by the possible benefits of a more precise trawl control system with respect to both environmental impact and fishing efficiency. It considers how the control performance of a pelagic trawl system can be improved, partly by introducing a control architecture tailor-made for the trawl system subject to industrial requirements, and partly by developing a trawl <b>door</b> <b>control</b> concept. A mathematical model of the trawl system is developed, including an accurate model of the hydrodynamic forces on the trawl doors. This model estimates both the steady state and the transient forces on trawl doors moving in six degrees of freedom. The steady state hydrodynamic forces are based on wind tunnel experiments. To estimate the transient forces, a software code based on potential theory is developed. This software estimates the time-dependency of the forces from circulation about the foil, the angular damping forces, and the forces from relative accelerations between the fluid and the trawl door. Various concepts for trawl <b>door</b> <b>control</b> are evaluated. This is done both analytically, by simulations and by towing tank experiments. Based on the results, a new trawl <b>door</b> <b>control</b> concept is proposed. The trawl <b>door</b> <b>control</b> concept is developed to fulfill the demands on both energy consumption, robustness and control performance. Because of the contradictory demands on performance, stability and energy efficiency, the control concept is improved using numerical optimization. The optimization is based on timedomain simulations of the trawl system. The design of an overall trawl control architecture {{taking advantage of the}} trawl <b>door</b> <b>control</b> system is presented. This takes industrial constraints into account, such as the energy supply on the trawl <b>doors.</b> The <b>control</b> system is based on model predictive control and facilitates complex objectives, constraints and process models. The use of model predictive control is made possible by letting PID plant controllers act as a layer between the model predictive controller and the trawl system. The model predictive controller is thus able to operate on a stable and predictable system with no fast dynamics. To reduce the energy consumption of the trawl <b>door,</b> conventional feedback <b>control</b> is avoided on this part of the control system, and step wise feedforward control is instead employed. The main contributions in this work are the mathematical modeling of the hydrodynamic forces on a trawl door, the design of a control architecture tailor-made for trawl system control and the method for optimization of the trawl <b>door</b> <b>control</b> concept. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
