There are several arguments for utilization of the hydrogen : high heat of combustion, zero CO(2) emission, etc. But there are also significant disadvantages : low density, high cost of production and safety problems.

40|$|In a small <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>discharge</b> gap, {{avalanches}} and streamers start ionization but do {{not produce}} gas heating or a conducting bright filamentary channel. The electron density is not high enough to promote the ion-electron interaction that leads to rapid neutral gas heating. Nevertheless, long after initial ionization has subsided in a gap, a very rapid transient stage is produced. This constitutes the spark proper and changes a weakly ionized cold gas into a hot, highly conducting luminous fluid. The spark stage may incorporate very rapidly moving luminous fronts, and depending on the power supply, {{may lead to a}} much cooler are discharge. It has been suggested many times that the spark transition can be associated with electron fluid behavior : For instance, using 2 mm long gaps we have shown that the initial ionization produces a long-lived high temperature, non-equipartition electron fluid, and that the propagation of fast luminous fronts can be associated with non-linear electron waves. 1 Here we present evidence to show that, under appropriate conditions, subsonic electron fluid behavior can also be exhibited.

40|$|Metal Halide (MH) lamps are <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>discharge</b> devices, {{containing}} a complex chemical mixture, to emit {{light on a}} broad spectrum while maintaining good efficacies. Lamps of this type were first exhibited by General Electric at the 1964 World Fair in New York [1]. They typically consist of an inner burner {{the size of a}} cigarette filter, surrounded by a larger protective outer wall. The inner burner is made from polycrystalline alumina or quartz and is filled with noble gasses, mercury (about 10 mg) and salt additives (a few milligram). Under operating conditions the inner burner has a gas pressure of several tens of atmospheres, most of which is mercury vapor. The salt additives, such as sodium, scandium and dysprosium idide, are present in very low concentrations in the gas phase. Yet it is these minority species that provide most of the light output. A well known [2, 3, 4] phenomena in MH lamps is that, when operated vertically, the metal halides in the lamp tend to demix; the concentration of metal halides in the gas phase is much greater {{at the bottom of the}} lamp. This can be observed directly from the light output, a demixed lamp shows a blue white mercury discharge at the top of the lamp and a much brighter and whiter discharge at the bottom of the lamp [5].

40|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering aluminium foam {{is starting to}} be a well known material. It is already used wherever lightweight construction and structural damping are demanded. Particularly for sandwich composites with steel cover sheets the foam shows its strength in rigidity against impulse. The common way of aluminium foam production is using a foamable semi-finished product. Manufactured by a powder-metallurgical procedure this semi-finished product can be produced with nearly any shape of cross section. The increase of volume during the foaming is immense. Even large cavities and gaps can be filled by the involving foam. In addition, aluminium foam is heat resistant up to approximately 500 °C. During the foam process the aluminium foam is able to establish an adhesive bond to other metals. Also it shows {{a significant decrease in}} volume during the solidification. Transferring these facts to known applications of other materials, the idea of using aluminium foam as joining material becomes obvious. The verification of this approach has been manifested in a research cooperation between the Osram GmbH and the Fraunhofer Institute. The industrial partner Osram GmbH manufactures <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>discharge</b> lamps primarily for medical, scientific or projection applications and for decorative illumination. The so called discharge lamp already heats up at the lower range of performance to a few hundred degrees Celsius - comparable to a usual electric bulb. Therefore the discharge lamp is made of fused quartz. For the electric contacting the fused quartz-shaft of the discharge lamp is connected to a metallic cap shell. Due to the high temperatures the bonding is realized with mineral based adhesives. Disadvantages of this method are a limited pot life, the drawn-out process of hardening and a disappointing long-time stability. Also most interfering is the difficulty of implementing this joining process into an automated production process. As one result of the research cooperation the potential of aluminium foam has been used here. By inserting a foamable semi-product between the fused quartz-shaft and the metallic cap shell during the assembling process and a following heat treatment, a durable hard composite between all components will emerge. The bonding maintains its stability due to the shrinkage of the aluminium foam onto the glass bulb and a metallic bond between the foam and the metallic shell. The capping with aluminium foam allows short process intervals and a simple process management. Therefore aluminium foam includes a remarkable potential of rationalisation. The lamps achieve the durability of conventional lamps without any problems...|$|E

40|$|Condition Monitoring is an {{area that}} has seen {{substantial}} growth in the last few decades. The purpose for implementing condition monitoring in industry is to increase productivity, decrease maintenance costs and increase safety. Therefore, condition monitoring can be used not only for planning maintenance but also for allowing the selection of the most efficient equipment to minimize operating costs. Hydraulic systems are widely used in industry, aerospace and agriculture and are becoming more complex in construction and in function. Reliability of the systems must be supported by an efficient maintenance scheme. Due to component wear or failure, some system parameters may change causing abnormal behaviour in each component or in the overall circuit. Research in this area has been substantial, and includes specialized studies on artificial fault simulation at the University of Saskatchewan. In this research, an axial pump was the focus of the study. In an axial piston pump, wear between the various faces of components can occur {{in many parts of the}} unit. As a consequence, leakage can occur in locations such as between the valve plate and barrel, the drive shaft and oil wiper, the control piston and piston guide, and the swash plate and slippers. In this study, wear (and hence leakage) between the pistons and cylinder bores in the barrel was of interest. Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan, as well as at other research institutions, have been involved in studies to detect wear in pumps using a variety of condition monitoring algorithms. However, to verify the reliability and indeed, limitations of some of the approaches, it is necessary to test the algorithms on systems with “real” leakage. To introduce actual wear in the piston of pumps can be very difficult and very expensive. Hence, introducing piston wear in an “artificial” manner would be of great benefit in the evaluation of various condition monitoring techniques. Since leakage is a direct consequence of piston wear, it is logical to conclude that varying the leakage in some prescribed manner can be used to artificially simulate wear. A prime concern, therefore, is to be able to precisely understand the dynamic relationships between the wear and leakage and the effect it has on the output flow or pressure waveform from the pump. Introducing an artificial leakage to simulate the wear of pistons is a complex task. The creation of an artificial leakage path was not simply a process of providing a resistive short to the tank at the outlet of the pump port as was done in other studies. The objective was to create a leakage environment that would simulate leakage from a single piston (or combination of several pistons thereof). The complexity of the flow and pressure ripple waveforms (which various condition monitoring algorithms did require) was such that a more comprehensive leakage behaviour had to be modeled and experimentally created. A pressure control servo valve with a very high frequency response was employed to divert the flow from the pump outlet with a prescribed waveform directly to the tank to simulate the piston leakage from the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>discharge</b> chamber to the pump case drain chamber as the simulated worn piston made contact with the high pressure chamber. The control algorithm could mimic the action of a single worn piston at various degrees of wear. The experimental results indicated that the experimental system could successfully introduce artificial leakage into the pump which was quite consistent with a unit with a “real” worn piston. Comparisons of the pressure ripples from an actual faulty pump (worn piston) and the “artificial” faulty pump (artificial leakage) are presented...|$|E
