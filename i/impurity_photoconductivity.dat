40|$|Two {{types of}} {{non-standard}} relaxation induced <b>impurity</b> <b>photoconductivity</b> (IIP) observed in photoconductors CdS, ZnSe, GaAs and others, {{depending on the}} kinetic characteristics of the traps are described. In one case, at the stage of post flashing monotonic decay which is typical for relaxation associated with slow traps (the ratio {{of the speed of}} the electron capture to the recombination rate (R > 1) : measurement alternating signal (f > 20 Hz) relaxation curves take the form of curves usual <b>impurity</b> <b>photoconductivity.</b> Electronic processes responsible for relaxation of non-standard IIP are analyzed. For example, fast-centers, which include the characteristic A II B VI donor Ag i 0, {{for the first time in}} semiconductors experimentally, investigated the dependence of the cross section of electron capture by traps energy released during localization...|$|E
40|$|We {{calculated}} energy levels, wave functions, and {{energies of}} radiative transitions in terahertz quantum cascade lasers based on GaAs/Al 0. 15 Ga 0. 85 As heterostructures. Current-voltage characteristics and current dependences of laser radiation intensity were measured, and the maximum operating temperatures reaching 85 K were determined. Radiation spectra of quantum cascade lasers were measured for different temperatures, {{and the effect}} of intensity “pumping” from lowfrequency modes to high-frequency modes was found to happen {{in the case of an}} increase in the current and time delay of the signal capture, which is explained by heating of the sample during a pulse of the current. Application of the lasers for registration of <b>impurity</b> <b>photoconductivity</b> signals in semiconductor heterostructures was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of intense short-pulsed THz radiation from {{sources such as}} free electron lasers (FELs) or synchrotrons demands broad-band detectors with very short response times. This triggered {{a renewed interest in}} fast germanium (Ge) detectors. The fastest operation of Ge detectors demonstrated in the THz region of the electromagnetic spectrum so far showed an about 2 -ns long decay time using highly compensated neutron transmutated p-Ge:Ga:As:Sb. The short-pulse narrow-band FEL radiation allows studying <b>impurity</b> <b>photoconductivity</b> kinetics and provides information important for optimizing the speed of response of extrinsic photoconductors. The capture of free holes and electrons in Ge doped by gallium (Ga) or antimony (Sb) has been studied by a time-resolved pump-probe experiment with the FEL FELBE at the HZDR. For Ga acceptors the relaxation times decrease with increasing pump power from approximately 3 ns to 1 ns (2 ns and 1 ns for Sb donors, respectively). The results support the development of fast photoconductive detectors in the THz region of the spectrum...|$|E
40|$|Starting from mid- 70 th, a {{great deal}} of both {{experimental}} and theoretical efforts has been attracted to the unexplained puzzle of impurity states arising in the IV-VI narrow-gap cubic semiconductors doped with some of the group III elements, and to the unusual effects observed in these materials. We review the experimental results obtained in the field: the electrical activity of <b>impurity</b> centers, persistent <b>photoconductivity</b> and related effects, unusual optical, dielectric and magnetic phenomena. Some of the features of these semiconductors, such as possibility of realization of the semiinsulating state with the persistent photoresponse, possibility of fast quenching of persistent photoconductivity, microwave stimulation of the quantum efficiency up to 100, and some others, have made it possible to construct the far-infrared photodetector with extremely high characteristics. The theoretical models proposed so far to account for the physical picture of the processes involved are discussed in view of the recent advances in the field. Many of the sensitive photodetecting systems operating in the far infrared wavelength range (20 - 200) mm are based on germanium or silicon doped with shallow impurities [1]. The highest cutoff wavelength reported lco » 220 mm corresponds to the uniaxially stresse...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the results on}} the {{investigation}} of the precularity near the solar spectrum region, of Zn 1 -xCdxS nanoparticles, nanofilms, nanoscale p-n and heterojunction prepared on glass-ceramic ad alumminium substrates by precipitation from aqueous solutions are presented. The temperature dependence of dark and light conductivity, spectrum and optical quenching of primary and <b>impurity</b> <b>photoconductivity</b> are investigated. The obtained results show that when controlling ionic composition and heat-treatment (HT) conditions, one can purposely control the properties of Zn 1 -xCdxS (0 x 0. 6) films, achieve the appropriate degree of compensation of different recombination levels and traps attributed to intrinsic defects or impurities, which result in high level of photoelectrical parameters near the IR region. Just after deposition the photoconductivity spectrum maximum of Cd 1 -xZnxS (0 x 0. 6) films is observed at  1 = 0. 445  0. 495 m versus the film composition. Subsequent to HT, the photoconductivity spectrum considerably widens and appears the impurity maximums at  2 = 0. 58  0. 69 m and  3 = 0. 95  1. 05 m...|$|E
