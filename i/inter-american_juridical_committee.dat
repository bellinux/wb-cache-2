5000|$|The Venezuelan president's {{antipathy}} for nondemocratic {{rule was}} reflected in the so-called Betancourt Doctrine, which denied Venezuelan diplomatic recognition to any regime, right or left, that came to power by military force. Betancourt always defended, and represented, democratic values and principles in Latin America. This put him at odds with the military strongmen who came to dominate and define political perception of the region.During his first message to Congress as President of Venezuela, on 12 February 1959, Betancourt said:"...Regimes disrespectful of human rights, violating their citizens´ freedom, tyrannizing them with the backing of totalitarian political police, should be submitted to a rigorous sanitary cordon and eradicated, through collective pacification, from the <b>Inter-American</b> <b>juridical</b> community" ...|$|R

40|$|This essay explicates Professor Boris Kozolchyk’s magnum opus, Comparative Commercial Contracts, as {{a vehicle}} for {{exploring}} the practical and philosophical foundations for effective efforts to promote international legal harmonization in private law. Its central thesis is that good practices are founded on the philosophical premises embedded in Kozolchyk’s work, which in turn are drawn from Kozolchyk’s practical experience. This experience yields a vision of practices reflecting those of the archetypal merchant, a bonus vir (a good man or person), and the conception of commercial justice as fairness and reasonableness made possible by practical guidance rooted in requirements of the bonus vir. The essay locates this insight in longstanding debate about the morality of market society, one that has been given new salience as protectionist forces now enjoy resurgence in response to dislocations brought about by the most recent wave of globalization. The essay author’s own experience as {{a former member of the}} <b>Juridical</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Organization of American States is brought to bear to supplement a study of the practical experience that gave rise to Kozolchyk’s central insights from a career of engaged practical scholarship, in part as Director of The National Law Center for Inter-American Free Trade (NLCIFT), affiliated with the University of Arizona College of Law, in which he has played a central role in developing practical instruments for legal harmonization in the Western Hemisphere, especially between the U. S. and the Caribbean Basin countries. Finally, this essay, drawing in part of suggestions in CCC but more significantly on literature concerning the creation and erosion of the social norms supporting trust in economic life, identifies challenges China’s integration in the world economy may pose for commercial law reasoning and practices based on Kozolchyk’s understanding of the bonus vir...|$|R

40|$|This article, {{which draws}} on the author 2 ̆ 7 s {{experience}} {{as a member of}} the <b>Inter-American</b> <b>Juridical</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Organization of American States, focuses on the problem of crafting an appropriate hemispheric regime for the protection of consumer rights. The subject is now a major element in the agenda of the OAS Specialized Conference on Private International Law (know also under its Spanish acronym as the CIDIP process), in part because of the increased salience of the issue in light of increasing e-commerce. The article, based on the author 2 ̆ 7 s presentation at a symposium at the St. Thomas School of Law in Minnesota on economic development in Latin America, argues that the problem of consumer protection in international transactions in the region needs to be re-conceptualized as a problem in international law an politics. It argues that the important welfare gains that can be achieved through a trade-based approach to consumer protection that avoids implicit subsidies for exporters and disguised discrimination or protectionism in favor of competing domestic producers needs to be coupled explicitly with a socio-political approach that takes advantage of pro-democratic and rule of law-enhancing effects of enhanced consumer protections. The article then argue that, in addition to being normatively compelling, this proposed re-conceptualization is in the foreign policy interest of the U. S. It concludes with an incremental legal strategy for developing this new agenda...|$|E
