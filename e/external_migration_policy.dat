40|$|Cooperation with non-EU {{countries}} {{is a central}} migration policy priority for the EU, and since 2008 eight Mobility Partnerships have been signed. Given the importance attached to this policy area, {{it is essential that}} policy-makers understand how EU <b>external</b> <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> works in practice. However, the literature on the implementation of EU <b>external</b> <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> is very limited. This article addresses this deficit, by conducting a conceptual assessment of implementation dynamics in the Mobility Partnerships. At this stage in the implementation process, it is not yet possible to assess whether the Mobility Partnerships have contributed to mobility, which is their stated aim. Instead, the literature on implementation is applied in a “backward” fashion, starting with the implementation dynamics at play. The article concludes that standard analytical frameworks for assessing implementation processes will need to be adapted for “new” policy tools featuring elements of flexibility or voluntary participation, in order to accurately capture implementation processes. Future research should adopt a critical, human rights-centred approach to the issue of implementation of EU <b>external</b> <b>migration</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|E

40|$|This CEPS Research Report {{provides}} a state-of-the-art {{analysis of the}} EU’s internal and <b>external</b> <b>migration</b> <b>policies</b> towards central and east Asian countries. It finds that these countries do not constitute {{a major source of}} irregular migration to Europe, but they manifest distinctly different socio-economic development prospects and enjoy different international relations statuses vis-à-vis the EU. Focusing on the different institutional actors, normative tools and policy instruments responsible for the development of EU external action, the author examines how the Union’s <b>migration</b> <b>policies</b> are designed, framed and implemented towards largely populated and rapidly industrialising ‘strategic partners’, such as China and India, as well as with developing countries including the Philippines and Thailand. Based on the evaluation of the impact that the existing framework of cooperation has on current migratory trajectories of Chinese, Indian, Filipino and Thai nationals, the paper put forward a set of policy recommendations.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the ongoing “migration crisis” the {{externalization}} of EU migration policy has continued. EU policy documents argue that cooperation with non-EU countries is essential in order to manage migration flows. But how successful is this policy? The public policy literature teaches us that “policy success” can be defined in varying ways: as goal achievement; as political success; in terms of norms; in terms of the costs associated with the policy; temporally; and in the light of external factors. An application of this analytical framework to the EU Mobility Partnerships uncovers conceptual and methodological challenges, and above all highlights the need for evaluation of EU <b>external</b> <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> to be taken more seriously...|$|E

Against all measures of success, the current public debate seems to suggest that the political consensus that migration is beneficial is broken. This comes with a crisis of European institutions in general. Migration and labor mobility have not been at the origin of the perceived cultural shift. The EU in its current form and ambition could perfectly survive or collapse even if it solves its migration challenge. But it will most likely collapse, if it fails to solve the mobility issue by not preserving free internal labor mobility and not establishing a joint <b>external</b> <b>migration</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|E
40|$|The present work {{intends to}} {{highlight}} the most relevant aspects of the choices of the EU’s <b>external</b> <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> through the instrument of Mobility Partnership which was proposed as general framework {{for the management of}} migration flows from third countries.

So, the partnership was included among the external migration policy’s instruments with additional and different features than its earlier namesakes of the Union’s external relations.

40|$|First {{published}} online: 21 December 2014 In {{order to}} increase the effectiveness of migration management, the EU increasingly enters into agreements with third countries. Such co-operation aims to engage third countries in migration control mechanisms in exchange for enhanced legal migration opportunities, yet this externalization of migration policy is highly selective with regard to both participating Member States and third countries. In this paper we develop a three-level game perspective to explain why Member States and third countries participate in EU <b>external</b> <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> initiatives. The three-level game links three sets of actors in two strategic interactions: Member States, EU institutions and third countries.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{dynamics}} of the EU <b>external</b> <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> by applying the external governance theory on the Global approach to migration (GAM) while exploring the nature of migration relations between the Union and the third countries. The Global approach to migration is based on the integration of migration issues (based on four thematic dimensions) in the EU external relations and on strengthening cooperation and dialogue with partner countries. The aim of the thesis is to clarify by the theory of external governance the relations between the EU and partner countries with which the EU cooperates in the management of migration flows. More specifically, the thesis focuses on mutual relations, which are reflected in cooperation on migration issues and answers the question whether GAM raised a qualitative change in relations between the EU and partner countries. Further, the text aspires on the reflection of the international role of the EU in its external relations of migration. The thesis identifies 10 major platforms of cooperation between the EU and third countries: (1) The European Neighbourhood Policy, (2) The Euro-African Process on Migration and Development, (3) The EU-Africa Partnership on Migration, Mobility and Employment, (4) The Union for Mediterranean, (5) Dialogue on [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Arab Spring and the unrest, revolution and war that followed {{during the course of}} 2011 have forced the EU to acknowledge the need to radically re-think its policy approach towards the Southern Mediterranean, including in the domain of migration. Migration and mobility now feature as key components of High Representative Catherine Ashton’s new framework for cooperation with the region (Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity), while the EU has declared its intention to strengthen its <b>external</b> <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> by setting up “mutually beneficial” partnerships with third countries – so-called ‘Dialogues for Migration, Mobility and Security’ – now placed at the centre of the EU’s renewed Global Approach to Migration and Mobility (GAMM). However, the success of this approach and its potential to establish genuine cooperative partnerships that will support smooth economic and political transformation in North Africa hinge on the working arrangements and institutional configurations shaping the renewed GAMM at EU level which has long been marked by internal fragmentation, a lack of transparency and a predominance of home affairs and security actors. This paper investigates the development of the Dialogues for Migration, Mobility and Security with the Southern Mediterranean in a post-Lisbon Treaty institutional setting. It asks to what extent has the application of the Lisbon Treaty and the creation of an “EU Foreign Minister” in High Representative Ashton, supported by a European External Action Service (EEAS), remedied or re-invigorated the ideological and institutional struggles around the implementation of the Global Approach? Who are the principal agents shaping and driving the Dialogues for Migration, Mobility and Security? Who goes abroad to speak on the behalf of the EU in these Dialogues and what impact does this have on the effectiveness, legitimacy and accountability of the Dialogues under the renewed GAMM as well as the wider prospects for the Southern Mediterranean...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} EU {{policy-making}} process concerning the <b>external</b> dimension of <b>migration</b> {{focusing on the}} EU’s eastern neighbourhood. In recent years, {{there has been an}} increasing emphasis on integrating a comprehensive migration dimension into the broader external policies of the EU. In 2004, the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) was developed as an overarching foreign policy tool integrating the EU’s existing policies towards its southern and eastern neighbourhood under a single framework with the objective of ensuring security and stability in the EU's neighbourhood. The management of cross-border movements along the EU’s new eastern frontiers in particular has moved up on the EU agenda with the eastern shift of the EU borders following the 2004 / 2007 eastern enlargements. With the increasing integration of <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> objectives into the EU’s broader neighbourhood policy, the EU has progressively established a more streamlined form of cooperation with its immediate eastern neighbours concerning different dimensions of <b>migration</b> <b>policy.</b> The thesis examines the EU policy-making process with the aim of answering the question of how the EU policy has been shaped in the view of diverging national preferences and institutional roles and influence concerning the <b>external</b> dimension of <b>migration</b> <b>policy.</b> As a salient policy area central to national sovereignty and interest, the EU member states traditionally seek to control the impact of institutional constraints in the area of <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> and support mechanisms by which they could exert national control over the policy outcomes. On the other hand, the increasing ‘communitarisation’ of the policy area since the Amsterdam Treaty has enhanced the role of the EU institutions.

40|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 1970 s, the <b>migration</b> <b>policies</b> of {{developed}} European countries were {{based on the assumption that}} controlling immigration was possible. Due to various reasons discussed in this article, such policies proved unsuccessful. The result was an increase in the total number of foreigners and a change in the composition of immigrant communities, i. e. the proportion of supported family members increased. During the 1980 s there was increasing convergence in the <b>migration</b> <b>policies</b> of European immigration countries and traditional overseas emigration countries. Policies were more and more oriented towards preventing illegal migration flows, on regulating refugee flows and on balancing labour migration with family migration. The turning-point in the direction of “harmonising” West European <b>migration</b> <b>policies</b> was marked by the Schengen agreement (1985) on gradual elimination of border controls between the signing parties (France, Germany and the Benelux countries). Fear in the face of a possible invasion of Eastern Europeans after the collapse of socialism in 1989 was a further strong stimulus towards the harmonisation of <b>migration</b> <b>policies</b> in the developing EU. As opposed to migration control, the integration of immigrants has remained so far the prerogative of nation-states. The text further presents an overview of <b>migration</b> <b>policy</b> reforms in individual member states of the EU and of multilateral actions. The post- 1989 migration regime in Europe has four major traits: 1) an extension of the agenda; 2) an accent on joint actions; 3) defensiveness; 4) confusion and an overload of issues.

40|$|By {{examining}} the implementation dynamics of EU Readmission Agreements (EURAs), this book addresses the practical reasons why irregular immigrants cannot be expelled. EURAs {{are one of}} the vital legal instruments framing EU <b>external</b> <b>migration</b> law with regard to the expulsion of irregular immigrants, yet their implementation has met with various obstacles. Above all, the process of determining an individual’s legal identity has proven {{to be one of the}} most controversial aspects in the implementation of EURAs. The analysis shows that the process of identifying who is whose national in the context of readmission creates two existential dilemmas: first from the perspective of the sovereignty of third countries of origin and the legal standards laid out in international instruments as regards states’ powers in determining nationality, and second regarding the agency of the individual as a holder of fundamental human rights. How do the EURAs deal with or aim at alleviating these identity determination dilemmas? The book provides a comparative analysis of the administrative procedures and rules envisaged by EURAs aimed at proving or presuming the nationality of the persons to be readmitted to their country of origin. It focuses on the ways in which nationality is to be determined or presumed in the scope of the 2010 EURA with Pakistan, and compares it with those foreseen in the EURAs with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cape Verde, Georgia, and Turkey. As such, the book provides a unique and up-to-date study of EURAs and their implementation challenges in the broader context of EU <b>external</b> <b>migration</b> law and <b>policy...</b>|$|R
