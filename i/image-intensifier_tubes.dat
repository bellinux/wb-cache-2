5000|$|The AN/PVS-5 is a dual-tube night-vision goggle {{used for}} {{aviation}} and ground support. It uses second-generation <b>image-intensifier</b> <b>tubes</b> which are poor for today's standards. The United States Army still has PVS-5 on supply but are very rarely used. The AN/PVS-5 {{is based on}} the SU-50 which was a first-generation night-vision goggle adapted by the United States Air Force in 1971. From 1972 until 1990 the AN/PVS-5 was the mainstay in United States Army night vision for aviation. The AN/PVS-5C was not approved for flight because of its auto-gated feature causing the goggle to shut off in bright light. For ground troops the AN/PVS-5 was the sole night-vision goggle until the adaptation of the improved AN/PVS-7.|$|E

Enables human or automatic controller to monitor both weld pool on front and weld penetration on back. Nitrogen laser generates ultraviolet light, distributed to both sides of workpiece through two optical fiber cables. <b>Image-intensifier</b> <b>tubes</b> convert reflected ultraviolet light to visible light. Video cameras equipped with high-resolution charge-coupled devices convert visible outputs of image intensifiers into images for viewing on video monitors...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the construction and}} performance of a scintillating fiber detector used in the near detector for the K 2 K (KEK to Kamioka, KEK E 362) long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. The detector uses 3. 7 m long and 0. 692 mm diameter scintillating fiber coupled to <b>image-intensifier</b> <b>tubes</b> (IIT), and a CCD camera readout system. Fiber sheet production and detector construction began in 1997, and the detector was commissioned in March, 1999. Results from the first K 2 K runs confirm good initial performance : position resolution {{is estimated to be}} about 0. 8 mm, and track finding efficiency is 98 ± 2...|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} devices feature {{an improved}} <b>image-intensifier</b> <b>tube</b> utilizing micro-channel plate (MCP) with an S-25 photocathode, {{resulting in a}} much brighter image, especially {{around the edges of}} the lens. This leads to increased illumination in low ambient light environments, such as moonless nights. Light amplification is around 20,000×. Also improved were image resolution and reliability.|$|R
40|$|Neutron yields form DT-filled ICF targets {{have reached}} 10 {sup 14 }. Above 10 {sup 13 }, a {{significant}} neutron-induced background appears in images recorded with nearby streak cameras. Since cameras components (streak <b>tube,</b> <b>image-intensifier</b> <b>tube,</b> and CCD array) {{are similar to}} components {{that will be used}} in many NIF instruments, streak camera images provide information about neutron-induced backgrounds that will be encountered in the NIF environment. At a fluence of 10 {sup 7 } neutrons/cm{sup 2 }, the background consists of two distinct components: a uniform component equal to nearly 20 % of the camera`s linear range and sharp, intense peaks each localized to just a couple of image pixels. About 80 % of the uniform background is caused by interactions with the streak <b>tube</b> and <b>image-intensifier</b> <b>tube.</b> Nearly all of the sharp spikes are caused by interactions with pixels of the CCD array. The spikes make the most significant contribution to image noise...|$|R
40|$|The CERN 1 RD 46 Collaboration is {{developing}} a new high resolution tracking detector based on glass capillaries filled with liquid scintillator. In this framework we have built a read-out chain based on a newly developed device: the Megapixel Electron-Bombarded CCD (EBCCD). This device is a hybrid <b>image-intensifier</b> <b>tube,</b> with a 1024 x 1024 pixels CCD chip {{in place of the}} phosphor screen. The tube has a 40 mm diameter photocathode, is gateable and zoomable from 0. 62 to 1. 3. The EBCCD tube is able to detect single photoelectrons, with a signal to noise ratio better than 10. This Megapixel multichannel photon counting device is attractive for many applications in high-energy physics, astrophysics, biomedical diagnostics, and very low-light imaging...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} large high-resolution tracking detectors based on glass capillaries filled with organic liquid scintillator of high refractive index. These liquid-core scintillating optical fibres act simultaneously as detectors of charged particles and as image guides. Track images projected onto the readout {{end of a}} capillary bundle are visualized by an optoelectronic chain consisting {{of a set of}} <b>image-intensifier</b> <b>tubes</b> followed by a photosensitive CCD or by an EBCCD camera. Two prototype detectors, each composed of ≈ 10 ^ 6 capillaries with 20 - 25 μm diameter and 0. 9 - 1. 8 m length, have been tested, and a spatial resolution of the order of 20 - 40 μm has been attained. A high scintillation efficiency and a large light-attenuation length, in excess of 3 m, was achieved through special purification of the liquid scintillator. Along the tracks of minimum-ionizing particles, the hit densities obtained were ∼ 8 hits/mm at the readout window, and ∼ 3 hits/mm at ∼ 1 m away. The level of radiation resistance of the prototype detectors is at least an order of magnitude higher than that of other tracking devices of comparable performance...|$|E
40|$|Angiography is {{the process}} of injecting {{contrast}} material directly into the arterial system by means of a catheter placed near the organ or body part of interest. The result is looked at by means of an X-ray fluoroscope, in which the X-ray image is formed on the screen of an <b>image-intensifier</b> <b>tube</b> and then picked up by a television camera for display on a television monitor. An alternative approach, called Digital Fluoroscopy, is that of looking at the “difference” picture, between the X-ray before and after injection of contrast material. In such a case, the sensitivity of the difference picture to the contrast material is so great that only an intravenous drip of the contrast material is required, thus eliminating the necessity for injection directly into the arterial system, as in the angiographic process. We have designed, constructed, and installed such a device in the Georgetown University Radiology Clinic...|$|R
40|$|A hybrid <b>image-intensifier</b> <b>tube,</b> {{suitable}} for extremely low-light imaging, has been tested. This device {{is based on}} an Electron-Bombarded CCD chip (EBCCD) with 1024 × 1024 sensitive pixe ls. The tube, which has a photocathode diameter of 40 mm, is gateable and zoomable, with an image magnification varying from 0. 62 to 1. 3. The high gain (about 4000 collected electrons per photo electron at the operational voltage of 15 kV) and the relatively low noise (180 electrons per pixel at 10 MHz pixel-readout frequency), allows single-photoelectron signals to be separated from n oise with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10. By applying an appropriate threshold on the signal amplitude, the background can almost be eliminated, with a loss of few percent in single-ph otoelectron counting. High inner gain, low noise, single-photoelectron sensitivity, and high spatial resolution make the EBCCD imaging tube a unique device, attractive for many applications in h igh-energy physics, astrophysics, biomedical diagnostics...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; Distribution is unlimitedNight vision sensors, such as <b>image-intensifier</b> (II) <b>tubes</b> in night vision goggles and forward looking {{infrared}} sensors (FLIR) are routinely used by U. S. naval personnel for night operations. The quality of imagery from these devices however, {{can be extremely}} poor. Since these sensors exploit {{different regions of the}} electromagnetic spectrum, the information they provide is often complimentary, and therefore, improvements are possible with the enhancement and subsequent fusion of this information into a single presentation. Such processing can maximize scene content by incorporating information from both images as well as increase contrast and dynamic range. This thesis introduces a new algorithm, which produces such an enhanced/fused image. It performs adaptive enhancement of both the low-light visible (II) and thermal infrared imagery (IR) inputs, followed by a data fusion for combining the two images into a composite image. The methodology for visual testing of the algorithm for comparison of fused and original II and IR imagery is also presented and a discussion of the results is included. Tests confirmed that the fusion algorithm resulted in significant improvement over either single-band image[URL] United States Nav...|$|R
