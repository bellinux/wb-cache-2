These investigations provide systematic empirical foundations for assessing Asian <b>dairy</b> <b>markets</b> with their new consumption patterns, changing industries, and trade prospects under different domestic and trade policy regimes. The findings are drawn from four case studies (China, India, Japan, and Korea), as well as a prospective analysis of future regional patterns of consumption and a policy analysis of trade liberalization of Asian <b>dairy</b> <b>markets.</b> The overview distills the findings of these new investigations and integrates them in the earlier economic literature; it draws policy implications and identifies lessons for countries outside of Asia, especially for emerging exporters in Latin America.

40|$|This Discussion Paper {{shows that}} the demand for {{imported}} dairy products {{will continue to be}} strong in Mexico, especially after the 2001 - 2002 recession ends. However, Mexico's <b>dairy</b> <b>markets</b> have matured under the NAFTA. As part of the maturity, a larger number of strong domestic firms have emerged and powerful European multi-nationals have increased dairy product sales in Mexico. In addition, the expansion of U. S. exports of fluid milk, yogurt, dried whey, and lactose to Mexico will be slow in near future because U. S. market shares of imports of these products are already large.

50|$|Cottage {{cheese is}} a popular {{commodity}} in Israel which is widely perceived as a basic food item by the Israeli public. The Tnuva cooperative controls more than 70% of the <b>dairy</b> <b>market,</b> while the companies Strauss and Tara control {{the rest of the}} market. In addition, importation of dairy products into Israel before the boycott was minimal due to the extremely high import duties imposed on them, with duties for some dairy imports standing over 100%. Due to Tnuva's dominance of the Israeli <b>dairy</b> <b>market,</b> it is considered a legal monopoly by the Israel Antitrust Authority, which has the power to regulate its prices to prevent it from price gouging. In August 2008, Israeli Finance Minister Avraham Hirschson declared that the government would stop regulating the price of cottage cheese, which stood at 4.82 NIS for a 250 ml (9-ounce) tub, in order to encourage competition in this market. Contrary to the expectations, within three years the price of cottage cheese rose by about 45% of the original price, up to approximately 8 NIS.|$|E
