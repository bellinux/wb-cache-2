5|$|During the American {{assault on}} Attu Island, 2,400 Japanese troops were killed, and only 25 were captured. The Americans' losses were {{significantly}} lower, at 566 dead and 1,442 wounded. The {{bodies of the}} killed Japanese troops were buried in mass graves on the island – only five per cent of Japanese troops fighting on Attu Island wore dog tags, making identification difficult. In addition, many fallen Japanese were buried by their fellow soldiers up in the island's peaks, and many bodies still remain undiscovered. The American burials were undertaken at Massacre Bay {{as well as at}} Holtz Bay – in the former case, the bodies of the soldiers were buried in group graves. Large <b>holes</b> <b>of</b> seven feet in depth were dug by bulldozers, and eight small foot-deep graves were dug at the bottom of each of these holes to serve as the American soldiers' final resting places.|$|E
5|$|Like wolves, coyotes use a den (usually {{the deserted}} <b>holes</b> <b>of</b> other species) when gestating and rearing young, {{though they may}} {{occasionally}} give birth under sagebrushes in the open. Coyote dens can be located in canyons, washouts, coulees, banks, rock bluffs, or level ground. Some dens have been found under abandoned homestead shacks, grain bins, drainage pipes, railroad tracks, hollow logs, thickets, and thistles. The den is continuously dug and cleaned out by the female until the pups are born. Should the den be disturbed or infested with fleas, the pups are moved into another den. A coyote den can have several entrances and passages branching out from the main chamber. A single den can be used year after year.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{a modern}} soprano {{clarinet}} is equipped with numerous tone <b>holes</b> <b>of</b> which seven (six front, one back) are covered with the fingertips, and the rest are opened or closed using a set of keys. These tone holes let the player produce every note of the chromatic scale. On alto and larger clarinets, and a few soprano clarinets, key-covered holes replace some or all finger holes. The most common system of keys was named the Boehm system by its designer Hyacinthe Klosé in honour of flute designer Theobald Boehm, {{but it is not}} the same as the Boehm system used on flutes. The other main system of keys is called the Oehler system and is used mostly in Germany and Austria (see History). The related Albert system is used by some jazz, klezmer, and eastern European folk musicians. The Albert and Oehler systems are both based on the early Mueller system.|$|E

5|$|Flying foxes {{often come}} to the {{attention}} of Australian wildlife care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, Wildlife Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, Tweed Valley Wildlife Carers, WIRES, and Wildlife Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe fruit tree netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small apertures / <b>holes</b> <b>of</b> 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of wildlife safe netting products will see a marked decline in flying fox entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden on wildlife rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E

We prove three weaker statements: (1) Every triangle-free graph with sufficiently large chromatic number has an odd <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> length different from five; (2) For all $l$, every triangle-free graph with sufficiently large chromatic number contains either a 5 -hole or an odd <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> length more than $l$; (3) For all $k$, $l$, every graph with no clique of size more than $k$ and sufficiently large chromatic number contains either a 5 -hole or a <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> length more than $l$...|$|R
40|$|A new supersymmetric black <b>hole</b> {{solution}} <b>of</b> five-dimensional supergravity is presented. It has {{an event}} horizon of topology S 1 X S 2. This {{is the first}} example of a supersymmetric, asymptotically flat black <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> nonspherical topology. The solution is uniquely specified by its electric charge and two independent angular momenta. These conserved charges can be arbitrarily close, but not exactly equal, to those of a supersymmetric black <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> spherical topology...|$|R
25|$|Each {{player has}} 16 spatula-shaped pieces with a bottom end fitting into the <b>holes</b> <b>of</b> the board. One player has pieces that are rather wide and thin; {{whereas the other}} player's pieces are more obelisk-shaped. At the {{beginning}} of the game, player A's pieces are placed in the <b>holes</b> <b>of</b> row A so that the spatulas are perpendicular to the row (un-dalled), and equivalently for player B. Later in the game, the pieces will be turned (fordallede, or dalled) so that the spatula is parallel to the rows.|$|E

25|$|The {{video is}} {{shot in a}} grey room, where Yonezu wearing a flower wreath and long hair {{covering}} his face sits down to read a picture book. The picture book illustrates the song, showing pictures of two hands {{on top of each}} other, and a couple separated in every moment of their lives by a glass pane. Yonezu walks around the room, and finds holes in the room, with light shining through them. Further along there is a barren tree, with the lyrics of the song hanging on it. Yonezu sits under the tree with the book. The girl in the picture book leaves the drawings, leaving the male character alone. Yonezu starts to frantically claw at the <b>holes</b> <b>of</b> light, and falls down. On {{the other side of the}} <b>holes</b> <b>of</b> light, Yonezu performs the song with a band and an orchestra.|$|E
25|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of users accidentally {{touching}} energized conductors and thereby experiencing electric shock, plug and socket systems often incorporate safety features in addition to the recessed slots or <b>holes</b> <b>of</b> the energized socket.

25|$|Haworth Country Club is {{a private}} club, {{featuring}} 18 <b>holes</b> <b>of</b> golf. Like White Beeches, Haworth has been host to U.S. Open sectional qualifiers. Officially opened in 1965, the original course was designed by designer Toscana Filenti. In 1997, Haworth obtained full ownership of the Country Club's land from the local water company. In 2000, designer Robert Trent Jones Jr. redesigned the course.|$|E
