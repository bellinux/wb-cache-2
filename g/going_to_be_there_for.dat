5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family {{portraits in}} the office, and {{many members of}} the office take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) trying to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake Velcro suit, but Dwight's real motive was to try to get some of Philip Lipton's DNA to run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not get the opportunity. After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's diaper is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve the diaper, but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> the entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After she sits down, holding his hand, Dwight begins kissing her and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return.|$|E

500|$|Through the 1950s, Pierce {{generally}} {{spent the}} offseason helping his father run the family's Detroit pharmacy. He did not pursue a coaching career, {{even though a}} 1963 spring training poll of sportswriters had named him the top managerial prospect on the Giants. After leaving baseball, he was a White Sox television color analyst in 1970, briefly a partner in Oldsmobile and Cadillac dealerships, a stockbroker, then worked as a sales and public relations representative for the Continental Envelope company from 1974 until retiring in 1997. He also worked as a White Sox scout, discovering 1983 Rookie of the Year Ron Kittle. The White Sox retired his number 19 in 1987; {{he is one of}} only eight players so honored. He was named to the Sox Team of the Century in 2000, and was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2003. On October 4, 2005, Pierce threw out the first pitch before Game 1 of the AL Division Series against the Red Sox (a 14–2 win), as the White Sox began the postseason which culminated in the 2005 World Series title – their first championship in 88 years. In 2006, he was inducted into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame. On July 23, 2007, the White Sox unveiled a statue in Pierce's honor in the center field concourse of U.S. Cellular Field, joining likenesses of Charles Comiskey, Minnie Miñoso, Carlton Fisk, Luis Aparicio and Nellie Fox. Sculptors had borrowed photographs and measured his face, leading him to comment, [...] "I don't know why; it isn't the same measurement it was in the '50s." [...] Adding that he hoped statues of Hall of Fame shortstop Luke Appling and pitcher Ted Lyons – both stars of the 1930s and 1940s – might be added in the future, he nonetheless admitted his excitement over the honor, saying, [...] "I think of it more, in times to come, when my grandkids go out to the park, they'll see it. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> years." [...] The book [...] "Then Ozzie Said to Harold...": The Best Chicago White Sox Stories Ever Told, coauthored by Pierce, was published in March 2008.|$|E

Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms {{in front of you and}} gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified.

2500|$|When U-505 was {{donated to}} the Museum, she had been sitting {{neglected}} at the Portsmouth Navy Yard for nearly ten years; just about every removable part had been stripped from her interior. She was in no condition {{to serve as an}} exhibit. Admiral Gallery proposed a possible solution. At his suggestion, Lohr contacted the German manufacturers who had supplied U-505s original components and parts, asking for replacements. As the Admiral reported in his autobiography, Eight Bells and All's Well, to his and the museum's surprise, every company supplied the requested parts without charge. Most included letters that said in effect, [...] "We are sorry that you have our U-boat, but since she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> many years, we want her to be a credit to German technology." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{an effort}} to induce the {{regrowth}} of the reefs, scientists placed electrified cones anywhere from 20 - 60 ft below the surface to provide a substrate for larval coral attachment. In 2004, scientists witnessed corals regenerating. Corals began to eject pink-orange eggs and sperm. The growth of these electrified corals was five times faster than untreated corals. Scientist Azeez Hakim stated: before 1998, we never thought that this reef would die. We had always taken for granted that these animals would be there, that this reef would be there forever. El Niño gave us a wake-up call that these things are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> ever.
