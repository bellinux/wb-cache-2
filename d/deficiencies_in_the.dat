5|$|A C Benson was {{a friend}} of Henry James, to whom Walpole wrote a fan letter late in 1908, with Benson's encouragement. A {{correspondence}} ensued and in February 1909 James invited Walpole to lunch at the Reform Club in London. They developed a close friendship, described by James's biographer Leon Edel as resembling a father and son relationship in some, but not all, respects. James was greatly taken with the young Walpole, though clear-eyed about the <b>deficiencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> artistry and craftsmanship of his protégé's early efforts. According to Somerset Maugham, Walpole made a sexual proposition to James, who was too inhibited to respond. Nevertheless, in their correspondence the older man's devotion was couched in extravagant terms.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April, the British Admiral Henry Wood and the German Admiral Eugen Kalau vom Hofe {{began an}} {{inspection}} of the Ottoman fleet, which concluded that {{only a handful of}} ships were seaworthy, and as a result, should not be used offensively. Through April and May, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. On 15 May, Hamidiye and the ironclads Mesudiye, Necm-i Şevket, , and , along with several other vessels conducted a major training exercise under the supervision of von Hofe, where severe <b>deficiencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> level of training were revealed, particularly with the men's ability to operate the ships' guns. In September 1897, the war came to an end, and the Ottoman fleet returned to Constantinople.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} goal is {{to study}} probability, period of development and characteristics of a clinical course of chronic prostatitis {{against the background of}} androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging male. Materials and methods: The Aging Male Symptoms (AMS) rating scale has been applied for androgen deficiency evaluation and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) — for chronic prostatitis evaluation. 57 men with chronic prostatitis in combination with androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging male have been examined. Results: It has been concluded that the development of chronic prostatitis against the background of androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging male occurs in a shorter time period and about 1. 5 times more frequently compared to androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging male at the background of chronic prostatitis. The analysis of time periods between the onset of chronic prostatitis symptoms against the background of androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging male and androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging male symptoms against the background of chronic prostatitis showed that androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging male symptoms have been revealed 1 - 2 years earlier than the onset of chronic prostatitis. The development of androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging male against the background of chronic prostatitis has showed a backward tendency. Signs of chronic prostatitis have been more frequently occurred in a period of four-five years earlier <b>the</b> androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging male development. Conclusion: The risk of development of chronic prostatitis against the background of androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging male during the next two years is actually four times higher <b>in</b> comparison with <b>the</b> development of androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging male against the background of chronic prostatitis. According to the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), patients with chronic prostatitis in combination with androgen <b>deficiency</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aging male showed higher degree of severity than patients with isolated development of chronic prostatitis...|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} month they were relocated once more, {{this time to}} Queensland where they undertook training exercises and defensive duties along the coast between Brisbane and Tweed Heads on the New South Wales border. At this time, the Army began to rectify the <b>deficiencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> division's equipment lists and battalions began receiving new machine guns, motor transport and Bren carriers. As the situation in New Guinea grew worse, {{the decision was made}} to reorganise the 3rd Division and throughout August, four battalions were amalgamated—the 37th, 52nd, 58th and 59th. In September, the 10th Brigade was disbanded and its battalions reallocated to the 4th and 15th Brigades. In October the 29th and 46th Battalions were also amalgamated, leaving the division with just six infantry battalions in two brigades.|$|E
5|$|The {{submarines}} {{have been}} the subject of many incidents and technical problems since the design phase, including accusations of foul play and bias during the design selection, improper handling of design changes during construction, major capability <b>deficiencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first submarines, and ongoing technical problems throughout the early life of the class. These problems have been compounded by the inability of the RAN to retain sufficient personnel to operate the submarines—by 2008, only three could be manned, and between 2009 and 2012, on average two or fewer were fully operational. The resulting negative press has led to a poor public perception of the Collins class.|$|E
5|$|When {{they entered}} service, the IK-3s {{suffered}} from minor equipment and instrument faults, largely caused by <b>deficiencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yugoslav aeronautical industry which {{had resulted in}} a mixture of foreign and Yugoslav-made instruments being fitted to the aircraft. The Yugoslav Minister of War approved the acquisition of a further 48 IK-3s to be delivered in 1941–42. The operational aircraft were allocated to the 51st Independent Fighter Group at Zemun, six each to the 161st Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Savo Poljanec) and the 162nd Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Todor Gogić). The IK-3 was then tested against Yugoslav Messerschmitt Bf 109Es in mock dogfights. The evaluation concluded that the IK-3 had several advantages over the Bf 109E; the Yugoslav aircraft was more manoeuvrable in level flight, enabling it to quickly get behind a pursuing Bf 109E by making tight horizontal turns.|$|E

5|$|The Australians {{were also}} {{experiencing}} their own supply problems. To {{enable them to}} mount a counter-attack, it was vital that they build up a stockpile of supplies in the forward areas. To reduce the burden placed on the native carrier system the Allies turned to aerial resupply, a technique that was still in its infancy. The loss of Kokoda had deprived them of a forward airfield, but to an extent this had been alleviated by {{the creation of a}} supply drop zone for US transport aircraft around the dry lake at Myola. These efforts, though, were hamstrung by <b>deficiencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aerial resupply process and inexperience in its application. Only a few supplies were dropped by parachute, while the rest were just free-dropped. Inevitably some supplies fell away from their intended drop zones, while others were damaged due to inadequate packaging. Additionally, poor staff work and inattention resulted in fewer supplies being collected in the drop zone than Potts had been promised. This had the effect of slowing the arrival of the Australian reinforcements as they had to be held up and then committed piecemeal company by company, as adequate supplies could be brought forward to sustain them.|$|E
5|$|The Report to the Minister for Defence on the Collins class {{submarine}} {{and related}} matters (commonly {{referred to as}} the McIntosh-Prescott Report) was compiled in ten weeks, and released on 1 June 1999. This report concluded that the Collins class was incapable of performing at the required level for military operations. Although the report highlighted several elements of the submarine design that performed to or beyond expectations, and acknowledged that many of the publicised problems had been or {{were in the process of}} being fixed, it presented the propulsion system, combat system, and excessive noise as ongoing problems across the class. After identifying the combat system as the central problem, McIntosh and Prescott recommended that it be scrapped entirely and replaced with a system based on commercially available equipment and software. They also claimed that these problems were caused by poor design and manufacture; inappropriate design requirements; <b>deficiencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> structure of the contract, particularly with regards to modifying the contract to meet changing requirements; and problems between the various parties involved in the construction of the submarines, with a lack of overall direction and conflicts of interest causing avoidable hostility and uncooperativeness. Despite the report being promoted by the government as 'ground-breaking', many people involved with the Collins-class project later claimed that large sections of the report could have been copied from reports previously submitted by the RAN or ASC.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} North American {{calendar of}} the ELCA {{was different from}} its European counterparts in {{that it does not}} give equal weight (and sometimes gives no mention) to persons who may be commemorated in Scandinavian regions. One example would be the absence of St. Lucia on December 13, although she enjoys particular popularity in Sweden. But Lutheran calendars also differ amongst one another in North America, with some individuals commemorated on multiple calendars but on different days (e.g., St. Bernard of Clairvaux on August 19 in the LCMS and August 20 in the ELCA) or individuals commemorated on one calendar and not the other (e.g., Martin Luther King, Jr. on January 15 for the ELCA and C. F. W. Walther on May 7 for the LCMS); with the 2006 publication of Evangelical Lutheran Worship (ELW) as a replacement to the Lutheran Book of Worship (LBW), some of these <b>deficiencies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ELCA calendar have been corrected. Within the ELCA, This Far by Faith and Libro de Liturgia y Cantico both prescribe calendars with additional commemorations specific to the ethnic communities they were intended to be used in (African Americans and Latinos respectively). The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod has a different, somewhat minimized calendar when compared the LCMS and especially the ELCA.|$|E
