5|$|A {{sense of}} destiny {{is present in}} the novel through {{patterns}} of repetition, including reversals of destiny in a number of characters. Characters who are paired together tend to suffer the same destiny: Ti Noel and Monsieur Lenormand de Mezy both witness the marvels of the age and slowly decline; both Pauline and Solimán indulge in their wealthy positions and then sink into madness. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> pattern of succession from fortune to misfortune.|$|E
5|$|A softer {{and more}} tuneful musical call {{has been called}} the toy-trumpet call. It has been {{reported}} to foretell rainy weather. The loud bell call resembles the clinking call, and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> piping sound. Females and young make an insistent repetitive squawking when begging for food from a parent or mate, similar to the begging call of the Australian magpie, and make a gobbling sound when fed.|$|E
5|$|Arak is a Levantine {{alcoholic}} spirit (~40–63% Alc. Vol./~80–126 proof) {{from the}} anis drinks family, common in Israel {{and throughout the}} Middle East. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear,</b> colorless, unsweetened anise-flavored distilled alcoholic drink (also labeled as an Apéritif). It is often served neat or mixed with ice and water, which creates a reaction turning the liquor a milky-white colour. It is sometimes also mixed with grapefruit juice to create a cocktail known as 'Arak eshkoliyyot', literally 'Arak grapefruit'.|$|E

5|$|In {{the era of}} the {{influential}} linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary. Although onomatopoeia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> exception, since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic, the Saussurean approach was to treat these as marginal exceptions. ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges this theory.|$|E
5|$|Meyer Wolfshiem– a Jewish {{friend and}} mentor of Gatsby's, {{described}} as a gambler who fixed the World Series. Wolfshiem appears only twice in the novel, the second time refusing to attend Gatsby's funeral. He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> allusion to Arnold Rothstein, a New York crime kingpin who was notoriously blamed for the Black Sox Scandal which tainted the 1919 World Series.|$|E
5|$|Risk to {{defensive}} capabilities: Security {{forces are}} not changing armaments annually, and thus small arms manufacturers need civilians as key customers. Crippling of civilian firearms market would likely lead to end of firearms manufacturing in the Czech Republic. At the same time, familiarity with semi-automatic versions of army rifles by civilians <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> defensive advantage in case these {{people need to}} be drafted to defend the country.|$|E

It is polyestrous, having many periods of sexual receptivity during a year. In captivity however, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> birth peak between March and May. It has been observed that reproductive patterns of captive prosimians in the northern hemisphere are altered. The estrus cycle lasts 29–45 days, with most copulations occurring on the same day.|$|E

5|$|A widely {{consumed}} liquor among Palestinian Christians, non-religious Palestinians {{and many}} less-stringently observant Muslims is Arak. Arak <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> anise-flavored alcoholic drink that {{is mixed with}} water to soften it {{and give it a}} creamy white color. It is consumed during special occasions such as holidays, weddings, and gatherings or with the mezze. Beer is also a consumed drink and the Palestinian town of Taybeh in the central West Bank contains one of the few breweries in Palestine. In addition to regular beer, the brewery produces non-alcoholic beer for observant Muslims. The nearby town of Birzeit is also home to Shepherds Brewery.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear,</b> colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E
5|$|Some lessons {{identified}} in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show that those who read the books were significantly different {{than those who had}} not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more opposed to violence and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical. Although it is not known if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.|$|E

5|$|The skull {{is similar}} in shape to that of M.mystacinus and M.brandtii, but the front part of the braincase is higher. The second and third upper premolars (P2 and P3) are tiny and pressed against the upper canine (C1) and fourth premolar (P4). The canine is less {{well-developed}} than in M.mystacinus. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> cusp present {{on the side of}} the P4. The accessory cusp known as the protoconule is present on each of the upper molars when they are unworn. M.mystacinus lacks the P4 cusp and the protoconules on the molars, but M.brandtii has an even larger cusp on P4.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{asserts that}} there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> {{continuity}} {{from the earlier}} apes of five million years ago to the anatomically modern humans who diverged from them, citing the genetic and social similarities between humans and chimpanzees. He attributes the divergence of the two species from a common ancestor {{to a change in}} their ecological niche; the ancestors of chimpanzees remained in the forests of equatorial Africa, whereas the ancestors of humans moved to open woodland and were exposed to different evolutionary pressures. Although Wade posits that much of human evolution {{can be attributed to the}} physical environment, he also believes that one of the major forces shaping evolution has been the nature of human society itself.|$|E
5|$|While Star Trek {{in general}} {{features}} few overt references to religion, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> recognition that a laying aside of past hurts {{is necessary for}} peace, similar {{to the concept of}} shalom in Judaism. Shatner regretted that Kirk's angst at being outmoded was minimized in the final print. A scene where Spock asks Kirk if they have grown so old and inflexible they have outlived their usefulness had two meanings: it was as much Nimoy asking Shatner as it was their characters.|$|E

5|$|While {{temperatures}} are somewhat lower on Gerlachovský štít {{because of its}} elevation, the weather and its potential impact on visitors is little different from other summits in the High Tatras both with and without marked trails. The typical daily weather pattern in the summer <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> morning, clouds gathering by mid-morning—noon, occasional showers and storms in the afternoon. The chance of rain is lowest between 9–10 am and peaks between 2–3 pm, with a drop-off after 6pm. The frequency of storms with lightning (as opposed to rainstorms) on Gerlach's summit {{and on the other}} highest ridges is little different from lower elevations, too, but people exposed to wind, (sometimes freezing) rain, and lightning have greater difficulty to cope. The nearest shelter for those who ascend Gerlach is the Sliezsky Dom Hotel, there are no natural shelters along the route.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear,</b> {{colourless}} {{transcellular fluid}} that circulates around {{the brain in}} the subarachnoid space, in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord. It also fills some gaps in the subarachnoid space, known as subarachnoid cisterns. The four ventricles, two lateral, a third, and a fourth ventricle, all contain choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal fluid. The third ventricle lies in the midline and {{is connected to the}} lateral ventricles. A single duct, the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral apertures, drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns. From here, cerebrospinal fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid mater and pia mater.|$|E
5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E
