5|$|Graham led the AAFC {{in passing}} and was voted the league's most {{valuable}} player. Pro Football Illustrated named Brown the AAFC {{coach of the}} year. Speedie and Lavelli were the AAFC's top two receivers in receptions and receiving yards. Colella tied for the AAFC lead with six interceptions on the year. Motley was the AAFC's third-leading rusher, with 889 yards, and Gillom came in second in punting average, with 44.6 yards. Speedie, Lou Rymkus, <b>Graham</b> <b>and</b> Motley were chosen unanimously by sportswriters for an all-AAFC team. Lavelli and Bill Willis were also selected {{by some of the}} writers. <b>Graham</b> <b>and</b> Speedie were named first-team selections when the Associated Press put together a combined AAFC and NFL All-Pro list.|$|E

Since then, many authors of fiction concerning Waterloo have recreated the events at the gate, and even if they include their own fictional heroes they attribute the closing of the gate to Macdonnell and Graham.|$|E

5|$|The phylogenetic {{analysis}} of <b>Graham</b> <b>and</b> Barrett (2004) supported the infrageneric division of Narcissus into two clades {{corresponding to the}} subgenera Hermione and Narcissus, but does not support monophyly of all sections, with only Apodanthi demonstrating clear monophyly, corresponding to Clade III of <b>Graham</b> <b>and</b> Barrett (see Cladogram), although some other clades corresponded approximately to known sections. These authors examined 36 taxa of the 65 listed then, and a later extended analysis by Rønsted et al. (2008) with five additional taxa confirmed this pattern.|$|E
5|$|Although Pat Nixon was a Methodist, she and {{her husband}} {{attended}} whichever Protestant Church was nearest to their home, especially after moving to Washington.

5|$|Before {{the start}} of the Browns' 1954 {{training}} camp, Graham was questioned as part of the Sam Sheppard murder case. Sheppard, an osteopath, was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death, and <b>Graham</b> <b>and</b> his wife, Beverly, were friends with the couple.

5|$|The 1947 {{season was}} another strong one for Speedie. In {{a game against}} the Buffalo Bills, he tied a {{professional}} football record by catching a throw from <b>Graham</b> <b>and</b> running 99 yards for a touchdown. He finished the season as the league leader in receptions and receiving yards as the Browns won another championship. His 67 catches and 1,146 receiving yards, in fact, were the second-best in pro football history after Don Hutson of the Green Bay Packers, who caught for 1,211 yards in 1940. Speedie was named by news outlets as a first-team All-Pro. Speedie's success in 1947 came as he, <b>Graham</b> <b>and</b> Lavelli gelled as a passing and receiving unit, having studied hours of tape and worked on their technique and coordination. Speedie studied how defensive backs moved their feet and tried to break into the open by exploiting mis-steps. They experimented with screen passes and made modifications to common receiving routes to exploit the weaknesses of defenses.|$|E
