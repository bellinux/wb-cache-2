The game was first proposed by series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi {{when he saw the}} Wii U hardware and the possibilities of the gamepad becoming the Camera Obscura. The game was a joint production effort between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo Software Planning & Development, with Kikuchi and fellow co-creator Makoto Shibata returning as to their respective posts of producer and director, together with staff from the previous series <b>entry</b> <b>Mask</b> of the Lunar Eclipse and developers new to the series. The cast went through several revisions during development, while the staff experimented with the capacities of the new hardware. As with previous games, it features a theme song by Tsuki Amano. Upon release, the game received mixed reviews. Reviewers greatly praised its use of the gamepad and dark atmosphere, while opinions were mixed on its story, portrayal of its female characters, and other aspects such as its pacing and controls.|$|E

40|$|Background In 2013, {{following}} reminders about statutory {{notification of}} HIV/AIDS, Portuguese clinicians notified all cases, irrespective of previous notification. At the same time, hospitals introduced electronic records that automatically generated additional paper notification reports. No supplemental resources {{were available to}} process the 10 -fold increase in notifications. The ensuing backlog caused delays in providing timely information for HIV program planning and evaluation. We investigated whether management principles from the automobile industry (LEAN) could improve data management efficiency. Methods Efficiency {{was defined as the}} time spent processing the paper report into electronic surveillance information. We used value stream mapping to understand the process and employed focus groups to identify areas for improvement (LEAN methodology). We recorded the time taken to complete this process for randomly selected batches of reports and calculated the average time per report. Results When consulted, stakeholders expressed the need for information about recent HIV/AIDS diagnoses. We prioritized processing cases diagnosed between 2011 - 2013. We reduced data-entry errors and transcribing time by inserting drop-down menus and automatic variable calculators. We implemented auto-search during data entry to prevent duplication. We redesigned the data <b>entry</b> <b>mask</b> to match the paper report. Before intervention, processing time was 9 minutes and 28 seconds (95 %CI 8 : 53 - 10 : 58) per report. Two months post-intervention, this was 6 minutes and 34 seconds (95 % CI 6 : 25 - 6 : 43), reducing the time to process the remaining backlog (10, 000 reports) by 54 days. Conclusion Applying LEAN techniques to HIV/AIDS surveillance in Portugal enabled delivery of crucial information to national and international HIV stakeholders through a 30 % reduction in data processing time and optimization of data quality. Public health practitioners should consider LEAN techniques to improve data quality and efficiency of surveillance systems...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{develop a}} {{questionnaire}} for measuring referring physician satisfaction and {{to conduct a}} pilot study in which this questionnaire is given to all physicians referring patients to the authors' radiology department. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After qualitative pre-testing and adjustment of the prototype questionnaire, data were collected using the finalized standardized questionnaire comprising 29 indicators rated on a 4 -point ordinal scale mailed with a personalized cover letter to the total referring physician population of a radiology department (n = 727). The replies, rated 1 - 4, were entered into a data <b>entry</b> <b>mask</b> for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The response rate was 33. 8 %. The indicators with the highest satisfaction rating were the range of examinations offered ("very satisfied": 79. 3 % mean 3. 79), {{the quality of the}} technical equipment used for MRI and CT (79. 3 %, 3. 79) and mammography (82. 5 %, 3. 82), {{and the quality of the}} images yielded by these procedures (74. 5 %, 3. 73 and 82. 2 %, 3. 83). Dissatisfaction was relatively high with the indicators "time to receipt of the written report" (28. 3 % "not very satisfied" or "not at all satisfied", mean 2. 97), "time to receipt of the X-ray images" (18. 2 %, 3. 07) and "availability of previous findings" (20. 9 %, 3. 05); satisfaction was higher among external referring physicians (p < 0. 05). Physicians rated the importance of these three indicators as relatively high ("very important": 62. 4 %, 54. 3 % and 49. 6 %). Other indicators showing a similar level of dissatisfaction were "car parking availability" (24. 1 %, 3. 01), "patient waiting time" (27. 4 %, 2. 87) and "patient environment" (21. 2 %, 2. 99), although these factors were rated as less important ("very important": 33. 0 %, 33. 7 % and 40. 4 %). CONCLUSION: This questionnaire constitutes a standardized validated instrument for assessing referring physician satisfaction with a radiology department. The data from this pilot study highlight areas for potential improvement. Deployment of such a questionnaire in different radiology departments could serve to establish best practice benchmarks...|$|E

Literary {{scholarship}} has always shown {{an interest in}} spatial dimensions and extensions of biographies, but it ascribed them a specific value. Pioneers of literary geography from the German linguistic area (Siegfried Robert Nagel and Josef Nadler) were mostly interested in the local, regional, national, or provincial origins of the authors, which {{is second only to}} the title of the work {{when it comes to the}} most commonly mapped literary-historical information. The province or geographical space was understood as the humus orbasis from which the authors and also the spiritual or literary achievements originate. Such a deterministic view of the space/place eased overtime, becoming only one of the factors that influence the development of the literary culture. Scholars such as Horst Dieter Schlosser started addressing other spatially bound datafor example, places of education, career, travels, publishing, or networking. Consequently, the manners of mapping have also changed: from the simple charts covered with transparent paper displaying literary monuments to more complicated-though not necessarily more explicit-biographical displays using a wide variety of cartographic symbols (from point marks to graphically more representative cartographic symbols such as the quaver). As a result of a project whose goal is to map the biographies of prominent Slovenian men of letters, this paper returns to a more basic manner of displaying biographies, using, say, point and linear display. In this sense, it is closer to the attempts from the beginning of the twentieth century. However, by using modern GIS technologies the project models cartographic displays according to the latest cartographic guidelines. Moreover, unlike the 1980 s attempts, the project emphasizes not individual trajectories, but, using corpus processing, the literary culture from the beginnings of Slovenian aesthetic production. This enables not only new findings about the spatial development of Slovenian literature, but also certain generalizations of these findings. The structure of the <b>entry</b> <b>mask</b> for biographies, which was constructed for the purposes of this project, is accordingly differentiated and in principle enables the collection and visualization of all spatially bound and statistically relevant literary-historical data. Thematic maps designed as analytical tools for a spatial analysis of literature will focus on individual objects, displaying the following spatially linked components of biographies: 1) the network of birthplaces 2) the network of the places of death 3) the network of secondary school locations 4) the network of secondary schools, which belong to the wider context of literary culture 5) career paths that must be considered when verifying the modes of mobility of the men of letters and the spatial extent of literary culture 6) the density of literary networks 7) the print media and presses that participated in consolidating literary activityand 8) individual literary memorial events.

40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that performing packet classifica-tion on a potentially large number of filters on key header fields is dif-ficult and has poor worst-case performance. To achieve fast packet clas-sification, hardware support is unavoidable. Ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM) has been widely used to perform fast packet clas-sification due to its ability {{to solve the problem}} in O(1) time without considering the number of <b>entries,</b> <b>mask</b> continuity and their lengths. As compared to the software-based solutions, the TCAM can offer sustained throughput and simple system architecture. It is attractive for packet classification, especially for the ultimate IPv 6 -based networks. However, it also comes with several shortcomings, such as the limited number of entries, expansive cost and power consumption. Accordingly, we propose an efficient algorithm to reduce the required TCAM by encoding the ad-dress portion of the searchable entries. The new scheme could encrypt the 128 -bit prefixes of the real-world IPv 6 routing tables into 11 bits and still keeps the property of CIDR. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{document}} two striking {{facts about}} U. S. firm dynamics and interpret their significance for aggregate employment dynamics. The first observation is the steady {{decline in the}} firm entry rate over the last thirty years, {{and the second is}} the gradual shift of employment from younger to older firms over the same period. Both observations hold across industries and geographies. We show that, despite these trends, firms' life-cycle dynamics and business-cycle properties have remained virtually unchanged. Consequently, the reallocation of employment toward older firms results entirely from the cumulative effect of the thirty-year decline in firm entry. This "start-up deficit" has both an immediate and a delayed (by shifting the age distribution) effect on aggregate employment dynamics. Recognizing this evolving heterogeneity is crucial for understanding shifts in aggregate behavior of employment over the business cycle. With mature firms less responsive to business cycle shocks, the cyclical component of aggregate employment growth diminishes with the increasing share of mature firms. At the same time, the trend decline in firm <b>entry</b> <b>masks</b> the diminishing cyclicality during contractions and reinforces it during expansions, which generates the appearance of jobless recoveries where aggregate employment recovers slowly relative to output...|$|R
40|$|Protocol Oblivious Forwarding (POF) aims at {{providing}} a standard southbound interface for sustainable Software Defined Networking (SDN) evolvement. It overcomes {{the limitations of}} popular Open Flow protocols (an existing widely-adopted southbound interface), through the enhancement of SDN forwarding plane. This paper pioneers the design and implementation of a Kernel-space POF Virtual Switch (K_POFVS) on Linux platform. K_POFVS can improve the packet processing speed, through fast packet forwarding and the capability of adding/deleting/modifying protocol fields in kernel space. In addition, {{it is able to}} enhance flow table matching speed, by separating the mask table (consisting of flow <b>entry</b> <b>masks</b> used to figure out the matching field) and the flow table under a caching mechanism. Furthermore, K_POFVS can achieve efficient communication between the kernel space and the user space, via extending the Netlink communication between them. Experimental results show that K_POFVS can provide much better performance than existing user-space POF virtual switches, in terms of packet forwarding delay, packet processing delay and packet transmission rateThis work is partially supported by the National Program on Key Basic Research Project of China (973 Program) under Grant No. 2012 CB 315803, the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences under grant No. XDA 06010306, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61303241, and the University of Exeter’s Innovation Platform – Link Fund under Award No. LF 207...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An {{internet}} protocol (IP) router determines the next hop for a packet by finding the longest prefix match. This lookup often occurs in ternary {{content addressable memory}} (TCAM), which allows bit masking of the IP address. In this paper, an in-ternet protocol content addressable memory (IPCAM) circuit that directly determines the longest prefix match to the stored address is described. The proposed IPCAM produces an encoded prefix match length that {{is limited by the}} prefix <b>mask.</b> <b>Entries</b> need not be sorted in order. One of the proposed IPCAM entries replaces on average 22 TCAM entries. Consequently the longest prefix matching CAM is less than 1 / 10 the size of the equivalent TCAM and dissipates 93. 5 % less dynamic power. The encoded outputs drive a priority encoder to determine the longest prefix match in the IPCAM arrays. A priority encoder circuit architecture appropriate to the unsorted IPCAM entries is also presented.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONPortable {{firearms}} have {{a relevant}} medico-legal interest, being {{a major cause}} of injury. Bullet entry wounds generally have a particular appearance, including contusion, skin introflection, and simple or excoriated ecchymosis. The skin wound is typically a hole with frayed margins, whose diameter is smaller than that of the bullet. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe report the case of a 19 -year-old man with ballistic trauma. Examination of the patient's lesions indicated that the bullet had entered from the left mandibular parasymphysis, creating a small hole without the typical bullet wipe and blackening. Subsequently, the bullet seemed to have fractured the left chin region immediately below the lower alveolar process, and it finally stopped in the submandibular area in the suprahyoid region of the neck. DISCUSSIONThis case is peculiar because the distinctive features of a firearm injury were absent; the lack of bleeding and edema made the case difficult to interpret without additional diagnostic investigations. CONCLUSIONBallistic trauma can manifest in different ways; therefore, internal trauma should be suspected {{even in the absence of}} clear external signs.
