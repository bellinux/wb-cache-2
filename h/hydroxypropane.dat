40|$|The {{tamarind}} based resin containing <b>hydroxypropane</b> {{sulphonic acid}} groups has been synthesized and their adsorption behavior for heavy metal ions {{has been investigated}} using batch and column experiments. The <b>hydroxypropane</b> sulphonic acid group has been incorporated onto tamarind by a modified Porath's method of functionalisation of polysaccharides. The tamarind <b>hydroxypropane</b> sulphonic acid (THPSA) resin can selectively remove of heavy metal ions, which are contained in industrial wastewater. The THPSA resin was characterized by FTIR and thermogravimetric analysis. The effects of various adsorption conditions, such as pH, treatment time and adsorbent dose were also investigated. The optimum adsorption condition was found at pH 6, 120 minutes of equilibrium time and 0. 1 gram of resin dose. The orders of distribution coefficient values were determined...|$|E
40|$|Holden and Diver (1) in 1935 {{reported}} {{the isolation of}} a potassium acid salt (C 7 H 9011 NK) from Spanish ergot, and an acid (C 6 H 8010) derived from this salt, {{that had not been}} reported before as constituents of ergot. The analysis and chemical properties of this acid led these authors to postulate the following structure for this substance, COOH. CHOH. C(OH) (COOH). C(0 H) 2. COOH (1, 1, 2, 3, tetrahydroxypropane 1, 2, 3, tricarboxylic acid). The proposed identity of this acid relates It structurally to citric acid, COOH. CHg. C(OH) (COOH). CH 2. COOH, (2 <b>hydroxypropane</b> 1, 2, 3, tricarboxylic acid), and for this reason, was named citergic acid, under which name it will be referre to. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The {{isobaric}} vapor liquid equilibria of {{the binary}} 1 propanol þ water, 2 propanol þ water, and 2 methyl 2 propanol (tert butanol) þ water systems were predicted using the conductor like screening model for realistic solvation (COSMO RS) method. The phase {{behavior of the}} 1 propanol/ 2 propanol/tert butanol þ water þ piperazine based Good’s buffer systems were predicted. The effect of piperazine containing Good’s buffers, 2 [4 (2 hydroxyethyl) piperazin 1 yl]alkanesulfonic acid, as mass separating agents on the separation of proponals from water were discussed. The influence of alkyl chain length between the zwitterion end groups, R ¼ methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, and decyl was evaluated. Further, the effect of 4 (2 hydroxyethyl) piperazine 1 (2 <b>hydroxypropane</b> sul fonic acid) was also evaluated. Piperazine based Good’s buffers {{are expected to be}} effective mass separating agents to have practical application in the separation of propanol from water...|$|E
40|$|This is the {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available at}} [URL] thin film composite (PA TFC) membranes are synthesized from interfacial polymerization using two amines in the aqueous phase. The conventional monomer, mphenelynediamine (MPD), is partially replaced by a linear monomer, 1, 3 –diamino- 2 - <b>hydroxypropane</b> (DAHP). The water permeability of the membranes improves by around 22 % (to 2. 67 ± 0. 09 L. m- 2. h- 1. bar- 1) while keeping the same high salt rejection (96 - 98 %) at an optimum DAHP/MPD ratio of 12. 8 %. While developing the control PA TFC membrane we introduce a washing step and show that the support surface should be free from surface protective coatings to achieve high water flux (2. 18 ± 0. 08 L. m- 2. h- 1. bar- 1). Incorporating DAHP units into the polyamide network improves the water flux through the membranes fabricated on both original and washed supports. The surface morphologies of polyamide films change significantly with introduction of DAHP, from large ridge-and-valley structure to enlarged nodular structures. High resolution SEM images show an ultrathin polyamide thin film with a thickness that is reduced with addition of DAHP. These influences of DAHP, namely {{a reduction in the}} selective layer thickness, an alteration in surface morphology, changes in internal molecular packing and hydrophilicity, are suggested as factors behind the improved water permeability. We would like to thank EPSRC grant, Schlumberger Faculty for the Future (FFTF) foundation and the Qatar National Research Fund for the research financial support...|$|E
