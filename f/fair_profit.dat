The video was released several weeks after the September 11, 2001 attacks, and was banned from MTV for the depictions of falling buildings. Roadrunner Records, expecting to make a <b>fair</b> <b>profit</b> from album promotions, dropped the band's funding, causing Machine Head to leave the label. At the same time the band was leaving Roadrunner, Luster departed from the band for musical differences.|$|E

50|$|The {{fifth and}} final {{criterion}} the regulator {{must take into}} account is fairness to the investors. This is a separate concern from the first criterion since the regulator must both ensure that the company receives the capital it needs to continue operating and that private investors are receiving <b>fair</b> <b>profits</b> on their investment, otherwise such regulation would likely correspond to a decrease in investment.|$|R

50|$|As {{the annual}} fair became more {{successful}} still, {{the right to}} control it {{became the subject of}} a battle between the town of Cambridge and its well-established University until in 1589 Elizabeth I confirmed the right of the town to collect the <b>fair's</b> <b>profit,</b> but controversially granted the University the right to oversee the organisation of the fair, as well as controlling quality. The once flourishing chapel became merely the store for the stalls, and in the eighteenth century was even used as a pub.|$|R

50|$|The Telugu {{version of}} Superstar which was {{released}} in Andhra Pradesh in 2003 (a year after its original Kannada release) was titled as Stupid - O Pichi Vadi Prema Katha and had a fantastic opening across Andhra Pradesh, owing mainly to Upendra's loyal Telugu fan following which he had gained due to the large success of the Telugu versions of his earlier blockbuster movies like A and Upendra (film) which not only starred him but were also directed by him, and a few straight Telugu movies like Raa and Kanyadanam which were box office hits. Although Superstar was just an average grosser in Karnataka, Stupid surprisingly {{turned out to be}} a hit in Andhra Pradesh by completing 100 days of run and its distributors in Andhra Pradesh earned <b>fair</b> <b>profits</b> from the movie.|$|R

60|$|Their reply came in due course.

Some days later found them in Topeka, where they had decided to rest up for a day or two.

The cost of washing gravel, sand, and clay did not exceed in our colonies 1d. to 2d. per ton; and thus the working expenses were so small that 4d. worth of gold to the ton of soft stuff paid a <b>fair</b> <b>profit.</b> Lastly, there is little danger to the miner; {{and this is an}} important consideration.|$|E

500|$|McCay {{resumed his}} old job as Deputy Chairman of the State Savings Bank of Victoria on 10 June 1919, {{a few days}} after he {{returned}} to Melbourne. He also resumed his relationship with Ella Gavan Duffy. On 30 December 1919, the Premier of Victoria, Harry Lawson, McCay's successor in Legislative Assembly seat of Castlemaine and a former student at Castlemaine Grammar and Scotch College, appointed McCay as chairman of the <b>Fair</b> <b>Profits</b> Commission, a consumer protection body set up to monitor prices and profits. After his term ended in 1921, he was appointed to the advisory board of the War Service Homes Scheme of the Repatriation Commission. He was also Chairman of its Disposals Board from 1921 to 1922. In 1922, the State Savings Bank of Victoria took over the construction of war service homes in Victoria. During the 1923 Victorian Police strike, Monash appointed McCay to create, and later command the Special Constabulary Force that was established to carry out police duties during the strike. [...] McCay ran this organisation from the Melbourne Town Hall, and later the Repatriation Department offices, which were made available rent free by the Commonwealth Government. [...] The Special Constabulary Force was wound up in May 1924.|$|R
6000|$|Why {{is it that}} {{commercial}} honesty has so seldom charms for women? A woman who would give away the last shawl from her back will insist on smuggling her gloves through the Custom-house! Who can make a widow understand that she should not communicate with her boy in the colonies under the dishonest cover of a newspaper? Is not the passion for cheap purchases altogether a female mania? And yet every cheap purchase,--every purchase made at a rate so cheap as to deny the vendor his <b>fair</b> <b>profit</b> is, in truth, a dishonesty;--a dishonesty to which the purchaser is indirectly a party. Would that women could be taught to hate bargains! How much less useless trash would there be in our houses, and how much fewer tremendous sacrifices in our shops! ...|$|E

How had I sold the goods? had I charged the prices {{mentioned}} in the invoice? what percentage had I put on for profit? {{and a lot of other}} things. I waited until they were all out of breath, and then I said I had not bothered about invoices. I knew pretty well the prices such things cost in England. I clapped on so much more for the expenses of the voyage and a <b>fair</b> <b>profit.</b> I could tell them what I had paid for the figs and the currants, and for some bags of Smyrna sponges I had bought, but as to the prices I had charged, it was too much to expect that I could carry them in my head. All I knew was I had paid for the things I had bought, I had paid all the port dues and other charges, I had advanced the men one-fourth of their wages each month, and I had brought them back the balance.|$|E
6000|$|I {{will even}} {{go so far}} as to affirm, that, if men were willing to serve in such {{situations}} without salary, they ought not to be permitted to do it. Ordinary service must be secured by the motives to ordinary integrity. I do not hesitate to say that that state which lays its foundation in rare and heroic virtues will be sure to have its superstructure in the basest profligacy and corruption. An honorable and <b>fair</b> <b>profit</b> is the best security against avarice and rapacity; as in all things else, a lawful and regulated enjoyment is the best security against debauchery and excess. For as wealth is power, so all power will infallibly draw wealth to itself by some means or other; and when men are left no way of ascertaining their profits but by their means of obtaining them, those means will be increased to infinity. This is true in all the parts of administration, as well as in the whole. If any individual were to decline his appointments, it might give an unfair advantage to ostentatious ambition over unpretending service; it might breed invidious comparisons; it might tend to destroy whatever little unity and agreement may be found among ministers. And, after all, when an ambitious man had run down his competitors by a fallacious show of disinterestedness, and fixed himself in power by that means, what security is there that he would not change his course, and claim as an indemnity ten times more than he has given up? ...|$|E
