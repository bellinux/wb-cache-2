There are three aspects to control: {{the degree of}} supersaturation, which <b>impacts</b> <b>the</b> density of the contrail; the relative humidity, which <b>impacts</b> <b>the</b> rate of dissipation; and the wind speed, which <b>impacts</b> <b>the</b> rate of spreading.

When a primary crater forms {{following}} a surface <b>impact,</b> <b>the</b> shock waves from <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> will cause <b>the</b> surface area around <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> circle to stress, forming a circular outer ridge around <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> circle. Ejecta from this initial impact is thrust upward out of <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> circle {{at an angle}} toward the surrounding area of <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> ridge. This ejecta blanket, or broad area of <b>impacts</b> from <b>the</b> ejected material, surrounds the crater.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of corporate governance and financial leverage {{on the value}} of American firms. This study also seeks to extend the findings of Gill and Mathur (2011 a). A sample of 333 firms listed on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for a period of 3 years from 2009 - 2011 was selected. The co-relational and non-experimental research design was used to conduct this study. Overall, findings show that larger board size negatively <b>impacts</b> <b>the</b> value of American firms, and CEO duality, audit committee, financial leverage, firm size, return on assets, and insider holdings positively <b>impact</b> <b>the</b> value of American firms. <b>The</b> <b>impact</b> of corporate governance and financial leverage differs between manufacturing and service industries. Results show that board size negatively <b>impacts</b> <b>the</b> value of American manufacturing firms, and CEO duality, audit committee, financial leverage, firm size, and insider holdings positively <b>impact</b> <b>the</b> value of American manufacturing firms. Findings also show that board size negatively <b>impacts</b> <b>the</b> value of American service firms, and financial leverage and return on assets positively <b>impact</b> <b>the</b> value of American service firms. This study contributes to the literature on the factors that affect firm value. The findings may be useful for financial managers, investors, and financial management consultants...|$|R

5000|$|Coup injury may {{be caused}} when, during an <b>impact,</b> <b>the</b> skull is {{temporarily}} bent inward and <b>impacts</b> <b>the</b> brain. When the skull bends inward, it may set the brain into motion, causing it to collide with {{the opposite side of}} the skull; this will result in a contrecoup injury. The injuries can also be caused solely by acceleration or deceleration, in the absence of an impact. In injuries associated with acceleration or deceleration but with no <b>impact,</b> <b>the</b> brain is thought to bounce off the inside of the skull and hit the opposite side, potentially resulting in both coup and contrecoup injuries. [...] In addition to the skull, the brain may also <b>impact</b> <b>the</b> tentorium, causing a coup injury. Contrecoup injury may be produced by tensile forces.|$|R
