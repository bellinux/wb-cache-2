5|$|Walt Disney Imagineering (WDI) built animatronic WALL-E's {{to promote}} the picture, which made {{appearances}} at Disneyland Resort, the Franklin Institute, the Miami Science Museum, the Seattle Center, and the Tokyo International Film Festival. Due to safety concerns, the 318kg robots were always strictly controlled and WDI always needed to <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were required to interact with. For this reason, they generally refused to have their puppets meet and greet children at the theme parks in case a WALL-E trod on a child's foot. Those who {{wanted to take a}} photograph with the character had to make do with a cardboard cutout.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{meanings}} of the terms associated with the separation axioms has varied over time, as explained in History of the separation axioms. It {{is important to understand}} the authors' definition of each condition mentioned to <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean, especially when reading older literature.|$|E
25|$|Four newly raised ranging companies, {{have all}} been organized, and taken their several {{stations}} on our frontier. We are much pleased. We know they are true men, and they <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are about. With many of them Indian and Mexican fighting has been their trade for years. That they may be permanently retained in the service on our frontier is extremely desirable, and we cannot permit ourselves to doubt such will be the case.|$|E
60|$|He {{gave them}} some further instructions, and {{half an hour}} had slipped by before he seemed {{satisfied}} that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were to do; then he nodded.|$|R
60|$|The {{storekeeper}} {{was pleased}} to serve them, especially {{when he realized that}} their purchases would be for cash. Jack and the others <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted, and picked out everything with care.|$|R
5000|$|Detectives {{investigating}} the robbery stated: [...] "They <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{were looking for}} and we suspect they already had a market for the jewels." [...] The suspects' details were circulated to all ports and airports but police believed they would have an elaborately prepared escape route and had already left the country.|$|R
25|$|Stock Rotation is the {{practice}} of changing the way inventory is displayed on a regular basis. This is most commonly used in hospitality and retail - particularity where food products are sold. For example, {{in the case of}} supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis, the customer may <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want and where it is. This results in many customers going straight to the product they seek and do not look at other items on sale. To discourage this practice, stores will rotate the location of stock to encourage customers to look through the entire store. This is in hopes the customer will pick up items they would not normally see.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Night School Studio did not <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{wanted the}} music of Oxenfree to sound like. American film, TV, and game music {{composer}} and sound designer Andrew Rohrmann, known under his alias scntfc, composed the music and sound design of the game; Krankel knew Rohrmann from {{a friend of a}} friend and had not known of his game music pedigree. Hines mentioned that they gave Rohrmann [...] "random" [...] suggestions for the sound, including [...] "John Carpenter meets Boards of Canada", but were impressed with the music they got in response.|$|E
500|$|He {{stressed}} that the financial administration's transparency differs enormously between countries; especially the non-transparent monarchies may be much more expensive than is publicly known. This means comparing them to republics, especially the very transparent administration of France where citizens can <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> pay for, may be unfair. In a 2015 interview with NRC Handelsblad, Matthijs commented that the then-known €7.7 million allotted to the royal house in Spain's national budget was 'unbelievable': [...] "I can't find out more, but I understand from the media that the total expenses of the Spanish house may {{be as much as}} 80 million." ...|$|E
25|$|Newspaper columnists {{subsequently}} exchanged mixed {{views about}} The Jeremy Kyle Show. Fiona Phillips, {{writing in the}} Daily Mirror, accused Judge Berg of being out of touch and claimed those appearing on the programme <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were letting themselves in for. However, Carole Malone at sister publication the Sunday Mirror claimed Kyle was only interested in helping his own ego.|$|R
5000|$|Another take is {{the review}} on CinemaEye which gives it 4 stars with the comment [...] "CROMARTIE HIGH SCHOOL doesn't make sense whatsoever. That {{is the true}} charm of it. The team behind this <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing. Extremely {{entertaining}} on every level if you just roll with it. It is too bizarre but they sure make you laugh." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In {{the weeks}} and months after September 11, I had so many {{people come up to me}} and say how glad they were that George Bush and Dick Cheney were in the White House. I <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> meant. These men are strong, they are steadfast, they are exactly the leaders we need at this moment in our history." [...] —Lynne Cheney ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Next, the Federal Works Agency, {{no doubt}} pressed hard by other eager outstretched hands, sought still {{additional}} methods of getting defense housing done. Some money was {{made available to}} the Farm Security Administration, to the Tennessee Valley Authority, and within the FWA itself another unit was set up, the Mutual Ownership Division of Defense Housing, under Col. Westbrook. I don't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do, sir." ...|$|E
2500|$|E-ring/P-ring: {{short for}} [...] "equatorial ring" [...] or [...] "polar ring" [...] respectively. The rings {{described}} are not solid, but rather {{similar to the}} rings around Jupiter or Saturn: {{hundreds of thousands of}} large individual solid elements, built and occupied by the post-humans before Caliban and Prospero were stranded there and Caliban began murdering the post-humans. The rings are visible from the Earth's surface, but the old-style humans do not <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} date had shifted to winter 2000, {{similarities}} were noted between {{the film and}} DreamWorks Animation's The Road to El Dorado. Marc Lument, a visual development artist on El Dorado, claimed [...] "It really was a race, and Katzenberg wanted ours out before theirs." [...] Lument also added that, [...] "We didn't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing, but we had the impression {{it was going to}} be very similar. Whoever came out second would face the impression that they copied the other." [...] Fullmer and Dindal denied the similarities with the latter commenting [...] "This version [...] was well in the works when that movie came out," [...] and further added [...] "Early on, when our movie got to be very comic, all of us felt that you can't be making this farce about a specific group of people unless we are going to poke fun at ourselves. This didn't seem to be a proper choice about Incas or any group of people. It was more of a fable." ...|$|E
500|$|There was a {{negative}} fan {{reaction to the}} design of Enterprise, and criticism of the efforts of Drexler and the other designers. When questioned about this, Geoffrey Mandall stated in an interview, [...] "Having been around then, I also know that Doug Drexler and John Eaves did <b>EXACTLY</b> <b>what</b> the producers asked them to: Rick and Braga had very strong opinions, and <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{very easy}} to slip into the way of {{anything}} you like," [...] she answered. [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{were going to do}} to Captain Graham, and I got there before them. When they searched him, the formula had gone. Fischer caught my steamer and worried me all the way over. He thought he had us in a corner last night, and then a miracle happened." ...|$|R
50|$|The Treaties {{were signed}} {{during a period}} of severe {{cultural}} destruction in which the Songhees had experienced precipitous population decline, due to the arrival of foreign diseases. The Treaties remain highly controversial given that it is unclear whether the Aboriginal leaders <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were signing over, and given that the HBC took advantage of the recent cultural destruction by offering fairly inconsequential in exchange for large and highly valuable land purchases.|$|R
6000|$|... "He tried to. But {{they held}} him to some agreement-- I don't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what.</b> <b>They</b> {{wanted to get}} more money out of him-- if they could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They're very happy!" [...] said Mrs. Thornbury, looking benignantly after them. Rachel agreed; {{they seemed}} to be so certain of themselves; {{they seemed to}} <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Britling had a {{recurrence}} of that same disagreeable fancy that these young people didn't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were going into. He wished he was in khaki himself; then he fancied this compunction wouldn't trouble him quite so much.|$|E
3000|$|I lost sensitivity, I {{got through}} the audition. They told me I did—it’s all anonymous, but the people {{recognised}} my playing—said I’d played really well. I thought I’d probably done worse than I really had. A part of my problem was I’d sat behind those audition screens before. I’ve been on the other side, so I knew the whole process. I <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were thinking, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were looking for so I—in a sense going back on it, I had the cards stacked against me before it I walked into the friggin’ room… [...]...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} Marion Raven said their songs were always {{about their experiences}} and thoughts, and that this album's songs were [...] "mostly about love," [...] though also touched on jealousy and how they see the world. She also said that while their first album was about finding out who they were as everything about recording was new to them, on The Big Room <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted, stating [...] "We {{wanted to make a}} 'real' album. With a live band in the studio, with our songs and a producer we knew would listen to our ideas." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 51 years later, in 2047 (2042 in the Japanese versions), a {{breed of}} {{artificial}} life-forms or bioroids known as [...] "Snatchers" [...] began {{appearing in the}} artificial island of Neo Kobe City, killing their victims and taking their place in society. Nobody <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are or where they come from. As Gillian Seed, an amnesiac working for an Anti-Snatcher task force called J.U.N.K.E.R., the player's goal is {{to track down the}} source of the Snatchers and discover Gillian's mysterious connections with them. The story takes place in three acts, with Act 3 existing only in the CD-ROM releases.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} that the obvious people are not the most fortunate," [...] he said, with a little laugh. [...] "They <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want, which not {{infrequently}} means that {{what they have to do}} to get it is equally plain. It must necessarily save them a good many perplexities. Now take the case of my very obvious comrade, Ingleby." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> will be," [...] Fenn pointed out. [...] "The trouble, of course, is {{that the}} missing packet {{contains}} the signature of the three guarantors. The packet, no doubt, {{will be in the}} hands of the Foreign Office by to-morrow. The Prime Minister can verify our statements. We present our ultimatum a little sooner than we intended, but we get our blow in first and we are ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Adieu! my best, my only beloved!' ejaculated {{the unhappy}} Queen; 'do not forget {{me for a}} moment; and let {{nothing in the world}} induce you to speak to any of those horrid people. I know them; I <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> will be at: the moment I am gone they will {{commence}} their intrigues for the restoration of the reign of doom and torture. Do not listen to them, my Pluto. Sooner than have recourse to them, seek assistance from their former victims.' ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1885, {{an effort}} was made to beautify the area to the east of the station itself with {{ornamental}} gardens. The embankment along Stuart Street provided an opportunity to let passengers passing by to <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> city <b>they</b> were in, with the word [...] "Hamilton" [...] written with white stones.|$|R
2500|$|Stewart {{notes that}} Bell was [...] "both more lively and more honest" [...] than {{political}} statements in his time. He quotes six examples of her writing, the shortest {{of which is}} [...] "No one <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do want, least of all themselves, except that they don’t want us." [...] He quotes Bell's colleague, T.E. Lawrence (of Arabia), as saying that she was [...] "not a good judge of men or situations", and observes that [...] "If there was no ideal solution, however, there were still clear mistakes. Bell should never have acquiesced in {{the inclusion of the}} Kurdish-dominated province of Mosul in Iraq." [...] However, Stewart praises her 1920 White Paper, comparing it to General Petraeus's report to the US Congress.|$|R
50|$|The {{drivers were}} mainly {{recruited}} from the British and Dutch Communist parties and were brave {{young men and women}} who <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing, and that they would have to look after the paying tourists between Kenya and South Africa, as well as collecting the weapons in Lusaka, Zambia and driving the load safely to a camp site near Johannesburg or Cape Town. The most dangerous part of their journey would begin here when the drivers would unload the steel containers of weapons out from the secret compartments in the truck and into smaller passenger vehicles. These would be driven to drop off areas where unidentified operatives of the ANC would collect and further distribute or strategically bury the weapons.|$|R
60|$|It {{was curious}} {{to listen to}} the various hints and opinings thrown out by the sailors at the {{occasional}} glimpses they had of this collection of silks, velvets, broadcloths, and satins. I do not <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> thought Harry had been; but they seemed unanimous in believing that, by abandoning his country, Harry had left more room for the gamblers. Jackson even asked him to lift up the lower hem of his browsers, to test the color of his calves.|$|E
60|$|Women, as a rule, are stancher than men. There {{are women}} {{that you feel}} you could rely upon to the death. But very few men indeed have this dog-like virtue. Men, taking them generally, are more like cats. You may live with them and call them yours for twenty years, but you can never feel quite sure of them. You never <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are {{thinking}} of. You never feel easy in your mind as to {{the result of the}} next-door neighbor's laying down a Brussels carpet in his kitchen.|$|E
6000|$|... "We may expect 'em any time, now," [...] {{the hunter}} answered. [...] "The Injuns' time of attack is {{generally}} just before dawn, {{but they know}} well enough they aint likely to ketch us asleep any time, and, as they <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{have got to do}} they'll gain nothing by waiting. I wish we had a moon; if we had, we might keep 'em out of the stockade. But there--it's just as well it's dark, after all; for, if the moon was up, the young ones would have no chance of getting away." ...|$|E

5000|$|One {{practical}} {{application of the}} ICS {{is that all of}} the standardized messages come in nine languages (English, French, Italian, German, Japanese, Spanish, Norwegian, and, since 1969, Russian and Greek). This fact is immaterial if the sender and receiver(s) are using different languages; each language has a book with equivalent messages keyed to the same code. This is also useful in radiotelephony, or even when ships are within hailing distance, if there is no common language: a crewman on a burning ship yells [...] "yuliett alfa vour", and a vessel coming to their aid <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> need — [...] "material for foam fire extinguishers" [...] (that is, the foaming agent). (See :de:Flaggenalphabet for the German version of single-letter signals.) ...|$|R
60|$|The sculptor, or {{the people}} who had ordered this stone figure, had evidently been very much pleased with it, for little copies of it, also in stone, had been placed here and there along the sides of the church, not very far from the ground, so that people could easily look at them, and ponder on their curious forms. There were a great many other sculptures on the outside of this church,--saints, martyrs, {{grotesque}} heads of men, beasts, and birds, {{as well as those of}} other creatures which cannot be named, because nobody <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were; but none were so curious and interesting as the great griffin over the door, and the little griffins on the sides of the church.|$|R
