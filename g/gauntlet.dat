5|$|The Sole Survivor investigates a pre-War {{amusement}} park, Nuka-World, when radio advertisements are broadcast {{into the}} Commonwealth. Porter Gage, a veteran raider, contacts the Sole Survivor after boarding a monorail and tells {{them that they}} are walking into a death trap. Upon arrival, the Sole Survivor must navigate an increasingly-deadly obstacle course called the <b>Gauntlet,</b> which culminates in a fight with the raider leader, Overboss Colter. Gage reveals that the fight is rigged as Colter is wearing invulnerable electrically-charged armor, and that no-one survives the <b>Gauntlet.</b> Gage aids the Sole Survivor by helping them exploit the Achilles heel in Colter's armor, becoming the first person to survive the <b>Gauntlet.</b> Following the death of Colter, Gage explains the leaders of the three raider gangs conspired to usurp him, using the broadcast and the <b>Gauntlet</b> to find possible replacements. The Sole Survivor is offered to become the Overboss, but must balance the competing needs of each gang of raiders while conquering the outlying areas of the park. Once the entire park is under raider control, the Sole Survivor sets about expanding raider influence in the Commonwealth by conquering settlements, restoring power to Nuka-World to make the park self-sufficient, and thwarting attempts by the Gunnersa band of amoral mercenariesto seize control of Nuka-World for themselves.|$|E
5|$|The raiding {{forces were}} mostly {{provided}} by the British Commandos, but the two largest raids, Operation <b>Gauntlet</b> and Operation Jubilee, drew heavily on Canadian troops. The size of the raiding force depended on the objective. The smallest raid was two men from No. 6 Commando in Operation J V. The largest raid involved over 10,500 men in Operation Jubilee. Most of the raids were scheduled to only last overnight, but some, like Operation <b>Gauntlet,</b> were conducted {{over a number of}} days.|$|E

50|$|Historically, <b>gauntlets</b> {{were used}} by {{soldiers}} and knights.
