5|$|Cotto's third {{championship}} defense {{took place}} on September 24, 2005 at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, against Ricardo Torres of Colombia. In the first round Cotto had an offensive advantage and scored a <b>knockdown</b> on Torres. In the second round after trading hits Torres scored a <b>knockdown</b> on Miguel. The last seconds of the round were evenly matched with both boxers finishing the round injured. Cotto was apparently in better condition when the third round began and was dominating the fight at that point. With two minutes remaining in the round one of Cotto's punches landed in Torres' beltline. Following this Torres was granted thirty seconds to recover by the referee. Cotto dominated the fourth round and Torres won the fifth. Cotto won and scored a <b>knockdown</b> in the sixth round. At 1:24 of the seventh round a left hook by Cotto knocked Torres out.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to safety}} {{concerns}} with viral vectors, nonviral delivery methods, typically employing lipid-based or polymeric vectors, are also promising candidates. Computational modeling of nonviral siRNA delivery paired with in vitro and in vivo gene <b>knockdown</b> studies elucidated the temporal behavior of RNAi in these systems. The model used an input bolus dose of siRNA and computationally and experimentally showed that <b>knockdown</b> duration was dependent {{mainly on the}} doubling time of the cells to which siRNA was delivered, while peak <b>knockdown</b> depended primarily on the delivered dose. Kinetic considerations of RNAi are imperative to safe and effective dosing schedules as nonviral methods of inducing RNAi continue to be developed.|$|E
5|$|It {{appeared}} that Judah scored a <b>knockdown</b> {{in the second}} round when Mayweather's glove touched the canvas; however, referee Richard Steele ruled it a slip.|$|E

5|$|Morpholinos {{have become}} a {{standard}} <b>knockdown</b> tool in animal embryonic systems, which have {{a broader range of}} gene expression than adult cells and can be strongly affected by an off-target interaction. Following initial injections into frog or fish embryos at the single-cell or few-cell stages, Morpholino effects can be measured up to five days later, after most of the processes of organogenesis and differentiation are past, with observed phenotypes consistent with target-gene <b>knockdown.</b> Control oligos with irrelevant sequences usually produce no change in embryonic phenotype, evidence of the Morpholino oligo's sequence-specificity and lack of non-antisense effects. The dose required for a <b>knockdown</b> can be reduced by coinjection of several Morpholino oligos targeting the same mRNA, which is an effective strategy for reducing or eliminating dose-dependent off-target RNA interactions.|$|E
5|$|On February 5, 2005, Judah {{would get}} a rematch with Spinks at the Savvis Center in St. Louis, Missouri, Spinks' hometown. The fight {{was the first major}} bout in St. Louis in more than 40years, and it was a sellout. Judah was the aggressor {{throughout}} the fight.

Judah pressed the attack after the first <b>knockdown</b> and avoided Spinks' desperate efforts to tie him up. After Spinks was knocked down for the second time, the referee stopped the fight, and Judah became the new Undisputed Welterweight Champion.|$|E
