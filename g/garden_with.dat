5|$|From Beckford's {{house in}} Lansdown Crescent {{to the tower}} a series of {{interlinked}} gardens were laid out which became known as Beckford's Ride. Nearest the crescent was a terraced Italianate garden and then a plantation of conifers. Above the plantation was a quarry garden and dyke garden before entering a grotto tunnel under a track. The tunnel lead into the tower garden. Specialist planting included: Pinus arborea, Royal Fern (Osmunda regalis) and Cistus alpina. These were to encourage bird species including nightingales, linnets and thrushes. The old quarry {{was made into a}} walled <b>garden</b> <b>with</b> fruit and vegetables.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Margaret Chaloner, {{wife of the}} first Lord Gisborough, laid out formal gardens of a typical late-Victorian and Edwardian design with {{elaborate}} bedding schemes and gravelled paths. There was a rose garden and a sunken Italian <b>garden</b> <b>with</b> an ornamental pool at its centre. They were {{open to the public}} for a small fee and could be entered through a gateway on Bow Street. The gardens are now freely accessible.|$|E

5|$|The Billy Liddell Memorial Group {{formed in}} 2007 to {{advocate}} further recognition for Liddell, specifically {{in his home}} village of Townhill, and secure induction into the Scottish FA's Hall of Fame. A petition to the Scottish Parliament, to have Liddell inducted, succeeded in November 2008 when {{he became one of}} eight players admitted. His village renamed its sports complex in his honour and completed a memorial <b>garden,</b> <b>with</b> cairn, in May 2010. The Deputy Provost of Fife Council, Councillor Lizz Mogg, officially unveiled the cairn on the 22nd in the presence of Liddell's widow and other relatives. The memorial group announced its intention to disband in July, citing the success of its campaign.|$|E
5|$|The ballet {{was staged}} by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1911 at the Royal Opera, Covent <b>Garden,</b> <b>with</b> Tamara Karsavina and Nijinsky as Giselle and Albrecht.

The English loved Giselle. In 1942, for example, three {{different}} companies were dancing the ballet in London.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} {{requested that}} the city engineer produce a design for a memorial <b>garden</b> <b>with</b> an archway and a cenotaph. The city engineer reported back with a design which he estimated would cost around £7,000 and the war memorial committee appointed Lutyens to oversee the project. Lutyens had recently been commissioned to design a memorial for the North Eastern Railway Company (NER) which was based in York and planned to erect its own memorial in the city dedicated to those of its staff who fought and died in the war.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Meehan & Sons of Philadelphia {{designed}} the English Garden in 1910. It was first {{known as the}} Wisteria Garden. In 1925, Ninah attended a lecture on azaleas given by H. Harold Hume, a horticulturist known for his work with azaleas, camellias, and citrus. This lecture sparked her interest in azaleas, so she visited azalea gardens in Charleston, South Carolina for inspiration. Advised by Hume, she replanted much of her English <b>garden</b> <b>with</b> them, renaming it the Azalea Garden.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{have only}} had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team's foundation. It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 {{and for the first}} 28 years of its {{existence}} it was used almost exclusively by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market <b>garden)</b> <b>with</b> the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5acre (51,000m²) site. Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald Leitch, who had also designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park. Most football clubs were founded first, and then sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Historically, the Bedford Estate {{defined the}} {{boundary}} of Covent <b>Garden,</b> <b>with</b> Drury Lane to the east, the Strand to the south, St Martin's Lane to the west, and Long Acre to the north. However, over time the area regarded as part of Covent Garden has expanded northwards past Long Acre to High Holborn. Since 1971, {{with the creation of}} the Covent Garden Conservation Area which incorporated part of the area between St Martin's Lane and Charing Cross Road, Charing Cross Road has sometimes been taken as its western boundary. Long Acre is the main thoroughfare, running north-east from St Martin's Lane to Drury Lane. Shelton Street, running parallel to the north of Long Acre, marks the London borough boundary between Camden and Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{moved into}} the Führerbunker on 16 January 1945. He was joined by his senior staff, {{including}} Martin Bormann. In April 1945, Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels {{moved into the}} Führerbunker while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper Vorbunker. Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler's secretaries (including Traudl Junge), a nurse named Erna Flegel, and telephone switchboard operator Sergeant Rochus Misch. Early on, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study. Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before going {{back down into the}} bunker complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery <b>garden</b> <b>with</b> his dog Blondi. The bunker was crowded and the atmosphere was oppressive; air raids occurred daily. Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep. Conferences took place for much of the night, often until 05:00.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s {{during the}} American Civil War, housing for {{a battery of}} four field {{artillery}} pieces was constructed {{at the tip of}} the peninsula. It was used to defend a prison for Confederate soldiers on nearby Johnson's Island. Louis Zistel, a German immigrant, built two boats to transport the prisoners. In 1870, he began to ferry locals to the Cedar Point peninsula, which was regaining popularity as a summer picnic destination. Zistel opened a bathhouse on the north shore of the peninsula and the same year built a beer <b>garden</b> <b>with</b> a small dance floor. He charged 25 cents per person to ride from Sandusky to Cedar Point on his boat, Young Reindeer. This marked the beginning of commercial tourism on the Cedar Point peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the estate}} had been managed as a coppiced woodland, giving Robinson the {{opportunity}} to plant drifts of scilla, cyclamen, and narcissus between the coppiced hazels and chestnuts. On the edges, and in the cleared spaces in the woods, Robinson established plantings of Japanese anemone, lily, acanthus, and pampas grass, along with shrubs such as fothergilla, stewartia, and nyssa. Closer to the house he had some flower beds; throughout he planted red valerian, which he allowed to spread naturally around paving and staircases. Robinson planted thousands of daffodils annually, including 100,000 narcissi planted along one of the lakes in 1897. Over the years he added hundreds of trees, some of them from American friends John Singer Sargent and Frederick Law Olmsted. Other features included an oval-shaped walled kitchen garden, a heather garden, and a water <b>garden</b> <b>with</b> {{one of the largest}} collections of water lilies in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Original to the house, and occupying its {{northwest}} terrace {{against its}} service wing, was an Italian <b>garden</b> <b>with</b> vine-clad pergolas on each side, symmetrical gravel paths, marble benches, and long stone balustrades, giving it {{characteristics of a}} hanging garden. The garden was below the house's first floor, and was built against the hillside, occupying {{a portion of the}} slope that falls far below it. The lower walls of the house were screened with a row of large cedars planted on the highest part of the garden. The garden formed an immense rectangular space, and on the four sides of the terrace there were pergolas thickly overgrown with vines. In the center was a pool and a carved stone fountain imported from Rome. Walks and beds of flowers and shrubbery occupied the rest, visible from the west-facing windows of the house.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{gardens and}} {{pleasure}} grounds are situated {{close to the}} house, with an area of informal pleasure grounds extending to the south-east. Two features are the Cedar Walk and the Lime Walk, both majestic avenues {{to the south of}} the house, as well as a plantation known as Blind Wood. There is a terrace {{in front of the house}} with urns and vases, overlooking an extensive lawned area. Other features include a Victorian fernery and a sunken garden. To the west of the house, there is a rose <b>garden</b> <b>with</b> a central circular lawn. The kitchen garden lies to the south of the pleasure grounds and is now a commercial nursery. The house and gardens are open to the public and in 2012 received about 230,000 visitors.|$|E
