40|$|A fully grouted {{cable bolt}} is {{normally}} loaded at rock joints {{by a combination}} of the axial and shear forces causing both axial extension and shear deformation of the cable. The proposed analyses presented here attempts to predict the joint shear strength and shear displacement. The analyses are based on the statically indeterminate beam theory and some basic findings and conclusions of other researchers. Parametrical investigation is performed on four influence factors including bolt pretension, joint friction angle, concrete strength and bolt installation angle. Although the true plastic moduli of the cable bolt <b>deflecting</b> <b>section</b> at failure are the essential parameters in this analysis, they are practically impossible to determine. Thus, the average cable moduli obtained from the cable tensile strength tests were used. The proposed analytical model was compared with the experimental results, showing a good agreement. This analytical work aims to develop a simple tool for the practicing geotechnical engineer to effectively evaluate the cable shear behaviour and the influence of fully grouted cable bolts on joint shear resistance...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{patented}} self-tensioning {{system for}} long-span wooden structural floors is described {{that increases the}} performance of the <b>deflected</b> <b>sections</b> in terms of both resistance and deformation. The system is based on a force multiplier mechanism composed by two connecting rods which are secured to a post-stressing tendon. The mechanical device is activated by the transmission of the load from the structural element to the supports, causing an elongation and stressing the tendon. This transmission comes with a slight vertical displacement of the supports. Throughout this system, the intensity of the tensioning force varies with the applied load; thus, a more favorable bending moment distribution from the load is obtained, and the relative deformations of the different sections of the piece are reduced. This article presents a comparative study of the structural behavior of π-shape cross section wooden structural floors with spans from 9 m to 18 m, comparing sections with and without pre-stress, and sections with the self-tensioning system...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution {{measurement}} of the longitudinal profile of a relativistic electron beam is of utmost importance for linac based free-electron lasers and other advanced accelerator facilities that employ ultrashort bunches. In this paper, we investigate a novel scheme to measure ultrashort bunches (subpicosecond) with exceptional temporal resolution (hundreds of attoseconds) and dynamic range. The scheme employs two orthogonally oriented <b>deflecting</b> <b>sections.</b> The first imparts a short-wavelength (fast temporal resolution) horizontal angular modulation on the beam, while the second imparts a long-wavelength (slow) angular kick in the vertical dimension. Both modulations are observable on a standard downstream screen {{in the form of}} a streaked sinusoidal beam structure. We demonstrate, using scaled variables in a quasi- 1 D approximation, an expression for the temporal resolution of the scheme and apply it to a proof-of-concept experiment at the UCLA Neptune high-brightness injector facility. The scheme is also investigated for application at the SLAC NLCTA facility, where we show that the subfemtosecond resolution is sufficient to resolve the temporal structure of the beam used in the echo-enabled free-electron laser. We employ beam simulations to verify the effect for typical Neptune and NLCTA parameter sets and demonstrate the feasibility of the concept...|$|R
40|$|The {{alignment}} of single mode optical fibres using thermally actuated cantilever platforms is investigated. These devices F {{depend on their}} operation on differential thermal expansion of materials. An analysis and modeling of these thermal microactuators for fibre alignment purposes is discussed. The simulation results of microactuator deflection and the 4 coupling losses of single mode fibres by using the designed Pi-Shape microactuator are presented. By setting {{the length of the}} beam to 3 mm and the length of the <b>deflecting</b> cantilever <b>section</b> to 2 mm, the fibre-to-fibre coupling loss is only 0. 315 dB...|$|R
30|$|Impact lithotripters (pneumatic, {{electrokinetic}} and ultrasonic) {{are considered}} to be efficient and safe. However, their application is limited to rigid endoscopes and their use in the proximal ureter (Martov et al. 1998;Santa-Cruz et al. 1998) is restricted due to stone migration. Laser and electrohydraulic are efficient lithotripsy methods (Martov et al. 1998;Devarajan et al. 1998;Yang & Hong 1996) that can be also used via actively deflectable, flexible endoscopes in all locations in the urinary tract. Electrohydraulic/laser lithotripsy probes have small diameters of 1.9 Fr./ 1.3 - 1.5 Fr. that allow high irrigation flow through the endoscope working channel and {{that can be used in}} all sections of the ureter, pelvis and calyx (Devarajan et al. 1998;Yang & Hong 1996;Grasso & Bagley 1998;Marks & Teichman 2007;Elashry et al. 1996). However, electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL) has a higher complication rate because the high intensity electrohydraulic shock wave that is generated can cause tissue damage when used in close proximity to the urothelium. A ureteric perforation rate of 17.6 % is reported for EHL (Martov et al. 1998). It was for this reason that EHL has been widely abandoned, especially for use in the ureter where a safe distance cannot be maintained. Laser lithotripsy is safer than EHL but still is more expensive and provides slower disintegration (Yang & Hong 1996;Grasso & Bagley 1998;Marks & Teichman 2007;Elashry et al. 1996). Frequent damage to flexible ureterorenoscopes due to laser fiber breakage inside the <b>deflected</b> <b>section</b> of the flexible endoscope is a big drawback of laser lithotripsy.|$|R
40|$|In {{a direct}} tension test, {{unnotched}} specimens of quasibrittle materials that exhibit post-peak strain softening do not deform symmetrically. The equilibrium path bifurcates and the thermodynamic criterion of stable path requires the specimen to flex to one side, {{even if the}} geometry is perfect and if the straightening effect of {{the moment of the}} axial force about the centroid of the <b>deflected</b> cross <b>section</b> is taken into account. In absence of rotational restraints at the ends, the specimen fails right after the peak load. But if the attachments to the loading machine exert a sufficient restraint against rotation, the flexing to the side is retarded and failure occurs at midlength. The phenomenon (which is similar to the recently discovered behavior of notched tensile fracture specimens) is illustrated using a simple model in which the specimen consists of two bars of unequal length, joined by a strain-softening link...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the inter-relation between enamel morphology and crack resistance by sectioning extracted human molars after loading to fracture. Cracks appear to initiate from tufts, hypocalcified defects at the enamel–dentin junction, and grow longitudinally around the enamel coat to produce failure. Microindentation corner cracks placed {{next to the}} tufts in the <b>sections</b> <b>deflect</b> along the tuft interfaces and occasionally penetrate into the adjacent enamel. Although they constitute weak interfaces, the tufts are nevertheless filled with organic matter, and appear to be stabilized against easy extension by self-healing, {{as well as by}} mutual stress-shielding and decussation, accounting at least in part for the capacity of tooth enamel to survive high functional forces...|$|R
50|$|The FK-3 was {{designed}} by Otto Funk to be a high performance sailplane, particularly suited to weak thermal conditions but also easy to fly. It is a largely metal pod and boom aircraft, with cantilever shoulder wings. The wing has a thickness/chord ratio of 15.3% and a simple straight tapered plan with square tips, built around a single spar. It made use of plastic foams, both in the light alloy-foam sandwich ribs and with a rigid foam honeycomb structure between the ribs to support the 0.50 mm skin. The whole trailing edge is filled with control surfaces; inboard of the ailerons there are camber changing flaps divided into two parts, the inner <b>section</b> <b>deflecting</b> through greater angles than the outer. Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are fitted at inboard at mid-chord, opening {{above and below the}} wing. The wings also contain rubber bags to hold up to 110 lb of water ballast, with a dump valve in the fuselage behind the undercarriage monowheel.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the essential elements}} of the cryogenic system. The cryogenic distribution system starts {{at the level of}} the linac superconducting RF cavities [1] and moves out through the cryogenic piping to the liquid helium refrigeration plant that will be used to cool the RF cavities and the undulator magnets. For this report, the cryogenic distribution system and cryogenic refrigerator includes the following elements: (1) The piping within the linac cryogenic modules will influence the heat transfer through the super-fluid helium from the outer surface of the TESLA niobium cavity and the liquid to gas interface within the horizontal header pipe where the superfluid helium boils. This piping determines the final design of the linac cryogenic module. (2) The acceptable pressure drops determine the supply and return piping dimensions. (3) The helium distribution system is determined by the need to cool down and warm up the various elements in the light source. (4) The size of the cryogenic plant is determined by the heat loads and the probable margin of error on those heat loads. Since the final heat loads are determined by the acceleration gradient in the cavities, a linac with five cryogenic modules will be compared to a linac with only four cryogenic modules. The design assumes that all cryogenic elements in the facility will be cooled using a common cryogenic plant. To minimize vibration effects on the beam lines, this plant is assumed to be located some distance from the synchrotron light beam lines. All of the cryogenic elements in the facility will be attached to the helium refrigeration system through cryogenic transfer lines. The largest single cryogenic load is the main linac, which consists of four or five cryogenic modules depending on the design gradient for the cavities in the linac section. The second largest heat load comes from the cryogenic modules that contain the transverse deflecting RF cavities. The injector linac is the third largest heat load. The seven superconducting undulator magnets in the hard x-ray production section are the smallest heat loads connected to the light source refrigeration plant. The linac and <b>deflecting</b> cavity <b>sections</b> require helium cooling at 1. 9 K, 5 K and 40 K. The undulator magnets require two-phase helium cooling at 4. 3 to 4. 5 K...|$|R
