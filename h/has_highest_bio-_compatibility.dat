40|$|Hydrogels {{based on}} {{polyurethane}} (PU) are promising (bio-) materials {{because of their}} <b>bio-</b> <b>compatibility,</b> biodegradation and excellent mechanical properties. In this publication, polyurethane hydrogels were produced {{for the first time}} by a non-isocyanate route by solvent-free step-growth copolymerization between a CO 2 -sourced hydrophilic polyethy- lene glycol bi-cyclic carbonate with diamines {{in the presence of a}} cross-linker. Kinetic of poly(hydroxyurethane) (PHU) synthesis was monitored by ATR-IR and the chemical cross-linking was confirmed by rheology and gel contents measurements. Hydrogels were obtained by immersion of PHUs in water and the influence of the diamine/cross-linker ratio and the nature of diamine on the water swelling and compression properties (compression modulus, strain and stress at break) of PHU hydrogels was evaluated. Additionally, the compression properties of the hydrogels were improved by the addition of Montmorillonite as nanofiller in the PHU formulation. This work opens new application fields for CO 2 -sourced PHUs. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Global warming can {{substantially}} {{affect the}} export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peat-permafrost to aquatic systems. The direct degradability of such peat-derived DOC, however, is poorly constrained because previous permafrost thaw studies have mainly addressed mineral soil catchments or DOC pools {{that have already been}} processed in surface waters. We incubated peat cores from a palsa mire to compare an active layer and an experimentally thawed permafrost layer with regard to DOC composition and degradation potentials of pore water DOC. Our results show that DOC from the thawed permafrost layer <b>had</b> <b>high</b> initial degradation potentials compared with DOC from the active layer. In fact, the DOC that showed the <b>highest</b> <b>bio-</b> and photo-degradability, respectively, originated in the thawed permafrost layer. Our study sheds new light on the DOC composition of peat-permafrost directly upon thaw and suggests that past estimates of carbon-dioxide emissions from thawed peat permafrost may be biased as they have overlooked the initial mineralization potential of the exported DOC...|$|R
40|$|Presented to the 10 th Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) {{held at the}} Heskett Center, Wichita State University, April 25, 2014. Research {{completed}} at Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, College of Engineering, and Department of Mechanical Engineering, College of EngineeringDielectric elastomers (DEs) are soft actuation materials with promising applications in robotics and biomedical devices. In this paper, a bio-inspired artificial muscle actuator with artificial tendons is developed for robotic arm applications. The actuator uses a dielectric elastomer as artificial muscle and functionalized carbon fibers as artificial tendons. A VHB 4910 tape is used as the dielectric elastomer and PDMS is used as the bonding material to mechanically connect the carbon fibers to the elastomer. Carbon fibers are highly popular for their high electrical conductivities, mechanical strengths, and <b>bio-</b> <b>compatibilities.</b> After the acid treatments for the functionalization of carbon fibers (500 nm - 10 nm), one end of carbon fibers is spread into the PDMS material, which provides enough bonding strength with other dielectric elastomers, while the other end is connected to a DC power supply. Experimental {{results show that the}} conductivity of carbon fibers is capable of transfer input. The bonding strength of carbon fibers and PDMS material is also large enough to pull external load.

40|$|The auto- and {{heterotrophic}} microbenthic {{communities of}} a tidal flat in the Westerschelde estuary were studied at 4 stations {{in late spring}} and early autumn 1996. Additional information on the diatom component of these communities was obtained from a one-year survey of these organisms. Total autotrophic biomass greatly exceeded heterotrophic biomass in late spring, especially at the more silty stations. However, in autumn, the auto-/heterotrophic biomass ratio was much lower and is < 1 in the most sandy station. Epipelic diatoms generally comprised the bulk of primary producers, whereas epipsammic diatoms and flagellates only significantly contribute to autotrophic biomass in the more sandy sediments. Heterotrophic biomass was dominated by flagellates and ciliates. Sandy sediments had the most diverse ciliate communities and the <b>highest</b> <b>bio-</b> mass. The increase in ciliate biomass and the greater importance of her- bivorous versus bacterivorous ciliates from June to September might be attributed to selective grazing by metazoa on the generally larger herbivorous ciliates in June. Preliminary estimates indicate that apart from episodic blooms of herbivorous taxa, ciliate grazing {{does not seem to}} have an important impact on epipelic diatom populations. In general, silty sediments appear to be characterized by prominent temporal changes in microbenthic biomass and composition, related to predictable seasonal changes in environmental conditions as well as episodic and stochastic events resulting in severe disturbance and resuspension. Sandy sediments may have more complex and resilient microbenthic communities, adapted to a continuous regime of disturbance in the top layers of sediments and with a less pronounced seasonality...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{substantial}} progress {{made over the}} last decades {{in the treatment of}} cancer, there still is a great need for novel therapies. Especially for patients with advanced disease, chemotherapy is the best option. Nature is the primary source of anticancer drugs with compounds isolated from plants or micro-organisms. Moreover, the marine ecosystem provides for a growing number of promising agents in clinical trials. Besides natural resources, the increasing knowledge of tumour pathology and drug resistance mechanisms boosts the development of rationally designed anticancer agents, i. e. chemically synthesised derivatives of known anticancer agents exhibiting more favourable characteristics or development of novel biomolecularly engineered agents. It is rarely the case that a drug can be administered to humans as the pure chemical compound itself. Therefore, to enable evaluation of the novel anticancer drug in humans, a pharmaceutical formulation has to be developed. Anticancer agents at the early stage of development are generally administered as an intravenous bolus injection or infusion in order to obtain absolute bioavailibility, circumvent possible disturbance of or degradation in the gastrointestinal tract, {{and to be able to}} adjust or stop administration of the drug instantaneously in case of acute toxicity. Consequently, the development of a pharmaceutical formulation of a novel anticancer agent is focused on issues associated with the design of sterile and stable injectable products. This thesis describes the pharmaceutical development of three novel anticancer drugs, namely Imexon (chapter 1), C 1311 (chapter 2), and ES- 285. HCl (chapter 3). Imexon is a member of the class of 2 -cyanoaziridine derivatives and recent in vitro research demonstrated high cytotoxic activity for lymphoid malignancies, such as malignant lymphomas and multiple myeloma. C 1311 is the lead compound from the group of imidazoacridinones, a novel group of rationally designed anticancer drugs and exhibited significant cytotoxic activity in vitro towards several tumours and both in vitro and in vivo towards a range of colon tumours. ES- 285. HCl was originally derived from the marine clam Spisula polynyma. It has shown in vitro and in vivo cytotoxic activity against various tumour cell lines with selectivity for certain solid tumours (i. e. hepatocellular, prostate and renal). For each drug, the initial part of the chapter is dedicated to the development of a stability indicating assay for the novel anticancer drug. Moreover, the structural and analytical characterisation of the drug substance is described. Subsequently, the development of the pharmaceutical formulation and its stability upon storage is described. The chapters end with studies that were performed to evaluate the stability of the final formulated product in clinical practice, thus after reconstitution with an appropriate reconstitution solution and subsequent dilution in infusion solutions. Moreover, the (<b>bio-)</b> <b>compatibility</b> of the formulation solution with infusion systems and blood is described. The chapter dedicated to ES- 285. HCl is concluded with a study on the compatibility of platinum catalysed silicone tubing with the complexing excipient 2 -hydroxypropyl-Beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) used in the manufacture of ES- 285.

We also monitored pore widening (alumina dissolution) with subangstrom sensitivity, which is conceptually the reverse of detecting conformal film deposition on pore surfaces. Furthermore, we monitored the exchange of pore-filling media between phosphate buffer solution and ethanol, which produces qualitatively the same response as complete pore filling with other materials by various deposition techniques. Thus porous anodic alumina films may be employed simultaneously as deposition templates and as highly sensitive detectors of processes within the pores...|$|R
50|$|The {{basis for}} most LOC {{fabrication}} processes is photolithography. Initially most processes were in silicon, as these well-developed technologies were directly derived from semiconductor fabrication. Because of demands for e.g. specific optical characteristics, <b>bio-</b> or chemical <b>compatibility,</b> lower production costs and faster prototyping, new processes {{have been developed}} such as glass, ceramics and metal etching, deposition and bonding, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) processing (e.g., soft lithography), OSTE polymers (OSTEmer) processing, thick-film- and stereolithography as well as fast replication methods via electroplating, injection molding and embossing. The demand for cheap and easy LOC prototyping resulted in a simple methodology for the fabrication of PDMS microfluidic devices: ESCARGOT (Embedded SCAffold RemovinG Open Technology). This technique allows {{for the creation of}} microfluidic channels, in a single block of PDMS, via a dissolvable scaffold (made by e.g. 3D printing).Furthermore, the LOC field more and more exceeds the borders between lithography-based microsystem technology, nanotechnology and precision engineering.|$|R

40|$|Dissolved {{organic carbon}} (DOC) {{is the major}} form of organic carbon in aquatic ecosystems. Biological and {{photochemical}} degradation of DOC are major causes of greenhouse gas emissions from aquatic ecosystems. In response to current changes in climate, studies at different northern-hemisphere locations have shown both increases and decreases in total DOC export from land to water. However, there is lack of knowledge {{on the effect of}} changing environmental conditions on bio- and photo-degradation potentials. Therefore, this thesis aimed to combine empirical and experimental methods to determine the dynamics of DOC reactivity in response to key environmental parameters related to soil frost conditions and hydrology. I collected samples from the boreal region to carry out laboratory degradation experiments and to analyze the DOC degradation potentials in relation to environmental variables and intrinsic properties of the DOC. In a boreal forest region that has seasonal soil frost, the DOC bio-reactivity decreased with experimental reductions in the extent and duration of soil frost, while photo-reactivity remained constant. However, DOC from experimentally thawed permafrost peat in the subarctic north showed <b>higher</b> <b>bio-</b> and photo-degradation potentials than the DOC from active peat layers above the permafrost. The nature of the soil and intrinsic DOC properties explained these patterns in soil DOC reactivity. In the surface water network, bio-degradation was the dominant DOC degradation mechanism in brow-water lakes, while photo-degradation played a relatively larger role in clearer waters. The surface water photo-reactivity per unit of light absorption was high at both acidic and at alkaline conditions, while lower at intermediate pH, probably due to effects of the protonation state of DOC on photo-reactivity. Therefore, pH change along the aquatic network caused extrinsic control on the photo-reactivity at the landscape scale. In conclusion the results show that climate warming decreases the export of bio-reactive DOC in a boreal forest, but it likely increases the export of bio- and photo-reactive DOC in a permafrost peatland. In a wetter climate with shorter residence times, clear waters may experience browning and relative shift from photo-degradation to bio-degradation, while already brown lakes will remain brown and dominated by bio-degradation. Furthermore, the loss of photo reactive DOC during transport in aquatic network may be counter balanced by the changes in extrinsic variables such as pH...|$|R
