25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Confederate States in 1865, Jackman and some of his men decided not to surrender and headed for Mexico. Along the way Jackman reunited with his now-released family in Shreveport, Louisiana, and proceeded with them toward Texas and the border. Near the end of 1865 they arrived in the city of San Marcos, located in Hays County, Texas. Jackman entered northern Mexico, leaving his family in Texas while <b>he</b> <b>ascertained</b> whether to relocate there. Deciding against it, he crossed back into the United States and surrendered to Federal authorities in San Antonio. Taken to New Orleans, Louisiana, took the loyalty oath to the U.S. Government, and was subsequently paroled.|$|E
25|$|Wren {{had been}} {{involved}} in repairs of the old cathedral since 1661. In the spring of 1666, he made his first design for a dome for St Paul's. It was accepted in principle on 27 August 1666. One week later, however, the Great Fire of London reduced two-thirds of the City to a smoking desert and old St Paul's to a ruin. Wren was most likely at Oxford at the time, but the news, so fantastically relevant to his future, drew him at once to London. Between 5 and 11 September <b>he</b> <b>ascertained</b> the precise area of devastation, worked out a plan for rebuilding the City and submitted it to Charles II. Others also submitted plans. However, no new plan proceeded any further than the paper on which it was drawn. A rebuilding act which provided rebuilding of some essential buildings was passed in 1667. In 1669, the King's Surveyor of Works died and Wren was promptly installed.|$|E
25|$|Cassius Dio {{wrote that}} Caesar {{secretly}} set Publius Clodius Pulcher against Cicero {{because of his}} suspicions about the Vettius affair. He considered Cicero a dangerous enemy. He did so when <b>he</b> <b>ascertained</b> that Clodius would to do him a favour in return for not testifying against {{him when he was}} tried for sacrilege three years earlier (see above). However, Clodius did not need to owe anything to Caesar to attack Cicero. He bore a grudge against Cicero because he had testified against him at this trial. In another passage Cassius Dio wrote that after the trial Clodius hated the optimates. Suetonius described Clodius as the enemy of Cicero. Appian wrote that Clodius had already requited Caesar by helping him to secure the governorship of Gaul before Caesar unleashed him against Cicero and that Caesar ‘turned a private grievance to useful account’. Moreover, Clodius was already an ally of Pompey before this. As mentioned in the previous section, Plutarch wrote that Pompey had already allied with Clodius when his attempt to have the acts for his settlements in the east failed before the creation of the triumvirate.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{reaching}} the Cayos Arcas, where {{the rest of}} his flotilla had remained, Moore found that the San Jacinto had run aground on a sand bar {{and the rest of the}} ships were not to be seen. Austin set out to find the rest of the ships, Zavala and San Bernard, touching at the port of Campeche on 8 November and Sisal on 10 November. The flagship finally caught up with the rest of the ships at Frontera on 14 November. In order to salvage the San Jacinto and provide fuel for the lone steamship, Zavala, Moore hatched a plan to gain money. The Zavala towed the other two ships 60 miles up the San Juan Bautista River to the capital of the Mexican state of Tabasco, Villahermosa. There the small flotilla pointed their guns at the city and then sent troops into the seemingly deserted capital. Commodore Moore encountered a man bearing a white flag on a tree branch, and when <b>he</b> <b>ascertained</b> that this was the Mayor, the Texas commodore demanded $25,000 or he would level the town. The Mayor asked if silver would be acceptable, and upon receiving an affirmative reply, delivered the ransom. The commodore set sail with the silver and used the money to repair and outfit his ships.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} mostly positive reviews commending Burke's vocals and {{the mainstream}} R/pop feel {{and production of}} the song. Matthew Chisling of Allmusic called the track [...] "the most brilliant, perfect mainstream pop single of 2009", commending the song's synthesized beat and larger-than-life chorus, and Flo Rida's rap, stating that it made Burke [...] "the prime UK import for the North American market". Popjustice called the song [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "phenomenal", commending the song's [...] "Womanizer"-like intro and the chorus’s strong melodic topline. The review praised Burke's vocals, calling them [...] "Whitneyish in parts" [...] and compared them to Donna Summer. Although the review noted the song was not built for Burke's extreme vocals, it said, [...] "that there's something quite exciting about an incredible singer being forced to follow a very strong and melodic topline instead of going all over the show." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com also said the song was reminiscent of Donna Summer, and said, [...] "Big international success seems a real possibility as Burke steps into the battle for R diva crown." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy said the song complimented Burke's [...] "sass and all-around performance skill" [...] rather than a ballad would, and called the song [...] "fun", pulling off a [...] "minor pop miracle- turning a cameo by Flo Rida into a good thing". Alexis Petrids of The Guardian noted although some may see the single as [...] "generic", and [...] "currently pop's factory-default setting", <b>he</b> <b>ascertained</b> the song was [...] "a superior example of the type, furnished with an effortlessly unshakeable chorus". Although Harry Guerin of RTÉ noted the production and formula of the music was a flaw of the album, he noted that that technique worked in [...] "Bad Boys". Simon Price of The Independent was more critical of the song, calling it a [...] "pale imitation" [...] of Britney Spears' [...] "Womanizer".|$|E
2500|$|The scandal erupted on October 31, 2005, when Winternals (later {{acquired}} by Microsoft) researcher Mark Russinovich posted to his blog {{a detailed description}} and technical analysis of F4I's XCP software that <b>he</b> <b>ascertained</b> had been recently installed on his computer by a Sony BMG music CD. Russinovich compared the software to a rootkit due to its surreptitious installation and its efforts to hide its existence. He noted that the EULA does not mention the software, and he asserted emphatically that the software is illegitimate and that digital rights management had [...] "gone too far".|$|E

2500|$|Under Warren Hastings (British Governorships 1772-1785) the {{consolidation}} of British imperial rule over Bengal was solidified, with the [...] conversion of a trade area into an [...] occupied territory under a military-civil government., while {{the formation of a}} regularised system of legislation was brought in under John Shore. Acting through Lord Cornwallis, then Governor-General, <b>he</b> <b>ascertained</b> and defined the rights of the landholders over the soil. These landholders under the previous system had started, for the most part, as collectors of the revenues, and gradually acquired certain prescriptive rights as quasi-proprietors of the estates entrusted to them by the government. In 1793 Lord Cornwallis declared their rights perpetual, and gave over the land of Bengal to the previous quasi-proprietors or zamindars, on condition of the payment of a fixed land tax. This piece of legislation is known as the Permanent Settlement of the Land Revenue. It was designed to [...] "introduce" [...] ideas of property rights to India, and stimulate a market in land. The former aim misunderstood the nature of landholding in India, and the latter was an abject failure.|$|E
