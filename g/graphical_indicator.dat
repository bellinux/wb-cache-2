Stream shading and cool water temperature regimes {{are important to}} protect stream-dwelling organisms. We are examining riparian temperature regimes within the coastal redwood area of Mendocino County. Summer temperature gradients are being characterized along fifteen transects set perpendicular to watercourses within four different watersheds. Data loggers record temperature along each transect at pre-determined spatial intervals from the watercourse midpoint. With {{the exception of a}} control transect, all watercourses in this study are subject to near-future timber operations. This study {{is part of a larger}} program to detect changes in riparian microclimate as a result of timber harvest. Here we examine the relationship between temperature and physiography, and explore different methods of analysis in order to characterize pre-harvest temperature gradients. As with similar studies, we find upslope temperatures increase with distance from the watercourse. The greatest temperature increase per unit distance occurred between the watercourse mid-point station and the 25 ft stations on either side.

40|$|Project {{managers}} {{are responsible for}} numerous decisions affecting systems under their purview. To make these decisions and effectively manage projects, they need methods for quantifying technical progress and quality and identifying issues early in the project life cycle. Typically, information is obtained through reviews, which provide information on risks, problems, and work completed to date. However, these reviews are generally aimed at identifying problems within isolated components or artifacts. They often fail to expose problems related to the end-to-end system or the underlying, systemic issues that led to them. The technical assessment method introduced in this paper addresses these shortfalls by providing a framework for evaluating a system from several perspectives, or views, for a comprehensive picture of progress and quality. It also describes a structured approach that customers and developers can use to measure progress at each review. A <b>graphical</b> <b>indicator</b> is introduced that clearly depicts technical progress and quality, enabling those involved with the project {{to make informed decisions}} to mitigate problems and reduce quality risks.

40|$|Many {{studies to}} date have {{supported}} empirically {{the reality of the}} so-called proximity compatibility principle. This principle states that emergent features tend to have beneficial effects on integrated and detrimental effects on focused task performance. In order to clarify the role of salience of various graphical features in relationship to this principle, an experiment was conducted in which the effect of emergent features and the salience of both <b>graphical</b> <b>indicators</b> and emergent features (if present) was studied on integrated and focused task performance using a graph reading task. It was found that, though the principle was confirmed in this study if its relationship with salience is ignored, taking salience of both lower-order and higher-order graphical features into consideration can significantly complicate the basic form of the principle. Illustrations are provided of how two types of salience can interact both {{with each other and with}} the type of task in rather unexpected ways.

40|$|AbstractSystems architecting tools {{assist in}} {{describing}} and analyzing complex systems {{and promote the}} design of better systems through structured analysis. As a system in and of itself, an architecting tool can be subject to betterments, adjustments, and improvements, which add to its usefulness for the architecting community. The implementation of architecting principles within a tool can increase the efficiency of that tool and its user. The research described in this paper provides a functional model comparison of some standard functional notations, and specifies an architect's need for additional <b>graphical</b> <b>indicators</b> on executable diagrams. These indicators are intended to deliver improved visualization of disconnects among various levels of functional decomposition on executable diagrams to improve {{the efficiency of the}} design process. This paper proposes small enhancements to current executable modeling notations to graphically identify decompositional disconnects on EFFBD and action diagrams. The suggested implementation detects and illustrates inconsistencies in decompositional relationships, which generate errors if these relationships are overlooked by the user during diagram construction. Several examples are shown to portray the lack of <b>graphical</b> <b>indicators</b> on executable diagrams, forcing the user to manually identify illogical relationships, and rerun the simulation until it succeeds in running to completion; this is a process that can be very time consuming as a result of user error. Proposed notational enhancements increase efficiency by lessening repetitive efforts and time troubleshooting these user errors causing discrepancies found in simulation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the promise of}} augmenting interactive multivariate representations with information from statistical processes {{in the domain of}} weather data analysis. Statistical regression, correlation analysis, and descriptive statistical calculations are integrated via <b>graphical</b> <b>indicators</b> into an enhanced parallel coordinates system, called the Multidimensional Data eXplorer (MDX). These statistical indicators, which highlight significant associations in the data, are complemented with interactive visual analysis capabilities. The resulting system allows a smooth, interactive, and highly visual workflow. The system’s utility is demonstrated with an extensive hurricane climate study that was conducted by a hurricane expert. In the study, the expert used a new data set of environmental weather data, composed of 28 independent variables, to predict annual hurricane activity. MDX shows the Atlantic Meridional Mode increases the explained variance of hurricane seasonal activity by 7 - 15 % and removes less significant variables used in earlier studies. The findings and feedback from the expert (1) validate the utility of the data set for hurricane prediction, and (2) indicate that the integration of statistical processes with interactive parallel coordinates, as implemented in MDX, addresses both deficiencies in traditional weather data analysis and exhibits some of the expected benefits of visual data analysis...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the efficiency of a low-speed reciprocal shaker for the mechanical {{dispersion of}} soil samples of different textural classes. The particle size of 61 soil samples was analyzed in four replications, using the pipette method to determine the clay fraction and sieving to determine coarse, fine and total sand fractions. The silt content was obtained by difference. To evaluate the performance, the results of the reciprocal shaker (RSh) were compared with data of the same soil samples available in reports of the Proficiency testing for Soil Analysis Laboratories of the Agronomic Institute of Campinas (Prolab/IAC). The accuracy was analyzed based on the maximum and minimum values defining the confidence intervals for the particle-size fractions of each soil sample. <b>Graphical</b> <b>indicators</b> were also used for data comparison, based on dispersion and linear adjustment. The descriptive statistics indicated predominantly low variability in more than 90 % of the results for sand, medium-textured and clay samples, and for 68 % of the results for heavy clay samples, indicating satisfactory repeatability of measurements with the RSh. Medium variability was frequently associated with silt, followed by the fine sand fraction. The sensitivity analyses indicated an accuracy of 100 % for the three main separates (total sand, silt and clay), in all 52 samples of the textural classes heavy clay, clay and medium. For the nine sand soil samples, the average accuracy was 85. 2 %; highest deviations were observed for the silt fraction. In relation to the linear adjustments, the correlation coefficients of 0. 93 (silt) or > 0. 93 (total sand and clay), as well as the differences between the angular coefficients and the unit < 0. 16, indicated a high correlation between the reference data (Prolab/IAC) and results obtained with the RSh. In conclusion, the mechanical dispersion by the reciprocal shaker of soil samples of different textural classes was satisfactory.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an introduction, in which is highlighted {{the importance of}} the time series analysis in the statistics studies, due to the multitude of information that can be detached from their calculation, the mode in which are used the statistical and econometrical analysis methods of the time series components in the foreign and Romanian specialized literature, as the statistical methodology used for the characterization of the tourism activity in Romania, in the period 1997 - 2011, consisting of: average ranks method used for the bi-criteria hierarchy of the territorial series, the time series analysis methods namely: <b>graphical</b> method, average <b>indicators</b> analysis of series comprised of total tourist arrivals, foreign and Romanian tourist arrivals, statistical methods of time series adjustment, grouped in two categories: mechanical methods (moving averages method, average spore method and average index method) and analytical methods (linear function and 2 nd degree parabola) and statistical forecasting based on the above mentioned methods. Indicators taken in study were the tourist arrivals and overnight stays on total country, on foreign and Romanian tourists and, on their basis, it could be calculated and analyzed also the average length of stay. Considered horizon of prognosis was a medium one that is until the year 2015. Data source is represented by Anuarul statistic al României, published by the National Institute of Statistics...|$|R
40|$|Technologies are {{changing}} the world around us, and education is not immune from its influence: the field {{of teaching and learning}} supported by the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), also known as Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL), has witnessed a huge expansion in recent years. This wide adoption happened thanks to the massive diffusion of broadband connections and to the pervasive needs for education, highly connected to the evolution in sciences and technologies. Therefore, it has pushed up the usage of online education (distance and blended methodologies for educational experiences) to, even in lately years, unexpected rates. Alongside with the well known potentialities, digital-based educational tools come with a number of downsides, such as possible disengagement {{on the part of the}} learner, absence of the social pressures that normally exist in a classroom environment, difficulty or even inability from the learners to self-regulate and, last but not least, depletion of the stimulus to actively participate and cooperate with lectures and peers. These difficulties impact the teaching process and the outcomes of the educational experience (i. e. learning process), being a serious limit and questioning the broader applicability of TEL solutions. To overcome these issues, there is a need of tools to support the learning process. In the literature, one of the known approach to improve the situation is to rely on a user profile, that collects data during the use of the eLearning platforms or tool. The created profile can be used to adapt the behaviour and the contents proposed to the learner. On top of this model, some researches stressed the positive effects stimulated by the disclosure of the model itself for inspection purposes by the learner. This disclosed model is known as Open Learner Model (OLM). The idea of opening learners' profile and eventually integrate them with external on-line resources is not new and it has the ultimate goal of creating global and long-run indicators of the learner's profile. Also the representation aspect of the learner model plays a role, moving from the more traditional approach based on the textual and analytic/extensive representation to the <b>graphical</b> <b>indicators</b> that are able to summarise and to present one or more of the model characteristics in a way that is considered more effective and natural for the user consumption. Relying on the same learner models, and stressing the different aggregation and representation capabilities, it is possible to either support self-reflection of the learner or to foster the tutoring process to allow proper supervision by the tutor/teacher. Both the objectives can be reached through the graphical representation of the relevant information, presented in different ways. Furthermore, with such an open approach for the learner model, the concepts of personalisation and adaptation acquire a central role in the TEL experience, overcoming the previous limits related to the impossibility to observe and explain to the learner the reasons for such an intervention from the tool itself. As a consequence, the introduction of different tools, platforms, widgets and devices in the learning process, together with the adaptation process based on the learner profiles, can create a personal space for a potential fruitful usage of the rich and widespread amount of resources available to the learner. This work aimed at analysing the way a learner model could be represented in visual presentation to the system users, exploring the effects and performances for learners and teachers. Subsequently, it concentrated in investigating how the adoption of adaptive and social visualisations of OLM could affect the student experience within a TEL context. The motivation was twofold. On one side was to show that the approach of mixing data from heterogeneous and not already related data sources could have a meaningful didactic interpretations, whether on the other one was to measure the perceived impact of the introduction on online experiences of the adaptivity (and of social aspects) in the graphical visualisations produced by such a tool. In order to achieve these objectives, the present work analysed and addressed them through an approach that merged user data in learning platforms, implementing a learner profile. This was accomplished by means of the creation of a tool, named GVIS, to elaborate on the collected user actions in platforms enabling remote teaching. A number of test cases were performed and analysed, adopting the developed tool as the provider to extract, to aggregate and to represent the data for the learners' model. The GVIS tool impact was then estimated with self- evaluation questionnaires, with the analysis of log files and with knowledge quiz results. Dimensions such as the perceived usefulness, the impact on motivation and commitment, the cognitive overload generated, and the impact of social data disclosure were taken into account. The main result found by the application of the developed tool in TEL experiences was to have an impact on the behaviour of online learners when used to provide them with indicators around their activities, especially when enhanced with social capabilities. The effects appear to be amplifies in those cases where the widget usage is as simplified as possible. From the learner side, the results suggested that the learners seem to appreciate the tool and recognise its value. For them the introduction as part of the online learning experience could act as a positive pressure factor, enhanced by the peer comparison functionality. This functionality could also be used to reinforce the student engagement and positive commitment to the educational experience, by transmitting a sense of community and stimulating healthy competition between learners. From the teacher/tutor side, they seemed to be better supported by the presentation of compact, intuitive and just-in-time information (i. e. actions that have an educational interpretation or impact) about the monitored user or group. This gave them a clearer picture of how the class is currently performing and enabled them to address performance issues by adapting the resources and the teaching (and learning) approach accordingly. Although a drawback was identified regarding the cognitive overload, the data collected showed that users generally considered this kind of support useful. There is also indications that further analyses can be interesting to explore the effects introduced in the teaching practices by the availability and usage of such a tool...|$|R
