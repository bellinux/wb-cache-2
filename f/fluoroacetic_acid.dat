50|$|<b>Fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> is a {{chemical}} compound with formula CH2FCOOH. The sodium salt, sodium fluoroacetate, {{is used as}} a pesticide. It inhibits the aconitase step of the citric acid cycle.|$|E
5000|$|... 2-Fluoroethanol is the {{chemical}} compound with the formula CH2FCH2OH and the simplest fluorohydrin. This colorless liquid {{is one of}} the simplest stable fluorinated alcohols. It was developed for use as a rodenticide, insecticide, and acaricide. Owing to its easy oxidation to <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> fluoroethanol is highly toxic ( [...] = 10 mg/kg). The related difluoro- and trifluoroethanols are far less dangerous.|$|E
50|$|Fluorocitric acid is a {{fluorinated}} {{carboxylic acid}} derived from citric acid by substitution of one hydrogen by a fluorine atom. The appropriate anion is called fluorocitrate. It is a metabolite of <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{and is very}} toxic {{because it is not}} processable using aconitase in the citrate cycle (where fluorocitrate takes place of citrate as the substrate). The enzyme is inhibited and the cycle stops working.|$|E
50|$|AM-1235 {{metabolism}} differs {{only slightly}} {{from that of}} JWH-018. AM-1235 N-dealkylation produces fluoropentane instead of pentane (or plain alkanes in general). It has been speculated that the fluoropentane might function as an alkylating agent or is further metabolized into toxic <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid.</b> This is not true since fluoroalkanes do not act as alkylating agents under normal conditions and uneven fluoroalkane chains metabolize into substantially less toxic fluoropropanoic acid.|$|E
5000|$|Fluoroacetate occurs {{naturally}} {{in at least}} 40 plants in Australia, Brazil, and Africa. It was first identified in Dichapetalum cymosum, commonly known as gifblaar (Afrikaans) or poison leaf, by Marais in 1944. As early as 1904, colonists in Sierra Leone used extracts of Chailletia toxicaria, which also contains <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> or its salts, to poison rats. Several native Australian plant genera contain the toxin, including: Gastrolobium, Gompholobium, Oxylobium, Nemcia, and Acacia.|$|E
50|$|Sodium fluoroacetate, {{known in}} {{pesticide}} form as 1080, is the organofluorine chemical compound with the formula FCH2CO2Na. This colourless salt has a taste {{similar to that}} of sodium chloride and is used as a metabolic poison. Potassium fluoroacetate occurs naturally as an anti-herbivore metabolite in various plants but can also be produced synthetically. It is a derivative of <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> a carboxylic acid. The more common fluorinated acetic acid (trifluoroacetic acid) and its derivatives are far less toxic.|$|E

50|$|In 1954 Abraham Cantarow and Karl Paschkis found liver tumors absorbed {{radioactive}} uracil {{more readily}} than normal liver cells. Charles Heidelberger, who had earlier found that fluorine in <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibited a vital enzyme, asked Robert Duschinsky and Robert Schnitzer at Hoffman-La Roche to synthesize fluorouracil. Some credit Heidelberger and Duschinsky with the discovery that 5-fluorouracil markedly inhibited tumors in mice. The original 1957 report in Nature has Heidelberger as lead author, along with N. K. Chaudhuri, Peter Danneberg, Dorothy Mooren, Louis Griesbach, Robert Duschinsky, R. J. Schnitzer, E. Pleven, and J. Scheiner.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is known}} to lead to {{inhibition}} of aconitase and block both the Krebs and glyoxylate cycles. In this study, we discovered {{it to be a}} potent and specific inhibitor of reproduction in a bioassay using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. <b>Fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> added to the growth medium reduced reproduction in the second generation by 50 % at concentrations 3, 000 times lower than the concentrations that reduced 24 -hour survival by 50 %. Four concentrations (2, 4, 8, and 17 mM) of <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> were tested thoroughly. At the two lower concentrations, the survival rates were unaffected, and first-generation reproduction was greatly reduced but not completely eliminated. Survival was reduced at the higher concentrations. Malonate, which inhibits the Krebs cycle, and itaconate, which inhibits the glyoxylate cycle, were tested individually and in combination. The combination did not specifically inhibit reproduction, suggesting another mode of action for <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> shows promise as a tool in studies requiring age synchrony...|$|E

40|$|Biochemical data on {{the fate}} of monofluoroacetic acid in animals are of con-siderable interest, {{not only because of the}} high degree of {{toxicity}} of the com-pound, but also because of the possible bearing of such data on heretofore eva-sive problems of intermediary metabolism. In a recent publication Chenoweth (1) has reviewed the literature concerning this subject. Previously, Ramsey and Clifford (2) discussed their chemical method for the determination of mono-fluoroacetic acid in foods and biological tissues. This method, which was em-ployed in this work, is based upon the total fluorine content of an isolated organic acid fraction, partition chromatography being employed to effect complete sep-aration of fluoroacetate from inorganic fluorine. It is assumed that all of the fluorine in the organic acid fraction represents <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid.</b> However, whether or not this fraction includes possible fluorine containing acid metabolic products is unknown.

40|$|An {{uncoupler}} of oxidative phosphorylation, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, and an aconitase inhibitor, <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> both {{of which}} are known to lower the cellular ATP pool, protected Escherichia coli cells from the bactericidal actions of gyrase poisons including quinolone antibiotics, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, and the epipodophyllotoxins VP- 16 and VM- 26. Using purified E. coli DNA gyrase, we examined the effect of ATP on gyrase-mediated DNA cleavage in the presence of these gyrase poisons. ATP was shown to stimulate gyrase-mediated DNA cleavage from 10 - to more than 100 -fold in the presence of these gyrase poisons. ADP antagonized the stimulatory effect of ATP. Consequently, gyrase-mediated DNA cleavage induced by gyrase poisons is modulated by the ATP concentration/ADP concentration ([ATP]/[ADP]) ratio. Coumermycin A 1, an inhibitor of the ATPase subunit of DNA gyrase, like ADP, also effectively antagonized the stimulatory effect of ATP on gyrase-mediated DNA cleavage induced by gyrase poisons. Furthermore, coumermycin A 1, like DNP and <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> also protected cells from the bactericidal action of gyrase poisons. In the aggregate, our results are consistent with the notion that the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio, through its modulatory effect on the gyrase-mediated DNA cleavage, is an important determinant of cellular susceptibility to gyrase poisons...|$|E
40|$|A new {{and in part}} {{automated}} headspace solid-phase microextraction {{method for}} quantitative determination of the highly toxic rodenticide <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (FAA) in serum and other biological samples has been developed. FAA and deuterated acetic acid (internal standard) were extracted from acidified samples by a StableFlex divinylbenzene-Carboxen on polydimethylsiloxane fibre. The acids were derivatised on the fibre in-situ with 1 -pyrenyldiazomethane and detected using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with electron impact ionisation and selected ion monitoring. The calibration curve for FAA in serum was linear over the range from 0. 02 to 5 microg/ml, with limits of detection and quantification of 0. 02 and 0. 07 microg/ml, respectively.

40|$|I {{read with}} {{interest}} the recent article by Yeh and Cheng (1997) concerning toxicity of the 5 -fluorouracil/leucovorin (HDFL) treatment protocol. The clinical presentation of side-effects was encephalopathy associated with laboratory findings of hyperammonaemia, lactic acidosis and hypotriglyceridaemia. This phenomenon was present in 5. 7 % of patients treated with the HDFL protocol. The authors conclude that ammonia as the endproduct of 5 FU metabolism overloads capacity of the Krebs cycle and that under HDFL treatment {{a large amount of}} <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> directly inhibits the ATP-producing Krebs cycle (Yeh and Cheng, 1997).

40|$|The {{possibility}} of a double Walden inversion mechanism of the fluoracetate dehalogenase FAcD (RPA 1163) has been studied by subjecting rac- 2 -fluoro- 2 -phenyl acetic acid to the defluorination process. This stereochemical probe led to inversion of configuration in a kinetic resolution with an extremely high selectivity factor (E > 500), showing that the classical mechanism involving SN 2 reaction by Asp 110 pertains. The high preference for the (S) -substrate is of synthetic value. Wide substrate scope of RPA 1163 in such hydrolytic kinetic resolutions can be expected because {{the reaction of the}} even more sterically demanding rac- 2 -fluoro- 2 -benzyl acetic acid proceeded similarly. Substrate acceptance and stereoselectivity were explained by extensive molecular modeling (MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) computations.

40|$|Current {{responses}} to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) in layer V pyramidal neurons {{of the rat}} prefrontal cortex were potentiated by the P 2 receptor agonists adenosine 59 -triphosphate (ATP) and uridine 59 -triphosphate (UTP). The failure of these nucleotides to induce inward current on fast local superfusion suggested the activation of P 2 Y rather than P 2 X receptors. The potentiation by ATP persisted in a Ca 21 -free superfusion medium but was abolished by 1, 2 -bis(2 -amino- 5 -fluorophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N 9,N 9 tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl) ester, cyclopiazonic acid, 7 -nitroindazole, <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> bafilomycin, and tetanus toxin, indicating that an astrocytic signaling molecule may participate.

40|$|Glucose-adapted {{cells of}} a sporogenic mutant. MSp+, and an asporogenic mutant, RSpoIIIa, of Clostridium botulinum type E rapidly {{fermented}} glucose, fructose, maltose, and sucrose, resulting in cytoplasmic granulation, heavy growth, a pH of 80 % refractile endospores in 25 h, whereas the RSpoIIIa mutant which was blocked at early forespore stage had commenced to lyse. Both mutants accumulated acetate and intracellular granules, reaching maximal levels at early stationary phase of growth. In MSp+, as {{the levels of}} acetokinase, phosphotransacetylase, and butyryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase reached a maximum, butyrate accumulation continued concurrently with an increase of endospore formation, whereas the levels of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate decreased simultaneously with its precursor, acetate. Butyrate biosynthesis was blocked in the asporogenic mutant. As shown by isotopic assays, butyrate and acetate serve as precursors of spore lipids. β-Phenethyl alcohol, <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> and 2 -picolinic acid inhibited anaerobic sporogenesis almost completely, butyrate biosynthesis by > 87 %, and acetate accumulation by 50 to 62 %, showing a direct relationship between butyric type of fermentation and anaerobic sporulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{rate of the}} aerobic {{metabolism}} of {{pyruvic acid}} by bakers' yeast cells is determined mainly {{by the amount of}} undissociated acid present. As a consequence, the greatest rate of oxidation was observed at pH 2. 8. Oxidation, at a slow rate, started at pH 1. 08; at pH 9. 4 there was no oxidation at all. The anaerobic metabolism, {{only a fraction of the}} aerobic, was observed only in acid solutions. There was none at pH values higher than 3. Pyruvic acid in the presence of oxygen was oxidized directly to acetic acid; in the absence of oxygen it was metabolized mainly by dismutation to lactic and acetic acids, and CO 2. Acetic acid formation was demonstrated on oxidation of pyruvic acid at pH 1. 91, and on addition of <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid.</b> Succinic acid formation was shown by addition of malonic acid. These metabolic pathways in a cell so rich in carboxylase may be explained by the arrangement of enzymes within the cell, so that carboxylase is at the center, while pyruvic acid oxidase is located at the periphery. Succinic and citric acids were oxidized only in acid solutions up to pH 4. Malic and α-ketoglutaric acids were not oxidized, undoubtedly because of lack of penetration...|$|E
40|$|The point-chart {{approximation}} of the Miertus-Scrocco-Tomasi solvation model (MST-PC) {{based on a}} continuum representation of the solvent has been incorporated in force field calculations. Application in molecular mechanics (MM) involves conformational equilibria in solution: rotational isomers of ethylene glycol (I), 1, 2 -difluoreothane (II), <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (III), and representative conformers of macrocyclic receptors such as 18 -crown- 6 (IV), cryptand 2. 2. 2 (V), and t-butyl-calix[4]arenetetraamide (VI). Assessment of the MST-PC results {{is based on the}} comparison with ab initio reactive field calculations (for I-III), with the continuum model of Still (W. C. Still et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1990, 112, 6127) (for I-VI), and with average solute-solvent interaction energies obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with explicit solvent in water (I-VI) and in acetonitrile (IV-VI). It is demonstrated that the continuum solvent model qualitatively reproduces the trends in solvation energies in water. The few exceptions may be related to particular topological features of the solute. An improved discrete/continuum approach in which some first-shell solvent molecules are considered {{as a part of the}} solute embedded in the dielectric continuum provides more realistic results, as is shown for VI in water. The MST-PC model which mimics the solute-solvent electrostatic interaction only fails to reproduce conformationally dependent solvation energies in acetonitrile, in which the electrostatic contribution is relatively small compared to van der Waals interactions. Exploratory MD simulations within the continuum model in water are reported on urea and 18 -crown- 6...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{mechanism}} of the neurotoxicity of 5 -FU and/or its masked compounds, we studied the effects of α-fluoro-β-alanine (FBAL) and <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (FA) on the formation of vacuolar changes in the dog cerebrum, using the dosage of 3. 0 mg/kg/day of FBAL・HCl (FBAL・HCl) and 0. 03 mg/kg/day of FA・Na (FA・Na), respectively. These 2 compounds were selected {{because they are the}} metabolites of 5 -FU claimed to be responsible for the neurotoxic effects of 5 -FU and/or its masked compounds, and we wanted to confirm their effects. Tegafur-uracil mixture (UFT) was used as a positive control drug for the formation of vacuolar changes in the dog cerebrum. All compounds were orally administered daily for 3 months to beagle dogs. Each study group consisted of 3 males. Neurotoxic signs such as hyperesthesia and/or excitement, as well as convulsions, were observed in both FBAL・HCl and FA・Na groups; these toxic signs were also found in the UFT group. Slight loss of body weight gain and of food consumption was observed in the FBAL・HCl and UFT groups. Neuropathologically, vacuolar changes were detected in several areas of the dog cerebrum following administration of FBAL・HCl, FA・Na or UFT. In terms of morphology, the neuropathological effects of these 2 drugs were very similar to those induced by UFT. In conclusion, we clearly showed that FBAL {{is one of the main}} substances that cause neurotoxic signs and neuropathological changes in dogs intoxicated by 5 -FU or its masked compounds. Moreover, FA might be considered to be a causative factor in addition to FBAL...|$|E

The fastest rates of photo{{reduction of}} Fe(lll) to Fe(ll) were achieved with ferrihydrite as an electron acceptor and <b>fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> as an electron donor. The relative rates of photooxidation of the monohalogenated acetic acids with ferrihydrite in order of decreasing reactivity were as follows: FCH_ 2 CO_ 2 H > CICH_ 2 CO_ 2 H > BrCH_ 2 CO_ 2 H > ICH_ 2 CO_ 2 H; for multiple substituents the relative order of reactivity was as follows: FCH_ 2 CO_ 2 H > F_ 2 CHCO_ 2 H > F_ 3 CCO_ 2 H. With respect to the iron oxide electron acceptors, the relative order of reactivity toward monohaloacetate oxidation was am-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 - 3 H_ 2 O > γ-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 > γ-FeOOH ≥ α-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 ≥ Fe_(aerosol) > α-FeOOH. Strong kinetic isotope effects observed for the photooxidation of CICD_ 2 CO_ 2 H suggest that the oxidation of the mono- and disubstituted haloacetic acids proceeds via hydrogen-atom abstraction by surface-bound hydroxyl radicals to produce haloacetate radicals, which in turn yield the corresponding halide and glycolic acid.

40|$|Dichapetalum cymosum (poison leaf) is a {{very common}} problem plant in {{southern}} Africa. <b>Fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{believed to be the}} poisonous entity in the plant, is produced by the plant, but the micro-organisms associated with this plant may also {{play a role in the}} production thereof. A previous study on Burolderia cepacia, an endophyte of D. cymosum showed active metabolism of fluoroacetate by this endophyte. The isolated endophytes from D. cymosum were studied to determine whether they synthesise any fluorinated compounds. It seemed from preliminary results that symbionts might play a role in the synthesis of the poisonous entities in D. cymosum, but further investigation is required. The detection of glandular lesions on the abaxial side of the leaf led to closer examination and the cross sections revealed unusually deformed epidermis cells with adjacent cells containing vacuoles filled with phenolic-like crystals. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the spongy parenchyma cells directly above the glandular lesions indicated the presence of clusters of small, virus-like particles (VLPs) in the chloroplasts. Observations by TEM showed that these VLPs have analogous structures to phytoferritin. Tapura fischeri (leafberry tree) is a tree member of the same family, and it was found to also contain a fluorinated compound. Endophytes were also found in the plant and similar glandular lesions with analogous VLPs were observed at these sites. This might indicate that endophytes have a share in the biosynthesis of the fluorinated compounds found in Dichapetalaceae. Numerous factors ought to be considered in order to fully understand the chemical ecology of the intricate system regarding the endophytes and the possible toxicity of the family Dichapetalaceae.

Effect {{of esters}} of organic acids on sporulation. J. Bacteriol. 85 : 1386 – 1393. 1963. —Sporulation of Bacillus cereus T in yeast extract-glucose-minerals medium was specifically inhibited by α-picolinic acid (APA), if the acid was added before the pH {{of the culture}} began to rise. The effects of APA could be reversed by aspartic acid or asparagine, among the amino acids, and by intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, {{with the exception of}} α-ketoglutarate and fumarate. Formate, malonate, and certain other organic acids also possessed this ability. Succinate was the best reversing agent. <b>Fluoroacetic</b> <b>acid</b> (FAA) also inhibited sporulation, but had no effect on vegetative growth or germination of spores of B. cereus T. Unlike APA, FAA inhibited sporulation even when added after the pH of the culture had started to rise. Bisulfite was similar to FAA in its effects on sporulation. With the exception of pyruvate, acetate, aspartate, and malate, most of the compounds reversing the effects of APA also overcame the effects of FAA or bisulfite on sporulation. Esters of some of the acids reversing the effects of the above inhibitors were studied for their action on germination, growth, and sporulation. Ethyl pyruvate prevented germination of the spores, slowed down growth, and inhibited sporulation. Ethyl malonate and ethyl succinate inhibited only sporulation. All the above inhibitors prevented the synthesis of dipicolinic acid (DPA) also. When B. cereus T was grown in the absence of glucose (in extracted yeast extract-minerals medium), the above inhibitors had no effect on sporulation. Ethyl oxamate permitted sporulation, but the spores produced were heat-sensitive. Ethyl pimelate caused lysis when added before the pH of the culture began to rise. When added after the pH of the culture began to rise, it also permitted sporulation, and the spores were sensitive to heat. (These heat-sensitive spores were refractile and dormant, and did not stain with crystal violet. However, they germinated normally, losing refractibility and became stainable.) The effect of ethyl oxamate and ethyl pimelate could be overcome by DPA. APA, FAA, ethyl malonate, and ethyl succinate also inhibit the sporulation of a number of other bacilli...|$|E
