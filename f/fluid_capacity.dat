In our experiment, the torque curve shows some unstableness. In some cases the transmitted torque is reduced very slowly for over 10 minutes.

40|$|Blowout preventers are {{designed}} to shut in a well under pressure so that formation fluids that have moved into the wellbore can be contained and circulated out while continuous control of the well is maintained. Control Systems for the BOPs are of necessity highly efficient hydraulic systems. The objective is to operate functions, such as closing rams, on the BOP stack in as short a time as possible. Supplying enough volume of pressured hydraulic fluid to operate those emergency functions is essential. To have the necessary quantity of control fluid under pressure requires storing this fluid in accumulators. These accumulators operate by the expansion and compression of nitrogen gas that is separated from hydraulic fluid by either rubber bladders or pistons. Accumulators are used both {{on the surface and}} at the seafloor. As long as you use accumulators on the surface or in relatively shallow waters, you may not {{have a problem with the}} volume of hydraulic <b>fluid</b> <b>capacity</b> of gas charged accumulators. The problem may arise when the wellhead is at water depth of more than 3500 ft. In deep water drilling, the accumulators should be placed on the subsea blowout preventer stack to reduce hydraulic response times and provide a hydraulic power supply in case of interruption of surface communication. Accumulators are also used in subsea production control systems to provide local storage that allows smaller line sizes in control umbilicals. Hydraulic <b>fluid</b> <b>capacity</b> of an accumulator drops to 15 % of its capacity on the surface and even less, depending on the water depth. A large number of accumulators are needed to perform BOP functions that could have been done by just a few of them on the surface or at relatively shallow water depth. Gas inside gas charged accumulators does not behave like an ideal gas as we go to very deep water, due to high hydrostatic pressure at that water depth. The higher the ambient pressure, the more the gas behaves like a real gas rather than an ideal gas and the lower the <b>fluid</b> <b>capacity</b> of the accumulators. Compressed gas has energy in it, and can release this energy at the time desired, that??s why it is used in accumulators. Now, we have to look for something that is able to store energy, but unlike the nitrogen, its functionality must not be affected by the increasing hydrostatic pressure of water as a function of water depth. Springs and heavy weights will be discussed as two options to replace nitrogen in accumulators. Efficient deep water accumulators would reduce the number of accumulators required in deepwater and cut the cost of the project. With the advent of such efficient accumulators, we can hope that one of the numerous problems of deepwater drilling has been solved and we can think of drilling in even deeper waters...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: Because {{pneumonectomy}} initiates compensatory {{growth of}} the remaining lung, we determined the time-dependent effects of pneumonectomy on alveolar <b>fluid</b> clearance <b>capacity.</b> Methods: Alveolar <b>fluid</b> clearance <b>capacity</b> with the Evans blue-labeled albumin concentration was measured in rats 3 hours, 2 days, 7 days, 14 days, and 28 days after left pneumonectomy. The mechanisms responsible for the increase in alveolar fluid clearance were explored. Results: Alveolar fluid clearance in the remaining lung was normal through 7 days and then increased 14 and 28 days after pneumonectomy. The increase in alveolar fluid clearance at 28 days after pneumonectomy was accounted primarily {{by an increase in}} amiloride-sensitive transport. The expression of epithelial sodium channel messenger RNA was increased in the remaining lung and in type II alveolar epithelial cells isolated from rats 28 days after pneumonectomy. The number of isolated type II cells was larger in pneumonectomized rats than in control rats. Also, β-adrenergic agonist therapy increased the rate of alveolar fluid clearance at the 3 -hour and 28 -day time points. Conclusions: The capacity to remove alveolar fluid in the remaining lung is maintained at a normal level for up to 7 days after pneumonectomy in a rat, and then there is a marked increase in amiloride-sensitive alveolar <b>fluid</b> transport <b>capacity</b> that might depend, at least in part, on increased expression of epithelial sodium channels in type II cells and in part on the increased number of type II cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The global {{need for}} disease {{detection}} and control has increased effort to engineer point-of-care (POC) tests that are simple, robust, affordable, and non-instrumented. In many POC tests, sample collection involves swabbing the site (e. g., nose, skin), agitating the swab in a fluid {{to release the}} sample, and transferring the fluid to a device for analysis. Poor performance in sample transfer can reduce sensitivity and reproducibility. METHODS: In this study, we compared bacterial release efficiency of seven swab types using manual-agitation methods typical of POC devices. Transfer efficiency was measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR) for Staphylococcus aureus under conditions representing a range of sampling scenarios: 1) spiking low-volume samples onto the swab, 2) submerging the swab in excess-volume samples, and 3) swabbing dried sample from a surface. RESULTS: Excess-volume samples gave the expected recovery for most swabs (based on tip fluid capacity); a polyurethane swab showed enhanced recovery, suggesting an ability to accumulate organisms during sampling. Dry samples led to recovery of ∼ 20 - 30 % for all swabs tested, suggesting that swab structure and volume is less important when organisms are applied to the outer swab surface. Low-volume samples led to the widest range of transfer efficiencies between swab types. Rayon swabs (63 µL capacity) performed well for excess-volume samples, but showed poor recovery for low-volume samples. Nylon (100 µL) and polyester swabs (27 µL) showed intermediate recovery for low-volume and excess-volume samples. Polyurethane swabs (16 µL) showed excellent recovery for all sample types. This work demonstrates that swab transfer efficiency can be affected by swab material, structure, and <b>fluid</b> <b>capacity</b> and details of the sample.

In this study, Acetobacter xylinum species isolated from Kombucha, a mixed culture was identified and isolated by streak plate method, Gram staining, morphology and formation of HALO area on CaCO 3 added differential media. It was confirmed by its ability to form pure cellulose in static fermentation. Optimum storing temperature of Acetobacter xylinum {{was found to be}} – 70 °C, retaining its activity and purity. In media optimization, control sample showed a dry yield of 1. 08 g/l/cm 2 at pH 5. 0 which was comparable with the yields of BC in coconut water supplemented with different carbon and nitrogen sources. Chemical structure of BC fibrils biosynthesized in different media confirmed a structure similar to pure cellulose by FTIR spectroscopy and SEM confirmed nano size and network structure. Mechanical tests revealed increased tensile strain from 0. 09 to 0. 339, decreased tensile stress from 52. 89 to 10. 93 Nm- 2 and Young’s modulus from 588. 93 to 32. 3 MPa when moisture content of BC was increased from 0 to 25 %. Fluid re-absorption in 24 hours decreased with increasing moisture content from 1342. 83 % to 175. 83 % and 919. 72 % to 114. 88 % in deionized water and saline respectively.
