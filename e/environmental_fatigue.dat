To evaluate these effects, the <b>environmental</b> <b>fatigue</b> life correction factor was established.

However, different results have been obtained for a sine strain wave in simulated BWR and PWR conditions.

For the purpose of verification, two approaches were applied. One is performing the <b>environmental</b> <b>fatigue</b> tests with the sine strain wave in simulated BWR condition.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to use LEFM {{in order to assess}} the detrimental influence of surrounding chloride-containing environments for stainless steels, hardened steel as well as for a cast aluminium alloy. An additional aim was also to use LEFM to assess the influence of porosity on the fatigue properties for different commercial cast aluminium alloys and manufacturing methods. The <b>environmental</b> influence on <b>fatigue</b> performance was mainly evaluated from fatigue crack growth measurements using compact tension (CT) specimens. In addition, fatigue performance in the high cycle regime was studied using spot welded specimens and smooth specimens. Corrosion fatigue tests for stainless steels were performed in different chloride-containing aqueous solutions and compared to the behaviour in air. Variables, which have been investigated, included temperature, redox potential and fatigue test frequency. The <b>environmental</b> influence on <b>fatigue</b> performance has also been compared to localised corrosion properties. Fatigue crack propagation rates were found to be higher in 3 % NaCl than in air for all stainless steels investigated. The highest alloyed austenitic steel, 654 SMO, showed the least influence of the environment. For duplex stainless steels the environment enhanced fatigue crack propagation rate to a higher degree than for austenitic stainless steels. This is explained by a material-dependent corrosion fatigue mechanism. In the high cycle regime, fatigue properties for spot welded stainless steels specimens were found to be decreased between 30 %- 40 % due to the presence of 3 % NaCl. For the hardened steel 100 CrMnMo 8 a fracture mechanics approach was employed for prediction of corrosion fatigue properties. In this model corrosion pit growth rate and the threshold stress intensity factor for fatigue crack propagation are needed as input parameters. For the high pressure die cast aluminium alloy the <b>environmental</b> influence of <b>fatigue</b> initiation through pre-exposure of smooth specimens was studied. Depending on environment used for pre-exposure, fatigue strength was found to be reduced by up to 50 % compared to the fatigue strength in air. Fatigue strength reduction was clearly associated to corrosion pits in the aluminium material. A fracture mechanics model was further successfully used to predict the environmental influence. The influence of porosity on the fatigue strength for the cast aluminium alloys tested has been described by a Kitagawa diagram. In design, the Kitagawa diagram can be used to predict the largest allowable pore size if the load situation in the component is known.

These {{are related to the}} damages due to occur in a structure resulting from accidental, <b>environmental</b> and <b>fatigue</b> damage, the latter being specifically a result of operational use. The article also emphasizes SHM to be considered as a system {{in the sense of a}} holistic approach not being just limited to damage monitoring only but also including loads monitoring and the aspects of prognostics in the sense of fatigue life evaluation. The article demonstrates that the ability to operate is core to an expensive structure such as an aircraft and that cost for inspection personnel and equipment become comparatively minor. A multi-step approach is described on how to determine SHM potentials which is then applied in two real test cases, the one being a major inspection (D-check) of a most popular civil aircraft type and the other the inspection of a so called 'drop-out', an inspection resulting from a service bulletin and hence being often outside the initially scheduled maintenance plan. It is concluded that it is mainly those drop-outs and ageing phenomena on aircraft in general not being part of a maintenance plan initially configured which turn out to be the most rewarding business cases for SHM...|$|R
