His powers of observation were blinded and his reasoning faculties so blunted by his prejudice in favor of anything psychic or occult that he could not, or would not, resist the influence.|$|E
25|$|There was no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Adelaide {{represent}} the very nadir of the Australian tour...The reasons behind {{the ease of}} their successful loss were fourfold: unenterprising captaincy, bad England batting, a good Lillee bowling performance {{and a lack of}} penetration in the depleted touring attack.|$|E

They raped me in front of my six children... Three years ago, I discovered I had HIV/AIDS. There is no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> I was infected during these rapes.|$|E

500|$|DeConcini later {{charged that}} McCain had {{leaked to the}} press {{sensitive}} information about the investigation that came {{from some of the}} closed proceedings of the Ethics Committee. McCain denied doing so under oath, although several press reports concluded that McCain {{had been one of the}} main leakers during that time. The GAO investigator later said, [...] "There is absolutely no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> McCain made those leaks." [...] Vice chair Rudman stated in his 1996 autobiography that McCain and his staff were responsible for some of the leaks, but later repudiated the assertion.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton's initial {{reply was}} accommodating: [...] "I {{would like to}} fall in with your views as far as {{possible}} without creating a position that would be untenable to myself". However, Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. [...] "I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided [...] "what limits he puts on his own rights". To this Shackleton replied: [...] "There is no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further".|$|E
500|$|Szilard and Zinn {{conducted}} a simple experiment {{on the seventh}} floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. Initially nothing registered on the oscilloscope, but then Zinn realized that it was not plugged in. On doing so, they discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible. Szilard later described the event: [...] "We turned the switch and saw the flashes. We watched them for a little while and then we switched everything off and went home." [...] He understood the implications and consequences of this discovery, though. [...] "That night, there was very little <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the world was headed for grief".|$|E

500|$|Wayne Kramer, a guitarist for MC5, {{suggested}} that Hendrix {{had been set}} up as part of a wide-scale crackdown on rock musicians: [...] "I don't have any <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the right-wing government forces were behind all of that... There was an effort, a movement, to stop this threat that rock and roll represented." [...] Hendrix was not the only prominent rock musician who found himself in legal trouble during May 1969. On May 16, the US embassy in London revoked John Lennon's visa in response to his 1968 drug conviction, describing him as [...] "an inadmissible immigrant". That same day, Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady was arrested for possession of marijuana, and on May 28, Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull were arrested at their London home for marijuana possession.|$|E
500|$|Contemporaries of Edwards {{have been}} unstinting in their praise of his abilities. Bobby Charlton {{described}} him as [...] "the only player {{that made me feel}} inferior" [...] and said his death was [...] "the biggest single tragedy ever to happen to Manchester United and English football". Terry Venables claimed that, had he lived, it would have been Edwards, not Bobby Moore, who lifted the World Cup trophy as England captain in 1966. Tommy Docherty stated that [...] "there is no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Duncan would have become the greatest player ever. Not just in British football, with United and England, but the best in the world. George Best was something special, as was Pelé and Maradona, but in my mind Duncan was much better in terms of all-round ability and skill." [...] In recognition of his talents Edwards was made an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002. [...] His memorabilia was exhibited at Dudley Museum prior to its closure, and was subsequently sold to Manchester United with a selection to be loaned back for display at the Dudley Archives.|$|E
500|$|Shadows Fall {{released}} their sixth album, Retribution, on September 15, 2009, {{through the}} band's own label, Everblack Industries, {{which was created}} in conjunction with Warner Music Group's ILG, Ferret Music and ChannelZERO Entertainment. It is being released in the UK via Spinefarm Records. The album was produced by Chris [...] "Zeuss" [...] Harris. Drummer Jason Bittner recently stated about the band's new material, [...] "The songs {{are a little more}} on the darker, angry side... lots of heaviness, lots of crazy guitar, and LOTS of room for me to have some fun. There is no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> this will be the best performance of my career, so far, and I owe that to my guys for bringing me incredible riffs to write killer drum parts to." [...] As of the fall of 2009 the band was appearing on the 'Shock & Raw' tour of North America with 2Cents, Otep & Five Finger Death Punch. After a South American tour, Shadows Fall will be playing on the Jägermeister Stage in the 2010 Rockstar Mayhem Festival in July and August 2010. The band is also scheduled to support Lamb of God on their Australian tour in December 2009 Shadows Fall is pleased to announce their first and only New York City performance this year, taking place at Santos Party House on December 18, 2010 with direct support from Thy Will Be Done.|$|E

There is no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> this order originated with Ben-Gurion.

The road to the prime ministership of this nation is a long and hard road. It's not an easy one. And there are many twists and turns on that road.

2500|$|In May 2002, Adam Gilchrist, {{speaking}} at a Carlton (Australian) Football Club luncheon, claimed Muralitharan's action does not comply with the laws of cricket. The Melbourne-based Age newspaper quoted Gilchrist as saying."Yeah, I think he does (chuck), and I say that because, {{if you read the}} laws of the game, there's no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> he and many others, throughout cricket history have." [...] These comments were made before the doosra controversy, in spite of Muralitharan's action having been cleared by ICC in both 1996 and 1999. For his comment Gilchrist was reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) and found guilty of being in breach of ACB rules concerned with [...] "detrimental public comment".|$|E

Bud Smyth, a former race marshal and Iditarod musher, criticized race officials, saying the Iditarod officials were slow to interview and tape record witnesses. Musher Perry Solmonson stated [...] "It is just a sad situation, I hope as a board you will have some integrity and do what is necessary for the dogs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, a TV critic {{writing in}} the New York Daily News solved the mystery, {{publishing}} {{a photo of the}} alleged assailant, William Tager, who received a -to-25-year prison sentence for killing NBC stagehand Campbell Montgomery outside The Today Show studio in 1994. Rather confirmed the story: [...] "There's no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> this is the person." [...] New York District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau said, [...] "William Tager's identity as the man who attacked Mr. Rather was established in the course of an investigation by my office." [...] Tager claimed he thought television networks were beaming signals into his brain. When he murdered the stagehand, Tager was trying to force his way into an NBC studio with a weapon, in order to find out the frequency the networks were using to attack him, so that he could block it. Tager was paroled in October 2010 and is believed to be living in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Truscott was shocked, writing later [...] "...I was dumbfounded. This {{was no time}} {{to drive}} to the north-west where the enemy was still strong; we should pour our maximum power into the Valmontone Gap to insure the {{destruction}} of the retreating German Army. I would not comply with the order without first talking to General Clark in person. ... he was not on the beachhead and could not be reached even by radio.... such was the order that turned the main effort of the beachhead forces from the Valmontone Gap and prevented destruction of the German Tenth Army. On the 26th the order was put into effect." [...] He went on to write [...] "There has never been any <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> had General Clark held loyally to General Alexander's instructions, had he not changed the direction of my attack to the north-west on May26, the strategic objectives of Anzio would have been accomplished in full.

2500|$|That same day, Jean {{responded with}} a public statement, saying [...] "I wish to tell you {{unequivocally}} that both my husband and I are proud to be Canadian {{and that we have}} the greatest respect for the institutions of our country. We are fully committed to Canada. I would not have accepted this position otherwise... have never belonged to a political party or the separatist movement," [...] and {{went on to say that}} in the documented footage she had been speaking about Haiti, and not Quebec. Martin added on his earlier comments: [...] "There is no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> her devotion to Canada is longstanding and resolute," [...] though some critics continued to argue that Jean's response had been too vague. By late August, polls showed that there had been a 20% drop in support for the recommendation of Jean as the next governor general, in response to which the Haitian community voiced their support for Jean, even holding special church services in her honour. Jean reaffirmed in late 2010 that the rumours of her separatist sympathies were untrue and revealed that she had been upset by those journalists who she saw as capitalizing on sensationalism, rather than seeking accuracy through investigation, but she had been advised repeatedly not to respond.|$|E
2500|$|Rolling Stones {{lead singer}} Mick Jagger, {{who had already}} been punched {{in the head by}} a concertgoer within seconds of {{emerging}} from his helicopter, was visibly intimidated by the unruly situation and urged everyone to, [...] "Just be cool down in the front there, don't push around." [...] During the third song, [...] "Sympathy for the Devil", a fight erupted {{in the front of the}} crowd at the foot of the stage, prompting the Stones to pause their set while the Angels restored order. After a lengthy pause and another appeal for calm, the band restarted the song and continued their set with less incident until the start of [...] "Under My Thumb". Some of the Hells Angels got into a scuffle with Meredith Hunter, age 18, when he attempted to get onstage with other fans. One of the Hells Angels grabbed Hunter's head, punched him, and chased him back into the crowd. [...] After a minute's pause, Hunter returned to the stage [...] where, according to Gimme Shelter producer Porter Bibb, Hunter's girlfriend Patty Bredehoft found him and tearfully begged him to calm down and move further back in the crowd with her; but he was reportedly enraged, irrational and so high he could barely walk. Rock Scully, who could see the audience clearly from the top of a truck by the stage, said of Hunter, [...] "I saw what he was looking at, that he was crazy, he was on drugs, and that he had murderous intent. There was no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> he intended to do terrible harm to Mick or somebody in the Rolling Stones, or somebody on that stage." ...|$|E
