5|$|Every {{configuration}} of Rule 90 has exactly four predecessors, other configurations {{that form the}} given configuration after a single step. Therefore, in contrast to many other cellular automata such as Conway's Game of Life, Rule 90 has no <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eden,</b> a configuration with no predecessors. It {{provides an example of}} a cellular automaton that is surjective (each configuration has a predecessor) but not injective (it has sets of more than one configuration with the same successor), showing that the converse of the <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> theorem is not true.|$|E

He persuades Eve to try one when God (Ned Flanders) witnesses his sin. Even though Adam ate many apples, God only caught Eve eating an apple, and she is therefore banished from the <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eden.</b> Adam is unwilling to come clean, but misses Eve and thinks {{of a way of}} getting her back in by digging a tunnel with the help of some of the animals. God's unicorn, named Gary, becomes exhausted from the digging and dies just before God catches Adam trying to smuggle Eve back into the Garden. The death of the unicorn enrages him further, and he expels them both from the <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eden.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Rule 90, on an {{infinite}} one-dimensional lattice, every configuration has exactly four predecessor configurations. This is because, in a predecessor, any two consecutive cells may have {{any combination of}} states, but once those two cells' states are chosen, {{there is only one}} consistent choice for the states of the remaining cells. Therefore, there is no <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> in Rule 90, a configuration with no predecessors. The Rule 90 configuration consisting of a single nonzero cell (with all other cells zero) has no predecessors that have finitely many nonzeros. However, this configuration is not a <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> because it does have predecessors with infinitely many nonzeros.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after {{completing}} The Road to Glory, Hawks began writing his next film, Fig Leaves, his first (and, until 1935, only) comedy. The film portrays {{a married couple}} by juxtaposing them in the <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> and in modern New York City. The <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> humorously depicts Adam and Eve awoken by a Flintstones-like coconut alarm clock and Adam reading the morning news on giant stone tablets. In the modern day, the biblical serpent is replaced by Eve's gossiping neighbor and Eve becomes a sexy flapper and fashion model when Adam is at work. The film starred George O'Brien as Adam and Olive Borden as Eve and received positive reviews, particularly for the art direction and costume designs. It was released in July 1926 and was Hawks's first hit as a director. Although he mainly dismissed his early work, Hawks praised this film in later interviews.|$|E

40|$|Michelene Wandor is {{best known}} for her {{critical}} writings on gender in the British theatre, but Wandor {{is also the author of}} short stories, plays, and two collections of poetry, and her creative works reiterate and reinforce many of the issues and themes present in her theatrical criticism. It is unfortunate that Wandor 2 ̆ 7 s poetry is generally overlooked, for the poems, particularly <b>Gardens</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eden,</b> mirror her growth as a writer and as a feminist, explore the role of feminism in her creative process, and reveal the connections between her art and her political beliefs.

It not only represents the difficulties faced by many female poets writing in Britain since the 1960 s, especially those who became part of the feminist movement, but also explores some of the aspects of Biblical interpretations which are bringing many new scholars to the study of the Old Testament. It also reflects the feelings of many contemporary women who are at odds not only with traditional interpretations of female characters, but with the ways in which these interpretations support outmoded and archaic ideas about women. As part of an ongoing movement in Biblical interpretation, <b>Gardens</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> is as important now as it was when it was written. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{fact that}} every {{configuration}} has a predecessor may be summarized {{by saying that}} Rule 90 is surjective. The function that maps each configuration to its successor is, mathematically, a surjective function. Rule 90 is also not injective. In an injective rule, every two different configurations have different successors, but Rule 90 has pairs of configurations with the same successor. Rule 90 {{provides an example of}} a cellular automaton that is surjective but not injective. The <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> theorem of Moore and Myhill implies that every injective cellular automaton must be surjective, but this example shows that the converse is not true.|$|E

God granted it the power of speech and placed it {{at the top of}} Abu Qubays, a mountain in the historic region of Khurasan, before moving the mountain to Mecca. When Ibrahim took the Black Stone from Abu Qubays to build the Kaaba, the mountain asked Ibrahim to intercede with God so {{that it would not be}} returned to Khurasan and would stay in Mecca.|$|E

5|$|Martin, Odlyzko, and Wolfram {{investigate}} pseudoforests {{that model}} {{the dynamics of}} cellular automata. These functional graphs, which they call state transition diagrams, have one vertex for each possible configuration that the ensemble of cells of the automaton can be in, and an edge connecting each configuration to the configuration that follows it according to the automaton's rule. One can infer properties of the automaton from the structure of these diagrams, such {{as the number of}} components, length of limiting cycles, depth of the trees connecting non-limiting states to these cycles, or symmetries of the diagram.

5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden tells {{a mythical}} saga of life's {{evolution}} on Earth, with a subtext of a creation myth and polytheistic evolution.

As the game progresses, it soon becomes apparent some mysterious external force is interfering with evolution on Earth in a destructive manner. Strange crystals not native to Gaia appear across the planet, and creatures that eat the crystals are transformed into monstrously powerful beings that dominate all other lifeforms, overconsume resources and disrupt the flow of evolution. In each Age the player character is tasked with confronting the species transformed by the crystals and defeating them so that the evolution of life can continue as intended.|$|E

If this naming was inspired by the Scriptures, it also set up the basis of an experiment which was meant to be exceptional. Future colonists and pioneers therefore logically pursued the enterprise, founding dozens of new Salems, Sharons, Zions, and Paradises. Still today, realtors – not unsurprisingly - advertise various Shangri La Estates, <b>Gardens</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eden</b> and Salem Houses.
