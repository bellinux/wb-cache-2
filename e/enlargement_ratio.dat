30|$|The PRoject for On Board Autonomy (PROBA) {{spacecraft}} is a mini-satellite {{operated by}} the European Space Agency. The main payload of PROBA is the Compact High Resolution Imaging s Spectrometer (CHRIS) sensor which can acquire up to 63 spectral bands (400 – 1, 050 nm) with nominal spatial resolutions of 17 or 34 m at nadir, depending on the acquisition mode. The CHRIS sensor acquires data in five different modes (aerosol, land cover, vegetation and coastal zones), varying the number and location of spectral bands, the spatial resolution and {{the width of the}} swath. Thus, the CHRIS-PROBA system acquires HS images of the same scene with five different view angles during a single overpass: + 55 °, + 36 °, 0 °, - 36 ° and - 55 °. To test the proposed approach a 0 ° image, acquired in Land-Cover mode (18 bands), was used. The spectral ranges of the two images are very similar, 438 – 1, 035 nm for CHRIS and 405 – 1, 053 nm for the QuickBird-PAN, respectively. Also the angles of view of the two images are very similar, thus avoiding any geometric or registration distortions between the two images. The CHRIS image was atmospherically corrected and accurately co-registered to the PAN image for testing. In particular, the atmospheric correction consists of estimating the contribution of the atmospheric effects in terms of the total irradiance, the direct and diffuse transmittance, and the radiance due to the scattering. The estimations have been produced starting from simulations carried out with the suite of libraries libRadtran for the simulation of the radiative transfer balance[30]. A subset of 216 × 216 pixels for the CHRIS image and 864 × 864 for the PAN image was selected according to the overlapping areas of the two acquisitions. To obtain an <b>enlargement</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4, that, respect to the description of the Indusion method, offers the best tradeoff between spatial enhancement and spectral distortion[26], the CHRIS image and the PAN image have been degraded to the spatial resolutions of 20 and 5 m, respectively adhering to the consistency criteria of quality assessment as proposed by Wald[1].|$|E

The device is made of a molecule (modeled as a quantum dot with discrete energy levels) which is asymmetrically coupled to the two metallic electrodes through the tunnel junctions. Electrical rectification follows from the combined effect of the geometric asymmetry in the molecular structure and simultaneously in the electrostatic potential spatial profile. Primarily the influence of broadening and charging effects on the charge and transport characteristics are investigated. Consequence of the broadening is to smooth the charge-voltage (N-V) and current voltage (I-V) functions, while the charging effect is rather responsible for the change of the slope of both N-V and I-V curves.

This research {{is a comprehensive}} investigation encompassing land use changes in an agricultural watershed and corresponding changes to the rainfall-runoff relationship and stream channel morphology. The Lac qui Parle (LqP) watershed is one of eleven major watersheds within the Minnesota River Basin (MRB). Agriculture is the dominant land use within the MRB occurring on more than 90 -percent of the landscape. This research investigates the spatial and temporal changes in channel morphology and land use between 1965 / 66 and 2002 / 03. Historical data {{were obtained from the}} US Army Corps of Engineers for the South Fork Lac qui Parle (SF LqP) River. Sixty-five cross-section sites were re-surveyed and evaluated. Current channel morphology was assessed through a second year of data collection. Additional data were collected and analyzed for crop history, riparian vegetation, agricultural drainage, annual discharge, annual peak discharge, and monthly and annual precipitation. Results indicate crop diversity within the SF LqP River has diminished and is currently dominated by corn and soybean. Surface and subsurface drainage of agricultural lands was documented on 37 -percent of the sub-watershed area evaluated. Analysis of the discharge and precipitation records indicates an increase in the Q/P ratio and average annual runoff volume post- 1960. The analysis indicates land use changes within the SF LqP watershed have impacted the channel morphology of the SF LqP River post- 1965 / 66. Significant changes in channel cross-sectional area were noted in the Middle and Upper watersheds. Results corresponds to a channel <b>enlargement</b> <b>ratio</b> (CER) of 1. 02 - 1. 30. Changes in cultivation practices and drainage activities correspond with higher CER of 2. 32 - 2. 6. Similar increases were noted for peak discharge (1. 30 - 1. 35). CERs match values developed for storm sewered streets in urbanized areas. All changes were significant at the 95 -% confidence level. A separate investigation evaluated the use of natural channel design for agricultural ditches. Results indicate natural channel design provides more efficient sediment transport, increased channel diversity/complexity, and may reduce channel maintenance costs...|$|E

An unusual feature was complete encasement of the heart by tumour. No satisfactory treatment is available. Case report A 69 year old retired seaman gave a two month his-tory of progressively worsening breathlessness and central chest discomfort on effort. There was associ-ated weight loss, anorexia, night sweats, and pro-nounced peripheral oedema. Symptoms were partly relieved by diuretics and vasodilators. Previous illnesses included longstanding, but well controlled, hypertension (treated with atenolol and hydralazine) and resection of an enlarged prostate two years before presentation, in which histological examination showed foci of well differentiated pros-tatic adenocarcinoma. On examination he was unwell, slightly jaundiced, and dyspnoeic at rest. The pulse was regular and of small volume, and the blood pressure was 90 / 60 mm Hg. The jugular venous pulse was elevated to {{the angle of the}} jaw, with sharp "y" descent and there was pitting oedema up to the knees.

COPD exacerbations are critical events in {{the natural history of}} the disease, accounting for the majority of disease burden, cost, and mortality. Pulmonary vascular disease is an important risk factor for disease progression and exacerbation risk. Relative pulmonary artery enlargement on computed tomography scan, defined by a pulmonary artery to aortic (PA:A) ratio > 1, has been evaluated as a marker of pulmonary vascular disease. The PA:A ratio can be measured reliably independent of electrocardiographic gating or the use of contrast, and in healthy patients a PA:A ratio > 0. 9 is considered to be abnormal. The PA:A ratio has been compared with invasive hemodynamic parameters, primarily mean pulmonary artery pressure in various disease conditions and is more strongly correlated with mean pulmonary artery pressure in obstructive as compared with interstitial lung disease. In patients without known cardiac or {{pulmonary disease}}, the PA:A ratio is predictive of mortality, while in COPD, an elevated PA:A ratio is correlated with increased exacerbation risk, outperforming other well established predictors of these events. Future studies should be aimed at determining the stability of the metric over time and evaluating the utility of the PA:A ratio in guiding specific therapies.

40|$|ObjectiveReoperations on aortic valves are {{associated}} with increased mortality, which may affect valve prosthesis selection {{at the time of}} initial aortic valve replacement. We analyzed our experience to determine whether reoperation itself independently predicts mortality during aortic valve surgery. MethodsDemographic, intraoperative, and outcome data were collected prospectively on patients undergoing primary or redo aortic valve replacement or Bentall procedures after previous aortic valve replacement with or without concomitant coronary bypass grafting at a single institution from 1990 through 2002. Logistic regression analyses validated by means of bootstrap methodology identified the predictors of hospital mortality and the independent effect of reoperation. ResultsOf 2673 patients undergoing aortic valve surgery, 2375 were primary operations, 216 were reoperations, and 82 were Bentall–after–aortic valve replacement procedures. Of 298 reoperations, 32 were third and 5 were fourth procedures. Mortality was 2. 3 % for primary operations, 4. 6 % for redo aortic valve replacement, and 2. 4 % for Bentall–after–aortic valve replacement procedures. Most patients underwent elective procedures, with mortalities of 1. 6 %, 1. 7 %, and 2. 5 %, respectively. Hospital mortality was independently predicted by peripheral vascular disease (odds ratio, 3. 6), active endocarditis (odds ratio, 2. 9), worsening New York Heart Association class (odds ratio, 2. 3), and need for annular <b>enlargement</b> (odds <b>ratio,</b> 2. 1). Reoperation itself did not predict hospital mortality. ConclusionsThe risk of mortality during aortic valve surgery is due mostly to active endocarditis, New York Heart Association class, and comorbidity.

40|$|Background Among studies {{describing}} the phenotype of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C), significant discrepancy exists regarding {{the extent and}} impact of left ventricular (LV) involvement. The capability of conventional and new quantitative echocardiographic techniques to accurately detect LV involvement in ARVD/C remains unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that accurate detection of LV involvement on echocardiography identifies patients at additional risk for cardiac events during follow-up. Methods Thirty-eight patients with ARVD/C, 16 pathogenic mutation-positive relatives, and 55 healthy control subjects were prospectively enrolled. Conventional echocardiography with additional deformation imaging was performed in all subjects to detect LV involvement. In a subgroup (n = 27), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed with late enhancement. All patients and relatives were prospectively followed for events (sustained ventricular tachycardia, appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator intervention, sudden cardiac death, and heart transplantation). Results Conventional echocardiography detected LV involvement in 32 % of patients with ARVD/C and in none of the relatives. Deformation imaging revealed LV involvement in 68 % of patients with ARVD/C and 25 % of relatives and was correlated closely with late enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. During a mean follow-up period of 5. 9 ± 2. 3 years, 20 patients with ARVD/C (53 %) experienced events, and no events occurred in the relatives. LV involvement detected by deformation imaging (hazard ratio, 4. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 7 - 14. 2) and right ventricular outflow tract <b>enlargement</b> (hazard <b>ratio,</b> 1. 2; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 1. 3) were the only independent predictors of outcomes.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, EDI {{techniques}} calculate the directional correlation between neighboring pixels to perform interpolation along estimated edge directions. These EDI approaches {{have been widely}} used for deinterlacing[13, 14] and upscaling[15 – 17]. Especially, edge-dependent deinterlacing algorithms such as edge-based line average are the most popular among the intra-field deinterlacing methods. Many sophisticated techniques for both deinterlacing and upscaling have been proposed to increase the accuracy of the estimated edge directions because EDI approaches can improve visual quality around dominant edges when the estimated edge direction is correct. However, high computational loads are required to estimate the directions of the various diagonal edges, and thus, upscaling applications become more complicated than deinterlacing applications. Furthermore, for achieving arbitrary <b>ratio</b> <b>enlargement,</b> the EDI process generally becomes more complicated since edge direction estimation and interpolation are performed within an asymmetric interpolation lattice. Therefore, upscaling EDI methods usually restrict the scaling ratio in order to simplify the interpolation process, e.g., images are enlarged twice as much as the original images in both horizontal and vertical directions. With fixed scaling ratios, some researchers[15 – 17] estimate the covariance of high-resolution images by exploiting the covariance of low-resolution images. These methods can substantially improve the image quality by preserving the spatial coherence of the upscaled images. They also provide natural-looking images by efficiently connecting the disconnected edges. However, these algorithms may introduce some false edges or textures due to over-fitting. They can sometimes connect the edges erroneously due to their incorrect estimation of covariance because spatial correlations generally change after downsampling.|$|R

BackgroundPrognostic importance of exercise induced LV diastolic dysfunction remains uncertain. Patients and methodsWe studied 147 elderly patients (73 ± 5 years) who underwent treadmill stress echocardiography. Patients with exercise induced LV wall motion abnormality were not included. Doppler and tissue Doppler measurements were done before treadmill exercise and immediately after the post-stress image acquisition, and E/E′ ratio was measured. Raised E/E′ was defined as E/E′≥ 15, and left atrial (LA) enlargement was defined as LA volume index≥ 34 ml/m 2. Using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, predictor of new-onset AF was determined. Using Kaplan–Meier analysis, we evaluated association between raised post-exercise E/E′ or LA enlargement with new-onset AF. ResultsDuring the follow-up period (median= 67 months), there were 25 new-onset AF. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that male gender [hazard ratio (HR) 3. 294; p= 0. 0117], LA enlargement (HR 3. 576; p= 0. 0017), and raised post-exercise E/E′ (HR 3147; p= 0. 0068) were the best predictors of new-onset AF. Kaplan–Meier survival plot demonstrated that patients with both LA enlargement and raised post-exercise E/E′ developed new-onset AF most frequently. There {{was no significant difference}} in outcome between patients with isolated raised post-exercise E/E′ or isolated LA <b>enlargement.</b> ConclusionsRaised E/E′ <b>ratio</b> after exercise provides significant prognostic information for predicting new-onset AF in non-ischemic elderly patients.

40|$|The Yzeron basin (147 km²) {{consists}} of three major units: 1) in the west, the Monts du Lyonnais, a subdued mountain whose land is predominantly rural; 2) in the center, the Plateau Lyonnais, a plateau over {{a large part of}} which extends the current periurban belt of Lyon; 3) in the east, the paleovalley of the Rhône and Saône Rivers, most of which is occupied by a dense urbanization. Many incisions have been identified using field indicators and downstream hydraulic geometry relationships (space-time substitution technique). All incised reaches are located in headwater streams (1 st and 2 nd Strahler order). Incisions are more important on the Plateau Lyonnais where they were mainly caused by impervious surfaces and storm sewer outlets. The effect of urbanization is also emphasized by dendrochronological analyses of riparian trees showing that these incisions mostly began between 1970 and 1990. Indeed, urban areas have doubled during this period over the entire Yzeron basin, rising from 15 to 30 % (Radojevic et al. 2002), and this average increase was probably higher on the plateau which had in the same time the highest relative population growth. On the plateau, no incision was identified in the basins which impervious cover is less than 10 %, threshold already observed by several authors in different regions (Schueler 1995 after Doll et al. 2002, Booth et Jackson 1997, Bledsoe et al. 2001 a, Coleman et al. 2005). Nevertheless, one third of the incisions (as a percentage of total length of incised reaches) were also identified in the Monts du Lyonnais where urbanization is poorly developed. In this area, riparian trees growth was not affected by bed lowering so we cannot date the incisions. Nevertheless, small dimensions of incised channels and their stage of evolution suggest that it is also relatively recent incisions, although their origins can back several decades, even centuries. Indeed, the study of historical land use evolution shows that croplands, especially arable land (cereal crops mainly) and vines, were much more developed in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. Moreover, the age of human settlements in the Lyon region, as well as some historical archives (Privolt 2010; N. Jacob, personal communication), suggest that these croplands were extensive well before the 19 th century. This may have contributed for centuries to soil erosion on the slopes and sedimentary fill of the valley bottoms. This is even more likely that croplands were mainly on slopes while valley bottoms, wetter, were generally in meadows. Then, higher roughness valley bottom was favorable to the deposit of particles eroded by runoff on cultivated slopes (colluviums) or carried by overflows during flood (alluviums). Land use data indicates a significant decrease in agricultural land, especially vineyards and plowed fields, during the 20 th century. In the Monts du Lyonnais, these have mainly been replaced by grasslands and, more recently, by afforestation. This change has greatly reduced runoff and soil erosion, leading to a relative sediment deficit that contributes to disrupt channel stability. In addition, bed aggradation in valley bottoms which experienced initially sedimentary fill (headwater basins, with a gentle slope and a greater width) has resulted in a local slope increase with downstream reaches whose energy is relatively stronger (no deposits), which ultimately promotes regressive incisions. In the Plateau Lyonnais, croplands have also been replaced by urban areas. Then, when urbanization extends after long-term effects of cropland, the latter two disturbances are cumulative and may result in incisions highly developed, as for example in the Chaudanne River. Furthermore, whatever the land use, artificial drainage networks (roads, trails, storm sewers) can lead to incisions. These are all longer than drains length and valleybottom slope increases. This trend could be related to the low availability of mobile sediment in the bed and banks: as water inputs increases with drain length, more distance is necessary to satisfy sediment transport capacity because it cannot be fully satisfied by erosion in the vertical and lateral dimensions; when slope increases, channels have more coarse material resistant to erosion and lower lateral dynamics, which promotes further adjustments in longitudinal dimension. The secondary influence of slope may be related to soil thickness and basin size: in general, soil thickness is lower in steep valley bottoms so that artificial drains are more able to intercept subsurface runoff; steep valley bottoms are also associated with smaller basins where subsurface runoff is usually dominant so that surface runoff increase may be higher after roads or trails development. Moreover, influence of basin size was clearly highlighted even among low order streams: there is no incision beyond 4 km², and this threshold drops to 2 km² for most streams in the Monts du Lyonnais. Small streams are thus more sensitive to hydrologic disturbances, i. e. all human interventions that help to reduce infiltration and to intercept subsurface runoff. Geomorphic sensitivity to incision depends also to valley bottom morphology that can be described by a typological approach (Schmitt et al. 2004). Our results highlight the usefulness of this hydrogeomorphic typology, combined with the drainage area, to quickly identify stream reaches potentially sensitive to incision. Hydrological effects of combined sewer overflows on streambed stability were studied in the Chaudanne River where the largest incision was identified. Combined sewer overflows increase frequency and intensity of most morphogenic floods (above the critical discharge) but it is not accompanied by an equivalent increase of their annual duration. It also tends to reduce discharges at low flow and the annual duration of low intensity floods, at least compared to largest floods. This causes a change in the relative geomorphic effectiveness of discharges of different intensities. Channels must therefore adjust to significantly higher discharges, but short, delaying the recovery of a new morphodynamic equilibrium (longer relaxation time). This may also explain the nature of the channel response, i. e. a large incision rather than a gradual adjustment of its size. Although incised reaches extend only over a relatively small part of the Yzeron hydrographic network (6 %), channel <b>enlargement</b> <b>ratios</b> are significant (11, 7 on average) and eroded banks are mainly composed of sand (53 % on average). Headwater channel incisions are therefore an important source of fine sediment for the main branches of the river system (3 rd to 5 th Strahler order), with sandy sedimentation problems. According to fluorescent sand tracking, sediment delivery from upstream incised reaches represents from 27 to 62 % of the annual sediment transport of the Yzeron River for the fraction 0, 5 - 4 mm (66 % of downstream sand deposits). Despite the uncertainties in sediment transport estimates, this result suggests that headwater channel incisions are a major problem for instream physical habitat given the low capacity of the system to remove these sediments. Transport capacity of the main branches is also greatly reduced by a large number of weirs. When the bed slope is low, these structures systematically result in a sandy bed of several tens or even hundreds of meters. Finally, we have formulated various operational recommendations to limit hydrogeomorphic impacts due to anthropization, and especially urbanization. These recommendations are based on three scales of intervention: hillslopes, headwater stream channels and main branches of the river network. The proposed measures aim in particular to slow down or temporarily store waterflows on hillslopes, to control and adjust the long profile of incised reaches in case of local issues, and to trap some of the sand load upstream reaches most sensitive to sand deposits. Le bassin de l'Yzeron (147 km²) est composé de trois grands ensembles : 1) à l'ouest, les Monts du Lyonnais essentiellement ruraux; 2) au centre, le Plateau Lyonnais, sur une grande partie duquel s'étend l'actuelle couronne périurbaine de l'agglomération lyonnaise; 3) à l'est, la paléovallée du Rhône et de la Saône, dont la majeure partie est occupée par une urbanisation dense. Un grand nombre d'incisions ont été identifiées à l'aide d'indicateurs visuels et des relations de géométrie hydraulique aval (space-time substitution technique). L'ensemble des tronçons incisés se situe sur les cours d'eau de tête de bassin (ordre 1 ou 2 selon Strahler). Les incisions sont plus importantes sur le Plateau Lyonnais où elles ont principalement été engendrées par l'imperméabilisation des sols et le développement des réseaux de drainage artificiels. Le rôle de l'urbanisation est également souligné par les analyses dendrochronologiques des arbres riverains qui montrent que les incisions ont principalement débuté entre 1970 et 1990. En effet, la superficie des zones urbaines a doublé durant cette période dans le bassin de l'Yzeron (Radojevic et al. 2002), et cette progression moyenne a probablement été supérieure sur le plateau qui a connu la plus forte croissance démographique relative. Sur le plateau, aucune incision n'a été identifiée dans les bassins dont le taux d'imperméabilisation est inférieur à 10 %, seuil déjà observé par plusieurs auteurs dans différentes régions (Schueler 1995 d'après Doll et al. 2002, Booth et Jackson 1997, Bledsoe et al. 2001 a, Coleman et al. 2005). Néanmoins, un tiers des incisions (en pourcentage de la longueur totale des tronçons incisés) se situent également dans les Monts du Lyonnais où l'urbanisation s'est très peu développée. Dans cette unité paysagère, la croissance des arbres riverains n'a pas été affectée par l'abaissement du niveau du lit si bien que nous n'avons pas pu dater les incisions.
