Due to the introduction of a new generalized floating exchange rate system by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that stretched a smaller role of gold in the international monetary system in 1978, this fixed parity system as a monetary co-operation policy was terminated. The Thai government amended its monetary policies to be more in line with the new IMF policy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between health status and insurance participation, and between insurance status and medical use {{in the context of}} a social health insurance with an <b>equalization</b> <b>fund</b> (SHIEF). Under this system, revenues from a mandatory payroll tax are collected into a single pool (<b>equalization</b> <b>fund)</b> that reimburses for-profit insurance companies according to a capitated formula. Although competition should induce insurers to control costs without reducing the quality of service necessary to attract consumers, limitations in the capitation formula might induce insurers to select against bad risks, and limitations in the contribution system might induce more healthy individuals to evade enrollment. A three-equation model having social health insurance, private health insurance, and using medical services is estimated using a 1997 Colombian household survey. Consistent with similar studies, participation in SHIEF increases medical care use. On the other hand, the evidence on selection is somewhat mixed: individuals who report good health status are more likely to participate in SHIEF, while those without a chronic condition are less likely to participate in SHIEF.

40|$|Since 1991, the Russian {{system of}} federal {{intergovernmental}} transfers {{has moved from}} equalizing to counter-equalizing, both {{in the case of}} regional revenue equalization {{and in the case of}} regional personal income equalization.

The counter-equalizing effect has been weaker in real terms than in nominal terms indicating that regional price differentials have impicitly been taken into account. The main reasons for increasing counter-equalization seem to be: (i) a relatively small share of transfers in the budget and GDP; (ii) flaws in the equalization formula resulting in the lack of sufficient focus on the poorest regions; and (iii) a non-transparent character of other transfers redistributing often to the most politically powerful regions. The major recommendations for the future are (i) to increase (dramatically) the transparency of expenditure assignment, and (ii) to keep the system simple. ...|$|R
