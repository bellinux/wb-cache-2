25|$|The {{series was}} immensely popular, helped by Lang's {{reputation}} as a folklorist and by the packaging device of the uniform books. The series proved of great influence in children's literature, increasing the popularity of fairy tales over tales of real life. It inspired such imitators as English Fairy Tales (1890) and More English Fairy Tales (1894) by Joseph Jacobs. Other followers included the American The Oak-Tree Fairy Book (1905), The Elm-Tree Fairy Book (1909), and The <b>Fir-Tree</b> Fairy Book (1912) series edited by Clifton Johnson, and the collections of Kate Douglas Wiggin and Nora Archibald Smith.|$|E
2500|$|The 20th century {{saw some}} {{innovations}} in lines of partition. [...] Erablé, {{a series of}} alternating upside-down and rightside-up maple-leaves, is a typically Canadian line of partition, though the College of Arms in London has used it in a few grants (but compare the cross nowy erablé {{in the arms of}} Katherina Fahlman Selinger Schaaf. [...] A Finnish line of partition, invented by Kaj Cajander and called kuusikoro, which is called <b>fir-tree</b> topped in Britain, and which the Canadian Heraldic Authority coined the term sapiné to blazon, resembles fir trees; in the arms of Guy Selvester [...] this is called sapinage. [...] A line resembling fir twigs, and so called in British blazon, is called sapinagy in Canada (though sadly there is no example of it in the online Canadian Public Register), and havukoro in Finland.) [...] Other 20th-century examples of lines, or things akin to lines, include the 1990 grant to Albersdorf-Prebuch, also in Austria, in which the upper line of the fess takes the form of fruit, the bottom of vine-leaves. [...] (It is debatable what the distinction is between such lines, and examples such as the [...] of Bierbaum am Auersbach, a town in Styria, in which three pears grow from a pall.) ...|$|E

60|$|He waited, {{while the}} <b>fir-trees</b> rubbed and prodded {{the base of}} the tower, and the wind roared around and shook it; but she could not find words to reply.|$|R
60|$|Deserted by her father, {{the poor}} girl sat down under a <b>fir-tree</b> {{at the edge}} of the forest and began to weep silently. Suddenly she heard a faint sound: it was King Frost {{springing}} from tree to tree, and cracking his fingers as he went. At length he reached the <b>fir-tree</b> beneath which she was sitting, and with a crisp crackling sound he alighted beside her, and looked at her lovely face.|$|E
6000|$|In spring, {{when the}} {{swallows}} and storks came, the <b>fir-tree</b> asked them, 'Do {{you know where}} they were taken? Have you met them?' ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was not a}} bad guess, but the <b>fir-tree</b> {{had real}} bark-ache from sheer longing, and bark-ache in trees is just as bad as head-ache in human beings.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! if I {{were only}} a great tree like the others!' sighed the little <b>fir-tree,</b> 'then I could stretch out my {{branches}} far and wide and look out into the great world! The birds would build their nests in my branches, and when the wind blew I would bow to it politely just like the others!' It took no pleasure in the sunshine, nor in the birds, nor in the rose-coloured clouds that sailed over it at dawn and at sunset. Then the winter came, and the snow lay white and sparkling all around, and a hare would come and spring right over the little <b>fir-tree,</b> which annoyed it very much. But when two more winters had passed the <b>fir-tree</b> was so tall that the hare had to run round it. 'Ah! to grow and grow, and become great and old! {{that is the only}} pleasure in life,' thought the tree. In the autumn the woodcutters used to come and hew some of the tallest trees; this happened every year, and the young <b>fir-tree</b> would shiver as the magnificent trees fell crashing and crackling to the ground, their branches hewn off, and the great trunks left bare, so that they were almost unrecognisable. But then they were laid on waggons and dragged out of the wood by horses. 'Where are they going? What will happen to them?' ...|$|E
60|$|In a big <b>fir-tree,</b> whose {{branches}} reached {{nearly to}} the ground, he saw a large gathering of the birds, who sat chattering and gossiping pleasantly together. So he flew down and joined them.|$|E
60|$|As he disappeared, {{the visionary}} man among the <b>fir-trees</b> advanced; passed in silence; crossed the rivulet at a bound; and {{vanished}} as {{the figure of}} the Captain had vanished before him.|$|R
60|$|She paused--reflected a little--and {{led the way}} off {{the high}} road, on the right, to the fine clump of <b>fir-trees</b> which {{commands}} the famous view {{in that part of}} the Heath.|$|R
60|$|His hands {{dropped to}} his side as he spoke, and he sauntered slowly down the slope on which he stood. Entering a small {{plantation}} of <b>fir-trees</b> {{at the foot of}} it, he disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|... 4. 'I will {{plant in}} the {{wilderness}} the cedar, the shittah-tree, and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will set in the desert the <b>fir-tree,</b> and the pine, and the box-tree together' (Isa 41:19).|$|E
6000|$|Then came two footmen in livery {{and carried}} the <b>fir-tree</b> to a large and {{beautiful}} room. There were pictures hanging on the walls, and near the Dutch stove stood great Chinese vases with lions on their lids; there were armchairs, silk-covered sofas, big tables laden with picture-books and toys, worth hundreds of pounds-at least, so the children said. The <b>fir-tree</b> {{was placed in a}} great tub filled with sand, but no one could see that it was a tub, for it was all hung with greenery and stood on a gay carpet. How the tree trembled! What was coming now? On its branches they hung little nets cut out of coloured paper, each full of sugarplums; gilt apples and nuts hung down as if they were growing, over a hundred red, blue, and white tapers were fastened among the branches. Dolls as life-like as human beings--the <b>fir-tree</b> had never seen any before were suspended among the green, and right up at the top was fixed a gold tinsel star; it was gorgeous, quite unusually gorgeous! ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was once}} a pretty little <b>fir-tree</b> in a wood. It was in a capital position, for it could get sun, and there was enough air, and all around grew many tall companions, both pines and firs. It did not heed the warm sun and the fresh air, or notice the little peasant {{children}} who ran about chattering {{when they came out}} to gather wild strawberries and raspberries. Often they found a whole basketful and strung strawberries on a straw; they would sit down by the little <b>fir-tree</b> and say, 'What a pretty little one this is!' The tree did not like that at all.|$|E
6000|$|After some pressing, the {{following}} reply was extracted:--"It is so shut in with <b>fir-trees,</b> but I suppose {{you want them}} to hide the town, and there is nothing to see if they were away." ...|$|R
60|$|On a nearer {{view the}} garden {{proved to be}} small and poor and ill kept. I left it behind me, opened a little gate in a ring fence, and found myself in a {{plantation}} of <b>fir-trees.</b>|$|R
60|$|Edgar sighed; and, {{walking to}} the window, looked out towards Gimmerton Kirk. It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, and we could just {{distinguish}} the two <b>fir-trees</b> in the yard, and the sparely-scattered gravestones.|$|R
60|$|Then {{through the}} wet cobwebs, that hung like movable {{diaphragms}} on each blade and bough, {{he pushed his}} {{way down to the}} furrow which led from the secluded <b>fir-tree</b> island to the wide world beyond the field.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Henny Penny!' cried some; 'Humpty Dumpty!' cried others; {{there was}} a perfect babel of voices! Only the <b>fir-tree</b> kept silent, and thought, 'Am I {{not to be in}} it? Am I to {{have nothing to do with}} it?' ...|$|E
60|$|Whether {{that was}} the kind of palm that gives the oil, or was a sort only {{suitable}} to be the dream of a lonely <b>fir-tree</b> in the North on a cold height, I am in doubt to this day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, much larger. It is an oil-painting. You {{will look}} like a tall Hamadryad, dark and strong and noble, just issued {{from one of the}} <b>fir-trees,</b> when the stems are casting their {{afternoon}} shadows on the grass." ...|$|R
60|$|I fought them hard. I {{sought to}} shut that image out. But it abode to mock me. And then faintly from the valley, borne upon the breeze that came sighing through the <b>fir-trees,</b> rose the tinkle of an Angelus bell.|$|R
60|$|When {{she came}} to her own lane she paused, folding {{her hands on the}} top of the {{whitewashed}} gate, while she basked for a moment in the warmth that seemed cupped in the little grassy hollow hedged about with young <b>fir-trees.</b>|$|R
