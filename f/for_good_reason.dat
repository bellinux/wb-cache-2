25|$|Post-financial {{crisis and}} several {{spectacular}} fund governance failures, {{there has been}} much debate among fund directors worldwide about whether the proprietorship or professional firm approach is best for a professional fund. The matter has also been studied extensively by leading independent academic researchers at the Stanford Law Review, University of Kentucky and University of Cambridge among many others. Collectively these independent studies shattered many of the myths about professional fund governance and consistently supported the professional firm model over the proprietor model. Currently there is no independent research that supports the proprietorship model. In the Stanford Law Review, the authors argue “we know of no other service provided for corporations that is obligated by law to be performed by a sole proprietorship, and <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason.</b> Lawyers, consultants, accountants, doctors, and so on, all associate with each other to form corporate entities to provide their services for a host of well understood reasons".|$|E

[...] In contrast, Tor Books' Keith DeCandido wrote that while the guest stars were excellent, Tasha Yar's return for a [...] "TV death" [...] is the episode's major flaw: [...] "It is, in short, a scripted death, {{and you can see the}} marionette strings", he wrote. Film critic Jordan Hoffman wrote that the episode is [...] "heavy, PhilipK.

Tolmach, {{now president of}} Columbia Pictures and Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said they looked for a director who could give sharp focus to Parker's life. Webb said he [...] "was a little sceptical at first—you feel the presence of those other movies. But then I was like, 'How could I walk away from this? What an opportunity!'" [...] Webb said in the press release announcing him that, [...] "Sam Raimi's virtuoso rendering of Spider-Man is a humbling precedent to follow and build upon. The first three films are beloved <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason.</b> But I think the Spider-Man mythology transcends not only generations but directors as well. I am signing on not to 'take over' from Sam. That would be impossible. Not to mention arrogant. I'm here because there's an opportunity for ideas, stories, and histories that will add a new dimension, canvas, and creative voice to Spider-Man." [...] Webb felt Spider-Man {{is different from the}} Harry Potter franchise, which is based on a few novels and [...] "more like James Bond" [...] because [...] "there's so much material in Spider-Man {{that there are so many}} stories to tell and so many characters." [...] He described the film as [...] "not a remake" [...] explaining that [...] "we're not making Sam's movie again. It's a different universe and a different story with different characters." ...|$|E
500|$|The Kurt–Blaine storyline was {{met with}} general acclaim from critics. In her review for the episode, Katie Morgan of Billboard reacted {{positively}} to the interaction between Kurt and Blaine.

[...] In his review, Mark Perigard opined, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold {{the hell out of}} the moment. It’s long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt always seemed to be stuck in pure misery." [...] Robert Canning was more critical on the storyline. He highly criticized Darren Criss' performance as Blaine. In a detailed review regarding the storyline, Canning wrote, [...] "Kurt finally got the first kiss he deserved. Too bad it came from the wooden, glass-eyed Blaine. Chris Colfer has been in the running for performance awards <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason.</b> Darren Criss will not be. Colfer and his character deserve better than the cardboard, unemotional declaration of love that Criss delivered. Yay for Kurt and his first boyfriend, but that was a bland work up to their kiss." [...] Sandra Gonzalez called the whole development [...] "simply perfect". Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet", and stated that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. James Poniewozik reacted positively to the storyline. In his review, Poniewozik wrote, [...] "As for the at-long-last kiss, it's to Glees credit that it made me think, ‘Finally, Blaine and Kurt are locking lips already!’ before it made me think, ‘Look, an honest-to-God gay kiss, between two men, on my primetime TV show!’" [...] Aly Semigran of MTV praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, saying that the kiss scene was a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment". Semigran went on to praise the acting in the scene, saying that both actors [...] "handled it with dignity and honesty". Brett Berk deemed the interaction to be [...] "appropriately fervid".|$|E

2500|$|About.com {{gave the}} show {{a rating of}} 4.5 stars. The series {{described}} Arthurs assets: The Arthur series has won several awards including the George Foster Peabody, and <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason.</b> Arthur presents issues and situations kids can relate to, and teaches positive behaviors and responses to these issues in a genuine and comical way. The series is fun and engaging to the target age group. Kids will relate to the storylines and characters, and will therefore give thought to the responses the characters demonstrate and outcome of those responses. Because [...] "Arthur" [...] presents real childhood issues, the show contains some imitative behavior such as name calling or bickering, much like children experience in their own lives. Kids might hear words like [...] "sissy" [...] or [...] "stupid" [...] and see Arthur and D.W. argue. Should children mimic some of these phrases or tactics, the show provides a good springboard for parents {{to talk about the}} issues with their children and point out the importance of considering others' feelings. The review continued by citing many ways in which children could extract more from the series, for example by encouraging kids to write stories based on their own families (in much the same way Arthur was first realised) or by Kim Brown, Marc Brown's sister, teaching kids to draw Arthur while on tour.|$|E

That image is very varied, [...] "but rarely <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason.</b> ... It is not strange that the tribulations of his marriage and family life and the references to his personality and personal customs, inviting easy caricature and circulation of an unflattering, if not comic, tradition." [...] The king is popularly shown as indolent, silly and clumsy, subjugated by a shrewish wife, a disgusting glutton who always had baked chicken in his coat pockets to eat them at any time with greasy hands, a version typified by the Brazilian film Carlota Joaquina – Princesa do Brasil (1995), a parody mixed with sharp social criticism. That work had enormous repercussions, but, according to the critical commentary of Ronaldo Vainfas, [...] "it is a story full of errors of all types, misrepresentations, imprecisions, inventions"; for historian Luiz Carlos Villalta, [...] "it constitutes a broad attack on historical knowledge", in contrast to director Carla Camurati's stated intent [...] "to produce a cinematic narrative that would constitute a type of historical novel with pedagogic function and, at the same time, would offer the viewer knowledge of the past and would help, as a people, to think about the present. It does not offer new historical knowledge to the viewer, even if one were to treat history as a novel: it reinforces, in truth, the ideas that the viewers bring, being zero in terms of increased knowledge...

2500|$|In a Consistory {{held for}} the {{promotion}} of cardinals on 25 May 1331, Pope John XXII appointed one and only one cardinal, Hélie de Talleyrand, as a Cardinal-Priest. This was at the request of King Philip VI of France, on the recommendation of Étienne de Mornay, Maître des Comptes and former Chancellor. The appointment caused a good deal of friction between the King and the Pope. Philip had asked for two cardinals, which the Pope was quite unwilling to grant. [...] Though he did elevate Talleyrand, Pope John sent off a tart letter to the King on 25 May, the day after he had approved the promotion. He pointed out that the College of Cardinals was already well supplied with the talents required by the Church. [...] Moreover, the Papacy had not been deaf to the requests of the French kings. [...] Of the twenty current cardinals, thirteen were subjects of the King of France. [...] Nonetheless, with the consent of those cardinals (or perhaps one should say 'pressure from'), he had agreed to promote Bishop Talleyrand. The Pope's complaints seem to have fallen on deaf ears, for the royal family were again begging for more cardinals in September. [...] This time, on 26 September, the Pope wrote to [...] Queen Joanna. He reminded the Queen of the rules observed in the Roman Curia. [...] Appointments were never made in private, only in open Consistory, with votes of the current cardinals heard; [...] appointments were made only <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason,</b> when the number of cardinals had fallen too low, or when there was an insufficiency in talent in theology or Canon Law, neither of which was the case at the present moment. [...] In fact the number of cardinals was excessively high, and there was talent aplenty. [...] She should also consider that there were now sixteen cardinals of French extraction, and only six Italians. He therefore refused the royal request. [...] The pressure continued, however, and on 20 December 1331 yet another French cardinal, Pierre Bertrand, was appointed.|$|E
2500|$|Jones was {{a logical}} choice for Fisk President. Jones, who {{for seven years}} worked as a {{professor}} of sociology at Hampton Institute, and after a brief stint as a statistician at the Bureau of the Census, joined the newly created Phelps-Stokes Fund in 1912 as its educational director, a position he would hold for over three decades. [...] Despite his unique qualifications for the position, Jones quickly turned down the opportunity, feeling he could do more for Black education in his role with the Phelps-Stokes Fund than he could at a single institution. With Jones no longer interested, responsibility for finding a suitable candidate fell largely to Booker T. Washington, and <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason.</b> Any serious candidate for the position required the blessing of Washington, Fisk's Board of Trustees and the General Education Board. In March 1914, after a long search, John Cutler Shedd, a professor of physics at Olivet College in Michigan, emerged as the leading candidate for the position. Shedd travelled to New York City to meet with a variety of Fisk stakeholders, including the Carnegie Foundation, officers of the American Missionary Association, academics from Cornell University (all of whom were friends with Booker T. Washington), and Wallace Buttrick. Shortly thereafter, Shedd and his wife visited Fisk's campus, and then proceeded [...] to Tuskegee to meet with Washington. Washington believed Shedd was [...] "the best man we can get for the presidency of Fisk University," [...] but warned of opposition by Fisk alumni and the Nashville Black community who wanted a Black president. He also predicted and a stormy period of two or three years for Shedd and his family to acclimate to the unique conditions of the South.
