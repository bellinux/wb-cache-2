60|$|LORD W. I {{should like}} to do {{something}} <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> if you'll allow me.|$|E
60|$|Sir ANTHONY Are you my son or not?--answer <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> you dog, if you won't for me.|$|E
6000|$|Her anxious {{emphasis}} started them off, as she {{had learned}} to call it; this was the echo she infallibly and now quite resignedly produced; moreover Sir Claude's laughter was an indistinguishable part of the sweetness of his being there. [...] "We've been married, my dear child, three months, and my interest in you is a consequence, don't you know? of my great affection <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> In coming here it's of course <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> I'm acting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly, my dear unsuspicious dove. There! I see you are impatient. You {{will know}} the truth soon enough. One kiss, <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, I {{never should}} have thought of him, if it hadn't been <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> talk that morning coming back from San Lazzaro." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are only}} half English; and <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> sake {{you should be}} proud and glad {{to fight for the}} North," [...] cried Belle warmly.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is very true. If {{you have}} any {{commission}} or message <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> Mr. Monday, I shall have great satisfaction in attending to your wishes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we'll spare her <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{a little}} while," [...] said Mr. Poyser. [...] "But we wonna spare her for anybody else, on'y her husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is no matter," [...] I whispered; [...] "I do {{not care}} <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother!</b> Her words are nothing! I will not leave you--not till you tell me everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis but {{a little}} golden ring, [...] I give it to thee with pride, [...] Wear it <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> sake [...] When {{you are on the}} tide." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're mistaken," [...] {{returned}} Norris, hardly {{knowing how}} to reply. [...] "But it's only natural that you should stick up <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> boarders. They help support the family, I suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Barrington {{smiled a}} little, {{but the man}} fancied there was a just {{perceptible}} tightening of the hand upon his arm. [...] "I would like to be, <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> sake," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Your duty {{requires}} you to win it back <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> But the task {{is a very difficult}} one, and full of peril, Jack. Have you courage to undertake it?' ...|$|E
60|$|If it is {{not good}} <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> and my mother so to die, then {{it is not}} good for this woman, whosoever's mother she might be, so to die.|$|E
60|$|THE BAWD: Leave {{the gentleman}} alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> take the strap {{to you at}} the bedpost, hussy like you.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's another thing. You can't get a post in England, and <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> and sister's sakes, {{had better}} leave the country. A fast New York boat sails from Liverpool to-morrow. You must get off by to-night's train." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{well that}} you should. Under these circumstances, if I had the power, I would {{put in a}} curate, and pay over the extra {{proceeds}} of the living <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> maintenance. But I have no such power." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have paid}} the penalty!' he said sadly. 'Men of my sort always get {{the worst of}} it somehow. Though I never did <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> any harm. Now, Avice--I'll call you dear Avice <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> sake and not <b>for</b> <b>your</b> own--I must see what I can do to help you out of the {{difficulty}} that unquestionably you are in. Why can't you love your husband now you have married him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I don't want to {{be taken}} to Edinburgh and hanged. Besides, after hearing of your {{temporary}} settlement with Black, I thought the safest place <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> would be beside yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not go, Edith," [...] {{said the}} old man. [...] "Peregrine, put a chair <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> I have told him that all this is over now between me and Lady Mason." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] said Mr. Holiday, [...] "perhaps I could; but {{it might}} be too {{fatiguing}} <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> She has not been accustomed to ride on horseback much of late years.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can only}} do our best, lad, and <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> sake we'll pray that both of us may go back to Benedict; but if only one, then it should be you, who have promise of so many more years of life than I." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Welcome, fair Junkern!" [...] said Master Gottfried; [...] "welcome both <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> {{sake and}} <b>your</b> own! These thy sons, my little one?" [...] he added, smiling. [...] "Art sure I neither dream nor see double! Come to the gallery, {{and let me}} see thee better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, then!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Bowen. [...] "We {{need not}} wait <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> answer. Mr. Morton ought to know, and {{he ought to}} know at once. Don't try to blind yourself, Imogene, to what you see as plainly as I do. He {{is in love with}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{only chance}} that I see, then, of your {{reviving}} {{your sense of}} responsibility to--to those various sacred things you have forgotten, is in sending <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> to join you here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{and that}} is why I take the liberty of {{speaking}} to you. I hope that the great friendship which I feel <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> will be allowed to stand as my excuse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 2. As an {{earthquake}} rocks a corse In its coffin in the clay, So White Winter, that rough nurse, Rocks the death-cold Year to-day; [...] 10 Solemn Hours! wail aloud <b>For</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> in her shroud.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you must}} subdue that {{imperious}} nature of yours <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> sake if not <b>for</b> <b>your</b> own. Besides, {{you have been}} very wicked and reckless and daring, just like a Douglas. You ought to do penance with a good grace. I may conclude, since you are here, that Elinor McQuinch's story is true {{as far as the}} facts go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{she was a}} {{treasure}} to me!" [...] Madam resumes. [...] "I never should have nursed my boys through their illnesses but <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> admirable care of them. Colonel Lee, permit me to present you to my daughter, my Lady Warrington. Her ladyship is a neighbour of your relatives the Bunburys at home. Here comes his Excellency. Welcome, my lord!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so, Master Trench," [...] rejoined Paul. [...] "Hutchins' {{real name}} was Tyndale, and he had resumed the name before Lucy Wentworth {{went to live with}} the family. So, you see, Olly, you are indebted, in a {{roundabout}} way, as I said, to the Tyndales <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> letter. William will make his mark pretty deeply on the generation, I think, if God spares him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is just; and I shall {{act on the}} suggestion," [...] {{observed}} my father. [...] "You have a {{right to}} demand this of us, Mordaunt, and I can promise <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> as well as myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; it is <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{to prevent}} it. Only think of it, Mason. He is over seventy, and, {{as he says}} himself, he will not burden the estate with a new jointure. Why should she do it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{that must}} be very amusing," [...] said Mr. Holiday; [...] "but {{it would not be}} so {{comfortable}} <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> to mount up there. Besides, I have engaged our places already in the coup√©, and paid for them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stephan Olson [...] - [...] How I Met <b>Your</b> <b>Mother</b> (<b>for</b> [...] "How <b>Your</b> <b>Mother</b> Met Me") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, then I should baulk your dream, {{which is}} either true or false. If true, I have no choice, {{it must be}} fulfilled; if false, why should I heed it? Cicely, I am a plain man and take no note of such fancies. Yet I have enemies, and it may well chance that my day is done. If so, use <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> wit, girl; beware of Maldon, look to yourself, and as <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> jewels, hide them," [...] {{and he turned to}} go.|$|R
6000|$|... "How can {{you look}} that--that dear lady, and a Christian clergyman in the face, sir?" [...] bounced out the Doctor, {{in spite of}} Helen's pale, {{appealing}} looks. [...] "Where has he been? Where his mother's son should have been ashamed to go. <b>For</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> an angel, sir, an angel. How dare you bring pollution into her house, and make that spotless creature wretched with the thoughts of your crime?" ...|$|R
