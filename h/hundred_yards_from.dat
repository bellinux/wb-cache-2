5|$|Protesters {{began to}} gather outside Tottenham police station, a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> Broadwater Farm, around 1:30am on Sunday morning, 6 October. Four of the station's windows were smashed, but the Jarrett family asked {{the crowd to}} disperse. Later that day, two police {{officers}} were attacked with bricks and paving stones at the Farm, and a police inspector was attacked in his car.|$|E

He was quickly freed from the {{aircraft}} by his men, but died in an ambulance minutes later; his orders to return home were found in his jacket pocket. Baker was buried in a small military cemetery near Toul; in 1921, his mother had his remains moved to her family plot in West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|At 05:30 on 22 May, the Anglo-Egyptian advance continued, but {{the nature}} of the country, which {{consisted}} mainly of rolling low level sand-hills, with plenty of concealed ground and scattered bushes, reduced visibility down to just a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards.</b> <b>From</b> the start, large groups of Fur camaliers and cavalry were observed. So instead of sending out his scouts Kelly formed an advance guard of the mounted infantry, a camel company and four Maxim machine guns. At 10:30, the Fur troops were observed in a strong entrenched position around the village of Beringia.|$|E

5|$|Lurgan Park, a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> {{the main}} street, {{is the largest}} urban park in Northern Ireland and the second-largest in Ireland after Phoenix Park, Dublin. It used {{to be part of}} the estate of Brownlow House, a 19th-century Elizabethan-style manor house. In 1893, the land was {{purchased}} by Lurgan Borough Council and opened as a public park in 1909 by Earl Aberdeen, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It includes a sizeable artificial lake and an original Coalbrookdale fountain. Today the park is home to annual summer events such as the Lurgan Agricultural Show, and the Lurgan Park Rally, noted as the largest annual motor sport event in Northern Ireland and a stage in the Circuit of Ireland rally.|$|E
5|$|Trollope {{established}} himself at The Shannon Hotel, a long bow-fronted Georgian building, which was over 100 {{years old at}} that time. The hotel, which still exists, {{is located at the}} bottom of the town, a mere one <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> the river. The post office where Trollope worked was at the top of the town, which is only a matter of minutes on foot. Next to the post office was a two-roomed bungalow which was used by the Postal Surveyor and his new deputy as their working headquarters. This building is often erroneously considered to have been the residence of Trollope himself.|$|E
5|$|During the Williamite Wars of 1690–1691, the {{garrison}} espoused {{the cause of}} James II in contrast with that of Birr, which took the side of William. A stone bridge across the Shannon was erected in 1685, and a Williamite army advancing from Birr in 1690 attempted to break it down but abandoned the attempt as too risky in consequence {{of the presence of}} Sarsfield's Army on the Connacht side. A broken arch of this bridge is still to be seen on that side a few yards below the present bridge of seven arches, which was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The square tower on the lower side of the bridge at the Galway end was erected to protect the old bridge, as was the Salt Battery, with emplacements for four cannons facing west and north, a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> town along the Crank Road.|$|E

5|$|Several {{witnesses}} reported men collecting for charity. On 20 April, four <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> apartment 5A, a bedraggled-looking {{man asked}} a tourist in her holiday apartment for money for an orphanage in nearby Espiche. She {{described him as}} pushy and intimidating, and said he made her feel uncomfortable. Apparently there were no orphanages or similar institutions in or near Espiche at that time. On the afternoon of 25 or 26 April, the tourist who rented apartment 5A before the McCanns encountered a man on his balcony who had entered via the steps from the street. Polite and clean-shaven, the visitor asked for money for an orphanage. On {{the day of the}} disappearance, 3 May, there were four charity collections by two men in the streets around 5A. At 4 pm two black-haired men approached a British homeowner looking for funds for a hostel or hospice in or near Espiche, and at 5 pm two men approached another British tourist with a similar story.|$|E
5|$|The column {{had yet to}} {{run into}} any American troops when they reached Howard's Tavern (also known as Howard's Half-Way House), just a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> the Jamaica Pass. Tavern keeper William Howard and his son William Jr. were forced to act as guides to show the British {{the way to the}} Rockaway Foot Path, an old Indian trail that skirted the Jamaica Pass to the west (located today in the Cemetery of the Evergreens). Five minutes after leaving the tavern, the five American militia {{officers}} stationed at the pass were captured without a shot fired, as they thought that the British were Americans. Clinton interrogated the men and they informed him that they were the only troops guarding the pass. By dawn, the British were through the pass and stopped so that the troops could rest. At 09:00, they fired two heavy cannons to signal the Hessian troops below Battle Pass to begin their frontal assault against Sullivan's men deployed on the two hills flanking the pass, while Clinton's troops simultaneously flanked the American positions from the east.|$|E
5|$|Sir Tom Farmer {{took control}} of Hibs in 1991, but the club was still faced {{with the need to}} develop a stadium that would meet the {{requirements}} of the Taylor Report. Hibs entered talks with Edinburgh District Council about sharing a new stadium with Hearts, but the proposed site of Ingliston was in the wrong part of the city for Hibs. The club was more interested in the possibility of playing at Meadowbank Stadium, only a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> Easter Road, but there were planning difficulties with adapting Meadowbank into a large football stadium. The reorganisation of the club after Farmer took control meant that there was no real pressure to move, as he also owned Easter Road. The Hibs board made an assessment, however, that the ground could not be renovated in a cost-effective fashion before the August 1994 deadline set by the Taylor Report. Hibs proposed in January 1992 to sell Easter Road and move to a site owned by Farmer in Straiton. Hibs also invited Hearts to share this stadium, as their proposal for a site in Millerhill had been rejected by planners. Those plans were scaled down in 1993 when Lothian Regional Council refused to allow the rest of the Straiton site to be used for commercial development. The Hibs board continued to back the Straiton proposal and they insisted the installation of bucket seats in the uncovered South Terrace was merely to comply with the Taylor Report deadline. This measure also reduced the capacity of Easter Road to 13,500.|$|E

5|$|The 8th Division {{was sent}} to France in November 1914; {{immediately}} after arrival, two battalions were deployed to hold {{a section of the}} front line for a week during the closing stages of the First Battle of Ypres. However, the brigade did not see its first major action under Pinney's command until 10 March 1915, when it was committed to action as part of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. The 23rd Brigade met heavy resistance when it began its attack, due to a failure by the divisional artillery to bombard a large section of the defenders' trenches; the 2nd Middlesex, making a frontal attack, were wiped out almost completely. The other lead battalion of the brigade, the 2nd Cameronians, was enfiladed from the undamaged sector and took heavy losses, losing almost all its officers and retreating in confusion. Pinney quickly learned of this—he was only two <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> the front line—and decided to continue the attack. As {{he was not able to}} call for artillery support, the only possible approach was to send in the two reserve battalions. The second assault suffered heavy casualties at the outset, and quickly had to be called off when it was discovered that the corps artillery was about to fire on the positions being attacked; the Devonshires and West Yorkshires were withdrawn, having taken high casualties and achieved little. After this, the attack continued to bog down, and whilst there was some success elsewhere in the divisional sector, nothing more was achieved by 23rd Brigade. Following Neuve Chapelle, the brigade was reinforced with two Territorial battalions. At the Battle of Aubers on 9 May, 23rd Brigade was held in reserve by 8th Division and so escaped the heavy casualties of the two attacking brigades. Around noon a scratch force of all available infantry was pushed forward by the divisional commander to support these two brigades, including some units of Pinney's brigade.|$|E
25|$|Boston's Hyatt Harborside Hotel, {{which sits}} {{only a few}} <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> the runway threshold, was built {{primarily}} to prevent Massport from ever extending the length of 14/32 or using it for takeoffs or landings over the city.

The 26th convoy for Seneca, OM-99 (OutboundMilford Haven), consisted of 21 ships bound for Gibraltar. On 16 September at 11:30 hours the steamship Wellington, a ship in convoy OM-99, was torpedoed and Seneca proceeded at full speed to her assistance. At 11:31 a submarine was sighted a few <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> Wellington. Senecas crew fired three shots at the submarine before it submerged.

25|$|When {{the bell}} rang, Seabiscuit broke in front, led by over a length after 20 seconds, and soon crossed {{over to the}} rail position. Halfway down the backstretch, War Admiral started to cut into the lead, {{gradually}} pulling level with Seabiscuit, then slightly ahead. Following advice he had received from Pollard, Woolf had eased up on Seabiscuit, allowing his horse to see his rival, then asked for more effort. Two <b>hundred</b> <b>yards</b> <b>from</b> the wire, Seabiscuit pulled away again and continued to extend his lead over the closing stretch, finally winning by four lengths despite War Admiral's running his best time for the distance.|$|E
