5|$|Unlike {{almost all}} other dinosaur groups, skulls {{are the most}} {{commonly}} preserved elements of ceratopsian skeletons and many species are known only from skulls. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of variation between and even within ceratopsian species. Complete growth series from embryo to adult are known for Psittacosaurus and Protoceratops, allowing the study of ontogenetic variation in these species. Significant sexual dimorphism has been noted in Protoceratops and several ceratopsids.|$|E
5|$|The order Rodentia may {{be divided}} into suborders, infraorders, superfamilies and families. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of {{parallelism}} and convergence among rodents caused {{by the fact that}} they have tended to evolve to fill largely similar niches. This parallel evolution includes not only the structure of the teeth, but also the infraorbital region of the skull (below the eye socket) and makes classification difficult as similar traits may not be due to common ancestry. Brandt (1855) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders, Sciuromorpha, Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha, based on the development of certain muscles in the jaw and this system was widely accepted. Schlosser (1884) performed a comprehensive review of rodent fossils, mainly using the cheek teeth, and found that they fitted into the classical system, but Tullborg (1899) proposed just two sub-orders, Sciurognathi and Hystricognathi. These were based on the degree of inflection of the lower jaw and were to be further subdivided into Sciuromorpha, Myomorpha, Hystricomorpha and Bathyergomorpha. Matthew (1910) created a phylogenetic tree of New World rodents but did not include the more problematic Old World species. Further attempts at classification continued without agreement, with some authors adopting the classical three suborder system and others Tullborg's two suborders.|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} of the root system, comprising a vertical tap root and multiple horizontal laterals, develops in the seedling's first year. Thereafter, the sinker and laterals continue to lengthen, and new laterals appear. There are only three to five laterals at first, but this number typically increases to eight to ten within ten years. During the first winter, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of root system development, especially elongation of the sinker root, but almost no shoot growth. By summer, the sinker root has generally almost reached the water table, and shoot growth increases substantially. Around February, the shoot forms a resting bud, and growth then ceases until October. On resumption of shoot growth, the shoots grow rapidly for a short time, while the plant is under little water stress; then, {{with the onset of}} water stress, the plants settles into a long period of slower shoot growth. This pattern of summer-only shoot growth is maintained throughout the life of the plant, except that in mature plants, seasonal shoot growth may cease with the formation of a terminal inflorescence rather than a resting bud. Inflorescence development continues after shoot growth ceases, and flowering commences in February or March. March and April are the peak months for flowering, which ends in July or August.|$|E

Exposure to ozone (and the pollutants that produce it) is linked to premature death, asthma, bronchitis, heart attack, and other cardiopulmonary problems.|$|E

25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of {{variation}} {{in the pattern of}} dairy production worldwide. Many countries which are large producers consume most of this internally, while others (in particular New Zealand), export a large percentage of their production. Internal consumption is often in the form of liquid milk, while the bulk of international trade is in processed dairy products such as milk powder.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes ectomycorrhizal {{plantation}} species, such as {{pine and}} eucalyptus, are planted and promoted {{for their ability}} to act as a sink for atmospheric carbon. However, the ectomycorrhizal fungi of these species also tend to deplete soil carbon over relatively short periods of time. Thus there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of mounting resistance to using tree plantations as general solutions to combatting rising carbon dioxide levels.|$|E

25|$|Within compounds, an epenthetic vowel {{is added}} to break up what would {{otherwise}} be unacceptable clusters of consonants. This vowel is most commonly the nominal affix -o, regardless of number or case, as in kant-o-birdo ('a songbird') (the root kant-, 'to sing', is inherently a verb), but other part-of-speech endings may be used when -o- is judged to be grammatically inappropriate, as in mult-e-kosta ('expensive'). There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of personal variation as to when an epenthetic vowel is used.|$|E
25|$|Square Dancing in the UK {{has seen}} {{diminishing}} numbers of dancers since the 1990s as the activity {{has failed to}} attract sufficient numbers of younger dancers. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of debate {{as to how to}} arrest this decline, or even if the decline should be addressed and accepted as inevitable. British dancers tend to be older people - this is in contrast to countries such as Denmark and Germany where there are flourishing numbers of teenage, student, and family dancers.|$|E

This diversity among immigrants {{can be seen in}} language use, as the majority of second-generation immigrants are bilingual, with 2/3 speaking a language other than English in their homes. In addition, differing ethnicity and racial groups have experiences that are unique to their group. Hispanics, Asian Americans, and African Americans are three of the major groups that make up the population of second-generation immigrants in the United States.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of {{research}} into the use of miR-122 as a biomarker for hepatitis C. While some studies dispute its efficacy for diagnosing Hep C, other research indicates {{that it may be}} useful in diagnosing specific forms of hepatitis. For instance, decreased levels of miR-122 have been linked to a strain of hepatitis C that is resistant to interferon therapy. In this case, measuring miR-122 levels in the bloodstream of hepatitis C positive patients would enable more accurate and personalized therapy for their disease.|$|E
25|$|In addition, general {{relativity}} {{is inconsistent with}} quantum mechanics, the physical theory that describes the wave–particle duality of matter, and quantum mechanics does not currently describe gravitational attraction at relevant (microscopic) scales. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of speculation in the physics community as to the modifications that might be needed to both {{general relativity}} and quantum mechanics in order to unite them consistently. The speculative theory that unites general relativity and quantum mechanics is usually called quantum gravity, prominent examples of which include String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity.|$|E
