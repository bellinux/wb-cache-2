5|$|Even {{before the}} {{extensive}} clearing of the Wheatbelt in the 1930s, B.cuneata {{must have had}} a highly <b>fragmented</b> distribution, since the deep yellow sand favoured by the species occurs only in patches, and makes up only 10 to 15% of the area. Around 93% of the land has now been cleared of native vegetation, with the remaining 7% occurring in remnants of various sizes. Thus land clearing must have further <b>fragmented</b> an already <b>fragmented</b> population, as well as greatly reduced the number of individual plants.|$|E

5|$|Predators of {{treecreeper}} nests {{and young}} include the great spotted woodpecker, red squirrel, and small mustelids, and predation {{is about three}} times higher in <b>fragmented</b> landscapes than in solid blocks of woodland (32.4% against 12.0% in less <b>fragmented</b> woodlands). The predation rate increases {{with the amount of}} forest edge close to a nest site, and also the presence of nearby agricultural land, in both cases probably because of a higher degree of mustelid predation. This species is parasitised in the nest by the moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae. The juvenile survival rate of this species is unknown, but 47.7% of adults survive each year. The typical lifespan is two years, but the maximum recorded age is eightyears and tenmonths.|$|E

5|$|Banksia oligantha {{is listed}} as an {{endangered}} species under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and as rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950.

Threats include grazing by sheep and rabbits, drought, the drift of aerosol chemicals from surrounding farmland, invasion by weeds, and rising salinity. Studies have shown it to be moderately susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
