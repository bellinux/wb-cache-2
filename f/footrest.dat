25|$|A chair {{without a}} back or arm rests is a stool, or when raised up, a bar stool. A chair with arms is an armchair; one with upholstery, {{reclining}} action, and a fold-out <b>footrest</b> is a recliner. A permanently fixed chair in a train or theater is a seat or, in an airplane, airline seat; when riding, it is a saddle or bicycle saddle; {{and for an}} automobile, a car seat or infant car seat. With wheels it is a wheelchair; or when hung from above, a swing. An upholstered, padded chair for two people is a 'loveseat', while if it is {{for more than two}} person it is a couch, sofa, or settee; or if is not upholstered, a bench. A separate <b>footrest</b> for a chair, usually upholstered, is known as an ottoman, hassock, or pouffe.|$|E
25|$|A {{recliner}} is a reclining armchair. It has {{a backrest}} {{that can be}} tilted back, causing a <b>footrest</b> to extend from the front. Edward Knabusch and Edwin Shoemaker invented the first recliner in Monroe, Michigan in 1928 when they modified a wooden porch chair so that the seat moved forward as the back reclined. A padded model was later developed.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Honda only offered one model, {{designated}} as the Hawk, now simply designated CB400T. The CM400E took {{over the role of}} the cheaper Hawk I. It is similar to the European CB400NA. It has the same European styling and six-speed manual gearbox, although the pegs, <b>footrest</b> and gear lever are in the same position as the earlier Hawk variants. The bike became electric start only. Smaller 30mm Keihin CV carburettors with accelerator pumps were fitted to comply with US emissions controls. The 1981 model is similar to the European CB400NB and has a dual piston front brake caliper, plastic front fender and a different tank shape.|$|E

25|$|Fiesta Class {{seats are}} also {{available}} on all aircraft. <b>Footrests</b> and tray tables {{are found in the}} seat in front, except for bulkhead and exit seats, where the tray tables are embedded in the seats and <b>footrests</b> are on the floor. A319-100s and A320-200s have drop down overhead LCD screens. All aircraft in the mainline fleet feature audio entertainment to Fiesta Class passengers.|$|R

25|$|Returning to the TT {{after an}} absence 4years, the 1927 races held {{contrasting}} fortunes for Guthrie. Starting the Junior race with number 36 riding a New Hudson motorcycle, Guthrie retired on lap 5 at Ballacraine {{with a broken}} petrol pipe. This {{was followed by a}} fine second place, 8minutes and 17 seconds behind the winner Alec Bennett riding for the works Norton team in the Senior race, again on a New Hudson at number 18, despite being delayed at the TT Grandstand on lap 2 to tighten a loose <b>footrest.</b> Guthrie finished the race in 4hours, and 4minutes at an average race speed of 66.02mph.|$|E
25|$|In the Philippines, some Catholics are voluntarily, non-lethally crucified for {{a limited}} time on Good Friday to imitate the sufferings of Christ. Pre-sterilised nails are driven through the palm of the hand between the bones, {{while there is a}} <b>footrest</b> to which the feet are nailed. Rolando del Campo, a {{carpenter}} in Pampanga, vowed to be crucified every Good Friday for 15 years if God would carry his wife through a difficult childbirth, while in San Pedro Cutud, Ruben Enaje has been crucified 27 times. The Church in the Philippines has repeatedly voiced disapproval of crucifixions and self-flagellation, while the government has noted that it cannot deter devotees. The Department of Health insists that participants in the rites should have tetanus shots and that the nails used should be sterilized.|$|E

40|$|Rabbits in {{conventional}} farms {{are housed in}} wire net cages with mesh floors to separate them from droppings. In time, lacerations appear on the legs of adult rabbits causing ulcerative pododermatitis or sore hocks, a severe health and welfare problem. Pain causes behavioral changes; productivity is reduced and the most seriously affected animals die or are culled. In this study we evaluated the attention producers have given to this problem and its prevention by installing <b>footrests</b> in cages. We made 2, 331 visits to 664 commercial farms in Spain and Portugal between 2001 and 2012, and evaluated morbidity by examining 105, 009 females and 10, 722 males. The study highlights {{that the rate of}} farms with <b>footrests</b> increased from 27. 8 % in 2001 to 75. 2 % in 2012. Prevalence of sore hocks in does in 2001 was 11. 4 %, decreasing to 6. 3 % in 2012; prevention of ulcerative pododermatitis was associated (P < 0. 001) with the presence of <b>footrests.</b> Overall, prevalence was 4. 87 ± 0. 26 on farms with <b>footrests</b> and 13. 71 ± 0. 32 without (P < 0. 01) ...|$|R

500|$|Most medieval women rode astride. [...] Although {{an early}} chair-like sidesaddle with handles and a <b>footrest</b> was {{available}} by the 13th century and allowed women of the nobility to ride while wearing elaborate gowns, they were not universally adopted during the Middle Ages. [...] This was {{largely due to the}} insecure seat they offered, which necessitated a smooth-gaited horse being led by another handler. The sidesaddle did not become practical for everyday riding until the 16th-century development of the pommel horn that allowed a woman to hook her leg around the saddle and hence use the reins to control her own horse. Even then, sidesaddle riding remained a precarious activity until the invention of the second, [...] "leaping horn" [...] in the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|In {{place of}} a {{built-in}} <b>footrest,</b> some chairs come with a matching ottoman. [...] An ottoman is a short stool that {{is intended to be}} used as a <b>footrest</b> but can sometimes be used as a stool. [...] If matched to a glider chair, the ottoman may be mounted on swing arms so that the ottoman rocks back and forth with the main glider.|$|E
2500|$|In {{all matters}} of holding and playing it is {{recommended}} that the player use only the muscles needed for any musical task and to relax as much as possible, using only as much force as is necessary. This will allow one to play longer, easier and to put the effort into creativity rather than mechanics. [...] In the past many players sat cross-legged on a rug, but now most perform sitting, often using a classical guitarist's <b>footrest</b> under the right foot to help hold the barbat.|$|E

2500|$|Business Premier is {{the highest}} {{available}} class on Air New Zealand flights, available on both 777 variants and the 787 aircraft. The seating is configured in a herringbone layout in a 1-2-1 configuration on the 777s and 1-1-1 on the 787, allowing direct access for every passenger to an aisle. Each seat is [...] wide leather and comes with an ottoman <b>footrest</b> {{that doubles as a}} visitor seat. The seat converts to a full length (...) lie-flat bed, for which a pillow, duvet and sheet are provided.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{aircraft}} {{commonly used}} tailwheels, many aircraft (like {{a number of}} First World War Sopwith aircraft, such as the Camel fighter) were equipped with steerable tailskids, which operate similar to a tailwheel. When the pilot pressed the right rudder pedal — or the right <b>footrest</b> of a [...] "rudder bar" [...] in World War I — the skid pivoted to the right, creating more drag {{on that side of}} the plane and causing it to turn to the right. While less effective than a steerable wheel, it gave the pilot some control of the direction the craft was moving while taxiing or beginning the takeoff run, before there was enough airflow over the rudder for it to become effective.|$|E
2500|$|The 170-ton statue is {{composed}} of 28blocks of white Georgia marble (Georgia Marble Company) and rises [...] from the floor, including the [...] seated figure (with armchair and <b>footrest)</b> upon an [...] high pedestal. The figure of Lincoln gazes directly ahead and slightly down {{with an expression of}} gravity and solemnity. His frock coat is unbuttoned, and a large United States flag is draped over the chair back and sides. French paid special attention to Lincoln's expressive hands, which rest on the enormous arms of a circular, ceremonial chair, the fronts of which bear fasces, emblems of authority from Roman antiquity. French used casts of his own fingers to achieve the correct placement.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{reference}} works contend the cross was [...] "a post with a cross-beam" [...] (Theological Dictionary of the New Testament), [...] "the form usually seen in pictures, the crux immissa (Latin cross †), ... {{in which the}} upright beam projects above the shorter crosspiece" [...] (International Standard Bible Encyclopedia); and [...] "most likely the crux immissa (the traditional † depiction) or the crux commissa (a T-shaped cross)" [...] (John R. Donahue and Daniel J. Harrington, The Gospel of Mark). Donahue and Harrington suggest: [...] "The victim was first affixed to the crossbeam (patibulum) with ropes and/or nails through the wrists or forearms. Then the crossbeam was fitted on the vertical beam and the victim was lifted up and set on a peg or [...] "seat" [...] on the vertical beam and perhaps also on a <b>footrest.</b> The idea was to prolong the agony, {{not to make the}} victim more comfortable." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like its B5 predecessor, visually, the B7 RS4 {{differs from}} its related B7 S4, by having even wider flared {{front and rear}} wheel arches (fenders), {{to allow for a}} wider axle track. [...] Over the B7 A4, it also {{includes}} two larger frontal side air intakes (for the two additional side-mounted coolant radiators). [...] The trim on the saloon and roof rails on the estate are chrome as standard but can also be found in black with the addition of the Optic Pack which includes a black front grill, all exterior trim and black roof rails on the estate version. [...] The B7 RS4 also includes an optional adaptive headlights to complement the standard [...] "Xenon Plus" [...] (Bi-Xenon) High Intensity Discharge (HID) headlamps, which swivel around corners in conjunction with steering wheel movements. [...] Also standard are daytime running lights (DRLs), found within the main headlamp housings, identical to its related B7 A4 and S4, and use a conventional tungsten filament bulb. [...] An acoustic parking system with front and rear sensors is also a standard fitment. [...] Unique carbon fibre interior trims, along with a lap timer within the central Driver Information System (DIS), aluminium pedal caps and <b>footrest,</b> and RS 4 logos complete the look.|$|E
50|$|<b>Footrests</b> {{were placed}} too far forward for many riders {{and a common}} {{modification}} was to replace them with rearset <b>footrests.</b> Although not suitable for large riders, the 3½ was renowned for sharp and impeccable handling {{and was able to}} compete against larger capacity motorbikes on twisty roads. Maximum torque was above 6,000 rpm and so required high revving, similar to a two-stroke, {{to make the most of}} the engine's characteristics. Nevertheless, a 3½ Sport could still return 70 mpgimp when ridden hard. The 3½ Sport had a higher compression ratio than the softer-tuned Strada. The Sport featured Tomaselli clip-ons handlebars and throttle, a steering damper and Veglia instruments.|$|R
5000|$|Pews are {{generally}} {{made of wood}} and arranged in rows facing the altar in the nave of a church. Usually a pathway is left between pews in the center {{to allow for a}} procession; some have benchlike cushioned seating, and hassocks or <b>footrests,</b> although more traditional, conservative churches usually have neither cushions nor <b>footrests.</b> Many pews have slots behind each pew to hold Bibles, prayer books, hymnals or other church literature. Sometimes the church may also provide stations on certain rows that allow the hearing-impaired to use headsets in order to hear the sermon. In many churches pews are permanently attached to the floor, or to a wooden platform.|$|R
50|$|For 1983/4, it was envisaged, in {{line with}} the UK/Rest of World range, that the TSS-AV would also be fitted with the {{anti-vibration}} frame, rear-set <b>footrests,</b> a new seat-tail unit and TSX-style side panels all as standard.|$|R
