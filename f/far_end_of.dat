5|$|George A. Campbell and Zobel {{worked on}} this problem of extracting a single {{sideband}} from an amplitude-modulated composite wave for use in multiplexing telephone channels and the related problem of extracting (de-multiplexing) the signal at the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the transmission.|$|E
5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, or if the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. This can happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Transandinomys talamancae has a complex penis, with the distal (<b>far)</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the baculum (penis bone) ending in a structure consisting of three digits. As in most oryzomyines, the central digit {{is larger than the}} two at the sides. The outer surface of the penis is mostly covered by small spines, but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue.|$|E

50|$|The bridge {{withstood}} several restorations and reconstructions (60 BC, 32 BC, 23 BC, 5 AD, 69 AD, under Antoninus Pius {{and maybe}} under Emperors Trajan, Marcus Aurelius and Septimius Severus). On the imperial-age monetary depictions, the <b>far</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the bridge show arches with statues.|$|R
5|$|The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen (opening) {{perforates}} the distal (<b>far)</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the humerus (upper arm bone). The pelvis and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral tubercle of the acetabulum (part of the pelvis), which anchors the rectum femoris muscle, is reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosive}} {{charges in}} HMS Campbeltown detonated {{at noon on}} 28 March 1942, and the dry dock was destroyed. Reports vary {{on the fate of}} the two tankers that were in the dock; they were either swept away by the wall of water and sunk, or swept to the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the dock, but not sunk.|$|E
5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, there are twelve ribs. The first rib articulates {{with both the}} last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. Anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} a vertebra, are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal (<b>far)</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the humerus (upper arm bone).|$|E

5|$|Christchurch's {{town centre}} {{encompasses}} {{a mixture of}} traditional public houses, restaurants, coffee shops, antiquated cottages and historic listed buildings. The older part of the town dates from Saxon times and retains its Saxon street layout. The Grade II listed Mayor's Parlour was built as the market hall in 1745 at the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the High Street but was moved to its present position in 1849. It was enclosed and extended, and used as the town hall until the civic offices {{were built in the}} mid-1970s. It was restored to its former condition circa 1982 when the Saxon Square shopping precinct was built.|$|E
5|$|The Arch of Caracalla {{is one of}} Volubilis' most {{distinctive}} sights, situated {{at the end of}} the city's main street, the Decumanus Maximus. Although it is not architecturally outstanding, the triumphal arch forms a striking visual contrast with the smaller Tingis Gate at the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the decumanus. It was built in 217 by the city's governor, Marcus Aurelius Sebastenus, to honour the emperor Caracalla and his mother Julia Domna. Caracalla was himself a North African and had recently extended Roman citizenship to the inhabitants of Rome's provinces. However, by the time the arch was finished both Caracalla and Julia had been murdered by a usurper.|$|E
5|$|The French motto Quant Je Puis (As Much as I Can) {{is central}} to the ethos of the school, which focuses upon the all-round {{development}} of the individual. It is inherited from the Shireburn family who once owned the original mansion on the site; the family emblem is emblazoned, in stone, with the motto, above the fireplace in the Top Refectory. At the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the same room, once the dining room of the Shireburns, the motto can be seen again, carved into the minstrel's gallery: Quant Je Puis. Hugo Sherburn armig. me fieri fecit. Anno Domini 1523. Et sicut fuit sic fiat.|$|E

40|$|A compact {{model for}} RLC {{interconnect}} lines, {{in the form}} of a twopath hybrid ladder, is proposed for on-chip interconnect timing and noise analysis. The model parameters are synthesized through constrained nonlinear optimization to directly match the circuit response characteristics over a range of transition times and loads, both at the driving point and at the receiver <b>end.</b> The effect <b>of</b> capacitances on the return current distribution is explicitly considered in our work in obtaining the accurate responses for industrial circuits, and is found to have a significant effect. The parameters for this model are embedded in a table that is characterized once for a design and then used for the analysis of various structured interconnects. Compared with a prior compact modeling approach, our model is demonstrated to accurately predict responses such as the interconnect delay, gate delay, transition times at near and <b>far</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> switching lines as well as the overshoot at the <b>far</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> switching lines. 1...|$|R
5|$|The general concept pre-dated the Mk. IV and was {{essentially}} a UK version of the German Lorenz beam system. Lorenz, or Standard Beam Approach as it was known in the UK, used a single transmitter located off the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the active runway that was alternately connected {{to one of two}} slightly directional antennas using a motorized switch. The antennas were aimed so they sent their signals to the left and right of the runway, but their signals overlapped down the centreline. The switch spent 0.2seconds connected to the left antenna (as seen from the aircraft) and then 1second on the right.|$|E
5|$|The ulnar styloid process (a {{projection}} on the ulna, one of {{the bones}} of the forearm, where it meets the wrist) is not as hooked as in other lorisids, according to Schwartz, which Groves suggests may indicate that the wrist is more mobile. Another alleged diagnostic feature is the presence of an entepicondylar foramen (an opening near the distal, or <b>far,</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the bone) on the humerus (upper arm bone); however, Sarmiento found this feature in 4 out of 11 specimens, and on one side of a fifth, and Stump noted that the foramen occurred in specimens from across the potto's range.|$|E
5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, {{and to protect the}} tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once {{there is no longer a}} need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E

5|$|Flowers {{are usually}} borne {{in groups of}} three—one female flower {{together}} with two male flowers. In some species groups of four flowers (two male and two female) have been reported. At the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of male flowers replace the triads {{of male and female}} flowers. Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male flowers tend to fall into two groups—those with cream or yellow flowers and those with some amount of purple in the flowers. Female flowers are even less well known than male flowers.|$|E
5|$|From {{the same}} site where T.goodmani was found, Samonds also {{recorded}} the distal (<b>far)</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a Triaenops humerus (upper arm bone), with a width of 3.58mm. This bone was similar to humeri of T.menamena, {{but she did not}} identify it as either species because of the small size difference between T.menamena and T.goodmani. In site NCC-1 (estimated 69,600 to 86,800 years old), two Triaenops mandibles were recorded, one with p4 and m1 and another with m1–2 and part of m3. Relative to living Triaenops and Paratriaenops, m1 in those jaws is longer and narrower. Although sample sizes are small, the measurements do not resemble those of T.goodmani. In addition, the ridge between the entoconid and metaconid is stronger than in T.goodmani. Samonds identified these jaws only as Triaenops.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} of the {{entrance}} is the subway that links all the platforms, reached either by steps or lift; it houses the main public toilets, automated teller machines (ATM) and several catering outlets (there is catering on all platform islands except 13–15). A passenger information office and lounge are above the subway, the British Transport Police office and cycle racks are beyond, and at the western end is Platform 4, used by only a few trains. Alongside this is Platform 2, another bay platform but not signalled for passenger trains and used only for stabling empty trains, as is the former Motorail unloading bay alongside. At the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> this track is the old Fish Dock, occasionally used for stabling engineers' on-track equipment. Beyond the end of the platform the tracks swing to the right (the west) and pass out of sight beneath Bath Road Bridge, a girder bridge that carries the A4 out of the city.|$|E

5|$|Ranavalona I {{planted a}} pair of royal fig trees at the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Bevato {{compound}} and stood between them when addressing the public. These were later complemented by additional fig trees planted all around the courtyard by Ranavalona II and jacarandas planted by the French during the colonial period. The figs that shade the esplanade {{are believed to be}} imbued with hasina enhanced by the bones and skulls of sacrificed zebu and special marking stones that pilgrims from across Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and Comoros have come to place around them. Pilgrims gather in this courtyard to celebrate the Fandroana ceremony, during which time the sovereign historically engaged in a ritual bath to wash away the sins of the nation and restore order and harmony to society. Today, pilgrims celebrate by offering sacrifices or prayers to honor, appease or commune with their ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{along the}} lower Little Tennessee, lower Tellico, and lower Hiwassee rivers, the Overhill towns rose to {{prominence}} within the Cherokee Nation {{in the early}} 18th century, when they began to standardize trade with the British colonists. In {{the early part of}} the century, the Overhill towns' remote location at the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Trading Path meant they were reached only by those traders and explorers adventurous enough to make the difficult journey to the interior over the mountain range. By the middle of the century, the Overhill towns were consistently courted by both British and French emissaries, as the two powers struggled for the control of the continent and the lucrative fur trade.|$|E
5|$|The five division-size bridgeheads {{consolidated}} {{themselves on}} Monday, October 8 into two army-size bridgeheads: the Second Army with its three divisions occupied El-Qantarah {{in the north}} to Deversoir in the south, while the Third Army with two divisions occupied {{the southern end of}} the Bitter Lakes to a point southeast of Port Tawfiq (at the <b>far</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the canal). These two bridgeheads incorporated a total of 90,000 men and 980 tanks, dug in and entrenched. Each division deployed, in accordance with Operation Badr, two infantry brigades in its forward echelon, and one mechanized infantry brigade in the second echelon. In reserve was one armored brigade. The Egyptians had established anti-tank defences along their lines employing Sagger ATGMs, RPGs, B-10 and B-11 anti tank recoilless rifles.|$|E
