5|$|During ashfall events large {{demands are}} {{commonly}} placed on water resources for cleanup and shortages can result. Shortages compromise key {{services such as}} firefighting {{and can lead to}} a lack of water for hygiene, sanitation and drinking. Municipal authorities need to monitor and manage this water demand carefully, and may need to advise the public to utilise cleanup methods that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> water (e.g., cleaning with brooms rather than hoses).|$|E

5|$|In some Muslim countries, DST is {{temporarily}} abandoned during Ramadan (the {{month when}} no food should be eaten between sunrise and sunset), since the DST would delay the evening dinner.

Most Muslim countries <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> DST, partially for this reason.|$|E

It would also immediately begin purchasing 2% of its eggs from producers whose hens are not confined to small wire battery cages, and double that amount by the end of that year. It agreed with PETA that the company would issue a statement that it would be give purchasing preference to egg suppliers that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> battery cages and to those poultry suppliers that utilize or upgrade to controlled atmosphere killing, which is considered to be a more humane method of chicken and turkey slaughter.|$|E

5|$|Today all {{cardinals}} {{are required}} to be bishops, but priests named cardinal at an advanced age often petition the Pope for an exception to this rule. Bruno Heim says that since the cross is one heraldic emblem that only bishops {{have the right to}} bear, cardinals who are not bishops <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> it. Notable examples are Cardinals Albert Vanhoye and Avery Dulles; the latter's arms do display a cross.|$|E

These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E
5|$|Governments <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> {{the terms}} {{profit and loss}} to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either a surplus or a deficit.

A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E
