500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song are simple, written as an {{invitation}} to dance with the singer. Despite the simple lyrics, it carries sexual innuendos and undertones in the meaning. Similar to Madonna's previous single [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] (1984), a lyrical hook is also present in [...] "Into the Groove", directed at shy girls. The line [...] "At night I lock the door so no-one else can see" [...] implied that Madonna was not as brazen as her provocative image suggested. According to Barker, the nostalgic people would instantly recognize the song's lyrics at night clubs. He added that the line, [...] "Only when I'm dancing can <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> free," [...] expresses the freedom that a dance floor brings about, with the dancers happy to find freedom in the music. A neume is visible in the line [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me", which Barker believed, blurred the boundaries of reality and brought one closer {{to the world of}} fantasy.|$|E

The Williams FW07 proved to be very competitive, especially in the final part of the season, with FW07s winning {{all but two of}} the final six races of the 1979 calendar. The first win was for Regazzoni, at Silverstone, the first of over 100 victories for the Williams Grand Prix team. In deference to the team's Saudi sponsors, he celebrated on the podium with Lilt. However, despite his achievement, once again he was replaced by Carlos Reutemann {{at the end of the}} season.

Regazzoni replied, [...] "I love , and most of all I love to drive racing cars. So why should I stop when <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>this</b> way?".

He credits Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire's coach and former Australia international fast bowler, with helping him regain his confidence and felt that his problems had been exacerbated by over-coaching. In an interview in June 2014 Plunkett explained [...] "Different coaches told me different things and when you're a youngster you're like a sponge and {{take a lot of}} things in.... When I came to Yorkshire, Jason Gillespie just told me to run it and bowl quick. And when I did that I backed myself, bowled in my good areas and started picking up wickets." [...] Under the tutelage of Yorkshire coach and former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie, Plunkett's fortunes improved and he was awarded his county cap in 2013. The following year, Plunkett was recalled to the England Test team.|$|E
