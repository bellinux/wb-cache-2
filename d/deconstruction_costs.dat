40|$|Facing inexorable {{growth of}} global {{population}} and energy consumption, lignocellulosic biomass {{has taken a}} more central role in global energy strategy by providing sustainable sources for both liquid fuels and chemicals without competing with food and feed supplies. To establish a large scale, reliable, and economic lignocellulosic industry, biomass recalcitrance must be well understood and overcome. Currently cutting edge biological conversion research focuses mainly on three aspects: genetic modification of plant cell wall structure to reduce biomass recalcitrance, pretreatment of biomass as a critical prerequisite to achieve high sugar yields, and consolidated processing of enzymes and microorganisms to lower <b>deconstruction</b> <b>costs.</b> More importantly, however, synergistic concert of these three approaches is critical to develop practical solutions for this challenge. Thus, interactions and impacts among cell wall structural characteristics, pretreatment, and biological deconstruction are vital to understand. In light of this, six technical studies towards three main objectives were pursued in this thesis. First, an integrated chromatographic method for xylooligosaccharides determination and a high throughput system using dilute alkali conditions were developed as characterization tools to facilitate understanding how pretreatment affects cell wall polysaccharide deconstruction. Next, two fundamental studies on lignin deposition during pretreatment and reduced methylation of xylan side-chains, respectively, were employed to identify important recalcitrant aspects of lignin and hemicellulose on biomass digestion. Finally, systematic research was undertaken to develop Agave as a low recalcitrant, drought resistant biofuels feedstock for semi-arid lands. The findings of this thesis provide fundamental insights towards understanding interactions of lignin and hemicellulose, the two primary barriers to biological conversion, for more effective biomass deconstruction and better energy crops design...|$|E

At the same time these groups of wind towers can be a social-friendly solution if they solve challenging demands from the society such as integration in landscape, aesthetics, low noise nuisances… This paper presents part of a complete research project that was carried out between 2009 and 2015. First this article presents a new wind tower proposal that {{has been designed to}} reduce these social impacts as well as satisfying environmental aspects, economic requirements and boundary conditions such as height, turbine power, soil conditions. This proposal is composed of precast concrete modules joined with high-resistance steel bars that define a post-tension structure. These components define an attractive and transparent tripod that is transversally reinforced with steel profiles. This system holds the Spanish patent “Support structure to wind turbines, number ES 2 319 709 B 8 ” and aims to build 100 - 120 m high towers. At this height there is better wind quality and large turbines of 3 MW can be installed. Second, a sustainability assessment of this new hybrid wind tower has been carried out in order to evaluate its social, environmental and economic impacts compared to other solutions. Steel lattice structures, steel tubular systems, in situ concrete towers and precast concrete structures are the alternatives for wind farms that have been considered. MIVES, a MCDM methodology based on the value function concepts has been used to do this assessment, which has relied upon seminars of experts. This sustainability assessment enabled the identification of the aspects with the lowest sustainability index. These are the maintenance and <b>deconstruction</b> <b>costs</b> and for occupational hazards. Now these weak points can be corrected in the process of bringing the patented technology to market.

40|$|We {{define the}} <b>deconstruction</b> <b>cost</b> of a {{tripartite}} quantum state on systems $ABE$ as the minimum rate of noise needed {{to apply to}} the $AE$ systems, such that there is negligible disturbance to the marginal state on the $BE$ systems and the system $A$ of the resulting state is locally recoverable from the $E$ system alone. We refer to such actions as deconstruction operations and protocols implementing them as state deconstruction protocols. State deconstruction generalizes Landauer erasure of a single-party quantum state as well the erasure of correlations of a two-party quantum state. We find that the <b>deconstruction</b> <b>cost</b> of a tripartite quantum state on systems $ABE$ is equal to its conditional quantum mutual information (CQMI) $I(A;B|E) $, thus giving the CQMI an operational interpretation in terms of a state deconstruction protocol. We also define a related task called conditional erasure, in which the goal is to apply noise to systems $AE$ in order to decouple system $A$ from systems $BE$, while causing negligible disturbance to the marginal state of systems $BE$. We find that the optimal rate of noise for conditional erasure is also equal to the CQMI $I(A;B|E) $. State deconstruction and conditional erasure lead to operational interpretations of the quantum discord and squashed entanglement, which are quantum correlation measures based on the CQMI. We find that the quantum discord is equal to the cost of simulating einselection, the process by which a quantum system interacts with an environment, resulting in selective loss of information in the system. The squashed entanglement is equal to half the minimum rate of noise needed for deconstruction/conditional erasure if Alice has available the best possible system $E$ to help in the deconstruction/conditional erasure task.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a <b>deconstruction</b> of the <b>cost</b> and fair value models {{implicit}} in the Australian Accounting Standard (AASB 116), derived from the International Accounting Standard IAS 16. The paper examines the justification for the paradigm shift {{through the lens of}} the very framework that supports each accounting model. The analysis renders visible the contradictions embedded in the models, raising serious doubts about the ability of either model to provide financial information that is sufficiently relevant or reliable to be any more useful to potential users than the historical cost model that they have usurped. In this regard the standard fails to provide any benefits to warrant the paradigm shift...|$|R
30|$|For {{production}} of second generation cellulosic ethanol, polysaccharides present in lignocellulosic materials (such as agro and forestry residues, herbaceous grasses and woody plants), including cellulose and hemicellulose are {{of great interest}} as feedstocks. The technological outline developed for the {{production of}} fuel from lignocellulose involves the following steps. First, the cellulose and hemicellulose portions of the biomass must be broken down into sugars and a variety of pretreatments are required to carry out this saccharification step in an efficient and low-cost manner. Second, these sugars which are a complex mixture of 5 -carbon and 6 -carbon sugars must be fermented to make bioethanol. Low efficiency due to the natural recalcitrance of lignocellulose to <b>deconstruction</b> and high <b>cost</b> of enzymatic conversion, therefore, form the major bottlenecks in this technology. Significant research, therefore, have to be directed towards the identification of efficient cellulase systems and process conditions, besides those aimed at the biochemical and genetic improvement of existing organisms utilized in the process.|$|R
40|$|Production of {{renewable}} biofuels to displace fossil fuels currently {{consumed in the}} transportation sector is a pressing multiagency national priority (DOE/USDA/EERE). Currently, nearly all fuel ethanol is produced from corn-derived starch. Dedicated 'energy crops' and agricultural waste are preferred long-term solutions for renewable, cheap, and globally available biofuels as they avoid some of the market pressures and secondary greenhouse gas emission challenges currently facing corn ethanol. These sources of lignocellulosic biomass are converted to fermentable sugars {{using a variety of}} chemical and thermochemical pretreatments, which disrupt cellulose and lignin cross-links, allowing exogenously added recombinant microbial enzymes to more efficiently hydrolyze the cellulose for 'deconstruction' into glucose. This process is plagued with inefficiencies, primarily due to the recalcitrance of cellulosic biomass, mass transfer issues during deconstruction, and low activity of recombinant <b>deconstruction</b> enzymes. <b>Costs</b> are also high due to the requirement for enzymes and reagents, and energy-intensive cumbersome pretreatment steps. One potential solution to these problems is found in synthetic biology-engineered plants that self-produce a suite of cellulase enzymes. Deconstruction can then be integrated into a one-step process, thereby increasing efficiency (cellulose-cellulase mass-transfer rates) and reducing costs. The unique aspects of our approach are the rationally engineered enzymes which become Trojan horses during pretreatment conditions. During this study we rationally engineered Cazy enzymes and then integrated them into plant cells by multiple transformation techniques. The regenerated plants were assayed for first expression of these messages and then for the resulting proteins. The plants were then subjected to consolidated bioprocessing and characterized in detail. Our results and possible implications of this work on developing dedicated energy crops and their advantage in a consolidated bioprocessing system...|$|R
