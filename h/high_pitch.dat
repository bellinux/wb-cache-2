5|$|At the 8 August 1993 Fairchild air show, Holland {{once again}} {{commanded}} the B-52 demonstration flight. The demonstration profile once again included bank angles greater than 45°, low-altitude passes, and another <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> climbing maneuver, {{this time in}} excess of 80° nose high. The climb was so steep that fuel flowed out of the vent holes from the aircraft's wing tanks. The new wing commander, Brigadier General James M. Richards, and the new DO, Colonel William E. Pellerin, both witnessed the demonstration, but neither took any action.|$|E
5|$|During the 17 May 1992 Fairchild air show, Holland {{was again}} the command pilot of the B-52 aerial-demonstration flight. During the demonstration, Holland's {{aircraft}} again violated several safety regulations, including several low-altitude, steep turns {{in excess of}} 45° of bank and a <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> angle climb, estimated at over 60° nose high which Holland finished with a wingover maneuver. The new wing commander, Colonel Michael G. Ruotsala, apparently took no action. One week later, the new DO, Colonel Capotosti, on his own initiative warned Holland that if he violated any more safety regulations, Capotosti would ground him (remove him from flying status). Capotosti did not document his warning to Holland or take {{any other kind of}} formal action.|$|E

5|$|Cain {{started on}} Opening Day for the Giants in 2013. He pitched six shutout innings before being removed {{due to a}} <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> count; however, Kershaw threw a shutout, and the Dodgers beat the Giants 40. On April 7, Cain threw two no-hit innings before giving up nine runs {{in the third inning}} and getting removed from the game, {{becoming}} the first Giants to allow nine runs in an inning since Ernie Shore in 1912. The Cardinals beat the Giants 14–3. On August 23 against the Pirates, Cain was hit by Gaby Sánchez's line drive in the pitching arm, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list {{for the first time in}} his career. Cain would finish the season with a record of 8-10 in 30 starts. For the first time since 2006, Cain's ERA sat in the 4's, finishing with an exact 4.00 ERA.|$|E
5|$|The {{second is}} the {{circular}} bodied plucked lute, the yueqin. Percussion instruments include the daluo, xiaoluo, and naobo. The player of the gu and ban, a small <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> drum and clapper, is the conductor of the entire ensemble. The two main musical styles of Peking opera, Xipi and Erhuang, originally differed in subtle ways. In the Xipi style, the strings of the jinghu are tuned to the keys of A and D. The melodies in this style are very disjointed, possibly reflecting the style's derivation from the high and loud melodies of the Qinqiang opera of northwestern China. It is commonly used to tell joyous stories. In Erhuang, on the other hand, the strings are tuned to the keys of C and G. This reflects the low, soft, and despondent folk tunes of south-central Hubei province, the style's place of origin. As a result, it is used for lyrical stories. Both musical styles have a standard meter of two beats per bar. The two musical styles share six different tempos, including manban (a slow tempo), yuanban (a standard, medium-fast tempo), kuai sanyan ("leading beat"), daoban ("leading beat"), sanban ("rubato beat"), and yaoban ("shaking beat"). The xipi style also uses several unique tempos, including erliu ("two-six"), and kuaiban (a fast tempo). Of these tempos, yuanban, manban, and kuaiban are most commonly seen. The tempo {{at any given time}} is controlled by a percussion player who acts as director. Erhuang has been seen as more improvisational, and Xipi as more tranquil. The lack of defined standards among performance troupes and the passage of time may have made the two styles more similar to each other today.|$|E

25|$|Normal {{conversation}} is usually at middle or high pitch; low pitch {{occurs at the}} end of utterances other than yes–no questions, while <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> occurs {{at the end of}} yes–no questions. Very <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> is for strong emotion or emphasis. Pitch can indicate attitude: for example, Great uttered in isolation can indicate weak emotion (with pitch starting medium and dropping to low), enthusiasm (with pitch starting very high and ending low), or sarcasm (with pitch starting and remaining low).|$|E

25|$|The {{information}} question intonation is a rapid fall-off from <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> on {{the first}} word of a non-yes/no question, often followed by a small rise in pitch on the last syllable of the question.|$|E
5000|$|In non-tonal languages, like English, {{intonation}} encompasses lexical stress. A stressed syllable will typically be pronounced with a <b>higher</b> <b>pitch,</b> intensity, {{and length}} than unstressed syllables. For example, {{in the word}} intensity, the vowel represented by the letter [...] is stressed, so it is longer and pronounced with a <b>higher</b> <b>pitch</b> and intensity than the other vowels.|$|R

25|$|In Guinea, {{a typical}} {{ensemble}} uses three djembes and three dunun, called sangban (medium pitch), dundunba (bass pitch), and kenkeni (<b>high</b> <b>pitch,</b> also called kensedeni). If an ensemble {{includes more than}} one djembe, the highest pitched (and therefore loudest) djembe plays solo phrases and the other djembes and dunun play accompaniment.|$|E
25|$|Accent in Natchez {{is based}} on pitch rather than stress. Accent falls predictably on the {{penultimate}} syllable if it contains a long vowel, on the otherwise ante-penultimate. Accented short vowels are pronounced with <b>high</b> <b>pitch,</b> accented long vowels are pronounced with rising pitch, unaccented vowels have mid pitch, and certain forms such as imperatives and interrogatives have falling pitch.|$|E
50|$|The song of {{the male}} Pel's fishing owl is a deep, sonorous, horn-like boom, first a single and then a <b>higher</b> <b>pitched</b> huhuhu. The male also utters a ringed hoot, much <b>higher</b> <b>pitched</b> than those of most eagle-owls, {{followed}} by a deep, soft grunt: whoommmm-wot or hooomm-hut. The calls of the male are repeated ever 10 to 20 seconds can be heard from up to 3 km away. While singing, the male's throat and breast are often highly inflated. The female's songs are similar but are <b>higher</b> <b>pitched</b> and even in a double-note, i.e. hoot-oot. Females and young at the nest wail a shrill wheeoouu while anticipating food.|$|R

25|$|Welsh has {{a simple}} pitch accent {{but this does}} not affect meaning because it is always on the same syllable. It does however make it easier to {{differentiate}} words in rapid speech. The stress accent is normally on the last or penultimate syllable in Welsh, but the pitch accent is always placed on the last syllable of a word as a <b>high</b> <b>pitch.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stress helps {{predict the}} tones {{of all the}} vowels in a word: {{stressed}} vowels are high in pitch; all vowels following the stressed vowel are low in pitch; all short vowels preceding the stressed vowel are low in pitch; all long vowels preceding the stressed vowel are high in pitch; short vowels occurring between a long vowel and the accented vowel assimilate to a <b>high</b> <b>pitch.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sounds are {{transmitted}} via a receiver attached from {{the arm of}} the spectacles which are fitted firmly behind the boney portion of the skull {{at the back of the}} ear, (mastoid process) by means of pressure, applied on {{the arm of the}} spectacles. The sound is passed from the receiver on the arm of the spectacles to the inner ear (cochlea), via the bony portion. The process of transmitting the sound through the bone requires a great amount of power. Bone conduction aids generally have a poorer <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> response and are therefore best used for conductive hearing losses or where it is impractical to fit standard hearing aids.|$|E

25|$|The {{essential}} element of this automatic system is a lever arm attached to a mass in the centre-fuselage, which is connected with the pitch controls. The moment generated by the mass is arranged to reach an equilibrium condition with the pitch control forces at each flight condition, with the flaps moving to a high lift coefficient position at low speeds or {{when there is a}} <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> control load, and vice versa, maintaining the optimum angle of attack for the aerofoil. The automatic system on the Mü28 is identical in operation with the aircraft inverted, due to the use of a symmetrical section aerofoil set at zero degrees incidence, with the automatic system only turned off for takeoff and landing, and over-ridden manually as desired by the pilot.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the minimal}} damage inflicted, American morale, {{still reeling from}} the attack on Pearl Harbor and Japan's {{subsequent}} territorial gains, soared when news of the raid was released. The Japanese press was told to describe the attack as a cruel, indiscriminate bombing against civilians, women, and children. After the war, the casualty count was 87 dead, 151 serious injuries, and more than 311 minor injuries; children were among those killed, and newspapers asked their parents to share their opinion on how the captured raiders should be treated. For years before the attack on Pearl Harbor, there had been mock air raid drills in every Japanese city, although China's air force was almost nonexistent; this may {{have been part of the}} process of keeping warlike emotion at a <b>high</b> <b>pitch.</b>|$|E
25|$|Representing the tying {{run at the}} plate, Xander Bogaerts {{struck out}} {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, which ended his hitting streak and the game. Steven Wright had another good outing, {{allowing}} three runs, all unearned, in the second game but could only go five innings, due to a <b>high</b> <b>pitch</b> count. The Red Sox offense scored six time off of Marcus Stroman, which was enough to preserve the win. In the rubber match, the Blue Jays took Eduardo Rodríguez deep four times, for five runs total. Marco Estrada carried a no-hitter into the eighth, but gave up a long ball to Chris Young. To this point all hits in the game were home runs. The Red Sox rallied {{in the bottom of the}} ninth, accumulated five hits, three of them doubles, but fell one run short.
