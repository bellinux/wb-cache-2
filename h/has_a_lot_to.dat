When an enraged and jealous Barry, as Flash, makes an attempt on Eddie, Oliver tries to stop Barry, and the two engage in a fight. Oliver manages to wrangle Barry long enough for Harrison Wells and Joe to use colored strobe light to reset Barry's emotional state. Afterward, Barry and Oliver capture Bivolo and place him in the prison at S.T.A.R. Labs. Due to the incident, Eddie gets the grounds to form a police task force to arrest the Flash. Barry confirms Oliver's belief that the former <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> learn. Oliver advises him to stay away from Iris West, with whom Barry is in love, because men with secret identities never get the girl. Oliver asks Team Flash to keep his alter ego a secret. A new metahuman able to manipulate fire appears in Central City.|$|E

25|$|The Clark Sisters {{were born}} and raised in Detroit, Michigan. They each began singing at an early age, and by the late 1960s they were all {{performing}} together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. A few years later, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who would then go on to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings.

25|$|In the NFC Championship Game, Cutler {{completed}} 6-of-14passes for 80yards and an interception, {{before a}} knee injury sidelined him early {{in the third quarter}} of a 21–14 loss to Green Bay. The Bears did not make an immediate announcement about Cutler's condition, allowing speculation to grow. In possibly the NFL’s first player-on-player social media attack, Cutler was being criticized seconds after the injury by Maurice Jones-Drew, Darnell Dockett, Deion Sanders, and Mark Schlereth. Bears coach Lovie Smith later clarified that he, and not Cutler, made the decision after consulting the medical and training staff. The following day, an MRI revealed Cutler had sprained his MCL. Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman commented that the widespread reaction reflected hostility towards Cutler's career-long polarizing attitude. Bears teammates defended Cutler, and his critics themselves became the targets of insults from other players, including Packers Aaron Rodgers ("disrespectful"), LeRoy Butler ("stupid"), and B. J. Raji ("pretty wrong and a lot times it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> do with jealousy").|$|E

25|$|The EGC is {{composed}} of a mixture of three distinct water masses. The water masses are Polar Water, Atlantic Water, and Deep Water. These water masses can be clearly seen throughout the EGC's tract southward, however, the upper layer water masses do change some due to atmospheric interaction along with inflow from other water sources in the Nordic Seas. The top 150 meters of the EGC is considered polar water and it is cold and low in salinity. The lowness in salinity <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> do with freshwater run off from sea ice melting, river runoff, and Pacific water flux and it is cold due to air-sea interactions while in the Arctic. Typical characteristics for the EGC Polar water are a temperature between 0°C and –1.7°C (e.g. freezing point of low-salinity sea water), and the salinity varies greatly from 30 psu (near the surface) to 34 psu at a 150-meter depth. The layer beneath the Polar Water {{is known as the}} Atlantic Water layer. It extends down to about 1000 m. This layer is defined as having relatively warm temperatures and saline waters. The temperatures are normally above 0°C and have a salinity of 34 psu at 150 meters and it increases to about 35 psu at 1000 meters. The Atlantic water that is seen in the EGC comes from two different sources. The first source of Atlantic Water originates from westward directed Atlantic water in the West Spitsbergen Current. This current sends Atlantic water (AW) into the Fram Strait, and because it is more dense then the surface Polar water it sinks to an intermediate depth. The second source of AW in the EGC originates from recirculated AW in the Arctic. This is AW that has entered the Arctic via the North Atlantic and has been circulating in the Arctic and is now being pushed out of the Arctic via the EGC. The layer beneath the Atlantic Water is simply referred to as the Deep Water where the salinity and temperatures are relatively constant. This level typically extends from 1000 meters {{to the bottom of the}} ocean. The temperatures in this bottom level are normally below 0°C and the salinity is around 34.9 psu.|$|E

500|$|Review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes {{gives the}} film {{a rating of}} 80% based on 41 reviews.

The New York Times called it a [...] "low-budget freak show/cult classic/cultural institution" [...] and considered the songs featured in the film to be [...] "catchy". Geoff Andrew of Time Out noted that the [...] "string of hummable songs gives it momentum, Gray's admirably straight-faced narrator holds it together, and a run on black lingerie takes care of almost everything else", rating it 4 out of 5 stars. Dave Kehr of Chicago Reader on the other hand considered the wit to be [...] "too weak to sustain a film" [...] and thought that the [...] "songs all sound the same".|$|E

[...] "We'd stop if we thought we were just going through the motions...

In January 2011, Gorham maintained that Lynott would have approved of the continuation of the band: [...] "He worked long hours and travelled thousands of miles to get it to a certain level. There's no way he would have said 'No-one should play those songs again.'" ...|$|E

Rather than fussing and fighting we'd better learn to live in peace and live together, because that's the only way to survive." [...] The group is especially focused on educating the world about Africa. Faada Freddy has also stressed the importance of understanding life on the continent: [...] "Nowadays people are tending to show the negative part of Africa but Africa is not only about AIDS, heartache, corruption and all that even though it exists just like everywhere else.

500|$|Sire Records had marketed the [...] "Everybody" [...] single as if Madonna {{was a black}} artist. This {{misconception}} {{was cleared}} by {{the release of the}} music video for the song. Regarding the importance of shooting a music video for the song, Madonna commented that, [...] "If I didn't have a video, I don't think all the kids in the Midwest would know about me. It takes the place of touring. Everybody sees them everywhere. That really <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> do with the success of my album."

Cheered by them, Madonna and her dancers performed their choreographed dance moves, later described as a 'disco act backed by avant-garde dancers.'

Sepinwall said it started slowly, but gradually built to a [...] "very funny, and kinda sweet climax in the conference room". New York magazine writer Will Leitch said [...] "Gossip" [...] appeared to be a return to a more normal Office atmosphere, compared to the surprises and twists of the fifth season. Rick Ingebritson of The Palm Beach Post said he was concerned the season premiere would not be good because Steve Carell, John Krasinski and Ed Helms would be too distracted with their growing film careers.
