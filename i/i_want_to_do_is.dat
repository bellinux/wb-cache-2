500|$|To {{cast the}} series, Jeremy Simmons and Thairin Smothers posted to LGBT Internet forums and {{electronic}} mailing lists, and visited college campuses. In August 2004 they {{traveled around the}} country to meet the shortlisted candidates. Smothers said that their main casting goal was diversity. Diverse representation was also important to T.J. Jourian, one of the four students cast for the show: [...] "What pushed me to do it was the idea of showing trans people of color, pushing beyond the American image of a gay white man." [...] "I didn’t want to be in anything where I was representing the whole community.… What <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> just give another example of a way to be." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to these supposed messages in [...] "Back Off Boogaloo", observers have viewed the song title as Starr's rebuke to McCartney to abandon his legal stand against the Beatles and Apple Corps, which was placed in receivership in March 1971 after a High Court judge found in McCartney's favour. Author Keith Badman writes that [...] "Boogaloo" [...] had [...] "long been cited as Paul's nickname" [...] from his former bandmates Starr, Lennon and George Harrison. While acknowledging that in subsequent years Starr might have chosen to minimise any ill-feeling towards McCartney, Rodriguez notes that the lyrics [...] "just happened to fit perfectly into the 'us vs. Paul' mindset" [...] following the Beatles' break-up, {{to the extent that}} [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] was [...] "as damning as 'Early 1970' had been conciliatory". When tailoring his 1970 composition [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] for Starr to record on the album Ringo (1973), Lennon referenced the song title with the lines [...] "Now I'm only thirty-two / And all <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> boogaloo".|$|E

5000|$|His most {{successful}} recording period was between 1970 and 1980, {{though he has}} since recorded ten studio albums up to 2015. Speaking in 2009 he said, [...] "I write pop songs. End of story. That's all <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> That's all <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> And that's all <b>I</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> {{have no interest in}} just touring, and living in the past." ...|$|R
500|$|A President Aaron Bay-Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and {{producers}} J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels {{to work with}} Stefani on the album. Stefani recalled saying the following to them during a recording session: [...] "'Listen, I don’t care about anything. I don’t care about hits. I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> just say the truth. I just want the truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down {{of all of these}} things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why I cry but I think it's because I remembered {{for the first time since}} I hated you that I used to love you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E
500|$|Amanda Mealing plays Colonel Eleanor Grant, a [...] "smart, tough {{military}} leader who is skilled {{with a gun}} and diplomacy, but knows when to break a rule or two." [...] She is the new head of Section 20, replacing Hugh Collinson from the first series. Mealing described Grant as [...] "hard as nails," [...] "very contained, very direct," [...] and [...] "very driven." [...] Grant is also very distant from her team; [...] "she commands so she is not their pal but, at the same time, the guys are like her family. They spend so much time together moving from place to place. But, in a kind of motherly way, she has to keep them in check and sometimes they need a firm hand." [...] The actress called her role [...] "the best role I've ever had," [...] adding [...] "when I'm doing action scenes like flying in helicopters, the hardest thing is to keep a serious face as all <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> scream for joy." [...] She researched for her role by taking advice from a female officer in a similar high-ranking position as Grant is. One piece of advice the officer gave Mealing was [...] "you mustn't try {{to be one of the}} boys or they'll lose respect for you, but you've got to be in charge." ...|$|E
500|$|Cooder {{recorded}} most of Election Special at Drive-By Studios, {{the living}} room of engineer Martin Pradler's house in North Hollywood. Sessions also took place at Wireland Studios in Chatsworth, California. Pradler later mixed and mastered the album at both recording locations. The album was produced entirely by Cooder. He performed most of the album himself, playing bass, guitar, and mandolin. His son Joachim contributed on drums, and session musician Arnold McCuller sung harmony vocals on the song [...] "Take Your Hands off It". At Drive-By Studios, Cooder recorded songs in a series of unrehearsed, single-take performances, which he felt helped him channel the songs' respective characters more efficiently. He later said of his approach to developing the songs, [...] "The way I think these songs can work is if you don't ponder over it too hard, because the tunes wanna have a spontaneous-combustion effect. What <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> get a certain attitude in the voice, and I can only do that once. By take two, I'm startin' to think about it. By take three, I'm startin' to map it out – it's gone. It's spoiled, y'see? So I need to get through this fast." [...] He first recorded the song [...] "The Wall Street Part of Town" [...] in November 2011. On June 7, 2012, the album's release was announced for a date in August, intended to be a week before the 2012 Republican National Convention.|$|E

500|$|As the {{acoustic}} tour made Grohl realize [...] "we were making music worth listening to, rather than music made for pummelling the person next to you" [...] {{he decided to}} give more importance to the lyrics and [...] "have a connection with the crowd in front of us", considering that among the many compositions the band made on pre-production [...] "the ones that stand out {{are the ones that}} say something". So {{for the first time the}} lyrics started being written before recording begun, with Grohl stating that he [...] "sat in the back of the studio and just wrote every day for about 14 hours a day." [...] Most of the lyrics of the album deal with themes of birth, death and life, which Grohl attributed to the birth of his daughter Violet, considering that having a child [...] "changes your entire outlook on the world", and that he was suddenly more emotional - [...] "So when you're writing music with that in mind or that in your heart, everything just blooms into this fucking incredibly colourful, colourful feeling." [...] Helped by the extensive lyrical preparation, the lyrics also tried to show more of Grohl's feelings, [...] "those things that you've always wanted to do or always wanted to say", with Hawkins adding that he could not listen to [...] "Stranger Things Have Happened" [...] as [...] "I'm one of his best friends, and the last thing <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> read a love letter to his wife or whoever it is." ...|$|E

Holy Bull returned in the Dwyer Stakes at Belmont Park on July 3, where he faced only three rivals. Once again, {{he went to the}} early lead then pulled away in the stretch to win by [...] lengths. [...] "He's an amazing horse," [...] said Croll, who had shipped Holy Bull in from Monmouth Park {{on the day of the}} race.

2500|$|Produced by Steve Lillywhite of U2 fame, Travis' first studio album, 1997's Good Feeling, is a rockier, more upbeat record {{than the}} band's others to date. Recorded at the legendary Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York, {{the place where}} Travis {{favourite}} The Band recorded, the album contained singles such as [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Is</b> Rock", [...] "U16 Girls", the Beatle'esque [...] "Tied to the 90s", [...] "Happy" [...] and [...] "More Than Us". Guest musicians include Page McConnell of Phish playing keyboards on the title track [...] "Good Feeling". The album reached No.9 on the British charts, but with little radio play, it slipped from the charts relatively quickly. Although it heralded Travis' arrival on the British music scene, received extremely positive reviews, and substantially broadened Travis' fan base, it sold just 40,000 copies. Following the release, Travis toured extensively, their live performances further enhancing their reputation. This included support slots in the UK for Oasis, after Noel Gallagher became an outspoken fan.|$|E
2500|$|The band showed promise but had yet {{to evolve}} into a decent line-up capable of {{fulfilling}} it and spent several years treading water. According to their publisher Charlie Pinder: [...] "They were a band {{that everyone in the}} A community knew about and would go and see every now and then. But they weren’t very good. They had quite good songs; Fran always did write good songs." [...] While on a visit to Scotland, American engineer and producer Niko Bolas, a long-time Neil Young and Rolling Stones associate, tuned into a Travis session on Radio Scotland, and heard something in the band's music which instantly made him travel to Perth to see them. Healy: [...] "He told us we were shit, took us in the studio for four days, and taught us how to play properly, like a band. He was ballsy, rude, and New York pushy. He didn't believe my lyrics and told me to write what I believed in and not tell lies. He was Mary Poppins, he sorted us out." [...] The band recorded a five-song demo, which included the song [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Is</b> Rock".|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} {{track is}} the EDM song [...] "Break Free". The song combines the EDM and electro genres. In {{an interview with}} Billboard, Grande described the song as [...] "fantastic and super-experimental for [...] " [...] and stated: [...] "I never thought I'd do an EDM song, but that was an eye-opening experience, and now all <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> dance." [...] The album's first of three ballads, [...] "Best Mistake", features Big Sean. Billboard described it as [...] "A moody ballad that grows stickier upon each listen, [...] "Best Mistake" [...] carries a tidy collection of impressive production details, the momentary string stabs among them". Musically, it is a minimal hip-hop piano ballad lament that utilizes instrumentation from strings and a drum machine. It tells {{a story about a}} couple trying to [...] "make up their minds about the future of their relationship, with deep affection buried underneath their problems." [...] "Be My Baby" [...] featuring Cashmere Cat is a [...] "bouncy R jam". The song was compared with Mariah Carey's songs. The eighth track, [...] "Break Your Heart Right Back", featuring Childish Gambino, is about her boyfriend cheating on her with a man and contains the lyrics [...] "I know you’re mad 'cause I found out / Want you to feel what I feel right now". The song interpolates Diana Ross's [...] "I'm Coming Out." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the sudden}} {{death of his}} grandfather, a grief-stricken Healy shut himself away, refusing to talk to anyone. Emerging a week later, and with a clear vision of where he now wanted Travis and their music to go, Healy {{dispensed}} with the band's management and publicity agent. Having been repeatedly knocked back by the British record industry, the band couldn't afford to stay around the country for another few years and so decided to move to New York, feeling that the U.S. might be more suited to their style of music. However, before leaving Healy told the band that they should send the demo to Charlie Pinder of Sony Music Publishing, who they had known for a few years and regularly sent songs to, saying: [...] "If he's not into it, then we'll go." [...] Pinder was immediately impressed by the song [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>is</b> Rock", which he felt was a dramatic change for the band: [...] "It was harder, more exciting, sexy; all things that they never really were. They turned a corner." [...] After performing a secret gig for Pinder and his boss at Sony, Blair McDonald, they were signed to Sony Music Publishing. The immediate impact of what was a very secret deal was that the line-up was changed—keyboard player Geoff Martyn was removed, and the bassist, Geoff's brother Chris, was replaced with Healy's best friend Dougie Payne—and the band was moved to London, where they were given a rehearsal room and a house.|$|E
2500|$|The lukewarm {{response}} to Monuments to an Elegy caused Corgan {{to change his}} plans for Day for Night. The critic's reviews of Monuments to an Elegy, which holds a rating of 70/100 at Metacritic based on 31 reviews, were criticized by Corgan for being [...] "middling, muddling" [...] reviews and not offering a [...] "fair" [...] evaluation of the album, while also admitting he didn't even read any of the reviews. Corgan said: [...] "I thought for sure I would get really strong reviews for our new album , based on all the feedback I was getting. But I'm getting the same reviews I {{got back in the}} day, these kind of middling, muddling reviews that just won't fucking say: 'This is a fucking brilliant album from a brilliant artist,'" [...] and also elaborated that, [...] "It's not a three-star fucking record. Nobody believes it's a three-star record. Nobody! OK, these people obviously did, so maybe I shouldn't be so absolute. But I've been in this business for 25 years and there is nobody in it who believes this is a three-star record. Nobody!" [...] The original plan was for Monuments to an Elegy to be a pop/rock album and then be followed by an experimental [...] "weird, arty" [...] album, Day for Night. However, the {{response to}} Monuments to an Elegy caused him to re-evaluate the Day for Night demos and decided that, [...] "The Smashing Pumpkins shouldn't be an arty band anymore," [...] and elaborated, [...] "Monuments is me solving a problem of how to get The Smashing Pumpkins back into the mainstream. I had to solve that problem before I can solve problem two, which is where Day for Night comes in. That's why I'd thought 'I'll do the thing I should do, then I'll do the thing I want to do.' But now what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> kick people out of the way." [...] Corgan later revealed that the follow up to Monuments to an Elegy would no longer to be titled Day for Night.|$|E
