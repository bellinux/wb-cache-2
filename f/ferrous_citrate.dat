A significant {{increase in the number of}} neurons that were immunolabeled for the toxic lipid peroxidation product, 4 -hydroxynonenal (HNE) was observed in field CA 3 of the hippocampus, at 1 day, 7 days and 14 days after intracerebroventricular injection of 1 μL of 5 mM <b>ferrous</b> ammonium <b>citrate,</b> compared to ammonium citrate injected controls at these time points. The number of HNE positive cells was fewer at 14 days, compared to 1 day, after <b>ferrous</b> ammonium <b>citrate</b> injection. The changes in HNE imunoreactivity were paralleled by changes in cytoplasmic phospholipase A 2 (cPLA 2) labeling in the pyramidal neurons in adjacent sections, suggesting that some of the HNE could have arisen as a result of peroxidation of arachidonic acid that was released by cPLA 2. Interestingly, despite the HNE and cPLA 2 labeling, no loss of neurons was observed in adjacent Nissl and Fluoro-Jade stained sections. Electron microscopy also showed that the HNE or cPLA 2 labeled cells had features of injured neurons, rather than necrotic neurons. The reduction of HNE immunoreactivity in neurons at 14 days after oxidative injury, and the absence of cell loss at any of the time intervals, shows that hippocampal pyramidal neurons have remarkable ability to recover from a single episode of oxidative stress, if repeated injury such as seizures / excitotoxicity could be avoided...|$|R

40|$|Effect of iron on renal tubular {{epithelial}} cells. Since iron {{has been}} implicated {{as a potential}} nephrotoxin, we examined the effect of iron on several aspects of cultured renal tubular epithelial cell biology. We found that exposure to 10 − 4 M of either the ferrous or ferric form of iron impaired healing of denuded areas made within confluent monolayers of LLC-PK 1 cells. This impairment required 30 to 80 hours of exposure to iron to occur and was also seen in another renal tubular epithelial cell line (MDCK cells). To delineate the potential mechanism(s) of this impairment, we examined {{the expression of a}} key integrin subunit involved in cell-matrix adhesion. Exposure of LLC-PK 1 cells to 10 − 4 M ferric citrate for 72 hours significantly decreased expression of the β 1 integrin subunit as determined by flow cytometry. To determine if iron impairs another process that occurs at the basolateral surface, the effects of 72 hours of exposure to iron on adenylate cyclase activity were examined. Both ferric and <b>ferrous</b> <b>citrate</b> significantly enhanced vasopressin- and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. To examine if iron can regulate proliferation, the effect of iron on 3 H-thymidine uptake was measured. We found that ferric citrate diminished proliferation and this decrease required the presence of either serum or transferrin. To ascertain if iron affected ultrastructure, we used transmission electron microscopy and found that iron accumulation within cells was much more apparent with ferric than <b>ferrous</b> <b>citrate.</b> Ferric iron induced mild-to-moderate cytopathic changes. These results indicate that iron is capable of inducing multiple changes in renal tubular epithelial function.

Thus, the aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate different strategies for cell adaptation to serum-free medium. Three cell types were used to assess the impact of transfection on adaptation: one common CHO-K 1 cell line and two CHO-K 1 cells transfected with different technologies for antibody production. Cultures were started with a known cell concentration in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10 % serum. The effect of five combinations of supplements, that could support cells during adaptation, was tested. These supplements included insulin and trace elements (copper sulfate, zinc sulfate, sodium selenite, ammonium iron <b>citrate,</b> <b>ferrous</b> ammonium sulfate, ammonium metavanadate, nickel chloride and stannous chloride). A methodology of gradual adaptation was followed, consisting on sequential steps of serum reduction, after assuring good cell adaptation from the previous step. After reaching 0. 625 % serum, medium was gradually switched to the chemically defined serum-free EX-CELL CHO DHFR- medium. It was observed that supplements influence cell adaptation to serum-free medium. Indeed, the combinations containing the trace element ammonium iron citrate gave the worst results, with cell death at 2. 5 % serum. In contrast, the combination of ammonium metavanadate, nickel chloride and stannous chloride proved to be the most favorable to the three cell lines. Comparing the cells, it seems that the ability to produce antibody and the transfection methodology used does not have a great impact on adaptation. During the study, some procedure details were identified as particularly important and should be carefully considered in the process of cell adaptation to serum-free medium. These include the use of a higher initial cell concentration that will allow the survival of an increased number of cells during the process; avoiding harsh procedures to the cells such as centrifugation and the use of enzymes (i. e. trypsin), due to a higher cell sensibility during adaptation; and to give enough time for a full cell adaptation at each step...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{powerful}} gradient systems resulted in substantial improvement of image quality in ultrafast MR imaging and therefore novel clinical applications emerged including gastrointestinal (GI) tract imaging. Within this context, MR imaging {{of the small}} and large bowel were developed, providing luminal, transmural and extramural diagnostic information of intestinal diseases. Current clinical applications of MR imaging of the small intestine include diagnostic evaluation and follow-up of patients with inflammatory, systemic and neoplastic diseases, wheras MR Colonography can be performed in patients with incomplete colonoscopies. Contrast Agents Various contrast agents have been proposed for bowel MRI applications (1, 11 - 22). The most important characteristics of an intraluminal contrast agent suitable for gastrointestinal (GI) applications may be summarized into the following: uniform and homogeneous lumen opacification, high contrast resolution between the lumen and bowel wall, no significant adverse effects and low cost. In addition, minimal mucosal absorption and absence of artifact formation are highly desirable for an optimal contrast agent. GI contrast agents can be classified according to their effect on MR images into positive, negative and biphasic. Positive contrast agents such as <b>ferrous</b> ammonium <b>citrates,</b> manganese chloride or iron phytate, produce increased intraluminal signal intensity, while negative contrast agents such as superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), result in decreased signal intensity of the bowel lumen. On T 2 -w images the uniform distribution of the negative contrast within the small and large bowel allows easier visualization of the dark bowel loops within the hyperintense mesenteric fat tissue, thus improving the overall image quality. Biphasic contrast agents, such as methylcellulose, mannitol, sorbitol or polyethylenoglycol (PEG) water solutions, behave as positive or negative, depending on the applied pulse sequence. Small Bowel Route of contrast administration MR Enteroclysis is the only technique that provides sufficient luminal distention to guarantee accurate individual lesion detection. According to the latter technique, patients are examined in the prone position, utilizing a phase-array coil. A total amount of 1, 500 to 2, 000 ml of an isoosmotic water solution (PEG) is administered through a nasojejunal catheter, {{by means of an}} MR compatible pump. A controlled infusion is employed and the contrast is administrated in two phases. At first, a flow rate of 80  150 ml/min is utilized untill the contrast reaches the terminal ileum. In the second phase, the flow rate is increased up to 300 ml/min in order to create reflex atony. Pulse sequences Optimum small bowel imaging should include fast and ultrafast pulse sequences. The spatial resolution of these sequences should be high enough to permitt demonstration of small lesions, such as ulcers or mucosal nodularity, usually present in bowel diseases. Inherent poor signal to noise ratio (SNR) of these sequences must be increased to result in clinically acceptable image quality. All these requirements can be fulfilled by using high-end MR scanners, with field strength of at least 1. 5 Tesla, that can provide higher SNR. Short repetition and echo times, which are of great importance in ultra fast imaging, can be only achieved by using advanced gradient systems. Dedicated abdominal phased-array RF coils should be utilized to further increase the limited SNR of the ultrafast pulse sequences. MR imaging examination protocols of the small bowel usually comprise T 1 - and T 2 -w sequences in axial and coronal planes. Both T 1 - and T 2 -w sequences should be fast enough to allow comfortable breath-hold acquisition times and reduce the motion related artifacts. For T 1 -w images, most authors are using gradient echo sequences in 2 D and 3 D acquisition modes with or without fat saturation prepulses, wheras for T 2 - w images, TSE and HASTE sequences are commonly employed. More recently, the true FISP sequence has been successfully applied in bowel imaging, providing high resolution images of the bowel wall and additional information from the mesentery. Fat-suppressed TSE or STIR sequences have been also applied to assess the activity in Crohns disease. A 3 D version of Spoiled Gradient Echo (SGE) sequences was recently introduced. As opposed to 2 D SGE, 3 D SGE sequences provide increased through-plane and in-plane spatial resolution by obtaining acquisition of thin partitions (2 mm) and high matrices (512), respectively. In addition, they offer higher SNR comparing to the 2 D SGE sequences. The acquisition time for covering the whole small bowel is 22 - 25 sec. and it can be further reduced by employing slice interpolation techniques, such as VIBE, which is becoming a promising one in abdominal imaging. The combination of such sequences with positive intraluminal contrast agents, results in images, which may be used to generate virtual endoscopic views. The major disadvantage of the 3 D FLASH sequence is the increased sensitivity to motion artifacts that may cause blurring of the intestinal wall; administration of antiperistaltic drugs can overcome this drawback. The single shot variant of TSE sequence with half Fourier technique, the so called HASTE sequence, generates heavily T 2 -w images maintaining signals from solid tissues, although with lower resolution. The acquisition time can be as short as 1 sec per slice resulting in minimal respiratory related artifacts. Normal intestinal wall exhibits low SI, while inflammatory or neoplastic lesions exhibit high SI. The long echo train used in HASTE sequence makes it less sensitive to susceptibility artifacts, which may appear in gradient echo sequences due to presence of intraluminal air. Moreover it is not sensitive to chemical shift artifacts and therefore it can be used for accurate quantification of intestinal wall thickness. Sufficient reduction of the endoluminal SI, provided by the use of a negative contrast agent, results in depiction of bowel wall abnormalities with high conspicuity. In case of positive endoluminal contrast agents, HASTE sequence is sensitive to intraluminal flow voids related to peristaltic motion. This problem may be reduced when acquiring HASTE images after spasmolitic drug administration. Another limitation of the HASTE sequence is the poor demonstration of the mesenteric structures due to k-space filtering effects. Tissues with short T 2 relaxation constant, such as lymph nodes and fibrous tissue, are missing the high order spatial frequencies thus resulting in a blurring effect due to the unique way that k- space is filled in HASTE sequence. Large Bowel MR imaging of the large bowel should fullfill the same technical requirements as for imaging the small intestine. The need for a larger field of view requires the use of at least two abdominal array coils. Patients should undergo bowel cleansing prior to the examination. Novel approches, like feacal tagging, show that this prerequisite may become unecessery. Usually the large bowel is distended using a maximum amount of 2 - 3 liters of pure water or gadolinium-spiked water solution, through rectal administration. Antiperstaltic drugs, like scopolamine, should be used to minimize peristaltic artifacts. The so called dark-lumen MR Colonography technique is a combination of administration of pure water that renders the colonic lumen with low signal intensity and i. v. gadolinium injection, which results in high SI of the colonic wall, leading to this double contrast appearance. Bright lumen MR Colonography incorporates the administration of gadolinium-spiked (< 2 %) water solution. In such an approach i. v. gadolinium administration is not necessary. However, two acquisitions should be performed in supine and prone position to differentiate between residual stool or air and polyps, since both present as filling defects. CLINICAL APPLICATIONS Small Bowel Crohns Disease The role of imaging has nowdays expanded to incorporate classification of Crohn disease subtypes. Accurate classification based on MR imaging findings can be achieved when using a technically demanding MRI examination protocol. MR Enteroclysis (MRE) has shown to be highly sensitive to demonstrate superficial, mural and extramural lesions in patients with Crohn disease. Subbtle lesions such as mucosal nodularity, superficial ulcerations and thickening of the folds may be depicted by MRE, although to a lesser extent as compared to conventional enteroclysis, due to its lower spatial resolution. Using true FISP images, MRE can demonstrate the characteristic descrete ulceration of Crohns disease; deep linear ulcers appear as thin lines of high signal intensity, longitudinally or transversely (fissure ulcers) oriented within the thickened bowel wall. Cobblestoning can also be appreciated on MRE images, as patchy areas of high signal intensity, sharply demarcated, along affected small bowel segments. True FISP images are superior to HASTE in demonstrating linear ulcers or cobblestoning and intramural tracts, wheras 3 D FLASH images are less sensitive. Wall thickening is clearly shown by all MRE sequences, provided that the small intestinal lumen is adequately distended. Thickened wall in the absence of extensive edema exhibits low to moderate signal intensity on true FISP and HASTE images. Accurate measurements of bowel wall thickening and estimation of the length of involved segment can be performed on MRE images. Luminal narrowing and associated prestenotic small bowel dilatation are easily recognized with all sequences. MRE was in full agreement with conventional enteroclysis in detecting, localizing, estimating the length of all involved small bowel segments and in assessing thickening of bowel wall, luminal narrowing or high grade stenosis in one series. MRE has reported to have a clear advantage over conventional enteroclysis in the demonstration of exoenteric manifestations or complications of Crohns disease. The extent of fibrofatty proliferation and its fatty or fibrotic composition can be assessed on true FISP images, while it can be only suspected on conventional enteroclysis. Fibrofatty proliferation may present with space-occupying lesion characteristics, separating and/or displacing small bowel loops. The involved mesentery may contain small lymph nodes, mostly less than 8 mm in diameter, easily detected on true FISP images by their low signal intensity against the bright mesenteric fat. Such lymph nodes are not clearly demonstrated on HASTE images, due to k-space filtering effects or on 3 D FLASH images, due to saturation of mesenteric fat signal. Sinus tracts and fistulas are demonstrated by the high signal intensity of their fluid content on true FISP and HASTE images, but they may be overlooked on the 3 D FLASH images, due to limited contrast resolution with surrounding tissues. Abscesses can be recognized by their fluid content and wall enhancement. Large Bowel Although colorectal cancer screening has been advocated as a potential clinical application of MR Colonography, currently it is limited to patients who have undergone incomplete endoscopic colonoscopy (58). The absence of radiation exposure is an attractive feature of MR Colonography for screening applications. However, technical improvements in terms of spatial resolution and minimization of artifacts are still pending. MR Colonography may have a role in staging colorectal carcinoma. As shown in a recent report, tumors were demonstrated in all cases and in 57 % of them breach of the muscularis propria was correctly predicted. Future applications of MR Colonography in staging colorectal carcinoma may be more appealing when combined with state-of-the-art MR imaging of the liver (59). Like for staging, MR Colonography can be also used for postoperative surveillance. In case of inflammatory bowel disease, MR Colonography might offer an alternative technique to colonoscopic evaluation for documenting the extent of disease and assessing disease activity (60). In patients with ulcerative colitis, estimation of disease extension using morphologic criteria known from conventional studies, has shown to be feasible (61). It has been additionally demonstrated that the use of a negative superparamagnetic oral contrast agent provides results comparable to endoscopy in the assessment of activity of ulcerative colitis (62). Moreover, wall thickness measurements are contributing to differentiate patients with mild to moderate disease from those with severe degree of clinical-endoscopic activity. CONCLUSIONS MR imaging is presently contributing to diagnostic assessment of GI diseases. The most important advantages of MR Imaging include superb soft tissue contrast, ability for functional information, direct multiplanar imaging and lack of radiation exposure. Adequate bowel distention, homogeneous lumen opacification, fast sequences with breath hold acquisition times, both T 1 - and T 2 -w imaging and contrast enhancement are cornerstones for an optimal MR imaging examination of the GI Tract. Especially, a comprehensive MR Imaging protocol for the small intestine should comprise SSTSE, true FISP, HASTE and fat suppressed 3 D FLASH sequences. SSTSE is utilized for monitoring the infusion process and performing MR fluoroscopy, while true FISP and HASTE are mainly used for anatomic demonstration and detection of the pathology. 3 D FLASH sequences after I. V. gadolinium injection may aid tissue characterization. Inflammatory or neoplastic diseases, including intestinal wall abnormalities, exoenteric disease manifestations and complications, disease activity and to a lesser extent, mucosal abnormalities can be appreciated on MR Imaging. There are strong indications that staging of gastric cancer and assessment of gastric motility can be reliably performed with MR Imaging. Currently, MR Colonography is considered as an alternative technique to CT Colonography and its most important clinical indication is in patients with incomplete endoscopy. Further technical improvements in terms of spatial resolution may increase its potential role in colorectal cancer screening programs...|$|R

In a rat model involving infusion of <b>ferrous</b> <b>citrate</b> (FC) that simulates iron accumulation after hemorrhage, {{a higher degree}} of autophagy associated with higher injury severity was observed in striatum of males than in females. Since the imbalance between the levels of autophagy and energy demand may lead to cell death, we proposed that FC-induced autophagy is detrimental in a male specific manner and autophagy modulation affects injury severity in a sex-dependent manner. Rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, and conditional knockout gene of autophagy-related protein 7 (Atg 7) in dopamine receptor D 2 (DRD 2) neurons were used to test our hypothesis using a mouse model with striatal FC infusion. The result showed that the levels of autophagic cell death and injury severity were higher in male than in female mice. Pre-treatment of FC-infused females with rapamycin increased the FC-induced behavioral deficit and DRD 2 neuron death. However, DRD 2 neuron-specific knockout of Atg 7 decreased FC-induced injury severity and the number of TUNEL(+) DRD 2 neurons in males. These results suggest that autophagy in FC-infusion males is overactive with maladaptive consequences and inhibition of autophagy decreases the severity of FC-induced striatal injury in males. These findings present prospects for male-specific therapeutic strategy that targets autophagy in patients suffering from iron overload...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 5 -Aminolevulinic acid (5 -ALA) is a {{naturally}} occurring amino acid and precursor of heme and protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Exogenously administrated 5 -ALA increases {{the accumulation of}} PpIX in tumor cells specifically due to the compromised metabolism of 5 -ALA to heme in mitochondria. PpIX emits red fluorescence by the irradiation of blue light {{and the formation of}} reactive oxygen species and singlet oxygen. Thus, performing a photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) using 5 -ALA have given rise to a new strategy for tumor diagnosis and therapy. In addition to the field of tumor therapy, 5 -ALA has been implicated in the treatment of inflammatory disease, autoimmune disease and transplantation due to the anti-inflammation and immunoregulation properties that are elicited with the expression of heme oxygenase (HO) - 1, an inducible enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the oxidative degradation of heme to free iron, biliverdin and carbon monoxide (CO), in combination with sodium <b>ferrous</b> <b>citrate</b> (SFC), because an inhibitor of HO- 1 abolishes the effects of 5 -ALA.

This condition was due to an abnormal Hb present in the red cells of the proband: Hb St. Louis, beta 28 (B 10) replaced by Gln, whose structural characteristics have been previously reported. This unstable Hb represented 30 % of the total and was isolated by starch block electrophoresis at pH 8. 6. Electrophoretic and spectral studies showed Hb St. Louis to be a valency hybird, alpha 2 beta 2 +. The presence of hemichrome in this Hb was detected by electron paramagnetic resonance studies. During this study, an electrophoretic technique was developed that allows study of the mobility of hemichrome. Oxygen equilibria performed on purified Hb St. Louis revealed a high oxygen affinity and a markedly reduced cooperativity. The Bohr effect was normal, but the interaction of this hemoglobin with 2, 3 -diphosphoglycerate was decreased. The oxidation rate of Hb St. Louis was normal. Hb St. Louis was completely reduced by dithionite and <b>ferrous</b> <b>citrate,</b> and the functional properties of this reduced form were normal. In contrast, Hb St. Louis was only partially reduced by diaphorase. The mechanism of the oxidation of Hb St. Louis therefore appears to differ markedly from that postulated for other Hbs M...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{photodynamic}} therapy using 5 -aminolevulinic acid (ALA-PDT) {{has been widely}} used in cancer therapy. ALA administration results in tumor-selective accumulation of the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) via the heme biosynthetic pathway. Although ALA-PDT has selectivity for tumor cells, PpIX is accumulated into cultured normal cells to a small extent, causing side effects. The mechanism of tumor-selective PpIX accumulation is not well understood. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to identify the mechanism of tumor-selective PpIX accumulation after ALA administration. We focused on mitochondrial labile iron ion, which is the substrate for metabolism of PpIX to heme. We investigated differences in iron metabolism between tumor cells and normal cells and found that the amount of mitochondrial labile iron ion in cancer was lower than that in normal cells. This finding could be because of the lower expression of mitoferrins, which are the mitochondrial iron transporters. Accordingly, we added sodium <b>ferrous</b> <b>citrate</b> (SFC) with ALA as a source of iron. As a result, we observed the accumulation of PpIX only in tumor cells, and only these cells showed sensitivity to ALA-PDT. Taken together, these results suggest that the uptake abilities of iron ion into mitochondria play a key role in tumor-selective PpIX accumulation. Using SFC as a source of iron might thus increase the specificity of ALA-PDT effects...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—Accumulation of iron after {{intracerebral}} hemorrhage causes {{free radical}} formation and oxidative damage resulting in liquefaction. The {{aim of this}} study was the investigation of molecular mechanisms underlying estrogen-mediated neuroprotective effect against iron-induced brain injury in vivo. Methods—Age-matched male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were stereotaxically infused with either <b>ferrous</b> <b>citrate</b> (FC) or saline (10 L) into the right caudate nucleus. Beta-estradiol 3 -benzoate (E 2) capsule was implanted subcutaneously at 24 hours before infusion of FC. The severity of brain injury and neurological deficits were measured by histological quantification and forelimb asymmetry test, respectively. The role of thioredoxin (Trx) in E 2 -mediated neuroprotective effect was examined by intrastriatal administration of a Trx reductase inhibitor, 5, 5 -dithiobis-(2 -nitrobenzoic acid), and small interfering RNA. Results—FC induced greater brain injury in male rats than females. E 2 treatment reduced FC-induced brain injury in both sexes. E 2 significantly increased protein level and activity of Trx in the caudate nucleus of females but not males. Administration of female rats with 5, 5 -dithiobis-(2 -nitrobenzoic acid) or Trx small interfering RNA to the caudate nucleus decreased the protective effect of E 2 against FC-induced injury. The protein and mRNA levels of estrogen receptor, but not estrogen receptor, were more abundant in the caudate nucleus of female rats. Conclusions—Increase of brain Trx activity might {{play an important role in}} the E 2 -mediated neuroprotective effect agains...|$|E
40|$|Hemorrhagic stroke caused leakage of {{red blood}} cells which {{converts}} to hemoglobin, heme, and iron accumulated at the lesions. High concentration of ferrous iron from subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) induced cerebral vasospasm. Using the two-hemorrhage SAH model in rats, we previously demonstrated that estradiol (E 2) significantly attenuated the SAH-induced vasospasm by inhibiting the NOS 2 expression. Adding <b>ferrous</b> <b>citrate</b> (FC) complexes to the primary cultured mouse cerebral endothelial cells (CEC) to mimic the SAH conditions, we also showed that FC up-regulates NOS 2 through nuclear translocation of NFkB induced by free radicals generation. Here, we further studied the molecular mechanism underlying E 2 -mediated reduction of the FC-induced up-regulation of NOS 2. Treatment with E 2 (100 nM) reduced the FC (100 mM) -induced increases of free radical generation and the levels of NOS 2 mRNA and protein in the CEC. Moreover, E 2 also prevented the FC-induced increases of IkBa phosphorylation, NFkB nuclear translocation, NFkB binding onto the NOS 2 promoter, and the NOS 2 promoter luciferase activity. However, knock-down the estrogen receptor b (ERb), but not ERa, abolished the E 2 -mediated prevention on the FC-induced increases of NOS 2 mRNA and protein. The data {{from the present study}} suggest that E 2 inhibited NOS 2 gene expression by interfering with NFkB nuclear translocation and NFkB binding onto the NOS 2 through an ERb-mediated pathway. Our results provide the molecular basis for designing the applicabl...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study we provide {{evidence}} for hydroxyl radical (•OH) scavenging action of nitric oxide (NO•), and subsequent dopaminergic neuroprotection in a hemiparkinsonian rat model. Reactive oxygen species are strongly implicated in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity caused by the parkinsonian neurotoxin, 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium (MPP+). Since the role of this free radical as a neurotoxicant or neuroprotectant is debatable, we investigated the effects {{of some of the}} NO• donors such as S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), 3 -morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN- 1), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and nitroglycerin (NG) on in vitro •OH generation in a Fenton-like reaction involving <b>ferrous</b> <b>citrate,</b> as well as in MPP+-induced •OH production in the mitochondria. We also tested whether co-administration of NO• donor and MPP+ could protect against MPP+-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rats. While NG, SNAP and SIN- 1 attenuated MPP+-induced •OH generation in the mitochondria, and in a Fenton-like reaction, SNP caused up to 18 -fold increase in •OH production in the latter reaction. Striatal dopaminergic depletion following intranigral infusion of MPP+ in rats was significantly attenuated by NG, SNAP and SIN- 1, but not by SNP. Solutions of NG, SNAP and SIN- 1, exposed to air for 48 h to remove NO•, when administered similarly failed to attenuate MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in vivo. Conversely, long-time air-exposed SNP solution when administered in rats intranigrally, caused a dose-dependent depletion of the striatal dopamine. These results confirm the involvement of •OH in the nigrostriatal degeneration caused by MPP+, indicate the •OH scavenging ability of NO•, and demonstrate protection by NO• donors against MPP+-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rats...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{hydrogen}} peroxide is generated in a ferrioxalate-induced photoreductive reaction, but information about the effect of organic ligands on the photochemical behaviour of ferrous species is limited. The degradation of the herbicide 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) by a ferrous-catalyzed oxidation in the presence of various ligands such as formate, citrate, malelate, oxalate, and ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) was studied. The experiments were conducted under either dark or irradiated (350 nm) conditions. Forty-two percent and 34 % of 2, 4 -D were removed by the Fe 2 +/oxalate/UV and Fe 2 +/citrate/UV processes, respectively, after 30 min of reaction and oxidative intermediates were obtained in both cases. The presence of hydroxylated intermediates suggests that 2, 4 -D may be attacked by hydroxyl radicals, which are the products of the photo-Fenton-like reaction. As such, hydrogen peroxide was produced by the photolysis of ferrous oxalate or <b>ferrous</b> <b>citrate,</b> referred to hereafter as photogenerated H 2 O 2. As expected, the total removal percentage of 2, 4 -D jumped to 97 % when 1 mM of hydrogen peroxide (so-called spiked H 2 O 2) was externally added to the reaction vessel to initiate the Fe 2 +/oxalate/UV process. Therefore, the treatment of 2, 4 -D by the Fe 2 +/oxalate/H 2 O 2 /UV system can be operated in two steps: the photolysis of ferrous oxalate first, followed by adding the spiked H 2 O 2 sometime after the commencement of the reaction. A two-phase model has been developed to describe this tandem ferrous-catalyzed photooxidation, which would help to achieve the mineralization of 2, 4 -D.

40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} (H 2 O 2) causes cell damage via oxidative stress. Heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) is an {{antioxidant enzyme}} that can protect cardiomyocytes against oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated whether the heme precursor 5 -aminolevulinic acid (5 -ALA) with sodium <b>ferrous</b> <b>citrate</b> (SFC) could protect cardiomyocytes from H 2 O 2 -induced hypertrophy via modulation of HO- 1 expression. HL- 1 cells pretreated with/without 5 -ALA and SFC {{were exposed to}} H 2 O 2 to induce a cardiomyocyte hypertrophy model. Hypertrophy was evaluated by planar morphometry, 3 H-leucine incorporation, and RT-PCR analysis of hypertrophy-related gene expressions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed by 5 / 6 -chloromethyl- 2 ′, 7 ′-ichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetylester. HO- 1 and nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) protein expressions were analyzed by Western blot. In our experiments, HL- 1 cells were transfected with Nrf 2 siRNA or treated with a signal pathway inhibitor. We found several results. 1) ROS production, cell surface area, protein synthesis, and expressions of hypertrophic marker genes, including atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, atrial natriuretic factor, and β-myosin heavy chain, were decreased in HL- 1 cells pretreated with 5 -ALA and SFC. 2) 5 -ALA and SFC increased HO- 1 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner, associated with upregulation of Nrf 2. Notably, Nrf 2 siRNA dramatically reduced HO- 1 expression in HL- 1 cells. 3) ERK 1 / 2, p 38, and SAPK/JNK signaling pathways were activated and modulate 5 -ALA- and SFC-enhanced HO- 1 expression. SB 203580 (p 38 kinase), PD 98059 (ERK), or SP 600125 (JNK) inhibitors significantly reduced this effect. In conclusion, our data suggest that 5 -ALA and SFC protect HL- 1 cells from H 2 O 2 -induced cardiac hypertrophy via activation of the MAPK/Nrf 2 /HO- 1 signaling pathway...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} examine the safety of 5 -aminolevulinic acid {{phosphate}} (5 -ALA) with sodium <b>ferrous</b> <b>citrate</b> (SFC) in diabetic patients treated {{with one or more}} oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs). Background: Recent intervention studies performed in the USA and Japan have shown that a nutritional supplement of 5 -ALA with SFC efficiently reduced blood glucose levels in pre-diabetic population without any adverse events. Thus, it was anticipated that 5 -ALA with SFC may potentially be taken as a beneficial supplement by diabetic patients who were being treated with OHA therapy. Nevertheless, it is important to examine its safety and efficacy in diabetic population. Methods: This study was a prospective single-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled and parallel-group comparison study. Medically treated diabetic patients between the ages of 30 and 75 were recruited from the Tokyo metropolitan area of Japan and 45 subjects were selected after screening. These subjects were randomly assigned to three groups: daily intake of 15 mg 5 -ALA, 50 mg 5 -ALA, and a placebo (n= 15, respectively). The supplement or placebo was administered for 12 weeks followed by a four week washout period. The primary endpoint was safety and occurrence of hypoglycemic attack, while the secondary endpoint was changes of fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c). Results: Adverse events related to 5 -ALA with SFC were not observed in all the groups. Abnormalities in blood and urine tests were not observed either. Significant decrease in FBG was not detected in all the groups. However, there was a small but significant decrease in HbA 1 c at 4 and 8 week in the 15 mg 5 -ALA group. Significant decrease in HbA 1 c was not observed in the 50 mg 5 -ALA group, although a tendency to decrease after 4 weeks was apparent. Conclusion: 5 -ALA with SFC is a safe and potentially beneficial supplement if taken by diabetic patients treated with OHAs...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, {{parasitic}} diseases and low bioavailable iron intake are major causes of anemia. Anemia results from inflammation, preventing iron recycling and decreasing dietary iron absorption. Hookworm, Plasmodium, and Schistosoma infections contribute to anemia, but {{their influence on}} dietary iron absorption and recycling is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to measure inflammation biomarkers, hepcidin, iron absorption, and utilization pre- and posttreatment in children with afebrile malaria, hookworm, and Schistosoma haematobium infection. DESIGN: Ivorian children aged 11 - 17 y with afebrile Plasmodium falciparum (n = 17), hookworm (n = 16), or S. haematobium infection (n = 8) consumed a syrup containing 3 mg (57) Fe as ferrous sulfate and received an intravenous infusion of 50 mug (58) Fe as <b>ferrous</b> <b>citrate.</b> Children were treated for their respective infection, and the iron studies were repeated 4 wk later. Iron and inflammation biomarkers and hepcidin were measured. RESULTS: Geometric mean iron absorptions in the afebrile malaria and hookworm groups were 12. 9 % and 32. 2 % (P < 0. 001) before treatment and 23. 6 % and 30. 0 % (P = 0. 113) after treatment, respectively. Treatment of afebrile malaria reduced inflammation (P < 0. 001) and serum hepcidin (P = 0. 004) and improved iron absorption (P = 0. 003). Treatment of hookworm infection neither affected inflammation biomarkers nor altered iron absorption. Similarly, {{there was a lack}} of treatment effects in the S. haematobium-infected group; however, the small sample size limits conclusions. Geometric mean iron utilization ranged between 79. 1 % and 88. 0 % in the afebrile malaria and hookworm groups with no significant differences pre- and posttreatment. CONCLUSIONS: In school-age children, hookworm infection does not produce inflammation or increase serum hepcidin, and it does not influence iron absorption or utilization. In contrast, afebrile malaria causes inflammation, increases hepcidin, and reduces iron absorption but not utilization. These findings provide insights into the iron metabolism and the etiology of anemia in parasitic infections. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials. gov as NCT 01163877...|$|E
