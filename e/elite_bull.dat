40|$|The {{extensive}} use of {{a limited number of}} <b>elite</b> <b>bulls</b> in cattle breeding can lead to rapid spread of recessively inherited disorders. A recent example is the globally distributed syndrome Complex Vertebral Malformation (CVM), which is characterized by misshapen and fused vertebrae around the cervico-thoracic junction. Here, we show that CVM is caused by a mutation in the Golgi-resident nucleotide-sugar transporter encoded by SLC 35 A 3. Thus, the disease showed complete cosegregation with the mutation in a homozygous state, and proteome patterns indicated abnormal protein glycosylation in tissues of affected animals. In addition, a yeast mutant that is deficient in the transport of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine into its Golgi lumen can be rescued by the wild-type SLC 35 A 3 gene, but not by the mutated gene. These results provide the first demonstration of a genetic disorder associated with a defective SLC 35 A 3 gene, and reveal a new mechanism for malformation of the vertebral column caused by abnormal nucleotide-sugar transport into the Golgi apparatus...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{mastitis}} {{defined as}} a veterinary treatment recorded between 15 d prepartum and 120 d postpartum has been utilised in the national selection scheme since 1980. Economic weight for milk yield compared to mastitis in the total merit index was 4. 5 : 1 in favour of milk yield. From 1990 it became 1. 6 : 1 and later 1 : 1. First lactation records from 1. 7 million cows between 1978 and 1998 have been analysed. Each year 40 % would be daughters of 5 year old test bulls and 60 % daughters of 9 or 10 year old <b>elite</b> <b>bulls.</b> There were substantial non-genetic influences during this period. Milk quality payment according to bacterial and somatic cell count increased veterinary treatments. In 1995 the authorities launched a successful campaign to reduce antibiotics in agriculture by 25 %, creating confounding with the selection pressure on mastitis. Therefore, calving month by year was {{defined as a}} fixed effect to remove external influences. Breeding values for mastitis frequency increased negligible for bulls born between 1971 and 1989, while for bulls born between 1990 and 1993 they improved by 0. 43 % pa. 1...|$|R
40|$|Genomic {{selection}} offers considerable {{flexibility to}} increase genetic trends in dairy cattle breeding. It {{is also an}} opportunity for more sustainable breeding, in terms of breeding goal and genetic variability. With a shorter generation interval, {{there is a big}} risk of increasing inbreeding if semen dissemination policy of <b>elite</b> <b>bulls</b> is not changed. However, using a large number of young bulls as service bulls and bull sires is a solution for both maximizing genetic trend while reducing inbreeding trend. Female genotyping is a key challenge for within-herd selection but, more importantly, for selection of new traits and for replacement of current reference populations based upon progeny-tested bulls. Genomic selection also opens new avenues for more customized breeding across herds or production systems. A big challenge is to reduce the dependency of genomic predictions on relationship between candidates and the reference population. A strong effort is presently dedicated to integrating genome sequence information into predictions, to improve their accuracy and persistency. In the longer term, further customization of selection will be possible by accounting for G × E interactions. Important developments are also necessary to decrease loss of favourable alleles through genetic drift...|$|R

40|$|Cattle genome {{sequencing}} {{has a major}} impact on livestock breeding and provides useful information in the field biotechnology that can ultimately lead to the development of several techniques for early molecular diagnosis. These developments within molecular genetics have made possible the rapid and effective detection of lethal or mutant alleles associated with a disease-specific phenotype by DNA isolation followed by in vitro amplification techniques and enzymatic restriction. DNA tests are currently in use for the detection of heterozygotes and diagnosis of genetic diseases such as bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (BLAD), deficiency of uridine monophosphate synthase (DUMPS) and bovine citrullinemia. These genetic defects are autosomal recessive disorders which were widespread trough advanced reproductive technologies, including artificial insemination and multiple ovulation embryo transfer, as result of selection focused on desirable traits carried by <b>elite</b> <b>bulls</b> with high genetic merit. In order to prevent the risk of dissemination of inherited defects in dairy herds and to decrease the economic losses all bulls have to be tested, although the prevalence of the above mentioned recessive alleles is low. Therefore, it is advisable to use molecular markers to assess bovine health and to implement such programs for the purpose of monitoring hereditary diseases in cattle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Increase of {{production}} and improvement {{of the quality of}} milk, {{as well as of the}} intensity of fertility, are main prerequisites of modern cattle production. For the purpose {{of production}} of domestic Simmental bulls it is necessary to select the best cows from main herd. These heads as a rule represent approx. 1 % of best cows in the controlled population primary in regard to production of milk and milk fat, but also in regard to body development, udder development and fertility traits. Fertilization of bull dams is done according to adequate system, where, for each dam, annually, bull, previously selected as sire, is determined, whose semen will be used for her insemination. Since the fastest way for selection and genetic progress is sire-son line, the most attention is directed to selection of bull sires. In Serbia, annually, only very few bulls are tested, which is insufficient for realization of greater and faster genetic improvement {{of production and}} reproduction traits of Simmental population of cattle. Therefore, centres for artificial insemination often import semen of <b>elite</b> <b>bulls</b> for planned insemination of Simmental bull dams, or borrow young bulls from abroad (waiting bulls) whose semen is used for insemination of main population. In this paper criteria for selection of cows into category of bull dams are presented as well as results relating to milk production, fertility, body development and type score of bull dams of Simmental breed in Central Serbia. Key words: Simmental breed, bull dams, bull sires, selection...|$|R
40|$|The {{health and}} {{well-being}} of cattle is a significant concern for global agricultural output. In dairy production within low and middle income countries (LMICs), there is a significant biosensing challenge in detecting sexually transmitted infection (STI) pathogens during animal husbandry, due in part to difficulties associated with the limited infrastructure for veterinary medicine. Here we demonstrate low-cost, multiplexed and sample-to-answer paper-origami tests for the detection of three bovine infectious reproductive diseases in semen samples, collected at a test site in rural India. Pathogen DNA from one viral pathogen, Bovine Herpes virus- 1 (BoHV- 1) and two bacteria (Brucella and Leptospira) was extracted, amplified (using loop-mediated isothermal amplification, LAMP) and detected fluorescently, enabling < 1 pg (~ from 115 to 274 copies per reaction) of target genomic DNA to be measured. Data was collected as a fluorescence signal either visually, using a low-cost hand-held torch, or digitally with a mobile-phone camera. Limits of detection and sensitivities of the paper-origami device for the three pathogens were also evaluated using pathogen-inoculated semen samples and were as few as 50 Leptospira organisms, 50 CFU Brucella and 1 TCID 50. BoHV- 1. Semen samples from <b>elite</b> <b>bulls</b> at a germplasm centre were also tested in double-blind tests, as a demonstrator for a low cost, user-friendly point-of-care sensing platform, for in-the-field resource-limited regions. The sensors showed excellent levels of sensitivity and specificity, and for the first of time a demonstrated ability of the application of paper-origami devices for the diagnosis multiple infectious diseases from semen samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of selection of beef breeds for terminal crossing has been analysed {{in terms of}} selection criteria for growth and methods for selection of sires, notably {{with reference to the}} situation and research in France. With respect to selection of specialized beef lines, the advantage of control of the individual feed intake and of carcass performances as compared to control of growth only is shortly discussed. For this purpose, not only the favourable indirect response but also the resulting increment of feed intake and changes in body composition according to the reference system used (weight, duration, age) should be taken into account. Because of the increase in birth weight due to the intensification of selection for muscle growth within the beef breeds and the strong genetic correlation between this weight and the paternal component of calving difficulties, it seems advisable to use restricted indices for selection on birth weight, at least for terminal sire lines used in heifers. In the French situation of terminal crossing practised on suckling cows of dual purpose or hardy breeds with the aim of producing veal calves, a special {{attention has been paid to}} the genetic and economic advantage of two stage selection for choosing bull sires: selection on a station performance test (12 -month-weight), selection on a field progeny test (3 -month-weight). Although progeny testing is absolutely required for this type of selection, it has not necessarily to be applied to AI bulls before their commercial use; it might be sufficient to choose the bulls after performance testing provided the latter is realized on sons of <b>elite</b> <b>bulls...</b>|$|R
40|$|Strategies of {{selection}} within local populations and of {{importation of semen}} and embryos from countries with higher genetic merit are evaluated for genetic improvement of milk yield in Zimbabwe. Local programs are progeny testing in a closed population, progeny testing com-bined with semen importation to sire 30 % of cows, progeny testing with for-eign sires as sires of bulls, and a closed nucleus selection scheme using embryo transfer started from elite imported stock. Strategies based on continuous importa-tion are imported semen for 30, 50, or 100 % of cows and semen from <b>elite</b> foreign <b>bulls</b> used on local <b>elite</b> cows and <b>bulls</b> from <b>elite</b> imported embryos. Gene flow methods were used to esti-mate the genetic means for the strategies. In predicted genetic response at 25 yr, continuous importation of all semen from the superior exporting country ranks first; second is the importation of elite embryos to provide bulls for AI; and third is the closed nucleus scheme using embryo transfer. Schemes involv-ing importation of semen to breed bulls with local progeny testing are intermedi-ate, and the lowest responses come from semen imported to breed cows and from the closed local progeny-testing scheme. Ranking of the strategies {{is influenced by the}} genetic correlation of performance and by the initial genetic difference be-tween Zimbabwe and the exporting country.

40|$|An {{extender}} {{has been}} developed with low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) that eliminates the microbial risks {{associated with the use}} of whole egg yolk. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of substituting egg yolk with LDLs for use as an extender in sperm preservation at 4 degrees C, as well as on spermatozoa motility, plasma membrane and acrosome integrity, at two different concentrations (80 x 10 (6) and 240 x 10 (6) sperm per ml) for 8 days and to evaluate glycerol toxicity in both extenders. A total of 12 ejaculates were collected from three bulls. Spermatozoa motility was examined using computer-assisted semen analysis. Plasma membrane integrity was determined using the hypo-osmotic swelling test and acrosome integrity with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-Pisum sativum agglutinin test. The semen was subsequently divided into four aliquots and diluted with Tris-egg yolk-glycerol (TEG), Tris-egg yolk without glycerol (TE), LDL with glycerol (LDL(+)) and LDL without glycerol (LDL(-)), at 80 x 10 (6) and 240 x 10 (6) sperm per ml. This study showed that the LDL 1 and LDL 2 extenders were more effective at preserving spermatozoa motility, plasma membrane integrity and acrosome integrity than TEG and TE (P < 0. 05) during 8 days of incubation. After 3 days of incubation, a toxicity of glycerol was observed in TEG, whereas no significant difference was observed between LDL(+) and LDL(-). We can therefore conclude that the LDL extender can be used to refrigerate semen at 4 degrees C instead of TEG and TE at 80 x 10 (6) and 240 x 10 (6) sperm per ml for <b>elite</b> <b>bulls.</b> This finding can be used to define a policy for the storage of high-quality bull semen.
