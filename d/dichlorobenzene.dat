The enrichment cultures originated from percolation columns filled with Rhine River sediment in which dechlorination of TCBs and <b>dichlorobenzenes</b> (DCBs) occurred.

Dechlorinating activity could only be maintained when an electron donor was added. Lactate, ethanol, and hydrogen appeared to be the best substrates. Optimal temperature and pH for dechlorination were 30 degrees C and 7. 2, respectively. The specificity of the enrichment on lactate and 1, 2, 3 -TCB was tested after approximately 60 transfers (after 2. 5 years). HCB and QCB were stoichiometrically dechlorinated to 1, 3, 5 -TCB and minor amounts of 1, 2, 4 -TCB. 1, 3, 5 -TCB was the sole product formed from 1, 2, 3, 5 -TeCB, while 1, 2, 3, 4 -TeCB and 1, 2, 4, 5 -TeCB were converted to 1, 2, 4 -TCB. 1, 2, 4 -TCB, 1, 3, 5 -TCB, and the three isomers of DCB were not dechlorinated during 4 weeks of incubation. For further enrichment of the 1, 2, 3 -TCB-dechlorinating bacteria, a two-liquid-phase (hexadecane-water) system was used with hydrogen as the electron donor and 1, 2, 3 -TCB or CO 2 as the electron acceptor. Methanogens and acetogens were the major substrate-competing (H 2 -CO 2) microorganisms in the two-liquid-phase system. Inhibition of methanogenesis by 2 -bromoethanesulfonic acid did not influence dechlorination, and acetogens which were isolated from the enrichment culture did not have dechlorinating activity.

40|$|Polychlorinated benzenes are {{recalcitrant}} environmental pollutants {{primarily because}} they are resistant to attack by dioxygenases commonly used by micro-organisms for the biodegradation of aromatic compounds.

Wild-type CYP 101 had low activity for the oxidation of <b>dichlorobenzenes</b> and trichlorobenzenes to the chlorophenols, but no products were detected for the heavily chlorinated benzenes.

Decreasing the space available {{at the top of the}} active site with the F 87 W mutation to force the substrate to be bound closer to the haem resulted in a further 10 -fold increase in activity with most substrates.

This structure is consistent with a Jahn-Teller distorted C 2 v structure. The three BDEs of benzene were compared with those of cyclopropane, stressing the similarities between 1, 3, 5 -tris(dehydro) benzene and cyclopropenyl radical. ^ The heats of formation 1, 2, 3 - and 1, 2, 4 -tris(dehydro) benzene were derived from <b>dichlorobenzenes</b> via four independent thermochemical measurements in an approach similar to that carried out for the 1, 3, 5 -triradical. The third BDE of benzene to form the 1, 2, 4 -triradical from o-benzene is comparable to that to form the 1, 3, 5 -triradical from m-benzene. This indicates that this triradical is also a lone phenyl radical, which, in this case, is separated from an o-benzene moiety {{on the other side of}} the aromatic ring. The third BDE of benzene to form the 1, 2, 3 -triradical, however, is somewhat lower.

Testing various electron transfer mediators for catalysing the dechlorination of hexachlorobenzene showed that neutral red and AQDS were efficient catalysts. In the presence of neutral red a loss of 58 % was attributed to biological reductive dechlorination, and a total loss of 81 % {{in the presence of}} AQDS was apparent. While cyanocobalamin and cobalt salen in isolation did not appear as suitable catalysts for the dechlorination of hexachlorobenzene, a loss of 77 % was attributable to biological reductive dechlorination of hexachlorobenzene using the electron mediators in combination. Tri- and <b>dichlorobenzenes</b> did not accumulate, indicative of that the catalysts were involved in both reductive and oxidative reactions. In the co-contaminated soil, dechlorination of hexachlorobenzene was observed in the presence of 0. 7 % emulsified vegetable oil, but not with a single addition of electron donors. Cyanocobalamin did not appear to have an effect hexachlorobenzene degradation in the co-contaminated soil. In activated sludge samples, dechlorination of perchloroethylene was achieved within four days, and the reaction was independent of electron transfer mediator and electron donor. A dose response of perchloroethylene dechlorination to cyanocobalamin concentration was apparent in co-contaminated soil, but not in the presence of neutral red, where a 96 % loss was observed. Dechorination of hexachloro- 1, 3 -butadiene could be catalysed by cyanocobalamin and cobalt salen with a single addition of electron donor in activated sludge treatments. A dose response of the reaction to cyanocobalamin concentration was apparent in activated sludge treatments and co-contaminated soil, where a greater production of partial and completely dechlorinated daughter products with increasing cyanocobalamin concentrations.
