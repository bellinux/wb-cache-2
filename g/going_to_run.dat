5|$|The {{increased}} speculation led some, like former {{spokesman for}} Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign Phil Singer, to criticize Matthews for openly weighing {{a political campaign}} bid {{while working as a}} news broadcaster. Singer believed Matthews should resign or be suspended from the network until a decision was made. Speculation grew as Matthews spent much of 2008 attending meetings with Pennsylvania representatives and major Democratic fundraisers. Matthews discussed a possible campaign with Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, and poll numbers for a theoretical race showed him only three percentage points behind Specter. However, the speculation came to an end on January 7, 2009, when Matthews told his Hardball staff he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for Senate. Such media outlets as The New York Times and The Washington Post suggested Matthews' alleged consideration was a tactic to ensure a higher salary during negotiations with MSNBC to renew his contract, which was set to expire in June 2009.|$|E

25|$|Minh opposed General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, who {{was still}} {{supported}} by the United States. Minh was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> against Thiệu in the 1971 election but he withdrew because it became obvious to him (and most other observers) that the election would be rigged, due {{to a series of}} restrictions against would-be opponents. Thiệu was then the only candidate and retained power. Minh kept a low profile after this and was relatively politically inert.|$|E

25|$|On June 18, 2015 Kudrin {{proposed}} to hold early presidential elections. He justified this need for global reform and cited {{the example of}} the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, who did just that. State Duma deputy from the party A Just Russia Mikhail Emelyanov considered this statement Kudrin's entry into the presidential race. The next day, Alexei Kudrin said that he is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for the presidency, however, many experts believe that Kudrin wants to return to the Federal Government, and even take the place of the Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|Mesrop II Mutafyan, the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople was {{diagnosed}} with Alzheimer's disease in July 2008, and was incapable of running the Patriarchate since then. This led the Armenian community to a painful condition of uncertainty. In late 2009, the Patriarchate’s Religious Council wrote to the Turkish government seeking permission to elect a coadjutor (co-Patriarch). Three bishops stated that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for the elections: Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian, Archbishop Karekin Bekchian – the Primate of the Armenian Church Diocese of Germany, and Archbishop Aram Ateshian – {{the chairman of the}} Supreme Spiritual Council of the Patriarchate of Istanbul.|$|E
25|$|Ervin gained lasting fame {{through his}} {{stewardship}} of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Campaign Practices, {{also known as the}} Senate Watergate Committee, from the 1972 presidential election. Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield chose Ervin because it was unlikely Ervin was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for re-election in 1974 (and in fact did not), because he had no aspirations beyond his office, because of his knowledge of the law and the Constitution, and because he was an even-keeled, conservative, independent-minded Democrat. President Nixon thought at first that Ervin might potentially be partial to him, but that turned out to not be the case.|$|E

25|$|On February 27, 2008, Bloomberg {{announced}} that he would not run for president in 2008, and that he would endorse a candidate who takes an independent and non-partisan approach. He had also stated unequivocally, live on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, December 31, 2007, that he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for president in 2008. Despite prior public statements by Bloomberg denying plans for a presidential run, many pundits believed Bloomberg would announce a campaign at a later date. On January 7, 2008, he met at the University of Oklahoma with a bipartisan group, including (now former) Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel and former Georgia Senator Sam Nunn, both of whom had been frequently mentioned as possible running mates – to pressure the major party candidates to promote national unity and reduce partisan gridlock. Speculation that Bloomberg would choose this forum to announce his candidacy proved to be unfounded.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2008 season, Wood Brothers Racing and JTG Racing {{split into}} two teams. Ambrose was {{scheduled}} to drive for both teams in Sprint Cup competition in 2008. He was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> twelve races in the No. 21 car for the Wood Brothers and another four in the No. 47 car for JTG Racing. However, due to various issues he only ran 11 of the 16 planned races. He ran well in the Toyota-Save Mart 350 at Infineon, qualifying 7th out of 47 drivers and was running in the top three, but his No. 21 spun through the famous Turn 11 hairpin and blowing his transmission, finishing a disappointing 42nd in the 43-car field. He attempted to make his second career Sprint Cup start in the Lenox Industrial Tools 301 at New Hampshire, but failed to qualify, qualifying 45 out of 45. Again, 43 cars would start, and again, he attempted to qualify the 21 car. He also drove the full Nationwide Series schedule.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E

25|$|Dahmer then brandished a {{knife and}} {{informed}} Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he {{would allow him to}} do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV; Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and chanting before turning his attention back to him: he placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his heartbeat and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart. In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and that he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away. (Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity.) When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning, to which Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again. When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.|$|E
25|$|With {{the defeat}} of Adams, Clay became {{the leader of the}} National Republicans. In 1830, Clay began making {{preparations}} for a presidential campaign in the 1832 election. Early in Jackson's presidency, many doubted that Jackson would seek a second term, and Clay, Vice President John Calhoun, and former Treasury Secretary William Crawford (whose health had somewhat improved since 1824) all began preparations for the upcoming election. In 1831, Jackson {{made it clear that he}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for re-election, ensuring that support or opposition to his presidency would be a central feature of the upcoming race. While the two previous elections had essentially been intra-party contests among Democratic-Republicans, the election of 1832 saw the development of discrete political parties. Jackson's Democrats rallied around his policies towards the national bank, internal improvements, Indian removal, and nullification, but these policies also earned Jackson various enemies. John C. Calhoun's Nullifier faction opposed Jackson after the president took a strong stance against nullification, but the Nullifiers and National Republicans disagreed about the tariff, limiting the possibility of cooperation. The Anti-Masonic Party, a new political party opposed to Freemasonry, nominated former Attorney William Wirt for president. Clay, himself a Freemason, considered withdrawing from the race in hopes of unifying Jackson's opponents, but he ultimately decided to stay in the race. Inspired by the Anti-Masonic Party's national convention, Clay's followers arranged for a national nominating convention, with the intention of anointing Clay as the National Republican nominee. Facing little opposition at the convention, Clay won the party's presidential nomination, and the convention nominated Pennsylvania Congressman John Sergeant as Clay's running mate. As the election approached, the debate over the re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States emerged as the most important issue. In his veto of the bank, Jackson effectively made the case that the bank was a tool of the elites, bolstering his popularity with the people.|$|E
