50|$|There are two {{different}} types of phototool made of different material, while serve the same purpose in PCB manufacturing, silver halide film, and <b>diazo</b> <b>film,</b> the name of it define what it made of.|$|E
50|$|Diazo phototool is of more {{competitive}} cost and durability, generally {{can be used}} for over 300 times of exposure. <b>Diazo</b> <b>Film</b> designed to function as a working master in the manufacture of printed circuit boards. Unlike silver halide films, diazo can be handled in yellow room light and is processed using ammonia vapors and heat.|$|E
50|$|To further {{develop the}} system, in January 1958 IBM hired Jack Kuehler {{to head up}} a team {{exploring}} Kalvar-based films. He quickly concluded that Kalvar was not stable enough to store data {{with the sort of}} reliability IBM demanded, breaking down over a period of a few years and giving off corrosive gas while it did so. Kalvar is based on a <b>diazo</b> <b>film</b> and Kuehler was able to identify a similar film that would provide the reliability required, although at the price of needing to be developed in a wet lab process. He proposed a new version of Walnut that replaced the Kalvar developer with an automated <b>diazo</b> <b>film</b> developer system that developed the film in a few minutes. He was able to convince the CIA to accept this change, and the new version was announced in 1961 and delivered the next year.|$|E
50|$|A phototool is {{prepared}} {{which is a}} negative image of the desired copper electrically conductive circuitry, and this is typically a silver halide photographic emulsion, or <b>diazo</b> phototool <b>film</b> with emulsion.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{preserve}} important seismological documents and make them available inexpensively, the California Institute of Technology Archives (with partial financial support from the U. S. Geological Survey) has initiated seismology microfiche publications. The microfiche (Mf.) format is <b>diazo</b> positive <b>film</b> measuring 105 by 148 mm (4 " by 6 " size). Each microfiche contains 70 frames or less at a maximum reduction of 24 X...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Limonitic alteration halos associated with two copper prophyry deposits were successfully mapped at Battle Mountain. Alteration halos from both a hypogene system at Copper Canyon and a supergene system at Copper Basin are recognizable in the composite. Both copper porphyry deposits {{are located in}} sedimentary rock units that commonly have ferruginous coatings; yet, in most cases, the hydrothermally derived limonite was distinguishable in the CRC from sedimentary limonite. Large format playback images with pixel sizes from 200 to 400 micron m provided details of spatial resolution and color separation unachievable on enlargements from 70 mm film chips. Details of the alteration halos could be resolved only in the large format images. Two aspects of the alteration halos of the porphyry copper deposits were not mapped on the CRC. The optimum CRC image for the area studied consists of MSS 4 / 5 as blue, MSS 4 / 6 as yellow, and MSS 6 / 7 as magenta using <b>diazo</b> <b>films.</b> The disseminated gold deposits at Gold Acres are not depicted in the CRC image...|$|R
5000|$|When Walnut was {{successfully}} delivered in 1961, the San Jose lab turned {{its attention to}} commercializing the system under the project name [...] "Cypress". A direct analog of Walnut for document storage became the 1350 Photo Image Retrieval System, while the same basic system storing computer data became the 1360 Photo-Digital Storage System. Both systems used the same photographic cards and automated film development system originally developed for Walnut, but replacing the <b>diazo</b> <b>film</b> with longer-lasting conventional silver halide films. The system used pneumatics to move the film cards between the more complex developer system, the reader/copier, and a much larger store.Jack Harker was the Program Manager for the development and delivery of the systems.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine quality criteria for continuous-tone <b>diazo</b> <b>film</b> reproductions. The rank-order method was used to acquire judgement data {{from a group of}} experienced photographic scientists evaluating diazo reproductions varying in exposure level and tone reproduction contrast. Analysis of the data resulted in the conclusion that a high degree of agreement does exist between the judges, the quality of a diazo copy depends significantly on the exposure level and the silver positive input, and maximum density and tone reproduction contrast could be possible quality criteria for diazo reproductions...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{model has}} been devised to {{selectively}} construct several points within a scene using multispectral imagery. The model correlates black-and-white density values to color components of <b>diazo</b> <b>film</b> so as to maximize the color contrast {{of two or three}} points per composite. The CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) color coordinate system is used as a quantitative reference to locate these points in color space. Superimposed on this quantitative reference is a perceptional framework which functionally contrasts color values in a psychophysical sense. This methodology permits a more quantitative approach to the manual interpretation of multispectral imagery while resulting in improved accuracy and lower costs...|$|E
40|$|A general {{overview}} of microform usage in libraries is provided, emphasizing {{the impact of}} conversion of print materials to microforms on library patrons and library staff members. Diagnostic techniques are analyzed to determine the adaptability of both collections and clientele. Problems concerning the standardization of hardware, selection of the proper microform formats, {{and the use of}} silver halide, <b>diazo,</b> or vesicular <b>films</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesised}} that generation of nitrogen during exposure by diazo duplication materials {{can contribute to}} image degradations in microform and aerial negative reproductions. Research was conducted to investigate the rate generated gas is diffused from the surface and possible film- film separations this gas may cause during contact printing. Apparatus was constructed to measure gas diffusion rates and simulated film-film separations during exposure. Diffused gas was collected in a rubber diaphragm whose expansion was measured using a variable capacitor tuned oscillator technique. To simulate printer film- film separations movement of a 5. 4 x 7. 5 cm. glass plate placed on the film was measured during exposure. A metal-halide mercury vapor lamp and optical system in the apparatus projected sufficient energy to destroy one half the potential density in 2. 4 to 5, 7 seconds. This time depended upon the type of film - 10 - 9 used. Measured gas diffusion rates ranged from 3. 3 x 10 to 9. 2 x 10 mole/sq cm/sec for the four positive working <b>diazo</b> <b>films</b> evaluated. Platefilm separations up to 2. 2 - urn were measured. It was also determined that gas release is not instantaneous upon exposure and that gas continues to be diffused after exposure has terminated. In addition exposures from {{the top and bottom}} of the emulsion produce different initial gas release rates. Analytical models were developed to correlate experimental data with printer film- film separations. Measured plate-film separations were less than predicted by the models. It is believed that the models are correct and that during the plate- film separation experiments the film had an initial curl, thus violating the parallel initial zero separation condition and explaining the differences...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Three sites were evaluated for land use inventory: Finger Lakes - Tompkins County, Lower Hudson Valley - Newburgh, and Suffolk County - Long Island. Special photo enhancement processes {{were developed to}} standardize the density range and contrast among S 190 A negatives. Enhanced black and white enlargements were converted to color by contact printing onto <b>diazo</b> <b>film.</b> A color prediction model related the density values on each spectral band for each category of land use to the spectral properties of the various diazo dyes. The S 190 A multispectral system proved to be almost {{as effective as the}} S 190 B high resolution camera for inventorying land use. Aggregate error for Level 1 averaged about 12 % while Level 2 aggregate error averaged about 25 %. The S 190 A system proved to be much superior to LANDSAT in inventorying land use, primarily because of increased resolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The feasibility of accomplishing a general inventory {{of any given}} region based on spectral categories from satellite data has been demonstrated in a pilot study for an area of 6300 square kilometers in central New York State. This was accomplished by developing special processing techniques to improve and balance contrast and density for each spectral band of an image scene to compare with a standard range of density and contrast found to be acceptable for interpretation of the scene. <b>Diazo</b> <b>film</b> transparencies were made from enlarged black and white transparencies of each spectral band. Color composites were constructed from these diazo films in combinations of hue and spectral bands to enhance different spectral features in the scene. Interpretation and data takeoff was accomplished manually by translating interpreted areas onto an overlay to construct a spectral map. The minimum area interpreted was 25 hectares. The minimum area geographically referenced was one square kilometer. The interpretation and referencing of data from ERTS- 1 {{was found to be}} about 88 % accurate for eight primary spectral categories...|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Multidiscipline team interpretation and mapping of resources for Crook County is nearly complete on 1 : 250, 000 scale enlargements of ERTS- 1 imagery. Maps of geology, landforms, soils and vegetation-land use are being interpreted to show limitations, suitabilities and geologic hazards for land use planning. Mapping of lineaments and structures from ERTS- 1 imagery {{has shown a}} number of features not previously mapped in Oregon. A timber inventory of Ochoco National Forest has been made. Inventory of forest clear-cutting practices has been successfully demonstrated with ERTS- 1 color composites. Soil tonal differences in fallow fields shown on ERTS- 1 correspond with major soil boundaries in loess-mantled terrain. A digital classification system used for discriminating natural vegetation and geologic materials classes {{has been successful in}} separation of most major classes around Newberry Cauldera, Mt. Washington and Big Summit Prairie. Computer routines are available for correction of scanner data variations; and for matching scales and coordinates between digital and photographic imagery.
