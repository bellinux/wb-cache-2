40|$|Competitive {{conditions}} are leading to much experimentation within and decentralization of the German employment relations system. In this aritcle, I show how <b>flexible</b> working <b>time</b> {{is an integral}} part of the German employment relations system and how <b>flexible</b> working <b>time</b> arrangements are contributing to its transformation. In addition, I discuss the implications for employers and employees of <b>flexible</b> working <b>time,</b> and the lessons the German experience with <b>flexible</b> working <b>time</b> has for the United States. <b>Flexible</b> working <b>time</b> contributes to the decentralization of German employment relations on multiple levels, particularly within the enterprise. The benefits to employers of <b>flexible</b> working <b>time</b> take many forms and are generally positive, whereas the implications for employees are more mixed. The main lesson for the United States is that labor market insitutions still matter in developing <b>flexible</b> working <b>time</b> models that can meet both employer and employee needs. <b>Flexible</b> Working <b>Time,</b> German Employment Relations, Decentralization, Pacts for Employment and Competitiveness, Working Time Accounts...|$|R

40|$|In {{the modern}} power system, {{characterization}} of customer's demand plays {{a vital role}} for Demand Side Management. Demand flexibility information, extracted from the aggregate demand behaviour of customers, presents more comprehensive picture for the aggregator or system operator. There is an existence of diverse <b>flexible</b> <b>time</b> slots during a day in different time periods. Due to the diverse energy consumption behaviour of the residential customers, extraction of flexibility and its associated potential time durations is a challenging task. To extract flexibility information from aggregate residential customers, a flexibility indicator is formulated in this paper. Information presented gives an indication about <b>flexible</b> <b>time</b> slots in terms of numerical value that is useful for a system operator or an aggregator for demand side flexibility assessment and this will lead to design and initiate DSM programs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Timed {{specifications}} {{are often}} formalised at an absolute level of pre-cision, {{which does not}} reflect the real world that the specifications model, i. e., in the real world, inputs cannot be sampled with absolute precision and physical hard-ware cannot react instantaneously. As a result the developed specifications can often become unimplementable. In this paper, we consider the <b>time</b> <b>bands</b> model which allows time to be structured into several layers of abstraction and relationships be-tween bands to be formalised. This allows the timed specifications developed under idealised assumptions to be approximated using the <b>time</b> <b>band</b> in which the variables are sampled. We implement the approximated specifications using teleo-reactive programs embedded with <b>time</b> <b>bands...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the <b>flexible</b> working <b>time</b> arrangements in Bulgaria, using a life-course perspective. Two important features have to be outlined, namely: underdeveloped flexible forms of employment in the country, including working time arrangement, and lack of previous analysis on <b>flexible</b> working <b>time</b> arrangements from the angle of life-course perspective. The author describes the regulatory framework, collective agreements at national and company level as a frame within which different forms of <b>flexible</b> working <b>time</b> arrangements by gender develop. The study points out that there are no significant gaps concerning work engagement under different working time schemes. It is mentioned that the existing legal frame gives relatively good opportunities for the <b>flexible</b> working <b>time</b> arrangement to be in practice. However, crossing the issue of flexibility in working time arrangement with working life cycle, the author outlines more gender differences, e. g. more young people in flexible types of employment; more women employed part-time, etc. ...|$|R
