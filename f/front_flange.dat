50|$|As {{with the}} 7.5 cm Pak 40, the muzzle brake of the KwK 40 and StuK 40 {{went through a}} series of design changes. Five types of muzzle brakes were used, {{gradually}} increasing the area of exposure to the blast. The designs progressed from tubular type double baffle muzzle brakes to single baffle ball shape muzzle brakes, which proved to be insufficient in reducing recoil, followed by a double flange type from May 1943. The <b>front</b> <b>flange</b> and rear disk type was used from March 1944, followed finally by the double disc type.|$|E
30|$|There {{are some}} {{experiments}} {{where we want}} to study ions, ionic clusters, meta-stable atoms or molecular radicals. There were several attempts to combine a nozzle with electrical or laser discharge scheme to produce these species. In most cases the excitation process warms the supersonic jet, or contaminates it with sputtered electrode material [47 – 52]. We have developed a new type of electrode less Dielectric Barrier Discharge [53 – 56] source that does not heat the jet or contaminates it [57]. The source is attached to the <b>front</b> <b>flange</b> of the Even-Lavie valve and uses a built in disk magnet to confine the discharge electrons. It operates on a series of rapid high voltage pulses.|$|E
40|$|An upgrade for {{the front}} section of the Nuclotron Injector is presented. The aim of this upgrade is to {{decrease}} the minimal charge-to-mass ratio of ions accelerated from 0. 33 to 0. 28. It consists of a transverse wall placed 1. 1 m from the <b>front</b> <b>flange</b> of the linac, separating the 14. 4 meter tank into two distinct RF cavities, and replacement of the 11 drift tubes in the first cavity, extending the transverse acceptance of the linac. This upgrade makes possible the acceleration of iron, cobalt, copper and krypton ions in the Nuclotron. Upgrades to both Laser and EBIS sources are also planned, to increase the linac output current and the atomic number of accelerated ions. 2...|$|E
40|$|A blade {{alignment}} {{mechanism for}} an ice skate including a clamp for releasably securing the blade assembly to a skating boot {{in a trial}} position. The clamp includes a first member secured to the boot at a point remote from the screw apertures in the <b>front</b> or rear <b>flanges,</b> and a second member attached to the first member and disposed to contact one of the flanges {{to hold it in}} a trial position. The second member includes an enlarged adjustment opening that allows side-to-side and fore-and-aft adjustment of the second member with respect to the first member. The first and second members are locked into the selected trial position by tightening a threaded fastener that draws contacting serrated faces of the first and second members together. Thus, the blade assembly is releasably attached to the boot in a trial position for trial use by the skater...|$|R
50|$|The Do 217 was a shoulder-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane. Its two-spar wing {{was built}} in three sections: the centre section, incorporating part of the fuselage, and two outer wing sections with very little taper on the leading and trailing edges, leading out {{to a pair of}} broad, semi-circular wing tips. The stress bearing skin was riveted to spars and ribs. Owing to its future use as a dive-bomber, stressed skin construction was employed with the use of Z-section frames and stringers. Slotted ailerons were fitted to the outer wing sections. The inner split flaps were electrically operated and had a maximum flap angle of 55°. The ailerons were linked to the flap system to permit partial operation as flaperons, meaning if the flaps were lowered the ailerons drooped down.The design of the rear and front spar attachments revealed the flanges of the spar were flushed with the wing surface making the most efficient structure. The outer wing leading edges were double-skinned. In the wing space, a hot air feed was fitted, using heat pumped through lagged pipes from the engines to warm up and de-ice the wings. The ducts were located just forward of the <b>front</b> spar <b>flanges</b> and in between the main spars where they could escape into the wing. The hot air could escape through the apertures at the aileron hinges. A diversion pipe was also installed in the engine nacelle, which could shut down the hot air flow to the ducts and divert the air out through bottom end of the nacelle if de-icing was not required.The fuel and oil tanks were located in the wing and centre section. The two outer fuel tanks were located next to the outer side of the engine nacelle. The outermost fuel tank contained a 160 L fuel capacity, while the tank closest to the engine could accommodate 44 imp gal of oil. Both were sandwiched in between the main and rear main spar. Between the fuselage and inner side of the engine nacelle, the 795 L main tanks were located. In the centre section a 1050 L fuel tank was installed forward of the bomb bay.|$|R

40|$|Flight-by-flight {{fatigue tests}} {{were carried out}} on {{specimens}} representing part of the <b>front</b> <b>flange</b> of the main spar of the Mirage III wing. Two loading spectra/loading sequences were used, the first being a 200 -flight sequence incorporating 24 different types of flight developed by the Eidgenopsisches Flugzeugwerk in Switzerland and the second a much simplified 100 -flight sequence incorporating only 4 different types of flight developed by Avions Marcel Dassault in France. The fatigue tests showed {{that there were no}} significant differences in the lives to failure between specimens tested under the two sequences, and it was therefore concluded that the use of the simplified stress spectrum/sequence would not have invalidated the findings of a previous investigation to develop life-enhancemen...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} {{thermal protection}} system (TPS) for a spacecraft includes a grid that is bonded to {{skin of the}} spacecraft, e. g., to support the structural loads of the spacecraft. A plurality of thermally insulative, relatively large panels are positioned on the grid to cover {{the skin of the}} spacecraft to which the grid has been bonded. Each panel includes a rounded front edge and a <b>front</b> <b>flange</b> depending downwardly from the front edge. Also, each panel includes a rear edge formed with a rounded socket for receiving the rounded front edge of another panel therein, and a respective rear flange depends downwardly from each rear edge. Pins are formed on the front flanges, and pin receptacles are formed on the rear flanges, such that the pins of a panel mechanically interlock with the receptacles of the immediately forward panel.

40|$|In {{present report}} {{operational}} principle {{and construction of}} the multiple view lines neutral particle analyzer for hydrogen atoms is described. The analyzer is built according to the pin-hole camera scheme. The same approach has already been used for space studies [1, 2]. Our instrument fulfils some specific requirements for the magnetically confined plasma diagnostics. The analyzer is designed to measure spatial distribution of fast charge-exchange atoms emitted by high temperature plasma. The dispersion system of the analyzer {{is based on the}} electrostatic analysis. Hydrogen atoms stripping may be performed both in the gas cell containing molecular hydrogen and in the thin carbon foil. The analyzer was calibrated for both targets. Data on absolute efficiency and energy resolution as a function of energy are presented.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{contract}} was to provide optomechanical engineering and fabrication support to the Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) program {{in the areas of}} mirror, optical bench and camera assemblies of the telescope. The Center for Applied Optics (CAO) worked closely with the Optics and S&E technical staff of MSFC to develop and investigate the most viable and economical options for the design and fabrication of a number of parts for the various telescope assemblies. All the tasks under this delivery order have been successfully completed within budget and schedule. A number of development hardware parts have been designed and fabricated jointly by MSFC and UAH for the engineering model of SXI. The major parts include a nickel electroformed mirror and a mirror mount, plating and coating of the ceramic spacers, and gold plating of the contact rings and fingers for the camera assembly. An aluminum model of the high accuracy sun sensor (HASS) was also designed and fabricated. A number of fiber optic tapers for the camera assembly were also coated with indium tin oxide and phosphor for testing and evaluation by MSFC. A large number of the SXI optical bench parts were also redesigned and simplified for a prototype telescope. These parts include the forward and rear support <b>flanges,</b> <b>front</b> aperture plate, the graphite epoxy optical bench and a test fixture for the prototype telescope. More than fifty (50) drawings were generated for various components of the prototype telescope. Some of these parts were subsequently fabricated at UAH machine shop or at MSFC or by the outside contractors. UAH also provide technical support to MSFC staff for a number of preliminary and critical design reviews. These design reviews included PDR and CDR for the mirror assembly by United Technologies Optical Systems (UTOS), and the program quarterly reviews, and SXI PDR and CDR. UAH staff also regularly attended the monthly status reviews, and made a significant number of suggestions to improve the design, assembly and alignment of the telescope. Finally, a high level assembly and alignment plan for the entire telescope was prepared by UAH. This plan addresses the sequence of assembly, the required assembly and alignment tolerances, and the methods to verify the alignment at each step during the assembly process. This assembly and alignment plan will be used to assemble and integrate the engineering model (EM) of the telescope. Later on, based on this plan more detailed assembly and alignment procedures will be developed for the lower-level assemblies of SXI...|$|R
40|$|A {{relatively}} high solidification rate {{as well as}} the chemical modification of molten metal {{play a key role in}} Aluminium foundry, influencing the microstructural scale and the morphology and distribution of eutectic silicon. In this work, the effects of the solidification conditions and the strontium (Sr) addition on the modification level of eutectic silicon have been analysed in three different AlSiMg(Ti) foundry alloys. The same alloys have been modified by sodium (Na) addition and the results compared. The modification level has been studied by means of thermal analysis and subsequent metallographic examination of the solid samples. Different arrangements have been set up in thermal analysis experiments to change the cooling rate during solidification. At low solidification rate, the EN AB- 42000 (AlSi 7 MgTi) alloy shows a continuous improvement of the modification level with increasing Sr content and the optimum is reached in a range of 100 - 200 ppm Sr. The EN AB- 43300 (AlSi 9 MgTi) and 44000 (AlSi 11 MgTi) alloys, with higher silicon content, do not present similar results, showing a partially modified microstructure, although a higher Sr amount has been added. Further, specimens with the highest Sr additions show the presence of particles Al 2 Si 2 Sr type, which do not contribute to the modifying effect. These intermetallics are located in the zones where the eutectic silicon is weakly modified. On the contrary, all the analysed alloys show a good modification level after Na addition. The eutectic depression is higher than 7 °C and the metallographic investigation confirms a well modified microstructure with a fine and fibrous silicon eutectic. No recalescence effect is evaluated after Na addition. The modification level of the EN AB- 43300 and 44000 alloys, after chemical modification with Sr, significantly improves with increasing solidification rate, as confirmed by the reduction of the eutectic growth temperature. The microstructural analysis shows the combined effect of the elevated heat transfer rate and chemical modification on the improvement of silicon morphology and size. After a first test step based on a thermal analysis approach, the study has turned to gravity cast wheels, where several solidification conditions are present. The preliminary results support the microstructural analysis carried out on cast wheels. The EN AB- 42000 e 44000 alloys have been used. A batch of castings has been modified with Sr and another one with Na. The wheels, cast with the EN AB- 42000 alloy and modified with 200 ppm Sr or 50 ppm Na, show a well modified microstructure both in the hub and in the <b>front</b> <b>flange.</b> In spite the different cooling conditions of the analysed regions, the modification level is good and the eutectic silicon is fine and fibrous. The wheels, cast with the EN AB- 44000 alloy and modified with 400 ppm Sr, show a coarser microstructure, with eutectic islands of unmodified silicon in the hub. At the same time, the <b>front</b> <b>flange</b> presents a well modified microstructure. The cast wheels, modified with 50 ppm Na, show a fibrous microstructure with very few eutectic islands of unmodified eutectic silicon in the hub, and a well modified microstructure in the <b>front</b> <b>flange.</b> Therefore, while a high solidification rate is not needed in an aluminium alloy with low silicon content, this seems to be required for alloys with higher amount of silicon. The consequences are important for real shaped castings where different solidification conditions are present, due to different heat transfer rates. Controlling the heat transfer and the type and amount of chemical modifier, it is possible to obtain, to a large degree, an homogeneous microstructure and an improvement in the final quality of castings...|$|E
