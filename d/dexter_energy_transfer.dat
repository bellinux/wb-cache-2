The preparation of Ln[sup] 3 + doped rutile SnO[sub] 2 (Ln = Sm, Eu, Tb, Ho, Nd) by a sol-gel method is described. Average particle size was found to be 23 nm by x-ray powder diffraction and electron microscopy. Factors affecting growth kinetics are also discussed. Successful sensitisation of Ln[sup] 3 + emission via SnO[sub] 2 host <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> is reported. Optimum Ln[su] 3 + concentrations were investigated and a proposed mechanism of <b>Dexter</b> type <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> based on SnO[sub] 2 lattice defects acting as sensitising centres is presented. The relationship between the Ln ionic radius and the dopant concentration required to maximise its emission is also explored. It was found that the larger the ionic radii, the less Ln[sup] 3 + was required to maximise its emission. Investigations into the distance dependence of the <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> between Ln[su] 3 + and Sn[sup] 4 + as well as between neighbouring Ln[su] 3 + ions have been undertaken - e. g. it was concluded that maximum Sm[sup] 3 + sensitisation occurred when every fourth Sn ion was substituted by Sm. Poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) was synthesised via the thermal conversion route proposed by Wessling and Zimmerman. Monomers, precursor polymer and polymer were fully characterized by means of infra-red, UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy. By-products were also characterised by [sup] 1 H and [sup] 3 C-NMR. Incorporation of the SnO 2 :Ln[sup] 3 + nanocomposites into PPV was followed by extensive photoluminescent studies. It was found that sensitisation of both polymer and lanthanide was dependent on the system composition and concentration ratios. There was clear evidence to support successful harvesting of PPV non-emissive triplet state energy into useful Ln[sup] 3 + photon emission. To better benefit from triplet state population, a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) two-dimensional hydrogen-bonded cage was used to reduce the triplet quenching. A proposed mechanism of <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> is described for each system. Finally, poly(2, 5 -bis(3 -sulfonatoproproxy) - 1, 4 -phenylene, disodium salt-alt- 1, 4 -phenylene) (PPP-OPSO[sub] 3) was used as a donor, to systematically compare the effect of SnO[sub] 2 :Ln[sup] 3 + nanoparticles on the luminescence of a polymer with a larger band gap and higher triplet state energy. It was established that the high triplet state of PPP-OPSO[sub] 3 matched the emissive levels of most lanthanides, and a clear indication of triplet harvesting by Eu[sup] 3 + was obtained under oxygen-free conditions in a PVA amtrix. Exchange of the polymer's Nasup]+ cation by Eu[sup] 3 + brought both donor and acceptor into close proximity. <b>Dexter</b> type <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> was seen from both singlet and triplet states, with Eu[sup] 3 + emission lifetimes as long as 400 ms in phosphorescence measurements...|$|R

Red- emitting phosphorescent iridium complexes based on the [Ir(btp) 2 (acac) ]fragment (where btp is 2 -(2 '-benzo[b]thienyl) pyridinato and acac is acetylacetonate) have been attached either directly (spacerless) or through a -(CH 2) (8) -chain (octamethylene-tethered) at the 9 -position of a 9 -octylfluorene host. The resulting dibromo-functionalized spacerless (8) or octamethylene-tethered (12) fluorene monomers were chain extended by Suzuki polycondensations using the bis(boronate) -terminated fluorene macromonomers 16 {{in the presence of}} end-capping chlorobenzene solvent to produce the statistical spacerless (17) and octamethylene-tethered (18) copolymers containing an even dispersion of the pendant phosphorescent fragments. The spacerless monomer 12 adopts a face-to-face conformation with a separation of only 3. 6 angstrom between the iridium complex and fluorenyl group, as shown by X-ray analysis of a single crystal, and this facilitates intramolecular triplet <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> in the spacerless copolymers 17. The photo- and electroluminescence efficiencies of the octamethylene-tethered copolymers 18 are double those of the spacerless copolymers 17, and this is consistent with suppression of the back transfer of triplets from the red phosphorescent iridium complex to the polyfluorene backbone in 18. The incorporation of a -(CH 2) (8) - chain between the polymer host and phosphorescent guest is thus an important design principle for achieving higher efficiencies in those electrophosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes for which the triplet energy levels of the host and guest are similar...|$|R

40|$|Noncoherent photon {{upconversion}} (NCPU) {{realized by}} means of triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) is of significant recent interest because {{of the possibility of}} using this phenomenon for increasing the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Efficiencies can be achieved if the near-IR parts of the solar spectrum can be absorbed and used in TTA. However, realizing this potential is not trivial. Dual absorption and TTA usually populates a higher excited singlet state (Sn, n ≥ 2) of the absorber molecule and the fate of this state can be a critical factor controlling efficiencies and hence the potential efficiency improvements in DSSCs. With a motivation to understand the photophysical processes that decides the fate of the product state of TTA, the role of the S 2 state of a metalloporphyrin and a fullerene in solution-phase NCPU has been investigated using photophysical techniques. TTA in the model porphyrin, zinc(II) meso-tetraphenylporphine (ZnTPP) realized by excitation with a green laser, was found to occur through a short-range Dexter-type <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> mechanism. It was also found, contrary to a previous suggestion, that a Förster-type <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> cannot occur from the short-lived S 2 state of ZnTPP to an acceptor molecule. It was hypothesized that prior aggregation of ZnTPP and the acceptor molecule should exist to enable such an <b>energy</b> <b>transfer.</b> For blue emitter (BE) molecules with triplet energies lower than that of ZnTPP, a triplet-triplet <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> (TTET) from ZnTPP to the BE followed by TTA in the BE populates its S 1 state. However, this is not possible for BEs with triplet energies significantly greater than that of ZnTPP. In this case, it is proposed that the triplet ZnTPP forms a triplet exciplex with a ground state BE. The triplet exciplex then annihilates with a second triplet ZnTPP to form the S 1 state of the BE. For the studies of the NCPU in C 60, the BEs chosen were having triplet energies similar or slightly lower than that of C 60. The NCPU in these systems follows the well-established mechanism of TTET from C 60 to the BE followed by TTA in the BE to produce its S 1 state. However, for systems in which the triplet energies of C 60 and BE are similar, the NCPU process is controlled by entropic factors which in turn can be controlled by the concentration of the BE. Compared to this system, NCPU in a system in which the triplet of C 60 lies slightly higher than that of the BE was found to be more efficient. The involvement of the higher excited singlet states of C 60 (Sn, n ≥ 2) can be considered as insignificant because of the proximity of these states to the S 1 state and the large rates of internal conversion from these states to the S 1 state. Because triplets can be quenched by molecular oxygen, the rate of oxygen diffusion in devices based on NCPU needs to be evaluated. With this objective, upconverted S 2 emission from ZnTPP produced by TTA was used as a tool to measure the rate of oxygen diffusion in a thin polymer film. It was found that the oxygen permeability is controlled by the characteristics of the polymer matrix, including its water content and its distribution. C 60 has been evaluated as a possible electron acceptor for the TTA-produced S 2 state of ZnTPP. Quenching of the S 2 and S 1 fluorescence of ZnTPP by added C 60, with more efficient quenching for the Soret-excited ZnTPP+C 60 species, was demonstrated. Significant ground state aggregation between ZnTPP and C 60 was proven. However this factor could not account for the observed difference in the rates of quenching of the S 2 and S 1 fluorescence of the excited porphyrin. The difference in the rates of quenching was attributed to differences in the free <b>energies</b> of electron <b>transfer</b> from the S 2 and S 1 states of ZnTPP to C 60. Conclusive evidence for this was obtained from transient absorption studies carried out at the University of Melbourne, which demonstrated the formation of a long-lived charge transfer state upon Soret-excitation of the porphyrin-C 60 complex. However, the involvement of short-range <b>Dexter</b> type <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> could not be ruled out in this system...|$|R

To keep fossil fuel usage in 2040 even with 2010 usage, 50 % of global energy {{will need to}} come from alternative sources such as solar cells. While the photovoltaic market is currently dominated by crystalline silicon, there are many low-cost solar cell materials such as conjugated polymers, semiconductor nanocrystals, and organic small molecules which could compete with fossil fuels. To create cost-competitive devices, understanding the excited state dynamics of these materials is necessary. The first section of this thesis looks at aggregation in poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) which is commonly used in organic photovoltaics. The amount of aggregation in P 3 HT thin films was controlled by using a mixture of regioregular and regiorandom P 3 HT. Even with few aggregates present, excited states were found to transfer from amorphous to aggregate domains in < 50 fs which could indicate efficient long-range energy transfer. To further study P 3 HT aggregation, a triblock consisting of two P 3 HT chains with a coil polymer between them was investigated. By changing solvents, aggregation was induced in a stable and reversible manner allowing for spectroscopic studies of P 3 HT aggregates in solution. The polarity of the solvent was adjusted, and no change in excited state dynamics was observed implying the excited state has little charge-transfer character. Next, the conduction band density of states for copper zinc tin sulfide nanocrystals (CZTS NCs) was measured using pump-probe spectroscopy and found to be in agreement with theoretical results. The density of states shifted and dilated for smaller NCs indicative of quantum confinement. The excited state lifetime {{was found to be}} short (< 20 ps) and independent of NC size which could limit the efficiency of CZTS photovoltaic devices. Finally, triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) was studied in platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) thin films. By analyzing pump-probe spectra, the product of TTA in PtOEP thin films was assigned to a long-lived metal-centered state. To elucidate the mechanism of TTA, the annihilation dynamics were modeled using second order kinetics as well as Förster and <b>Dexter</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfer.</b> <b>Dexter</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> provided the best fits and the most reasonable fitting parameters...|$|E

The complex concentration driven change in lifetimes of QDs and stronger PL quenching than predicted solely by TRPL data indicate that the quenching is neither purely static nor purely dynamic in nature. Further, the absence of any ground state complex absorption feature suggests that the static quenching contribution is due to the close proximity of the QDs fluorophores and deactivating sites of complexes. The dynamic quenching processes like diffusion mediated collisional quenching, <b>Dexter</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfer,</b> and hole transfer have been methodically ruled out, leaving Forster resonant energy transfer (FRET) and the electron transfer (eT) between the QDs and complexes as the possible mechanisms.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} for triplet energy transfer from the green-emitting fac-tris[2 -(4 '-tert-butylphenyl) pyridinato]iridium (Ir(tBu-ppy) 3) complex to the red-emitting bis[2 -(2 '-benzothienyl) pyridinato-N,C 3 ') (acetylacetonato) iridium (Ir(btp) 2 (acac)) phosphor {{has been investigated}} using steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. [2, 2 '; 5,' 2 ' ']Terthiophene (3 T) was also used as triplet energy acceptor to differentiate between the two common mechanisms for energy transfer, i. e., the direct exchange of electrons (Dexter transfer) or the coupling of transition dipoles (Förster transfer). Unlike Ir(btp) 2 (acac), 3 T can only be active in <b>Dexter</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> {{because it has a}} negligible ground state absorption to the 3 (-*) state. The experiments demonstrate that in semidilute solution, the 3 MLCT state of Ir(tBu-ppy) 3 can transfer its triplet energy to the lower-lying 3 (-*) states of both Ir(btp) 2 (acac) and 3 T. For both acceptors, this transfer occurs via a diffusion-controlled reaction with a common rate constant (ken = 3. 8 × 109 L mol- 1 s- 1). In a solid-state polymer matrix, the two acceptors, however, show entirely different behavior. The 3 MLCT phosphorescence of Ir(tBu-ppy) 3 is strongly quenched by Ir(btp) 2 (acac) but not by 3 T. This reveals that under conditions where molecular diffusion is inhibited, triplet energy transfer only occurs via the Förster mechanism, provided that the transition dipole moments involved on energy donor and acceptor are not negligible. With the use of the Förster radius for triplet energy transfer from Ir(tBu-ppy) 3 to Ir(btp) 2 (acac) of R 0 = 3. 02 nm, the experimentally observed quenching is found to agree quantitatively with a model for Förster energy transfer that assumes a random distribution of acceptors in a rigid matrix...|$|E
40|$|Studies of the triplet {{excitons}} in polyspirobifluorene {{have been}} carried out principally the techniques of photo induced absorption and gated emission. Specifically the nature of the origin of the delayed emission has been investigated. In dilute solutions delayed fluorescence is attributed to intrachain triplet-triplet annihilation, whereas in thin films the delayed fluorescence is shown to originate from both inter and intra chain annihilation processes. In dilute solutions the use of time resolved photo induced absorption has proven the production of triplets via intersystem crossing. In addition in dilute solutions the observation of triplet-triplet annihilation in the absence of singlet-singlet annihilation has shown that the singlet excitons are relatively immobile along the chains compared with the triplet excitons. In addition to the triplet studies of PSBF, investigations were made into oligomers of the polyfluorene derivative Pf 2 / 6. Absorption and photo induced absorption {{studies have shown that the}} triplet exciton is intrinsically confined to approximately 5 repeat units of the polymer, whereas the singlet occupies a considerably larger conjugation length of approximately 25 units. In another derivative, PFO the effect of the presence of the P-phase on the photo induced absorption spectra has been investigated for both poor solvents and in films. Principally a shifted photoinduced absorption spectrum is observed along with the features for the amorphous polymer, in addition the low luminescence of the P-phase allows a higher transition of the triplet to be observed. Finally we have shown that it is possible to manipulate the rate of guest host triplet back transfer between the phosphor and the polymer host in an organic phosphor doped polymer system by exploiting the short range nature of <b>Dexter</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfer.</b> Derivatives of Ir(PPY) 3 with bulky side groups were shown to have a reduced rate of back transfer in comparison to the unsubstituted Ir(PPY) 3 complex...|$|E
3000|$|A {{crucial feature}} of {{preparing}} the latter kind of hybrid WOLED {{is the use}} of an interlayer (IL), located between the blue F emitter and complementary P emitter, which can (1) prevent the Förster energy transfer from F blue emitters to red–green/orange P emitters, (2) eliminate the <b>Dexter</b> <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> from red–green/orange P emitters to F blue emitters, (3) tune the emission colors, and (4) prolong the lifetime [11, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. In fact, a large number of materials have been used as effective ILs to realize hybrid WOLEDs, such as the most widely used 4, 4 -N,N-dicarbazolebiphenyl (CBP) [11, 22, 23, 24], 4, 4 ′, 4 ″-tri(9 -carbazoyl) triphenylamine (TCTA): 2, 2 ′, 2 ″-(1, 3, 5 -benzinetriyl)-tris(1 -phenyl- 1 -H-benzimidazole) (TPBi) used by Leo group [25, 26], and bis[2 -(2 -hydroxyphenyl)-pyridine] beryllium (Bepp 2) (TCTA) [27, 28], N,N′-di(naphthalene- 1 -yl)-N,N′-diphenyl-benzidine (NPB) [29, 30] and 1 -bis[4 -[N,N-di(4 -tolyl)amino]phenyl]-cyclohexane (TAPC) used by Ma group [31]. It is noted that most publications are focused on bipolar or p-type ILs; however, only a negligible amount of attention has been given to n-type ILs. As a result, the performance (i.e., efficiency, CRI, and driving voltage) of hybrid WOLEDs with n-type ILs lags far behind their counterparts [32, 33, 34]. For instance, maximum power efficiencies (PEs) of only 18.8, 3.0, and 20.9  lm W− 1 have been obtained in Ho’s [32], Xia’s [33], and our [34] hybrid WOLEDs with the n-type IL, respectively. In addition, the introduction of n-type ILs to regulate charges and excitons, which helps to boost performance, is not well understood. Moreover, the comparison of bipolar, p-type, and n-type ILs, which can be very helpful in understanding the role of ILs in hybrid WOLEDs, is not clear. Therefore, is it possible to further enhance the performance of hybrid WOLEDs with n-type ILs? [...]...|$|E

We consider both radiative (mediated by real photons) and non-radiative (mediated by virtual photons) mechanisms of <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> using a unified Green's function approach {{that takes into account}} modification of the exciton energy dispersions as a result of interactions. The large optical oscillator strengths associated with excitons in TMDs result in very fast <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> rates. The <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> times depend on the exciton momentum, exciton linewidth, and the interlayer separation and can range from values less than 100 femtoseconds to more than tens of picoseconds. Whereas inside the light cone the <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> rates of longitudinal and transverse excitons are comparable, outside the light cone the <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> rates of longitudinal excitons far exceed those of transverse excitons. Average <b>energy</b> <b>transfer</b> times for a thermal ensemble of longitudinal and transverse excitons is temperature dependent and can be smaller than a picosecond at room temperature for interlayer separations smaller than 10 nm. <b>Energy</b> <b>transfer</b> times of localized excitons range from values less than a picosecond to several tens of picoseconds.
