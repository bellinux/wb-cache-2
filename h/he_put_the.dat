5|$|In the 85thminute, Scholes clipped {{the ball}} {{over the top of}} the Barcelona {{defensive}} line to Rooney, who chested the ball down for Tevez, only to be given offside. Scholes then found Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to get back and put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just beyond the reach of Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> ball high over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|While Cope and Marsh dueled for fossils in the American West, {{they also}} tried {{their best to}} ruin each other's {{professional}} credibility. Humiliated by his error in reconstructing the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus, Cope tried to cover up his mistake by purchasing every copy he could find of the journal {{in which it was}} published. Marsh, meanwhile, made sure to publicize the story. Cope's own rapid and prodigious output of scientific papers meant that Marsh had no difficulty in finding occasional errors with which to lambast Cope. Marsh himself was not infallible; <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> wrong skull on a skeleton of Apatosaurus and declared it a new genus, Brontosaurus.|$|E

5|$|A second prototype, {{completed}} {{near the}} end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had set out to do, was boring. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means to reset the avatar if this should happen, and the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the excitement of the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player could drop an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.|$|E
5|$|Costello {{picks up}} the trenchcoat and shoots more {{subordinates}} who get in his way. Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with the woman and children.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham had one serious {{accident}} whilst flying. On 20 November 1975 at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey, {{a flock of}} Snowy plover birds collided with the British Aerospace BAe 125 aircraft just after takeoff and were ingested by the engines. Cunningham was forced to make an emergency landing. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> aircraft down at , onto the runway, but it careered through {{the perimeter of the}} airfield and across a public road where it collided with a car carrying four passengers who were killed; no-one died on board the HS-125. Cunningham suffered two crushed vertebra but he remained chief test pilot at Hawker Siddeley after the accident until 1978 when British Aerospace was formed. He was awarded the Segrave Trophy for his services in 1978. In recognition of his wartime exploits and his contribution to civil aviation, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and retired from British aerospace in 1980.|$|E

5|$|Henry's chief minister, Hubert de Burgh {{fell from}} power in 1232. His old rival, Peter des Roches, {{returned}} to England from the crusades in August 1231 and allied himself with Hubert's {{growing number of}} political opponents. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> case to Henry that the Justiciar had squandered royal money and lands, and was responsible {{for a series of}} riots against foreign clerics. Hubert took sanctuary in Merton College Chapel, but Henry had him arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Des Roches took over the King's government, backed by the Poitevin baronial faction in England, who saw this as a chance to take back the lands which they had lost to Hubert's followers in the previous decades.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{cast the}} actors by {{approaching}} customers {{at a local}} gas station whenever he saw somebody that looked like they fit one of the parts. He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment. For the creature itself, he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be more frightening if the creature was left to the viewer's imagination. Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> reel {{into the trunk of}} his car and drove to Los Angeles seeking post-production services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, who owned a small post-production company and agreed to work on the film for limited up-front pay and {{a small percentage of the}} film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film. He cleaned the property himself to prepare for the debut.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine Fencing Committee {{had great}} {{difficulty}} in organizing {{a team to}} attend the 1924 Summer Olympics. Despite {{the establishment of the}} Argentine Olympic Committee, and his participation and success in all of the trials, Camet did not attend a congratulatory gala for the Olympic delegation, nor did he travel to Paris to participate in the games themselves, for personal reasons. The official report lists him {{as a member of the}} official delegation, albeit one who did not participate. That year, the Argentines placed fifth in the team foil competition. He continued to practice fencing until 1926 when, after winning a national championship, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> sport on hold to complete his law degree.|$|E

He decided, more as a hobby than a job, {{to put it on}} public display in Reykjavík and was awarded a grant from the city council of ISK 200,000 to support the opening of a museum in August 1997. By 2003, it was attracting 5,200 visitors a year, of which 4,200 were from abroad. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> museum up for sale in 2003, but also offered it to the city of Reykjavík as a gift. However, he was unsuccessful in obtaining financial support from the state or city. When he retired in 2004, he could no longer afford the rent on the museum's premises.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He {{passed through the}} dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E
5|$|Well {{before the}} American victory at Buena Vista, {{political}} clubs were formed which supported Taylor for President. His support {{was drawn from}} an unusually broad assortment of political bands, including Whigs and Democrats, Northerners and Southerners, allies and opponents of national leaders such as Henry Clay and James K. Polk. By late 1846 Taylor's opposition to a presidential run began to weaken, and {{it became clear that}} his principles more closely resembled Whig orthodoxy. Still, he maintained that he would only accept election as a national, independent figure, rather than a partisan loyalist. Taylor declared, as the 1848 Whig Party convention approached, that he had always been a Whig in principle, but he did consider himself a Jeffersonian-Democrat. Many southerners believed that Taylor supported slavery and its expansion into the new territory absorbed from Mexico, and some were angered when Taylor suggested that if he were elected President he would not veto the Wilmot Proviso, which proposed against such an expansion. This position did not enhance his support from activist antislavery elements in the Northern U.S., as these wanted Taylor to speak out strongly in support of the Proviso, not simply fail to veto it. Most abolitionists did not support Taylor, since he was a slave-owner. Many southerners also knew that Taylor supported states' rights and was opposed to protective tariffs and government spending for internal improvements. The Whigs hoped that <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> federal union of the United States above all else.|$|E
