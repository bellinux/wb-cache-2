40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} the mouse inorganic phosphate transporter Npt 1 operates in the hepatic sinusoidal membrane transport of anionic drugs such as benzylpenicillin and mevalonic acid. In the present study, the mechanism of renal secretion of penem antibiotics was examined by using a Xenopus oocyte expression system. <b>Faropenem</b> (an oral penem antibiotic) was transported via Npt 1 with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 0. 77 ± 0. 34 mM in a sodium-independent but chloride ion-sensitive manner. When the concentration of chloride ions was increased, the transport activity of <b>faropenem</b> by Npt 1 was decreased. Since the concentration gradient of chloride ions is in the lumen-to-intracellular direction, <b>faropenem</b> {{is expected to be}} transported from inside proximal tubular cells to the lumen. So, we tested the release of <b>faropenem</b> from Xenopus oocytes. The rate of efflux of <b>faropenem</b> from Npt 1 -expressing oocytes was about 9. 5 times faster than that from control water-injected Xenopus oocytes. <b>Faropenem</b> transport by Npt 1 was significantly inhibited by β-lactam antibiotics such as benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefazolin to 24. 9, 40. 5, 54. 4, and 26. 2 % of that for the control, respectively. Zwitterionic β-lactam antibiotics showed lesser inhibitory effects on <b>faropenem</b> uptake than anionic derivatives, indicating that Npt 1 preferentially transports anionic compounds. Other anionic compounds, such as indomethacin and furosemide, and the anion transport inhibitor 4, 4 ′-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid significantly inhibited <b>faropenem</b> uptake mediated by Npt 1.

Of the 176 strains of Bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had <b>faropenem</b> MICs of 64 μg/ml and imipenem MICs of > 32 μg/ml. <b>Faropenem</b> had an MIC of 16 μg/ml for an additional isolate of B. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (MIC of 1 μg/ml). Both <b>faropenem</b> and imipenem had MICs of ≤ 4 μg/ml for all isolates of Bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), Bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), Bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), Bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), Porphyromonas species (42 isolates), Prevotella species (78 isolates), Campylobacter species (25 isolates), Sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), Fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other Fusobacterium species (9 isolates). <b>Faropenem</b> and imipenem had MICs of 16 to 32 μg/ml for two strains of Clostridium difficile; the MICs for all other strains of Clostridium tested (69 isolates) were ≤ 4 μg/ml. <b>Faropenem</b> had MICs of 8 and 16 μg/ml, respectively, for two strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (MICs of imipenem were 2 μg/ml).

In this study we evaluated the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) relationships between the plasma <b>faropenem</b> free-drug (f) concentrations and efficacy against B. anthracis in a murine postexposure prophylaxis inhalation model. The plasma PKs and PKs-PDs of <b>faropenem</b> were evaluated in BALB/c mice following the intraperitoneal (i. p.) administration of doses ranging from 2. 5 to 160 mg/kg of body weight. For the evaluation of efficacy, mice received by inhalation aerosol doses of B. anthracis (Ames strain; <b>faropenem</b> MIC, 0. 06 μg/ml) at 100 times the 50 % lethal dose. The <b>faropenem</b> dosing regimens (10, 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg/day) were administered i. p. at 24 h postchallenge at 4 -, 6 -, and 12 -h intervals for 14 days. The sigmoid maximum-threshold-of-efficacy (Emax) model fit the survival data, in which the free-drug area under the concentration-time curve (fAUC) /MIC ratio, the maximum concentration of free drug in plasma (fCmax) /MIC ratio, and the cumulative percentage of a 24 -h period that the free-drug concentration exceeds the MIC under steady-state pharmacokinetic conditions (f %TMIC) were each evaluated. Assessment of f %TMIC demonstrated the strongest correlation with survival (R 2 = 0. 967) compared to the correlations achieved by assessment of fAUC/MIC or fCmax/MIC, for which minimal correlations were observed.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the ability of a disc susceptibility test using <b>faropenem</b> (10 g) to predict carbapenemase activity in Enterobacteriaceae. A collection of 166 isolates of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) and 82 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae that produced other-lactamases was compiled from diverse sources. Disc susceptibility testing was per-formed using the CLSI/EUCASTmethodology with discs of <b>faropenem</b> (10 g), temocillin (30 g), and four carbapenems (each 10 g). A further prospective evaluation of the <b>faropenem</b> disc susceptibility test was performed using 205 consecutive isolates referred to a United Kingdom reference laboratory in parallel with molecular methods for carbapenemase detection. Of 166 iso-lates of CPE, 99 % showed growth up to the edge of a 10 -g <b>faropenem</b> disc compared with only 6 % of other -lactamase produc-ers (sensitivity, 99 %; specificity, 94 %). A “double zone ” around 10 -g <b>faropenem</b> discs was frequently associated with OXA- 48 producers. Of the carbapenems, the most useful agent was imipenem, where a zone diameter of < 23 mm as a predictor of car-bapenemase activity had a sensitivity of 99 % and a specificity of 85 %. The presence of no zone of inhibition around a 30 -g temocillin disc was a consistent feature of strains producing OXA- 48 carbapenemase. For 205 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae re-ferred to a United Kingdom reference laboratory, growth up to a 10 -g <b>faropenem</b> disc correctly identified 84 of 86 carbapen-emase producers (98 % sensitivity), with a specificity of 87 %.

40|$|Background: There is a {{need for}} new oral agents active against extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) producers, as these {{increasingly}} cause community-onset infections. We therefore evaluated <b>faropenem,</b> a penem in Phase III development, against recently collected oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant bacteria. Methods: We tested 847 consecutive cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae collected at 16 centres in South-East England in 2004, 501 of them with CTX-M enzymes; we also tested reference strains and transconjugants with acquired b-lactamases and various modes of AmpC expression. MICs were determined by the BSAC agar dilution method. Results: Modal MICs of <b>faropenem</b> for Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp. with CTX-M or non-CTX-M ESBLs or high-level AmpC enzyme were 0. 5 – 1 mg/L, with over 95 % of producers susceptible to 2 mg/L. Modal MICs for Enterobacter and Citrobacter spp. with ESBLs or derepressed AmpC were 2 – 4 mg/L, although around 5 % of AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter spp. required <b>faropenem</b> MICs of 16 mg/L. MICs of 8 – 16 mg/L were seen also for most AmpC-derepressed Serratia spp. isolates. Derepression of AmpC in isogenic mutant series typically raised <b>faropenem</b> MICs by one doubling dilution; among the b-lactamases introduced into E. coli, only NMC-A (Class A) and IMP (Class B) carbapenemases caused substantive rises in <b>faropenem</b> MICs. Conclusions: <b>Faropenem</b> has good activity against E. coli and Klebsiella spp. with ESBLs, including the CTX-M types now proliferating in Europe, but was less active against AmpC-derepressed and ESBL-producing Enterobacter spp. Its clinical utility will depend on levels achieved in the urinary tract, the site of most of the community infections caused by ESBL producers, and more work is needed in this area...|$|E
40|$|Surveillance studies {{conducted}} in the United States {{over the last decade}} have revealed increasing resistance among community-acquired respiratory pathogens, especially Streptococcus pneumoniae, that may limit future options for empirical therapy. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the scope and magnitude of the problem at the national and regional levels during the 2005 - 2006 respiratory season (the season when community-acquired respiratory pathogens are prevalent) in the United States. Also, since <b>faropenem</b> is an oral penem being developed for the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections, another study objective was to provide baseline data to benchmark changes in the susceptibility of U. S. respiratory pathogens to the drug in the future. The in vitro activities of <b>faropenem</b> and other agents were determined against 1, 543 S. pneumoniae isolates, 978 Haemophilus influenzae isolates, and 489 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates collected from 104 U. S. laboratories across six geographic regions during the 2005 - 2006 respiratory season. Among S. pneumoniae isolates, the rates of resistance to penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefdinir were 16, 6. 4, and 19. 2 %, respectively. The least effective agents were trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) and azithromycin, with resistance rates of 23. 5 and 34 %, respectively. Penicillin resistance rates for S. pneumoniae varied by region (from 8. 7 to 22. 5 %), as did multidrug resistance rates for S. pneumoniae (from 8. 8 to 24. 9 %). Resistance to β-lactams, azithromycin, and SXT was higher among S. pneumoniae isolates from children than those from adults. β-Lactamase production rates among H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates were 27. 4 and 91. 6 %, respectively. <b>Faropenem</b> MICs at which 90 % of isolates are inhibited were 0. 5 μg/ml for S. pneumoniae, 1 μg/ml for H. influenzae, and 0. 5 μg/ml for M. catarrhalis, suggesting that <b>faropenem</b> shows promise as a treatment option for respiratory infections caused by contemporary resistant phenotypes...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{exposure}} of Streptococcus pneumoniae to cell-wall-active antibiotics in vivo and in vitro {{results in the}} release of bacterial components that can induce proinflammatory activation of human cells via toll-like receptor 2 (TLR 2). The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the activation of human TLR 2 pathways after {{exposure of}} S. pneumoniae to <b>faropenem,</b> cefotaxime and vancomycin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Streptococcus pneumoniae D 39 was exposed to cefotaxime, <b>faropenem</b> or vancomycin for 6 h during lag or early log phase growth. IL- 8 promoter activity of HeLa cells was measured using a dual luciferase reporter plasmid system. HeLa cells were transfected with an expression vector containing TLR 2 /CD 14, or empty vector/CD 14 and IL- 8 promoter activity was measured using luminescence. Cells were stimulated with antibiotic-treated bacteria, untreated bacteria or medium-only controls. RESULTS: Lag phase S. pneumoniae treated at sub-MIC (1 / 8 MIC) cefotaxime or <b>faropenem</b> induced 11 -fold and 8 -fold increases, respectively, in TLR 2 -mediated IL- 8 promoter activity when compared with untreated bacteria. Early log MIC cefotaxime or faropenem-treated bacteria also enhanced TLR 2 activation by 3 -fold and 4 -fold, respectively, when compared with untreated bacteria.

40|$|International audienceOral {{cephalosporins}} and mecillinam {{are used}} to treat infections but are compromised by extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and plasmid AmpC β-lactamases. Potential solutions include combining an oral or intravenous cephalosporin with a β-lactamase inhibitor (BLI) or using an oral penem. These strategies were examined using transconjugants and clinical isolates with ESBLs or AmpC {{as a proxy for}} shigellae. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute agar dilution method was used with inocula of 10 and 10 colony-forming units/spot. ESBLs conferred resistance to the cephalosporins and mecillinam, at least at high inoculum, although: (i) ceftibuten was significantly compromised only by SHV and CTX-M- 15 ESBLs, but not by TEM or CTX-M- 9 and - 14; (ii) cefdinir was little affected by TEM-type ESBLs and mecillinam was little affected by CTX-M- 9 group enzymes. The BLI clavulanic acid reduced the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cephalosporins and mecillinam to ≤ 2 mg/L for ESBL-producers, even at high inocula; sulbactam in particular and tazobactam were less effective, especially against SHV types. Strains with AmpC were resistant to all cephalosporins±inhibitors, but mecillinam remained active (MIC= 1 mg/L) against a strain with AmpC alone, where strains with TEM- 1 +AmpC were susceptible to mecillinam+clavulanic acid at ≤ 2 mg/L. <b>Faropenem</b> was active against all ESBL- and AmpC-producers at 4 mg/L, with little inoculum effect or inhibitor potentiation. In conclusion, cephalosporin+clavulanic acid combinations overcame ESBLs, with ceftibuten+clavulanic acid being particularly promising. Mecillinam+clavulanic acid and <b>faropenem</b> overcame both ESBLs and AmpC enzymes.

In this study, {{in order to}} address the factors involved in the oral inactivity of meropenem, in vitro permeation characteristics across rat ileal segments was investigated using diffusion cells. Moreover, stability of meropenem was evaluated in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP) 1 st and 2 nd fluid for disintegration test. Cefotaxime, ceftibuten, and <b>faropenem</b> were used for comparison. The permeation of meropenem across rat ileal segments was approximately 5 -fold greater in secretory direction than in absorptive direction. The secretory-oriented transport of meropenem markedly diminished by replacement of D-glucose in the experimental medium with unmetabolizing 3 -O-methyl-D-glucose, suggesting that the secretory transport of meropenem was an energy-dependent process. Cefotaxime exhibited extensively secretory-oriented permeation. On the other hand, much weaker directionalities were observed in ceftibuten and <b>faropenem.</b> While meropenem as well as other three β-lactam antibiotics was stable in JP 2 nd fluid (pH 6. 8), it declined rapidly in JP 1 st fluid (pH 1. 2).

To investigate the mechanisms contributing to penem resistance, {{we used the}} laboratory strain PAO 1 to construct a series of isogenic mutants with an impaired multidrug efflux system MexAB-OprM and/or impaired chromosomal AmpC b-lactamase. The outer mem-brane barrier of PAO 1 was partially eliminated by inducing {{the expression of the}} plasmid-encoded Escherichia coli major porin OmpF. Susceptibility tests using the mutants and the OmpF expression plasmid showed that MexAB-OprM and the outer membrane barrier, but not AmpC b-lactamase, are the main mechanisms involved in the high intrinsic penem resistance of PAO 1. However, reducing the high intrinsic penem resistance of PAO 1 to the same level as that of penem-susceptible gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli required the loss of either both MexAB-OprM and AmpC b-lactamase or both MexAB-OprM and the outer membrane barrier.

The structure of LdtMt 2 was solved, a model of the three-domain protein located in the periplasm was proposed and the covalent adduct formation with β-lactam antibiotics was observed. The systematic analysis of several β-lactams identified <b>faropenem</b> displaying the fastest binding kinetics and resulting in the formation of a stable adduct. These results and the high-resolution structure of LdtMt 2 with this adduct representing the inactivated state describes the detailed action of <b>faropenem,</b> which is the most efficient β-lactam in killing M. tuberculosis in vitro and inside macrophages. During mycobacterial cell division, daughter cell separation requires endopeptidases from the NlpC/P 60 protein family. RipD the first non-catalytic member from this family that retains PG binding activity and carries a long penta-peptide repeat sequence in C-terminal position was characterized. RipA comprises a well-characterized C-terminal endopeptidase domain of the NlpC/P 60 -type and an N-terminal domain of unknown function. The N-terminal domain was previously implicated in inhibition of the catalytic activity by blocking the C-terminal domain. Here we show {{that it is not the}} N-terminal domain but the lid-module of the inter-domain linker that limits the active site access. The structure of the N-terminal domain was solved by X-ray crystallography revealing an elongated domain built by two long α-helices. Small angle X-ray scattering in combination with the X-ray structures of the two individual domains was used to model the periplasmic RipA protein suggesting a rigid, hairpin-like N-module connected to the catalytic domain by a flexible linker. This domain organization allows for a defined range of movement of the catalytic domain implicated the spatially controlled cell wall degradation...|$|E
40|$|L- 084 (a prodrug of LJC 11, 036 [L- 036]) {{is a new}} oral carbapenem. Here we {{compared}} the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of L- 036 with those of imipenem, <b>faropenem,</b> ceditoren-pivoxil, cefdinir, amoxicillin, and levofloxacin. The MICs at which 90 % of the isolates were inhibited of L- 036 against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant organisms, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae including ampicillin-resistant organisms, Legionella pneumophila, and Moraxella catarrhalis were equal to or less than 1 μg/ml. In pharmacokinetics studies of L- 084 in lungs of mice, the maximum concentration in serum, half-life, and area under the concentration-time curve of this drug were 9. 09 μg/g of tissue, 6. 18 h, and 31. 0 μg · h/ml, respectively. In murine respiratory infection models of penicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, the efficacies of L- 084 were better than those of reference drugs. Our {{results indicate that the}} in vitro high potency and good distribution in the lungs might be the underlying mechanisms of its efficacy in the murine model of pneumonia...|$|E
40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for the confirmatory and quantitative analysis of 30 β-lactam antibiotic residues in bovine muscle. The method includes 12 penicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, mecillinam, methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, penicillin G, penicillin V, piperacillin, ticarcillin), 12 cephalosporins (cefacetrile, cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefalonium, cefazolin, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, cefquinome, cefuroxime, desacetyl cephapirin, desfuroylceftiofur cysteine disulfide, desfuroylceftiofur dimer), five carbapenems (biapenem, doripenem, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem) and <b>faropenem.</b> Samples were extracted using a simple solvent extraction with acetonitrile:water (80 : 20, v/v) and C 18 dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) clean-up, followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) detection. Chromatography was performed on a reversed phase CSH C 18 column, using a binary gradient separation comprising of 0. 01 % formic acid and 0. 2 mM ammonium acetate in water (mobile phase A) and 0. 01 % formic acid in acetonitrile (mobile phase B). The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive electrospray ionisation mode (ESI(+)). Validation was performed following the 2002 / 657 /EC guidelines. Trueness ranged between 69 % and 143 % and precision ranged between 2. 0 % and 29. 9 % under within-laboratory reproducibility conditions. The developed method uses minimal sample preparation and 30 test samples can be analysed by a single analyst in a single day. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first method for carbapenems in foodstuff that does not require derivatisation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Olmesartan medoxomil (OM) is a prodrug type {{angiotensin}} II type 1 receptor antagonist widely prescribed as an antihypertensive agent. Herein, {{we describe}} the identification and characterization of the OM bioactivating enzyme that hydrolyzes the prodrug and converts to its pharmacologically active metabolite olmesartan in human liver and intestine. The protein was purified from human liver cytosol by successive column chromatography and was identified by mass spectrometry to be a carboxymethylenebutenolidase (CMBL) homolog. Human CMBL, whose endogenous function has still not been reported, is a human homolog of Pseudomonas dienelactone hydrolase involved in the bacterial halocatechol degradation pathway. The ubiquitous expression of human CMBL gene transcript in various tissues was observed. The recombinant human CMBL expressed in mammalian cells was clearly shown to activate OM. By comparing the enzyme kinetics and chemical inhibition properties between the recombinant protein and human tissue preparations, CMBL was demonstrated {{to be the primary}} OM bioactivating enzyme in the liver and intestine. The recombinant CMBL also converted other prodrugs having the same ester structure as OM, <b>faropenem</b> medoxomil and lenampicillin, to their active metabolites. CMBL exhibited a unique sensitivity to chemical inhibitors, thus, being distinguishable from other known esterases. Site-directed mutagenesis on the putative active residue Cys 132 of the recombinant CMBL caused a drastic reduction of the OM-hydrolyzing activity. We report {{for the first time that}} CMBL serves as a key enzyme in the bioactivation of OM, hydrolyzing the ester bond of the prodrug type xenobiotics...|$|E
