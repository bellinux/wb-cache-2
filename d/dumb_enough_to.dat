After being thrown off the case, Thompson requested that Judge Moore recuse himself from the case. Moore ignored him, stating [...] "I can’t consider it because he’s no longer practicing in the state of Alabama.

50|$|Most {{studies of}} {{historical}} smuggling {{have been based}} on official sources — such as court records, or the letters of Revenue Officers. According to Dr Evan Jones (University of Bristol), the trouble with these is that 'they only detail the activities of those <b>dumb</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> get caught'. This has led him and others, such as Prof Huw Bowen (University of Swansea) to use commercial records to reconstruct smuggling businesses. Jones' study focuses on smuggling in Bristol in the mid-16th century, arguing that the illicit export of goods like grain and leather represented {{a significant part of the}} city's business, with many members of the civic elite engaging in it. Grain smuggling by members of the civic elite, often working closely with corrupt customs officers, has also been shown to have been prevalent in East Anglia during the later 16th century.|$|E
