5|$|Freedom from Fear is {{the last}} of the {{well-known}} Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell. The series was based on the four goals known as the Four Freedoms, which were enunciated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union Address on January 6, 1941. This work was published in the March 13, 1943, issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by a prominent thinker of the day, Stephen Vincent Benét. The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into bed by their parents while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union Address on 23 January 2007, President Bush {{announced}} plans to deploy more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq in {{what became known as}} the Surge. Four thousand were specifically earmarked for Anbar, which Bush acknowledged had become both an AQI haven and a center of resistance against AQI. Instead of deploying new units, the Marine Corps chose to extend the deployments of several units already in Anbar: 1st Battalion 6th Marines, 3rd Battalion 4th Marines, and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). The 15th MEU would later be replaced by the 13th MEU as the last surge unit.|$|E
5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E

25|$|In January 2015 President Obama {{announced}} the NIH-led Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union address. Through advances in research, technology, {{and policies that}} empower patients, PMI will enable {{a new era of}} precision medicine long envisioned by Collins and many others in which researchers, providers, and patients work together to develop more individualized care. In fiscal year 2016, the first funding for the initiative was awarded, with $130 million allocated to NIH to build a national, large-scale research participant group, called a cohort, and $70 million allocated to NIH's National Cancer Institute as part of PMI for Oncology. The PMI Cohort Program will seek to extend precision medicine to all diseases by building a national research cohort of 1 million or more U.S. participants. In January 2016, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union address, President Obama called for a new initiative, to be led by Vice President Joe Biden, to galvanize the nation's research efforts against cancer. Fueled by an additional $680 million in the proposed fiscal year 2017 budget for NIH, the National Cancer Moonshot Initiative will aim to accelerate progress toward the next generation of interventions to reduce cancer incidence and improve patient outcomes.|$|E

Aquino announced steps to weed out tax evaders, and asked the Commission on Appointments to be easy on his Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|As governor, he {{also argued}} for limits on {{oil and gas}} {{drilling}} {{in order to protect}} the environment. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth address in January 2005, Romney said, “I'm concerned about the preservation of our natural resources. I will file legislation to protect our oceans from off shore drilling and commercial development. The oceans should not be up for grabs like some Wild West land rush.” He signed into law a bill to protect against oil spills and to increase penalties for polluters.|$|E

25|$|Claire relocates to Dallas {{and runs}} for Congress {{in her home}} district. The incumbent, Doris Jones, plans to retire and endorse her {{daughter}} Celia as her successor. Claire offers them federal funding for a key Planned Parenthood clinic in exchange for stepping down, but they refuse the offer. Frank wins back Claire's support by promising not to sabotage her campaign in Texas, but he later publicly endorses Celia <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union address. Frank and Claire travel to South Carolina for a primary, {{but a series of}} scandals causes Frank to narrowly lose the state to Dunbar. Frank discovers that Claire had been leaking information to Dunbar, and she threatens to continue unless he names her as his running mate. Frank refuses.|$|E
25|$|The {{president}} inaugurated {{planning for}} the New Look in July 1953 by asking the incoming members of the JCS (Admiral Arthur W. Radford, chairman; General Matthew B. Ridgway, Army chief of staff; General Nathan F. Twining, Air Force chief of staff; and Admiral Robert B. Carney, chief of naval operations) to prepare a paper on overall defense policy. Although the JCS paper did not recommend any fundamental changes, the National Security Council in October 1953 adopted a key tenet of the New Look that a large-scale limited war or a general war would likely be fought with nuclear weapons. Eisenhower formally presented the New Look <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union message in January 1954 and Secretary Wilson helped to explain it. More defense for less money was possible, he said. With new weapons and techniques and ready reserves of troops and materiel, the United States could support capable military forces within budget allocations that Congress was willing to provide.|$|E

500|$|Freedom of Worship or Freedom to Worship is {{the second}} of the Four Freedoms oil {{paintings}} produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell. The series was based on the goals known as the Four Freedoms enunciated by the 32nd President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union Address delivered on January 6, 1941. [...] Rockwell considered this painting and Freedom of Speech the most successful of the series. Freedom of Worship was published on the 27th of February, 1943, issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by philosopher Will Durant.|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} {{also helped}} {{to promote a}} change in U.S. policy regarding Native Americans. Previously, many Americans had argued that Indians should be [...] "civilized" [...] and assimilated into white American society. But for some, the Winnebago War discredited the idea that Indians and Americans could live peaceably together. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union Address of December 2, 1828, outgoing President Adams announced that the [...] "civilization" [...] policy had been a failure, and that Indian removal—moving the tribes to the West—was {{the policy of the}} future. That policy would be taken up by Adams's successor, Andrew Jackson.|$|E
500|$|To Marcy's chagrin, the {{flamboyant}} Soulé {{made no secret}} of the meetings. The press in both Europe and the U.S. were well aware of the proceedings if not their outcome, but were preoccupied with wars and midterm elections. In the latter case, the Democratic Party became a minority in the United States Congress, and editorials continued to chide the Pierce administration for its secrecy. At least one newspaper, the New York Herald, published what Brown calls [...] "reports that came so close to the truth of the decisions at Ostend that the President feared they were based on leaks, as indeed they may have been". Pierce feared the political repercussions of confirming such rumors, and he did not acknowledge them <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union address at the end of 1854. The administration's opponents in the House of Representatives called for the document's release, and it was published in full four months after being written.|$|E
