A complementary property is stress relaxation, where a strain is applied and the corresponding stress change is measured. The mode of measurement is not directly available with most thermomechanical instruments. Stress relaxation is available using any standard universal test instruments, since their mode of operation is application of strain, while the stress is measured.|$|E
50|$|Galileo's {{early studies}} at the University of Pisa were in medicine, but he was soon drawn to {{mathematics}} and physics. At 19, he discovered (and, subsequently, verified) the <b>isochronal</b> nature of the pendulum when, using his pulse, he timed the oscillations of a swinging lamp in Pisa's cathedral {{and found that it}} remained the same for each swing regardless of the swing's amplitude. He soon became known through his invention of a hydrostatic balance and for his treatise on the center of gravity of solid bodies. While teaching at the University of Pisa (1589-92), he initiated his experiments concerning the laws of bodies in motion that brought results so contradictory to the accepted teachings of Aristotle that strong antagonism was aroused. He found that bodies do not fall with velocities proportional to their weights. The famous story in which Galileo is said to have dropped weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa is apocryphal, but he did find that the path of a projectile is a parabola and is credited with conclusions that anticipated Newton's laws of motion (e.g. the notion of inertia). Among these is what is now called Galilean relativity, the first precisely formulated statement about properties of space and time outside three-dimensional geometry.|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{whether it}} can be shown {{experimentally}} if different types of liquids obey <b>isochronal</b> superposition. This investigation holds importance because a new theory, the isomorph theory, predicts that van der Waal liquids obey <b>isochronal</b> superposition. A definition of <b>isochronal</b> superposition, {{as well as those}} of Time-Pressure-Superposition and Time-Temperature-Pressure-Superposition, is established. <b>Isochronal</b> superposition is investigated for the dielectric relaxation spectrum. Dielectric measurements are made on four different liquids on a high pressure setup in relation to this project. Furthermore, data on two other liquids are included in this investigation. Two liquids studied are hydrogen bonded liquids, while four of them are van der Waal liquids. The high pressure measurement equipment used is relatively new and it is therefore first scrutinised before use in this thesis. Different measures, with the purpose of deciding to which degree a liquid obeys respectively <b>isochronal</b> superposition and Time-Temperature-Pressure-Superposition, are developed. These measures are based on the half width at half depth and the area deviation between the dielectric relaxation spectra. From these measures, it is concluded that the investigated van der Waal liquids obey <b>isochronal</b> superposition better than the investigated hydrogen bonded liquids. It is furthermore estimated that the investigated van der Waal liquids obey <b>isochronal</b> superposition and that some also obey Time-Temperature-Pressure-Superposition. It is concluded, that the studied hydrogen bonded liquids obey neither Time-Temperature- Pressure-Superposition nor <b>isochronal</b> superposition.

The dilatometric method was used for studies of isothermal ageing, DTA for studies of ageing during <b>isochronal</b> heating. In order to determine isothermal transformation kinetics the JMA (Johnson – Mehl – Avrami) equation was applied, for <b>isochronal</b> heating transformation kinetics Kissinger method was used. Ageing of Al- Cu alloys consist of precipitation processes and dissolution processes that overlap each other. These processes, during isothermal ageing were distinguished with help of the time exponent n of JMA equation that is very sensitive to change of the transformation mechanism.
