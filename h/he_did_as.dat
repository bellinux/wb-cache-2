5|$|Khánh {{used the}} coup to enact {{retribution}} against Minh's leading generals. Khánh had Kim, Don, Dinh and Xuan arrested, {{claiming that they}} were part of a neutralist plot with the French. Khánh noted that they had served in the Vietnamese National Army in the early 1950s, under the French colonial administration, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> well. Lan was also arrested as a suspected French agent. The junta members were caught totally unaware. Minh, Don and Kim woke up to find hostile forces surrounding their houses and thought it to be a quixotic stunt by some disgruntled young officers.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a legend}} King Indradyumma was {{directed}} by Lord Jagannath in a dream to build a temple for him which <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> directed. However, according to historical records the temple was started some time during the 12th century by King Chodaganga of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. It was completed by his descendant, Anangabhima Deva, in the 12th century. The wooden images of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were then deified here. The temple was {{under the control of}} the Hindu rulers up to 1558. Then, when Orissa was occupied by the Afghan Nawab of Bengal, it was brought {{under the control of the}} Afghan General Kalapahad. Following the defeat of the Afghan king by Raja Mansingh, the General of Mughal emperor Akbar, the temple became part of the Mughal empire till 1751. Subsequently, it was under the control of the Marathas till 1803. During the British Raj, the Puri Raja was entrusted with its management until 1947.|$|E

5|$|Although Mansfield's transformations between Jekyll and Hyde {{included}} lighting {{changes and}} makeup designed to appear different under colored filters, it was mainly accomplished by the actor's facial contortions {{and changes in}} posture and movement. As Hyde, Mansfield was hunched over with a grimacing face and claw-like hands; he spoke with a guttural voice and walked differently than <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> Jekyll. The effect was so dramatic that audiences and journalists speculated {{about how it was}} achieved. Theories included claims that Mansfield had an inflatable rubber prosthetic, that he applied chemicals, and that he had a mask hidden in a wig, which he pulled down to complete the change.|$|E
5|$|County {{finished}} the 2007–08 season {{fourth in the}} league, and subsequently won their play-off semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers 2–1 on aggregate. The club had previously visited Wembley four times, and Gannon had played on all four occasions. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> a manager what he could never do as a player, and guided Stockport victory at Wembley; the 3–2 win over Rochdale earned Gannon's club promotion to League One. He refused to give a post-match interview to Sky Sports following a nine-month dispute with the company over a broken Skybox. Nevertheless, having quickly taken Stockport from the foot of League Two and into League One on a meagre budget, Gannon had established himself {{as one of the}} most highly rated young managers in the lower leagues. In the summer he sold Liam Dickinson to Derby County for £750,000 – a player signed by previous manager, Chris Turner from Woodley Sports for a nominal fee just over two years previous.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Saggers had few {{opportunities}} with the bat, generally batting between No. 8 and No. 10,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included {{the likes of}} Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, who were all capable batsmen. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level. As a result, many of the bowlers batted before <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> <b>As</b> Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions, Saggers only had 12 innings in his 17 first-class fixtures and was not out three times after his remaining partners had been dismissed.|$|E

25|$|Khánh {{used the}} coup to enact {{retribution}} against Minh, Đôn, Kim, Đính and Xuân. He had them arrested, {{claiming that they}} were part of a neutralist plot with the French. Khánh cited their service in the Vietnamese National Army in the early 1950s, under the French colonial administration as evidence, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> well. Khánh also had Major Nhung, the bodyguard of Minh, shot, causing riots among parts of the population who feared that Khánh would wind back the clock to the Diệm era. Khánh later persuaded Minh to remain as a figurehead head of state. This was partly due to pressure from American officials, who felt that the popular Minh would be a unifying and stabilising factor in the new regime. However, Khánh soon sidelined Minh.|$|E
25|$|The {{gas line}} {{from the back of}} the house's furnace had been pulled out in an attempt to conceal {{evidence}} of the homicide. The accumulating gas was later ignited by a candle that Fisher had allegedly lit, waiting for the gas to accumulate and descend to the flame hours after being lit. This delayed fuse would have given Fisher an approximate 10 hour head start in his successful attempt to evade law enforcement. Burned bodies of a woman and two children were found lying in bed in the remains of the burnt out house. They were identified as Mary (age 38), and her two children, Brittney (age 12) and Bobby (age 10). Investigators have theorized that Fisher murdered his family because he felt threatened by Mary's intent to divorce him, and didn't want his children to go through what <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> a child.|$|E
25|$|Records of the {{excavations}} and the finds {{exist in}} Woodford's letters to his brother, Alexander, which were {{preserved in the}} Nachlaß of the English politician Roger Newdigate (1719-1806). These letters also include illustrations of certain finds, namely a coin and an arrow-head. Alongside the discoveries, there is also thought to have existed a diary, although it is suspected {{this may have been}} lost in a fire at an establishment on Belgrave Square called the Pantechnicon, which gave its name to the van, in 1874 or 1876. Whilst excavating, Woodford received considerable hostility from the local French, who considered Woodford to be desecrating the graves of the war-dead in order to conduct a celebration commemorating the English victory. This appears to have been little but spin, as the letters highlight Woodford's intention to re-bury any dead which he found in consecrated ground - this <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>as</b> there is reported to be several dead from Azincourt buried in the local church under an etching in the wall that reads '1838'.|$|E

25|$|Dryden was prolific; and he {{was often}} accused of plagiarism. Both before and after his Laureateship, he wrote public odes. He {{attempted}} the Jacobean pastoral {{along the lines of}} Walter Raleigh and Philip Sidney, but his greatest successes and fame came from his attempts at apologetics for the restored court and the Established Church. His Absalom and Achitophel and Religio Laici both served the King directly by making controversial royal actions seem reasonable. He also pioneered the mock-heroic. Although Samuel Butler had invented the mock-heroic in English with Hudibras (written during the Interregnum but published in the Restoration), Dryden's MacFlecknoe set up the satirical parody. Dryden was himself not of noble blood, {{and he was}} never awarded the honours that he had been promised by the King (nor was he repaid the loans he had made to the King), but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> much as any peer to serve Charles II. Even when James II came to the throne and Roman Catholicism was on the rise, Dryden attempted to serve the court, and his The Hind and the Panther praised the Roman church above all others. After that point, Dryden suffered for his conversions, and he was the victim of many satires.|$|E
25|$|The 1924 South Africans {{lost the}} Test series to England by three matches to nil, with two draws, with the {{weakness}} of the bowling singled out by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in its review of the tour as a prime cause for failure. Deane himself merited not a single mention in the four-page Wisden article describing the highlights of the tour, and his tour figures indicate that he was rarely prominent: in 25 first-class matches, he passed 50 only once, and his 621 runs came at an average of 22.18. The one half-century was a not-out innings of 80 in a match against Scotland in which the South Africans comprehensively outplayed their hosts. Despite this modest record, Deane was picked as a specialist batsman for all five Test matches and in a team in which only Bob Catterall and, to a lesser degree, Fred Susskind made many runs, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> much as most of his team-mates, scoring 143 runs at an average of 23.83. Mostly he batted in lower middle order at No 7, and his best score came in the third Test when he reverted to that position for the second innings, having opened the batting in the first innings, and made an unbeaten 47 that forced England to bat again after South Africa had followed on 264 runs behind on the first innings.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Zheng He is {{explicitly}} {{mentioned in the}} Mingshi in connection to the visits of Ganbali (possibly Coimatore), Lasa, Djorfar, Magadishu, and Brava. Ganbali is in southern India, Lasa and Djorfar is on the southern coast of Arabia, and Magadishu and Brava is in Somalia (Africa). Dreyer (2007) states that the account is unclear on whether he did go to those places in person. The wording in the Mingshi could indicate that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>as</b> the account stated that he proclaimed imperial instructions to the kings of these countries. Although, this may as well not be the case, because the fleet only made short stops at Calicut (4 days outward and 9 days homeward) {{that could not have}} provided enough time to travel overland to Ganbali, unless the location did not refer to Coimatore but elsewhere in southern India. The overland journey may have been undertaken by someone else than Zheng He himself. The Mingshi account about Lasa states that ambassadors from Lasa, Aden, and Brava traveled with Zheng He to China. This meant that the ships carrying them had possibly reassembled with the main fleet in Calicut according to Dreyer (2007), depending on whether Zheng He visited these countries in person or remained with the main portion of the fleet. Dreyer (2007) thinks that the detached squadrons had probably already assembled at Calicut for its homeward journey, because the main fleet didn't stay there for long.|$|E
