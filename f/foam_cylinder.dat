40|$|International audienceThe {{efficient}} use of plastic foams in a diverse range of structural applications like in noise reduction, cushioning, and sleeping mattresses requires detailed characterization of their permeability and deformation (load-bearing) behavior. The elastic moduli and airflow resistance properties of foams are often measured using two separate techniques, one employing mechanical vibration methods and the other, flow rates of fluids based on fluid mechanics technology, respectively. A multi-parameter inverse acoustic scattering problem to recover airflow resistivity (AR) and mechanical properties of an air-saturated <b>foam</b> <b>cylinder</b> is solved. A wave-fluid saturated poroelastic structure interaction model based on the modified Biot theory and plane-wave decomposition using orthogonal cylindrical functions is employed to solve the inverse problem. The solutions to the inverse problem are obtained by constructing the objective functional given by the total square {{of the difference between}} predictions from the model and scattered acoustic field data acquired in an anechoic chamber. The value of the recovered AR is in good agreement with that of a slab sample cut from the cylinder and characterized using a method employing low frequency transmitted and reflected acoustic waves in a long waveguide developed by Fellah et al.

Two dimensional results of planar PIV reveal the important aspects of the local flow features of the circular finned and <b>foamed</b> <b>cylinders.</b> These include turbulent boundary layer development over the surface and a delayed separation of the flow resulting in a smaller wake size in each case. The application of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to the PIV velocity fields of the two cylinder types is also discussed. The POD computed for the measured velocity fields for both cases shows that the first two spatial modes contain most of the kinetic energy of the flow irrespective to the cylinder type.

The higher density foams are used as {{standard}} biomechanical test materials, but none of the low density PU foams are universally accepted as models for osteoporotic (OP) bone. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether low density PU foam might be suitable for mimicking human OP cancellous bone. Methods Quasi-static compression tests were performed on PU <b>foam</b> <b>cylinders</b> of different lengths (3. 9 and 7. 7 mm) and of different densities (0. 09, 0. 16 and 0. 32 g. cm - 3), to determine the Young's modulus, yield strength and energy absorbed to yield. Results Young's modulus values were 0. 08 – 0. 93 MPa for the 0. 09 g. cm - 3 foam and from 15. 1 – 151. 4 MPa for the 0. 16 and 0. 32 g. cm - 3 foam. Yield strength values were 0. 01 – 0. 07 MPa for the 0. 09 g. cm - 3 foam and from 0. 9 – 4. 5 MPa for the 0. 16 and 0. 32 g. cm - 3 foam.

Under cyclic deformation there is a progressive decay of the loading curve, while the unloading curve remains essentially the same at all cycles. To describe this complex response we propose a rheological model, in which the foam is represented as a chain of nonlinear elastic springs with a non-convex strain energy, connected in parallel {{with a series of}} springs subject to progressive damage. The chain of springs models the strain localization, and the second series of springs reproduces the cyclic response.

40|$|Abstract Recent {{measurements}} of the precursor ablation velocity show that the velocity is reduced significantly when the gap to core size ratio is less than π, implying a higher mass ablation rate and {{a change in the}} precursor density profile at the time of implosion. This might explain why experimentally there appears to be an optimal inter-wire gap for the shortest rise time of the x-ray pulse. 2 -D kinetic modelling of the precursor plasma shows how long mean-free-path ions can lead to the accumulation of a central dense, radiating column. Precursor interaction with a <b>foam</b> <b>cylinder</b> is also modelled with material mixing allowed. Three effects are being studied that can increase the final x-ray radiation. One is the effect of later implosion of trailing mass, diagnosed by laser probing and modelled by 2 -D simulations. A second mechanism is the development of m= 1 instabilities and associated increase in ohmic dissipation from current path lengthening. The third is ion viscous heating arising from saturated non-linear, short wavelength MHD m= 0 instabilities. Experimental evidence at 20 MA on the Z-accelerator shows Doppler broadened spectra at stagnation with ion temperature in the 100 - 300 keV range, lending support for this last mechanism. 1...|$|E

Foams are often employed in the audible, low frequency range where modeling and measurement techniques for the recovery of physical parameters responsible for energy loss are still few. Accurate acoustic methods of characterization of porous media are based on the measurement of the transmitted and/or reflected acoustic waves by platelike specimens at ultrasonic frequencies. In this study we develop an acoustic method for the recovery of the material parameters of a rigid-frame, air-saturated polymeric <b>foam</b> <b>cylinder.</b> A dispersion relation for sound wave propagation in the porous medium is derived from the propagation equations and a model solution is sought based on plane-wave decomposition using orthogonal cylindrical functions. The explicit analytical solution equation of the scattered field shows that it is also dependent on the intrinsic acoustic parameters of the porous cylinder, namely, porosity, tortuosity, and flow resistivity (permeability).

Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited and blinded either to genuine acupuncture or to “placebo procedures”, and they were checked to ascertain whether they could differentiate genuine punctures from placebo punctures. Each volunteer received paired procedures on three separate occasions. Each paired procedure included one genuine puncture and a placebo procedure. Three placebo procedures, that is, sham points, superficial puncture, and puncturing through a special device, were used. Two standard acupuncture points were used: Hegu (LI- 4) in the hand and Zusanli (ST- 36) in the leg. Among the 18 participants who completed all three tests, 16 correctly recognized genuine punctures. Sham sites in the hand and the leg were detected by 15 and nine of the participants, respectively. Superficial punctures in the hand and the leg were recognized by 10 and nine of the participants, respectively. A special device, a <b>foam</b> <b>cylinder</b> that hid the distal needle, worked best because 15 and 16 of the participants were deceived when the device was used at an acupoint in the hand and the leg, respectively.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the constitutive modelling of dissipative open-cell structural cellular solids under primarily finite compressive deformations {{and the corresponding}} non-linear finite element implementation. A thermodynamically consistent, mechanistic approach presented in Hard of Segerstad et al. [Hard of Segerstad, P., Larsson, R., Toll, S., 2008. A constitutive equation for open-cell cellular solids, including viscoplasticity, damage and deformation induced anisotropy. International Journal of Plasticity. 24, 896 - 914. ] is adopted for modelling the initial linear-elastic response and the subsequent plateau behaviour. In these regions the cellular solid is considered as a network of struts, where each strut connects two vertex points. A hypothesis is proposed that the vertex points move affinely in the finite strain regime, where the struts buckle plastically. The strut deformation is further assumed to be one-dimensional and depend directly on the macroscopic deformation; thus {{the description of the}} strut response requires only a scalar valued response function. Owing to this simple ansatz, the introduction of multiple non-linear mechanisms, such as hyperelasto-viscoplasticity and damage becomes feasible for large scale computations. An additional hyperelastic volumetric response, activated near the point-of-compaction, is introduced for two reasons, (i) to capture the stiffness recovery at high compressive volumetric deformations, where the struts come into contact, and (ii) to prevent numerical instability. The model is implemented as a user defined constitutive driver in the implicit version of the finite element code ABAQUS and tested experimentally for an open-cell aluminium alloy foam (Duocel 6101 - 0, 40 ppi).

40|$|Response of {{removable}} epoxy foam (REF) to {{high heat}} fluxes is described using a decomposition chemistry model [1] {{in conjunction with}} a finite element heat conduction code [2] that supports chemical kinetics and dynamic radiation enclosures. The chemistry model [1] describes the temporal transformation of virgin foam into carbonaceous residue by considering breakdown of the foam polymer structure, desorption of gases not associated with the foam polymer, mass transport of decomposition products from the reaction site to the bulk gas, and phase equilibrium. The finite element foam response model considers the spatial behavior of the foam by using measured and predicted thermophysical properties in combination with the decomposition chemistry model. Foam elements are removed from the computational domain when the condensed mass fractions of the foam elements are close to zero.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} and compare the separated flow structures behind bare and metal foam-covered single circular cylinders by means of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The experiments are conducted for a range of Reynolds numbers from 2000 to 8000 based on the outer cylinders diameter and the air velocity upstream of the cylinder. The two dimensional planar PIV results as well as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis show the important effects of the inlet velocity and the foam cover on the separated structures. The results show a considerable increase of the wake size behind a foam-wrapped cylinder compared to that of a bare cylinder. Interestingly, the wake size increases with Re for a foamed cylinder while for the identical bare cylinder the converse is true. Furthermore, the shedding frequency is found to be around 10 % higher in the case of the foam-wrapped cylinder where the wake size is approximately doubled for the former case compared to the latter. The swirl strength, however, is found to be strongly Reynolds-dependent at higher Reynolds numbers. With low Re values, the swirl strength remains the same for the two cases considered here while, on average, it is 15 % higher with the foamed case. Our results showed that, with the same fluid velocity, the foamed-cylinders considered in this study cannot be modeled as a bare cylinder of the same size but with a rough surface. In addition, energy of the large scale separated structures spreads between modes and also the small scale structures contribute to the formation of the flow structures in <b>foam</b> <b>cylinder</b> making them a more efficient turbulent generator for the next rows when used in a heat exchanger tube bundle.

The 0.4  wt% SDS solution, above the CMC value (0.23  wt%), was used to aid the attachment of SiO 2 nanoparticles at the foam interface by lowering the surface tension to its minimum value.|$|R
40|$|The {{sandwich}} composites fuselages {{appear to}} be a promising choice for the future aircrafts because of their structural efficiency and functional integration advantages. However, the design of sandwich composites is more complex than other structures because of many involved variables. In this paper, the fuselage is designed as a sandwich composites cylinder, and its structural optimization using the finite element method (FEM) is outlined to obtain the minimum weight. The constraints include structural stability and the composites failure criteria. In order to get a verification baseline for the FEManalysis, the stability of sandwich structures is studied and the optimal design is performed based on the analytical formulae. Then, the predicted buckling loads and the optimization results obtained froma FEMmodel are compared with that from the analytical formulas, and a good agreement is achieved. A detailed parametric optimal design for the sandwich composites cylinder is conducted. The optimization method used here includes two steps: the minimization of the layer thickness followed by tailoring of the fiber orientation. The factors comprise layer number, fiber orientation, core thickness, frame dimension and spacing. Results show that the two-step optimization is an effective method for the sandwich composites and the <b>foam</b> sandwich <b>cylinder</b> with core thickness of 5 mm and frame pitch of 0. 5 m exhibits the minimum weight.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} and compare the wake behind fin and <b>foam</b> covered circular <b>cylinders</b> by mean of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). Two different arrangements were examined namely single cylinder and a single-row bundle of three identical cylinders in cross flow. The experiments are conducted for a range of Reynolds numbers from 1500 to 8000 based on the inner cylinders diameter and the air velocity upstream of the bundle. The two dimensional planar PIV results as well as POD analysis show the important effects of the inlet velocity, the foam and fin covers, as well as cylinder arrangement, being an isolated single cylinder or bundled, on the wake. The results show a considerable increase of the wake size by using the foam instead of fin in single tube. The results of this study can be used as an accurate boundary condition to model the flow field past such cylinders...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years there has been a growing {{interest}} in lightweight metal foams. Demands for weight reduction, improved fuel efficiency, and increased passenger safety in automobiles now has manufacturers seriously considering the use of metal foams, in contrast to a few years ago, when the same materials would have been ruled out for technical or economical reasons. The objective of this program was to advance the development and use of steel foam materials, by demonstrating the advantages of these novel lightweight materials in selected generic applications. Progress was made in defining materials and process parameters; characterization of physical and mechanical properties; and fabrication and testing of generic steel foam-filled shapes with compositions from 2. 5 wt. % to 0. 7 wt. % carbon. A means of producing steel foam shapes with uniform long range porosity levels of 50 to 60 percent was demonstrated and verified with NDE methods. Steel <b>foam</b> integrated beams, <b>cylinders</b> and plates were mechanically tested and demonstrated advantages in bend stiffness, bend resistance, and crush energy absorption. Methods of joining by welding, adhesive bonding, and mechanical fastening were investigated. It {{is important to keep in}} mind that steel foam is a conventional material in an unconventional form. A substantial amount of physical and mechanical properties are presented throughout the report and in a properties database at the end of the report to support designer's in applying steel foam in unconventional ways...|$|R
40|$|Rigid {{polyurethane}} foam {{is used in}} many different applications because of its high insulating capacity. CFC- 11 has been the predominant blowing agent due to its advantageous properties, especially its low thermal conductivity. To prevent a depletion of ozone in the stratosphere {{and an increase in}} global warming, the use of CFCs and similar compounds is now being phased out. Less environmentally harmful alternatives thus have to be developed. In order to study the performance of blowing agents their concentration and their distribution in the foam must be measured. A method for analysis of the cell gases in rigid foam was developed. Partial pressures of all gases in the cells could thus be determined as well as the amount of condensed blowing agent. Three methods involving heating and weight-loss determination were elaborated for the determination of the blowing agent distribution in rigid foam. A combustion method was also applied and a method for solvent extraction developed. Experiments were performed both on pieces of foam and on powdered foam. The analytical methods were applied in several studies, mainly on rigid {{polyurethane foam}}s blown with CFC- 11, water or cyclopentane. Changes in partial pressures over time were determined and used to calculate effective diffusion coefficients of the different gases in slabs or cylinders, cut from the <b>foam.</b> Slabs or <b>cylinders</b> of different sizes are recommended for gases with widely differing diffusion coefficients. The influence of surface materials, such as the outer polyethylene casing on district heating pipes, on the rate of diffusion was measured. Assessments were made of the amount and distribution of CFC- 11 in old insulating foams. The total remaining amount of CFC- 11 in old district heating pipes in Sweden was estimated at about 2000 tonnes. Treatment of polyurethane foam waste is discussed...|$|R
