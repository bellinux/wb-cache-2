40|$|In current {{purification}} processes optimization of {{the capture}} step generally {{has a large}} impact on cost reduction. At present, valuable biomolecules are often produced in relatively low concentrations and, consequently, the eventual selective separation from complex mixtures can be rather inefficient. A separation technology based on a very selective high-affinity binding may overcome these problems. Proteins in their natural environment manifest functionality by interacting specifically and often with relatively high affinity with other molecules, such as substrates, inhibitors, activators, or other proteins. At present, antibodies are {{the most commonly used}} binding proteins in numerous applications. However, antibodies do have limitations, such as high production costs, low stability, and a complex patent landscape. A novel approach is therefore to use non-immunoglobulin engineered binding proteins in affinity purification. In order to obtain <b>engineered</b> <b>binders</b> with a desired specificity, a large mutant library of the new to-be-developed binding protein has to be created and screened for potential binders. A powerful technique to screen and select for proteins with desired properties from a large pool of variants is phage display. Here, we indicate several criteria for potential binding protein scaffolds and explain the principle of M 13 phage display. In addition, we describe experimental protocols for the initial steps in setting up a M 13 phage display system based on the pComb 3 X vector, including construction of the phagemid vector, production of phages displaying the protein of interest, and confirmation of display on the M 13 phage...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGlycosylation {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and {{important}} post-translational modifications, influencing both the chemical and the biological properties of proteins. Studying the glycosylation of the entire protein population of a sample can be challenging because variations in the concentrations of certain proteins can enhance or obscure changes in glycosylation. Furthermore, alterations in the glycosylation pattern of individual proteins, exhibiting larger variability in disease states, have been suggested as biomarkers for different types of cancer, as well as inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. In this paper, we present a rapid and efficient method for glycosylation analysis of individual proteins focusing on changes in the degree of fucosylation or other alterations to the core structure of the glycans, such as the presence of bisecting N-acetylglucosamines and a modified degree of branching. Streptavidin-coated magnetic beads are used in combination with genetically <b>engineered</b> immunoaffinity <b>binders,</b> called VHH antibody fragments. A major advantage of the VHHs is that they are nonglycosylated; thus, enzymatic release of glycans from the targeted protein can be performed directly on the beads. After deglycosylation, the glycans are analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. The developed method was evaluated concerning its specificity, and thereafter implemented for studying the glycosylation pattern of two different proteins, alpha- 1 -antitrypsin and transferrin, in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a protein array-type experiment that employs bead-based immunoaffinity purification in combination with mass spectrometry analysis for fast and efficient glycan analysis of individual proteins in biological fluid...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} techniques, {{including}} high-pressure unfolding monitored by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, fluorescence, circular dichroism, and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, {{have been used}} to investigate the equilibrium folding properties of six single-domain antigen binders derived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies with specificities for lysozymes, beta-lactamases, and a dye (RR 6). Various denaturing conditions (guanidinium chloride, urea, temperature, and pressure) provided complementary and independent methods for characterizing the stability and unfolding properties of the antibody fragments. With all binders, complete recovery of the biological activity after renaturation demonstrates that chemical- induced unfolding is fully reversible. Furthermore, denaturation experiments followed by optical spectroscopic methods and affinity measurements indicate that the antibody fragments are unfolded cooperatively in a single transition. Thus, unfolding/refolding equilibrium proceeds via a simple two-state mechanism (Nreversible arrowU), where only the native and the denatured states are significantly populated. Thermally- induced denaturation, however, is not completely reversible, and the partial loss of binding capacity might be due, at least in part, to incorrect refolding of the long loops (CDRs), which are responsible for antigen recognition. Most interestingly, all the fragments are rather resistant to heat-induced denaturation (apparent T-m= 60 - 80 degrees-C), and display high conformational stabilities (DeltaG(H 2 O) = 30 - 60 kJ mole(- 1)). Such high thermodynamic stability has never been reported for any functional conventional antibody fragment, even when <b>engineered</b> antigen <b>binders</b> are considered. Hence, the reduced size, improved solubility, and higher stability of the camelid heavy-chain antibody fragments are of special interest for biotechnological and medical applications. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a phage display methodology to <b>engineer</b> synthetic antigen <b>binders</b> (sABs) that recognize either the apo- or the ligand-bound conformation of maltose binding protein (MBP). sABs that preferentially recognize the maltose-bound form of MBP act as positive allosteric effectors by significantly increasing the affinity for maltose. A crystal {{structure of a}} sAB bound to the closed form of MBP reveals {{the basis for the}} exhibited allosteric effect. We show that sABs which recognize the bound form of MBP can rescue the function of a binding-deficient mutant by restoring its natural affinity for maltose. Further, the sABs can enhance maltose binding in vivo by providing a growth advantage to bacteria under low maltose conditions. The results demonstrate that structure-specific sABs can be engineered to dynamically control ligand-binding affinities by modulating the transition between different conformations. Numerous biological processes are regulated through the interactions of proteins with small molecules or other proteins. In many cases, these interactions induce conformational changes that directly modulate activities or provide new binding sites that facilitate building higher order organizations. Thus, it is recognized that the ability to engineer systems tha...|$|R
40|$|Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) {{represent}} a novel class of binding molecules. Their favorable biophysical properties {{such as high}} affinity, stability and expression yields make them ideal candidates for tumor targeting. Here, we describe the selection of DARPins specific for the tumor-associated antigen epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), an approved therapeutic target on solid tumors. We selected DARPins from combinatorial libraries by both phage display and ribosome display and compared their binding on tumor cells. By further rounds of random mutagenesis and ribosome display selection, binders with picomolar affinity were obtained that were entirely monomeric and could be expressed at high yields in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. One of the binders, denoted Ec 1, bound to EpCAM with picomolar affinity (K(d) = 68  pM), and another selected DARPin (Ac 2) recognized a different epitope on EpCAM. Through {{the use of a}} variety of bivalent and tetravalent arrangements with these DARPins, the off-rate on cells was further improved by up to 47 -fold. All EpCAM-specific DARPins were efficiently internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis, which is essential for intracellular delivery of anticancer agents to tumor cells. Thus, using EpCAM as a target, we provide evidence that DARPins can be conveniently selected and rationally <b>engineered</b> to high-affinity <b>binders</b> of various formats for tumor targeting...|$|R
40|$|Investigating protein {{location}} and concentration {{is critical to}} understanding function. Reagentless biosensors, in which a reporting fluorophore is conjugated to a binding scaffold, can detect analytes of interest with high temporal and spatial resolution. However, because these biosensors require laborious empirical screening to develop, their adoption has been limited. Hence, we establish design principles that will facilitate development. In this thesis, we first develop a kinetic model for the dynamic performance of a reagentless biosensor. Using a sinusoidal signal for ligand concentration, {{our findings suggest that}} it is optimal to use a binding moiety whose equilibrium dissociation constant matches that of the average predicted input signal, while maximizing both the association rate constant and the dissociation rate constant at the necessary ratio to create the desired equilibrium constant. Although practical limitations constrain the attainment of these objectives, the derivation of these design principles provides guidance for improved reagentless biosensor performance and metrics for quality standards in the development of biosensors. Following these guidelines, we use the human tenth type III fibronectin domain to <b>engineer</b> new <b>binders</b> against several ligands of the EGFR receptor. Using these binders and others, we design and characterize biosensors based on various target analytes, scaffolds and fluorophores. We observe that analytes can harbor specific binding pockets for the fluorophore, which sharply increase the fluorescence produced upon binding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a fluorophore conjugated to locally rigid surfaces possesses lower background fluorescence. Based on these newly identified properties, we design biosensors that produce a 100 -fold increase in fluorescence upon binding to analyte, about a 10 -fold improvement over the previous best biosensor. In order to improve the methodology of reagentless biosensor design, we establish a method for site-specific labeling of proteins displayed on the surface of yeasts. This procedure allows for the screening of libraries of sensors for binding and fluorescence enhancement simultaneously. Finally, we explore an alternative sensor design, based on competitive inhibition of fluorescence quenching. by Seymour de Picciotto. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Pro-survival {{members of}} the Bcl- 2 protein family inhibit cell death by binding short helical BH 3 motifs in pro-apoptotic {{proteins}}. Mammalian pro-survival proteins Bcl-x[subscript L], Bcl- 2, Bcl-w, Mcl- 1, and Bfl- 1 bind with varying affinities and specificities to native BH 3 motifs, engineered peptides, and small molecules. Biophysical studies have determined interaction patterns for these proteins, particularly for the most-studied family members Bcl-x[subscript L] and Mcl- 1. Bfl- 1 is a pro-survival protein implicated in preventing apoptosis in leukemia, lymphoma, and melanoma. Although Bfl- 1 is a promising therapeutic target, relatively {{little is known about}} its binding preferences. We explored the binding of Bfl- 1 to BH 3 -like peptides by screening a peptide library that was designed to sample a high degree of relevant sequence diversity. Screening using yeast-surface display led to several novel high-affinity Bfl- 1 binders and to thousands of putative binders identified through deep sequencing. Further screening for specificity led to identification of a peptide that bound to Bfl- 1 with K[subscript d] < 1 nM and very slow dissociation from Bfl- 1 compared to other pro-survival Bcl- 2 family members. A point mutation in this sequence gave a peptide with ~ 50 nM affinity for Bfl- 1 that was selective for Bfl- 1 in equilibrium binding assays. Analysis of <b>engineered</b> Bfl- 1 <b>binders</b> deepens our understanding of how the binding profiles of pro-survival proteins differ and may guide the development of targeted Bfl- 1 inhibitors.

40|$|Pretargeted {{radioimmunotherapy}} (PRIT) {{of cancer}} improves upon conventional radioimmunotherapy (RIT) by decoupling the pharmacokinetics of the targeting agent and the radioisotope. In {{order to improve}} upon PRIT, we have considered variables such as treatment setting and methodology, the transport and clearance characteristics of targeting agents, and the radionuclides used for therapy. PRIT has been modeled {{with the aim of}} examining the theoretical potential of PRIT under optimal conditions to kill every cell in malignant, avascular micrometastases. A mathematical model of PRIT was developed that combined a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model, antibody binding kinetics, diffusion and catabolism in tumor spheroids, and radiation dosimetry models for alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides. This model demonstrated that it is theoretically possible to kill every cell in 100 tm radius micrometastases using 9 Y- or 213 Bi-based PRIT with acceptable toxicity as described. The therapeutic window for dosing radionuclide-carrying hapten was found to be strongly dependent on cell-specific parameters such as antigen concentration, void fraction, and the radiosensitivity parameter a, as well as on targeting agent molecular parameters such as the diffusivity and antigen-binding association rate. (cont.) Surprisingly, the therapeutic window was insensitive to the radiosensitivity metric a/I, the targeting agent antigen-binding dissociation rate, and all pharmacokinetic parameters. Overall, 213 Bi-based PRIT significantly outperformed 9 Y-based PRIT in terms of the safe therapeutic time window for radiometal dosing and the degree of cell overkill that could be achieved. An attempt was made to isolate high-affinity scFv or linear peptide binders against the loaded metal chelate Ga-DOTA-biotin. Unfortunately, several different approaches led only to scFvs and linear peptides with at best micromolar affinity for Ga-DOTA-biotin. It is possible that Ga-DOTA-biotin is a difficult target against which to <b>engineer</b> high affinity <b>binders</b> due to the chelate's six-coordinate binding of the gallium ion, which may result in rapid exchange of the carboxyl arms of the chelate in solution. As an alternative approach to targeting agent design, an anti-CEA, anti-fluorescein single-chain bispecific diabody was designed, produced in S. cerevisiae and characterized. The full-length diabody (55 kDa) binds CEA expressed on the surface of colorectal cancer-derived SW 1222 cells with a KI of 4. 3 ± 2. 5 nM, and also binds fluorescein while bound to CEA on the cell surface.

40|$|The {{simplicity}} and cost-effectiveness of direct compression {{makes it a}} preferred method of commercial tablet manufacturing. Excipients {{play a central role}} in determining the success of direct compression. Currently available directly compressible excipients are typically effective at relatively high proportion of > 50 % (w/w). For high-dose APIs, incorporation of such high excipient load is inappropriate, as this may necessitate the formation of large tablets, which may be difficult to ingest. Thus, high-dose APIs (especially for poorly flowable and difficult to compact) are often considered unsuitable for tablet manufacturing by direct compression. In interactive mixtures, small guest particles (typically < 10 µm) adhere to larger host particles. We hypothesized that small binder particles could express a binder action as well as a flow additive action, if they could form a suitable interactive mixture with large APIs. However, many such small particles are highly cohesive, which limits their de-agglomeration, dispersion and consequently the ability to form a homogeneous interactive mixture. Thus, the aim of this thesis was to understand the impact of the cohesion of small binder particles on their interactive mixing behaviour and consequently extension of their potential excipient performance i. e., binder and flow additive actions. A model pharmaceutical binder, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was co-sprayed with L-leucine to <b>engineer</b> small low-cohesion <b>binder</b> particles. In these composite particles, L-leucine enriched at the surfaces and manipulated the surface physico-chemical properties (such as morphology, surface energy and its crystalline character), which allowed control over cohesion. Low cohesion small binder particles de-agglomerated efficiently and formed a more homogeneous interactive mixture with paracetamol (active pharmaceutical ingredient, API) compared with high cohesion binder particles. The homogeneous interactive mixing allowed small binder particles to express enhanced binder and flow additive actions. The flow additive action improved while inherent binder activity reduced with reducing cohesion. This decline in binder activity was attributed to the reduction in the compactability (or bonding ability) of binder particles. However, manipulation of mechanical properties (increasing plastic deformability) allowed improvement of the binder activity of such low cohesion binder particles. High performance excipients are necessary to facilitate direct compression of high-dose APIs. Our study showed that binder and flow additive action are mutually exclusive excipient properties and the knowledge of interactive mixing allowed creation of composite excipients with elements of both flow additive and binder action. Manipulation of the surface physico-chemical and mechanical properties via smart particle engineering enabled small binder particles to express an optimum flow additive and binder performances. Thus, this knowledge could enable rational engineering and development of high-performance direct compression excipients, which would enable direct compression of poorly compactable and poorly flowable high-dose APIs. ...|$|R
40|$|Use of Permeable Paving Systems (PPS) in road {{transport}} networks {{has been gaining}} more attention due to benefits such as minimising surface run-off, decreasing the risk of flash flooding and reducing pollutants deposited in waterways. Simultaneously the increasing stockpiles of waste tyre and its non-biodegradable nature leading to negative environmental impacts and associated hazards have posed increased attention to seek innovative sustainable solutions for reducing tyre stockpiles. Crumb rubber has enhanced properties that {{allow it to be}} a suitable substitution for rock aggregate in PPS. By using mixtures of tyre and rock aggregates and <b>engineered</b> level of <b>binders</b> the flexibility of PPS can be optimized based on the application to accommodate differential settlements thus reducing degradation and cracking commonly observed in conventional permeable pavement systems. This can ultimately lead to an increase in serviceability and minimising costly maintenance works and more importantly expand the range of applications permeable pavements can be used in. This study reports on the mechanical behaviour of a range of semi-rigid PPS products incorporating tyre crumbs for surface paving with high drainage capability for mitigation of storm-water run-off. The transient stiffness-deformation behaviour of a range of permeable pavement systems with varying tyre crumb content and binder type under variable loadings was investigated. In the first step, different mixing ratios of crushed rocks (rigid aggregate) and tyre crumbs (soft aggregate) were tested in the laboratory to find the optimum mixtures fit for different applications. Constraint modulus and shear wave velocity tests were carried out to establish the mixtures which their performance changes from rigid-type to soft-type with varying pressure level. Results of this step provide an insight into the formation of force chains in the mixtures ultimately providing the most formidable mix ratio resulting in transitional soft to rigid behaviour. In the next step different binder types (polyurethane based) and percentages were added to selected blends to investigate the performance of polymer bonded tyre-rock aggregates under static and dynamic loads. Test results suggest that the quality of binder only shows its impact for tyre contents higher than 30 %. In blends with higher tyre contents the force chains mostly pass through tyre aggregates and hence the deformation of tyre aggregates puts more strain on binder film causing the lower grade binders to fail. Same low grade binders show satisfactory results when tested with mixtures up to 30 % tyre content. Preliminary test results suggest that the optimum mixture of tyre and rock aggregate with the right binder type and ratio can produce a permeable pavement system suitable for car parks and other lightly trafficked areas including pedestrian footpaths.

40|$|With an {{increasing}} {{understanding of the}} molecular bases of disease, macromolecules such as proteins and siRNA can potentially be used as therapeutics, modulating biological function with high specificity to reverse pathological progression. However, while certain contexts require manipulating the biology inside the cell, the large size and charge of macromolecules prevent them from spontaneously crossing the cell membrane. For proteins, this problem limits the scope of diseases that are potentially addressable. For siRNA, this prevents access to the cellular machinery responsible for executing gene silencing in the first place. Thus, a safe and effective method to deliver proteins and siRNA into the cytoplasm is desired to fully enable their therapeutic potential. In this thesis, we describe {{the development of an}} intracellular delivery system based on a bacterial pore-forming protein, and demonstrate its efficacy in vitro using protein and siRNA payloads. Perfringolysin O (PFO) {{is a member of the}} cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) family of bacterial toxins whose pores, reaching up to 30 nm in diameter, allow the passage of large molecules without a specialized transport mechanism. However, the creation of such pores on the cell membrane is accompanied by cytotoxicity, which limits the practical use of these proteins as a delivery tool. Thus, we developed a strategy to selectively activate PFO in endosomal compartments to minimize cytotoxicity. Specifically, we <b>engineered</b> a neutralizing <b>binder</b> against PFO on the fibronection scaffold. The binder was designed to have a higher affinity for PFO at neutral pH, inhibiting pore-formation on the cell membrane, and a lower affinity at acidic pH, promoting pore-formation on endosomal membranes. Fusing this binder to an antibody against EGFR allowed specific targeting and internalization. Using a protein payload-the ribosome-inactivating protein gelonin-administered in trans, we demonstrated that this strategy enables efficient delivery with high specificity and low toxicity, increasing the therapeutic window of PFO by orders of magnitude in vitro. One advantage of this delivery system is its modularity, as the payload administered in trans is readily swappable with other molecules of interest. Thus, we next demonstrated that the neutralized PFObased system can also be used for intracellular delivery of siRNA. For this application, we engineered a targeted siRNA carrier based on the dsRNA-binding protein p 19 of the Carnation Italian Ringspot Virus (CIRV). In particular, we matured the affinity of p 19 to create clones with some of the highest affinities for siRNA reported to date. Higher affinity correlated with higher potency, with the tightest-binding p 19 mutant enabling silencing of a reporter gene with pM concentrations of siRNA in vitro. This increase in potency was partially due to increased uptake of siRNA. However, we also observed that the high-affinity clones enable stronger silencing even When each clone internalizes similar numbers of siRNA. This observation suggests that prolonging the association of siRNA and its carrier inside the cell may be a strategy for further improving the efficiency of silencing. Overall, the work described in this thesis demonstrates how neutralizing binders can be used to control the activity of potent membrane-disrupting agents, to deliver exogenous macromolecules into the cytoplasm with low toxicity. Further optimization of the neutralized PFO-based system for in vivo use will enhance its utility as a viable therapeutic strategy. by Nicole J. Yang. Thesis: Ph.
