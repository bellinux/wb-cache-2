5|$|Struggling with {{injuries}} and motivation issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925, Nurmi found his long-time rivals Ville Ritola and Edvin Wide ever more serious challengers. At the 1928 Summer Olympics, Nurmi recaptured the 10,000 m title but was beaten {{for the gold}} in the 5000 m and the 3000 m steeplechase. He then {{turned his attention to}} longer distances, breaking the world records for events such as the one hour run and the 25-mile marathon. Nurmi intended to end his career with a marathon gold medal, as his idol Kolehmainen had done. In a controversial case that strained <b>Finland–Sweden</b> relations and sparked an inter-IAAF battle, Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council that questioned his amateur status. Two days before the opening ceremonies, the council rejected his entries. Although he was never declared a professional, Nurmi's suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the marathon, all the {{entrants}} of {{the race}} except for the Finns, whose positions were known, filed a petition asking Nurmi's entry to be accepted. Edström's right-hand man Bo Ekelund, secretary general of the IAAF and head of the Swedish Athletics Federation, approached the Finnish officials and stated that {{he might be able to}} arrange for Nurmi to participate in the marathon outside the competition. However, Finland maintained that as long as the athlete is not declared a professional, he must have the right to participate in the race officially. Although he had been diagnosed with a pulled Achilles tendon two weeks earlier, Nurmi stated he would have won the event by five minutes. The congress concluded without Nurmi being declared a professional, but the council's authority to disbar an athlete was upheld on a 13–12 vote. However, due to the close vote, the matter was postponed until the 1934 meet in Stockholm. Finns charged that the Swedish officials had used devious tricks in their campaign against Nurmi's amateur status, and ceased all athletic relations with Sweden. A year earlier, controversies on the track and in the press had led Finland to withdraw from the <b>Finland-Sweden</b> athletics international. After Nurmi's suspension, Finland did not agree to return to the event until 1939.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{struggled}} to maintain motivation for running, heightened by his rheumatism and Achilles tendon problems. He {{quit his job}} as a machinery draughtsman in 1926 and began studying business intensively. As Nurmi started a new career as a share dealer, his financial advisors included Risto Ryti, director of the Bank of Finland. In 1926, Nurmi broke Wide's world record for the 3000 m in Berlin and then improved the record in Stockholm, despite Nils Eklöf repeatedly trying to slow his pace down in an effort to aid Wide. Nurmi was furious at the Swedes and vowed never to race Eklöf again. In October 1926, he lost a 1500 m race along with his world record to Germany's Otto Peltzer. This marked the first time in over five years and 133 races that Nurmi had been defeated at a distance over 1000 m. In 1927, Finnish officials barred him from international competition for refusing to run against Eklöf at the <b>Finland-Sweden</b> international, cancelling the Peltzer rematch scheduled for Vienna. Nurmi ended his season and threatened, until late November, to withdraw from the 1928 Summer Olympics. At the 1928 Olympic trials, Nurmi was left third in the 1500 m by eventual gold and bronze medalists Harri Larva and Eino Purje, and he decided to concentrate on the longer distances. He added steeplechase to his program, although he had only tried the event twice before, the latest being a two-mile steeplechase victory at the 1922 British Championships.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Finland Steamship Company decided to {{construct}} a 5,171 gross register ton ship for the <b>Finland—Sweden</b> service the company operated in collaboration with Steamship Company Bore, Rederi AB Svea, and Siljavarustamo, a joint subsidiary of the three companies. For {{the first time in}} Finland SS Co's history, the new ship was fitted with diesel engines and included side-loadable car deck for 50 cars. Her service speed was planned at , and she was to carry 1000 passengers, 332 of them in two classes with berths and the rest as classless deck passengers.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being the largest and fastest ship of her time, Finnjet is also widely considered {{to have been the}} first genuine cruiseferry. Her cabins were very much ahead of their time for a ferry, it was not until over a decade later when other ferries would match the size and fittings of Finnjet 's cabins. Her restaurants and other services were also superior to other ferries of her time. Finnjet 's influence can be clearly seen on the first genuine cruiseferries built for <b>Finland–Sweden</b> traffic in 1980–81, ships such as MS Viking Song, MS Viking Sally and MS Finlandia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} Silja Line {{can be traced}} back to 1904 when two Finnish {{shipping}} companies, Finland Steamship Company (Finska Ångfartygs Aktiebolaget, FÅA for short) and Steamship Company Bore, started collaborating on <b>Finland–Sweden</b> traffic. The initial collaboration agreement was terminated in 1909, but re-established in 1910. After World War I in 1918 a new agreement was made that also included the Swedish Rederi AB Svea. Originally the collaboration agreement applied only on service between Turku and Stockholm, but was also applied to the Helsinki–Stockholm in 1928. As a precursor to the policies later adopted by Silja Line, each of the three companies ordered a near-identical ship for Helsinki–Stockholm service to coincide with the 1952 Summer Olympics, held in Helsinki. Eventually only Finland SS Co.'s [...] was ready in time for the olympics. At this time the city of Helsinki constructed the Olympia Terminal in Helsinki's South Harbour, that Silja Line's ships still use.|$|E

50|$|In 1957, {{the rally}} {{had a record}} number of entries from foreign {{countries}} and the organisers developed a sign language that marshals could use to communicate with drivers. The event also started the <b>Finland-Sweden</b> international in rallying, comparable to the traditional <b>Finland-Sweden</b> athletics international. Sweden's Erik Carlsson drove his Saab 93 to victory as the first non-Finn. In the 1958 1000 Lakes, documented by a 20th Century Fox film crew, seven drivers crashed out on the same curve on a foggy night. Brothers Osmo and Eino Kalpala took a record third win in an Alfa Romeo Giulietta TI, which marked the first victory for an Italian car.

50|$|Åström {{first became}} Finnish {{champion}} at 200 m in 1921; his time 22.1 {{was better than}} the national record, but was not accepted due to a suspect start. At the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris Åström represented Finland in both the 400 m individual race and the 4 × 400 m relay; he qualified from the heats in the individual race, but did not take part in the second round. During the mid-1920s he was Finland's best at both 200 m and 400 m; he won both events at the inaugural <b>Finland-Sweden</b> Athletics International, held in Helsinki in September 1925. At the longer distance he defeated Sweden's Olympic medalists Erik Byléhn and Nils Engdahl, and his time of 49.0 equalled Erik Wilén's Finnish record.The same year, he first equalled Lauri Härö's Finnish 200 m record of 22.2 and then improved it to 22.1 in Stockholm, this time legitimately.
