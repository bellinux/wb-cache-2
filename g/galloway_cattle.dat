5|$|The Galloway breed {{comes from}} the cattle native to the {{south-west}} region of Scotland, first fully developed in the 17th century. Originally there was much variation within this breed, including many different colours and patterns. The original Galloway herd book only registered black cattle, but the recessive gene for red colour persisted in the population, and eventually dun Galloways were also allowed into the herd book.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to cast fresh light on the {{uprising}} of the Galloway Levellers in 1724. To achieve this objective, the study takes as its starting point patterns of land use and land ownership in Galloway as they evolved through from the late sixteenth to the beginning of the eighteenth century. The important influence of the plantation of Ulster on the development of <b>Galloway's</b> <b>cattle</b> trade is discussed in this part of the study. Since the society of Galloway in 1724 was still deeply influenced by the religious and political conflicts of the later seventeenth century, this background is then considered. Local responses to the Jacobite rebellion of 1715 are discussed within this context since there was an anti-Jacobite element within the rhetoric and actions of the Galloway Levellers. From these foundations, and having established a chronology for the events of 1724, much of the confusion which previously surrounded the actions of the Galloway Levellers and responses to their actions can be clarified. It has been possible to identify and provide a history for most of the people and places involved, including some of the Levellers themselves. This evidence in turn has revealed that the actions of the Galloway Levellers did have an impact on the later eighteenth century development of Galloway through a more cautious approach to agricultural improvement and the creation of industrial settlements to provide employment for surplus labour. Finally, a previously unrecognised connection between late eighteenth century Galloway and the theory and practice of the industrial revolution is explored...|$|R

50|$|Herbivorous megafauna are {{considered}} important tools of nature conservation {{in maintaining the}} biodiversity of open or park-like landscapes without human interference. Therefore, it is planned to reintroduce large game in several reserves to recreate the natural dynamics of the European ecosystems. The aurochs {{was one of the}} most important European ungulates but was hunted to extinction over most of Europe in the Middle Ages. Despite attempts at conservation, the last known pure-bred aurochs died in Jaktor√≥w Forest, Poland in 1627. Thus, so-called rewilding has to work with its domesticated descendants, of which several breeds are hardy and robust enough to fill this gap. In many grazing projects, especially in Germany, Heck cattle are used, together with <b>Galloways</b> and Highland <b>cattle.</b> Heck cattle originated in the 1920s as an attempt by Lutz and Heinz Heck to breed an aurochs look-alike from several cattle breeds. Heck cattle turned out to be a hardy breed, but are found to be considerably different from the aurochs in several aspects.|$|R

50|$|The Shorthorn {{breed of}} cattle {{originated}} in the North East of England in the late 18th century.

50|$|Generally {{speaking}} the Eastern {{half of the}} Machars {{can be described as}} being a landscape of rolling green hills and scattered woodland which forms a perfect setting for the large scale dairy industry which can be found here. In fact up until recent decades a large scale creamery was to be found at Sorbie although this has now closed. This landscape extends to the far southern extremities of the peninsula, however the landscape to the North West is significantly different, where above the raised beaches of Luce Bay a rugged expanse of moorland and bog can be found, more reminiscent of the rough country to the north. The highest point of the Machars can be found here, Mochrum Fell, however {{for the most part the}} terrain can be characterised as a series of low, stony ridges interspersed by large expanses of peat bog and moorland and many small lochs. This part of the Machars is generally associated with large scale forestry plantations, especially of Sitka Spruce, and stock-rearing, either the hardy Belted Galloway or more typically <b>Galloway</b> <b>cattle</b> or sheep.|$|E
50|$|Polled strains {{have been}} {{developed}} of many cattle breeds which were originally horned. This has usually been done by crossing with naturally polled breeds, most commonly Angus and <b>Galloway</b> <b>cattle.</b> For example, polled Jersey cattle originated in Ohio sometime prior to 1895. Two strains were developed, the first to appear being founded by crosses of registered Jersey bulls (the standard) on common muley (hornless) cows. These were graded up by the continued use of purebred Jersey sires, selection being made of the polled offspring of each generation, the horned progeny being discarded. Thus originated what was later known as the single-standard strain. As {{in the case of}} the Polled Shorthorns and Polled Herefords, the development of the single-standard strain was soon followed by the appearance of a double-standard strain, founded by a few naturally hornless sports that were discovered in registered herds of horned Jersey cattle. These standards were bred among themselves or crossed with registered horned Jerseys, followed by selection for the polled head, and the strain was developed in this way.|$|E
5000|$|In 1906, Jones began {{crossbreeding}} cattalo, {{these particular}} buffalo crossbred with <b>Galloway</b> <b>cattle</b> on a government ranch located along the North Rim of the Grand Canyon in the Kaibab Plateau area of northern Arizona. In 1907, Jones introduced the western novelist, Zane Grey (a former dentist), to the Southwest. Grey modeled {{several of his}} characters after Jones, including the central figure in the nonfiction The Last of the Plainsmen. Grey's nonfiction Roping Lions in the Grand Canyon is also based on the author's experiences with Jones. Late in 1909, [...] "Colonel" [...] Jones, as he was then known, persuaded the Massachusetts industrialist Charles S. Bird to finance a game-catching expedition to Kenya. With two cowboys (Marshall Loveless and Ambrose Means), a guide and several porters, Jones traveled to Nairobi. In the savannas of Kenya, they roped warthogs, elands, zebras, a rhinoceros, and a lioness, which lived at a zoo in New York until 1921. Jones also employed two filmographers who documented his activities. He then showed his films across the United States, including a performance at Carnegie Hall in New York City, in which he narrated the highlights of his hunting trip. He was awarded a medal by the British King Edward VII for his efforts to preserve animals. In 1914, Jones organized a second, but unsuccessful, African hunting trip for a gorilla. The failure to capture a huge gorilla created a breach between Jones and his sponsors. While in the Belgian Congo (now Democratic Republic of the Congo), he contracted malaria, was placed on a stretcher, and evacuated on the last departing boat, just as World War I was declared in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Potter {{had been}} a disciple of the land {{conservation}} and preservation ideals of her long-time friend and mentor, Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, the first secretary and {{founding member of the}} National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. She supported the efforts of the National Trust to preserve not just the places of extraordinary beauty but also those heads of valleys and low grazing lands that would be irreparably ruined by development. She was also an authority on the traditional Lakeland crafts, period furniture and stonework. She restored and preserved the farms that she bought or managed, making sure that each farm house had in it a piece of antique Lakeland furniture. Potter was interested in preserving not only the Herdwick sheep, but also the way of life of fell farming. In 1930 the Heelises became partners with the National Trust in buying and managing the fell farms included in the large Monk Coniston Estate. The estate was composed of many farms spread over a wide area of north-western Lancashire, including the Tarn Hows. Potter was the de facto estate manager for the Trust for seven years until the National Trust could afford to buy most of the property back from her. Her stewardship of these farms earned her wide regard, but she was not without her critics, {{not the least of which}} were her contemporaries who felt she used her wealth and the position of her husband to acquire properties in advance of their being made public. She was notable in observing the problems of afforestation, preserving the intake grazing lands, and husbanding the quarries and timber on these farms. All her farms were stocked with Herdwick sheep and frequently with <b>Galloway</b> <b>cattle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The White Park is a medium-large, long-bodied bovine. A {{program of}} linear assessment, {{including}} 200 bulls and 300 cows, {{has been carried}} out in the UK since 1994 to define its size and conformation. The weight of a mature bull varies from 800 to 1000 kg, depending on the quality of grazing, while adult cows are typically 500 to 700 kg. Their coloration is a distinctive porcelain white with coloured (black or red) points. The horns of the cows can vary in shape, but the majority grow forwards and upwards in a graceful curve. The horns of the bulls are thicker and shorter. In their native environment in Britain, White Park cattle are known for their distinctive appearance and their grazing preference for coarse terrain. White Park cattle are well-suited to non-intensive production. Some herds are kept outside throughout the year on rough upland grazing without shelter or supplementary feed. They are docile, easy-calving, and have a long productive life. Some traits may vary depending on their location.Until recently, White Park cattle were a triple-purpose breed used for meat, milk and draught. The 3rd Lord Dynevor (1765-1852) kept a team of draught oxen, and the practice continued up to 1914. They were used as dairy cattle even more recently. Some cows were being milked in the Dynevor herd in 1951, but yields were moderate. Beef became the main product during the twentieth century, and gained a reputation as a textured meat, with excellent flavor and marbling, which commanded a significant premium in specialty markets. [...] The white park, a breed I‚Äôve never eaten before and had always assumed was purely ornamental, was really excellent: softly chewy, with that strong, distinctive, almost corrupt flavour of proper beef A.A. Gill Several blood typing and DNA studies have revealed the genetic distinctness of White Park cattle.
