40|$|Abstract: Surface {{property}} plays a {{very important}} role on coal hydrophobicity which determines flotation behavior <b>of</b> fine <b>coals.</b> However, coal spontaneous combustion makes coal suffer both oxidation and high temperature heating processes. Coals from the outside <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> piles primarily suffer oxidation (or combustion process) while coals from the inside <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> piles primarily suffer high temperature heating process. It is necessary to investigate the changes in surface <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> before and after high temperature heating process.

Spontaneous combustion liability index and intrinsic <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>coals</b> and coal-shales varies between (above and below) coal seams.

Comparative {{analysis of the}} relationships between the spontaneous combustion liability index and intrinsic <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> <b>coals</b> and coal-shales were established to evaluate their effects on self-heating potential. The intrinsic properties show linear relationship with spontaneous combustion liability and therefore, identifies the factors affecting spontaneous combustion of these materials.

Both coals and coal-shales show inertinite maceral as major constituents than the vitrinite and liptinite macerals, hence the reactivity of inertinite macerals may show greater influence on spontaneous combustion liability.

Coupling supercell periodic calculations under the density functional theory formalism with a nonempirical quasi-harmonic Debye model, we examine the influence of temperature on the relative stability of several cation distributions of Co 2 + and Al 3 + over tetrahedral and octahedral interstices of the oxygen sublattice. Our simulations are able to reproduce the experimentally observed trend: (i) the normal spinel is calculated to be the stable structure at static and low-temperature conditions, and (ii) as the temperature increases, the preference of structures with Al 3 + at tetrahedral sites (and Co 2 + at octahedral sites) is found to progress following an asymptotic conduct.
