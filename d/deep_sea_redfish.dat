In the <b>deep</b> <b>sea,</b> {{although most of the}} <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> is under pressures between 200 and 600 atm, the range of pressure is from 20 to 1,000 atm.

Until recently, people lacked detailed information on the direct effects of pressure on most deep-sea organisms, because virtually all organisms trawled from the <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> arrived at the surface dead or dying.
