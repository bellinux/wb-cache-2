The abortion definition and its types, necessary for exact delimitation of the topic, are introduced. Then actual legislation and data gathering of <b>induced</b> abortion are provided. The work focuses on the analysis of regional {{differentiation of}} <b>induced</b> abortions in the Czech Republic. The work includes graphs of some statistical indicators of <b>induced</b> abortions in the Czech Republic in 2011. It mainly focuses on pattems of <b>induced</b> abortions in individual regions, according to number of previous live-born babies to mothers who underwent the <b>induced</b> abortion, marital status and education level of these women. Methods of demographic analysis and statistical methods are used (<b>induced</b> abortions to live birth ratios, total <b>induced</b> abortions rate, women's average age at <b>induced</b> abortion). Working hypotheses are presented and consequently verified. Cluster analysis on the regional scale was applied to make the <b>induced</b> abortion patterns more transparent and easier to interpret.

In the first part, approaches to <b>induced</b> abortion are discussed and development in abortion law is described, in the second part, trends of <b>induced</b> abortion are analysed over time and by age of woman. As a tool, methods of demographic analysis of <b>induced</b> abortion and some statistical methods are applied. <b>Induced</b> abortions from other than health reasons are currently legally permitted in 25 of 28 analysed countries. Significant differences among developed countries not only in quantum of <b>induced</b> abortion but also in the structure of <b>induced</b> abortion by the age of woman were found by the analysis. Besides the law of <b>induced</b> abortions, the most important factor for indicators of <b>induced</b> abortions is prevalence of modern contraception methods. With the spreading difference of their use, the difference among countries in <b>induced</b> abortion decrease. Keywords: <b>induced</b> abortion, law, abortion rate, developed countrie...|$|R
