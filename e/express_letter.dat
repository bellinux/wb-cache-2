25|$|About 1pm, as Drake moved sluggishly {{out across}} Belfast Lough, {{a small boat}} came out to her, {{carrying}} another volunteer, Royal Navy Lieutenant William Dobbs, a local man who had just gotten married. According to Drake pilot {{he brought with him}} a copy of an <b>express</b> <b>letter</b> from Whitehaven, explaining the full details of the mystery ship (Jones states in his official report that the news from Whitehaven had arrived the previous evening and was known to his morning captives). With the wind and tide more favourable in the afternoon, Ranger moved slowly back out of the Lough into the North Channel, making sure never to get too far ahead of Drake. Finally, about 6pm, the two enemies were within hailing distance. Jones had the American naval colours flying, and Lieut. Dobbs' formal inquiry as to the ship's identity was answered with absolute truth.|$|E

6000|$|But it is said, {{that the}} {{legislature}} was not bound by this article, as {{it has never been}} ratified in Parliament. I do admit that it never had that sanction, and that the Parliament was under no obligation to ratify these articles by any express act of theirs But still I am at a loss how they came to be the less valid, on the principles of our Constitution, by being without that sanction. They certainly bound the king and his successors. The words of the article do this, or they do nothing; and so far as the crown had a share in passing those acts, the public faith was unquestionably broken. In Ireland such a breach {{on the part of the}} crown was much more unpardonable in administration than it would have been here. They have in Ireland a way of preventing any bill even from approaching the royal presence, in matters of far less importance than the honor and faith of the crown and the well-being of a great body of the people. For, besides that they might have opposed the very first suggestion of it in the House of Commons, it could not be framed into a bill without the approbation of the Council in Ireland. It could not be returned to them again without the approbation of the King and Council here. They might have met it again in its second passage through that House of Parliament in which it was originally suggested, as well as in the other. If it had escaped them through all these mazes, it was again to come before the Lord Lieutenant, who might have sunk it by a refusal of the royal assent. The Constitution of Ireland has interposed all those checks to the passing of any constitutional act, however insignificant in its own nature. But did the administration in that reign avail themselves of any one of those opportunities? They never gave the act of the eleventh of Queen Anne the least degree of opposition in any one stage of its progress. What is rather the fact, many of the queen's servants encouraged it, recommended it, were in reality the true authors of its passing in Parliament, instead of recommending and using their utmost endeavor to establish a law directly opposite in its tendency, as they were bound to do by the <b>express</b> <b>letter</b> of the very first article of the Treaty of Limerick. To say nothing further of the ministry, who in this instance most shamefully betrayed the faith of government, may it not be a matter of some degree of doubt, whether the Parliament, who do not claim a right of dissolving the force of moral obligation, did not make themselves a party in this breach of contract, by presenting a bill to the crown in direct violation of those articles so solemnly and so recently executed, which by the Constitution they had full authority to execute? ...|$|E

They tried to follow the IND system of single-letter expresses and double-letter locals, but the system began to break down under the complex BMT routings. Where on the IND a local simply doubled the <b>express</b> <b>letter</b> (A Eighth Avenue Express, AA Eighth Avenue Local), some lines had multiple local services with different routings. For instance the two Brighton Local services, one via the Manhattan Bridge and the other via the Montague Street Tunnel, were designated QB and QT respectively. The TA had no specific lettering plan for the two Wall Street special rush-hour services, so it just designated these M (Nassau Street Express) temporarily, a letter reserved for use on the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line's Nassau Street service.|$|E

A detailed structural evolution of the magnetization is presented {{as a function of the}} applied current density.

40|$|Reverberant sound {{fields are}} often modeled as isotropic. However, {{it has been}} {{observed}} that spatial properties change during the decay of the sound field energy, due to non-isotropic attenuation in non-ideal rooms. In this letter, a model for the spatial coherence between two sensors in a decaying reverberant sound field is developed for rectangular rooms. The modeled coherence function depends on room dimensions, surface reflectivity and orientation of the sensor pair, but is independent of the position of source and sensors in the room. The model includes the spherically isotropic (diffuse) and cylindrically isotropic sound field models as special cases. Comment: Accepted for JASA <b>Express</b> <b>Letter...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{charge-coupled}} device (CCD) {{is a standard}} imager in optical region in which the image quality is limited by its pixel size. CCDs also function in X-ray region but with substantial differences in performance. An optical photon generates only one electron while an X-ray photon generates many electrons at a time. We developed a method to precisely determine the X-ray point of interaction with subpixel resolution. In particular, we found that a back-illuminated CCD efficiently functions as a fine imager. We present here the validity of our method through an actual imaging experiment. Comment: 7 pages, 2 figures.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the MT data, which show no evidence of electrical anisotropy, recent seismic data from the NoMelt experiment presented a strong anisotropy in the upper mantle.

However, this is not related to the anisotropy found in the seismic data at upper and mid-lithosphere depths. Seismic anisotropy at this depth is not expected to generate measurable MT data.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduced}} an image stitching algorithm {{which is based}} on ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature and RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm. First, we use ORB feature and brute force algorithm to find correspondences between images. Second, we apply the RANSAC algorithm to estimating homography robustly. Finally, the algorithm blends the images according to the homography and the image feathering algorithm was engaged to remove the visible seams due to exposure differences. From the results of experiments, we can draw a conclusion that the algorithm we proposed can stitch images seamlessly with a low computation time. © 2016, ICIC <b>Express</b> <b>Letters</b> Office.
