40|$|The {{intrinsic}} birefringences of TMV, tropocollagen, and paramyosin {{were calculated}} from flow birefringence measurements using {{the theory of}} Peterlin and Stuart. The values are - 0. 029, - 0. 029, and - 0. 030, respectively. The intrinsic birefringences of TMV and tropocollagen were measured {{as a function of}} the refractive index of the solvent in glycerol-water mixtures. In both cases the values were not constant and became less negative as the refractive index increased. Theoretical calculations showed that the large solvent effect could not be caused by a hydration shell of index different from that of the bulk solvent. It is concluded that either (a) the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringence</b> calculated from the Peterlin-Stuart theory is incorrect or (b) the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringence</b> depends markedly on the solvent. These results are of importance to the problem of quantitative polarized light microscopy since the separation of form and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringence</b> contributions is based on the assumption that <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringence</b> is independent of solvent...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{results of}} a recent study done in Norway from Bergen University, to determine temperature dependence of linear birefringence in mineral oil and linear and induced birefringence in vegetable oils. The study was done between the temperature range of 6 and 45 ºC in magnetic field up to 140 mT. It found the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringences</b> responsible for optical activity in vegetable oils with impurities and all mineral oils. The results of optical activity in both oils obeyed the equation f = A + aw (1) where aw is the angle at which minimum irradiance Imin occurs in water and other substances which are optically inactive. Heavy oils like red diesel, Esso diesel and Fina diesel No. 2 rotate more the vibration plane and they possess more <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringences</b> than light diesel. The research team found that the temperature effect on rotation in both mineral and vegetable oils with impurities, yielded results that obeyed the equation f 1 = A - bT (3) where b is positive. In vegetable oils for human consumption, application of magnetic field causes induced birefringences responsible for f given by f 2 = VHL + aw (4) where V is Verdet’s constant in rad T- 1 m- 1 and H is the magnetic field intensity in Am- 1. Also the temperature dependence on rotation in vegetable oils free from impurities obeyed the relationship given by equation = VHL–bT (5).

In solvents with a refractive index close to the particle refractive index, the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringence</b> of the platelets dominates, resulting in positive birefringence, while if the solvent has a considerably different refractive index, birefringence due to the anisometric particle shape wins over the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringence,</b> resulting in negative birefringence.

Analysis of myofibrils at various stages of shortening has produced results fully consistent with the sliding filament theory of contraction. On a weight basis, the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringence</b> of thick-filament protein is about 2. 4 times that of thin-filament protein.

40|$|The {{birefringence}} {{properties of}} single-mode optical-fibre waveguides are discussed. A fibre birefringence measurement {{system has been}} developed specifically to measure the birefringence of fibres {{as a function of}} temperature, wavelength, twist and bending. By incorporating a birefringence modulator into the system, the measurement speed and sensitivity is substantially increased, particularly for low birefringences. The fibre spinning technique has been invented to provide a means of manufacturing ultra-low birefringence fibres with extremely high yield. It is shown that spinning averages the <b>intrinsic</b> local <b>birefringence</b> to produce very low overall retardation. A coupled-mode analysis to describe the birefringence properties of spun and twisted fibres is developed and confirmed experimentally. It is now possible to manufacture ultra-low birefringence fibres routinely. The coupled-mode analysis is subsequently extended to treat the effects of bending, twist and magnetic fields on both linearly- and circularly-birefringent fibres. The predictions are subsequently confirmed experimentally and a thorough understanding of extrinsic effects on fibre birefringence has been established. The design criteria of polarisation maintaining fibres are discussed. A novel technique is also described for the measurement of polarisation mode-dispersion, based on the variation of birefringence with wavelength. The dramatic reduction of polarisation-dispersion achieved by spinning is demonstrated, thereby indicating the high suitability of spun fibres to high-bandwidth communications. The separate identification of the stress and waveguide effects contributing to the <b>intrinsic</b> fibre <b>birefringence</b> has been achieved by observing the changes in birefringence as a function of wavelength and temperature...|$|R

The birefringence in solvents of varying index calculated from the Peterlin-Stuart theory using this value of the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringence</b> {{did not agree with}} experimental values. Considerations of polydispersity and shear deformation indicated that the discrepancy could not be attributed to these effects. Also it could not be explained in terms of specific solvent effects.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{differential}} group delay (DGD) due to polarization mode dispersion (PMD) can be effectively reduced by spinning the fiber during drawing. In this paper, we propose an analytical approach that allows optimization of the spinning design. The fundamental idea is that, {{in the absence of}} polarization coupling, an optimized spinning profile can balance the effects of the <b>intrinsic</b> linear <b>birefringence</b> so that the differential group delay can be forced to be periodic and, consequently, have a limited amplitude as a function of distance. Our approach Is independent of the spin profile. In other words, with a fixed set of parameters that characterize a particular spin function, we are able to find analytically the values corresponding to a periodic DGD in a deterministic regime. Numerical results based on waveplate model confirm the analytical prediction and show that PMD can be reduced by about two orders of magnitude with respect to the same fiber without spinning, even after the introduction of random polarization couplin...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new instrument that can measure fast transient birefringence and polymer chain orientation angle in complex fluids. The instrument uses a dual-crystal transverse electro-optic modulator with the second crystal's modulation voltage applied 180 deg out of phase {{from that of the}} first crystal. In this manner, the second crystal compensates for the <b>intrinsic</b> static <b>birefringence</b> of the first crystal, and it doubles the modulation depth. By incorporating a transverse electro-optic modulator with two lithium-niobate (LiNbO 3) crystals oriented orthogonal to each other with a custom-designed optical system, we have produced a very small robust instrument capable of fast transient retardation measurements. By measuring the sample thickness or optical path length through the sample, we can calculate the transient birefringence. This system can also measure dichroism. We have compared the calibration results and retardation and orientation angle measurements of this instrument with those of a photoelastic modulator (PEM) based system using a quarter wave plate and a high-precision 1 / 16 -wave plate to simulate a birefringent sample. Transient birefringence measurements on the order of 10 (exp - 9) can be measured using either modulator...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the electro-optic response of a suspension of disk-like colloids. We have considered aqueous suspensions of Gibbsite platelets and measured the electrically induced birefringence {{in the broad}} frequency range 10 (2) - 10 (8) Hz. When simply dispersed in an electrolyte solution, these particles orient with their major axis parallel to the electric field at all frequencies. The spectral dependence of their Kerr coefficient features three regimes: an electrokinetic α-relaxation within the kHz range, a conductive Maxwell-Wagner-O'Konski (MWO) relaxation having characteristic frequency in the 1 - 10 MHz range, and a nonzero high frequency asymptote. We quantitatively analyze the MWO spectral component and the high-frequency asymptote {{on the basis of}} a model developed for oblate particles. This analysis enables us to obtain the relevant particle properties: surface conductivity, zeta potential, and <b>intrinsic</b> Gibbsite <b>birefringence.</b> When the particles are dispersed in a mixture that also contains smaller spherical particles that have a charge of the same sign, their electric birefringence becomes negative at low frequency. This anomalous orientation of the platelets is analogous to that observed in mixtures of prolate and spherical particles, and demonstrates the anomalous birefringence as a universal property of suspensions of nonspherical particles when surrounded by smaller charged particle...|$|R
40|$|In this work, hyperbranched {{polymers}} {{of different}} molecular weights and different molecular architectures have been simulated using a coarse-grained model and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics techniques. A number of structural parameters and the rheology of hyperbranched polymer melts under shear were analysed {{to explain the}} effect of the molecular structure and molecular weight on microscopic as well as macroscopic properties. In order to determine the shear-induced changes in the structural properties of hyperbranched polymers, various parameters were calculated at different strain rates. The radii of gyration which characterize the size of the polymer were evaluated. The relationship between the zero shear rate mean squared radius of gyration and the molecular weight as well as the Wiener index was established. The tensor of gyration was analysed and results indicate that hyperbranched polymer molecules have a prolate ellipsoid shape under shear. As hyperbranched polymers have compact, highly branched architecture and layers of beads have increasing densities which might lead to an unusual distribution of mass, the distribution of beads was also studied. The distribution of terminal beads was investigated to understand the spatial arrangement of these groups which is very important for hyperbranched polymer applications, especially in drug delivery. Flow birefringence was characterized by taking into account both form and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringences</b> which result from molecular and bond alignment respectively. The melt rheology of hyperbranched polymer structures with different molecular weights and different number of spacers was also studied. Systems were simulated over a wide range of strain rates to capture the crossover behaviour from Newtonian to non-Newtonian regimes. Rheological properties including the shear viscosity and first and second normal stress coefficients were computed and the transition to shear thinning was observed at different strain rates for hyperbranched polymers of different sizes and topologies. The results were consistent with findings from NEMD simulations of linear and dendritic polymers. The stress-optical rule was tested and shown to be valid only in the Newtonian regime and violated in the strong flow regime where the rule {{does not take into account}} flow-induced changes of the micro structure. The stress-optical coefficient was found to be independent of the molecular weight and topology of polymers. Blends of hyperbranched polymers and linear polymers were also simulated and their rheological properties were investigated. Results show that even a small proportion of hyperbranched polymer in a melt of linear chains can reduce the shear viscosity of the whole system. This feature makes hyperbranched polymers a potential candidate as rheology modifiers. However there is no observed limit in the proportion of hyperbranched polymers in the samples above which the viscosity is stabilized. The viscosity drops continuously, correlating with the amount of hyperbranched polymers present...|$|R
40|$|Isolated mitotic {{apparatuses}} (MA) of clam and {{sea urchin}} eggs were investigated by polarizing and electron microscopy. Examination of fixed MA in oils of different refractive index revealed {{that at least}} 90 % of the retardation of isolated MA is due to positive, form birefringence, the remaining retardation deriving from positive, <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringence.</b> Electron micrographs reveal the isolated MA to be composed of microtubules, ribosome-like particles, {{and a variety of}} vesicles. In the clam MA the number of vesicles and ribosome-like particles relative to the number of microtubules is much lower than in the sea urchin MA. In clam MA this allows form and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringence</b> to be related directly to microtubules. The relation of birefringence to microtubules in isolated sea urchin MA is more complex since ribosome-like particles adhere to microtubules, are oriented by them, and are likely to contribute to the form birefringence of the isolated MA. However, comparison of values of retardation for clam and sea urchin MA, indicates that the major part of the birefringence in sea urchin MA is also due to microtubules. The interpretation of the structures giving rise to birefringence in the MA of the living cells is likely to be even more complex since masking substances, compression, or tension on the living MA may alter the magnitude or sign of the birefringence...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of a spinning step in the drawing process is known to improve optical-fiber polarization mode dispersion. For a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism through which spinning modifies fiber performances, in this paper, the authors investigate the effect of unidirectional spinning on local fiber birefringence {{in terms of the}} effectiveness of spin-function transfer and reduction of the local <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringence</b> under different drawing conditions. The actual frozen-in spin is experimentally recovered by means of a cut-back procedure. Different from the case of a periodic spinning, a unidirectional spinning correctly reproduces the nominally imparted spin rate in agreement with theoretical modelizations of the transfer effectiveness of the spinning process. A theoretical explanation for the experimental evidence, recently proved by tomographic stress measurements, of spinning affecting fiber linear <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringence</b> is provided. In particular, the interaction of drawing parameters and spinning process in defining stress development into fibers is considered. To validate the proposed model, further tomographic reconstructions of stress profiles in fiber spun at different rates and drawing speed were carried out. Besides, corresponding stress-induced birefringence values were estimated and compared with those recovered by the cut-back technique. Variations of spun fiber beatlength values with respect to the unspun case, as obtained from both measurement techniques, are in good agreement, providing a further reliable confirmation that an improvement of the beatlength may proceed {{as a consequence of the}} applied spi...|$|E

Analyzing various fibers with this method, we rind that phase and group birefringence can be quite different for certain fiber types.

40|$|During {{the past}} few years, a strong {{progress}} has been made in the photo-writing of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) in polymer optical fibers (POFs), animated by the constant wish to enhance the grating reflectivity and improve the sensing performances. In this paper, we report the photoinscription of highly reflective gratings in step-index POFs, obtained thanks to a slight etching of the cladding. We demonstrate that a cladding diameter decrease of ∼ 12 % is an ideal trade-off to produce highly reflective gratings with enhanced axial strain sensitivity, while keeping almost intact their mechanical resistance. For this, we make use of Trans- 4 -stilbenemethanoldoped photosensitive step-index poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) POFs. FBGs are inscribed at ∼ 1550 nm by the scanning phase mask technique in POFs of different external diameters. Reflectivity reaching 97 % is achieved for 6 mm long FBGs, compared to 25 % for non-etched POFs. We also report that a cladding decrease enhances the FBG axial tension while keeping unchanged temperature and surrounding refractive index sensitivities.

40|$|Faraday-effect optical-fibre current sensors have {{a number}} of {{well-known}} advantages for use in high-voltage transmission systems and other hostile environments. However, these applications have been restricted by the presence of linear birefringence in the fibre which adversely interacts with the Faraday polarisation rotation produced by magnetic fields. Linear birefringence results from (a) intrinsic effects within the fibre (ellipticity, inbuilt thermal-stress) and (b) packaging and coiling which introduces transverse pressure and bends. The first of these can be eliminated by spinning a moderately-birefringent conventional fibre during the draw to produce a fibre with negligible <b>intrinsic</b> linear <b>birefringence.</b> However, the fibre remains just as sensitive to externally-induced birefringence caused by coiling. A complete solution to this problem is to design fibres with a large circular birefringence which overwhelms the perturbations caused by linear birefringence and thus permits the full Faraday rotation to be observed. Helical fibres have this property, but are large in diameter which restricts their application to coils of about 15 cm radius. Moreover, care is required in launching and splicing. We report here an alternative approach which appears particularly suited to applications requiring multi-turn, small-diameter coils. A highly-birefringent Bow-Tie fibre is rapidly spun during the draw to produce a fibre which exhibits a large elliptical birefringence. Unlike the unspun Bow-Tie fibre, the fibre now exhibits a magnetic field sensitivity. In addition, just as in a normal birefringent-fibre, the fibre is resistant to polarisation mode-coupling effects and therefore the current sensitivity is largely unaffected by packagin...|$|R

Rotation of polarization may also occur {{in the absence of}} any intrinsic or stress induced birefringence, if the fiber is bent into a nonplanar curve. Such rotation depends purely on the path of the fiber and is therefore known as geometric or topological rotation of polarization. An experiment was carried out to measure this geometric rotation of polarization by laying the fiber in different helical paths. Measurements of polarization rotation were made for each of twelve different fiber helices. A personal computer was used for experimental control and data acquisition. The theory of the geometric rotation of polarization can be explained using classical electrodynamics, and an independent quantum mechanical treatment based on Berry's topological phase.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Microcirculation {{refers to}} the {{functions}} of capillaries and the neighboring lymphatic vessels. It plays {{a vital role in}} the pathophysiology of disorders in many clinical areas including cardiology, dermatology, neurology and ophthalmology, and so forth. It is crucial to develop imaging technologies that can provide both qualitative and quantitative information as to how microcirculation responds to certain injury and/or disease, and its treatment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive optical imaging technique for high-resolution cross-sectional imaging of specimens, with many applications in clinical medicine. Current state-of-the-art OCT systems operate in the Fourier domain, using either a broadband light source with a spectrometer, known as spectral domain OCT (SDOCT), or a rapidly tunable laser, known as swept source OCT (SSOCT). The current Fourier domain OCT systems have dramatically improvement in sensitivity, resolution and speed compared to time domain OCT. In addition to the improvement in the OCT system hardware, different methods for functional measurements of tissue beds have been developed and demonstrated. This includes but not limited to, i) Phase-resolved Doppler OCT for quantifying the blood flow, ii) OCT angiography for visualization of microvasculature, iii) Polarization sensitive OCT for measuring the <b>intrinsic</b> optical property/ <b>birefringence</b> of tissue, iv) spectroscopic OCT for measuring blood oxygenation, etc. Functional OCT can provide important clinical information that is not available in the typical intensity based structural OCT images. Among these functional OCT modalities, Doppler OCT and OCT angiography attract great interests as they show high capability for in vivo study of microvascular pathology. By analyzing the Doppler effect of a flowing particle on light frequency, Doppler OCT allows the quantification of the blood flow speed and blood flow rate. The most popular approach for Doppler OCT is achieved through analysis of the phase term in complex OCT signal which termed as Phase-resolved Doppler OCT. However, as limited by the phase noise and motion, Phase-resolved Doppler OCT can only be applied for relative large blood vessels, such as arterioles and venules. On the other hand, in order to visualize the microcirculation network, a number of strategies to enable better contrast of microvasculature components, which we termed OCT angiography, have been introduced during recent years. As a variation of Fourier domain OCT, optical microangiography (OMAG) is one of earliest proposed OCT angiography technique which is capable of generating 3 D images of dynamic blood perfusion distribution within microcirculatory tissue beds. The OMAG algorithm works by separating the static and moving elements by high pass filtering on complex valued interferometric data after Fourier transform. Based on the conventional OMAG algorithm, we further developed ultra-high sensitive OMAG (UHS-OMAG) by switching the high-pass filtering from fast scan direction (adjacent A-lines within one B-frame) to slow scan direction (adjacent B-frames), which has a dramatically improved performance for capillary network imaging and analysis. Apart from the microvascular study with current available functional OCT for, visualization of the lymphatic system (lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels) plays a significant role in assessing patients with various malignancies and lymphedema. However, {{there is a lack of}} label-free and noninvasive method for lymphangiography. Hence, a cutting edge research to investigate the capability of OCT as a tool for non-invasive and label-free lymphangiography would be highly desired. The objective of my thesis is to develop a multiple-functional SDOCT system to image the microcirculation and quantify the several important parameters of microcirculation within microcirculatory tissue beds, and further apply it for pre-clinical research applications. The multifunctional OCT system provides modalities including structural OCT, OCT angiography, Doppler OCT and Optical lymphangiography, for multi-parametric study of tissue microstructure, blood vessel morphology, blood flow and lymphatic vessel all together. The thesis mainly focus on two parts: first, development of multi-functional OCT/optical microangiography (OMAG) system and methods for volumetric imaging of microvasculature and quantitative measurement of blood flow, and its application for pathological research in ophthalmology on rodent eye models; second, development of ultra-high resolution OCT system and algorithm for simultaneous label free imaging of blood and lymphatic vessel, and its application in wound healing study on mouse ear flap model. Objectives of my research are achieved through the following specific aims: Aim 1 : Improve the sensitivity of OMAG for microvasculature imaging; perform volumetric and quantitative imaging of vasculature with combined OMAG and Phase-resolved Doppler OCT for in vivo study of vascular physiology. Aim 2 : Develop high speed high resolution OCT system and method for rodent eye imaging. Apply the combined OMAG and Phase-resolved Doppler OCT approach to investigate the impact of elevated intraocular pressure on retinal, choroidal and optic nerve head blood flow in rat eye model, which aids to the better understanding of the mechanism and development of glaucoma. Aim 3 : Apply the developed OCT system and ultra-high sensitive OMAG algorithm for noninvasive imaging of retinal morphology and microvasculature in obese mice, which may play an important role in early diagnosis of Diabetic retinopathy. Aim 4 : Developing an ultra-high resolution SDOCT system using broadband Supercontinuum light source to achieve ultra-high resolution microvasculature imaging of biological tissue. Aim 5 : Develop methods for simultaneous label free optical imaging of blood and lymphatic vessel and demonstrate its capability by monitoring the blood and lymph response to wound healing on mouse ear pinna model...|$|R

We also report new measurements of two sets of mirrors that confirm that mirror phase retardation per reflection decreases when mirror reflectivity increases. We finally developed a computational code to calculate the expected phase retardation per re°ection {{as a function of the}} total number of layers constituting the mirror. Different cases have been studied and we have compared computational results with the trend of the experimental data. Our study indicates that the origin of the mirror <b>intrinsic</b> <b>birefringence</b> can be ascribed to the re°ecting layers close to the substrate...|$|E
