25|$|In 1689, Denis Papin had {{suggested}} that the pressure and fresh air inside a diving bell could be maintained by a <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> or bellows. His idea was implemented exactly 100 years later by the engineer John Smeaton who built the first workable diving air pump in 1789.|$|E
25|$|Number 2 engine, {{built by}} Harvey and Co. of Hayle in 1846 as a {{double-acting}} Sims patent combined cylinder engine and rebuilt in 1903 to a Cornish Engine, is a single-acting, condensing engine with a bore of 42 inches (1067mm), {{a stroke of}} 7 feet 8 inches (2337mm) and indicated power of 42 horsepower (31kW). It drives a 30-inch (762mm) <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> capable of lifting 2235 pounds (1014kg), or approximately one ton of water, per stroke, {{at a rate of}} 10.2 strokes a minute.|$|E
25|$|Loss of steamboats by collision, fire, or river {{obstacles}} (snags) {{was well}} understood, but boiler explosions seemed arbitrary and mysterious. Immediately {{after the loss}} of the Lucy Walker, many newspapers began to speculate on the cause or causes of the explosion. One paper opined that a faulty <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> and low water level in the boiler was the cause. Another newspaper reported qualms about reckless behavior of the boat's officers or shoddy construction of the boilers. Later there was speculation that steamboat racing might have contributed to the disaster.|$|E

50|$|<b>Force</b> <b>pumps</b> {{could be}} made of either wood or bronze. Based on ancient texts, it seems that bronze was the {{preferred}} material since it lasted longer and was more easily transported. Wood was easier to build, put together, and repair but was not as durable as bronze. Because these were high-value objects, few are found in shipwrecks; they were often recovered after the ship sank. <b>Force</b> <b>pumps</b> were fairly simple in their construction consisting of a cylinder, a piston, and a few valves. Water would fill the cylinder after which the piston would descend into the cylinder, causing the water {{to move to a}} higher placed pipe. The valve would close, locking the water into the higher pipe, and then propelling it in a jet stream.|$|R
50|$|Ctesibius {{described}} one of {{the first}} <b>force</b> <b>pumps</b> for producing a jet of water, or for lifting water from wells, and examples have been found at various Roman sites, such as at Silchester in Britain. The principle of the siphon has also been attributed to him.|$|R
500|$|Aerosmith's next {{album was}} even more successful. Pump, {{released}} in September 1989, featured three Top Ten singles: [...] "What It Takes", [...] "Janie's Got a Gun", and [...] "Love in an Elevator", {{as well as the}} Top 30 [...] "The Other Side", re-establishing the band as a serious musical <b>force.</b> <b>Pump</b> was a critical and commercial success, eventually selling 7 million copies, spawning several music videos that were in regular rotation on MTV, and achieving four-star ratings from major music magazines. Pump ranked as the fourth-bestselling album of 1990. The band also won its first Grammy in the category of Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, for [...] "Janie's Got a Gun". In addition, the video for [...] "Janie's Got a Gun" [...] won two Video Music Awards and was ranked as one of the 100 greatest videos of all time by Rolling Stone, MTV, and VH1. Like Permanent Vacation, Pump was produced by Bruce Fairbairn, who added production touches such as instrumental interludes that provided transitions between songs to give the album a more complete sound, as well as the Margarita Horns, who added horns to tracks such as [...] "Love in an Elevator" [...] and [...] "The Other Side". Rock critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine claimed that Pump [...] "revels in [...] without ever losing sight of Aerosmith's dirty hard rock core", going on to say that, [...] "such ambition and successful musical eclectism make Pump rank with Toys in the Attic and Rocks." [...] The recording process for Pump was documented in the video The Making of Pump, which has since been re-released as a DVD. The music videos for the album's singles were featured on the release Things That Go Pump in the Night, which quickly went platinum.|$|E
2500|$|Based {{on these}} {{descriptions}} and the Byzantine sources, John Haldon and Maurice Byrne designed a hypothetical apparatus as consisting of three main components: a bronze pump, {{which was used}} to pressurize the oil; a brazier, used to heat the oil (πρόπυρον, propyron, [...] "pre-heater"); and the nozzle, which was covered in bronze and mounted on a swivel (στρεπτόν, strepton). The brazier, burning a match of linen or flax that produced intense heat and the characteristic thick smoke, was used to heat oil and the other ingredients in an airtight tank above it, a process that also helped to dissolve the resins into a fluid mixture. The substance was pressurized by {{the heat and the}} usage of a <b>force</b> <b>pump.</b> After it had reached the proper pressure, a valve connecting the tank with the swivel was opened and the mixture was discharged from its end, being ignited at its mouth by some source of flame. The intense heat of the flame made necessary the presence of heat shields made of iron (βουκόλια, boukolia), which are attested in the fleet inventories.|$|E

In the 1970s, a new station containing electric pumps capable of pumping 36,000 gallons per hour was built alongside the Edwardian building but the original engines and pumps have now been restored.|$|R
6000|$|... "We rigged the <b>force</b> <b>pump,</b> got {{the hose}} along, and by-and-by it burst. Well, {{it was as}} old as the ship--a prehistoric hose, and past repair. Then we pumped with the feeble head-pump, drew water with buckets, and in this way managed in time to pour lots of Indian Ocean into the main hatch. The bright stream flashed in sunshine, fell into a layer of white {{crawling}} smoke, and vanished on the black surface of coal. Steam ascended mingling with the smoke. We poured salt water as into a barrel without a bottom. It was our fate to pump in that ship, to pump out of her, to pump into her; and after keeping water out of her to save ourselves from being drowned, we frantically poured water into her to save ourselves from being burnt.|$|E

"Well," [...] {{continued}} Potter, with a {{laugh and}} a nod to his mother, [...] "no doubt Smeaton had a spice of mischief in him among other qualities, for it is said of him that when quite a little fellow he made a <b>force</b> <b>pump,</b> with which he emptied his father's fish-pond of water, to the detriment, not to say consternation, of the fish. The upshot of it all was that the lad was apprenticed to a maker of mathematical instruments, and soon proved himself to be an inventive genius of considerable power. Ere long he commenced business on his own account, and has now undertaken the task of building the third lighthouse on the Eddystone. I was in London lately, and saw the beautiful models of the intended structure which Smeaton has made with his own hands, {{and it seems to}} me that he's just the man to do the work." ...|$|E
6000|$|New {{claims were}} taken up daily, {{and it was}} the {{friendly}} custom to run straight to the newspaper offices, give the reporter forty or fifty [...] "feet," [...] and get them to go and examine the mine and publish a notice of it. They did not care a fig what you said about the property so you said something. Consequently we generally said a word or two to the effect that the [...] "indications" [...] were good, or that the ledge was [...] "six feet wide," [...] or that the rock [...] "resembled the Comstock" [...] (and so it did--but as a general thing the resemblance was not startling enough to knock you down). If the rock was moderately promising, we followed the custom of the country, used strong adjectives and frothed at the mouth as if a very marvel in silver discoveries had transpired. If the mine was a [...] "developed" [...] one, and had no pay ore to show (and of course it hadn't), we praised the tunnel; said {{it was one of the}} most infatuating tunnels in the land; driveled and driveled about the tunnel till we ran entirely out of ecstasies--but never said a word about the rock. We would squander half a column of adulation on a shaft, or a new wire rope, or a dressed pine windlass, or a fascinating <b>force</b> <b>pump,</b> and close with a burst of admiration of the [...] "gentlemanly and efficient Superintendent" [...] of the mine --but never utter a whisper about the rock. And those people were always pleased, always satisfied. Occasionally we patched up and varnished our reputation for discrimination and stern, undeviating accuracy, by giving some old abandoned claim a blast that ought to have made its dry bones rattle--and then somebody would seize it and sell it on the fleeting notoriety thus conferred upon it.|$|E

50|$|Most images {{show only}} the engine side, giving no {{information}} on the pumps. Current opinion is that {{at least on the}} early engines, dead-weight <b>force</b> <b>pumps</b> were used, the work of the engine being solely to lift the pump side ready for the next downwards pump stroke. This is the arrangement used for the Dudley Castle replica which effectively works at the original stated rate of 12 strokes per minute/10 gallons (54.6litres) lifted per stroke. The later Watt engines worked lift pumps powered by the engine stroke {{and it may be that}} later versions of the Newcomen engine did so too.|$|R
5000|$|In 1855 two 0-8-0 {{locomotives}} {{for use in}} the Crimean War, {{capable of}} hauling guns up inclines as steep as 1 in 10, were reputed to have been built with horizontal cylindrical furnaces, rather than rectangular fireboxes, and boilers fed by <b>force</b> <b>pumps.</b> They were described as having outside cylinders driving the third set of wheels, while two pairs of wheels were flangeless.

25|$|This form of {{photophosphorylation}} {{occurs on}} the thylakoid membrane. In cyclic electron flow, the electron begins in a pigment complex called photosystem I, passes {{from the primary}} acceptor to pheophytin, then to cytochrome b6f (a similar complex to that found in mitochondria), and then to plastocyanin before returning to chlorophyll. This transport chain produces a proton-motive <b>force,</b> <b>pumping</b> H+ ions across the membrane; this produces a concentration gradient {{that can be used}} to power ATP synthase during chemiosmosis. This pathway is known as cyclic photophosphorylation, and it produces neither O2 nor NADPH. Unlike non-cyclic photophosphorylation, NADP+ does not accept the electrons; they are instead sent back to cytochrome b6f complex.|$|R
50|$|Ancient bilge force pumps had {{a number}} of common uses. Depending on where the pump was located in the hull of the ship, it could be used to suck in sea water into a live fish tank to {{preserve}} fish until the ship was docked and the fish ready to be sold. Another use of the <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> was to combat fires. Water would again be sucked in through the bottom of the hull, and then pumped onto the blaze. Yet another suggested use for a <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> was to dispel water from a ship. The pump would be placed {{near the bottom of the}} hull so as to suck water out of the ship. Force pumps were used on land as well. They could be used to bring water up from a well or to fill high placed tanks so that water could be pressure pumped from these tanks. These tanks were for household use and/or small-scale irrigation. The <b>force</b> <b>pump</b> was portable and could therefore, as on ships, be used to fight fire.|$|E
