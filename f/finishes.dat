5|$|The 2015 Vuelta {{included}} nine summit <b>finishes,</b> none {{of which}} had previously {{been used in the}} race.

The race organisers also hoped to encourage sprinters to take part by including seven fairly flat stages.|$|E

5|$|As the town, where Hamasaki {{is sitting}} on the bench, starts to rain, the {{atmosphere}} where Hamasaki is the doll starts to rain as well. Just after Hamasaki <b>finishes</b> singing the second chorus, an instrumental break happens and has Hamasaki looking at the now abandoned puppet show. A truck then drives past, which vibrates the puppet show's stage, causing the doll to fall on the ground and its strings become tangled. This happens to Hamasaki as the doll; she faints in the dark atmosphere land, with strings attached to her. Hamasaki, sitting on the bench, starts to cry and sings the remaining of the song. It ends with the taxi driver, who <b>finishes</b> day dreaming about the marionettes dolls, opening the door for Hamasaki to enter.|$|E
