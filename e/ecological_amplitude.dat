In peat-forming habitats major floristic changes followed the extinction. Earliest Stephanian (Late Pennsylvanian) dominance-diversity patterns were highly variable temporally; several different plant groups that were of minor importance in Westphalian mires became major framework dominants, with high coal to coal variability. Ultimately opportunistic tree ferns, previously subdominant, became the dominant elements.

In order to test the influence of ecoregion within Europe, species indicator values of three European macrophyte river trophic indices were compared to each other. Species indicator values of the United Kingdom (UK), French and German bioindication methods are significantly correlated with each other. The most obvious difference between the three indicator systems is the number of included indicator taxa. Two species exhibit major differences in indicator values: Callitriche hamulata has a broader <b>ecological</b> <b>amplitude</b> in Germany and France than in the UK, where it is restricted to oligotrophic rivers, while Ranunculus fluitans has a broad <b>ecological</b> <b>amplitude</b> in the UK, whereas the species is restricted to eutrophic rivers in Germany and France.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ecological {{indicator}} {{values have}} been derived for the vascular plants {{of the southern}} Aegean island arc comprising Kythira, Crete and the surrounding islets, the Karpathos archipelago and Rhodos (Greece). The derivation of these values follows a modified, more objective and more universal Ellenberg approach in evaluating the <b>ecological</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of plants. The evaluation concerns the climatic and edaphic eco-factors light, temperature, continentality, moisture, soil reac-tion, nutrient supply and salt tolerance. Details on indicator value quality are also given. 2442 taxa (species, subspecies and a few varieties) have been classified {{for the first time}} in this manner. The set of variables provides a compact ecological characterization of the floristic elements and brings ecological specialization of plants to an operational mode. Various methods of calculating average indicator values, indicator values spectra and other approaches in combination with plant or vegeta-tion mapping would aid effective site and vegetation classification as well as environmental moni-toring. Indicator values are valid only for the area they are defined for; with the exception of the S Aegean continentality values which are plant specific.

40|$|Testing {{the myriad}} {{predictions}} {{associated with the}} community, demographic and genetic impacts of habitat fragmentation remains a high conservation priority. Many bryophyte taxa are ideal model systems for experimentally testing such metapopulation-based and population genetic predictions due to their relatively fast colonisation-extinction rates, high substrate specificity, dominant haploid condition, and diminutive size. Herein, we review the community, demographic and population genetic impacts of habitat fragmentation on bryophytes, highlight the present knowledge gaps, and offer ideas on how experimental studies utilizing bryophytes {{may be used to}} address the broader conservation implications associated with fragmented ecosystems. Previous research suggests that dispersal limitation best explains observed patterns of abundance and distribution of bryophytes in some fragmented habitats. However, edge effects influence bryophyte community structure of border habitats especially where abrupt differences in micro-climatic conditions between the matrix and the forest remnant exist, or where the species pool contains members with inherently restricted <b>ecological</b> <b>amplitudes.</b> Existing studies do not agree on the relationship between basic attributes of bryophyte community structure (i. e., species richness and local density), and habitat area and degree of spatial-isolation. Demographic studies are a critical step in structuring conservation strategies, however surprisingly little empirical information exists as to the impacts of habitat fragmentation on plant population dynamics. We propose that bryophytes offer great potential for testing predictions with respect to plant population persistence in spatially-structured landscapes...|$|R

However, within Europe, native species may also become invasive. Such species rapidly increase their geographic range and may at the same time broaden their <b>ecological</b> <b>amplitude.</b> We report on Lactuca serriola L., which has shown a rapid range expansion in many parts of Europe. We reconstructed its geographical spread through The Netherlands; furthermore, we tested for changes in its <b>ecological</b> <b>amplitude.</b> Before 1950, L. serriola was rare in The Netherlands, recorded from only 80 grid-cells (of 5 x 5 km(2)). Subsequently, its distribution increased from 219 grid-cells (1980), to 546 cells (990) and 998 grid cells (2000). It currently occupies at least 60 % of The Netherlands. Analyses of relevees demonstrate, using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), that the variance in the assemblage of species co-occurring with L. serriola increased significantly since 1940, indicating that the species currently occurs in a broader range of vegetation types. Correlating averages of Ellenberg's indicator values per vegetation relevee with time, we found correlations for continentality (+), acidity (-) and (soil) humidity (+). Moreover, the proportion of phanerophytes in the relevees increased over time. These findings suggest that in addition to its original ruderal. habitat, L. serriola also currently occurs, in more closed vegetation types. Based on analyses of two other co-occurring Asteraceae species, we showed that these patterns were specific for L. serriola only. We conclude that L. serriola has broadened its <b>ecological</b> <b>amplitude</b> and discuss four mutually non-exclusive explanations for the recent invasiveness of L. serriola: (i) Effects of a changed environment: global. warming and ruderalisation; (ii) metapopulation dynamics and increased diaspore pressure; (iii) microevolution; IN) genetic reinforcement due to hybridisation with conspecific (crop) species...|$|E

A simple weighted averaging (WA) method for estimating these parameters is compared by simulation with the more elaborate method of Gaus-sian logistic regression (GLR), a form of the generalized linear model which fits a Gaussian-like species re-sponse curve to presence-absence data. The indicator value and the <b>ecological</b> <b>amplitude</b> are expressed by two parameters of this curve, termed the optimum and the tolerance, respectively. When a species is rare and has a narrow ecological amplitude- or when the distribution of quadrats along the environmental variable is reasonably even over the species ' range, and the number of quadrats is small- then WA is shown to ap-proach GLR in efficiency. Otherwise WA may give misleading results. GLR is therefore preferred as a practi-cal method for summarizing species ' distributions along environmental gradients.

They are well adapted {{to tolerate the}} physiological stresses imposed by the severe environment. This study investigates aspects of their growth, physiology and survival in response to habitat constraints, especially hydrology. Their distribution is controlled almost exclusively by moisture availability. Each species tends to predominate in a specific zone along hydrological gradients, with B. pseudotriquetrum on moist soil, C. purpureus on drier soil, and B. argenteum on unstable stream margins, fluvial deposits and the marginal capillary zone. Where conditions are optimal, each species can form a turf 6 – 10 cm thick. Nutrient status of the soil {{does not appear to}} be an important determinant in the distribution pattern within communities. The thermal regime of the moss turf varies according to its moisture content; for a period of ca. six weeks during the summer, with the frequent long spells of 24 -h sunshine, temperatures remain above 0 °C for much of the time even though air temperatures are frequently below the freezing point. This allows growth and metabolic activity to proceed continuously at a relatively rapid rate for quite long periods. Annual shoot incremental growth can exceed 3. 5 mm in each species. Growth of B. argenteum may be inhibited by UV- B radiation. The optimal temperature for photosynthesis in each species is around 15 °C, but significant carbon fixation occurs at 5 °C.

40|$|Quercus robur L. (pedunculate oak) and Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. (sessile oak) are two European oak {{species of}} great {{economic}} and ecological importance. Even though both oaks have wide <b>ecological</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of suitable growing conditions, forests dominated by oaks {{often fail to}} regenerate naturally. The regeneration performance of both oak species {{is assumed to be}} subject to a variety of variables that interact with one another in complex ways. The novel approach of this research was to study the effect of many ecological variables on the regeneration performance of both oak species together and identify key variables and interactions for different development stages of the oak regeneration on a large scale in the field. For this purpose, overstory and regeneration inventories were conducted in oak dominated forests throughout southern Germany and paired with data on browsing, soil, and light availability. The study was able to verify the assumption that the occurrence of oak regeneration depends on a set of variables and their interactions. Specifically, combinations of site and stand specific variables such as light availability, soil pH and iron content on the one hand, and basal area and species composition of the overstory on the other hand. Also browsing pressure was related to oak abundance. The results also show that the importance of variables and their combinations differs among the development stages of the regeneration. Light availability becomes more important during later development stages, whereas the number of oaks in the overstory is important during early development stages. We conclude that successful natural oak regeneration {{is more likely to be}} achieved on sites with lower fertility and requires constantly controlling overstory density. Initially sufficient mature oaks in the overstory should be ensured. In later stages, overstory density should be reduced continuously to meet the increasing light demand of oak seedlings and saplings...|$|R

This mire type is distributed further to the east than previously reported, namely around the highest post-glacial limit of the sea level. Calluna vulgaris, Narthecium ossifragum, Erica tetralix, Molinia caerulea, Carex panicea and Sphagnum spp. or, e. g., Campylium stellatum and Calliergonella cuspidata were prominent, mainly forming a mire lawn vegetation. Four community types can be distinguished, {{each with its own}} characteristic environmental variables. Three vegetation gradients are evident. The first, a poor - rich one, is correlated with pH, the second is a slope gradient, and the third, a mire expanse - spring fen gradient, was revealed by the species composition. In the habitat studied, the characteristic lawn vegetation acts as an indicator of its specifically soligenous water supply. Interactions between vascular plants and Sphagnum are concluded to be less important than those between hepatics and other bryophytes, which appear with several positive or negative associations. Narthecium ossifragum supports the growth of Sphagnum, whereas the vascular plant suffers from the competition for light with the peat mosses. The intensity of this competition may be higher at sites more favourable to N. ossifragum. However, interactions between the vascular plant and Sphagnum are less important to structuring vegetation than edaphic factors, particularly on less productive sites. Similar to other plant taxocenes, mire hepatic species highly vary in their <b>ecological</b> <b>amplitudes</b> and preferences. Hepatics make use of the mire habitat with two different strategies. Some species, e. g. Aneura pinguis and Cladopodiella fluitans, compromise between benefiting habitats created by other living bryophytes and keeping pace with their growth. Other hepatics, e. g. Calypogeia integristipula and Cephalozia connivens, instead avoid growing among mosses and frequently occupy peat or litter. Mostly sterile Cephalozia spp. frequently grow among Sphagnum, whereas those commonly fertile keep away from peat mosses...|$|R

Since dry grasslands have a very wide <b>ecological</b> and {{geographical}} <b>amplitude</b> they are able to inhabit many environments, which allow them to be suitable study objects for understanding biodiversity patterns. Most dry grasslands are located in Northern America and Europe. Dry grasslands are widespread in Alaska and northern Canada in cold and dry climates. They are also present in nearly all European regions, other than the Far North. Many different types of environments are able to support the growth of dry grasslands, so it is possible for them to be found all over the world. Despite this, they are rarely found on flat areas.|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} impact of {{environmental}} change on biological communities knowledge about species-environment relationships is indispensable. Ecologists attempt to uncover the relationships between species and environment from data obtained from field surveys. In the survey, species are scored on their presence or their abundance at each of several sampling sites and environmental variables that ecologists believe to be important are measured. The research that led to this thesis aimed to unravel the assumptions required for the application of statistical methods that are popular among ecologists to analyse such data. From a statistical point of view, species data are difficult to analyse:- there are many species involved (10 - 500),- many species occur at a few sites only. So the data contain numerous zeroes,- relations between species and environmental variables are not linear, but unimodal: a plant, for example, preferably grows under for that species optimal moisture conditions and is encountered less frequently at drier or wetter sites. A mathematical model for a unimodal relationship is the Gaussian response model. Standard statistical methods such as linear regression, principal components analysis and canonical correlation analysis are often inappropriate for analysing species data because they are based on linear relationships. One of the methods that ecologists use instead is correspondence analysis. This thesis contributes {{to the understanding of the}} underlying response model. With correspondence analysis, species and sites are arranged to discover the structure in the data (ordination) and the arrangement is subsequently related to environmental variables. It is an indirect method to detect relations between species and environment, hence R. H. Whittaker's term "indirect gradient analysis". Correspondence analysis has been invented around 1935 but did not receive interest from ecologists before 1973 when M. O. Hill derived the technique once more as the repeated application of "weighted averaging" - a method that was familiar to ecologists ever since 1930. Weighted averaging has the advantage of being simple to apply. The method can be used for two different aims: (1) to estimate the optimum of a species for an environmental variable and (2) to estimate the value of an environmental variable at a site from known optima of the species present (calibration). In chapter 2, estimating optima by weighted averaging is compared with the results of non-linear regression on the basis of the Gaussian response model. Under particular conditions, both methods agree precisely. In other cases, weighted averaging gives a biased estimate of the optimum and non-linear regression is the method to be preferred. An additional advantage of non-linear regression is that it can also be used to fit response models with more than one environmental variable. In chapter 3, weighted averaging to estimate the value of an environmental variable is compared with calibration on the basis of the Gaussian response model. Also in this context the techniques are sometimes equivalent. Chapter 4 deals with correspondence analysis. It is shown that, under particular conditions, correspondence analysis approximates ordination on the basis of the Gaussian response model, which is computationally much more complicated. To detect relations, indirect methods have an important disadvantage. The impact of some environmental variables on the species composition can be so large that the impact of other interesting environmental variables may fail to be detected. This problem can be overcome by using non-linear regression, but with many species and environmental variables this is laborious. In chapter 5, a simpler "direct" method is proposed, canonical correspondence analysis. In chapter 6, canonical correspondence analysis turns out to be a multivariate extension of weighted averaging. The results can be displayed graphically. In chapter 7, an extension with "covariables" is discussed, which leads to partial canonical correspondence analysis. Chapter 7 also shows that Gaussian models and, hence, canonical correspondence analysis are relevant to the analysis of contingency tables. Chapter 8 describes a study to estimate <b>ecological</b> <b>amplitudes</b> of plant species with respect to Ellenberg's moisture scale from species data alone. The question that is addressed as well, is how consequent Ellenberg's moisture indicator values are. Finally, chapter 9 cross-tabulates various gradient-analysis techniques by the type of problem (regression, calibration, ordination, etc.) and the response model (linear or unimodal). Furthermore, improvements are proposed for detrended correspondence analysis. A computer program, named MOM is written which can perform most of the methods discussed. ...|$|R
