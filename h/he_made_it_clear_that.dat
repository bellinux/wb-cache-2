5|$|The Colts {{placed their}} {{franchise}} tag on Manning on February 15, 2011. On July 30, 2011, the Colts signed Manning to a 5-year, $90 million contract after negotiations in which <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{he did not}} need to be the highest-paid player in the NFL.|$|E
5|$|Following his conviction, Brady {{was moved}} to Durham Prison, where he asked to live in solitary confinement. He spent 19 years in {{mainstream}} prisons before being diagnosed as a psychopath in November 1985 {{and sent to the}} high-security Park Lane Hospital, now Ashworth Psychiatric Hospital, in Sefton; <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he never wanted to be released.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Brigade {{moved up}} to the line to relieve the 2nd and Rifle Brigades and {{remained}} there until the division was withdrawn to a training area in late October, following the relief of II ANZAC Corps by the Canadian Corps. The division suffered heavy losses on 12 October: about 845 men were killed and a further 1,900 wounded in the worst defeat in New Zealand military history. Although Russell blamed himself for {{the outcome of the}} attack and wrote to politicians in New Zealand stating so, in his private correspondence <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> planning and preparation by Godley and his staff at II ANZAC Corps was inadequate and did {{not take into account the}} poor ground conditions at Passchendaele.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, in {{response}} to the wave of anti-German feeling that surrounded the war, George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. He also disposed of his family's German titles and styles, so Christian, Helena and their daughters simply became Prince and Princess Christian; Princess Helena Victoria and Marie Louise with no territorial designation. Helena's surviving son, Albert, fought {{on the side of the}} Prussians, though <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he would not fight against his mother's country. In the same year, on 8 October, Prince Christian died at Schomberg House. Her last years were spent arguing with Commissioners, who tried to turn her out of Schomberg and Cumberland Lodge because of the expense of running her households. They failed, as clear evidence of her right to live in those residences for life was shown.|$|E
25|$|While Luther did {{not deny}} the Pope’s right to grant pardons for penance imposed by the Church, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> preachers who claimed indulgences absolved those who {{obtained}} them from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error, in agreement with Catholic theology.|$|E
25|$|Repnin's Sejm marked {{one of the}} {{important}} milestones in increasing Polish dependence on the Russian Empire, and its devolution into a protectorate. This dependent position was bluntly spelled out in Nikita Ivanovich Panin's letter to King Poniatowski, in which <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Poland was now in the Russian sphere of influence.|$|E
5|$|Brandan Schieppati's podcast <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> {{the final}} shows were very {{emotional}} {{and he realized}} how well they all played together. He said something may come from the band in the future.|$|R
50|$|James {{was arrested}} and charged that day with 11 counts of aggravated homicide. He refused to answer {{questions}} asked by the police and was very uncooperative. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>he</b> would plead insanity.|$|R
5000|$|Eric Von Haessler {{was fired}} from the show on September 30, 2013. Co-host Larry Wachs posted on Twitter saying that <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> to fans that this was management's {{decision}} and not his.|$|R
25|$|Gold {{resigned}} from the Communist Party on August 24, 1950, and signed the Taft-Hartley oath. However, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he had resigned only so the Fur Workers could receive the protection of federal law. The Justice Department argued that Gold had not really resigned, and indicted him for perjury in August 1953 one day before {{the statute of limitations}} ran out.|$|E
25|$|On 1 December 1971, Vice Admiral Nilakanta Krishnan briefed Captain Inder Singh, the {{commanding}} officer of , that a Pakistani submarine had been sighted off the Sri Lankan coast and was absolutely certain that the submarine would be somewhere around Madras or Visakhapatnam <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> once Rajput had completed refueling, she must leave the harbor with all navigational aids switched off.|$|E

50|$|The {{political}} {{heat was}} {{turned up on}} the issue since Bush mentioned changing Social Security during the 2004 elections, and since <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> in his nationally televised January 2005 speech {{that he intended to}} work to partially privatize the system during his second term.|$|R
50|$|Wattis was {{homosexual}} in an {{era when}} this was a taboo subject; unusually, in his role as Northbrook in The Prince and the Showgirl by gay playwright Terence Rattigan, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> near the beginning of the film that he is attracted to the title character.|$|R
25|$|On 5 February 2008, Romário {{announced}} his retirement both from playing and coaching, effective {{at the end of}} March. This move came somewhat unexpectedly, as fans anticipated that he would retire from playing, but not coaching. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he will only concentrate on the FIFA Confederations Cup and helping with the 2014 FIFA World Cup. However, on 27 March, Romário denied that he had retired.|$|E
25|$|Grey set {{an example}} and a {{precedent}} for his successors. He was primus inter pares (first among equals), as Bagehot said in 1867 of the Prime Minister's status. Using his Whig victory as a mandate for reform, Grey was unrelenting {{in the pursuit of}} this goal, using every Parliamentary device to achieve it. Although respectful toward the King, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> his constitutional duty was to acquiesce to {{the will of the people}} and Parliament.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Church's aim was {{not merely}} to help the {{faithful}} make due satisfaction for their sins, but chiefly {{to bring them to}} greater fervour of charity. For this purpose he decreed that partial indulgences, previously granted as the equivalent of a certain number of days, months, quarantines (forty-day periods) or years of canonical penance, simply supplement, and to the same degree, the remission that those performing the indulgenced action already gain by the charity and contrition with which they do it.|$|E
2500|$|This break also {{marked the}} end of Burnham's {{participation}} in the radical movement, however. On May 21, 1940, he addressed a letter to the National Committee of the Workers Party resigning from the organization.

50|$|In 1925, {{continuing}} {{his role as}} deputy, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> his interest in abandoning active politics.

As a consequence of the 28 May 1926 Revolution, he was forced to abandon politics and retreated into private life.|$|R
50|$|In January 2008, David Roche {{stepped down}} as C.E.O. of Borders (UK) and was {{replaced}} by the chain's former managing director, Philip Downer.

25|$|On October 31, 2009, Cardinal Levada {{responded to}} {{speculation}} that the rule whereby in some Eastern Catholic Churches ordination to the diaconate and priesthood is open to married men {{as well as to}} celibates will apply also to the personal ordinariates for former Anglicans. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the canonical discipline of the Western Catholic Church applies to these ordinariates. Objective criteria for circumstances in which a dispensation from celibacy may be requested will be worked out jointly by the personal ordinariate and the episcopal conference.|$|E
25|$|Five {{years after}} the trial, former Lord Advocate, Lord Fraser, who issued the arrest {{warrants}} in 1991, was alleged to have {{said that he was}} not entirely happy with the evidence presented against Megrahi during his trial in 2000, and in his subsequent appeal in 2002. However, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> this did not mean that he believed Megrahi to be innocent. According to The Sunday Times of 23 October 2005, Lord Fraser allegedly cast doubt upon the reliability of the main prosecution witness, Tony Gauci.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he also {{intended}} {{to argue against}} {{the suppression of the}} American Communist Party, and to use the committee as a platform for a call to transform World War II into a world revolution. Many of his supporters argued against his appearance. When the committee learned the nature of the testimony Trotsky {{intended to}} present, it refused to hear him, and he was denied a visa to enter the United States. On hearing about it, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union immediately accused Trotsky of being in the pay of the oil magnates and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Michael VIII {{summoned the}} Jewish leaders in his realm and {{invited them to}} support him as emperor. Thus Michael's first act toward the Jews [...] was the {{revocation}} of John Vatatzes's order of forced baptism.

50|$|Ruth Ellis, {{the last}} {{woman to be}} {{executed}} in Britain, {{for the murder of}} her lover. Executed at Holloway Prison on 13 July 1955.

5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> when <b>he</b> said [...] "My {{people and}} I would never {{agree with the}} cession of Sarawak to the British Crown!...We cherish the {{independence}} of this state where we were born...""Saya dan rakyat tidak bersetuju dengan penyerahan Sarawak kepada Tanah Jajahan Mahkota British!...Saya dan rakyat mencintai kemerdekaan negeri ini, tanah tumpah darah saya..." ...|$|R
25|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I Martin enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 12 April 1915, against the wishes of his family. His parents finally agreed however when <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he would sign on under an assumed name and never write to them {{if they did not}} consent. He gave a false date of birth to the recruiting officer, claiming to be 18, when he was actually 14 years and three months. His father had earlier tried to enlist but had been rejected as being too old. Martin joined the 1st Reinforcements of the 21st Battalion as a private and trained in Broadmeadows and Seymour (later Puckapunyal) camps in Victoria before boarding HMAT Berrima in June 1915 to deploy to Egypt, arriving there in late July.|$|E
25|$|Isabella was {{at first}} {{unprepared}} for the lavish style of court life in Burgundy, {{one of the most}} extravagant in Europe. The Portuguese infanta, described by the Burgundian embassy that had negotiated her marriage as appearing to their eyes as a nun when they had first met, and now dressed in loose clothing and flat over-panels to hide her pregnancy, looked particularly dowdy at her new court. More upsetting to Isabella, however, was her husband's behaviour. He had showered gifts on her when she had first arrived, and still more when she had become pregnant; yet, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{he had no intention of}} keeping his vows of fidelity and chastity. He kept numerous women as his lovers, most living away from the court, and as many as 50 illegitimate children.|$|E
25|$|Believing {{that the}} lack of a {{suitably}} high test platform was partially to blame for his failures, Reichelt repeatedly petitioned the Parisian Prefecture of Police for permission to conduct a test from the Eiffel Tower. He was finally granted permission in early 1912, but {{when he arrived at the}} tower on 4 February <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he intended to jump himself rather than conduct an experiment with dummies. Despite attempts by his friends and spectators to dissuade him, he jumped from the first platform of the tower wearing his invention. The parachute failed to deploy and he crashed into the icy ground at the foot of the tower. Although it was clear that the fall had killed him, he was taken to a nearby hospital where he was officially pronounced dead. The next day, newspapers were full of the story of the reckless inventor and his fatal jump – many included pictures of the fall taken by press photographers who had gathered to witness Reichelt's experiment – and a film documenting the jump appeared in newsreels.|$|E
5000|$|In February, 1927, Weston {{visited the}} studio of local Carmel artist Henrietta Shore and noticed several {{paintings}} {{she had made}} of sea shells. Only one of these paintings is known to still exist (as of January, 2011), and it shows a stark and solitary nautilus on a dark field, not unlike Weston's resulting photographs. <b>He</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> in his writings that the paintings {{had a profound effect}} on him: ...|$|R
5000|$|While at Nevilles Wellington {{issued a}} general {{order in which}} <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> to those under his command: that their {{respective}} Sovereigns are the Allies of His Majesty the King of France; and that France ought, therefore, {{to be treated as}} a friendly country. It is therefore required that nothing should be taken, either by officers or soldiers, for which payment is not made. Wellington, at Nevilles (20 June 1815).|$|R
25|$|He soon {{proved himself}} capable of scoring goals at that level, and {{attracted}} interest from several bigger clubs. Disappointed when Crewe rejected an offer for him from West Ham United, <b>he</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> {{to the club}} {{that he wanted to}} leave, and reluctantly the club made him available for transfer. In February 1998 Adebola was signed by manager Trevor Francis for fellow First Division club Birmingham City for a fee of £1 million.|$|R
