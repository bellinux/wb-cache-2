40|$|The {{quantity}} and variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) {{is one of}} the most important indices to determine the effect of land use changes on the soil quality. Regarding long-term changes from rangeland to <b>dry</b> <b>farming</b> in the Roin area of North Khorasan, the objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of long-term land use changes on the SOC in different slope faces and use SOC as an index to make a proper decision about the future of land use in this area. 140 soil samples were taken from 0 - 15 cm soil depth of back slope position of north-, south-, west- and east-facing slopes of rangeland, <b>dry</b> <b>farming,</b> alfalfa <b>dry</b> <b>farming</b> and garden in 7 points. 14 soil samples were taken from irrigated farming, too. The results showed that garden and irrigation farming with averages of 2. 03 and 0. 78 % have the maximum and minimum SOC content. The average of SOC content in rangeland was 1. 40 % that decreased by land use change to 1. 04 and 1. 27 % in <b>dry</b> <b>farming</b> and alfalfa <b>dry</b> <b>farming,</b> respectively. SOC content in southern slope aspects showed a significant difference compared to other slope aspects. The most SOC content occurred in east aspects. It seems that after long-term land use changes, the SOC content have equilibrated to environmental and land use conditions. The average SOC content in different slope aspects except south one changed from 1. 4 % in rangeland to 1. 11 % in <b>dry</b> <b>farming</b> and 1. 32 % in alfalfa <b>dry</b> <b>farming,</b> which are a suitable value for semiarid regions. In conclusion, to protect land from degradation and considering this fact that <b>dry</b> <b>farming</b> is the main income of the people in the study area, it is recommended to stop <b>dry</b> <b>farming</b> on south aspects and continue on east, north and west aspects with conservation practices...|$|R

40|$|Classification and {{utilization}} of lands {{based on their}} capability are necessary for sustainable land use management. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify and grade the effective qualities on the rainfed farming in the Roin area, North Khorasan province, during the year of 2011. Based on field observations and literature review the land qualities including climate, rooting conditions, moisture availability, field workability and land degradation hazard were distinguished and rated as the most effective factors on the rainfed land suitability. To evaluate the land degradation hazard, the variations of soil organic carbon content in north-, south-, west- and east-facing slopes as a result of land use change was measured. In seven sites, 84 soil samples were taken from 0 - 15 cm soil depth of Back Slope with aspect of north- south- west- and east-facing slopes of rangeland, wheat <b>dry</b> <b>farming</b> and alfalfa <b>dry</b> <b>farming.</b> In addition, 21 soil samples were taken from nearly flat areas (Toe slopes and back slopes) of studied land uses. The results indicated that all aspects except the south-face slopes the amount of soil organic carbon suitable for semiarid regions. In the study area, the climate and qualities related to soil, have no limitations for <b>dry</b> <b>farming.</b> Only field workability and land degradation hazard qualities which are affected by slope and slope aspect are main limitation factors. Based on results the slopes more than 20 % and the southern slopes were identified non-suitable for <b>dry</b> <b>farming</b> but the southern slopes were partly suitable for alfalfa <b>dry</b> <b>farming.</b> Considering the mentioned limitations, the areas under <b>dry</b> <b>farming</b> cultivation will be decreased from 1186 to 942 ha.

40|$|Improper {{management}} of watershed land utilization has many ill {{effects on the}} available resources. Land use optimization {{is one of the}} proper strategies to achieve sustainable development and to reduce resource dissipation. Focusing on Brimvand watershed in Kermanshah province which comprises an area of 9572 ha, the present study was conducted to find out the most suitable land allocation to different land uses viz. garden, irrigated <b>farming,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>farming</b> and rangeland to achieve soil erosion minimization and benefit maximization. The soil erosion, net benefit and standard land capability maps were supposed as the inputs of the objective functions and to defined constraints. The multi-objective linear problem was then solved using simplex method with the help of ADBASE software package and ultimately the optimal solution was gained. Additionally, {{the results of the study}} revealed that the amount of soil erosion could reduce by 7. 78 % whereas the benefit increases at the rate of 118. 62 %, in case of implementation of optimal solution. The above mentioned optimization led to <b>dry</b> <b>farming</b> decrease and garden increase over that area. The results of sensitivity analysis also showed that objective functions were strongly susceptible to the variation of maximum constraint of irrigated farming and garden areas...|$|R

40|$|Analysis and {{evaluation}} of land use patterns are of prime importance for natural resources management. Recent studies on land use allocation have been mainly based on linear programming optimization. Although these methods {{have the ability to}} solve multi-objective problems, spatial aspects of optimization are not considered when they are used for land use management. This study applied the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to optimize land-use allocation in the Taleghan watershed, northwest of Karaj, Iran. The four land use classes of irrigated <b>farming,</b> <b>dry</b> <b>farming,</b> rangeland, and other uses were extracted from the ETM+ image. The objective functions of the proposed model were erosion, economic return, suitability, and compactness-compatibility. A novel crossover operator called exchange randomly block (ERB) was used to exchange information between individuals. Results showed that the optimization model can find a set of optimal land use combinations in accordance with the proposed conditions. For comparison purposes, land use allocation was also done using the combined goal attainment-multi-objective land allocation (GoA-MOLA) approach.
