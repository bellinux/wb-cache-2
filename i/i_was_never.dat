5|$|I'd {{done a lot}} {{of videos}} and wasn't always a hundred percent thrilled. For the most part, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> thrilled with the results, so I figured I would give {{directing}} a shot. It was a pretty simple concept. Most of the scenes were featured at the amusement park, at a late-night outdoor celebration. I was really happy to be able to include O.D.B in the remix video.|$|E
25|$|As in many {{non-standard}} dialects, double negatives are common, e.g. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> {{scared of}} nobody.|$|E
25|$|In Nashville, I {{was running}} eight miles a day, {{hanging out with}} my friends, walking around eating chocolate-chip cookies and playing a lot of drums, which I enjoyed. Life was easy. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> {{frustrated}} – even though I wasn't fulfilling my contract obligations. If you are failing in Nashville, at least your standard of living is nice. Nashville is {{a nice way to}} fail.|$|E
60|$|SERGIUS (with {{measured}} emphasis, folding his arms). <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> sorry.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> bored anywhere; being bored is {{an insult}} to oneself.|$|R
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Thanks. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> {{going to}} try to harm Robert Chiltern again.|$|R
25|$|Sure, {{there have}} been controversies as well. Naya Daur (right) was one instance, thanks to the Madhubala episode. She was a fine person, it was merely that in this one instance, things went badly wrong. For my film she did about ten days work and then her father refused {{to allow her to}} go {{outdoors}} {{for the rest of the}} shoot - <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> sure why. So we took Vyjayanthimala for the role and her father filed a suit against us.|$|E
500|$|Turner had a {{very close}} {{relationship}} with her only daughter, Cheryl (b. 1943). As a teenager, Cheryl came out as a lesbian {{to her mother and}} father, Steve Crane; reflecting on it, Cheryl recalled: [...] "I always felt I had the full support of my parents... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> made to feel that it was anything strange." ...|$|E
500|$|Ike {{also claimed}} {{on more than}} one {{occasion}} that he and Tina weren't even legally married. In the 1985 Spin article, Ike said, [...] "As God is my judge, of all my wives, Tina is the only one <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> legally married to." [...] He explained in later years that Tina took his name in order to discourage a former lover from returning to her.|$|E
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> {{going back}} to them. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to live among these people. I will marry among them.|$|R

6000|$|... "After all," [...] Kendricks said, [...] "you were of {{the same}} kidney--a prig of the first water, you know, Julien. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> tired of telling you so, <b>am</b> <b>I?</b> <b>Never</b> mind, it's good for you. Have you seen Herr Freudenberg this week?" ...|$|R
500|$|Meany, in {{opposition}} to Lewis and other left-wing union leaders, replied that he would [...] "go further and sign an affidavit that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> a comrade to the comrades" [...] since he had always ostracized communists. Within a year, most US union leaders unaffiliated with the Communist Party signed the affidavit, later upheld by the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1949 that the Communist Party was unique among American political parties in swearing allegiance to a foreign power.|$|E
500|$|Cliff Richard as Cliff Richard Jr. Contracted in Portugal, {{where he}} owned a house [...] "next-door-but-one" [...] to Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, after {{negotiations}} with his agent, Peter Gormley, singer Richard says of his casting that he was [...] "thrilled" [...] {{to be part of}} the well-known and popular Thunderbirds franchise. Richard has fond memories of the making of his Supermarionation lookalike puppet: [...] "It was quite a hoot... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> really sure if I looked like my puppet or it looked like me." ...|$|E
500|$|Although he socialized {{with his}} {{teammates}} and sometimes gambled, Sunday {{was never a}} heavy drinker. In his autobiography, he said, [...] "I never drank much. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> drunk but four times in my life. ... I {{used to go to}} the saloons with the baseball players, and while they would drink highballs and gin fizzes and beer, I would take lemonade." [...] Following his conversion, Sunday denounced drinking, swearing, and gambling, and he changed his behavior, which was recognized by both teammates and fans. Shortly thereafter, Sunday began speaking in churches and at YMCAs.|$|E
6000|$|... 'May be, {{or may not}} <b>be.</b> If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a short-tongued fellow, it may {{amount to}} the same thing. Now, Lammle, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> going to answer questions.' ...|$|R

500|$|Riefenstahl heard Nazi Party (NSDAP) leader Adolf Hitler {{speak at}} a rally in 1932 and was mesmerized by his talent as a public speaker. Describing the {{experience}} in her memoir, Riefenstahl wrote, [...] "I had an almost apocalyptic vision that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> able to forget. It seemed as if the Earth's surface were spreading out in front of me, like a hemisphere that suddenly splits apart in the middle, spewing out an enormous jet of water, so powerful that it touched the sky and shook the earth".|$|E
500|$|Jovovich {{attended}} {{public schools}} in Los Angeles, becoming fluent in English in three months. In school, she was teased by classmates for coming from the Soviet Union: [...] "I was called a commie and a Russian spy. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never,</b> ever, ever accepted into the crowd." [...] At age 12, Jovovich left seventh grade to focus on modeling, which she had started at age nine. She has said she was rebellious during her early teens, engaging in drug use, shopping mall vandalism, and credit-card fraud. In 1994, she became a naturalized U.S. citizen {{at the age of}} 19.|$|E
500|$|On September 9, the Brewers {{became the}} third team {{in major league}} history to start a game with three {{straight}} home runs, as Rickie Weeks, J. J. Hardy, and Braun homered in consecutive at bats. [...] Braun said, [...] "That was pretty cool. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> part of something like that before." [...] Braun's home run in that game also broke the Brewers rookie record for home runs (28). Braun hit his 30th homer in his 94th game, a pace no player had set to start a career since McGwire hit 30 in 84 games during 1986 and 1987.|$|E
6000|$|... "Buns!" [...] she answered. [...] "You {{must not}} think that because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a girl <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> hungry. It <b>is</b> two o'clock, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{positively}} famished. <b>I</b> sent my maid for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You look surprised, sir. Is {{it because}} I {{publicly}} take under my protection a figure like this? But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> ashamed of honesty, whatever his coat." ...|$|R
60|$|ANN. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> hypocritical with you, Jack. Are you angry? [She withdraws the boa {{and throws}} it on a chair]. Perhaps I shouldn't have done that.|$|R
500|$|In 1960, the RAF {{contacted}} Stanley and {{the idea}} of restoring the murals was brought up. He was initially reluctant to return to restore his works due to the painful memories of war and captivity the murals would bring back to him: [...] "I didn't immediately want to come. I felt that there would be some sort of... trauma. I'm trying to forget this, you know, I tried so hard... It took years really to eliminate the memories and fears... the long drawn out experience and really waiting for death over three and a half years, it's long time to expect death. And I really tried to forget... But of course <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> able to do that." ...|$|E
500|$|Enlisting {{former slaves}} in the {{military}} was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to Andrew Johnson, the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him {{to lead the way}} in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, [...] "The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers {{on the banks of the}} Mississippi would end the rebellion at once". By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General Lorenzo Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley. Frederick Douglass once observed of Lincoln: [...] "In his company, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color".|$|E
500|$|An on- and {{off-road}} {{version of}} the Super Cub, what today would be classed as a dual-sport motorcycle but called a trail bike at the time, the CA100T Trail 50, came out in 1961. Jack McCormack, the first national sales manager of American Honda Motor Company, said the Trail 50, {{and even more so}} the later Honda CB77, was the result of Honda's willingness to listen to and respond customer demand. [...] "When you talk about Japanese manufacturers, their strength (besides the quality of their equipment) was that they listened to the marketplace. People always suggest that it was about Japanese management, but, to be frank, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> impressed with Japanese management. They did what no other motorcycle make did—they listened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Mr. Delafield, it <b>is</b> seldom that <b>I</b> have an {{opportunity}} of hearing soft things, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> alone with a gentleman in my father's house"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Esther, my dearest," [...] she said, {{breaking}} silence, [...] "Richard <b>is</b> <b>never</b> so {{well and}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> so easy about him as when he is with Allan Woodcourt. We have {{to thank you for}} that." ...|$|R
6000|$|AND yet all {{the while}} you are you, you are not me. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>I,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> you. How awfully {{distinct}} and far off from each other's [...] being we are! ...|$|R
500|$|O'Meagher Condon's {{address to}} the court was {{considered}} by The Times to have [...] "excelled all the other convicts in his zeal for the Fenian cause". He admitted to having organised {{the attack on the}} police van in his role as leader of the north-west section of the movement, but claimed that he [...] "never threw a stone or fired a pistol; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> at the place ... it is all totally false". He {{went on to say that}} [...] "had I committed anything against the Crown of England, I would have scorned myself had I attempted to deny it". Towards the end of his speech he shouted, [...] "God save Ireland!", a cry taken up by his companions in the dock.|$|E
500|$|... "I've {{considered}} [...] for two years, and in {{the last}} six months, it's seemed real clear to me. I realized that my job would become my career if I stayed. Some people stay with a series until the end, you know, and afterwards they often have some problems, I think, finding new opportunities. And I wanted a career after Dallas. There's great sadness in leaving my friends and the show – <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> bored with it – but I'm not at all ambivalent about this. I'm realistic about taking care of myself financially. I didn't want to walk away blindly without plans. My plans are set. I have a project with a network that is ready to go that I can't talk about yet. It's a drama mystery." ...|$|E
500|$|Welch {{emphasizes}} {{music from}} a previous era as her major influence. [...] She said that [...] "by and large I listen {{to people who are}} dead. I'm really of the tried-and-true school. I let 50 years go by and see what's really relevant." [...] Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, the Louvin Brothers, and the Blue Sky Boys. She explained her relationship with traditional music by saying, [...] "I've never tried to be traditional. It's been a springboard for me and I love it and revere it and would not be doing what I do without the music of the Monroe Brothers, the Stanley Brothers and the Carter Family. However, it was clear <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> {{going to be able to}} do exactly that; I'm a songwriter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For to-day, I have, my friend. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> fatigued. <b>I</b> shall come to {{you again}} in your regular order," [...] {{returned}} Mrs. Pardiggle with demonstrative cheerfulness.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He knows <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> alone, {{and such}} an {{opportunity}} would not easily occur again. Perhaps {{he thought they}} could avoid you two, or even murder you as well.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I {{have grown}} lazy," [...] said Margaret, [...] "for I don't mind those things now. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> sorry {{for a quiet}} time to {{recollect}} and consider." ...|$|R
