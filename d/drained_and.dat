5|$|Starting in 1914, {{the lower}} {{course of the}} Don River was altered to improve flood management, however the new course caused more {{pollution}} to flow into the bay near the Ashbridges' land. In 1923, the bay was <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> filled to create industrial land, using fill dredged from the Toronto Harbour. The home which was once next to the shore was now located some distance away from the water.|$|E
5|$|The first {{segments}} of road {{appeared in the}} location of what would become RE11 by 1940. The southern road segment began at an at-grade intersection, near the location of RE11, and traveled northward, before traveling slightly westward and terminating at a dead end. The road was graded and <b>drained,</b> <b>and</b> had a gravel surface, with a cattle guard near the middle of it. The northern segment of road traveled near the location of RE11. This road was also graded and <b>drained,</b> <b>and</b> had three cattle guards located along its course. By 1951, a gate had {{been added to the}} southern road segment, and the northern segment had several turns straightened and lengthened. On October 28, 1953, RM 2134 was designated from Millersview along a road to the northern segment of what would become RE11. On August 24, 1955, the highway was designated along the northern segment of road, to the Colorado River. The designation was made official on October 1, 1955.|$|E
5|$|Between 1954 and 1962, {{most of the}} {{buildings}} that had been constructed around the tower over the years, including the parliamentary legal offices, a stable, a row of houses and the Prime Minister's chauffeur's house, were demolished, and a new garden, College Green, was laid out beside the tower, {{on top of an}} underground parking lot. The medieval moat was re-excavated in 1956, and filled with water between 1963 and the 1990s, when its poor water quality led to its being <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> lined with gravel.|$|E

5|$|Henry III of England {{granted a}} market to the Bishop of Ely using letters close on 9April 1224 {{although}} Ely {{had been a}} trading centre prior to this. Present weekly market days are Thursday and Saturday and seasonal markets are held monthly on Sundays and Bank Holiday Mondays from Easter to November. The city is situated on the River Great Ouse, which was a significant means of transport until the fens were <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> Ely ceased to be {{an island in the}} eighteenth century. The river is now a popular boating spot, and has a large marina.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s Benjamin Ferrey was {{replaced}} by Decimus Burton, whose plans for Bournemouth included {{the construction of a}} garden alongside the Bourne stream, an idea first mooted by Granville. The fields south of the road crossing (later Bournemouth Square) were <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> laid out with shrubberies and walks. Many of these paths, including the Invalids' Walk, remain in the town today. A second suggestion of Granville's, a sanatorium, was completed in 1855 and greatly raised Bournemouth's profile as a place for recuperation.|$|E
5|$|The Segaran {{lake area}} {{was the main}} complex of the Taman Sari during its era. This complex {{consisted}} of a man-made lake called Segaran ("artificial sea") with some buildings located on artificial islands {{in the middle of}} a lake. The buildings are connected by an underwater tunnel. It was used as the starting point for the royal family to reach the Taman Sari pools via a vessel. Today, the Segaran lake cannot be seen any longer as the water had been <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> the lake bed is now filled with human settlements. The underwater tunnel, which is now underground after the water had gone, still exist and can be accessed.|$|E

5|$|The main {{drainage}} outlets {{flowing through}} the Moors and Levels are the rivers Axe, Brue, Huntspill, Parrett, Tone, and Yeo, together with the King's Sedgemoor Drain, an artificial channel into which the River Cary now runs. Previously, the Cary ran into the Tone while the Brue ran through Meare Pool (now <b>drained)</b> <b>and</b> the Panborough Gap, {{and then into the}} Axe. Another accomplishment in the Middle Ages was the construction of the tidal Pillrow Cut, joining the Brue and Axe.|$|E
5|$|A mill {{was built}} on Welhay stream but this was {{replaced}} by tidal mills. In the 17th century the City of Bristol bought the manors of North Weston and Portishead {{for access to the}} channel and as a place to stay outside of the city and, in the 19th century, as a seaside resort. An outer sea wall was built allowing the local marshes to be <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> increased the land available for farming. The dominant architecture is early Victorian, with some buildings maintaining their original features. The expansion in residential property coincided with the construction of the dock, pier and the rail link to Bristol. The Royal Hotel by the pier was built in a Tudor Gothic style in 1830, to provide accommodation and catering for travellers on the steamers from Bristol, Wales and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of habitat}} {{is the other}} major threat to the corn crake, since <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> fertilised silage fields are less {{suitable}} for breeding than traditional hay meadows. In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming {{has led to the}} abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area. More localised threats include floods in spring, and disturbance by roads or wind farms, and the loss of many birds – up to 14,000 a year – in Egypt, where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate. Although this may account for 0.5–2.7% of the European population, the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the targeted species were more numerous and predictable.|$|E

5|$|Loss {{of habitat}} {{is the other}} major threat to the corn crake. Apart from the reduced {{suitability}} of <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> fertilised silage fields compared to traditional hay meadows, in western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable has been aided by subsidies, and further east the collapse of collective farming {{has led to the}} abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area. More localised threats include floods in spring, and disturbance by roads or wind farms. This bird is good eating; when they were common in England, Mrs Beeton recommended roasting four on a skewer. More significant than direct hunting is the loss of many birds, up to 14,000 a year, in Egypt, where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate. Although this may account for 0.5–2.7% of the European population, the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the targeted species were more numerous and predictable.|$|E
5|$|Real estate {{companies}} {{continued to}} advertise and sell land along newly dug canals. In April 1912—the {{end of the}} dry season—reporters {{from all over the}} U.S. were given a tour of what had recently been <b>drained,</b> <b>and</b> they returned to their papers and raved about the progress. Land developers sold 20,000lots in a few months. But as news about the Wright report continued to be negative, land values plummeted, and sales decreased. Developers were sued and arrested for mail fraud when people who had spent their life savings to buy land arrived in south Florida expecting to find a dry parcel of land to build upon and instead found it completely underwater. Advertisements promised land that would yield crops in eight weeks, but for many it took at least as long just to clear. Some burned off the sawgrass or other vegetation only to discover that the underlying peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms. Settlers encountered rodents, skinks, and biting insects, and faced dangers from mosquitoes, poisonous snakes and alligators. Though at first crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason. It was discovered later that the peat and muck lacked copper and other trace elements. The USDA released a pamphlet in 1915 that declared land along the New River Canal would be too costly to keep <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> fertilized; people in Ft.Lauderdale responded by collecting all of the pamphlets and burning them.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Creek {{is located}} in the ridge and valley physiographic province. A {{dividing}} ridge separates the creek from the Susquehanna River. One reach of the creek is a mid-sized coldwater stream. Another reach is a large freestone stream. Roaring Creek flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale. Rocks in the watershed include claystones, conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, and shales from the Devonian and Mississippian. Outcroppings of calcareous beds, limestones, and marine fossils occur in the watershed as well. Some mineable coal is present in the watershed of South Branch Roaring Creek. The Genesee beds appear along the creek and are the lowest beds that are visible above the water line. To the east, they are covered by Chemung beds. A soil known as the Albrights Series is found along the creek. It is a reddish-brown soil that is slightly poorly or moderately well <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> is made from glaciated red shale and sandstone.|$|E
25|$|The River Torne, which {{rises to}} the west of Tickhill, crosses the middle of the area. Candy Farm North and South pumping {{stations}} are situated on the area's western edge. The South Engine <b>Drain</b> <b>and</b> Folly <b>Drain</b> form the eastern boundary, and run parallel to the River Torne after it has crossed the Chase. Bull Hassocks pumping station is located {{at the start of the}} South Engine <b>Drain,</b> <b>and</b> is on the site of the first steam powered pumping station. Hatfield Waste <b>Drain</b> <b>and</b> the North Engine Drain run along the northern boundary. Tunnel Pits North and South pumping stations are located on the Hatfield Waste Drain, while Dirtness pumping station is at the head of the North Engine Drain. The buildings here were erected in 1862. All of these watercourses converge on Pilfrey Junction, from where three parallel channels, called Three Rivers, flow to a pumping station at Keadby. The Hatfield Waste Drain crosses under the North Engine Drain before the junction, and then becomes the north channel. The centre channel is formed by the North Engine <b>Drain</b> <b>and</b> the River Torne, while the south channel carries the waters of the South Engine <b>Drain</b> <b>and</b> the Folly <b>Drain.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Land Yeo river {{flows to}} the east of the town. The North Somerset Levels to the west have been <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> farmed by generations of farmers. Tickenham, Nailsea and Kenn Moors SSSI is a 129.4 hectare {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest. The soils in the area include clays of the Allerton and Wentloog Series and peat soils of the Sedgemoor and Godney Series, which are drained by a network of large rhynes and smaller field ditches, which support exceptionally rich plant and invertebrate fauna communities. Exceptional populations of Coleoptera occur, amongst which are at least 12nationally scarce species and 2nationally rare species, including Britain’s largest water beetle the great silver water beetle (Hydrophilus piceus). There are several other local nature reserves.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} war ended in August 1945, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur V. Peterson, the Manhattan District officer with overall {{responsibility}} for the production of fissile material, recommended that the S-50 plant be placed on stand-by. The Manhattan District ordered the plant shut down on 4 September 1945. It was the only production-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant ever built, but its efficiency could not compete with that of a gaseous diffusion plant. The columns were <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> cleaned, and all employees were given two weeks' notice of impending termination of employment. All production had ceased by 9 September, and the last uranium hexafluoride feed was shipped to K-25 for processing. Layoffs began on 18 September. By this time, voluntary resignations had reduced the Fercleve payroll from its wartime peak of 1,600 workers to around 900. Only 241 remained at the end of September. Fercleve's contract was terminated on 31 October, and responsibility for the S-50 plant buildings was transferred to the K-25 office. Fercleve laid off the last employees on 16 February 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian Army was {{stretched}} from Cadzand south to Menen {{on the river}} Leie, and west, from Menin, to Bruges without any sort of reserves. With {{the exception of a}} few RAF sorties, the air was exclusively under the control of the Luftwaffe, and the Belgians reported attacks against all targets considered an objective, with resulting casualties. No natural obstacles remained between the Belgians and the German Army; retreat was not feasible. The Luftwaffe had destroyed most of the rail networks to Dunkirk, just three roads were left: Bruges–Torhout–Dixmude, Bruges–Ghistelles–Nieuport and Bruges–Ostend–Nieuport. Using such axes of retreat was impossible without losses owing to German air supremacy (as opposed to air superiority). Water supplies were damaged and cut off, gas and electricity supplies were also cut. Canals were <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> used as supply dumps for whatever ammunition and food-stuffs were left. The total remaining area covered just 1,700km², and compacted military and civilians alike, of which the latter numbered some 3 million people. Under these circumstances Leopold deemed further resistance useless. On the evening of 27 May, he requested an armistice.|$|E
