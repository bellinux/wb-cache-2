500|$|Starved and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia were {{developed}} for FX {{under the auspices}} of FX president John Landgraf, who sought to expand the network's viewership by providing a wider variety of programming. The shows were the network's first attempts at sitcoms following the short-lived 2003 series Lucky. FX at the time was known primarily for its edgy dramatic series. Bruce Lefkowitz, then executive vice president of Fox Cable Entertainment, outlined the strategy: [...] "We kind of staked out a unique space in dramas that are very different <b>from</b> <b>everybody</b> else’s, so the next natural evolution is to do something in the comedy space." [...] The network ordered seven episodes of each series.|$|E

[...] Although [...] "Burn" [...] is a reference to his dying relationship with Chilli—hence the title—Usher answered the press that the impregnating issue was not taken from a specific situation in his life. He also revealed that his friends who went through similar situations inspired him to write those songs: [...] "...it's just something that I collectively got energy <b>from</b> <b>everybody</b> around me that had been through it." [...] In early 2006, Dupri revealed that {{the story behind the}} album is his: [...] "...me cheating on my steady girlfriend, having a baby with that other woman and having to confess to everything that happened to my main girl." ...|$|E
500|$|The game is {{generally}} known for fixing problems {{found in the}} first game, including improvements such as allowing parties of three characters, having a larger world, better graphics, {{and the ability to}} carry more items. Other noted improvements were keys that can be used multiple times and new strategic elements introduced because of larger parties and larger groups of enemies. The game's music is often praised, despite its limited 8-bit capabilities. Considered a classic for the RPG genre, the game is regarded as praiseworthy. Japanese reviews highlighted the Famicom version's difficulty, stemming from issues such as the many traps in the Cave of Rhone, and the final boss's ability to cast a [...] "Healall" [...] spell, and this has led to some critics calling the game [...] "the most difficult Dragon Quest".

500|$|In June 1972, {{the band}} reconvened in Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next album at the Record Plant. The {{recording}} process was plagued with problems, many {{as a result of}} substance abuse issues. While struggling to record the song [...] "Cornucopia" [...] after [...] "sitting {{in the middle of the}} room, just doing drugs", Ward was nearly fired from the band. [...] "I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just... horrible" [...] Ward said. [...] "I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder <b>from</b> <b>everybody.</b> It was like 'Well, just go home, you're not being of any use right now.' I felt like I'd blown it, I was about to get fired". The album was originally titled Snowblind after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to Black Sabbath Vol. 4, with Ward stating [...] "There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really".|$|E

I thought I was clear... and I tried going down slowly, and Jimmie just must have been there a little bit, turned me sideways and got me on the apron—scared everybody half to death, including me." [...] Stewart, who finished second, said, [...] "I actually had fun racing at Daytona again, which I haven't had for a while. I don't know what the consensus is <b>from</b> <b>everybody</b> else, but I had more fun as a driver tonight than what we've had in the past."

500|$|On August 6, 2005, UPN officially ordered {{thirteen}} {{episodes of}} the series. The network later ordered {{a full season}} of twenty-two episodes of the show on November 7, 2005, amid speculation {{that it would be}} canceled. In 2006, LivingTV broadcast the series in the United Kingdom, and it was broadcast by Nelonen in Sweden in 2008. UPN paired the series with Everybody Hates Chris, Eve, and Cuts to attract an [...] "urban" [...] audience. The network moved WWE SmackDown to Fridays in favor of scheduling Thursdays as focused on sitcoms. This decision was made to establish a [...] "night of scripted programming" [...] and to attract more advertising from film studios to promote upcoming releases. Today questioned the network's belief that Love, Inc. and Everybody Hates Chris would appeal to the same viewership, and noted the difference in quality between the two, with Love, Inc. cited as the inferior show. While the series retained 59% of the audience <b>from</b> <b>Everybody</b> Hates Chris initially, this marketing strategy proved unsuccessful when it lost a majority of the viewership in later episodes.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to his strong regular season numbers, Rivera excelled in the postseason, recording a 8–1 win–loss record and a 0.76 WHIP. He holds numerous postseason records, including: lowest career ERA (minimum 30innings pitched) (0.70); most saves (42); most consecutive scoreless innings pitched (...) most consecutive save opportunities converted (23); and most games pitched (96). No pitcher saved half as many postseason games as Rivera did. Joe Torre, who managed him {{for most of his}} career, said, [...] "Let's face it. The regular season for Mo is great, but that's the cupcakes and the ice cream. What separates him <b>from</b> <b>everybody</b> else is what he's done in the postseason." [...] Rivera's dominance in the postseason often led to him being utilized for two-inning appearances, as he saved a record 14postseason games in this manner. Between 1998 and 2008, he recorded 26postseason saves of four or more outs; the second-highest total by any other pitcher during that time was four such saves, and the rest of baseball combined had 33. At the start of the 2011 playoffs, Rivera ranked first all time in win probability added in the postseason with 11.62, {{more than three times the}} total of the next-closest player. In a 2009 ESPN.com poll, Rivera was voted one of the top five postseason players in MLB history.|$|E
500|$|The {{metaphor of}} the MCU as [...] "the world's biggest TV show" [...] was {{discussed}} again, {{after the release of}} Captain America: Civil War, by Todd VanDerWerff of Vox, who felt that film in particular highlighted Marvel's success with the model, saying, [...] "Viewed in complete isolation, the plot of Captain America: Civil War makes little to no sense ... when you think about where [...] has been in earlier Marvel films ... his leeriness about being subject to oversight makes a lot more sense." [...] VanDerWerff continued that when thinking about the MCU as a television series, many [...] "common criticisms people tend to level at it take on a new context" [...] such as complaints that the films are formulaic, lack [...] "visual spark", or [...] "shoehorn in story elements" [...] that [...] "are necessary to set up future films", all characteristics that [...] "are fairly typical on television, where a director's influence is much lower than that of the showrunner", in this case, Feige. Comparing the films to the series Game of Thrones specifically, VanDerWerff noted that each solo film checks [...] "in on various characters and their individual side stories, before bringing everyone together in the finale (or, rather, an Avengers film)", with Guardians of the Galaxy being equivalent to the character Daenerys Targaryen—"both separated by long distances <b>from</b> <b>everybody</b> else." [...] He noted that this format was an extension of early [...] "TV-like" [...] film franchises such as Star Wars, as well as the format of the comics upon which the films are based. [...] "I say all of this not to suggest that film franchises resembling TV series is necessarily a good trend", VanDerWerff concluded, [...] "For as much as I generally enjoy the Marvel movies, I'm disheartened by the possibility that their particular form might take over the film industry ... But I also don't think it's {{the end of the world}} if Marvel continues on ... there's a reason TV has stolen so much of the cultural conversation over the past few decades. There's something legitimately exciting about the way the medium tells stories when it's good, and if nothing else, Marvel's success shows the film world could learn from that." ...|$|E
