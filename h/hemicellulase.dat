30|$|Several {{transcription}} {{factors have}} been reported as regulators of cellulase and <b>hemicellulase</b> gene expression in other filamentous fungi, e.g., XlnR/Xyr 1 for genes encoding cellulase, <b>hemicellulase,</b> and accessory enzymes involved in xylan degradation in Aspergillus niger and T. reesei (Stricker et al. 2006; van Peij et al. 1998); Ace 2 for cellulase genes in T. reesei (Aro et al. 2001); BglR for the β-glucosidase gene in T. reesei (Nitta et al. 2012); and AraR for the L-arabinose reductase gene in A. niger and Aspergillus nidulans (Battaglia et al. 2011). These transcription factors specifically regulate the expression of cellulase and <b>hemicellulase</b> genes. On the other hand, some transcription factors regulate {{a wide range of}} genes including cellulase and <b>hemicellulase</b> genes. These factors include CreA (Dowzer and Kelly 1989; Ilmen et al. 1996;: Nakari-Setälä et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2013), which is involved in catabolite repression; AreA (Lockington et al. 2002), which is involved in nitrogen source assimilation; and the Hap complex (Tsukagoshi et al. 2001), which regulates various genes. Although a number of transcription factors involved in regulating cellulase and <b>hemicellulase</b> gene expression in other filamentous fungi have been analyzed, the regulation of these gene expressions in A. cellulolyticus has not been investigated. Because A. cellulolyticus is an industrially important fungal species, how cellulase and <b>hemicellulase</b> gene expression is regulated in this organism is crucial for the development of more efficient enzyme production methods.|$|E

30|$|In other {{filamentous}} fungi, CreA protein regulates {{gene expression}} by binding to the promoter region (Ilmen et al. 1996).

Furthermore, the binding sequences {{were found in the}} upstream region of other genes analyzed in Figure  6 (data not shown). These data imply that the CreA protein of A. cellulolyticus represses gene expression by binding to the promoter regions. In T. reesei, transcription of Xyr 1, which is currently considered a main inducer of cellulase and xylanase production, and of Ace 1, which is a specific repressor for cellulase and <b>hemicellulase</b> production, were repressed by carbon catabolite repression involving CreA protein (Mach-Aigner et al. 2008; Portnoy et al. 2011). These data suggest that CreA protein of T. reesei regulates not only cellulase and <b>hemicellulase</b> genes but also their transcription factors. CreA protein of A. cellulolyticus may regulate other transcription factors involving cellulase and <b>hemicellulase</b> production as T. reesei; however, no transcription factors other than CreA of A. cellulolyticus have been investigated.

Second generation biofuels and chemicals are derived from lignocellulosic biomass and other plant waste materials, the production of which does not compete with food production. Polymers of the cell wall need to be degraded into simple sugars by the coordinated action of several different enzymes.

The filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is widely utilised in the industry especially for the production of cellulose- and hemicellulose-degrading enzymes. This thesis focuses on studying the expression of genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZy) and especially the cellulases and hemicellulases of T. reesei. The effects of ambient pH and of different biomass substrates on the gene expression were studied by a microarray method. New knowledge was gained on the different expression patterns of CAZy genes in the presence of various inducing substrates. Ambient pH was shown to be an important determinant of gene expression and to affect the expression of several cellulase and <b>hemicellulase</b> genes.

The T. reesei transformants with either deletion or truncation of cre 1 had clearly altered colony morphology compared with the parental strains, forming smaller colonies and fewer aerial hyphae and spores.

Laboratory-scale bag silos were randomly opened after 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 days of ensiling and subjected to analyses of fermentation quality, carbohydrates loss, microbial amylase and <b>hemicellulase</b> activities, succession of dominant amylolytic or hemicellulolytic microbes, and their microbial and enzymatic properties. Results Both ATMR and LTMR silages were well preserved, with low pH and high lactic acid concentrations. In addition to the substantial loss of water soluble carbohydrates, loss of starch and hemicellulose was also observed in both TMR silages with prolonged ensiling. The microbial amylase activity remained detectable throughout the ensiling in both TMR silages, whereas the microbial <b>hemicellulase</b> activity progressively decreased until it was inactive at day 14 post-ensiling in both TMR silages. During the early stage of fermentation, the main amylase-producing microbes were Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (B. amyloliquefaciens), B. cereus, B. licheniformis, and B. subtilis in ATMR silage and B. flexus, B. licheniformis, and Paenibacillus xylanexedens (P. xylanexedens) in LTMR silage, whereas Enterococcus faecium was closely associated with starch hydrolysis at the later stage of fermentation in both TMR silages.
