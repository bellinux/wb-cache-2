25|$|On March 20, 2003 at {{approximately}} 02:30 UTC or about 90minutes after the lapse of the 48-hour deadline, at 05:33 local time, explosions were heard in Baghdad, signing {{the beginning of}} the U.S. led invasion. Beginning on 21 March 2003, U.S. forces launched Tomahawk missiles <b>at</b> selected <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> positions throughout the Sargat Valley. In preparation for the ground assault, nicknamed Operation Viking Hammer, American Lt. Col. Tovo divided his forces into six mixed peshmerga-Special Forces units. The peshmerga in two of these teams refused to contribute to the assault for various reasons including having lost too many personnel in previous fighting. The peshmerga who did fight were once again armed with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades, and other assorted weapons.|$|R
50|$|Human Rights Watch {{has accused}} <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> of {{committing}} atrocities against {{the civilian population}} in the territory which they controlled. It has been alleged that <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> harshly persecuted the Kaka'i religious minority, and enforced strict Islamic law. Human Rights Watch also accused <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> fighters of torturing prisoners and summarily executing captured PUK soldiers.|$|R
25|$|In addition, the Kurdish Islamist {{militant group}} <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> {{controlled}} a small section of northern Iraq {{in an area}} outside of Saddam Hussein's control. <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> had been fighting against secular Kurdish forces since 2001. At {{the time of the}} invasion they fielded about 600 to 800 fighters. <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> was led by the Jordanian-born militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who would later become an important leader in the Iraqi insurgency. <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> was driven out of Iraq in late March by a joint American-Kurdish force during Operation Viking Hammer.|$|R
50|$|The Kurdistan Islamist {{conflict}} {{was a military}} conflict in Iraqi Kurdistan between the Islamist militant group <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> and the two main Kurdish parties; the Kurdish Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The conflict began in 2001, but subsequently merged with the larger 2003 invasion of Iraq, {{which led to the}} defeat of <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam.</b> After the invasion, <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> continued a low level terrorist insurgency against the Kurdish Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.|$|R
50|$|During the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, US forces aided the PUK {{in attacking}} <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam.</b> In late March 2003, PUK forces {{supported}} by American special forces captured Halabja {{after several days}} of heavy fighting. The surviving <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> forces fled to Iran.|$|R
50|$|In 2003 Talabany {{played a}} leading role in the decisive Operation Viking Hammer to oust the <b>Ansar</b> <b>Al-Islam</b> {{terrorist}} organization, which was recognized as a major threat to Kurdistan’s national security. The operation’s success led to the permanent expulsion of <b>Ansar</b> <b>Al-Islam</b> from the Kurdistan Region.|$|R
50|$|An {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt was}} made {{on the life of}} Barham Salih in April 2002 by <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam.</b> <b>At</b> the time, Saleh was the PUK Regional Government Prime Minister. Later in February 2003 <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> assassinated the prominent PUK commander Shawkat Haji Mushir, along with five other people.|$|R
50|$|In December 2007, {{the leader}} of the Ansar al-Sunnah, Abu Abdullah al-Shafi, issued a communique {{acknowledging}} that the group was simply another name for <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam.</b> The communique went on to state that from that point on, they would return to operating under the name of <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 29 August 2014, a {{statement}} on the behalf of 50 leaders of <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> announced that the group was merging with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, thereby officially dissolving the organization. However, some small elements within <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> rejected this merger, and continued to function as an independent organization.|$|R

50|$|According {{to press}} and {{opposition}} reporting, the <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> attacked Patriotic Union of Kurdistan fighters near Halabjah, killing dozens of persons. Intermittent fighting between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, and the <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> and other Islamic groups continued until late November, when {{an agreement between}} those involved and the Iranian Government imposed a cease-fire.|$|R

5000|$|Conclusion 6: Prewar {{interactions}} between Saddam Hussein's government and al-Qaeda affiliate group <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> were attempts by Saddam {{to spy on}} the group rather than to support or work with them. [...] "Postwar information reveals that Baghdad viewed <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> {{as a threat to}} the regime and that the IIS attempted to collect intelligence on the group." ...|$|R
50|$|After their {{defeat in}} Iraqi Kurdistan, <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> joined the Iraqi {{insurgency}} in Iraq. Several {{terrorist attacks in}} the Irbil area {{have been linked to}} <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> including the suicide bombing of the PUK and KDP headquarters in Irbil that killed 117 people. They also carried out the bombing of the Mount Lebanon Hotel in Baghdad on March 17, 2004.|$|R
50|$|Most importantly, {{their efforts}} {{organized}} the Kurdish Peshmerga {{to become the}} northern front of the invasion. Together this force defeated <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> in Iraqi Kurdistan before the invasion and then defeated the Iraqi army in the north. The battle against <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> led {{to the death of}} a substantial number of militants and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat.|$|R
50|$|The {{emergence}} of strict, militant Islamic {{groups such as}} the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan in northern Iraq had by then already been an additional source of fighting and political tension for some time. The international prominence of al-Qaeda following the 11 September 2001 attacks on the U.S. led to the Qaeda-brokered creation of <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> which further exacerbated sectarian violence. Although sporadic fighting continued with the PKK, the PUK Peshmerga faced its largest threat from <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> which was also supported by the Ba'athist government. Led by Mullah Krekar, a Kurd of strict Islamic faith, <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> was composed of over 500 guerrilla fighters, many of whom fled Afghanistan after the U.S. Operation Enduring Freedom.Although they had faced traditional military opposition from the Iraqis and mountain-based guerrilla tactics during inter-Kurdish fighting, the PUK Peshmerga had difficulty countering the fanatical assault of <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam.</b> The foreign fighters used suicide attacks, assassinations, mines, bombs, and swords and machetes to not only kill the Peshmerga but to desecrate their bodies. Whereas <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> allegedly received support from Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq, the PUK Peshmerga had only the KDP forces as allies. Both parties were steadfast in their displeasure about the <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> presence. PUK commander Anwar Dolani, for example, asserted there is “no room for terrorism in Iraqi Kurdistan” and Massoud Barzani claimed Peshmerga forces did not need assistance to defeat the unwelcome militants. Despite Kurdish solidarity, U.S. preparations to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein brought welcome reinforcements to the conflict.|$|R
50|$|In March 2004 the US State Department officially {{classified}} <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> as {{a terrorist}} organization.|$|R
50|$|The next day, the Americans and Kurds {{pursued the}} <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> forces {{further into the}} mountains, towards the Iranian border. Many fighters {{attempted}} to flee across the border, only to be arrested by the Iranians. Many were sent back across the border and were later captured by Kurdish forces. However, Kurdish sources allege that many <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> fighters were in fact harbored by Iran.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> has {{established}} a presence in Syria {{to take part in}} the Syrian Civil War, initially under the name of [...] "Ansar al-Sham", later under its own name. The group has played a role in the Battle of Aleppo and coordinates with other rebels including the al-Nusra Front and the Islamic Front. The Syrian <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> units in Aleppo remained independent when the main faction joined ISIL in 2014.|$|R

5000|$|The Senate Report on Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq, {{issued in}} 2004, {{concluded}} that Saddam [...] "was aware of <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> and al-Qaeda presence in northeastern Iraq, but the groups' presence {{was considered a}} threat to the regime and the Iraqi government attempted intelligence collection operations against them. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) stated that information from senior <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam</b> detainees revealed that the group viewed Saddam's regime as apostate, and denied any relationship with it." ...|$|R
50|$|Abu Hashim Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman al-Ibrahim was {{the third}} leader of <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> an Islamic militant group {{operating}} in Iraq.|$|R

Krekar became {{the leader of the}} merged <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam,</b> which opposed an agreement made between IMK and the dominant Kurdish group in the area, Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The group later made an allegiance to al-Qaeda and allegedly received direct funds from the terror network.|$|R
5000|$|Rawti Shax or Didi Nwe (ڕەوتی شاخ) ("new course" [...] or [...] "towards the mountain") is a Kurdish dark web-based {{offshoot}} of the Kurdish jihadist group <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam.</b> In October 2015, seventeen members, including the suspected leader, Norway-based Najmuddin Faraj Ahmad [...] "Mullah Krekar" [...] (the original leader of <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Islam),</b> were arrested or indicted in a coordinated, Italy-led multi-nation sweep by police across Europe.
