At a fused portion, {{the first and second}} optical fibers are cut to expose respective cores. The cut or <b>fused</b> <b>end</b> of the first and second optical fibers is arranged to oppose a diaphragm or surface against which a physical phenomenon such as pressure or stress, is applied. In a first embodiment, a source light which is generally single-mode monochromatic, coherent light, is input to the first optical fiber and by evanescence, effectively crosses to the second optical fiber at the fused portion. Source light from the second optical fiber is reflected by the diaphragm or surface, and received at the second optical fiber to generate an output light which has an intensity which depends upon interference of reference light based on the source light, and the reflected light reflected from the diaphragm or surface. The intensity of the output light represents a positional relationship or displacement between the interferometer and the diaphragm or surface...|$|E

40|$|The genome of murine cytomegalovirus, {{extracted}} from extracellular virions, is a linear double-stranded DNA molecule ca. 240 kilobase pairs long. In our initial cloning of subgenomic {{fragments of the}} murine cytomegalovirus genome, we obtained a HindIII clone which contained fused HindIII-terminal fragments. By hybridizing this cloned DNA fragment to infected-cell DNA, we identified an intracellular restriction fragment which was {{the length of the}} sum of the two authentic termini. This fusion fragment was not present in virion DNA but could be detected as early as 2 h postinfection and reached its highest level shortly after the onset of DNA replication at 16 h postinfection. The prereplicative increase of <b>fused</b> <b>ends</b> was not inhibited by a level of phosphonoacetic acid which effectively shut off viral DNA synthesis, nor was the early conversion from free to <b>fused</b> <b>ends</b> prevented by inhibitors of protein or RNA synthesis. The results are consistent with the fused state of viral DNA being a replicative intermediate and precursor to DNA synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral nerve {{interactions}} and regenerative phenomena were studied in newt forelimbs <b>fused</b> <b>end</b> to end. After simple fusion, {{one or two}} spikelike structures regenerated at the plane of fusion in 88 % of the cases. When one of the limbs was denervated {{at the time of}} fusion, no regeneration occurred from the plane of fusion. If the limbs were fused and one was amputated at the shoulder more than 10 days after fusion, regeneration from the amputation surface did not occur. When the limbs were reamputated 30 days later, regeneration of left limbs from the proximodistally reversed right limb stumps followed. If one of the limbs was denervated at the time of fusion, and amputation was subsequently carried out through the formerly denervated limb, regeneration always took place after the first amputation. On the basis of these results it is postulated that when regenerating nerves of opposite proximodistal polarity meet head-on, the majority of fibers, at least, do not grow into territories occupied by the other nerve. These results have also demonstrated that full limb regeneration can occur at a greater distance from the midline than the end of a normal limb. These experiments also provide a technique for artificially elongating peripheral nerves...|$|E

40|$|The cell {{movements}} and contacts in somite formation in Xenopus are unusual. The vertebrate somite {{as seen in}} section is traditionally described as a rosette and is formed by pinching off a group of cells from the paraxial meso-derm; these cells then increase intercellular contacts. Typical rosettes with cells radiating from the myocoel {{may be seen in}} the Axolotl (Fig. 1 A). Not all the cells of a rosette have the same fate. The lateral ones become dermis and spread out under the epidermis forming a continuous sheet with their counterparts from neighbouring somites. The majority of the somitic cells, which are myo-tomal, will elongate antero-posteriorly and <b>fuse</b> <b>end</b> to end with other cells of the same somite (Przybylski & Blumberg, 1966; Riabova, 1966). In this way myo-tubes are formed which stretch {{from one end of the}} somite to the other and obliterate the myocoel. Somites are formed in an orderly anterior-posterior succession.

40|$|Introduction and Objectives Missed canal {{systems are}} the most {{frequent}} cause for endodontic treatment failure. The latter surely applies for mandibular molar teeth. In order to minimize the needs for retreatment, all potential diagnostic means should be applied {{in order to maximize}} visualisation and localisation of the root canal anatomy. The objective of the present study is to evaluate mandibular molar canal anatomy, with a specific focus on identification of a mesial root isthmus using microCT. Once this problem is fully understood, diagnostic CBCT imaging may be focused on identifying such structures. Method In this study 29 lower molar teeth were scanned using the SkyScan 1173 high-energy micro-CT system. The scan was made with an isotropic pixel resolution of 12. 5 micron. For each sample, a stack of images was reconstructed providing axial cross sections of the internal structure of the samples. For every sample, a classification was made for the type of connection according to Hsu and Kim (1997). Results 3 D surface rendered models show the complexity of the root canal system. The canals can end up separately (n= 12) or be <b>fused</b> <b>ending</b> in one single foramen (n= 17). From the 29 samples, the following classification was made: 1 tooth type I, 2 teeth type II, 4 type III, 6 type IV and 16 teeth type V. Conclusion The study showed an important complexity and variability of canal morphology amongst mandibular molar teeth. With regard to the isthmus in the mesial root, isthmus type V was found in most of samples, suggestion full connection between 2 canals. The present findings on mandibular root canal morphology may further serve as gold standard to evaluate diagnostic image quality of CBCT images with a focus on canal and isthmus morphologic detection. status: publishe...|$|R
