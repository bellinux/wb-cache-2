Title of map on Plate I: Geologic mapBibliography: pages 152 - 161 The study area lies in the Yuha desert near the western margin of the Salton Trough structural province and is centered on the northern extension of the Laguna Salada fault zone. The focus of this study is an analysis of the interrelationship between different phases of late Cenozoic structural development and their relationship with the Elsinore and southern Laguna Salada faults which trend towards the study area from the northwest and southeast, respectively. The northern Laguna Salada fault is not comprised of a single break in this area. Rather, the geometry of dextral faulting is complicated and represented by both left-stepping and right-stepping strands, not all of which have been active synchronously. Within {{the southern part of the}} field area, the Laguna Salada fault apparently steps left across Lucy Ridge producing a broad area of elevated topography. Just north of the border, the present activity steps right to the Sunrise Butte strand and then steps left again at Yuha Basin to become the Elsinore fault. Older strands are also present and indicate that the complexity of stepping patterns has changed with time. Field mapping identified an area dominated by a northeast structural grain which is rotated clockwise near the Laguna Salada fault. Excellent exposures of detachment-related, normal faults in progressive stages of development were found. A pervasive tectonic fabric of the rocks also attest to the regional extension. Structural analyses indicate the strata has undergone two deformational events resulting in superposed folds. The first-order folding is about a northeast trending axis whereas the second-order folding is about a west-northwest trending axis. Field data, kinematic indicators and the structural analyses support the following interpretation of the deformational events. The first event is related to extension in a northeast-southwest direction. This extension produced northeast trending folds, detachment-related faults, tilted homoclinal fault blocks and a pervasive low-angle tectonic fabric. The second, less pronounced, event was due primarily to wrench-related stresses associated with the present Laguna Salada fault zone. The wrench deformation produced west-northwest trending folds, associated faulting and horizontal rotation of blocks. The magnitude of this rotation is directly proportional to the proximity of the wrench fault. The deformation associated with both events involve the basement rock, the Pliocene Imperial Formation and the Pleistocene Palm Spring Formation indicating the youngest documented evidence of detachment faulting in the Salton Trough region. The Salton Trough and other subsidiary basins, such as the Laguna Salada basin, are postulated to be the source of the regional extension experienced in this area. This idea is also suggested by gravity trends. Therefore, the study area is important as it provides an excellent opportunity to study the complex stress interactions, in particular extensional deformation, generated in oblique pull-apart systems...|$|E

The Alverson Formation is exposed in several locations along the western margin of the Salton Trough from the Mexican-U. S. border north to the Fish Creek Mountains. These early-mid Miocene volcanic rocks and associated alluvial sediments may record the initial rifting and extension of the northern proto-Gulf of California. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the nature and relationship between the scattered volcanic sequences in order to better understand their origin. Samples were collected from Painted Gorge, Fossil Canyon, and Butaca Canyon in the southeastern Coyote Mountains, from northern Red Rock Canyon in the Fish Creek Mountains, and from Superstition Mountain. The samples were analyzed using x-ray fluorescence to determine major and trace element characteristics. Na 2 O was analyzed by atomic absorption techniques. Detailed petrographic study of the samples was also performed. The petrographic and geochemical study of these volcanic flows allows delineation of separate alkalic and tholeiitic sequences. Alkali olivine basalt flows occur in Superstition Mountain and in Fossil and Butaca Canyons. These flows are older than 16 m. y. and are chemically distinct in that they have high K 2 O/Na 2 O ratios (> 1) and extremely high concentrations of K, Ba, Sr, and Rb. They are generally low-alumina basalts and have higher TiO 2 concentration than the tholeiites. Olivine tholeiites occur in Painted Gorge and northern Red Rock Canyon. They are generally younger than 16 m. y. Chemically, the tholeiites have much lower TiO 2, K 2 O, Ba, and Rb and generally higher K/Rb ratios than the alkali basalts. The tholeiites are generally high-alumina. The volcanic sequences of the Alverson Formation within the Salton Trough reflect the initiation of basaltic volcanism that accompanied the extensional tectonics related to the conversion from oblique subduction to transform motion along the western margin of the North American plate during Miocene time in Southern California. The differing chemistry and petrology of the alkali and tholeiite volcanic series from the Alverson Formation suggest separate depths of basalt genesis for the two sequences. The nepheline-normative alkali olivine basalts probably resulted from partial melting and magma segregation at mantle depths between 35 - 70 km. The tholeiitic basalts may have resulted from partial melting and magma segregation in the upper mantle at depths of about 30 km, giving rise to high-alumina basalts. The compositional change of the magmas from alkali olivine to high-alumina olivine tholeiite suggests a decreasing depth to the zone of magma generation with time. This records an increasing geothermal gradient related to the onset of continental rifting within the Salton Trough region of the proto-Gulf of California beginning 21 m. y. ago. The extremely high concentration of K, Rb, Sr, Ba, and SiO 2 was partially caused by the contamination of these basalts that occurred as the flows rose through rifting continental crust...|$|E
