5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cleaning}} teeth {{is to remove}} plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) {{in order to prevent}} formation of plaque and tartar. A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> removes plaque from between teeth and at the gum line, where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.|$|E
5|$|Food {{impaction}} {{occurs when}} food debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or <b>dental</b> <b>floss</b> in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E

40|$|AIM: Regular <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> {{has been}} widely {{recommended}} to prevent periodontal diseases. Nevertheless, compliance is below a desirable level. This study evaluates {{the effects of a}} brief behavioural intervention on <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> and determines whether the effects of such an intervention are stronger in a specific subgroup of individuals (those intending to floss regularly=implemental mindset). MATERIALS AND METHOD: Behavioural intervention (planning when, where and how to floss) trial was conducting with 194 participants assigned to an intervention or a control group by a random time schedule; the primary outcome was validated self-report of flossing behaviour. Follow-up data were collected 2 and 8 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: Individuals receiving the planning intervention significantly outperformed those in the control condition at both the 2 - and the 8 -week follow-up (4. 24 times flossing/week versus 3. 9 at 2 weeks; 4. 02 versus 2. 98 at 8 weeks). Intervention effects were stronger in individuals in the implemental mindset. Dropout rates were higher for participants who received the planning intervention but were not in the implemental mindset. CONCLUSION: Planning interventions are an economic and effective way to change oral self-care behaviour, and are more effective in individuals in an implemental mindset...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Adoption and {{maintenance}} of health behaviors are often poorly predicted by behavioral intentions. To {{bridge the gap between}} intentions and behavior, strategic planning and recovery self-efficacy have been suggested as proximal predictors. PURPOSE The aim was to examine the usefulness of a prediction model that includes planning and self-efficacy as postintentional mediator variables. METHODS Four longitudinal studies were conducted on <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> (Study I, N = 157), seat belt use (Study II, N = 298), dietary behaviors (Study III, N = 700), and physical activity (Study IV, N = 365). <b>Dental</b> <b>flossing</b> and seat belt use were assessed in students by paper-and-pencil questionnaires, whereas dietary behavior and physical activity inventories were presented to the general public in the internet. RESULTS By structural equation modeling, it was found that one common model fits all four data sets well. Results differed in terms of variance accounted for, but the overall patterns of estimated parameters were similar across samples. CONCLUSIONS Self-efficacy and planning seemed to be functional as proximal predictors of health behaviors, whereas health risk perception appeared to be a negligible factor. When predicting health behaviors, self-regulatory variables should be used in addition to the behavioral intention...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Previous {{studies have}} shown that gain-framed {{messages}} (vs. loss-framed messages) are more effective when advocating 'low-risk' prevention behaviours (e. g., diet, exercise, <b>dental</b> <b>flossing)</b> that minimize the risk of a health problem. The objective of the reported research was to explore whether autonomy moderated the effectiveness of gain-framed vs. loss-framed messages encouraging fruit and vegetable consumption. DESIGN: A prospective design was used for this study. METHOD: At time 1, participants (N =  177) completed a measure of autonomy and read either a gain-framed message (describing the benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption) or a loss-framed message (describing the disadvantages of not eating fruit and vegetables). At time 2, participants reported their fruit and vegetable consumption over the preceding 7  days. RESULTS: Autonomy moderated the effect of message framing. Gain-framed messages only prompted fruit and vegetable consumption amongst those with high levels of autonomy. CONCLUSION: The study identifies a key role for autonomy in shaping recipients' responses to framed messages promoting fruit and vegetable consumption. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? Previous {{studies have shown}} that gain-framed messages (vs. loss framed messages) are more effective when advocating low-risk prevention behaviours (e. g., diet, exercise, <b>dental</b> <b>flossing)</b> that minimize the risk of a health problem. What does this study add?

40|$|A {{sequential}} {{intervention to}} facilitate the adoption and maintenance of <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> was conducted among 205 students in India, aged 18 – 26 years. Two experimental groups received different treatment sequences and were observed at three assessment points, 34 days apart. One group received first a motivational intervention (intention, outcome expectancies, and risk perception, followed by a self-regulatory intervention (planning, self-efficacy, and action control). The second group received the same intervention in the opposite order. Both intervention sequences yielded gains in terms of flossing, planning, self-efficacy, and action control. However, at Time 2, those who had received the self-regulatory intervention first, were superior to their counterparts who had received the motivational intervention first. At Time 3, differences vanished as everyone had then received both interventions. Thus, findings highlight {{the benefits of a}} self-regulatory compared to a mere motivational intervention...|$|R

40|$|This {{commentary}} is {{a response}} to O’Keefe and Jensen’s (2007 /this issue) metaanalysis of the persuasive effects of gain- and loss-framed messages encouraging disease prevention behaviors. We suggest that the future of message framing is promising with newly emerging approaches to increasing message effectiveness. For almost two decades, researchers have been examining the effectiveness of gainand loss-framed appeals for persuading individuals to make healthy lifestyle choices. Guided by the framing postulates of prospect theory (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981), Rothman and Salovey (1997) proposed that loss-framed messages emphasizing costs persuade people to engage in behaviors that are construed as risky given their potential to indicate the presence of disease (e. g., detection behaviors such as mammography screening). Conversely, they hypothesized that gain-framed messages emphasizing benefits convince people to engage in behaviors that are characterized by little risk or uncertainty (e. g., prevention behaviors such as <b>dental</b> <b>flossing).</b> The meta-analysis by O’Keefe and Jensen (1997 =this issue) provides a thorough and critical evaluation of this latter hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} 1979 Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination {{recommendations}} on {{the diagnosis and}} prevention of periodontal disease. OPTIONS: Self-care at home, professional care, treatment with antimicrobial agents and management of patients at high risk. OUTCOMES: Maintaining the gingiva, alveolar bone and periodontal ligament in a healthy state (absence of gingival bleeding and no loss of epithelial attachment). EVIDENCE: A literature search for articles published from 1980 to 1993 was conducted. Selected studies published before 1980 were also reviewed {{if there were no}} recent updates. Evidence was evaluated and classified as good, fair or poor according to the criteria of the task force. VALUES: The task force's evidence-based rules for recommendations were used. In addition, whenever feasible, and on the basis of advice from the reviewers and experts, recommendations were modified in the interest of maintaining oral health (e. g., <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> in children). BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: The recommendations are not expected to increase the costs of preventing periodontal diseases for the general population.

40|$|Objective: Habit {{might be}} usefully {{characterized}} {{as a form of}} automaticity that involves the association of a cue and a response. Three studies examined habitual automaticity in regard to different aspects of the cue-response relationship characteristic of unhealthy and healthy habits. Design, Main Outcome Measures, and Results: In each study, habitual automaticity was assessed by the Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI). In Study 1 SRHI scores correlated with attentional bias to smoking cues in a Stroop task. Study 2 examined the ability of a habit cue to elicit an unwanted habit response. In a prospective field study, habitual automaticity in relation to smoking when drinking alcohol in a licensed public house (pub) predicted the likelihood of cigarette-related action slips 2 months later after smoking in pubs had become illegal. In Study 3 experimental group participants formed an implementation intention to floss in response to a specified situational cue. Habitual automaticity of <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> was rapidly enhanced compared to controls. Conclusion: The studies provided three different demonstrations of the importance of cues in the automatic operation of habits. Habitual automaticity assessed by the SRHI captured aspects of a habit that go beyond mere frequency or consistency of the behavior. © 2010 American Psychological Association...|$|R
40|$|Health-compromising {{behaviors}} such as physical inactivity and poor dietary habits are difficult to change. Most social-cognitive theories assume that an individual 2 ̆ 7 s intention to change is the best direct predictor of actual change. But people often do not behave {{in accordance with their}} intentions. This discrepancy between intention and behavior is due to several reasons. For example, unforeseen barriers could emerge, or people might give in to temptations. Therefore, intention needs to be supplemented by other, more proximal factors that might compromise or facilitate the translation of intentions into action. Some of these postintentional factors have been identified, such as perceived self-efficacy and strategic planning. They help to bridge the intention–behavior gap. The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) suggests a distinction between (a) preintentional motivation processes that lead to a behavioral intention, and (b) postintentional volition processes that lead to the actual health behavior. In this article, seven studies are reported that examine the role of volitional mediators in the initiation and adherence to five health behaviors: physical exercise, breast self-examination, seat belt use, dietary behaviors, and <b>dental</b> <b>flossing.</b> The general aim is to examine the applicability of the HAPA and its universality by replicating it across different health behaviors, based on various measures, time spans, and samples from different countries...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the status of}} dental caries {{in a sample of}} Iranian adolescents aged 14 to 18 years in Qazvin, and to identify caries-related factors affecting this group. Study design: Qazvin was divided into three zones according to socio-economic status. The sampling procedure used was a stratified cluster sampling technique; incorporating 3 stratified zones, for each of which a cluster of school children were recruited from randomly selected high schools. The adolescents {{agreed to participate in the}} study and to complete a questionnaire. Dental caries status was assessed in terms of decayed teeth (DT), filled teeth (FT) and decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT). A multivariate regression analysis was used to determine statistically significant associations between DMFT and other variables. Results: The study sample comprised 380 adolescents, 188 (49. 5 %) being male. The mean age of the adolescents was 15. 42 (SD= 1. 1) years, and the mean DMFT was 2. 61 (SD= 1. 89). Boys had significantly higher DMFT scores than girls (P< 0. 05). The multivariate regression analyses revealed a significant relation between high DMFT scores and such variables as increasing age, male gender, lower levels of parental education, higher family income, lower frequency of tooth brushing and <b>dental</b> <b>flossing,</b> having a history of no visits to the dentist, and bad perception of own oral health. Conclusions: The present study reveals that Iranian adolescents have a poor oral hygiene, as very few subjects brush and floss their teeth on a regular basis. Although the incidence of caries was found to be moderate, it was influenced by demographic factors such as age and gender in addition to socio-behavioral variables such as fami-ly income, the level of education attained by parents, the frequency of <b>dental</b> brushing and <b>flossing,</b> and both the frequency and type of visit to a dentist. © Medicina Oral S.

40|$|Objectives: Two studies {{explored}} the relative efficacy of a morality-based versus a competence-based self-affirmation manipulation at increasing acceptance of personally relevant health-risk information. In accordance with prior theorising (e. g., Cohen & Sherman, 2014), {{it was hypothesized}} that the morality affirmation would be more effective than the competence affirmation in such contexts, as the former targets a different domain to that threatened by the health-risk information. Design: Both studies employed a cross-sectional experimental design. Methods: Participants were presented with a morality affirmation, competence affirmation or no affirmation control prior to reading a message about the risks of (a) not engaging in daily <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> (Study 1) and (b) red meat consumption (Study 2). Participants subsequently completed a number of measures assessing acceptance of the message. Results: In line with predictions, findings from both studies demonstrated that the morality affirmation precipitated greater acceptance of personally relevant health-risk information compared to the competence affirmation, as reflected in more positive attitudes (Studies 1 and 2) and intentions (Study 1). Study 2 ’s findings further suggested that the superior efficacy of the morality affirmation in health-related contexts could not simply be attributed to a general tendency for this affirmation to outperform the competence affirmation. Conclusions: The nature of the value affirmed may be a critical factor in determining the success of self-affirmation manipulations in health-related domains...|$|R

Motivational techniques in combination with financial incentives are shown to lead to effective behavior change. The current study sought to examine whether a brief oral health promotion program (self-management cues that were based on self-efficacy and self-regulatory skills) in combination with an incentive (free dental treatment) {{would make a difference}} in the adoption of regular <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> in a population of Indian periodontal disease outpatients. Methods One hundred and twelve participants (n[*]=[*] 55 oral health promotion intervention group; n[*]=[*] 57 control group) were assigned to the intervention (self-management cues[*]+[*]incentive) or control groups, and follow-up assessments were performed three weeks later. Flossing frequency, behavioral intentions, and perceived self-efficacy served as dependent variables. Data were analyzed with mixed models, ANCOVAs, and path analyses. Results The intervention yielded effects on flossing frequency (p[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 01) and flossing intentions (p[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 01) at follow-up. Women developed stronger intentions than men. Moreover, by path analysis a sequential mediation chain was found that demonstrated an indirect effect of the intervention on flossing via self-efficacy and intentions: the intervention predicted changes in self-efficacy which, in turn, were associated with changes in intentions, predicting flossing frequency at follow up, while controlling for baseline behavior, gender, and age.

40|$|Background: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the application of health belief model in oral health education for 12 -year-old children and its effect on oral health behaviors and indexes. Methods: A quasi- experimental study was carried out on twelve-year-old girl students (n- 291) in the first grade of secondary school, in the central district of Tehran, Iran. Research sample was selected by a multistage cluster sampling. The data was obtained by using a valid reliable questionnaire for measuring the perceptions, a checklist for observing the quality of brush-ing and <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> and health files and clinical observation. First, a descriptive study was applied to individual percep-tions, oral behaviors, Oral Hygiene Index (OHI) and Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth Index (DMFTI). Then an educational planning based on the results and Health Belief Model (HBM) was applied. The procedure was repeated after six months. Results: After education, based on HBM, all the oral health perceptions increased (P<. 05). Correct brushing and flossing are influenced by increased perceptions. A low correlation between the reduction of DMFTI and increased perceived sever-ity and increased perceived barriers are found (r =- 0. 28, r = 0. 43 respectively). In addition, there was a limited correlation between OHI and increased perceived benefits (r =- 0. 26).

40|$|Objectives: This study {{investigated}} health inequality for self-reported oral health outcomes among adolescents. The role of oral health behaviors and psychological factors in explaining oral health inequality was investigated using {{the hypothesis of}} mediation. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that used self-completed questionnaires. This study sampled 639 (315 male and 324 female) 15 - to 17 -year-old adolescents (second and third grade high school students) of both sexes {{in the city of}} Sanandaj in the province of Kurdistan, western Iran. Socioeconomic indicators of the study were subjective socioeconomic status, wealth index, and parental education. Oral health behaviors were measured as toothbrushing frequency, <b>dental</b> <b>flossing</b> frequency, and <b>dental</b> visits. Psychological factors were self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. Self-reported oral health outcomes were single item self-rated oral health and the experience of dental pain. Regression analysis was used to test four conditions for the hypothesis of mediation. Results: The results showed that the inequality is present in oral health for some pairs of relationships between socioeconomic status and oral health outcomes. Adjustment for oral health behaviors and psychological factors, individually and simultaneously, led to loss of statistical significance for some pairs of the relationships. However, adjustment for oral health behaviors and psychological factors led to only small changes in the associations between socioeconomic status and self-reported oral health outcomes. Conclusions: This study found a graded oral health inequality, but no strong evidence to support the hypothesis that oral health behaviors and psychological factors mediate oral health inequality for self-reported oral health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Simply {{answering}} questions about a specific behavior may change that behavior. This {{is known as the}} mere-measurement or question–behavior effect (QBE). Our objective was to synthesize the evidence for the QBE on health-related behaviors. Method: Included studies were randomized controlled trials that tested the effect of questionnaires or interviews about health-related behaviors and/or related cognitions compared with a no-measurement control condition or another form of measurement. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential moderators. Results: 41 studies were included assessing a range of health behaviors. Meta-analyses showed a small overall QBE effect (SMD = 0. 09; 95 % CI [0. 04, 0. 13]; k = 33). Studies showed moderate heterogeneity, variable risk of bias, and evidence of publication bias. No dose–response relationships were found from studies comparing more with less intensive measurement conditions. There {{were no significant differences in}} QBE by behavior, but QBEs for <b>dental</b> <b>flossing,</b> physical activity, and screening attendance were significantly different from 0. Findings were not altered by whether behavior or cognitions were measured, attitudes were or were not measured, studies used questionnaires or interviews, or outcomes were objective or self-reported. Conclusions: There is some evidence for the QBE on health-related behavior. However, risk of bias within studies and evidence of publication bias indicate that the observed small effect size may be overestimated, especially given that some studies included intervention techniques in addition to providing questionnaires. Preregistered high-quality trials with clear specification of intervention content are needed to confirm if and when measurement leads to behavior change...|$|R
