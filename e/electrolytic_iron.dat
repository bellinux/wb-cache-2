Three experiments were conducted to assess the absorption of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> powder relative to FeSO 4, as affected by iron dose and by ascorbic or phytic acid. Iron absorption by 56 volunteers was measured from a farina cereal breakfast radiolabeled with 59 FeSO 4 or an electrolytic 55 Fe powder irradiated by neutron activation. Absorption was determined from whole-body counting (59 Fe) and blood isotope incorporation 2 wk later. Absorption of iron from the irradiated electrolytic powder was 5 – 15 % that of FeSO 4. Ascorbic acid (; 160 mg) enhanced iron absorption from FeSO 4 by almost 4 -fold but only doubled absorption from <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> (P for interaction, 0. 01). Phytic acid from wheat bran inhibited iron absorption from FeSO 4 and <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> by 73 and 50 %, respectively (P for interaction, NS).

40|$|Food {{fortification}} is {{an effective}} strategy for reaching populations with micronutrient deficiencies. Fortification with iron presents a major challenge {{because of the presence}} of phytates and other iron absorption inhibitors in diets of poor people. Addition of iron does not necessarily mean that it is absorbed. Because of its low cost and its relative stability in food vehicles, <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> has been the fortificant of choice in many national programmes, despite its low bioavailability compared to fortificants such as ferrous salts. NaFeEDTA may be a more effective iron fortificant in high-phytate foods. Concerns about its cost and safety, however, have delayed its application in fortification programmes.   This thesis is based on a 5 -month randomised placebo-controlled trial conducted among school children (n = 516) aged 3 - 8 years in Kenya in May-November 2005. It aimed to measure the benefits of fortification with NaFeEDTA or <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron,</b> and to assess the safety of using NaFeEDTA as an iron fortificant. The specific objectives were to assess a) the efficacy of fortifying whole maize flour with NaFeEDTA (28 mg iron/kg flour or 56 mg/kg) or <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> (56 mg/kg); b) the effect of the intervention on cognitive and motor function; c) response to the intervention of individuals with α + -thalassaemia genotype relative to their counterparts with a normal genotype; d) and the effect of NaFeEDTA on the status of zinc, calcium, copper, magnesium and manganese.   Fortification with NaFeEDTA at high levels (56 mg iron per kg flour), or low levels (28 mg/kg) reduced the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia by 89 % (95 % CI 49 % to 97 %) and 48 % (- 20 % to 77 %), respectively. High-dose fortification with NaFeEDTA led to larger gains in iron status than low-dose level, and was more efficacious in children with iron deficiency at baseline. By contrast, <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> did not improve iron status. There was no evidence that the iron intervention improved either cognitive or motor function of these children; or that children with the α + -thalassaemia genotype responded differently to the iron intervention than their peers with a normal genotype. There was also no evidence that NaFeEDTA adversely affected the status of the nutritionally important mineral elements assessed.   The thesis concludes that in high-phytate flours, NaFeEDTA is more suitable than <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> for supplementation of iron in the diet. Governments should act and implement national programmes to fortify industrially processed flour, whereby NaFeEDTA should be considered the preferred fortificant in high-phytate food vehicles...|$|E

Fortification of staple foods is an adequate strategy to provide additional iron to populations at risk. In South Africa it is mandatory to fortify maize meal and wheat flour with iron, {{as well as other}} micronutrients. Elemental iron, specifically <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron,</b> is currently the preferred choice but other compounds that might be more effective in alleviating iron deficiency are under consideration. Objectives: The objective {{of this study was to}} provide information about the bioavailability of ferrous fumarate and NaFeEDTA from maize meal porridge in young children, which would assist in selecting a bioavailable alternative to <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> in the South African National Food Fortification Programme, Methods: A randomized parallel study design was used, with each of the 2 groups further randomised to receive either one of two test regimens in a crossover design in which each child acted as his/her own control. Iron bioavailability was measured with a stable-isotope technique based on erythrocyte incorporation 15 days after intake. Results: The mean absorption of iron from NaFeEDTA and ferrous fumarate from the maize porridge meal was 11. 5 % and 9. 29 % respectively. NaFeEDTA and ferrous fumarate are both sufficiently bioavailable from a maize based meal rich in phytates.

The final choice between ferrous fumarate and NaFeEDTA as when it comes to finding the alternative iron fortificant will depend on factors such as technical compatibility, bioavailability, relative cost and organoleptic characteristics.

40|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{iron deficiency}} (ID) {{and the related}} iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects about 50 % of children and woman and about 25 % of men. In total, an estimated two billion people is affected worldwide. In developing countries, a typical diet is based on cereals, legumes and vegetables and these contain many iron inhibitors like phytic acid and polyphenols. Iron fortification of maize meal, a staple food in South Africa {{is regarded as a}} cost effective, sustainable way to improve iron status in that country. The replacement of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> with sodium iron (III) ethylenediaminetetraacetate (NaFeEDTA) (a more bioavailable source of iron) in the current multi-micronutrient fortificant premix added to maize meal as an iron fortificant compound has the potential to greatly enhance the efforts to improve the iron status of populations consuming high-phytate cereal-based diets. However, poor consumer acceptance, unacceptable taste and discolouration of iron fortified foods have been frequently listed as causes of unsuccessful iron fortification programmes. This study evaluated the effects of replacing <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> (35 mg iron/kg maize meal) in a multi-micronutrient fortificant premix with NaFeEDTA (at 15 and 30 mg iron/kg maize meal) added to special maize meal on the colour (L* a* b*) and sensory properties (appearance and flavour) of stiff porridges. The porridges were prepared using three different types of cooking vessels (stainless steel, cast iron and aluminium pots) and was evaluated fresh (within 30 minutes of preparation) and after 24 hour refrigerated storage (3 - 5 oC). The porridges were subjected to analytical sensory evaluation to test for difference or similarity and a consumer acceptance test (n = 80 consumers). <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> significantly reduced L* and a* colour values in fortified maize meal when compared to maize meal fortified with the multi-micronutrient mix excluding iron. Elemental iron powders (e. g. <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron)</b> being black or dark grey powders may have caused slight darkening of cereal flours. The spot iron test showed a uniform distribution of iron in maize meal with NaFeEDTA 15 (fortified with 15 mg iron/kg maize meal), NaFeEDTA 30 (fortified at 30 mg iron/kg maize meal) and <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> as well commercially fortified maize meals. <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> or NaFeEDTA 15 and 30 maize meals resulted in stiff maize porridge prepared in aluminium, cast iron and stainless steel having lower L* values when compared to porridge prepared from maize meal fortified with the multi-micronutrient premix excluding iron. This could be attributed to interaction between polyphenols (ferulic and p-coumaric acid) found in maize meal and iron ions (Fe 2 +/Fe 3 +). This interaction has been suggested to induce structural changes and polymerisation in the polyphenols and thereby influencing their light absorption pattern and thus leading to darkening of maize porridges. Cast iron cookware showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) between iron treated porridges and control porridge (fortified with premix excluding iron) in both appearance and flavour while stainless steel showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) between iron treated porridges and control porridge only in flavour and aluminium cookware showed significant differences (p < 0. 05) between iron treated porridges and control porridge only in appearance. These differences could be attributed to the differences in thermal conductivity and heat transfer of the materials of the different cooking vessels and possible leaching of iron ions (Fe 3 +/Fe 2 +) from cast iron and stainless steel cookware and aluminium (Al 3 +) ions from aluminium cookware at different concentrations and/or rates during the cooking process. Appearance changes are probably due to the interaction between ion irons and polyphenols while flavour changes could be attributed to possible lipid oxidation of linoleic acid, a major polyunsaturated fatty acid found in maize meal. Iron ions (Fe 3 +/Fe 2 +) promotes lipid oxidation of linoleic acid leading to the development of hexanal, a major off-flavour compound in iron fortified maize meal porridge. Findings from this study indicate that a change from fortifying maize meal with <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> to NaFeEDTA will not lead to changes in appearance and flavour of maize porridge. However, an excess amount of NaFeEDTA (30 mg iron/kg maize meal) might lead to acceptability (taste) problems if porridge is prepared in cast iron cookware. Fortification of maize meal porridge with a more bioavailable source of iron (NaFeEDTA) may reduce the prevalence of iron deficiency in South Africa.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of electrolytic hydrogen through membranes of pure iron, and two iron-carbon alloys has been investigated. In the initial experiments diffusion coefficients for <b>electrolytic</b> hydrogen in <b>iron</b> membranes {{have been obtained}} using a refined time-lag technique. Results showed an initial fast diffusion followed by a secondary slower stage. The initial stage yields diffusion coefficients which agree closely with extrapolated high temperature values (2 to 5. 5 x 10 - 5 cm 2 sec- 1); the second stage yields considerably lower coefficients (1 to 3 x 10 - 6 cm 2 sec- 1) which vary with membrane thickness. Results indicate {{the formation of a}} barrier to hydrogen flow as diffusion proceeds. Calculation of the effective barrier thickness enables the correction of apparent coefficients reported in the literature and quantitatively predicts the anomalous thickness effect. Further experiments using a more sophisticated experimental technique yield electrochemical constants for the hydrogen discharge and entry mechanism (transfer coefficients alpha 1 = 3 / 4 and alpha 2 = 1 / 2). Overpotential measurements indicate that the barrier may be identified with the formation of adsorbed hydrogen on the membrane surface. Reaction of oxygen with the adsorbed layer is responsible for occurrence of the secondary diffusion effect. The temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient and permeability has been determined as: D= 4. 91 x 10 - 4 exp (- 1450 /RT) cm 2 sec and D = 1. 3 x 10 - 3 exp (- 5600 /RT) cm 2 sec- 1, respectively.

At OGI, batch experiments were conducted on Fe(0) systems (both Fisher <b>Electrolytic</b> and Nano-sized <b>iron).</b> The experiments were done with and without buffer. The buffered experiments tried to contrast two buffers: an organic buffer (EPPS, presumably a H atom donor), and the inorganic borate. In the buffered experiments, the pH was varied (7. 3 and 8. 4). For the pre-exposure treatment, after trying a variety of methods, like shaking and not shaking for varied amounts of time, {{it was decided to}} stick with not shaking and have a pre-exposure of 24 hours. The unbuffered data did not show any marked trend with increasing mass of Felc. However, 3. 5 g of Fe showed about 100 % conversion to CHCl 3, and 1 g of Fe showed 50 % conversion. At pHs 8. 4 and 7. 3, there was no trend observed for branching ratios between EPPS and Borate buffer. kCT (disappearance rate constant of carbon tetrachloride) values were found to be different from CT and CF fits. Experiments with nano-iron (unbuffered, buffered with both buffers at pH 8. 3), did not show any trend with respect to Fisher Iron, except for the unbuffered experiments, where the CF ''yield'' was less in the nano iron case. Future experiments involve testing for chloride, formate and CO, and performing experiments over a wider range of pH and buffers. Batch experiments were conducted at PNNL to compare the efficiency and product distribution of representative Fe(II) and Fe(0) systems applied to dechlorination of CCl 4. These experiments involved (1) a smectite clay with Fe(III) in its structure that had been reduced to Fe(II) by dithionite treatment, (2) the same clay to which Fe(II) was added as an exchangeable cation, (3) electrolytic Fe(0) from Fisher, and (4) a mixture of the reduced clay and Fe(0). Experiments were conducted in headspace vials at pH 7 in either bicarbonate or bis-tris propane buffers. Reactant and product concentrations were determined by headspace analysis using GC/MS. Results from the first run of this experiment showed relatively little dechlorination by the Fe(II) system, and from 50 - 80 % dechlorination by the Fe(0) system after 48 h. Essentially no CHCl 3 was seen in the Fe(II) system, whereas as 30 % of the original CCl 4 was converted to CHCl 3 in the Fe(0) system. Very low amounts of CH 2 Cl 2 were seen in all treatments. Plans are underway to repeat this experiment and use a cryo-GC capability that will allow simultaneous determination of CO as well as the chlorinated methanes. This is important because CO represents the end product of the second hypothetical dechlorination pathway that may compete with the CHCl 3 pathway and will aid in mass balance calculations. An additional experiment to evaluate the Henry's Law constant for CCl 4 in aqueous solutions in the presence and absence of clay showed no significant difference due to the presence of clay, although slightly higher gas-phase concentrations were seen when clay was present...|$|R
40|$|Waste iron sulfate is {{produced}} in titanium dioxide manufacture and in steel pickling with sulfuric acid. Many processes have been proposed to use this waste {{as a source of}} chemicals or raw materials. The process developed here is based on the reaction with pure or waste calcium chloride (Solvay brine) to obtain iron(I 1) chloride and gypsum as a b y product. The iron chloride solution can either be directly oxidized to iron(II 1) chloride by reaction with chlorine or electrolyzcd to produce <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> and gaseous chlorine. The more interesting procedure is to electrolyze one-third of the iron(I 1) in solution and to oxidize the remainder with the chlorine obtained from the electrolysis. n...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Magneto {{rheological}} elastomer (MRE) is a {{new kind}} of smart materials. Its dynamic mechanical performances can be controlled by controlling an applied magnetic field. MRE is usually used as stiffness- changeable spring in the semi-active vibration absorber. In order to get perfect vibration control effect, low dynamic damping of MRE is needed. This paper presents a new method of fabricating isotropic MREs under normal temperature and pressure conditions. In the absence of a magnetic field, a variety of MR elastomer samples were prepared using Sylard’s 184 silicone elastomer along with un-annealed <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> power 500 mesh and 15 micron size. Their dynamic characteristics like fractional change in resonant frequency and fractional change in have been studied. The effects of iron particles and the applied magnetic field were investigated. This study is also expected to provide a good guide for designing and preparing new MR elastomers...|$|E

The {{influence}} of Nb and Ti in solid solution on the recrystallization mechanisms and textures of cold rolled high purity iron {{has been studied}} by optical metallography, SEM, microtexture (EBSD) and macrotexture (X-ray) measurements. Two UHP iron based alloys (Fe- 0. 08 wt % Nb and Fe- 0. 04 wt % Ti) together with two reference samples of UHP Fe and <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron,</b> were treated to form an equiaxed grain structure then rolled 81 % to develop standard bcc rolling textures. The recrystallization mechanisms were then studied by partial recrystallization anneals in the temperature range 475 - 800 °C. The orientations of the new recrystallized grain were essentially a mixture of { I 11) and {loo) parallel to the sheet planes.

40|$|A flow-injection {{procedure}} for spectrophotometric determination of phosphorus in <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> and iron alloys is proposed. The method {{is based on}} the ammonium molybdate reaction followed by stannous chloride reduction in acidic medium. In order to circumvent the severe interference caused by the major constituents such as Fe(III) and Cr(III), a mini-column packed with AG 50 W-X 8 resin was coupled to the manifold. A sample throughput of 40 determinations per hour, a dynamical range from P 0. 25 to 6. 00 mg L- 1, a reagent consumption of 25 mg ammonium molybdate and 2 mg stannous chloride per determination, and a relative standard deviation < 1 % (n = 10) for a typical sample with 2. 20 mg L- 1 P were achieved. Three different types of samples were used to evaluate system performance. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the results with certified values and no significant difference at 95 % confidence level was observed...|$|E
40|$|Elemental iron powders {{are widely}} used to fortify staple foods. This paper {{summarizes}} physical and chemical measurements that were conducted to assess the bioavailability of these iron powders relative to ferrous sulfate, along with validation of these assessments from a study with human subjects. Commercial elemental iron powders varied in bioavailability depending on the manufacturing process. Measurements of particle surface area and of solubility compared well with measurements conducted with animal absorption and with improvement of iron status in Thai women. The dissolution rate of the elemental iron powders in dilute acid, according to a standardized procedure, may be useful as an estimate of bioavailability. Carbonyl and <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> {{were found to have}} the best bioavailability of the iron powders, and reduced forms of iron were generally less bioavailable. This research will be useful in selecting iron products to fortify foods in areas of the world that need dietary iron fortification to fight a high incidence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia...|$|E
40|$|Fortification {{of cereal}} flours {{may be a}} useful public health {{strategy}} to combat iron deficiency. Cereal flours that are used shortly after production (e. g., baking flour) can be fortified with soluble iron compounds, such as ferrous sulfate, whereas the majority of flours stored for longer periods is usually fortified with elemental iron powders to avoid unacceptable sensory changes. Elemental iron powders are less well absorbed than soluble iron compounds and they vary widely in their absorption depending on manufacturing method and physicochemical characteristics. Costs vary with powder type, but elemental iron powders are generally less expensive than ferrous sulfate. This review evaluates {{the usefulness of the}} different elemental iron powders based on results from in vitro studies, rat assays, human bioavailability studies, and efficacy studies monitoring iron status in human subjects. It concludes that, at the present time, only <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> powder can be recommended as an iron fortificant. Because it is only approximately half as well absorbed as ferrous sulfate, it should be added to provide double the amount of iro...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a magnetic material which {{is well suited}} {{to the construction of}} cores in small inductance coils and transformers such as are used in a telephone system. These iron powder cores were made from Mesh <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>Iron</b> Powder. The material was annealed then insulated by oxidizing the surface of the individual particles. In this way a very thin and insulation grains iron was obtained, which did not break down when the cores were compressed. A shellac solution was applied to the insulated powder as a further insulator and binder. This was the way that toroidal iron powder cores were manufactured by Western Electric Company until about 1929. The iron powder of today are manufactured much the same way, using highly pure iron powder and a more exotic insulator and binder. prepared powder is compressed under extremely high pressures to produce a solid-looking core. This process creates a magnetic structure with a distributed air-gap. The inherent high saturation flux density iron combined with the distributed air-gap produces a core material with initia...|$|E
40|$|It is {{presented}} an experimental study about thermal conductivity in gray iron and compacted graphite iron. Thermal conductivity of the specimen {{is measured by}} a comparative method with stationary axial heat flow according to ASTM E 1225. The investigated specimen is put in a stack in tight thermal contact with two reference materials of same diameter. The upper reference specimen is coupled to a heat source, the lower reference to a heat sink. A guard heater and other experimental setup minimize radial heat losses. Reference material is <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> with certified thermal conductivity. Two gray irons were tested, the first alloyed with CuSnCr and the second with CuSnCrMo. Two grades of compacted graphite iron were also tested, CGI 350 and CGI 450. The tests were conducted up to 400 C. The results show that thermal conductivity decreases in the following sequence: CuSnCr gray iron, CuSnCrMo gray iron, CGI 350, CGI 450. The thermal conductivity results of the gray iron samples decrease with increasing temperatures, and are almost constant for the CGI samples. The results show the potential of using CGI 350 for applications like engine cylinder heads...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} nanostructured oxides and {{phosphates}} of Fe and atomically mixed Fe/Zn {{may be useful}} for nutritional applications. These compounds may have several advantages over existing fortificants, such as ferrous sulfate (FeSO(4)), NaFeEDTA and <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron.</b> Because of their very low solubility and formation of soft agglomerates of micron size at neutral pH {{as well as their}} light native color, they tend to be less reactive in difficult-to-fortify foods and thus have superior sensory performance. At gastric pH the soft agglomerates break up and the Fe compounds rapidly and completely dissolve due to their very high surface area. This results in in vitro solubility and in vivo bioavailability comparable to FeSO(4). Doping with Mg and/or Ca may increase solubility and improve sensory characteristics by lightening color. Feeding the nanostructured compounds at 150 - 400 mu g Fe day(- 1) for 15 days to weanling rats in two studies did not induce measurable histological or biochemical adverse effects. No significant Fe was detected in the submucosa of the gastrointestinal tract or lymphatic tissues, suggesting that the nanosized Fe is absorbed through usual non-heme Fe absorption pathways. Thus, these novel compounds show promise as food fortificants or supplements...|$|E
40|$|Anemia {{is common}} among {{children}} in sub-Saharan Africa and its etiology is multifactorial. Likely causes of anemia are low bioavailability of dietary iron, malaria, and helminth infection. In this study, we aimed {{to assess the}} effect of iron fortification, intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) of malaria, and anthelmintic treatment on hemoglobin concentration and anemia prevalence among school children. The study was a 6 -mo, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial enrolling 591 6 - to 14 -y-old school children in Côte d'Ivoire using the following: 1) iron-fortified biscuits providing an additional 20 mg iron/d as <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> 4 times/wk; 2) IPT of malaria with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine at 0 and 3 mo; and 3) anthelmintic treatment at 0 and 3 mo as the interventions. Prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency, malaria parasitemia, and helminth infection was 70. 4, 9. 3, 57. 7, and 54. 8 %, respectively. Iron fortification did not improve iron status, IPT of malaria did not affect malaria burden, and neither {{had an impact on}} anemia prevalence. Anthelmintics significantly reduced the burden of helminth infections and decreased anemia prevalence (odds ratio: 0. 4, 95 % CI: 0. 3, 0. 7). The low prevalence of iron deficiency and an extended dry season that decreased malaria transmission likely reduced the potential impact of iron fortification and IPT. In this setting, anthelmintic treatment was the only intervention that modestly decreased rates of anemi...|$|E
40|$|<b>Electrolytic</b> <b>iron</b> and {{crystalline}} electrode graphite or non-graphitizing carbon materials (furnace {{and channel}} carbon blacks, furan resin carbon and saccharose carbon) with different facility of graphitization compared with electrode graphite, {{were subjected to}} carburizing treatment at 1573 K or 1873 K in a {{high frequency induction furnace}} in vacuum. The influences of various carbon materials on the properties of cast iron melt were investigated by examining the micro-structure and the average carbon contents of samples obtained. In the case of electrode graphite, although carburizing into solid iron was very difficult, the dispersion of graphite into liquid iron occured easily and thus the electrode graphite promoted the nucleation and growth of stable graphite-γ eutectic. In the case of non-graphitizing carbon materials, although carburizing into solid and liquid iron was easier with a decrease in the degree of graphitization, and the dispersion of carbon matelials into liquid iron were promoted with an increase in the degree of graphitization. The nucleation and growth of graphite-γ eutectic were more difficult with a decrease in the degree of graphitization, while those of the metastable cementite-γ eutectic were promoted. Though carbon content in the melts at 1873 K hardly changed for all carbon meterials, their behavior to the iron differed remarkably by the sort of carbon precursor and graphitization temperature of carbon materials. These facts indicate clearly that the properties of carburized melt (the state of the presence of carbon-microgroups) depend on the structural characteristics of carbon materials...|$|E

Photographs pasted in. Typescript. Includes bibliographical references. At the Sixth Congress of the International Association for Testing Materials, no less than eight papers were submitted dealing with electrical and magnetic properties of various steels and alloy-steels, but comparatively few of these papers were concerned with the micro metallographic relation of these properties. The last year, however, has witnessed a marked interest in {{this phase of the}} science and papers by Langenberg and Weber, and by Yenseng, using medium-carbon steel and purified <b>electrolytic</b> <b>iron,</b> respectively, show that the practical possibilities of the work are being recognized. If certain microstructures were known to correspond with certain definite electrical or magnetic properties, a simple polishing, etching and examination of the substance might take the place of a lengthy, delicate and complex magnetic or electrical measurement. This method might be applied to the testing of iron and alloy steels used for electrical machinery, now being accomplished by electrical methods more or less complicated and lengthy. The amount of steel and alloys consumed for electrical machinery is {{a large proportion of the}} total steel output and there is decided competition in manufacturing the best grades of irons and steels for electrical use. This paper is the result of an endeavor to correlate the micro-structure of Silicon steel and its electrical and magnetic losses for which no data exist.
