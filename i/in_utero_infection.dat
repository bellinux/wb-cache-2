40|$|Twenty-six calves, {{born from}} 25 Anaplasma-infected, intact and splenectomized cows, from a herd kept under strict tick-free {{laboratory}} conditions, were monitored {{for the presence}} of Anaplasma antibodies, using the rapid card agglutination test. Serum was collected at birth, weekly for 12 weeks, and then monthly for approximately 6 months. Specific antibodies passively acquired could be detected in calf sera for an average period of 8 weeks after birth. Calves that remained positive for longer than 12 weeks were suspected of having contracted <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> <b>infections.</b> Infection of the calves was confirmed by splenectomy. It was concluded that 4 calves in Group I contracted <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> <b>infections.</b> Two of the dams were chronically infected, whilst the other 2 underwent acute primary reactions during the 1 st and 2 nd trimesters of gestation, respectively. Subsequently all calves born from infected cows in this tick-free herd were serologically screened before being splenectomized at an average age of 8 months. Out of 50 cows, 8 <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> infected calves were identified serologically and this finding was confirmed through splenectomy or subinoculation of blood. Both Anaplasma centrale and Anaplasma marginate were carried transplacentally. Splenectomized and intact cows, chronically infected or undergoing primary reactions during the 1 st, 2 nd or 3 rd trimester of gestation, produced infected calves. A 15, 6 % incidence of <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> transmitted <b>infections</b> were observed amongst 77 calves under these conditions.

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the genetic diversity of the transmitted virus after <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> transmission and after peripartum transmission and to compare the viral heterogeneity in the child with the viral heterogeneity in the mother. To allow a very accurate characterization of the viral heterogeneity in a single sample, limiting-dilution sequencing of a 1, 016 -bp fragment of the env gene was performed. Thirteen children were tested, including 6 with <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> <b>infections</b> and 7 with peripartum infections. Samples were taken the day after birth and at the ages of 6 and 14 weeks.

40|$|The {{initial stages}} of {{infection}} of pregnant mice at gestation day 11 with either the T 48 strain of Ross River virus or avirulent Semliki Forest virus are similar. With both infections, a hematogenous spread of virus to the placenta occurs. The viruses subsequently replicate to high titer in all placentas {{and are able to}} persist in the presence of specific maternal antiviral antibodies. There is a delay of at least 1 to 2 days between the initial detection of virus in the placenta and the onset of fetal infection. With Semliki Forest virus, abortion occurred in all mothers and appeared to be preceded by infection of all fetuses. However, when Semliki Forest virus was given at other stages of pregnancy, abortion was less common, and in all non-aborted pregnancies at least one uninfected fetus was observed. This situation was similar to that with Ross River virus, in which abortion was not observed and fetal infection and death were only seen in a proportion of fetuses. Within each pregnancy, the outcome of the two <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> <b>infections</b> appeared to result from similar mechanisms, with the fate of an individual fetus depending upon the timing of the passive transfer of anti-viral immunoglobulin G from the mother relative to the timing of fetal infection by virus from the placenta.

50|$|In general, serologic {{procedures}} are recommended for diagnosis only when tissues from mummified fetuses {{are not available}} for testing as previously described. Results with maternal sera are of value if antibody is not detected, thus excluding PPV as a cause, and if samples collected at intervals reveal seroconversion for PPV coincident with reproductive failure. Because PPV is ubiquitous, the presence of antibody in a single sample is otherwise meaningless. However, a determination of relative amounts of antibody present as immunoglobulin M and G can indicate the recency of infection. Detection of antibody in sera of fetuses and stillborn pigs and in sera collected from neonatal pigs before they nurse is evidence of <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> <b>infection,</b> since maternal antibody does not cross the maternal-fetal junction. When serum is not available, body fluids collected from fetuses or their viscera that have been kept {{in a plastic bag}} overnight at 4?C have been used successfully to demonstrate antibody.|$|E
50|$|Contaminated {{premises}} {{are probably}} major reservoirs of PPV. The virus is thermostable, is resistant to many common disinfectants, and may remain infectious for months in secretions and excretions from acutely infected pigs. It was shown experimentally that although pigs transmitted PPV {{for only about}} 2 weeks after exposure, the pens {{in which they were}} initially kept remained infectious for at least 4 months. The ubiquity of PPV also raises the possibility that some pigs are persistently infected and at least periodically shed virus. However, shedding beyond the interval of acute infection has not been demonstrated. The possibility of immunotolerant carriers of PPV as a result of early <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> <b>infection</b> has been suggested. When gilts were infected with PPV before day 55 of gestation, their pigs were born infected but without antibody. Virus was isolated from kidneys, testicles, and seminal fluid of such pigs killed at various times after birth up to the time they were 8 months of age; at which time the experiment was terminated. Results of another study, wherein dams were infected early in gestation and their pigs were born infected but without antibody, also suggest an acquired immunotolerance.

The vast {{majority}} of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. Numerous articles indicate that breast tumors exhibit diverse phenotypes depending on their distinct physiopathological signatures, clinical courses and therapeutic possibilities. The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a multifaceted highly host specific betaherpesvirus that is regarded as asymptomatic or mildly pathogenic virus in immunocompetent host. HCMV may cause serious <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> <b>infections</b> as well as acute and chronic complications in immunocompromised individual. The involvement of HCMV in late inflammatory complications underscores its possible role in inflammatory diseases and cancer. HCMV targets a variety of cell types in vivo, including macrophages, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, stromal cells, neuronal cells, smooth muscle cells, and hepatocytes. HCMV can be detected in the milk after delivery and thereby HCMV could spread to adjacent mammary epithelial cells.

40|$|During pregnancy, {{generalized}} {{infection of}} the mother with viremia may lead to {{infection of the}} fetus. When the virus is cytopathic, the resultant injury usually leads to fetal death and abortion. On the other hand, infection with a relatively noncytopathic virus may not kill the fetus but can cause damage to tissues in utero or shortly after birth. Although congenital viral infections are not uncommon (1) and are important in human disease (i. e. rubella and cytomegalovirus infections), the pathogenetic mechanism(s) of injury remain unclear.

40|$|Preterm birth {{increases}} the risk of adverse birth outcomes and {{is the leading cause of}} neonatal mortality. A significant cause of preterm birth is <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> <b>infection</b> with vaginal microorganisms. These vaginal microorganisms are often recovered from the amniotic fluid of preterm birth cases. A vaginal microorganism frequently associated with preterm birth is group B streptococcus (GBS), or Streptococcus agalactiae. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying GBS ascension are poorly understood. Here, we describe the role of the GBS hyaluronidase in ascending infection and preterm birth. We show that clinical GBS strains associated with preterm labor or neonatal infections have increased hyaluronidase activity compared to commensal strains obtained from rectovaginal swabs of healthy women. Using a murine model of ascending infection, we show that hyaluronidase activity was associated with increased ascending GBS infection, preterm birth, and fetal demise. Interestingly, hyaluronidase activity reduced uterine inflammation but did not impact placental or fetal inflammation. Our study shows that hyaluronidase activity enables GBS to subvert uterine immune responses, leading to increased rates of ascending infection and preterm birth.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) is now {{the most}} common cause of viral intrauterine infection. Fetal damage is mostly linked to maternal primary infection. It is therefore important to differentiate primary from recurrent or persistent HCMV infection in pregnant females. For this purpose, IgM tests are not reliable enough and the measurement of the IgG avidity appears to be presently the best method. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of the measurement of HCMV-IgG avidity by a 8 M urea denaturation assay in predicting congenital infection in the offspring. STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-eight women were included in this study on the basis of a HCMV IgM positive or equivocal result on a first serum during pregnancy, but without a documented seroconversion history. The IgG avidity was measured and correlated with the outcome of the pregnancy. RESULTS: In eight cases of HCMV <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> <b>infection</b> the maternal HCMV-IgG avidity index was below 50 %. One case of HCMV <b>in</b> <b>utero</b> <b>infection</b> was observed despite a high avidity index during the second trimester of the pregnancy. High or intermediate HCMV-IgG avidity indexes during the first trimester of pregnancy were not associated with a congenital infection. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the presence of an IgM positive result, an HCMV IgG avidity index above 65 % on a serum obtained during the first trimester of pregnancy could reasonably be considered as a good indicator of past HCMV infection.
