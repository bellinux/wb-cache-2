40|$|The {{problem of}} {{volatile}} {{sources in the}} martian atomosphere was studied. It is suggested {{that a combination of}} an impact by an icy planetesimal (radius about 150 km) and solar wind implantation of neon could explain the noble gas abundances on Venus. Early solar wind would supply the right amount of neon with the correct Ne- 20 /Ne- 22 as compared with lunar soils. However, observations of noble gases in a <b>fresh</b> <b>comet</b> are needed to test this hypothesis...|$|E
50|$|As {{is typical}} for <b>comets</b> <b>fresh</b> from the Oort Cloud, its orbital {{solution}} {{is more or}} less parabolic; if its orbit is in fact closed, it will likely not return for millions of years.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, the Capras {{team that}} participated in the Queensland Cup changed their name to the Comets Rugby League Football Club. With a new name and <b>fresh</b> look, the <b>Comets</b> have {{represented}} the top level of football in Central Queensland for six years. (The Capras still remains as the name for the Central Queensland representative sides).|$|R
40|$|Activity of most comets {{near the}} Sun is {{dominated}} by sublimation of frozen water, the most abundant ice in comets. Some comets, however, are active well beyond the water-ice sublimation limit of ~ 3 AU. Three bodies dominate the observational record and modeling efforts for distantly active comets: the long-period comet C/ 1995 O 1 Hale-Bopp and the short-period comets (with Centaur orbits) 29 P/Schwassmann Wachmann 1 and 2060 Chiron. We summarize {{what is known about}} these three objects emphasizing their gaseous comae. We calculate their CN/CO and CO 2 /CO production rate ratios from the literature and discuss implications. Using our own data we derive CO production rates for all three objects, in order to examine a correlation between gas production and different orbital histories and/or size. We find that orbital history does not appear to {{play a significant role in}} explaining 29 P's CO production rates. 29 P outproduces Hale-Bopp at the same heliocentric distance, even though it has been subjected to much more solar heating. Previous modeling work on such objects predicts that 29 P should have been de-volatilized over a <b>fresher</b> <b>comet</b> like Hale-Bopp. This may point to 29 P having a different orbital history than current models predict, with its current orbit acquired more recently. On the other hand, Chiron's CO measurements are consistent with it being significantly depleted over its original state, perhaps due to increased radiogenic heating made possible by its much larger size or its higher processing due to orbital history. Observed spectral line profiles are consistent with development and sublimation of icy grains at about 5 - 6 AU for 29 P and Hale-Bopp, and this is probably a common feature in distantly active comets, and an important source of volatiles for all comets within 5 AU. In contrast, the narrow CO line profiles indicate a nuclear, and not extended, origin for CO beyond ~ 4 AU. Comment: 20 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables.

6000|$|And so Leith Clay-Randolph came to Idlewild to stay, {{how long}} I did not dream. Nor did I dream how often {{he was to}} come, for he was like an erratic <b>comet.</b> <b>Fresh</b> he would arrive, and cleanly clad, from grand folk who were his friends as I was his friend, and again, weary and worn, he would creep up the brier-rose path from the Montanas or Mexico. And without a word, when his {{wanderlust}} gripped him, he was off and away into that great mysterious underworld he called [...] "The Road." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{proportions of}} the cometary and the asteroidal contributions to the interplanetary dust {{have not yet been}} definitively established. These proportions may vary with time as a result of major catastrophic disruptions in the main belt or the appearance of <b>fresh,</b> active <b>comets.</b> Dermott et al. and Reach suggest the debris from catastrophic collisions in the main belt can account for most of the zodiacal cloud particles. Earth collection of these asteroidal particles is strongly favored by near-Earth gravitational enhancement. However, comets are observed to produce interplanetary dust particles (IDP's), and the identification of cometary IDP's would allow inferences of the compositions, mineralogies, and physical properties of the comets. The peak temperatures reached by IDP's on atmospheric entry indicate the distribution of IDP velocities. Each IDP contains many internal thermometers: minerals that transform above certain temperatures, volatile elements that are lost sequentially with increasing temperatures, solar flare tracks that anneal at different temperatures in different minerals, and solar-implanted noble gases that outgas progressively with temperature. Thus, limits on the peak temperature reached by each IDP on Earth atmospheric entry can be set. Other aspects of this investigation are covered...|$|R
