2500|$|Vancomycin is {{recommended}} {{to be administered}} in a dilute solution slowly, over at least 60 min (maximum rate of 10mg/min for doses >500mg) due to {{the high incidence of}} pain and thrombophlebitis and to avoid an <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> known as the [...] "red man syndrome" [...] or [...] "red neck syndrome". This syndrome, usually appearing within 4 to 10min after the commencement or soon after the completion of an infusion, is characterized by flushing and/or an erythematous rash that affects the face, neck, and upper torso. These findings are due to interaction of vancomycin with MRGPRX2, a GPCR mediating IgE-independent mast cell degranulation. Less frequently, hypotension and angioedema may also occur. Symptoms may be treated or prevented with antihistamines, including diphenhydramine, and are less likely to occur with slow infusion.|$|E
40|$|Background: Infusion {{reactions}} {{have been}} associated with infliximab therapy, but no study has assessed how physicians treat and manage this common adverse event. Goals: To determine how gastroenterologists manage infusion reactions, identify prophylactic pretreatment protocols, and determine infliximab treatment persistence in the presence of infusion reactions. Method: This retrospective multicenter chart review analyzed data from adults younger than 90 years {{at the time of their}} first infliximab infusion from 9 academic or community-based gastroenterology practices. <b>Infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> rates were compared using a Chi-square test with Yates' correction. Kaplan-Meier methods assessed infliximab treatment persistency. Results: Among 6, 468 infusions with known <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> status administered to 447 patients, 3. 5 % (226 / 6, 468) of infusions resulted in an <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction,</b> and less than 0. 1 % (2 / 6, 468) were associated with a serious <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction.</b> Among all patients, 19. 7 % (88 / 447) experienced at least 1 <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction,</b> whereas 0. 4 % (2 / 447) experienced a serious <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction.</b> Patients receiving concomitant immunosuppressives had fewer infusion reactions compared to patients not receiving them (57 / 322 patients, 17. 7 % vs 31 / 125 patients, 24. 8 %; P=. 118). The cumulative proportion of patients continuing infliximab therapy at 2, 4, and 5 years was 73 %, 58 %, and 54 %, respectively. Conclusions: The incidence of serious infusion reactions was low.

40|$|Objective: We {{report the}} {{incidence}} {{and treatment of}} <b>infusion</b> <b>reactions</b> to infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal IgG 1 antibody against tumor necrosis factor a, in a large cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients and methods: One hundred eighty six patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with infliximab {{for a total of}} 216. 6 patient years were retrospectively evaluated. Patients received 2160 infliximab infusions at the Division of Rheumatology at the University Hospital of Padua from May, 2000 to April, 2004. Specific treatment protocols for initial and subsequent acute <b>infusion</b> <b>reactions</b> were followed and the outcomes documented. Results: The overall incidence of <b>infusion</b> <b>reactions</b> to infliximab was 0. 8 % (19 out of 2160 of infusions), affecting 10. 2 % of patients (19 out of 186). Mild, moderate, or severe acute reactions occurred in 0. 1 % (3 of 2160), 0. 6 % (13 of 2160), and 0. 04 % (1 of 2160) of infliximab infusions, respectively. Delayed <b>infusion</b> <b>reactions</b> occurred in 0. 09 % (2 of 2160) of infusions. Use of specific treatment protocols resulted in rapid resolution of all acute reactions to infliximab.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Scheduled {{maintenance}} therapy with infliximab decreases {{the risk of}} <b>infusion</b> <b>reactions.</b> Many centers have accelerated infusion times to 1 h in selected patients who tolerate 5 mg/kg infliximab infusions. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the tolerability of 1 -h and 2 -h infliximab infusions in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in a large single-center cohort. The primary end point was the incidence of <b>infusion</b> <b>reactions</b> in both groups. METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis of all IBD patients treated with infliximab was performed. Infusions in scheduled maintenance for at least 6 months from December 1994 until March 2009 were included. All patients were treated at the infusion unit or during hospitalization under standard operating procedures. Infusion parameters were prospectively recorded. From 2004, in patients tolerating at least four 2 -h infusions, infusions were given over 1 h. RESULTS: As of March 2009, 953 patients with IBD (77. 6 % Crohn's disease, 22. 4 % ulcerative colitis) had been treated with infliximab. A total of 474 patients met the criteria of scheduled {{maintenance therapy}}. In total, 9, 155 maintenance infusions were administered (4, 307 over 1 h). No severe <b>infusion</b> <b>reactions</b> were documented. Mild acute reactions occurred in 0. 6 % (27 / 4, 307) of the 1 -h-infusion group and in 1. 7 % (80 / 4848) of the 2 -h infusion group (P = 0. 0034). Delayed <b>infusion</b> <b>reactions</b> occurred in 0. 2 % of 1 -h and 0. 5 % of 2 -h infusion group patients (P = 0. 277). Loss of tolerability due to <b>infusion</b> <b>reactions</b> (1 -h group 2. 9 % versus 2 -h group 4. 1 %) was evenly distributed (P = 0. 34). None of the prespecified variables were predictive of <b>infusion</b> <b>reactions</b> in a multivariate analysis.

Our aim {{was to assess the}} frequency and characteristics of infusion reactions during CT-P 13 therapy in 13 Hungarian and 1 Czech IBD centres. METHODS: Clinical and safety data was registered at fixed appointments. Trough levels and anti-drug antibody (ADA) concentration were measured by ELISA. Association between demographic, clinical, laboratory parameters and <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> rates were evaluated statistically. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-four IBD patients were included. Twenty-eight Hungarian IBD patients (9. 6 %) developed <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> during the treatment, 64. 3 % of them was previously exposed to anti TNF therapy. No <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> occurred in the Czech population. CT-P 13 therapy had to be stopped in 17 patients who developed <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> and was switched to adalimumab in 12 patients. However in 39. 3 % of patients developing <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> CT-P 13 therapy was continued with the use of premedication. Cumulative ADA positivity rates were 8. 7 %, 19. 3 %, and 28. 0 % at weeks 0, 14, and 30.

The possible factors including Fcγ receptor (FcγR) polymorphism associated {{with the development of}} infusion reactions in patients with RA receiving infl iximab were prospectively examined. Methods 96 patients with RA were enrolled and scheduled to receive infl iximab at a dose of 3 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2 and 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter. Genetic polymorphisms for FcγR were examined in FCGR 3 A 176 F/V and FCGR 3 B NA 1 / 2 alleles by allele-specifi c PCR analysis. Results An <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> was observed in 17 patients (18 %) during 52 weeks of treatment with infl iximab. The FCGR 3 B NA 1 /NA 1 genotype was found in 75 % of the patients with infusion reactions and in only 37 % of those without (p= 0. 01), whereas the FCGR 3 A 176 F/V genotype was equally distributed in the patients with or without infusion reactions. Glucocorticoids were used in 53 % of the patients who developed an <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> and in 80 % of those without an <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> (p= 0. 02). A multivariable logistic regression model showed that the FCGR 3 B NA 1 /NA 1 genotype and use of glucocorticoids at baseline could be used as independent predictive factors for infusion reactions (OR 6. 1 (95 % CI 1. 9 to 24. 3) and OR 0. 26 (95 % CI 0. 08 to 0. 84), respectively). The presence of anti-infl iximab antibody during infl iximab treatment was also associated with infusion reactions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Treatment with infliximab, a {{chimeric}} monoclonal IgG 1 antibody against tumor necrosis factor, {{can result}} {{in the formation of}} antibodies against infliximab. We evaluated the clinical significance of these antibodies in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: In a cohort of 125 consecutive patients with Crohn's disease who were treated with infliximab infusions, we evaluated the concentrations of infliximab and of antibodies against infliximab, clinical data, side effects (including infusion reactions), and the use of concomitant medications before and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after each infusion. RESULTS: A mean of 3. 9 infusions (range, 1 to 17) per patient were administered over a mean period of 10 months. Antibodies against infliximab were detected in 61 percent of patients. The presence of concentrations of 8. 0 microg per milliliter or greater before an infusion predicted a shorter duration of response (35 days, as compared with 71 days among patients with concentrations of less than 8. 0 microg per milliliter; P< 0. 001) and a higher risk of infusion reactions (relative risk, 2. 40; 95 percent confidence interval, 1. 65 to 3. 66; P< 0. 001). Infliximab concentrations were significantly lower at four weeks among patients who had had an <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> than among patients who had never had an <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> (median, 1. 2 vs. 14. 1 microg per milliliter; P< 0. 001).

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} have {{a unique}} potential for a non- allergic <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> caused by cytokine release. Recognition and expert management of a cytokine-release re- action may enable patients to be rechallenged with the mono-clonal antibody, potentially improving clinical outcome. The safety of rapid infusions of rituximab is under investiga- tion, and initial findings of several trials reported that after successful first-cycle dosing according to manufacturer’s protocol, subsequent doses may be delivered by rapid infusion. C ancer therapies administered by IV infusion may cause infusion reactions. Infusion reactions always involve the immune system; however, some (of-ten called anaphylactic) are allergic in nature and typically are mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE), whereas others (anaphylactoid) are not true allergic reactions and are not mediated by IgE (Kemp, Lockey, & Simons, 2008). Regardless of whether the reaction is allergic or nonallergic, clinical manifestations are the same and require prompt, ac-curate assessment and astute management to prevent severe adverse events, which can include death. Understanding the pathophysiology underlying each <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> will en-hance decision making regarding rechallenge, thus potentially improving treatment outcomes. Monoclonal antibodies are a valuable treatment component for {{many different types of}} cancers as well as nonmalignant disorders. Monoclonal antibodies also {{have a unique}} side-effect profile and generally are better tolerated than chemotherapy in the author’s experience. A distinctive side effect of monoclonal antibodies is the potential for nonallergic infusion reactions caused by cytokine release.

40|$|Patients and methods: A prospective, multicentre, randomised, {{double blind}} phase 4 study of 355 {{patients}} with RA in two groups: group A received betamethasone and group B placebo, before a 36 week infusion treatment with infliximab.

50|$|No safety {{concerns}} were detected {{in any of}} the studies. A few patients suffered from mild <b>infusion</b> <b>reactions</b> that resolved on their own. The measured laboratory values and vital signs, showed no changes. Other adverse events that occurred, e.g., headache or hematoma, where not considered as related to treatment.|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} infliximab combined with weekly methotrexate in drug-naive recent-onset dermatomyositis and polymyositis. Methods: A multi-centre open-label controlled trial was conducted. Disease activity was assessed using patient's and physician's disease activity assessment, manual muscle testing (MMT), hand-held dynamometry, and serum CK. The primary objective {{was to assess the}} efficacy using MMT after a period of 26 weeks. Results: The study was terminated prematurely because of a low inclusion rate and a high drop-out rate due to disease progression and the occurrence of an <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction.</b> The few patients who did reach the primary endpoint showed improvement in all aspects studied. Conclusion: Infliximab combined with weekly methotrexate might be safe and well tolerated in a small subgroup of patients with drug-naive recent-onset myositis. At present, we do not advocate the use of this treatment because treatment response cannot be predicted beforehand. Copyright (C) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|E
40|$|Infliximab, the {{chimeric}} antibody to tumor necrosis factor-alpha, is indicated for medically refractory pediatric Crohn disease. Aim {{of our study}} was to examine the efficacy and side effects of infliximab therapy in Hungarian pediatric patients with Crohn disease since the authorisation of medicine for children to 31. 12. 2008. 23 children with refractory Crohn disease received infliximab during this period. Induction therapy with 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6 was introduced. 18 patients (81. 8 %) achieved clinical response, and 13 patients (59. 1 %) were in remission at the 6 th week of the observation period. The evaluation was based on data of 22 children. Fistula closure rate was 70 % at the at the 6 th week. Two patients had acute <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction,</b> one had severe anaphilactic reaction after infliximab infusion. Chronic side effects were also observed in three cases. In our study infliximab induction therapy was effective in most pediatric patients with therapy refractory Crohn disease...|$|E
40|$|Hidradenitis suppurativa is {{a chronic}} disease {{that affects the}} apocrine gland-bearing regions of the body. The {{etiology}} of this disorder is poorly understood, but most likely is a complex process involving follicular apocrine occlusion with subsequent perifolliculitis. Many treatment options have been reported {{with varying degrees of}} success, including topical and oral therapy and surgical procedures. Recently, TNF-α antagonists have been reported as effective therapy in a few patients. We report here a patient who initially responded to infliximab but developed an <b>infusion</b> <b>reaction</b> to this medication. After subsequent treatment with adalimumab, the patient’s disease improved dramatically and has been maintained under excellent control for over 15 months. We propose that TNF-α inhibitors, particularly monoclonal antibody based agents, are a viable treatment option in patients with severe, recalcitrant HS and that a patient may be safely and successfully treated with the fully human monoclonal antibody adalimumab in cases in which the chimeric monoclonal antibody infliximab therapy is not tolerated...|$|E

40|$|Background: This Phase Ib dose-escalating study {{investigated}} safety, {{maximum tolerated dose}} (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical antitumour activity of tosedostat (CHR- 2797), an orally bioavailable aminopeptidase inhibitor, in combination with paclitaxel. Methods: A total of 22 patients received paclitaxel (135 - 175 mg m 2) intravenously, administered once every three weeks {{for up to six}} cycles, with oral tosedostat (90 - 240 mg) daily. Results: One DLT (grade 3 dyspnoea) was observed in one patient with tosedostat 180 mg combined with paclitaxel 175 mg m 2. A high number of paclitaxel <b>infusion</b> <b>reactions</b> was noted during the second administration (59 %) and this prompted interruption of tosedostat dosing for 5 days around every second and subsequent paclitaxel infusion. No formal MTD was determined because of the high frequency of paclitaxel <b>infusion</b> <b>reactions</b> that may have been influenced by tosedostat. Most frequently observed drug-related adverse events were alopecia, fatigue (95 % each), peripheral sensory neuropathy (59 %), paclitaxel hypersensitivity (59 %) and rash (55 %). One patient died because of eosinophilic myocarditis, possibly related to study medication. There was no PK interaction between tosedostat and paclitaxel. In all, 3 patients had a partial response and 12 patients had stable disease lasting 3 months. Conclusion: The combination of tosedostat with paclitaxel was well tolerated except for the high incidence of paclitaxel-related <b>infusion</b> <b>reactions.</b> © 2010 Cancer Research UK...|$|R
