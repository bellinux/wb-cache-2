40|$|M. A. <b>The</b> <b>nude</b> is {{generally}} approached {{as a historical}} and cultural product of specific societies, while a generic conception of <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> as a genre of gendered art (Gill Saunders, 1989), rather than as form (Kenneth Clark, 1956) is more vaguely perceived in underlying assumptions <b>in</b> texts on <b>the</b> <b>nude,</b> and <b>the</b> works themselves. The tradition of <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> is extremely varied, and complex. My purpose is not to unify or simplify this tradition. Any nude is never one thing alone, but is subject to interpretation. <b>The</b> <b>nude,</b> largely through recent feminist interpretations, has come to fulfil the role of trustee for alterity (Lynda Nead, 1992). By considering <b>the</b> main typologies <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> has been studied and interpreted, I hope to show the importance and significance of gender in art, aesthetics, and finally, philosophy. The significance of this thesis is to confront the antagonism between traditional and contemporary feminist issues {{and that of the}} standard patriarchal tradition. <b>In</b> this regard <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> is an interesting and rewarding genre of the expression of gender, as it deals with the delicate concerns of this category. The central problematic of the research is the question of gender. On an epistemological level, feminism 'introduces' the category of gender, which subverts and challenges all previous conceptions of the human subject. While I wish to bear <b>in</b> mind <b>the</b> history of oppression through the neglect and negation of the category of gender, I also recognise the vital importance of moving beyond this structure by proposing the celebration of plurality through more life-affirming readings of nudity in art. Although femeneutics may sound idiosyncratic, I propose to use the term as shorthand for feminist studies combined with a hermeneutic approach...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the success}} of Cleopatra, {{over the next decade}} Etty tried to {{replicate}} its success by painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nude figures. While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice.

5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{an update}} to the SEOC Act, the Child Protection Act of 1984, made {{it illegal to}} {{purchase}} pornographic materials depicting minors through the mail, or possess them, {{on the grounds that}} it encouraged child sexual abuse. While popular with voters, civil liberties advocates warned that the expanded scope of these laws could result in prosecutions of entirely innocent people who had little or nothing to do with the child-porn industry, such as parents taking photos or videos of their children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nude.</b> Nevertheless, investigators forged ahead and had, by the mid-1980s, shut down almost all domestic child-porn production. The government itself was thereafter the biggest marketer, in the form of materials it created to tempt buyers.|$|E

50|$|As {{well as the}} {{portrait}} work, one should certainly pause on Matutinović's work with <b>the</b> female <b>nude.</b> <b>The</b> body {{is a challenge to}} the sculptor. The first thing we notice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nudes</b> is <b>the</b> sculptorly interes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sum of impressions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mass itself. The choice of female body for this artist means less the male evocation of sensuality and beauty, desire and passion, and refers more to the experiencing of various situations in life - Fortune, 1956; Invitation to Love, 1957; Cry of Grief, 1959; Desire, 1972.By the end of 1980s he has participated in 25 group exhibitions. More than 30 of his works of art in bronze and in stone are exhibited in public, mainly outdoors. In mid-90s, he finally finishes his masterpiece in stone “Longing” (Figure 3).His works are on display in museums, galleries and private collections in Florence, Paris, Hong Kong and New York. He received three awards for his contribution to the development of fine arts. He is also enlisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yugoslav art encyclopaedia. Opportunities often take him from away from sculpture and into drawing. He paints family portraits, female nudes and illustrates books of his wife Ljerka Car Matutinović.|$|R

5|$|The Société des Gens des Lettres, a Parisian {{organization}} of writers, planned {{a monument to}} French novelist Honoré de Balzac immediately {{after his death in}} 1850. The society commissioned Rodin to create the memorial in 1891, and Rodin spent years developing the concept for his sculpture. Challenged in finding an appropriate representation of Balzac given the author's rotund physique, Rodin produced many studies: portraits, full-length figures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nude,</b> wearing a frock coat, or in a robe– a replica of which Rodin had requested. The realized sculpture displays Balzac cloaked in the drapery, looking forcefully into the distance with deeply gouged features. Rodin's intent had been to show Balzac at the moment of conceiving a work– to express courage, labor, and struggle.|$|E

30|$|The MA-XRF {{scanning}} {{performed on}} Dieu n’est pas un saint also provided elemental {{information about the}} overpainted sky. As shown <b>in</b> Fig.  5 <b>the</b> fluorescence emission of the Cr, Zn and PbL elements recorded all around the female figure seems related to the hidden sky and supports the use of Cr-based pigment(s), zinc white and lead white mixtures for its depiction.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> postmodern era, <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> has {{returned}} to gain some acceptance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> art world, but not necessarily the art model.

40|$|This practice-based {{project is}} an {{investigation}} of life drawing practice through the frameworks of choreography and theatre {{to examine the relationship}} of <b>the</b> constructed <b>nude</b> body to movement and space. <b>The</b> <b>nude</b> is generated through an embodied engagement in life drawing practice and the application of choreographic practice to the process of generating the artwork. From this, <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> is utilised as an alternative site to explore the potential instigation and organisation of action to reside. Using self-reflective observation, embodied feedback and the choreographic methods of William Forsythe and Xavier Le Roy, I consider <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> as a fiction based on a ‘language of <b>the</b> body’. <b>In</b> this thesis, I examine <b>the</b> processes <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> is interpreted and derived from the participation and performance of life-drawing practice. Further to this, choreographic processes are examined to consider <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> as a material object to be choreographed, highlighted by the presentation of <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> within a theatrical framework. Derived from the human form, <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> is a fiction in which its construction {{can be viewed as a}} choreographic process, and in experimenting with that process alternative ways of generating <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> can be examined. This project produces contemporary ‘alternative nudes’ by aligning choreography with the fundamental phenomenological dimension of drawing. This approach has demonstrated a collision between the inanimate and static with the kinetic and sensual. A brief history of <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> and ‘alternative nudes’ reveal that its construction and reception can be seen as a mirror of cultural and social ideology and beliefs. The artwork is a theatrical installation that combines drawing techniques, installation of scrims, motorised movement and computer coding. <b>In</b> examining <b>the</b> process of creating <b>the</b> fictional <b>nude</b> bodies choreographic techniques are evidenced and choreographic thinking can provide a means to account for how movement can open up <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> to new and more nuanced meaning. Subsequently, the understanding of movement and the body through choreographic thought can be aligned with the performance and theorisation of life drawing practice...|$|R

40|$|A {{picture of}} a nude {{isolated}} {{in a series of}} pictures of clothed models was quite memorable, but when compared with a clothed picture, <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> impaired memory for background picture details as well as pictures immediately following <b>the</b> <b>nude</b> (anterograde amnesia).
