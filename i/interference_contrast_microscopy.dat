25|$|A Wollaston prism {{is another}} {{birefringent}} polarizer {{consisting of two}} triangular calcite prisms with orthogonal crystal axes that are cemented together. At the internal interface, an unpolarized beam splits into two linearly polarized rays which leave the prism at a divergence angle of 15°–45°. The Rochon and Sénarmont prisms are similar, but use different optical axis orientations in the two prisms. The Sénarmont prism is air spaced, unlike the Wollaston and Rochon prisms. These prisms truly split the beam into two fully polarized beams with perpendicular polarizations. The Nomarski prism is {{a variant of the}} Wollaston prism, which is widely used in differential <b>interference</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>microscopy.</b>|$|E

50|$|Differential <b>interference</b> <b>contrast</b> (DIC) <b>{{microscopy}},</b> {{also known}} as Nomarski <b>interference</b> <b>contrast</b> (NIC) or Nomarski microscopy, is an optical microscopy technique used to enhance the contrast in unstained, transparent samples. DIC works {{on the principle of}} interferometry to gain information about the optical path length of the sample, to see otherwise invisible features. A relatively complex optical system produces an image with the object appearing black to white on a grey background. This image is similar to that obtained by phase <b>contrast</b> <b>microscopy</b> but without the bright diffraction halo. The technique was developed by Polish physicist Georges Nomarski in 1952.|$|R
40|$|Oxidative {{damage is}} {{implicated in the}} {{pathogenesis}} of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, and in normal aging. Here, we model oxidative stress in neurons using photogenerated radicals in a simplified membrane-encapsulated microtubule system. Using fluorescence and differential <b>interference</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>microscopies,</b> we monitor photochemically induced microtubule breakdown on the supported region of membrane in encapsulating synthetic liposomes {{as a function of}} lipid composition and environment. Degradation of vesicle-encapsulated microtubules is caused by attack from free radicals formed upon UV excitation of the lipid-soluble fluorescent probe, 6 -(9 -anthroyloxy) stearic acid. Probe concentration was typically limited to a regime in which microtubule degradation was slow, and microtubule degradation was monitored by changes in the observed protrusion of the membrane surface. The kinetics of microtubule degradation are influenced by lipid saturation level, fluorescent probe concentration, and the presence of free-radical scavengers. This system is sufficient to reproduce some degenerative morphologies found in vivo...|$|R
