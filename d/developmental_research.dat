25|$|Following on {{the seminal}} work of Martin and Synge in 1941, it was {{predicted}} by Cal Giddings, Josef Huber, {{and others in the}} 1960s that LC could be operated in the high-efficiency mode by reducing the packing-particle diameter substantially below the typical LC (and GC) level of 150 μm and using pressure to increase the mobile phase velocity. These predictions underwent extensive experimentation and refinement throughout the 60s into the 70s. Early <b>developmental</b> <b>research</b> began to improve LC particles, and the invention of Zipax, a superficially porous particle, was promising for HPLC technology.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{mentoring}} research has broadened from its traditional dyadic perspective {{to examine the}} support provided by a "developmental network. " This article reviews the literature on developmental networks—groups of people who take an active interest in and action toward advancing a protégé’s career. Building on positive organizational scholarship (POS) research on high-quality connections and relationships, the authors propose that a "mutuality perspective," or taking the viewpoints of {{all members of the}} developmental network into account, is a notable gap in <b>developmental</b> network <b>research.</b> They apply this perspective to <b>developmental</b> networks <b>research</b> and discuss implications and avenues for future inquiry. As part of their review, the authors clarify the boundaries of the developmental network construct. They also identify and discuss four research streams that encompass extant studies of developmental networks.

40|$|The {{specific}} {{purposes of}} the present paper are to locate self-concept and self-concept research in the broader contexts of: (a) educational and <b>developmental</b> psychological <b>research</b> as a whole; (b) {{a model of the}} self which takes onto account relevant findings from educational and <b>developmental</b> psychological <b>research,</b> and (c) a concurrent model of self-in-relationship which takes into account the influence of relationships on the development of self-concept. In fulfilling these specific purposes the paper attempts to provide an overarching theoretical and operational framework within which self-concept research may be located. This may facilitate the interpretation and evaluation of findings relating to self-concept research, especially in relation to other important constructs in educational and <b>developmental</b> psychological <b>research.</b> A Model of the Self When focussed on the individual as the unit of analysis, educational and developmental psychology, and related fields of study, have typically focussed on three dimensions of the self- needs, capacities, and beliefs. We briefly review each of these dimensions below, and then show how these dimensions may be integrated to form a model of the self.
