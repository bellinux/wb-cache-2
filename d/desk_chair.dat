He had his own office with a <b>desk,</b> <b>chair</b> and bunk bed. From the window he could see the lorries driving towards the gas chambers, and estimated that 10 percent of each transport was selected to work and the rest killed. By April 1944 he calculated that 1,750,000 Jews had been killed, a figure higher than that accepted by historians, but which decades later he still insisted was accurate.|$|E
5|$|Photographer Dick Matthews, {{a friend}} from the Jacaranda, heard about Harry's {{problems}} with Leach and introduced Harry to a local civil servant, Jim Anderson, who lent Harry £50. This enabled Harry to found Mersey Beat in 1961. Harry decided to publish the newspaper every two weeks, covering the music scene in Liverpool, Wirral, Birkenhead, New Brighton, Crosby and Southport, as well as Warrington, Widnes and Runcorn. He thought up the name Mersey Beat by thinking about a policeman's 'beat' (the area of duty), which {{had nothing to do}} with a musical beat. Virginia gave up her accountancy/comptometer operator job at Woolworth's and worked full-time for £2.10/- a week (also contributing a Mersey Roundabout article), while Harry lived on his Senior City Art Scholarship funding. Matthews photographed groups, while Anderson found a small attic office for £5 a week above David Land's wine merchant's shop at 81a Renshaw Street, Liverpool. Anderson and Matthews helped with the move to the new office, with Anderson providing a <b>desk,</b> <b>chair</b> and an Olivetti typewriter.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, {{eighteen}} years after Hubbard's death, the Church claimed eight million followers worldwide. According to religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, {{this is an}} overestimate, counting as Scientologists people who had merely bought a book. The City University of New York's American Religious Identification Survey found that by 2009 only 25,000 Americans identified as Scientologists. Hubbard's presence still pervades Scientology. Every Church of Scientology maintains an office reserved for Hubbard, with a <b>desk,</b> <b>chair</b> and writing equipment, ready to be used. Lonnie D. Kliever notes that Hubbard was [...] "the only source of the religion, {{and he has no}} successor". Hubbard is referred to simply as [...] "Source" [...] within Scientology and the theological acceptability of any Scientology-related activity is determined by how closely it adheres to Hubbard's doctrines. Hubbard's name and signature are official trademarks of the Religious Technology Center, established in 1982 to control and oversee the use of Hubbard's works and Scientology's trademarks and copyrights. The RTC is the central organization within Scientology's complex corporate hierarchy and has put much effort into re-checking the accuracy of all Scientology publications to [...] "ensur the availability of the pure unadulterated writings of Mr. Hubbard to the coming generations".|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{returns to}} Dunder Mifflin with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) to find Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) in the manager's chair. Andy enlists Robert California (James Spader) to give Andy his job back, which fails. Nellie further asserts her {{authority}} when she orders Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) to dock Andy's paycheck twice, and she complies. This causes Andy to have sexual performance difficulties with Erin. Erin asks Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{if he had}} similar problems after his loss of the manager position, which he denies. After Dwight tells Nellie that she has affected Andy's sex life, she begins to feel guilty. She holds a meeting where the office workers share {{advice on how to}} sexually perform. After the meeting, when Nellie makes another innuendo about Andy's problems, Erin loses her temper by yelling at Nellie to shut up, throwing her office phone to the ground, followed by Nellie's memo forms, pens, and her caramel. This gives Andy, filled with anger, the freedom to vent by throwing his <b>desk</b> <b>chair</b> at Robert, throwing Nellie's picture frame to the ground, and finally punching his hand through the wall (echoing his behavior in the third season episode [...] "The Return"). When Robert then chooses Nellie as regional manager, Andy refuses to accept a demotion by saying [...] "no" [...] too many times in a calm way, and a surprised Robert fires him. As a result, Andy regains his sense of self-confidence and is once again able to perform.|$|E
