40|$|Unmodified unplasticised PVC (PVC-U) has the {{disadvantage}} of being prone to occasional brittleness and is notch sensitive. To increase the impact resistance, a multiphase systems consisting of PVC with various additives such as impact modifiers and fillers were developed and are being used in windows frame formulations. There has been considerable effort and interest in the addition of calcium carbonate fillers to the impactmodified PVC-U formulations to modify properties and also to reduce cost. This paper reports the use of Instrumented Falling Weight Impact tester {{to determine the effect}} of calcium carbonate fillers on impact strength of <b>impact-modified</b> PVC-U. Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis had also been carried out to correlate the impact strength and the microstructure of the fracture surfaces. The results show that the impact strength of <b>impact-modified</b> PVC-U increases with decreasing calcium carbonate fillers particle size. ...|$|E
40|$|We present {{evidence}} to support the hypothesis that the fine-grained, basaltic-textured portions of rocks 60618 and 65785 were produced by impact melting of the coarse-grained spinel-olivine anorthosite (60618) and spinel troctolite (65785) portions, coupled with admixture of approximately 33 % and 63 %, respectively, material of alkalic high-alumina basalt (KREEP) composition. The abundance of <b>impact-modified</b> rocks at the Apollo 16 site with compositional similarities to the impact melts reported here, suggests that the relations observed in these rocks are indicative of widespread impact mixing with KREEP in rocks of the lunar highlands...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} <b>impact-modifying</b> an {{unsaturated}} polyester comprising units derived from polycondensation of maleic anhydride and di(2 -hydroxypropyl ether) of bisphenol-A (BPAF), the method comprising: a) adding to {{a solution of}} the polyester in a vinyl aromatic monomer, preferably styrene, a multi-stage impact modifier having no reactive functionality, and b) polymerizing the vinyl aromatic monomer to form a cross-linked network in which the impact modifier is present in separate small domains which act {{as a means for}} incorporating rubber and toughening the polyester. The multi-stage impact modifier preferably comprises a first-stage core of a crosslinked rubber containing predominantly at least one of a C 2 or C 8 alkyl ester of acrylic acid or butadiene, and a final shell which predominantly contains methyl methacrylate...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands (<b>impact-modified)</b> PVC is the {{preferred}} material for low-pressure (30 and 100 mbar) gas distribution systems. More than 50 % of the total length (about 122, 000 km) of this system is rigid PVC or <b>impact-modified</b> PVC. The installation of rigid PVC (uPVC) pipelines started about 50 years ago. Presently, about 22, 500 km of rigid PVC is still in operation. In this paper the good experiences with rigid PVC gas distribution systems in the Netherlands will be illustrated by results of regular leak surveys and test results on pipe samples taken from the gas grid. It will be shown that the leakage rate of uPVC pipe systems is very low and about {{equal to that of}} PE and steel pipe systems. Impact tests show no significant decrease in ductility with respect to time of use. Furthermore, the ductility of the PVC pipeline materials which have been in use for many years is shown to be mainly dependent on the (initial) quality (degree of gelation). The good performance of PVC gas pipeline systems is also proven by modelling studies. It will be shown that the long-term failure behaviour of uPVC is determined by the ability to yield. Failure will occur if a certain critical value of the plastic strain is surpassed. Using this model the long-term behaviour under internal pressure of rigid PVC pipes can be predicted quantitatively...|$|E
40|$|Measurements {{of complex}} {{relative}} permittivity over extended ranges of frequency and temperature {{have been obtained}} {{for a number of}} commercially important engineering thermoplastics. The study provides evidence for partial miscibility of the component polymers of <b>impact-modified</b> polycarbonate/polybutylene terephthalate and polycarbonate/polyethylene terephthalate blends and for a two-phase blend morphology with a polyester-rich dispersed phase in a continuous matrix rich in polycarbonate. A second representative conclusion concerns poly(acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) where dielectric spectroscopy yields separate absorptions which can be related to the miscibility and morphology of the individual phases. In this case two low-temperature absorptions are attributed respectively to rubber-rich and styrene-acrylonitrile-rich regions in the core and shell of the latex particles which constitute the dispersed phase...|$|E
40|$|In this study, <b>impact-modified</b> {{polypropylene}} (PP) ternary blends {{based on}} PP/natural rubber (NR) /linear low-density polyethylene (LLDFE) with ratios of 72 / 10 / 18 and 64 / 20 / 16 were {{produced by a}} twin-screw extruder with polyoctenamer (TOR) as the compatibilizer. The mechanical properties of the blend were determined on injection-molded specimens in tensile, flexural, and impact testing. The impact strength and elongation at break of the blend increased significantly while the flexural modulus and tensile strength decreased slightly with increasing TOR content. The impact strength improved with the increasing TOR due the increase of interfacial adhesion resulting in finer dispersion of the rubbery minor phase in the PP matrix. The improvement in compatibility {{with the addition of}} TOR into PP/NR/LLDPE blends is being supported by both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) ...|$|E
40|$|By curing of {{in water}} {{dispersed}} droplets of an aromatic or aliphatic epoxy resin, respectively, glassy or rubbery thermosetting epoxy spheres {{can be prepared}} in a relatively easy way. The rubbery epoxy particles can successfully be applied as a toughening agent for glassy epoxy matrices. The advantage of these preformed modifiers is the control over the final morphology as the size and concentration of the dispersed rubber phase can be chosen independently. The improvement in fracture toughness and the morphological features of the fracture surfaces are identical to standard, but also more complex, toughening routes, such as the application of liquid rubbers [Sultan JN, Laible RC, McGarry FJ. Appl. Polym. Symp. 1971; 16 : 127; Sultan JN, McGarry FJ. Polym. Eng. Sci. 1973; 13 : 29]. The use of this new class of rubber modifiers is not restricted to glassy epoxy resins, but may also be applied to produce <b>impact-modified</b> thermoplastics with a predetermined particle size and rubber content...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{successful}} methods developed for modifying polymer properties is the rubber-toughening process by blending rubbers with plastics. Blends of polypropylene (PP) with elastomers are developed with the objective to overcome the inherent brittleness of PP at low temperatures and to enhance the impact strength at room temperature. In this study, a new <b>impact-modified</b> PP ternary blends based on PP/ natural rubber (NR) /linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) is developed; the NR content ranged from 0 to 30 %. The blends were prepared in a laboratory scale twin screw extruder. After mixing and pelletising, the samples were injection moulded and tested for mechanical properties. Impact, flexural and morphological properties of the blends were studied. An increase in impact strength but a decrease of flexural modulus was observed with increasing NR contents. The partial replacement of PP with LLDPE as the third component in PP/NR/LLDPE ternary blend had enhanced the impact strength with a slight decreased in flexural modulus. From morphologv features, LLDPE addition improves the dispersion or NR, affecting mainly the larger particles...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of poly(vinyl chloride) {{can be modified}} through the incorporation of suitable additives such as fillers. calcium carbonate {{is the most popular}} type of filler for PVC because of their excellent combination of low cost, high brightness and the ability to be used at high loadings. fusion has a profound influence on mechanical, physical and chemical properties. Due to these factors, various method assesment of fusion have been developed. In this project, rabender Plasticorder mixing chamber was used to study the fusion behaviour of calcium carbonate filled impact modified PVC-U was conducted. The other objective is to determine the effect of surface modification on the fusion properties. The result showed that the fusion time for the 0. 8 micrometer particles size calcium carbonate filled <b>impact-modified</b> PVC-U had the shortest fusion time and highest torque. The fusion time increased with increasing calcium carbonate particle size. The coated calcium carbonate fillers increased the fusion time but decreased the melt viscosity compared to the uncoated calcium carbonate fillers. The use of the coupling agent increased the fusion time and increased the melt viscosity...|$|E
