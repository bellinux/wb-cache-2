Some schools are in the Catholic 'maintained' sector, i.e. maintained by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, and others are controlled directly by the state. Directly-controlled state schools generally have a predominantly Protestant intake.|$|E

5|$|The Sun is a Population I, or heavy-element-rich, star. The {{formation}} of the Sun may have been triggered by shockwaves <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more nearby supernovae. This is suggested by a high abundance of heavy elements in the Solar System, such as gold and uranium, relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called Population II, heavy-element-poor, stars. The heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by endothermic nuclear reactions during a supernova, or by transmutation through neutron absorption within a massive second-generation star.|$|E

5|$|Most {{bees are}} polylectic (generalist) meaning they collect pollen {{from a range}} of {{flowering}} plants, however, some are oligoleges (specialists), in that they only gather pollen <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> a few species or genera of closely related plants. Specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen, and male orchid bees, which gather aromatic compounds from orchids (one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators). Bees are able to sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers, floral odors, and even electromagnetic fields. Once landed, a bee then uses nectar quality and pollen taste to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers.|$|E

5|$|Often the Matrikas are {{confused}} with the Yoginis, a group of sixty-four or eighty-one Tantric goddesses. In Sanskrit literature the Yoginis have been represented as the attendants or various manifestations of goddess Durga engaged in fighting with the demons Shumbha and Nishumbha, and the principal Yoginis are identified with the Matrikas. Other Yoginis are described as born <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more Matrikas. The derivation of sixty-four Yoginis from eight Matrikas became a common tradition, by mid- 11th century. The Mandala (circle) and chakra of Yoginis were used alternatively. The eighty-one Yoginis evolve {{from a group of}} nine Matrikas, instead of seven or eight. The Saptamatrika (Brahmi, Maheshvari, Kumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda) joined by Chandika and Mahalakshmi form the nine Matrika cluster. Each Matrika {{is considered to be a}} Yogini and is associated with eight other Yoginis resulting in the troupe of eighty-one (nine times nine). Thus, Yoginis are considered as manifestations or daughters of the Matrikas.|$|E
5|$|The pre-Columbian Maya civilization {{developed}} and used an intricate and fully functional writing system, {{which is the}} only Mesoamerican script that can be said to be almost fully deciphered. Earlier-established civilizations to the west and north of the Maya homelands that also had scripts recorded in surviving inscriptions include the Zapotec, Olmec, and the Zoque-speaking peoples of the southern Veracruz and western Chiapas area—but their scripts are as yet largely undeciphered. It is generally agreed that the Maya writing system was adapted <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more of these earlier systems. A number of references identify the undeciphered Olmec script as its most likely precursor.|$|E
