In North America, many families call one set of <b>grandparents</b> by their ethnic names (e.g., Hispanic <b>grandparents</b> might be called abuelo and abuela or [...] "abuelito" [...] and [...] "abuelita", French <b>grandparents</b> might be called papi and mamie, Italian <b>grandparents</b> might be called nonno and nonna, or Dutch and German <b>grandparents</b> might be called Opa and Oma.

Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise and on 11 April a decree was promulgated that stated anyone who had even one Jewish parent or <b>grandparent</b> was considered non-Aryan.

It is of increasing social and economic significance yet many dimensions of <b>grandparenting</b> are still poorly understood. Contemporary <b>Grandparenting</b> is the first book to take a sociological approach to <b>grandparenting</b> across diverse country contexts and combines new theorising with up-to-date empirical findings to document the changing nature of <b>grandparenting</b> across global contexts. In this highly original book, leading contributors analyse how <b>grandparenting</b> differs according to the nature of the welfare state and the cultural context, how family breakdown influences <b>grandparenting,</b> and explore men's changing roles as grandfathers. <b>Grandparents</b> today face conflicting norms and expectations about their roles, but act with agency to forge new identities within the context of societal and cultural constraints.

5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected <b>grandparent.</b> In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: As our {{knowledge}} about the experiences of <b>grandparents</b> when their grandchild has a disability is extremely limited, {{the purpose of this}} research was to explore the emotional journey of Australian <b>grandparents.</b> Method: This qualitative research utilised purposive sampling and semi-structured in-depth interviews to explore the experiences of 22 Australian <b>grandparents,</b> whose grandchild had been diagnosed with a disability. Results: Three key themes characterised <b>grandparent’s</b> emotional journey: Adjusting (the transition from anger to acceptance), The ‘Double Grief’ (sadness about what might have been for both their child and grandchild) and Pride in Family (pride in family’s ability to adjust to the challenges of the situation). Conclusion: As the first Australian study to explore the experiences of <b>grandparents</b> when their grandchild has a disability, the research provides important new {{knowledge about the}} emotional journey for <b>grandparents.</b> Unlike overseas research, Australian <b>grandparents</b> view themselves as being there to support their own children, rather than ‘holding the family together’. The findings will inform current policy debates about the role of <b>grandparents</b> and highlight the importance of support services that help facilitate <b>grandparent’s</b> role within their family...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Grandparents</b> {{are very}} {{important}} in several ways {{for their children and}} grandchildren during a divorce process. In addition <b>grandparents</b> experience various consequences {{as a result of the}} divorce. This study examines different problems (organizational, emotional, behavioural and financial) <b>grandparents</b> meet around the divorce of their children. Furthermore the changes, before and after the divorce, in quantitative (frequency) and qualitative (support) contact with their grandchildren will be examined. The role gender differences and the difference between maternal and paternal <b>grandparents</b> play regarding quantitative contact will also be explored. Besides, the differences in quantitative and qualitative contact considering the residential address of the grandchild will be examined. Method: This study is partly exploring and partly testing. Participants in this population-based sample were <b>grandparents</b> from different regions in the Netherlands whose children were divorced. The sample comprised 100 participants (42 grandfathers, 58 grandmothers - 46 paternal <b>grandparents</b> and 54 maternal <b>grandparents).</b> Existing instruments as well as self-composed instruments were used. Results: <b>Grandparents</b> seemed to have significantly more emotional, organizational and financial problems after the divorce of their children compared to the period before the divorce. The hypothesis that <b>grandparents</b> would have more behavioural problems after the divorce was falsified by the results; <b>grandparents</b> had significantly less behavioural problems after the divorce of their children compared to before the divorce. Grandparents’ frequency in contact with their grandchildren did not diminish after the divorce. But the frequency in contact of grandchildren with their paternal <b>grandparents</b> declined significantly after the divorce. Furthermore, <b>grandparents</b> supported their grandchildren and children significantly more after the divorce than before. Conclusion: <b>Grandparents</b> suffer after the divorce of their children. It affects their emotional health, requires financial contributions and leads to organizational adjustments and sacrifices. These findings underline the oddity of not drawing <b>grandparents</b> into psychological healthcare...|$|R

Those <b>grandparents</b> raising grandchildren demonstrating neurological, physical, emotional, or behavioral problems exhibited the most distress, the most disruption of roles, and the most deteriorated grandparent-grandchild relationships. Although the custodial <b>grandparents</b> raising apparently normal grandchildren demonstrated less distress, less disruption of roles, and less deterioration of the grandparent-grandchild relationship than those <b>grandparents</b> raising grandchildren displaying problems, they still demonstrated higher levels than did traditional <b>grandparents.</b> Those <b>grandparents</b> who reported fewer resources, demonstrated poor attitudes regarding seeking mental health services, and reported raising grandchildren displaying problems had the lowest levels of adjustment...|$|R

In addition, a comparison was made between first-time parenting and second-time parenting and the parenting style experienced by these <b>grandparents</b> as children in their family of origin. The <b>Grandparents</b> Parenting Grandchildren Questionnaire (GPGQ) was distributed to 505 <b>grandparents</b> raising grandchildren between birth and 12 years old in HARP <b>Grandparenting</b> Support Groups in six states. One hundred fortyfour responses were analyzed at the. 05 level of significance measuring the multivariate difference between four parenting styles (authoritarian, permissive, rejecting/neglecting, and authoritative). Ten <b>grandparents</b> were interviewed by telephone. Results 1. The multivariate difference between the parenting style used by <b>grandparents</b> in the first-time parenting of their own children with second-time parenting of grandchildren was significant. In parenting their own children, <b>grandparents</b> were more authoritarian, more rejective, and less authoritative than they were in parenting their grandchildren. 2. The multivariate difference between the parenting style used by <b>grandparents</b> in the first-time parenting as compared with their memories of the parenting style used in their family of origin was significant. In parenting their own children <b>grandparents</b> were found to be less authoritarian, more permissive, less rejective, and more authoritative than their parents were. 3. The multivariate difference between the parenting style used by the <b>grandparents</b> in the second-time parenting of their grandchildren and the parenting style experienced as children in their family of origin was significant. When parenting their grandchildren <b>grandparents</b> were found to be less authoritarian, more permissive, less rejective and more authoritative than their parents were. 4. <b>Grandparents</b> reported raising their grandchildren differently from their children (54. 1 %), the same (33. 3 %), and 12. 5 % did not answer the question. 5. <b>Grandparents</b> from telephone interviews reported some differences in second-time parenting from the first-time parenting due to available resources, legal arrangements, family issues, understanding of discipline, and the role differences.
