We model {{magnetic}} fields around rope genetated by magnetized part <b>of</b> <b>rope.</b> The work {{is based on the}} finite element program ANSYS. For the purposes of the experiments we consider one strand wire rope construction. We define different kinds <b>of</b> <b>defects</b> and faults. The shape of the magnetic induction lines of generated fields depends on the size <b>of</b> the <b>defect,</b> the depth <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> violation and the presence <b>of</b> other nearby <b>defects.</b> The location and number of disturbances have been chosen to achieve the most versatile outputs. All of these modifications were analyzed and the results displayed in the 3 D colored graphs...|$|R

An analysis of the uncertainty contributions that affect the defect position measurements is described in this paper and an improved measurement system is also presented. The system {{is designed to be}} employed with commercial instruments for electromagnetic tests and it is composed of a laser-based detector, a digital acquisition system and a personal computer. A specially designed algorithm locates a reference point in the rope and measures the distance between the defects and the reference.

40|$|As the key bearing {{components}} in engineering projects, wire ropes often suffer from high-speed impact loads in service. In the majority <b>of</b> applications, wire <b>ropes</b> {{are subjected to}} the loads with the following characteristics: alternating impact loads, short-time overload, and small movements among adjacent spiral strands. Typical failure modes <b>of</b> wire <b>ropes</b> include fracture, wear, corrosion, geometric failure and thermal failure. In this work, the corresponding failure mechanisms were analyzed. For a certain type <b>of</b> wire <b>ropes,</b> the fracture morphology, surface quality, microstructure and internal <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> steel wires were analyzed, and failure causes were discussed. Accordingly, the precautions {{in relation to the}} safe use <b>of</b> wire <b>ropes</b> were proposed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Early defect {{detection}} and monitoring <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> systems constitute important safety requirements for equipment that employs ropes as single driving component, e. g. lifts, rope trains, etc. Quality characteristics <b>of</b> <b>ropes</b> are regulated by procedures of safety standards and are prescribed in safety standards of transportation machines, which are particularly stringent {{in the case}} of human elevating equipment. Many types <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> quality control are applied in practice but standard control procedure of such nonhomogeneous structures as ropes with electromagnetic methods are still not fully reliable, particularly {{in the case of}} broken wires in rope strands. The paper presents a method for detection <b>of</b> the aforementioned <b>rope</b> <b>defects</b> using dynamic properties <b>of</b> a <b>rope</b> that is treated as a dynamic system. The proposed method enables to measure dynamic characteristics <b>of</b> a <b>rope</b> system and, based on obtained results, evaluate rope quality, determine the presence of broken strands and define cross-section <b>of</b> the <b>defects.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> dynamic properties is used in order to establish existence <b>of</b> a <b>defect.</b> Aim <b>of</b> such analysis is to determine some characteristic natural frequencies corresponding to broken strand and change of the lowest natural frequencies that represent the rope as a constrained system. The paper also addresses the issues of equipment and methodology required for defect detection in ropes together with the necessary conditions. Final conclusions are formulated with regard to possibility of implementing the proposed method in real working conditions...|$|R

In spite of mushrooming design improvement the malfunctioning of brakes is reported repeatedly, caused by handling mistakes or un-optimised design. This review article provides a detailed discussion of the evolution and the design <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes and introduces a new design classification. Design varieties are examined and addressed in detail. Subsequently, the mechanics <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes are reviewed and the differences between dynamic and static belaying are compared as to static and kinetic friction as well as belt and linear friction. In this critical review of modelling and testing <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes, we discuss misconceptions as well as improvements. The issues covered in this review article aim to highlight the problems and challenges which the design <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes and belay devices is facing in the quest for developing an optimised brake which never fails and which is ready to use without training. The shortcomings of modelling and testing <b>of</b> <b>rope</b> brakes are mainly due to neglecting kinetic friction, which disadvantageously affects design optimisation but also opens design opportunities...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we present a unified way to smooth certain {{multiple}} structures called ropes on smooth varieties. We prove that most <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> arbitrary multiplicity, supported on smooth curves can be smoothed. By a rope being smoothable we mean that the rope is the flat limit {{of a family of}} smooth, irreducible curves. To construct a smoothing, we connect, on the one hand, deformations of a finite morphism to projective space and, on the other hand, morphisms from a rope to projective space. We also prove a general result of independent interest, namely, finite covers onto smooth irreducible curves embedded in projective space can be deformed to a family of 1 : 1 maps. We apply our general theory to prove the smoothing <b>of</b> <b>ropes</b> <b>of</b> 3 on P^ 1.
