5|$|Atmospheric {{twinkling}} {{limits the}} resolution obtainable from <b>ground-based</b> telescopes since turbulence degrades angular resolution.|$|E
5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized <b>ground-based</b> {{techniques such}} as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of <b>ground-based</b> telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution <b>ground-based</b> imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, <b>ground-based</b> {{observations}} {{determined that}} Mathilde is a C-type asteroid. It {{was also found}} to have an unusually long period of rotation of 418 hours.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the Dawn spacecraft, some Vestan surface {{features}} had already been resolved using the Hubble Space Telescope and <b>ground-based</b> telescopes (e.g. the Keck Observatory).|$|E
5|$|Surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a special}} type of weather map that provides a view of weather elements over a geographical area at a specified time based on information from <b>ground-based</b> weather stations.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{distance}} of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, {{the smallest of the}} Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large <b>ground-based</b> telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s the LFR {{network of}} <b>ground-based</b> radio transmitters, coupled with {{on-board}} AM radio receivers, became {{a vital part}} of instrument flying. LFR provided navigational guidance to aircraft for en route operations and approaches, under virtually all weather conditions, helping to make consistent and reliable flight schedules a reality.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated {{by a large}} number of <b>ground-based</b> and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably BOOMERanG, found the shape of the universe to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.|$|E
5|$|International {{airports}} {{have extensive}} operations in managing flight logistics, such as air traffic control. The latter service {{is provided by}} <b>ground-based</b> controllers who coordinate and direct aircraft {{on the ground and}} through controlled airspace. Air traffic control also provides advisory services to aircraft in non-controlled airspace.|$|E
5|$|Spacecraft and space-based modules that do {{particle}} detection, {{looking for}} cosmic rays and electrons. These can be emitted {{by the sun}} (Solar Energetic Particles), our galaxy (Galactic cosmic rays) and extragalactic sources (Extragalactic cosmic rays). There are also Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from active galactic nuclei, those can be detected by <b>ground-based</b> detectors via their particle showers.|$|E
5|$|The first scientifically useful {{observation}} of Neptune from <b>ground-based</b> telescopes using adaptive optics, was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii. Neptune is currently entering its {{spring and summer}} season and {{has been shown to}} be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, <b>ground-based</b> telescopes with adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of it. Both Hubble and the adaptive-optics telescopes on Earth have made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet, among others. In 2004 and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were discovered.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of Diddy Kong Racing, another team {{was working on a}} new game known as Dinosaur Planet for the Nintendo 64. However, Shigeru Miyamoto, a Nintendo executive, demanded the team to recreate the game as a Star Fox title for Nintendo's new console, the GameCube. Unlike previous Star Fox games, Star Fox Adventures focused on <b>ground-based</b> open world exploration. The game received positive reviews upon its launch in 2002. Star Fox Adventures was the only game developed by Rare for GameCube.|$|E
5|$|As the {{atmosphere}} is transparent for radio waves, radio telescopes in space are of most use for Very Long Baseline Interferometry; doing simultaneous observations of a source with both a satellite and a <b>ground-based</b> telescope and by correlating their signals to simulate a radio telescope {{the size of the}} separation between the two telescopes. Observations can be of supernova remnants, masers, gravitational lenses, starburst galaxies, and many other things.|$|E
5|$|As work on {{the project}} has progressed, {{information}} has been published {{on a number of}} design versions, including A4, C1, C2, and D1. Testing of the key technologies was successfully completed in November 2012, allowing Skylon's design to advance from its research phase to a development phase. An engine test facility is being built at Westcott and if all goes to plan, the first <b>ground-based</b> engine tests could happen in 2020, and Skylon could be performing unmanned test flights by 2025.|$|E
5|$|By 1961, {{when all}} {{airframe}} maintenance at Laverton {{was transferred to}} Nos.2 and 3 Aircraft Depots, No.1 AD had serviced forty-two aircraft types throughout its existence. It continued to maintain aero engines, and began supporting telecommunications equipment as well. The aircraft engine repair facilities at No.1 AD were closed down in 1968. Staff were transferred to No.3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, {{to prepare for the}} introduction of the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber to Australian service and concentrate on maintaining the new aircraft's engines. No.1 AD's focus thereafter shifted to ground support, manufacturing, installing, servicing and providing training for navigational, air traffic control, telecommunications and motor transport equipment used by the Air Force and other sections of Defence and government. From 1968 to 1977, the depot was organised into two components, Telecommunications Installation and Maintenance Squadron and Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron. These were subdivided in February 1977 into Telecommunications Squadron (maintaining ground communications equipment for control towers, transmitters and receiving stations in Australia and the region), Radar Squadron (supporting surveillance systems at RAAF Bases Williamtown, Amberley, Townsville, Darwin and Pearce), Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron (maintaining motor transport, and other <b>ground-based</b> mechanical and electro-mechanical systems), and Intermediate Level Maintenance Squadron (communications, navigation and other <b>ground-based</b> maintenance at Laverton, as well as spectrometric analysis of oil used by the RAAF in aircraft and other equipment).|$|E
5|$|Having {{discovered}} the planet, the astronomers worked {{to discover a}} transit event using the Infrared Array Camera of the Spitzer Space Telescope, as <b>ground-based</b> observations could prove difficult if Gliese 3634 b was a rocky planet. While the observations did not suggest that Gliese 3634 b transited its star, a few orbital parameters were discovered, yielding the planet's true mass, which cannot be collected solely by radial velocity measurements.|$|E
5|$|Ida is {{classified}} as an S-type asteroid based on <b>ground-based</b> spectroscopic measurements. The composition of S-types was uncertain before the Galileo flybys, but was interpreted to be either of two minerals found in meteorites that had fallen to the Earth: ordinary chondrite (OC) and stony-iron. Estimates of Ida's density are constrained to less than 3.2g/cm3 by the long-term stability of Dactyl's orbit. This all but rules out a stony-iron composition; were Ida made of 5g/cm3 iron- and nickel-rich material, {{it would have to}} contain more than 40% empty space.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the Smithsonian Institution {{commissioned}} {{aeronautical engineer}} Paul MacCready {{to build a}} half-scale working model of Quetzalcoatlus northropi. The replica was launched with a <b>ground-based</b> winch. It flew several times in 1986 and was filmed {{as part of the}} Smithsonian's IMAX film On the Wing. However, the model was not anatomically correct and embodied vertical and horizontal tail stabilizers that pterosaurs did not have. It also had a longer tail, changing the weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, Saville {{served on}} the Guided Missiles Interdepartmental Operational Requirements Group (GMIORG), a {{military}} and civilian committee tasked with the coordination of research on guided missiles, {{as well as the}} development of tactics and overall strategy. In his role as USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Saville helped direct missile work, but soon replaced himself on the GMIORG with Major General Robert M. Lee, commander of TAC. Saville was more interested in air-to-air guided missiles than in <b>ground-based</b> ballistic missiles, which became the focus of the committee.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} after Otto Jesse's death in 1901, {{there were few}} new {{insights}} into the nature of noctilucent clouds. Wegener's conjecture, that they were composed of water ice, was later shown to be correct. Study was limited to <b>ground-based</b> observations and scientists had very little knowledge of the mesosphere until the 1960s, when direct rocket measurements began. These showed {{for the first time that}} the occurrence of the clouds coincided with very low temperatures in the mesosphere.|$|E
5|$|Kid Icarus: Uprising {{takes place}} in a setting based loosely around Greek mythology. The main protagonist is the angel Pit, servant of the Goddess of Light Palutena. When the Goddess of Darkness Medusa returns to destroy humanity, Pit goes on {{missions}} first against her, then against the forces of Hades, Lord of the Underworld and the source behind Medusa's return. During gameplay, players control Pit during airborne rail shooter segments and <b>ground-based</b> third-person shooter segments. In addition to the single-player campaign, multiple multiplayer modes are available, with competitive modes available for up to six players.|$|E
5|$|Lock was {{the first}} of three {{successful}} RAF aces who were shot down during this period: Douglas Bader was shot down in error and taken prisoner on 9 August 1941; Robert Stanford Tuck's Spitfire was hit by enemy <b>ground-based</b> flak near Boulogne-sur-Mer on 28 January 1942 and he was forced to crash land and taken prisoner. In July 1942, Paddy Finucane would be lost in similar circumstances to Lock.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} aims of {{the astronomers}} who {{designed}} the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high optical resolution to study distant galaxies {{to a level of}} detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the atmosphere, Hubble avoids atmospheric airglow allowing it to take more sensitive visible and ultraviolet light images than can be obtained with seeing-limited <b>ground-based</b> telescopes (when good adaptive optics correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10m <b>ground-based</b> telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from spherical aberration when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because light takes billions of years to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows {{a better understanding of how}} they evolve.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after World WarII, No.1 AD {{introduced}} the first jets into RAAF service. In 1961, it ceased airframe maintenance, {{but continued to}} service aero engines. By the 1970s, the depot's main focus was <b>ground-based</b> equipment, though it still handled some aircraft components. No.1 AD was disbanded in December 1994, its functions having {{been taken over by}} other units and private contractors. At the time of its disbandment, it was the oldest RAAF unit in continuous operation.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1960s, robotic {{spacecraft}} {{have been}} sent to explore Mars from orbit and the surface in extensive detail. In addition, remote sensing of Mars from Earth by <b>ground-based</b> and orbiting telescopes has continued across much of the electromagnetic spectrum. These include infrared observations to determine the composition of the surface, ultraviolet and submillimeter observation of the atmospheric composition, and radio measurements of wind velocities.|$|E
5|$|The Drakengard games {{feature a}} mix of action-based hack-and-slash combat during <b>ground-based</b> battles and aerial combat mixed in with RPG {{leveling}} mechanics. In the original, the player guides the characters around <b>ground-based</b> battles to combat small groups of enemy units. In aerial combat, the player takes control of the protagonist's dragon partner. In these situations, the dragon can either lock onto a target and unleash a barrage of small fireballs, or the player can manually aim and fire large bursts of flame, which do more damage but do not home in on a target. Basic gameplay changed little for Drakengard 2, {{but there are some}} differences and additions, such as weapon types being tied to the character they are associated with, with changing them also swapping the character. The dragon gameplay remained virtually unchanged, apart from the ability, during air-ground missions, for the dragon to swoop down on a group of enemies in a special attack depicted in a short cutscene.|$|E
5|$|The anti-infiltration {{effort would}} be {{supported}} by MSQ-77 Combat Skyspot, a <b>ground-based</b> radar bombing system first introduced in Southeast Asia in 1966 to direct B-52 strikes in poor weather or in complete darkness. This system was utilized to direct one-quarter of all strike missions conducted by U.S. aircraft during the conflict. Combat Skyspot was complemented by expanding the radio-based LORAN system utilized by other strike aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The arcs {{are quite}} stable structures. They were {{detected}} by <b>ground-based</b> stellar occultations in the 1980s, by Voyager 2 in 1989 and by Hubble Space Telescope and <b>ground-based</b> telescopes in 1997–2005 and remained at {{approximately the same}} orbital longitudes. However some changes have been noticed. The overall brightness of arcs decreased since 1986. The Courage arc jumped forward by 8° to 294° (it probably jumped over to the next stable co-rotation resonance position) while the Liberté arc had almost disappeared by 2003. The Fraternité and Égalité (1 and 2) arcs have demonstrated irregular variations in their relative brightness. Their observed dynamics is probably related to the exchange of dust between them. Courage, a very faint arc found during the Voyager flyby, was seen to flare in brightness in 1998; {{it was back to}} its usual dimness by June 2005. Visible light observations show that the total amount of material in the arcs has remained approximately constant, but they are dimmer in the infrared light wavelengths where previous observations were taken.|$|E
5|$|The disks of most {{stars are}} much too small in angular size to be {{observed}} with current <b>ground-based</b> optical telescopes, and so interferometer telescopes are required to produce images of these objects. Another technique for measuring the angular size of stars is through occultation. By precisely measuring the drop in brightness of a star as it is occulted by the Moon (or the rise in brightness when it reappears), the star's angular diameter can be computed.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} published {{discovery of}} a moon other than the Earth's was by Galileo Galilei, who discovered the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610. Over the following three centuries only a few more moons were discovered. Missions to other planets in the 1970s, most notably the Voyager 1 and 2 missions, saw a surge {{in the number of}} moons detected, and observations since the year 2000, using mostly large, <b>ground-based</b> optical telescopes, have discovered many more, all of which are irregular.|$|E
5|$|The planet Jupiter has {{a system}} of rings known as the rings of Jupiter or the Jovian ring system. It was the third ring system to be {{discovered}} in the Solar System, after those of Saturn and Uranus. It was first observed in 1979 by the Voyager 1 space probe and thoroughly investigated in the 1990s by the Galileo orbiter. It has also been observed by the Hubble Space Telescope and from Earth for the past 23 years. <b>Ground-based</b> observations of the rings require the largest available telescopes.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} {{considered}} highly popular in Japan, having sold well and gained a cult following, though {{it appears to}} be a niche series in Western territories. The main games have become noted for their dark storylines and mixture of <b>ground-based</b> and aerial combat, while Nier stood out because of its mixture of gameplay styles. The series has received mixed to positive reception in both Japan and the West: the majority of praise has been given to its story and characters, while the gameplay has come in for criticisms for being repetitive or poorly designed.|$|E
5|$|The {{sizes of}} both moons are {{calculated}} {{with the assumption}} that they have the same infrared albedo as Haumea, which is reasonable as their spectra show them to have the same surface composition. Haumea's albedo has been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope: from <b>ground-based</b> telescopes, the moons are too small and close to Haumea to be seen independently. Based on this common albedo, the inner moon, Namaka, which is a tenth the mass of Hiʻiaka, would be about 170km in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The system, {{then known}} as RDF 1.5, would require {{a large number of}} <b>ground-based</b> {{transmitters}} to work in an operational setting. Moreover, good reception was only achieved when the target, interceptor, and transmitter were roughly in a line. Due to these limitations, the basic concept was considered unworkable as an operational system, and all effort moved to designs with both the transmitter and receiver in the interceptor aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Uranus was {{the last}} giant planet without any known {{irregular}} moons, but since 1997 nine distant irregular moons have been identified using <b>ground-based</b> telescopes. Two more small inner moons, Cupid and Mab, were discovered using the Hubble Space Telescope in 2003. As of 2016, the moon Margaret {{was the last}} Uranian moon discovered, and its characteristics were published in October 2003.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{not only}} affects {{in-flight}} operations but can affect <b>ground-based</b> airport operations as well. Small accumulations of ash can reduce visibility, create slippery runways and taxiways, infiltrate communication and electrical systems, interrupt ground services, damage buildings and parked aircraft. Ash accumulation {{of more than}} a few millimeters requires removal before airports can resume full operations. Ash does not disappear (unlike snowfalls) and must be disposed of in a manner that prevents it from being remobilised by wind and aircraft.|$|E
