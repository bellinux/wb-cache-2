50|$|Many {{compounds}} {{have been}} used for <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> but only a few are still in widespread use. Desflurane, isoflurane and sevoflurane are the most widely used volatile anaesthetics today. They are often combined with nitrous oxide. Older, less popular, volatile anaesthetics, include halothane, enflurane, and methoxyflurane. Researchers are also actively exploring the use of xenon as an anaesthetic.|$|E
50|$|He {{was a close}} {{personal}} friend, and professional colleague, of John Snow. On Snow's sudden death {{he took over the}} final editing of Snow's draft On Chloroform and Other Anaesthetics and supervised its publication in 1858. Ward Richardson remained a committed exponent of Snow's radical views on the microbial cause of infectious disease {{for the rest of his}} life. He continued, and extended, Snow's work on <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> and brought into clinical use, no less than fourteen anaesthetics, of which methylene bichloride is the best known, and he invented the first double-valved mouthpiece for use in the administration of chloroform. He also made known the peculiar properties of amyl nitrite, a drug which was largely used in the treatment of angina pectoris, and he introduced the bromides of quinine, iron and strychnia, ozonized ether, styptic and iodized colloid, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium ethoxide, substances which were soon largely used by the medical profession. In 1893, he was knighted in recognition of his eminent services to humanitarian causes.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{anesthesia}} procedure may {{effects to}} all {{system of the}} body, including cardiovascular. Enflurane inhalation is one of common used drugs in general anesthesia with high-flow even very high-flow semiclosed system technique. The objective {{of this study was}} proving that medium-flow semiclosed system technique can be use safely without decreasing the quality of anesthesia. Methods: This was an observational analytic study using cross sectional design, with 44 samples of medical records of patients experiencing elective surgery with general anesthesia at Kariadi Hospital Semarang. The sample fullfilled inclussion criterias; 16 - 40 years old, Body Mass Index (BMI) 20 - 25 kg/m 2, status of physical of American Society Of Anesthesiologist (ASA) I-II, surgery duration 1 - 3 hours.

40|$|During the <b>inhalation</b> of <b>anaesthesia</b> use of low fresh {{gas flow}} (0. 35 - 1 L/min) has some {{important}} advantages. There are three areas of benefit: pulmonary - anaesthesia with low fresh gas flow improves {{the dynamics of}} inhaled anaesthesia gas, increases mucociliary clearance, maintains body temperature and reduces water loss. Economic - reduction of anaesthesia gas consumption resulting in significant savings of > 75 % and Ecological - reduction in nitrous oxide consumption, which is an important ozone-depleting and heat-trapping greenhouse gas that is emitted. Nevertheless, anaesthesia with high fresh gas flows of 2 - 6 L/min is still performed, a technique in which rebreathing is practically negligible. This special article describes the clinical use of conventional plenum vaporizers, connected to the fresh gas supply to easily perform low (1 L/min), minimal (0. 5 L/min) or metabolic flow anaesthesia (0. 35 L/min) with conventional Primus Draeger® anaesthesia machines in routine clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{incidence}} and dangers of inhalation of gastric contents are con-sidered not only as an accompaniment of general anaesthesia {{but also as a}} complica-tion in comatose and debilitated states. The values of some of the methods which may be used for the prevention of such <b>inhalation</b> during <b>anaesthesia</b> are discussed. The immediate and late effects of aspiration on the patient are described. Special reference is made to Mendelson's syndrome. A method of treatment of inhalation is given and the value of the use of bronchial lavage and hydrocortisone is noted. Regurgitation and vomiting with subsequent inha-lation of gastric contents into the bronchial tree is a not uncommon occurrence and remains an important factor in the morbidity and mortality of anaesthesia. Hall (1940) reported the death of a normal, healthy primigravida which occurred as a result of aspiration of vomit during anaesthesia for a low forceps delivery. Many reports of simila...|$|R
40|$|Background. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{postoperative}} patient well‐being after total i. v. anaesthesia compared with <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> by means of validated psychometric tests. Methods. With ethics committee approval, 305 patients undergoing minor elective gynaecologic or orthopaedic interventions were assigned randomly to total i. v. anaesthesia using propofol or <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> using sevoflurane. The primary outcome measurement was the actual mental state 90 min and 24 h after anaesthesia assessed by a blinded observer using the Adjective Mood Scale (AMS) and the State‐Trait‐Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and postoperative pain level were determined by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 90 min and 24 h after anaesthesia (secondary outcome measurements). Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a VAS 24 h after anaesthesia. Results. The AMS and STAI scores were significantly better 90 min after total i. v. anaesthesia compared with <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> (P= 0. 02, P= 0. 05, respectively), but equal 24 h after both anaesthetic techniques (P= 0. 90, P= 0. 78, respectively); patient satisfaction was comparable (P= 0. 26). Postoperative pain was comparable in both groups 90 min and 24 h after anaesthesia (P= 0. 11, P= 0. 12, respectively). The incidence of postoperative nausea was reduced after total i. v. compared with <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> at 90 min (7 vs 35 %, P< 0. 001), and 24 h (33 vs 52 %, P= 0. 001). Conclusion. Total i. v. anaesthesia improves early postoperative patient well‐being and reduces the incidence of PONV. Br J Anaesth 2003; 91 : 631 -...|$|E
40|$|General {{anaesthesia}} may be {{the cause}} of different damages of the nervous system after surgery. Anaesthesia technique may be preventive factor of developing or worsening postoperative cognitive disfunctions. A research aim was to study an influence of <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> during the caesarean section on the parturients’ cognitive functions. Having agreed with local ethics committee and obtained informed consent, 30 pregnants (at 37 - 42 weeks of gestation (38, 9 (0, 76), those who underwent caesarian section) were examined. Inhalation anaesthesia: induction - thiopental sodium (5 mgs/kg), maintenance - sevofluran 1, 3 vol. %, in fresh gas flow 1, 5 L/min. Relaxation – suxcinilcholinum (1 - 1, 5 mgs/ kg). Phentanyl (0, 05 mgs/of ml - 4 mls) and diazepamum (10 mgs) after newborn extraction were introduced. Mainte­nance of analgesia is phentanyl in the dose of 0, 05 mg/ml – 1 ml in approaching of BIS to 60 (BISX Module, BIS™ Co­vidient, the USA). We used Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test – for cognitive functions investigation, “Matching digits and letters” test for control functions, Luria’s test for memory, perception was studied by test “recognition of time”. Speech was studied by test "name of fingers", praxis by “drawing of clock” test. Control points: 1 - upon admission to the obstetrical department (P 1), 24 hours after the surgery (P 2), on the day 3 after the surgery (P 3), on the day 5 - 7 after the surgery (P 4). The study showed that in 24 hours after caesarean section under <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> the meanings of cognitive functions did not change in general, and were kept on predelivery values. Under <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> cognitive functions are normalized on day 3 of postoperative period. Perception level does not depend on the time after surgery. Initially decreased memory level in expectant mothers was regressed after operative delivery and recovers by the day 3 after surgery.

40|$|In German organic agriculture, general {{anaesthesia}} of male piglets before castration is commonly performed by injection of ketamine and azaperone, plus {{application of the}} analgesic meloxicam. <b>Inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> with isoflurane (plus meloxicam) is an alternative with a shorter recovery phase and widely used in Switzerland, but requires reclassification for pigs on a case to case basis in Germany. In order to provide data on piglets´ behavior after castration and potential long-term effects on growth until weaning, a trial under practical conditions on an experimental farm was conducted. Body weight development until weaning was not affected by the method of anaesthesia. However, piglets anaesthetised with injection showed significantly more motoric anomalies and {{were in danger of}} being crushed more frequently during the first eight hours after castration. We conclude that piglets recover faster after <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> therefore the approval and use of isoflurane can be recommended...|$|E

40|$|The usual {{method of}} <b>inhalation</b> {{induction}} of <b>anaesthesia</b> is to administer a low concentration of an anaesthetic vapour, commonly in a carrier gas containing nitrous oxide, and increase this con-centration progressively, until {{a relatively high}} concentration is tolerated by the patient without coughing; subsequently, the inhaled concen-tration is adjusted to maintain stable anaesthesia. Ruffle and colleagues [1] described a technique of rapid inhalation induction that they used in approximately 200 patients. A vital capacity of 4 % halothane was inhaled, and held in the lungs for 3 O- 90 s, followed by tidal breathing until consciousness was lost.

40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{cannulation}} of the bovine oviducts permitting the collec-tion of daily samples of secretions would enhance {{the study of}} fertility as well as contribute to knowledge {{in the field of}} embryo nutrition and development. Olds & VanDemark (1957) used a wringer technique to obtain oviduct sec-retions from slaughterhouse material. Carlson, Black & Howe (1970) described a procedure for the continuous collection of oviduct fluid from the cow. Cannulation of the oviduct was accomplished with a single silastic cannula held in the oviduct by two collars sutured to the ovarian end of the oviduct. Numerous oviducal fluid collection systems have been used with varying degrees of success. Hamner & Fox (1969) reviewed collection techniques used in several species including the sheep, pig, monkey and rabbit. Yoshinaga, Mahoney & Pincus (1971) reported continuous collection from both oviducts. The animals used in this study were nulliparous dairy heifers (10 to 20 months of age) which were observed in oestrus at least once before surgery.

40|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} allows precise {{delivery of}} inhaled anaesthetic agents. Intubation in small non-human primates (less than 1 kg), is straightforward, using commercially available equipment, and careful {{positioning of the}} animal. Equipment and methods are fully described and illustrated. Keywords Anaesthesia; endotracheal intubation; primatesj Callitrichidaej Platyrrhini Compared to many methods of injectable anaesthesia, <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> is often more controllable, and induction and recov-ery are usually more rapid. The use of <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> has been reviewed in non-primates (Hughes & Lang 1972). The method of choice for delivery of inhalational anaesthetics to animals is via an endotracheal tube. This ensures a patent airway, delivers the agent(s) at the required concentration directly in the respiratory tract, and allows direct ventilation. Endotra-cheal intubation has been described in larger non-human primates (Martin et al. 1972). However, as in the smaller non-primate species used as laboratory animals (Wixson 1994), the perceived difficulty of the techni-que and lack of commerically available equipment has discouraged the use of endo-tracheal intubation. Based on studies in marmosets (Acker et al. 1994) we have further developed equip-ment and techniques for endotracheal intu...|$|E
40|$|Background the {{technique}} called one-lung ventilation can confine bleeding or infection to one lung, prevent rupture of a lung cyst or, more commonly, facilitate surgical {{exposure of the}} unventilated lung. During one- lung ventilation, anaesthesia is maintained either by delivering a volatile anaesthetic to the ventilated lung or by infusing an intravenous anaesthetic. It {{is possible that the}} method chosen to maintain anaesthesia may affect patient outcomes. Objectives the objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intravenous versus <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> for one- lung ventilation. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3), MEDLINE, LILACS, EMBASE (from inception to June 2006), ISI web of Science (1945 to June 2006), reference lists of identified trials, and bibliographies of published reviews. We also contacted researchers in the field. There were no language restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials and quasi- randomized controlled trials of intravenous versus <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> for one-lung ventilation. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results We included nine studies that enrolled 291 participants. We could not perform meta-analyses as the included studies did not report the outcomes listed in the protocol for this review. Authors' conclusions There is no evidence from randomized controlled trials of differences in patient outcomes for anaesthesia maintained by intravenous versus inhalational anaesthesia during one- lung ventilation. This review highlights the need for continued research into the use of intravenous versus <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> for one- lung ventilation. Future trials should have standardized outcome measures such as death, adverse postoperative outcomes and intraoperative awareness. Dropouts and losses to follow up should be reported.

As the endocrine stress response to surgery may be modulated by anaesthesia, we have altered stress hormone con-centrations by using either opioid or <b>inhalation</b> based <b>anaesthesia</b> to study haemostatic mech-anisms in cardiac surgical patients. Thirty patients undergoing coronary artery surgery were allocated randomly to receive fentanyl (non-stress group) or enflurane (stress group) {{as the main}} anaesthetic agent. After cardiopu/monary bypass (CPB), plas-ma arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations were significantly (P < 0. 001) greater in the stress group (81. 8 (46. 9 - 142. 9) pg mt 1, mean with 95 % con-fidence limits) than in the non-stress group (5. 8 (3. 3 - 10. 2) pg ml' 1). Plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations increased similarly in both groups after CPB. Plasma concentrations of both von Willebrand factor (stress: 1. 56 (1. 33 - 1. 79) iu ml' 1; non-stress: 1. 00 (0. 76 - 1. 25) iu ml- 1) and coagulation factor VIII: C (stress 1. 15 (0. 87 - 1. 44) iu ml' 1; non-stress: 0. 69 (0. 55 - 0. 80) iu ml' 1) were significantly (? < 0. 01) greater in the stress group than in the non-stress group after CPB.

In an approach mirroring routine laboratory conditions (spontaneous breathing, gas supply via nose mask, preventing hypothermia by a warming mat) a 50 min anaesthesia was performed. Anaesthetics were administered in oxygen as carrier gas at standardized dosages of 1. 5 minimum alveolar concentrations, which was 2. 8 % for isoflurane and 4. 9 % for sevoflurane. Both induction and recovery from anaesthesia proceeded quickly, within 1 - 2 min. During anaesthesia, all reflex testing was negative and no serious impairment of vital functions was found; all animals survived. The most prominent side-effect during anaesthesia was respiratory depression with hypercapnia, acidosis and a marked decrease in respiration rate. Under anaesthesia, heart rate and core body temperature remained within the normal range, but were significantly increased for 12 h after anaesthesia.

5000|$|In rare cases, {{repeated}} exposure to halothane in adults was noted {{to result in}} severe liver injury. This occurred in about one in 10,000 exposures. The resulting syndrome {{was referred to as}} halothane hepatitis, and is thought to result from the metabolism of halothane to trifluoroacetic acid via oxidative reactions in the liver. About 20% of inhaled halothane is metabolized by the liver and these products are excreted in the urine. The hepatitis syndrome had a mortality rate of 30% to 70%. Concern for hepatitis resulted in a dramatic reduction in the use of halothane for adults and it was replaced in the 1980s by enflurane and isoflurane. By 2005, the most common volatile anesthetics used were isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane. Since the risk of halothane hepatitis in children was substantially lower than in adults, halothane continued to be used in pediatrics in the 1990s as it was especially useful for <b>inhalation</b> induction of <b>anaesthesia</b> [...] However, by 2000, sevoflurane, excellent for inhalation induction, had largely replaced the use of halothane in children.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{provision}} of dental care for adults with severe learning disability presents problems. The approach to treatment {{has often been}} provided under general anaesthesia tending to result in exodontia rather than restorative care. This paper presents an alternative to this option using conscious sedation. Methods: A multi-centred retrospective audit was reported on using data from Canterbury, Warwick, Dorset and Cardiff. Patients included adults {{with varying degrees of}} disability for whom treatment using local <b>anaesthesia,</b> <b>inhalation</b> sedation, and the acceptance of intravenous cannulation was not possible. Sedation was provided by midazolam first administered by the intranasal followed by the intravenous route. Results: From a total of 222 episodes of sedation 128 (57. 65 %) accepted treatment well and 75 (33. 78 %) presented slight problems which did not compromise treatment. In 19 cases (8. 55 %) treatment with sedation was not possible and a referral was made for general anaesthesia. Conclusions: Results showed that a range of different treatments were carried out including advanced restorative care. This paper proposes that the technique described is safe and effective in providing a good standard of dental care for adults with severe learning disability. © 2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|The non-steady state {{metabolism}} of <b>inhalation</b> anaesthetics during <b>anaesthesia</b> {{and recovery}} was simulated with a linear and non-linear whole body compartmental model. These two models were studied for nine anaesthetics during 1 -MAC anaesthesias lasting 1, 4 and 8 h and recovery from 5 to 10 days. Both models demonstrated significant metabolism {{for several days}} following anaesthesia. For the linear model, both the percentage and the molar quantity of anaesthetic metabolized increased with increased duration of anaesthesia, increased anaesthetic fat solubility and increased assumed rate of hepatic metabolism. For the non-linear model, the duration of anaesthesia {{had little effect on}} the percentage metabolized but demonstrated increased molar quantities of anaesthetic metabolized with increased duration of anaesthesia and increased fat solubility. The agreement between the results obtained from the non-linear model and experimental data in the literature suggests that many inhalation anaesthetics belong to a class of xenobiotics whose biotransformation is limited by the same or similar non-linear rate-limiting step(s).

Anaesthesia was redefined as a triad of narcosis, analgesia and muscle relaxation, specific drugs being used to produce each of these effects 1. Muscle relaxants belong to two groups, the depolarizers and the nondepolarizers. Depolarizers mimic the effect of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, first causing muscle contractions (fasciculations) and then paralysing...|$|E
40|$|Few doctors gain fame as {{pioneers in}} one field; fewer still in two. Our contemporary, Sir James Black, {{is one of}} the latter: a Nobel Laureate, he {{developed}} two families of drugs – beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and H 2 inhibitors. John Snow is another: a pioneer of <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia,</b> he also proposed [1] then clarified [2] a role for faecally polluted matter in the spread of cholera. This latter discovery is stamped on the medical memory by the alleged termination of a cholera outbreak in an area just east of Regent Street when on 7 and 8 September 1854 Snow persuaded the St James’s parish vestreymen to remove the handle from the water-pump in Broad (now Broadwick) Street. (In fact the outbreak was nearly over before the pump handle was removed! [3]. ...|$|E
40|$|In infants& {{children}} {{variety of}} conditions and syndromes {{are associated with}} difficult Airway. Anaesthetic management becomes a challenge if it remains unrecognized until induction and sometimes results in disaster, leading to oropharyngeal trauma, laryngeal oedema, cardiovascular& neurological complications. A 4 -month-old child with multiple congenital anomalies was posted for cataract extraction for early and better development of vision. He had history of post birth respiratory distress, difficulty in feeding, breath holding with delayed mile stones. He was treated as for Juvenile asthma. This child was induced with <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> There was difficulty in laryngoscopic intubation and could pass much smaller size of the tube than predicted. He developed post operative stridor and desaturation. The problems which we faced during the anaesthetic management and during postoperative period are discussed with this case...|$|E
40|$|Anaesthetic {{management}} {{of a patient}} with thoracopagus We report {{the case of a}} 10 -day-old male child weighing 3. 5 kg, with mass over the sternal region, a set of four limbs and an omphalocoele that had undergone surgical separation. An exoparasitic twin had fully developed hind limbs, well-developed genitalia, one fully developed upper limb and another, underdeveloped upper limb. Echocardiography and a computed tomographic scan revealed no gross cardiac anomaly and the sharing of any other major organ was absent. The limbs of the parasite were lying in front of the neck and interfered with holding the mask in position. One anaesthetist held these limbs apart. We avoided the use of muscle relaxant out of fear that the large mass could hamper ventilation. The neonate was intubated successfully under deep <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia.</b> He had an uneventful recovery...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{quantified}} {{the predictive}} performance of our computer {{model of the}} administration of <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> from a Datex-Ohmeda Modulus CD circle-absorber system. METHODS: In 50 patients, desflurane anaesthesia was maintained with a fresh-gas flow (FGF) of 0. 5 litres min(- 1) of both nitrous oxide and oxygen, preceded by fast (n= 14) or slow (n= 36) induction: FGF greater than total ventilation, Group F; FGF equal to 1. 0 litres min(- 1), Group S. The {{two versions of the}} model studied differed in the size of their inter-tissue diffusion, as 0 (version 1) and 3 % (version 2) of the cardiac output was shifted from the viscera to adipose tissue. Model performance was judged by comparing measured and predicted gas concentrations in terms of three variables for each gas concentration in each patient: root mean squared error (rmse=total error), bias (mean predicted - measured) (systematic error), and scatter (error around bias). These variables were then averaged over all patients. These measures were calculated overall, and separately for each group and each stage (1 = induction or 2 = maintenance). RESULTS: Model predictions were in reasonable to very good agreement with clinically obtained data. Version 2 performed better than version 1. Differences between groups were not demonstrated. The model performed better for stage 2, but only for desflurane. In group S, results (mean (SD); as percentages of the measured values for nitrous oxide, oxygen and desflurane) in the order rmse, bias, and scatter were for end-tidal concentrations of nitrous oxide: 8 (4), 8 (5), 2 (1) %; oxygen: 11 (4), - 10 (6), 2 (1. 1) %; nitrogen: 0. 9 (0. 6), - 0. 8 (0. 6), 0. 2 (0. 1) vol%; carbon dioxide: 1. 8 (0. 6), 1. 8 (0. 6), 0. 2 (0. 1) vol%; desflurane, stage 2 : 8 (4), 4 (7), 4 (2) %, vs 15 (6), - 10 (8), 9 (4) % for stage 1. CONCLUSION: Administration of <b>inhalation</b> <b>anaesthesia</b> can be based on version 2 of this model, but must be guided by active monitoring...|$|E
