5|$|In 1991, Gregory Banks, {{a convicted}} felon, filed {{a civil suit}} for $16 million in damages against Burge, three colleagues, and the City of Chicago for condoning {{brutality}} and torture. He {{said that he had}} falsely confessed in 1983 to murder after he was tortured by officers: they placed a plastic bag over his head, put a gun in his mouth, and performed other acts. He said that the officers allegedly abused eleven other suspects, using such measures as <b>electro-shock.</b> The suit was brought by the People's Law Office attorneys who had represented Andrew Wilson in the 1989 police brutality case. The suit described 23 incidents against black and Hispanic suspects between 19721985. The Bank's suit named Sergeant Peter Dignan as one of the officers involved in the abuses. In 1995 Dignan was promoted for meritorious service, even though the City of Chicago had settled out of court with Banks on his suit.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{approaches}} to treating depression are suggested by many doctors. These treatments include exercise, dieting, hypnosis, <b>electro-shock</b> therapy, acupuncture, and herbs, amongst others. Many patients find that participating in these activities fully or partially alleviates symptoms related to depression.|$|E
25|$|Like many {{psychiatric}} hospitals, Dixmont became overcrowded {{during the}} 1920s {{due to the}} rise of PTSD patients from World War I. The hospital took in as many patients as they could fit until beds lined the hallways, but was eventually forced to stop accepting new admissions. Dixmont began experiencing financial difficulties as early as the Great Depression where they could only afford to supply employees with room and board; no salary. In 1946, the PA Department of Welfare had to step in and Dixmont became a state-owned hospital. During this time, the hospital began using previously decried procedures such as lobotomies, <b>electro-shock</b> therapy, and use of restraints.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{increasing}} problems with invasive rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) in the region, I tested {{the role of}} fish predation on crayfish in two northern Wisconsin lakes. At each lake, I sampled three types of substrate (sand, cobble, and macrophyte beds), along three different 50 -m transects (N = 9 per lake). Crayfish densities were estimated along each transect using 1 m 2 quadrants. I <b>electro-shocked</b> the lakes in these areas for fish and conducted gastric lavage to determine which fish species were preying on crayfish. I found a significant trend as fish size increased and the mean size of crayfish carapace consumed also increased. The fish species that most often consumed crayfish were smallmouth bass, rock bass, and yellow perch. Fish (across all species) also were found to significantly consume more crayfish in cobble areas...|$|R
25|$|The United Nations Committee against Torture {{reports that}} the use of Tasers can be a form of torture, due to the acute pain they cause, and warns against the {{possibility}} of death in some cases. The use of stun belts has been condemned by Amnesty International as torture, not only for the physical pain the devices cause, but also for their heightened abuse potential. Amnesty International has reported several alleged cases of excessive electroshock gun use that possibly amount to torture. They have also raised extensive concerns about the use of other <b>electro-shock</b> devices by American police and in American prisons, as they can be (and according to Amnesty International, sometimes are) used to inflict cruel pain on individuals.|$|E
25|$|Rivers {{spends his}} last day at the clinic saying goodbye to his patients, then travels to London and meets Dr. Yealland from the National Hospital, who will be his {{colleague}} in his new position. Dr. Yealland uses <b>electro-shock</b> therapy to force patients to quickly recover from shell-shock; he believes that some patients {{do not want to}} be cured and that pain is the best method of treatment for such reluctant patients. Rivers questions whether he can work with a man who uses such techniques. Soon Sassoon is released for combat duty; Willard is able to overcome his psychosomatic paralysis and walks again; Anderson is given a staff job. The novel ends with Rivers completing his notes, meditating on the effect that the encounter with Sassoon, and the last few months, have had on him.|$|E

40|$|Irrigation use is {{an obvious}} benefit of Utah canals that has been {{recognized}} for over 100 years. This study attempts to illustrate other, less obvious, uses. the major use examined was recreational, but canals are presently functioning as storm drainage systems and have potential for diverting flood crests in many river systems. Recreational use of canals falls into two categories. There is passive use such as its landscape values, affects on creating shade and bird-wildlife habitat, etc., {{that is difficult to}} quantify but no less important than active canal use such as tubing, hiking, bank-play, bicycling, etc. We selected several canals in and about Logan, Utah, and discovered considerable active use; this use will probably increase with suburban expansion. A Logan City canal that flowed year-round was also <b>electro-shocked</b> and found to have a resident brown trout population as great as many exceptional trout streams in the west. The multiple uses of our case study can best be summarized as a contrast between community benefits and conflict. In return for the thousands of hours of public enjoyment that irrigation companies now provide, they get nothing but problems. We feel if communities don 2 ̆ 7 t begin to recognize the value of their canals and cooperate with canal companies to equitably share in the cost of public use, then canals of Utah will continue to be withdrawn from public use and become another amenity that is sacrificed to urbanization...|$|R
50|$|Twice a year, {{partners}} including The Nature Conservancy, the Bureau of Land Management, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and Dr Peter Reinthal, {{professor at}} the University of Arizona, sample nine sites {{along the length of}} Aravaipa Canyon. Three of these sites are located at the west and east ends of the canyon respectively, and three are within the canyon itself. Various methods are used to survey the type and abundance of fish species present at each location. The most common of these is seining, a method that involves dragging a long net through the water and catching many fish at a time. This is best done by two individuals (one {{on either side of the}} net) who run downstream, scooping up the fish that are attempting to swim upstream against the current. Another form of seining involves the same two people on either side of the net, but this time they plant the edges of the net into the streambed. Then, another group of individuals form a line parallel to the net and kick up the water as they move toward the stationary net, driving fish into it. This approach works best on narrow side-channels that deviate from the wider stream’s flow. Yet another, less-used method is known as <b>electro-shocking.</b> This involves placing a set of electrodes in the water which send out a low-level electric pulse, temporarily stunning the fish in the immediate area. This makes catching and identifying the fish somewhat easier than seining, but some may say it has ethical implications as it can occasionally cause death to some fish if not expertly done.|$|R

500|$|In [...] "The Born-Again Identity", it's {{revealed}} that Castiel survived. After the Leviathans left him, {{he made his}} way out of the river, naked, and ran into his future wife Daphne. However, the experience renders Castiel amnesic, but with his angelic powers intact. Going by the name [...] "Emanuel", Castiel used his powers to heal people, though he didn't know where that ability and his power to see demon's true faces came from. After Sam is committed to a mental hospital as a result of the hallucinations of Lucifer he is suffering due to Castiel breaking his [...] "mental wall", Dean searches for [...] "Emanuel" [...] and kills a demon that is holding his wife hostage. Castiel agrees to help Dean who doesn't tell him who he really is, but mentions what [...] "Cas" [...] had done to Sam. The two are joined by Meg, but upon reaching the hospital, find demons surrounding the entrance. As Castiel is the only one who can take them all down, Dean is forced to tell him the truth about who he really is and insists he has the power to kill the demons. Castiel manages to summon his power to kill demons and kills all of them, but doing so restores his memories. Castiel shows remorse for his previous actions and initially wants to leave, but Dean is able to convince him to help by giving him back his trench coat. Castiel finds Sam in time to save him from a demon torturing him to death with <b>electro-shock</b> therapy and tries to restore his mental wall, but can't as it's completely gone. Feeling sorry for what he had done, Castiel transfers the problem to himself and is haunted by visions of Lucifer like Sam was. Castiel is committed to the mental hospital, but is safe from the demons as only Meg knows he's alive and she takes a job at the hospital, presumably to look after him. In [...] "Party On, Garth", Dean calls Meg and she reveals that Castiel's in the same condition, which Sam feels guilty about.|$|E
