5|$|The Western Ghats {{are home}} to four {{tropical}} and subtropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregions – the North Western Ghats moist deciduous <b>forests,</b> North Western Ghats montane rain <b>forests,</b> South Western Ghats moist deciduous <b>forests,</b> and South Western Ghats montane rain <b>forests.</b> The northern portion of the range is generally drier than the southern portion, and at lower elevations makes up the North Western Ghats moist deciduous <b>forests</b> ecoregion, with mostly deciduous <b>forests</b> made up predominantly of teak.

5|$|The {{evergreen}} <b>forests</b> in Wayanad {{mark the}} transition zone between {{the northern and}} southern ecologic regions of the Western Ghats.

The moist <b>forests</b> transition to the drier South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous <b>forests,</b> which lie in its rain shadow to the east. Above 1,000 meters are the South Western Ghats montane rain <b>forests,</b> also cooler and wetter than the surrounding lowland <b>forests,</b> and dominated by evergreen trees, although some montane grasslands and stunted <b>forests</b> {{can be found at the}} highest elevations.

5|$|The fossa has {{the most}} {{widespread}} geographical range of the Malagasy carnivores, and is generally found in low numbers throughout the island in remaining tracts of forest, preferring pristine undisturbed forest habitat.

Although the fossa is found in all known forest habitats throughout Madagascar, including the western, dry deciduous <b>forests,</b> the eastern rainforests, and the southern spiny <b>forests,</b> it is seen more frequently in humid than in dry <b>forests.</b> This may be because the reduced canopy in dry <b>forests</b> provides less shade, and also because the fossa seems to travel more easily in humid <b>forests.</b> It is absent from areas with the heaviest habitat disturbance and, like most of Madagascar's fauna, from the central high plateau of the country.|$|E

5|$|The {{western and}} {{southern}} sides, which {{lie in the}} rain shadow of the central highlands, are home to dry deciduous <b>forests,</b> spiny <b>forests,</b> and deserts and xeric shrublands.

40|$|The <b>forest</b> fire during May 6 - June 4, 1987 in Daxinganling of Northeastern China {{has changed}} greatly the <b>forest</b> {{structure}} and <b>forest</b> biomass.

5|$|Although fishers are {{competent}} tree climbers, {{they spend}} most of their time on the forest floor and prefer continuous forest to other habitats. Fishers have been found in extensive conifer <b>forests</b> typical of the boreal forest but are also common in mixed hardwood and conifer <b>forests.</b> Fishers prefer areas with continuous overhead cover with greater than 80% coverage and will avoid areas with less than 50% coverage. Fishers are more likely to be found in old-growth <b>forests.</b> Since female fishers require moderately large trees for denning, <b>forests</b> that have been heavily logged and have extensive second growth appears to be unsuitable for their needs.|$|E

50|$|The Fourth National <b>Forest</b> Plan {{entered a}} {{transitional}} phase of <b>forest</b> policies from mainly focusing economic functions to enhancing overall <b>forest</b> benefits including public and recreational benefits.

The government-led <b>forest</b> management policies turned into autonomic <b>forest</b> management in the private <b>forest</b> sector, based on the capability and discretion of <b>forest</b> owners.
