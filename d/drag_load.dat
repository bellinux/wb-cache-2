40|$|This report {{attempts}} to analyze {{in detail the}} spin-up drag loads imposed upon an aircraft main landing gear. Other factors in the landing gear problem are ignored except insofar as they affect this one type of loading. As an instrument for study, one model of aircraft was chosen for which extensive flight test and drop test data were available. The main parameters which enter into the spin-up <b>drag</b> <b>load</b> are the landing weight of the aircraft, the rate of descent at contact, the ground speed, the time interval from initial contact to attainment of maximum vertical load, and the coefficient of friction between the tire and the runway surface. Minor parameters which may affect the <b>drag</b> <b>load</b> are the tire pressure, moment of inertia of the rolling stock, oleo pressure, and quantity {{of oil in the}} hydraulic shock absorber. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the maximum gear <b>drag</b> <b>load</b> is primarily a function of the time required to reach maximum vertical load, and that further study of this parameter, using drop test data for several types of aircraft, might well lead to some valuable empirical information essential to landing gear design. The value of the coefficient of friction was seen to vary widely in test landings but a maximum value of 0. 55 appears to be satisfactory for limit design calculations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVortex Induced Vibration (VIV) is {{a typical}} flow-structure {{interference}} phenomenon which causes an unsteady flow pattern due to vortex shedding {{at or near the}} structure's natural frequency leading to resonant vibrations. VIV may cause premature fatigue failure of marine risers and pipelines. A test model was carried out to investigate the role of a stationary fairing by varying the caudal horn angle to suppress riser VIV taking into account the effect of wake interference. The test results show significant reduction of VIV for risers disposed in tandem and side-by-side. In general, fairing with a caudal horn of 45 ° and 60 ° are efficient in quelling VIV in risers. The results also reveal fairing can reduce the <b>drag</b> <b>load</b> of risers arranged side-by-side.

40|$|This work {{pertains}} to the development effort involved in the deployment of an additional winglike aerodynamic surface {{referred to as a}} “mousche” for the naval version of a typical military aircraft. The mousche is attached to the forebody of the naval aircraft. It is deployed only during landing (and retracted at all other times) in order to improve the landing characteristics of the aircraft on the aircraft carrier. The mousche is designed and constructed out of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic to withstand the full load and is deployed using the actuator bank containing the arrays of shape memory alloy elements. The shape memory alloy actuator bank moves a distance of 15 mm while generating a net actuator force of over 2000 kg. This force is used to deploy the additional aerodynamic surface measuring 790 � 215 � 32 mmagainst a simulated lift and <b>drag</b> <b>load</b> acting simultaneously, i. e., a resultant lift load of 331. 6 kg and a <b>drag</b> <b>load</b> of 33. 16 kg acting at the center of gravity of the mousche.

The mousche has been analyzed using finite element method codes for the combined lift and <b>drag</b> <b>load.</b> Experimental and analysis values have matched well.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze the statics and dynamics of steel smoke stacks subject to excitation by aerodynamic forces. The wind loads experienced by smoke stacks arise from various phenomenon, the most prominent of which are static <b>drag</b> <b>load,</b> vortex shedding, and atmospheric turbulence. The nature of these loading sources around a cylinder are studied in detail. Both static and dynamic loads are capable of producing large tip deflections, and are of the most prominent design criteria for stack designers. A computer program, STACK 1, has been created by modifying an existing analysis code, BEAM 8, to be used specifically for stack analysis. This analysis code utilizes the transfer matrix method to perform detailed bending and vibration analyses. This new software has been developed to check stack designs for compliance with appropriate steel stack standards, and provide the designer with information regarding the static and dynamic response of the structure.

40|$|Collapsible soil is {{a special}} type of soil, {{classified}} as problematic soil. It possesses a high strength in the unsaturated phase and loses its strength and exhibits substantial settlement when inundated. Many foundation failures occur around the world, many of which involve loss of lives, caused by problems associated with collapsible soils. One {{of the most commonly}} used type of foundation in collapsible soils is end-bearing piles resting on firm soil strata. However, these piles will be subjected to negative skin friction during wetting of the collapsible soil, inducing additional loads. Various case studies have reported foundation failures and excessive settlements upon the wetting of collapsible soil. Researchers are facing serious challenges in dealing with piles in collapsible soils due to the complexity of the problem and the difficulties associated with modeling this behaviour numerically and experimentally. Relatively few investigations pertinent to pile foundations in collapsible soils subjected to inundation are available in the literature. An experimental investigation was carried out to simulate the complex interaction between collapsible soil and a single end-bearing pile under various wetting and loading conditions. The experimental prototype setup was developed and calibrated in the laboratory in order to measure the <b>drag</b> <b>load</b> and accordingly the negative skin friction acting on the pile’s shaft for given soil/wetting/loading conditions.

40|$|The Southeast Asia metocean {{environment}} {{is characterized by}} moderate wind and waves with relatively strong and persistent currents. The design of a Tension Leg Platform (TLP) for Southeast Asia is strongly affected by the current and resulting <b>drag</b> <b>loads,</b> particularly if many risers are required. To reduce vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of offshore tubular members i. e. top tension risers (TTRs), vortex suppression devices such as helical strakes and fairings are used. This paper gives an insight into a set of riser VIV model tests which is carried out to study the effectiveness of an open-back "U"-shaped fairing in suppressing riser VIV.

40|$|A unified viscous {{theory of}} 2 -D thin {{airfoils}} and 3 -D thin wings is developed with numerical examples. The viscous {{theory of the}} load distribution is unique and tends to the classical inviscid result with Kutta condition in the high Reynolds number limit. A new theory of 2 -D section induced drag is introduced with specific applications to three cases of interest: (1) constant angle of attack; (2) parabolic camber; and (3) a flapped airfoil. The first case is also extended to a profiled leading edge foil. The well-known drag due to absence of leading edge suction {{is derived from the}} viscous theory. It is independent of Reynolds number for zero thickness and varies inversely with the square root of the Reynolds number based on the leading edge radius for profiled sections. The role of turbulence in the section induced drag problem is discussed. A theory of minimum section induced drag is derived and applied. For low Reynolds number the minimum <b>drag</b> <b>load</b> tends to the constant angle of attack solution and for high Reynolds number to an approximation of the parabolic camber solution. The parabolic camber section induced drag is about 4 percent greater than the ideal minimum at high Reynolds number. Two new concepts, the viscous induced drag angle and the viscous induced separation potential are introduced. The separation potential is calculated for three 2 -D cases and for a 3 -D rectangular wing. The potential is calculated with input from a standard doublet lattice wing code without recourse to any boundary layer calculations. Separation is indicated in regions where it is observed experimentally. The classical induced drag is recovered in the 3 -D high Reynolds number limit with an additional contribution that is Reynold number dependent. The 3 -D viscous theory of minimum induced drag yields an equation for the optimal spanwise and chordwise load distribution. The design of optimal wing tip planforms and camber distributions is possible with the viscous 3 -D wing theory...|$|E
40|$|Vortex induced {{vibration}} (VIV) {{occurs when}} a body is exposed to a fluid flow that causes an unsteady flow pattern due to vortex shedding {{at or near the}} structure's natural frequency leading to resonant vibrations. This phenomenon frequently happens in slender elements such as risers used in deepwater oil and gas developments. Such vibrations may reduce the fatigue life of the riser, potentially causing catastrophic damage to the integrity of the system and the environment. Installation of VIV suppression devices onto risers will alter the vortex shedding patterns, thus able to mitigate VIV. A model test was carried out to study the effectiveness of a newly developed U-shaped fairing in reducing drag and VIV of risers. The U-shaped fairing is an alternative of conventional spiral strakes and tear-drop-shaped fairings for riser VIV suppression. The model test findings offer useful information for its industrial application in suppressing riser VIV. The model test was performed in a towing tank facility in Malaysia located at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). Current flow was simulated by towing a vertically submerged scaled-down riser section underwater with a moving carriage. The riser model was attached to a custom-designed test rig to replicate a section of the actual riser and to simulate its 2 D motions. The model riser was tested in three different conditions, i. e. (a) bare riser without fairing; (b) riser with weathervaning fairing (normal condition) and (c) riser with fairing stuck at different orientations (abnormal condition). The test results show significant reduction of VIV on the model riser with fairing under normal condition. In addition, it is found that the <b>drag</b> <b>load</b> for the riser with fairing is significantly lower compared to that of a bare riser or a typical straked riser. This test marks a significant collaboration between a local research institute and the offshore oil and gas industry, aligned with the initiative of increasing local capabilities. Effective mitigation of VIV of risers using suppression devices could lead to improved riser fatigue life and overall a more economical platform design...|$|E
40|$|The {{trend in}} recent years has been that the amount of wild catch is stagnating. In this {{perspective}} the selectivity of fishing gear has become an important issue. The aim of the present work has been to develop a three-dimensional model for the flow in front and inside a net structure, such as a trawl, to be able to predict and calculate selectivity of net structures. A net consist of twines which connect in knots and make up a mesh. The diameter of a twine can be from 1 [mm] in net cages up to a few centimeters in the front part of a trawl. And similar the size of the mesh can be from 1 [cm] up to the order of a meter. Typical Reynolds number range, related to the diameter of a twine, is O(10 2 − 10 4). An examination of numerical results for the drag force on plane net structure demonstrates a strong dependency of the drag force on a net structure with both the geometry, in terms of Solidity ratio, and the Reynolds number. And in particular a non-uniform relation between the drag force and the Solidity ratio. It is evident that for increasing Solidity ratios, flow interaction will become increasingly significant. The physical design of the knot part contributes largely to this flow interaction. The net structure is divided into discrete elements. The twines are modeled as separate cylinders between knots and the knots are modeled as separate spheres. Typically the total number of twines in a trawl could be in the order of 10 6 and it is thus impractical to model every single twine. It is assumed that for a given Reynolds number, keeping the Solidity ratio constant, the total drag on the trawl will be independent on the actual diameter and mesh opening of the net. First each of these different elements is modeled as a set of source distributions and single point sources. The influence from the net on the fluid flow is then calculated by representing the wake generated by each element as source distributions along the structural element. To determine the strength of these sources the principle of Lagally is applied. Then a set of equations is obtained, describing the relation between the fluid velocity and the source strength at every element. Based on this approach, a method is presented to calculate the drag force on net structures with high solidity. The method uses appropriate drag coefficients related to the geometry of the twines and the knots and account for the change in the inflow due to the presence of the net structure and at the same time changes the geometry of the net structure due to the load. Secondly the interaction between the net elements, due to the physical generation of a wake flow behind each individual element of the net, has been studied using a time-averaged wake model. Modifications are applied to the far-field mean velocity deficit mode by Schlichting (1968). This to better describe the the near-field behavior and the added effect of the wake from many individual cylindrical elements. It is shown that the wake model by Blevins (1990) can be used. The method is verified against experiments, as means of calculating the drag on plane nets as a function of Reynolds number, Solidity ratio and angle of attack and gives reasonable good agreement. During the experiments some interesting three-dimensional effects regarding the flow around cylinders were discovered. Negative lift forces occurring on the downstream cylinder in a staggered arrangement is explained as interactions due to upstream generated vortices. To create a three-dimensional method where the inflow on each of the cylinders is corrected due to the presence of all the other cylinders, these two models are added together. Further, a structural analysis of the net structure, using a FEM method, is included in the model. A more complete description of the problem is obtained by combining the change in the inflow due to the presence of the net structure, with a correction of the shape and geometry due to the <b>drag</b> <b>load.</b> Results from numerical simulation of different kinds of net structures, show that the elasticity in the net structure has a significant influence on the resulting geometry and calculated results. Further, the numerical results for net cages have been compared to experimental results. Good agreement between the numerical results and the experimental result is seen. Also the resulting geometry from the experimental results was recreated satisfactory using the present method. For three-dimensional cone shaped net structures, in contrast to net panels and net cages, the presented numerical results do not indicate a large influence on the drag force due to changes in geometry. The agreement between the numerical and experimental results for fluid velocity in front and inside of a three-dimensional net structure, compared to experimental results, was reasonably good. Quantitatively the results do not match exactly, but the characteristics of the flow are recreated. Further, based on the numerical results for the fluid velocity, pressure field in front of a cone is presented. The relative pressure gradient is shown to be minimal, and it is not likely than any fish will detect this change in pressure field neither by direct pressure sensing nor by any sound created from any shed vortices. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
