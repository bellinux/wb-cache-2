40|$|Abstract: The {{secretion}} of gonadotropins (GtH) in goldfish and carp, is {{stimulated by}} GtH-releasing hormone (GnRH) and is inhibited by dopamine. Studies with antidopaminergics have demonstrated {{to be effective}} in order to stimulate the spermiation and the ovulation in different species of teleosts. The reserpine, a drug that <b>deplets</b> the dopamine, has shown to stimulate the spermiation in the common carp. We report here, the effects of reserpine on the number and volume of gonadotrophic cells of the common carp. Eight injections of reserpine alone, at doses of 0. 5, 1. 0 or 1. 5 mg/ml/kg of body weight and at intervals of 48 hours, caused {{an increase in the number}} and volume of gonadotrophic cells. The dose 0. 5 mg/ml/kg, presented an increase in the number and volume of gonadotrophic cells of 382 % and 123 %, respectively, above the control group. The dose 1. 0 mg/ml/kg, showed an enhanced number and volume of gonadotrophic cells of 704 % and 152 %, respectively. With the dose 1. 5 mg/ml/kg increase in number (171 %) and volume (106 %) of gonadotrophic cells was lower. The gonads of the experimental groups had an abundance of advanced states of spermatogenesis. Our results show that eight intraperitoneal injections of reserpine were responsible for an increase in gonadodrophic cell, number and volume...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Abundances of 11 {{chemical}} elements have been determined for 29 F and 19 A dwarfs (“normal ” and chemically peculiar with apparent rotational velocities ranging from 11 to 237 km. s − 1) {{members of the}} Hyades cluster using Takeda’s (1995) iterative procedure well suited for fast rotators. High quality spectra of high to moderate resolution have been synthesized to derive the apparent rotational velocities, microturbulent velocities and abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Sc, Fe, Ni, Y and Ba. For the F stars, the found abundances are compared to the predictions of Turcotte et al. ’s (1998) evolutionary models for {{the age of the}} Hyades. We fail to find the expected underabundances for light elements nor the overabundances for the ironpeak elements for stars having effective temperatures greater than 6500 K. This suggests that diffusion alone cannot account for the derived abundances: other transport processes which counteract diffusion are probably at play. For the A stars, abundances of Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Fe, Ni and Ba are anticorrelated (correlated for O) with the apparent equatorial velocities for ve sin i higher than ∼ 100 km. s − 1. Below this value, we find no correlation in agreement with the predictions of Charbonneau & Michaud (1991) except possibly for the abundance of Ni which might be anticorrelated with ve sin i. The fastest rotators (ve sin i ≥ 150 km. s − 1) are strongly <b>depletted</b> in Mg, Si, Ca, Fe, Ni and Ba (between − 0. 3 dex and − 0. 94 dex) while their O abundance is normal...|$|R

40|$|The anodic {{saturation}} current density of an n-type Si or Ge electrode is considerably larger in chemical etching solutions than in nonetching solutions because the chemical etching process produces excess holes {{at the surface}} of the semiconductor. The rate at which these excess holes become available to the electrolytic anodic dissolution reaction is proportional to the chemical etch-ing rate, the surface recombination velocity, and the anodic multiplication factor. Three practical applications of the experiment are indicated: (a) a monitor for chemically etching semiconductors; (b) a tool to study the process of chemical etching; and (c) a simple method for fluoride ion analysis. The saturat ion or l imit ing current observed for the anodic dissolution of n- type Ge or Si in a suitable electrolyte has been shown by Brat ta in and Garrett (1) and others (2, 3) to be due to a <b>deplet</b> ion of holes at the electrode surface.

40|$|In {{order to}} detect early-stage diseases, new {{biomarkers}} are needed that have adequate {{sensitivity and specificity}} to be applicable in detecting diseases in a large population. The classical approach for identifying disease-related proteins is two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but this method is labor intensive, requires large amounts of protein, and is not easily adapted into a diagnostic test. Recent studies have reported using mass spectrometry (MS) to identify new serum biomarkers for breast and ovarian cancer. Serum contains 60 - 80 mg protein/mL, but 57 - 71 % of this is serum albumin, and 8 - 26 % is γ-globulins. These large proteins must be depleted before smaller less-abundant proteins can be detected using MS. Affinity columns are commonly used to remove both serum albumin and γ-globulins, but because serum albumin is known {{to act as a}} carrier for smaller proteins, removal of these molecules using columns may result in the loss of molecules of interest.

40|$|The {{changing}} patterns of riverine boron concentration are examined for the Thames catchment in southern southeastern England {{using data from}} 1997 to 2007. Boron concentrations are related to an independent 28 marker for sewage effluent, sodium. The results show that boron concentrations in the main river channels have declined with time especially under baseflow conditions when sewage effluent dilution potential is at its lowest. While boron concentrations have reduced, especially under low-flow conditions, this does not fully translate to a corresponding reduction in boron flux {{and it seems that}} the “within-catchment” supplies of boron to the river are contaminated by urban sources. The estimated boron reduction in the effluent input to the river based on the changes in river chemistry is typically around 60 % and this figure matches with an initial survey of more limited data for the industrial north of England. Data for effluent concentrations at eight sewage treatment works within the Kennet also indicate substantial reductions in boron concentrations: 80 % reduction occurred between 2001 and 2008. For the more contaminated rivers there are issues of localised rather than catchment-wide sources and uncertainties over the extent and nature of water/boron stores. Atmospheric sources average around 32 to 61 % for the cleaner and 4 to 14 % for the more polluted parts. The substantial decreases in the boron concentrations correspond extremely well with the timing and extent of European wide trends for reductions in the industrial and domestic usage of boron-bearing compounds. It clearly indicates that such reductions have translated into lower average and peak concentrations of boron in the river although the full extent of these reductions has probably not yet occurred due to localised stores that are still to <b>deplet...</b>|$|E

40|$|Energy {{is one of}} {{the most}} vital contribut ions to {{sustainable}} development strategy of Sri Lanka. However, the r ising cost of energy generation, the <b>deplet</b> ion and the unpredictability of availability of energy resources and the adverse impacts of energy generation and its usage on the environment, have been causing much anxiety and great concern from recent t imes. Within this context, buildings have been considered as one of the largest consumers of energy and have therefore been ident ified as one of the target areas for energy conservat ion. Statistics have revealed that the proportion of energy consumed for light ing in buildings is much greater than what is consumed ind ividually for providing thermal comfort or other ancillary services. Therefore adding of daylight for space, architectural designing has become a vital overcomes above problems. Adding adequate sunlight, integration with artificial light ing and reducing the cooling load on HVAC systems are effect ively providing wide energy savings in buildings and houses. The principle object ive in this research is therefore to explore strategies of designing buildings with opt imal utilisation of natural light, efficient application of electrical energy for inter ior light ing and minimising energy usage of HVAC systems. A simulation modelling on daylight implementation was carried out under this research, with different kinds of light ing arrangement against a few different external characteristics within the control of the designer. The computer simulation software DIALUX 4. 11 version was used to analyse illuminat ion level inside the building and a n extensive literature survey on maximising ut ilisation of daylight and its effect on HVAC system was also carried out under this research project. As per the research energy savings from daylight design in buildings cannot be realized unless the electric lights are dimmed or switched in response to the amount of available daylight. The analysis results shows, that there is potential for saving 51 % of energy consumed for building light ing with daylight implementation for the building. But due to practical limitation, exist ing light ing arrangement is not suitable for daylight implementation and therefor e new light ing arrangement was considered under this research and new light ing arrangement shows that there is potent ial for 50 % of energy saving with daylight integration. The analysis was further carried out for new type of luminar ies to find out further energy saving potent ial with implementation of energy saving lights with integration of daylight. This analysis results shows, that there is potent ial for 52 % of energy saving with new type of luminaries and its arrangement. Effect on HVAC system due to daylight implementation was also analysed and it is shown that there is 10 % increase of building cooling load due to daylight implementation. Also this research presents guide lines for designing of daylight efficient buildings light ing systems to contribute towards energy conservation, environmental protect ion and establishment of sustainable economic system as well. This research can be further extended to analysis for different kind of building with different wall colouring and internal objects arrangement for opt imal energy saving with daylight implementation for commercial buildings...|$|E
