Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or <b>glueing)</b> allow us to distinguish a polygon from an annulus (ring with a hole in the centre), but do not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{aircraft}} {{of the era}} {{are often}} described a constructed of sticks and canvas their construction was of considerable sophistication. [...] Wooden construction typically involved several different types of timber, with careful use of different woods according to their mechanical properties; ash and spruce were the most commonly used, although hickory, mahogany and poplar were among the other timbers employed. [...] Struts were frequently [...] hollow members formed by spindling out two pieces of wood and then <b>glueing</b> them together, usually using a tongue in groove joint to strengthen the joint. Wing spars were also often composite members, and the wing ribs were complex structures. [...] When flying replicas of the 1910 Bristol Boxkite were made for the 1966 film Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, a modern stress analysis was performed, {{and concluded that the}} airframe was close to conforming to modern requirements.|$|E
2500|$|Before the A-12, {{titanium}} {{was used}} only in high-temperature exhaust fairings {{and other small}} parts directly related to supporting, cooling, or shaping high-temperature areas on aircraft like those subject to the greatest kinetic heating from the airstream, such as wing leading edges. The A-12, however, was constructed mainly of titanium. Titanium is quite rigid and difficult to machine, which {{made it difficult to}} form into curves given available techniques. This made the construction of the leading edges of the wing and similar surfaces difficult to form. The solution was found by machining only small [...] "fillets" [...] of the material with the required shape and then <b>glueing</b> them onto the underlying framework which was more linear. A good example is on the wing; the underlying framework of spars and stringers formed a grid, leaving triangular notches along the leading edge that were filled with fillets.|$|E
2500|$|Clothing {{wore out}} quickly: the {{tropical}} climate meant that clothes {{had to be}} washed every day, and the rigours of labouring in them meant that they soon became torn, worn and threadbare. An enterprising male internee, J. R. Baxter, entered the camp with two pairs of shorts; as they wore out he constructed a new pair from them by <b>glueing</b> together the constituent parts with latex from the rubber trees growing in the camp. The Japanese did not provide replacement clothing for the prisoners when their clothes wore out. After a period male internees and POWs were issued with a loincloth and perishable rubber shoes, which soon degraded and meant in effect that most prisoners went barefoot. The women fared a little better, often bartering possessions for material: clothes were fashioned out of whatever material was to hand, such as sheets and breakfast cloths. [...] Many of the women kept their best clothes unworn in readiness for their expected eventual liberation, while their other clothes {{became more and more}} shabby.|$|E
50|$|Hide <b>glue</b> {{is used in}} woodworking. It may be {{supplied}} as granules, flakes, or flat sheets, which have an indefinite shelf life if kept dry. It is dissolved in water, heated and applied warm, typically around 60°C (140°F). Warmer temperatures quickly destroy the strength of hide <b>glue.</b> Commercial <b>glue</b> pots, simple water baths or double boilers {{may be used to}} keep the <b>glue</b> hot while in use. As hide <b>glue</b> cools, it gels quickly. At room temperature, prepared hide <b>glue</b> has the consistency of stiff gelatin, which is in fact a similar composition. Gelled hide <b>glue</b> does not have significant strength, so it is vital to apply the <b>glue,</b> fit the pieces, and hold them steady before the <b>glue</b> temperature drops much below 50°C (120°F). All <b>glues</b> have an open time, the amount of time the <b>glue</b> remains liquid and workable. Joining parts after the open time is expired results in a weak bond. Hide <b>glue's</b> open time is usually a minute or less. In practice, this often means having to heat the pieces to be <b>glued,</b> and <b>gluing</b> in a very warm room, though these steps can be dispensed with if the <b>glue</b> and clamp operation can be carried out quickly.|$|R
50|$|The {{significant}} {{disadvantages of}} hide <b>glue</b> - its thermal limitations, short open time, and vulnerability to micro-organisms - are offset by several advantages. Hide <b>glue</b> joints are reversible and repairable. Recently <b>glued</b> joints will release easily with {{the application of}} heat and steam. Hide <b>glue</b> sticks to itself, so the repairer can apply new hide <b>glue</b> to the joint and reclamp it. In contrast, PVA <b>glues</b> do not adhere to themselves once they are cured, so a successful repair requires removal of the old <b>glue</b> first - which usually requires removing some of the material being <b>glued.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} prey capture <b>glues</b> {{produced}} by orb-weaving spiders (viscid <b>glue)</b> and their evolutionary descendents, the cobweb-weaving spiders (gumfoot <b>glue).</b> These <b>glues</b> are produced in homologous glands but exhibit contrasting structure, properties {{and response to}} changing humidity. Individual <b>glue</b> droplet stretching measurements indicate that the gumfoot <b>glue</b> behaves like a viscoelastic liquid {{in contrast to the}} viscid <b>glue,</b> which behaves like a viscoelastic solid. Moreover, the gumfoot <b>glue</b> is largely humidity-resistant – elasticity and adhesion are constant across variation in humidity and there is weak volume-dependence. Viscid <b>glue,</b> however, is highly humidity-sensitive. The <b>glue</b> expands an order of magnitude and demonstrates a monotonous reduction in elasticity under increased humidity, while <b>glue</b> adhesion optimizes at intermediate levels of humidity. We suggest that observed differences are due to different ‘tackifiers' used in these systems. These results shall inspire future efforts in fabricating stimuli-resistant and stimuli-sensitive materials...|$|R

50|$|Hide <b>glue</b> regains its working {{properties}} after cooling {{if it is}} reheated. This property can be {{used when}} the <b>glue's</b> open time does not allow the joint to be <b>glued</b> normally. For example, a cello maker {{may not be able}} to <b>glue</b> and clamp a top to the instrument's ribs in the short one-minute open time available. Instead, the builder will lay a bead of <b>glue</b> along the ribs, and allow it to cool. The top is then clamped to the ribs. Moving a few inches at a time, the maker inserts a heated palette knife into the joint, heating the <b>glue.</b> When the <b>glue</b> is liquefied, the palette knife is removed, and the <b>glue</b> cools, creating a bond. A similar process can be used to <b>glue</b> veneers to a substrate. The veneer and/or the substrate is coated with hot hide <b>glue.</b> Once the <b>glue</b> is cold, the veneer is positioned on the substrate. A hot object such as a clothes iron is applied to the veneer, liquefying the underlying <b>glue.</b> When the iron is removed, the <b>glue</b> cools, bonding the veneer to the substrate.|$|R

60|$|After six weeks' {{confinement}} to {{the house}} I was at length well, and could resume my daily walks in the forest. I did not, however, find it so productive as when I had first arrived at Dobbo. There was a damp stagnation about the paths, and insects were very scarce. In {{some of my best}} collecting places I now found a mass of rotting wood, mingled with young shoots, and overgrown with climbers, yet I always managed to add something daily to my extensive collections. I one day met with a curious example of failure of instinct, which, by showing it to be fallible, renders it very doubtful whether it is anything more than hereditary habit, dependent on delicate modifications of sensation. Some sailors cut down a good-sized tree, and, as is always my practice, I visited it daily for some time in search of insects. Among other beetles came swarms of the little cylindrical woodborers (Platypus, Tesserocerus, &c.), and commenced making holes in the bark. After a day or two I was surprised to find hundreds of them sticking in the holes they had bored, and on examination discovered that the milky sap of the tree was of the nature of gutta-percha, hardening rapidly on exposure to the air, and <b>glueing</b> the little animals in self-dug graves. The habit of boring holes in trees in which to deposit their eggs, was not accompanied by a sufficient instinctive knowledge of which trees were suitable, and which destructive to them. If, as is very probable, these trees have an attractive odour to certain species of borers, it might very likely lead to their becoming extinct; while other species, to whom the same odour was disagreeable, and who therefore avoided the dangerous trees, would survive, and would be credited by us with an instinct, whereas they would really be guided by a simple sensation.|$|E
60|$|The coral mud, which {{occupies}} {{the bottom of}} the lagoon, and with which all the interstices of the coral skeletons which accumulate to form the reef are filled up, does not proceed from the washing action of the waves alone; innumerable fishes, and other creatures which prey upon the coral, add a very important contribution of finely-triturated calcareous matter; and the corals and mud becoming incorporated together, gradually harden and give rise to a sort of limestone rock, which may vary a good deal in texture. Sometimes it remains friable and chalky, but, more often, the infiltration of water, charged with carbonic acid, dissolves some of the calcareous matter, and deposits it elsewhere in the interstices of the nascent rock, thus <b>glueing</b> and cementing the particles together into a hard mass; or it may even dissolve the carbonate of lime more extensively, and re-deposit it in a crystalline form. On the beach of the lagoon, where the coral sand is washed into layers by the action of the waves, its grains become thus fused together into strata of a limestone, so hard that they ring when struck with a hammer, and inclined at a gentle angle, corresponding with that of the surface of the beach. The hard parts of the many animals which live upon the reef become imbedded in this coral limestone, so that a block may be full of shells of bivalves and univalves, or of sea urchins; and even sometimes encloses the eggs of turtles in a state of petrification. The active and vigorous growth of the reef goes on only at the seaward margins, where the polypes are exposed to the wash of the surf, and are thereby provided with an abundant supply of air and of food. The interior portion of the reef may be regarded as almost wholly an accumulation of dead skeletons. Where a river comes down from the land there is a break in the reef, for the reasons which have been already mentioned.|$|E

5000|$|Animal <b>glue,</b> {{especially}} hide <b>glue,</b> was {{the primary}} adhesive of choice for a great many types of woodworking, including furniture and lutherie, for many centuries.

Hide <b>glue</b> is still used today in specialized applications: musical instruments (lutherie), for replica furniture, and for conservation-grade repairs to antique woodwork.
