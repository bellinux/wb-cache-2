40|$|Various {{diagnostic}} {{methods were}} {{used to evaluate the}} effect of fungicide protection on the prevalence of pathogenic fungi in wheat grain. Winter wheat cv. Nutka and Zyta was grown during a field experiment established in the Production and Experimental Station in Bałcyny in 2006 – 2007. The experimental factor was chemical crop protection: epoxiconazole, kresoxim-methyl and fenpropimorph applied at growth stages BBCH 33 – 35 as well as <b>dimoxystrobin</b> and epoxiconazole applied at BBCH 51 – 53. In this experiment, microscopic observations and conventional PCR assays were used as complementary methods. The quantification of Fusarium poae DNA by qPCR demonstrated the effectiveness of chemical protection against the analyzed fungal species. Lower monthly precipitation levels and higher daily temperatures intensified grain infections, in particular those caused by F. poae. A significant correlation was determined between the number of F. poae cultures isolated from winter wheat grain and the quantity of pathogenic DNA in grain identified by qPCR. Grain infections caused by F. poae lowered yield and thousand seed weight...|$|E
40|$|Ambient mass {{spectrometry}} {{has been used}} for the analysis of strobilurin residues in wheat. The use of this novel, challenging technique, employing a direct analysis in a real time (DART) ion-source coupled with a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF MS) and a desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) source coupled with a linear ion trap tandem MS (LIT MSn), permitted a direct screen of the occurrence of target fungicides in treated grains in less than 1 min. For quantification purpose by DART-TOF MS, an ethyl acetate extract had to be prepared. With the use of a prochloraz as an internal standard, the performance characteristics obtained by repeated analyses of extract, spiked at 50 ¿g kg¿ 1 with six strobilurins (azoxystrobin, picoxystrobin, <b>dimoxystrobin,</b> kresoxim-methyl, pyraclostrobin, and trifloxystrobin), were in the following range: recoveries 78 ¿ 92 %, repeatability (RSD) 8 ¿ 15 %, linearity (R 2) 0. 9900 ¿ 0. 9978. The analysis of wheat with incurred strobilurin residues demonstrated good trueness of data generated by the DART-TOF MS method; the results were in a good agreement with those obtained by the conventional approach, i. e., by the QuEChERS sample handling procedure followed by identification/quantification employing high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem {{mass spectrometry}} (LC¿MS/MS). Tandem mass spectrometry using DESI-LIT MSn provided a sufficient number of product ions for confirmation of the identity of azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin in incurred wheat samples...|$|E
40|$|The Water Framework Directive 60 / 2000 /EG (WFD) {{requires}} Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) for polluting substances. Member States {{have to set}} {{objectives for}} individual surface water bodies (Article 4 WFD). The transitional period for Directive 2006 / 11 /EC ended in 2013. Therefore, revision, adoption {{and implementation of the}} EQS for the substances on the "Indicative list of main pollutants" (see Annex VIII WFD) is needed to assess the status of the surface waters. In this context, the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) initiated a project to update the environmental quality standards (EQS) for 10 pollutants (pollutants specific for river basin according to Ordinance on the Protection of Surface Waters (OGewV)) and to compile suggestions for environmental quality standards for 20 new chemicals. The searched data were documented data sheets according to the "Guidance Document No. 27 : Technical Guidance for Deriving Environmental Quality Standards" (EC, 2011). The derivation of EQS for the matrices to be considered was performed in accordance with the rules as laid down in the "Guidance Document No. 27 ". Within this project EQS proposals were derived for the following 30 substances: 2. 4 -D, arsenic, bezafibrate, carbamazepin, carbendazim, chloroacetic acid, chromium, dibutyltin, dimethoate, <b>dimoxystrobin,</b> epichlorhydrin, erythromycin, flufenacet, flurtamone, imidacloprid, copper, metoprolol, monobutyltin cation, monolinuron, nicosulfuron, omethoate, triphenyl phosphate, phoxim, roxithromycin, sulcotrione, sulfamethoxazole, tetrabutyltin, triclosan, uranium, zinc...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{pesticides}} in crop fields may have negative effects on soil Oligochaeta Annelida, i. e., earthworms and enchytraeids, and thus affect soil quality. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effects of two commercial fungicide formulations on the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa and the enchytraeid Enchytraeus albidus in a natural soil. The fungicides were Cuprafor micro® (copper oxychloride), commonly used in organic farming, and Swing Gold® (epoxiconazole and <b>dimoxystrobin),</b> a synthetic fungicide widely used in conventional farming to protect cereal crops. Laboratory experiments were used to assess the survival, biomass loss and avoidance behaviour. No lethal effect was observed following exposure to the copper fungicide for 14 days, even at 5000 mg kg− 1 of copper, i. e. 650 times the recommended dose (RD). However, a significant decrease in biomass was observed from 50 mg kg− 1 of copper (6. 5 times the RD) for A. caliginosa and at 5000 mg kg− 1 of copper (650 times the RD) for E. albidus. These sublethal effects suggest that a longer period of exposure would probably have led to lethal effects. The EC 50 avoidance for the copper fungicide was estimated to be 51. 2 mg kg− 1 of copper (6. 7 times the RD) for A. caliginosa, and 393 mg kg− 1 of copper (51 times the RD) for E. albidus. For the Swing Gold® fungicide, the estimated LC 50 was 7. 0 10 − 3 mL kg− 1 (6. 3 times the RD) for A. caliginosa and 12. 7 10 − 3 mL kg− 1 (11. 0 times the RD) for E. albidus. No effect on biomass or avoidance was observed at sublethal concentrations of this synthetic fungicide. It was concluded that enchytraeids were less sensitive than earthworms to the two commercial fungicides in terms of mortality, biomass loss and avoidance behaviour. Therefore we discuss the different strategies possibly used by the two Oligochaeta species to cope with the presence of the pesticides were discussed, along with the potential consequences on the soil functions...|$|E
