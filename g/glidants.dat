40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. The primary {{prerequisites}} for powder mixtures/granules intended for tableting is to posses {{the quality of}} (i) homogenous composition; (ii) acceptable flowability, (iii) sufficient compressibility; and (iv) anti-adhesiveness. The most important prerequisite for these powder mixture/granulates is undoubtedly the ability to flow, due to its effect on product quality, especially dose and dosage form uniformity. A comprehensive literature study on the flowability of powders revealed that flow is affected by physical properties such as molecular- and interparticle forces, particle size and size distribution, particle shape, particle density, surface structure of the particle, and particle packing geometry. Various flow tests are available to determine powder flow, each measuring a variety of the properties mentioned above, resulting in different flow results and a subsequent variation in the classification of powders. Particle characterization {{of a wide range}} of pharmaceutical fillers through SEM and particle size analysis, indicated considerable differences between physical properties of the various fillers, which suggested significant differences in their flow behaviour. Flow tests were conducted determining the critical orifice diameter (COD); percentage compressibility (%C); angle of repose (AoR) and flow rate (FR) of the fillers in the absence and presence of a <b>glidant</b> (0. 25 % Aerosil® 200). The results confirmed the expected differences in flow obtained from the various tests, with no one of the fillers achieving the same flow behaviour in all the tests. The difference in flow amongst the fillers for a specific test could, to a large extent, been correlated with specific physical properties of the particles within the powder bed. COD results illustrated the influence of particle size and shape and surface structure on the flowability of these materials, with fillers with a smaller average particle size, less spherical shaped particles and uneven / rough surface structures performing poorer than their counterparts. The percentage compressibility (%C) of the materials was affected by the shape and size of the particles and the density of the materials, whilst the packing geometry also affected flow behaviour. Particles with high density and a low internal porosity tended to posses free flowing properties. Powders with a larger difference in the ratio between their respective bulk and tapped densities/volumes presented better flow results. The AoR of the fillers was affected by the cohesiveness and friction between the particles as well as the shape, surface structure and size of the particles. This method was less discriminative in terms of indicating differences in the flow of powders with comparable physical properties. A further drawback of this method was the variation in results between repetitions, which is affected by the way the samples were handled prior to measurement. The flow rate (FR) of the fillers was predominantly affected by the density of the materials and the size, shape, and surface structure of the particles. Powders with a higher density seemed to exhibit a better flow rate, although some of the other factors affected the flow rate more when the densities were very close or identical. The following general rank order for the various fillers (as an average of their performance in all the tests) were established (with no <b>glidant</b> present) : Cellactose® 80 > FlowLac® 100 > Prosolv® HD 90 * Ludipress® > Emcompress® >Avicel® PH 200 > Starlac® » Emcocel® 50 M * chitosan » lactose monohydrate. Addition of a <b>glidant</b> failed to change the rank order significantly. During the final stage of the study an attempt was made to modify and/or refine the composite flow index (CFI) proposed by Taylor ef a/. (2000 : 6) through (i) inclusion of flow rate results in its computation and/or (ii) varying the contribution (percentage) of each test to the CFI (Taylor & co-workers used equal contributions, namely 33 V* %, in their calculation of the CFI). The results indicated that including the results from the flow rate test was not beneficial in terms of providing a more representative CFI (in fact it reduced the accuracy of the index). Next various weight ratios for COD, %C and AoR was used to determine the CFI of each filler, and an optimum ratio was found at 50 %: 40 %: 10 % (COD:%C:AoR) resulting in the highest CFI for each powder and the widest range for the CFI (largest difference between minimum and maximum values). This ratio was found in the presence and absence of a <b>glidant.</b> At this ratio the CFI discriminated well between the different powders in terms of their flowability. Lastly, the flowability scale for powders as used by the USP (20007 : 644) for %C and AoR results was adapted and fitted on the CFI results obtained for the various powders. This scale provided an exceptional fit for the powders both in the absence and presence of a <b>glidant)</b> and offered an excellent means for the grouping and classifcation of powders based on their CFI.

40|$|Chitosan is a polymer {{derived from}} chitin that is widely {{available}} at relatively low cost, {{but due to}} compression challenges it has limited application {{for the production of}} direct compression tablets. The aim {{of this study was to}} use certain process and formulation variables to improve manufacturing of tablets containing chitosan as bulking agent. Chitosan particle size and flow properties were determined, which included bulk density, tapped density, compressibility and moisture uptake. The effect of process variables (i. e. compression force, punch depth, percentage compaction in a novel double fill compression process) and formulation variables (i. e. type of glidant, citric acid, pectin, coating with Eudragit S®) on chitosan tablet performance (i. e. mass variation, tensile strength, dissolution) was investigated. Moisture content of the chitosan powder, particle size and the inclusion of <b>glidants</b> had a pronounced effect on its flow ability. Varying the percentage compaction during the first cycle of a double fill compression process produced chitosan tablets with more acceptable tensile strength and dissolution rate properties.

The tablets were evaluated for their various pre-compression, compression characteristics, in vitro drug release kinetics and stability studies. The analytical estimation of drugs {{was found to}} be accurate and precise. The results of rheological characteristics indicated that, the powder beds of both core formulations of PP are freely flowable and easily compressible. Acryl EZE coating over the core tablets protects PP from GI fluids and helps in release of drug in intestinal pH. These studies on coat granules indicated that, the granule beds of all the coat formulations of CA are easily compressible and that flow increases with the addition of <b>glidants.</b> The release rate of CA from HPMC K 4 M formulations is majorly by burst effect, since HPMCK 4 M (p< 0. 05) is relatively more hydrophilic and when swells it forms weaker gel. Also, the release of CA from guar gum and xanthan gum formulations follows zero order release (p< 0. 05). The guar gum when it swells forms thicker gels hence the release rate ‘k’ is small of the three diluents. Stability studies at 40 °C / 75 % RH indicated that there is no significant change in CA content for a period of 3 months.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 In some {{diseases}} it {{is preferable}} that the drugs {{used in their}} treatment are released in the colon. The colon is also suitable for systemic delivery {{of a variety of}} drugs. A variety of systems have been developed for the purpose of achieving colonic targeting. These approaches are either drug-specific (prodrugs) or formulation specific (coated or matrix preparations) and depends on the pH, transit time and pressure or bacteria in the colon. Different polymers, like chitosan, have been evaluated for their susceptibility to degradation by these bacterial enzymes. Chitosan is considered a good candidate for bacterial degradation and is widely available at low cost and has favourable biological properties. To investigate the influence of formulation factors on the properties of chitosan minitablets, it was necessary to ensure that the chitosan had satisfactory powder flow characteristics to ensure uniform compression in the tablet press and to prevent unacceptable variation in the tablet properties such as weight, thickness, disintegration and strength. Moisture content of the powder, particle size and the inclusion of <b>glidants</b> had an effect on the flowability and it could be improved from a composite flow index value of 32. 7 to a value of 58. 8. The compressibility of chitosan is very poor and different factors that might influence it, was investigated. Compression forces of between 15 and 20 bar resulted in tablets with acceptable physical characteristics. An increase in moisture content, using the powder fraction > 212 ym as well as a decrease in powder weight resulted in tablets with a higher tensile strength. Lower compression forces resulted in tablets that are extremely porous. This suggests that the chitosan can only be compressed at high compression forces which are difficult to obtain using a standard tablet press. The standard tablet press was therefore modified to fill more powder in the die and generate higher compression forces. Minitablets were compressed and the dissolution of isoniazide from these tablets was investigated. Varying the punch depth or the compaction of the powder did not result in the desired slower release of the drug as a result. The porosity of the tablets compressed at all the punch depth settings and compaction percentages was probably too high to {{have an effect on the}} wettablity of the tablets and as a result on the dissolution of the isoniazide from the tablets. The inclusion of excipients such as citric acid (an organic acid which would lower the pH in the tablet, allowing the chitosan to form a gel) and pectin (which would form an insoluble complex with the chitosan) into the formulation delayed the dissolution of the isoniazide from the minitablets. Coating of the minitablets with an enteric coating (Eudragit S ®) initially delayed the dissolution of the isoniazide and would protect the tablets from the harsh environment of the stomach so that the tablets will reach the colon and release the drug.

40|$|Talc is {{extensively}} {{used in a}} {{wide variety}} of cosmetic products, particularly in powder products. Talc keeps the skin feeling smooth and dry. Talc in the pharmaceutical industry is used as a glidant and lubricant. <b>Glidants</b> such as talc improve flow properties of powder by decreasing interparticulate friction, by decreasing van der Waals forces and electrostatic charges, by changing particle size distribution, and by decreasing the effect of humidity on surfaces of host particles by forming a mechanical barrier. The loosely bound lattice layers slide over each other and form roller structures which explains its lubrication characteristics. Talc has less deleterious effect compared to magnesium stearate on tablet in vitro properties. Talcs from different size grades were evaluated for their use in direct compression tablet formulations. Lubricant efficiencies of talcs were measured using ejection force values. The Supra grade of the Cyprus Industrial Mineral company talc was found to be most efficient of the grades tested as lubricant and also gave tablets of more acceptable in vitro properties than tablets lubricated with magnesium stearate only. Additionally talcs in substantial percentages were evaluated for their potential as a direct compression matrix material. With commonly used excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose and lactose, the formulations were self lubricating and the tablets ejected easily. Tablets with very low friability, high crushing strength, rapid dissolution rates, good weight uniformity, content uniformity and potency of drugs were obtained. At similar compression forces, tablet hardness with the 300 grade of Alabama, Altac, and Beaverwhite talcs were significantly greater than corresponding 400 and 500 grades. An optimum direct compression tablet formulation of a conventional theophylline tablet was achieved using the technique of response surface methodology and successive quadratic programming (SQP). The response surfaces were obtained from a second order uniform precision hexagonal design. The tablet formulation was optimized for mean in vitro dissolution time using friability, hardness, ejection force and disintegration time as constraints within the experimental region by the SQP algorithm. The response surface model was validated by preparing and evaluating the predicted formulation. The characteristics of the tablet formulation were analyzed by principal component analysis. Sensitivity analysis of optimal solution was performed for each constraint, while all remaining constraints were held constant. The robustness of the response surface model was evaluated by simulation for error in the compression force values due to its inherent variation. Although pharmaceutical scientists have previously reported optimization studies, the approach used in this thesis has significant advantages and have not apparently been previously used or the optimization of pharmaceutical formulation. A completely novel use for talc as a major matrix component in direct compression tablet formulation, has been proposed and examined. A robust and efficient response surface experimental design and mathematical optimization technique has been evaluated for application to the pharmaceutical sciences. The computer search method has the disadvantage of frequently giving a plural solution for suitable formulations. With the classical Lagrangian method, it can become difficult to solve the resultant set of simultaneous equations especially for nonlinear problems. The SQP method is more efficient and robust compared to previously published optimization techniques including SUMT (Successive Unconstrained Minimization Technique).

40|$|The direct {{application}} of fluid system approaches to granular materials oftentimes leads to spectacular failures, e. g. two miscible fluids shaken {{in a container}} rapidly become an homogeneous mixture, while vibrating a device containing two kinds of powders result in extreme segregation. Nevertheless, much can be learned through analogies between these disparate systems. The approach taken in this work {{is to focus on}} adapting concepts from fluid behavior and explore their application in relevant industrial processes involving granular materials [...] -such as mixing/segregation, heat transfer and flowability. We use Particle Dynamics (PD) [...] -a Discrete Element Method [...] -to model transport and flow of granular materials. Adhesion, for example, is commonly found in operations involving fine powders where van der Waals forces start to play an important role. Our PD model, which is capable of simulating dry adhesive interactions, is used to study mixing/segregation. By introducing a characterization tool [...] -the van der Waals Granular Bond Number [...] -the asymptotic mixed/segregated state of the system is analytically predicted. These predictions are most easily summarized by phase-space diagrams which exhibit both mixed and segregated regions. The phase-space diagrams are computationally tested (with PD) by selecting granular materials of different properties so that we explore both mixed and segregated regions. Each of these materials is allowed to reach its asymptotic state in a mixing drum, and this final state is compared to the predictions. Beyond predicting the asymptotic state of a system, the next natural step is to explore the possibility of controlling it. With this purpose, we propose the addition of ``helper" particles that can either promote mixing or segregation. These amphiphilic helper particles [...] -also called Janus particles [...] -act as bridges between the base (non-helper) particles, alternatively promoting mixing in a system that would otherwise segregate (surfactant helpers) or separating a specific kind of particle from a mixture (extractant helpers). Phase space diagrams summarizing these trends are analytically built by comparing the interaction forces in the system: the final state of the system is determined by the interactions that predominate. Again, the predictions are then tested against results obtained by PD simulations of the system including Janus particles, which are further compared to the binary adhesive system that contain no helper particles. The presence of adhesive forces in granular materials can also affect the flowability of a granular material. <b>Glidants</b> [...] -also known as flow aids or conditioners [...] -are frequently added to dry cohesive powders to improve their flow properties and to facilitate their handling. These aids can reduce the inter-particle forces by imposing a physical barrier between host particles but are often identified on a trial-and-error or ad hoc basis. Using our PD model and characterization tools, glidant particles are engineered to improve the flowability properties of a dry cohesive powder. Finally, heat transfer within granular materials is studied by observing the dominant heat transfer mechanisms in the granular bed. Specifically, we examine the conditions necessary to achieve conduction-dominated versus convection-dominated heat transfer and introduce a granular analog of the Peclet number as a means of quantifying the transition. Our experiments consist of PD simulations of rotating tumblers where the granular material is being heated from the walls. When conduction is the dominant mechanism, increasing the mixing rate seems to have a positive impact in the rate of heat transfer; however, under convection-dominated conditions the opposite is often true. In order to further clarify the role of inter-particle mixing, the temperature profiles of the material in the drums are compared to a continuum model for mixing of cohesionless granular materials. Similarities between these two {{are most likely to be}} found when convection is the mechanism that dominates the heat transport. Dimensionless numbers are used to correlate the results obtained for multiple systems and surprising degree of similarity is found when compared to analogous fluid correlations...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Chitosan, {{derived from}} the most {{abundant}} natural polymer available next to cellulose, lacks the micrometric properties a pharmaceutical excipient intended for direct compression has to comprise. Excellent flowability, compactibility and dust freeness are primary micrometric properties required from direct compression excipients to ensure {{the success of the}} method. The successful exploitation of direct compression as a tablet manufacturing process could result in phenomenal time saving and economical benefits. Size enlargement is a technique utilized to alter the micrometric properties of powders on a physical level. Several methods are available to enlarge particle size, but no techniques experimented offered the same advantages in terms of efficiency, simplicity, time and cost effectiveness than the spherical agglomeration technique. An intensive preliminary experimental study revealed the predominant factors contributing to the successful spherical agglomeration of chitosan. A factorial design identified the optimum factors and factor levels. An agitation speed of 400 rpm provided agglomerates of desirable size and shape. Higher speeds disrupted the process. A suspension agglomeration time of 15 minutes produced perfectly spherical agglomerates, but had no influence on tablet properties. A bridging liquid volume of 3 ml per 3 g powder was sufficient to wet the suspended particles. Higher volumes per powder weight produced large undesirable agglomerates which failed during compression. A bridging liquid concentration of 5 % v/v facilitated adequate wetting. The optimum binder was identified as ~ o l l i d o nK~ 25 and a binder concentration of 30 % w/w seemed adequate to coat the entire powder mass, as SEM micrographs indicated. The optimal parameters and levels of the spherical agglomeration of chitosan were recognized and further investigated. A study on the effect of each variable level was conducted in an attempt to explore the influence of a factor level on spherical chitosan agglomerate recovery and formation. Results indicated that no trends were present and that it could be suggested that agglomerate recovery {{was the result of the}} interaction of certain factors and specific factor levels. Spherically agglomerated chitosan possessed phenomenally enhanced flow, compressibility and dust free properties. An angle of repose test indicated an improvement in fluidity from 23. 2 ' to 2. 5 '. No lamination during compression was encountered. Spherically agglomerated chitosan was compressed successfully and used in tablet formulations without any tableting excipients other than ~ o l l i d o nK~ 2 5, an excipient that proved essential in the agglomeration step. No <b>glidants</b> were necessary, as the powder flowed freely into the tablet die. In addition, the formulations required no lubrication in view of the fact that the tablets underwent no friction during compression. The tablets were hard (>lo 0 Newton), and had minimum friability and complied with the weight variation standards of the British Pharmacopoeia. Propranolol hydrochloride is an extremely poor flowing powder and could only be compressed with chitosan after being spherically agglomerated with chitosan. The drug remained stable during and after spherical agglomeration. The process proved safe, given the results obtained from the X-ray powder diffraction and infrared absorption spectroscopy. Dissolution parameters in 0. 1 M HCI and Sorensen buffer pH 4. 5 were tested. The InderalB LA 80 mg was the norm (1. 000). Formulation 1 presented an average (DR,), of 1. 42 and a (AUC), + (DR,), (combined) of 3. 52. Formulation 2 displayed an average (AUC), of 2. 05. Formulation 3 had the overall best dissolution performance compared to InderalB LA 80 mg, with an f 2 -value in both mediums of 34. 46. Formulation 1 had an f 2 -value in 0. 1 M HCI of 51. 45, an (AUC), of 1. 30 and a (DR,), of 1. 46. The initial dissolution rate decreased with an increase in crushing strength and concentration propranolol and chitosan per tablet formulation. The incorporation of spherically agglomerates of chitosan into tablets resulted in sustained release of the drug. It can be concluded that the release of propranolol from spherically agglomerated chitosan tablets is in accordance with the matrix model where diffusion is the rate limiting factor, with an almost desirable linear dependency for zero order drug release. A linear correlation is present between the percentage of drug released and the square root of time (R 2 = 0. 9434). Additionally, a linear relationship was found between the logarithm of the amount of drug released and the logarithm of time (R 2 = 0. 9172). With a slope of 0. 6594, it can be concluded that drug release took place passing through a porous system and as a result of a combination of diffusion through a polymer and diffusion through pores in the system. The suitability of chitosan as a multipurpose excipient was illustratpd.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} processes for producing unit dose medication is the compaction of pharmaceutical powder mixtures into tablets. The acceptability of tablets formulations in the marketplace will be primarily determined by patient acceptance {{in a class of}} equal therapeutic value. Therefore appropriate selection and use of components that impact on these properties are of extreme importance. However, the pharmaceutical excipients are required to comply with pharmacotechnical aptness and regulatory qualifications desired and implemented for the purpose. Any potential formulation must have to be financial viable simultaneously for business competiveness. In this connection, granules fabricated with processed watermelon flesh as novelmultifunctional pharmaceutical excipient for tablet compression have been evaluated for the pharmaceutical and micromeritic properties towards their potential use in manufacturing of compressed tablets with identified trade merits. Evaluation of granules was performed using drug content particle size analysis, angle of repose, bulk and tapped density measurement, compressibility index, hausner's ratio and water treatment. The particle size distribution was a normal distribution in all the batches. The angle of repose of all batches depicts excellent flow of powder with added <b>glidant</b> which was further supported by compressibility Index and Hausner's ratio.

40|$|In {{pharmaceutical}} technology one {{is often}} engaged {{with the design}} and analysis of formulations. A formulation of a solid dosage form is normally a mixture of components. This formulation usually consists {{of a number of}} components with fixed concentrations like the the medicinal substance(s) (drug), the lubricant, the <b>glidant,</b> possibly the disintegrant and components with variable concentrations like the fillerbinders. In the case of tablets, several physical demands can be set to the formulation like having certain (minimum or maximum) values for the crushing strength, the disintegration time, the friability, the weight variation, content uniformity, etc. The desired properties should be reached by changing the concentrations of the filler-binders, sometimes the disintegrant and/or by changing the manufacturing conditions. Another important property of a formulation is to keep the desired values of the physical demands as constant as possible during production or shelf-life despite (small) variations in the manufacturing conditions or in the concentrations of the components. In other words the fomulation should ideally be robust against the mentioned sources of error or a certain quality level should be maintained. This thesis considers only the mixture optimization part (changing filler-binderldisintegrant concentrations) of the formulation optimization and robustness against errors in the mixture concentration settings. ...|$|R
40|$|Challenges facing {{pharmaceutical}} efforts {{aimed at}} utilization of medicinal plants as formulated dosage forms are: formulation of an effective, safe, elegant and stable dosage form {{to be used}} by an appropriate route of administration at a suitable dose and frequency of administration to give the required therapeutic activity for the proper period of time, without or with minimal side or toxic effects. A questionnaire was used to investigate the practice of house-hold usage of medicinal herbs, and the data collected indicated that the herb most commonly used as an antispasmodic remedy was Solenostemma argel(48 %) among another four medicinal plants. Botanical and phytochemical experiments were carried out for the identification and classification of the herb as well as extraction, separation and identification of the main constituents of S. argelleaves. They included general identity tests of S. argel leaves, e. g. the macroscopical, microscopical, macro-chemical analysis, thin layer chromatography and column analysis for the presence of characteristic alkaloids and flavonoids. Detection, separation, and isolation of flavonoids involved the use of silica gel columns eluted with different solvent systems. Alkaloids were extracted from S. argelhomogenised leaves in a soxlet with different solvent systems. The identification tests confirmed the presence of both alkaloids and flavonoids in these extracts. Phytochemical experiments also included detection, separation and identification of flavonoid compounds in water or methanol extracts of S. argelby using paper chromatography or thin layer chromatography, silica gel, run in B:A:W system. The chromatograms were sprayed with natural substances reagent or ninhydrin. Separation of different flavonoid compounds was carried out by using an accelerated eluted solvent passage through a polyamide chromatographic column using different solvent systems, and these portions were examined for their pharmacological effects. Microbiological quality control of Solenostemma argelleaves powders and preparations showed that these products were negative for Escherichia coliand Salmonella spp., and their levels of contamination did not exceed 200 cfu/g. Pharmacological and toxicological experiments were conducted for verification and confirmation of the biological activities of the powder, extracts, and alkaloids of S. argel on different experimental models, and authentication of the effectiveness of S. argel preparations. They included using different experimental animal models, and this was followed by other experiments for further investigation of the possible toxic effects of S. argelpreparations, in different dosage regimens, to ascertain the safety of these S. argelproducts. Solenostemma argelextract showed inhibitory effects upon the spontaneous as well as induced contractions produced by acetylcholine (1 µg/ml) or barium chloride (0. 002 mg/ml) in contracting rabbit small intestine model or guinea pig small intestine model, and the degrees of relaxation were compared with those produced by reference drugs such as hyoscine or papaverine. Other experimental models including isolated rabbit heart and intact African toad heart showed the depressant effects on the myocardium of different S. argelextracts, perfused continuously, and reduction of the heart rate and stroke. The local anaesthetic effects of S. argelextracts were studied on African toad’s foot withdrawal reflex and compared with those of lignocaine, kaempferol, quercetin and rutin. The relative potency of S. argelalkaloids was 50 % of that of lignocaine and equivalent to that of kaempferol. Solenostemma argelalkaloids diffusion across rabbit small intestine was studied before and after the addition of 0. 01 g of sodium fluoride. This revealed the inhibitory effects (70 - 90 %) of sodium fluoride on S. argelalkaloids diffusion rate across the rabbit small intestine, and indicated involvement of an active transport mechanism. X Median effective doses (ED 50) of S. argelalkaloids (0. 275 mg) and hyoscine (0. 035 mg) were calculated by the MedUSA system used to compare their antispasmodic effects by recording the inhibitory effects of these two drugs on acetylcholine-induced contraction of guinea pig ileum model. The activity of hyoscine was eight times that of S. argelalkaloids. Toxicological investigations included evaluation of acute toxicity of S. argelby determination of lethal doses of S. argel in four Albino Canadian rats and four local species rabbits. The mean lethal dose was 6. 35 g/kg for the rabbits and 5. 49 g/kg for the rats (n= 4)). The median lethal dose, (LD 50), of S. argelalkaloids was determined in sixty Albino rats assigned to six groups of ten animals each. Starting from the lethal dose of 5. 49 g/kg, each group was given a different intra-peritoneal injection of: 25 %, 37. 5 %, 50 %, 75 %, 87. 5 %, or 100 % of the lethal dose, and the log dose was plotted versus the mean deaths; the LD 50 obtained from the graph was 5. 0 g/kg in Albino rats. Evaluation of acute toxicity of S. argelwas carried out in a group of seven young Nubian goats and compared with the control group. Individual animals in the test group were given a 5 g/kg dose of S. argelsyrup once daily for 45 days, and the animals were sacrificed and investigations carried out revealed: no significant (P< 0. 05) changes in the weight of the vital organs; but their histopathological examination revealed some tissue abnormalities including: congested heart; hyperaemia of the intestinal tissues and catarrhal inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration; liver tissue necrosis of centrilobular hepatocytes and fatty cytoplasm vacuolation; kidney tissue necrosis of renal tubules and interstitial mononuclear cells infiltration. There were changes in serum concentrations of urea, inorganic phosphorus, creatinine, calcium, total protein and albumin; alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase had high levels. RBCs count, MCV and PCV were higher in treated animals compared to normal goats. Similar studies of toxic effects of S. argelalkaloids were conducted in white Albino Canadian rats, without significant changes occurring in their vital organs, but there were significant increases in urea, creatinine, calcium, phosphorous, alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase. Phosphorus, creatinine, calcium, total protein, albumin concentrations, as well as alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase activities were at high levels in animals given high dose of 0. 63 gm/kg of S. argel alkaloids. Changes in haematological parameters included decreases in haemoglobin and packed cell volume with the maximum dose of 640 mg/kg and the effective dose of 160 mg/kg, while there was an increase with the median effective dose of 320 mg/kg. Solenostemma argelleaves preparations were designed and formulated in tablets as an oral dosage form similar to its oral use in folkloric medicine. Tablets were selected as a dosage form because of their several advantages including: improved dosage accuracy and reliable delivery of the drug; ease of their preparation, evaluation, control, storage, and dispensing; convenience of use and compliance of patients; their inherently higher chemical stability and their rapid mass production, and are the least expensive of the solid dosage forms. Pharmaceutical experiments included optimization of physicochemical characters of S. argeltablets prepared from the powdered leaves, extracts or alkaloids {{in a wide range of}} pharmaceutical formulations with different types and concentrations of diluents, binders and disintegrants, in addition to optimization of drug particle size and process conditions, such as the state and time of binder or disintegrant additions. The optimized formulations were subjected to a wide range of quality control tests including physical and chemical parameters, particularly hardness, friability, disintegration and dissolution, and hence affecting drug release, bioavailability, absorption and therapeutic activity. Solenostemma argelleaves were powdered using a hammer mill to a particle size and distribution that would flow freely. Sieve analysis and separation of S. argelleaves powder, applicable to particles in the size range of ≤ 160 to ≥ 250 microns, was used XI both as a method of particle size analysis and separation of powder into various sizes ranges, in order to produce materials within a specified range, and screen out very fine particles or over-size materials. The amount of powder that passed through the 160 -micron mesh was found to be 63 %, and this fraction of powdered S. argel leaves was mainly used in the formulation of optimized S. argeltablets. Preparation of the granules of different formulae involved preparation and use of various binders. The wet masses of different formulations were forced through a No. 12 -mesh screen manually in the case of small batches, or by using Erweka granulating machine with large batches. The prepared granules were dried in a hot air oven at 50 °C overnight, and the dried granules were sized by passing through a No. 14 -mesh screen, to facilitate the granules flow and compressibility. Following granules sizing, the granules were mixed with the other formulation ingredients, such disintegrants, lubricants and <b>glidants,</b> and compressed into tablets using a single-punch tableting machine. Different formulae of S. argel tablets were prepared by compressing unit volumes equivalent to 500 mg of the granulation or leaves powders and 250 mg of the granulation in the case of the dried extracts or alkaloids of S. argel. From these optimization trials, it was concluded that: a) a combination of binding agents was needed and a reduction of binder concentration was a must to optimize these formulae; and b) the use of a disintegrating agent, before and after granulation, in S. argelleaves tablets also optimized these formulae. Stability experiments were included investigation and determination of the possible effects of different storage conditions, including on-going stability conditions and accelerated stability conditions, on the physicochemical properties of optimized S. argel tablets. In quality assurance studies, stability is defined as the extent to which a product retains, within specified limits, and through its period of storage and use, i. e. its shelflife, the same properties and characteristics that it possessed at the time of its manufacture. Accelerated stability testing are studies designed to increase the rate of chemical degradation and physical change of drug by using exaggerated storage conditions; they should be used consistentlythroughout a particular stability study. These stability tests were carried out by placing 100 tablets of each formula at room temperature at 30 o C± 15 o C and RH 60 %± 15 %; in an incubator at 37 o C± 2 o C and RH 70 %± 5 %; and in another incubator at 50 °C± 5 °C and RH 70 %± 5 %, for intervals extending from 6 months to 48 months. Evaluation of the physicochemical properties was done at zero time, and at the specified time intervals. The results were tabulated for each formula. Physicochemical characters and properties changes evaluated included: uniformity of weight, diameter, thickness, microbial growth, tablet hardness, friability, disintegration time, dissolution rate of tablet constituents, powder contents estimation with time, and mottling, capping, and lamination. In certain formulae of the tested tablets, there were changes in the hardness, odour, friability and powder contents. Questionnaire (II) was used to evaluate the practice of using herbal medicines as antispasmodic remedy, and revealed the effectiveness of the medicinal herbs used, with 60 % of the participants feeling completely relieved of pain after a single administration of the medicinal herb, and 26 % used the drug several times due to repeated attacks of pain. With regard to the types of herbal preparations used, 45 % used decoctions, 38 % used powder type, and 17 % used macerated plants preparations. Clinical investigations included evaluation of safety and efficacy of Solenostemma argel tablets, and determination of any possible side effects, adverse reactions or toxic manifestations at therapeutic dosage regimen in ten healthy male volunteers. This was followed by evaluation of therapeutic effectiveness and side effects of S. argeltablets in a group of hundred patients with different clinical complains mainly gastro-intestinal tract colics, or urinogenital tract spasms and menstrual pain. None of these subjects, healthy or patient, complained of any serious side effects or toxic reactions. XII Ten healthy male subjects participated in these clinical trials after signing a written consent, and were subjected to a medical examination and follow up by a clinician. The trials were started with low doses, e. g. one tablet three times daily, and gradually increased till the highest dose of four tablets three times a day for each of the leaves, extracts or alkaloids tablets was attained. The volunteers were monitored for the occurrence of any side effects or adverse reactions. None of the volunteers complained of blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, tachycardia or bradycardia, palpitation, headache or vomiting during the period of the trial. Only one of these subjects complained of dryness of the mouth and another subject complained of stomach upset felt at the time of administration ofSolenostemma argelleaves tablets. The clinical trials were organized in three teaching hospitals under the supervision of four clinicians. Randomly selected 100 patients, 20 - 70 years old and 40 males and 60 females, were complaining of abdominal disturbances, and diagnosed as having gastritis, indigestion, heartburn, flatulence, irritable bowel syndrome, renal colics, or colics due to menstrual pain. These patients were treated by using two tablets of Solenostemma argelleaves or extracts administered when necessary. They were followed up for therapeutic effectiveness of the administered tablets as indicated by the relief of pain and colics, and monitored for occurrence of side effects or adverse reactions. When necessary, another two-tablet dose was administered to patients when there was recurrence of pain or colics. The general observation in treatment of gastrointestinal disturbances with Solenostemma argeltablets was the quick suppression of symptoms and relief of pain occurring immediately following drug administration. However, in the case of renal colics, pain associated with menstrual disturbances, and irritable bowel syndrome, IBS, there might be a need for repetition of the treatment. In most cases, the pain was relieved without any pronounced side effects or adverse reactions. Different types of Solenostemma argeltablets showed a very good therapeutic effectiveness (71 %- 100 %), and a great margin of safety (98 %- 100 %). Forty patients with diagnosed irritable bowel syndrome were treated with placebo tablets (5 % pain relief), generic antispasmodic tablets (90 %), and Solenostemma argel leaves (71 %) or extract (88 %) tablets. Solenostemma argelextract tablets had a quicker onset of action and were more effective than the equivalent leaves tablets. No side effects were recorded with extract tablets, but in two patients mild stomach upset was recorded with leaves tablets. Accordingly, Solenostemma argeltablets, especially those of the extract or alkaloid, would be useful in relieving IBS associated pain by administering two tablets half an hour before meals. Success of the present project and implementation of its findings may pave the way for other projects to be designed and conducted for further utilization of other useful medicinal plants used in folkloric practices...|$|E

An experimental Box-Behnken design was applied to assure high quality of the OD-mini-tablets and reduce product variability. The design was employed to understand {{the influence of the}} critical excipient combinations on the production of OD-mini-tablets and thus guarantee the feasibility of obtaining products with dosage form uniformity. The variables selected were mannitol percent in Avicel (X 1), swelling pressure of the superdisintegrant (X 2), and the surface area of Aerosil as a <b>glidant</b> (X 3). Risperidone-excipient compatibilities were investigated using FTIR and the spectra did not display any interaction. Fifteen formulations were prepared and evaluated for pre- and post-compression characteristics. The prepared OD-mini-tablet batches were also assessed for disintegration in simulated salivary fluid (SSF, pH 6. 2) and in reconstituted skimmed milk. The optimized formula fulfilled the requirements for crushing strength of 5 kN with minimal friability, disintegration times of 8. 4 and 53. 7 s in SSF and skimmed milk, respectively.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharm.)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. The {{most widely}} used {{lubricant}} in the pharmaceutical industry is probably magnesium stearate. Magnesium stearate exhibits its lubricating properties by forming a film of low shear strength between the die wall and the compact, thus reducing the friction (Banker & Anderson, 1986 : 306). It also exhibits anti-adhesive and flow enhancement properties by preventing tablets from sticking to the die wall and punch faces and ensuring uniformity of tablets. Besides these advantageous properties, the lubricant forms a hydrophobic film around the carrier particles which can negatively affect the tablet properties such as crushing strength, disintegration time, friability and dissolution (Bolhuis et al., 1975 : 324; Levy & Gumtow, 1963 : 1142). Due to the deleterious effects on the tablet properties, lubricant concentrations must be restricted to an absolute minimum. These effects are known to increase with prolonged mixing, and in practice one tries to keep the lubricant mixing time as short as possible (Ragnarsson et al., 1979 : 130). It {{has been shown that}} the die wall film of magnesium stearate is resistant to wearing off and the lubricating effect remains for several compactions when an unlubricated granulation is added to a lubricated die (Holzer & Sjogren, 1981 b: 276). The lubricant film around the particles is formed during the final mixing, while the film at the die wall is formed during the compaction. This implicates that the lubricant is mixed for shorter (mixing) times with the other excipients in the formulation. Sodium stearyl fumarate (Pruv®) has been suggested as a suitable lubricant in tableting (Mendell, 2002 : 5) and it is claimed not to have the disadvantages of magnesium stearate in respect of tablet strength, disintegration and dissolution (Lindberg, 1972 : 213). These properties could prove advantageous regarding tablet strength as well as drug release properties (especially for immediate release tablet formulations). Since the primary function of lubricants is the reduction of friction, it was this property that provided the challenge that was circumvented in this study. The addition of the sparingly water-soluble, hydrophobic drug, furosemide, perplexed the formulation of tablets, however, provided a mode of evaluation of the effects of formulation variables on tracer substance dissolution behaviour. Systematic evaluations of various commercially available excipients were investigated to determine their effects on the physical tablet properties as well as on tracer dissolution. Magnesium stearate or Pruv® was incorporated into Avicel® PH- 200, Emcompress® and Tablettose® fillers/binders. Mixing time was varied between 1 and 16 minutes and mixing speed between 33 and 97 rpm under certain specified testing environments in a Turbula® mixer. Compression was done with a Manesty® F 3 single station tablet press with biconcave punches (10 mm). Evaluation on the powder and the compressed formulation was done. The aim was to evaluate and compare the lubricant, <b>glidant</b> and antiadherent properties of magnesium stearate and Pruv®, as well as the effect both had on tablet properties (crushing strength, friability and disintegration) and drug release. It was found that magnesium stearate had superior <b>glidant</b> properties compared to its counterpart {{as a result of its}} flatter particle shape and larger specific surface area. Lubricant concentrations below 0. 5 % w/w gave optimum glidancy for both lubricants and mixing times between 4 and 8 minutes was sufficient to optimize this <b>glidant</b> effect. Tablet strength decreased when lubricant concentration increased, due to less interparticulate binding surface between the carrier particles. This decrease subsided when lubrication surpassed the 1. 5 % w/w concentration level. Mixing, however, had the opposite effect on Pruv® than on magnesium stearate, since Pruv® increased the tablet strength with continuous mixing. Disintegration and dissolution deteriorated with the addition of magnesium stearate and Pruv®. This was due to the hydrophobic nature of magnesium stearate and increase in tablet strength observed with Pruv®. The evaluation of the extent of drug release (AUC) and rate of release (DR|) indicated of an average increase of 50 % in drug release in formulations with Pruv® compared to magnesium stearate as lubricant. Magnesium stearate had superior lubricant and antiadherent properties as opposed to Pruv® and optimum lubricant efficiency was experienced at low concentrations (< 1 % w/w) and low mixing times (< 4 minutes). The apparatus and methods for lubricant evaluation were newly developed and gave accurate, repeatable measurements. Master...|$|R
