40|$|Overexposure to noise {{remains a}} widespread, serious health hazard in the US mining and other {{industries}} despite 25 years of regulation. Most categories of illnesses and injuries associated with mining have improved, {{with the exception}} of hearing loss. The drilling of rock in a confined work environment contributes to high levels of noise exposure in mining. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is conducting research to reduce the noise exposures of <b>jackleg</b> <b>drill</b> operators and to prevent additional cases of noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) by developing and evaluating low-cost retrofit noise controls for equipment. This report describes the procedure for the measurement and reporting of noise from portable pneumatic tools such as jackleg drills. The technique used in this research allows for the determination of the source A-weighted sound power levels and the radiation patterns in octave and 1 / 3 octave bands. Overall sound power level is also determined. This paper also reports the results obtained by using this procedure to evaluate a SECO S 215 standard production drill and a CSIR Miningtek prototype rock drill incorporating engineering noise control measures. It was found that by using the manufacture 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s recommended operating pressure of 496 kPa (72 psi) that the CSIR prototype 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s sound power was 10 dB(A) less then that of the SECO S 215...|$|E
40|$|In the October 1998 {{issue of}} the Holmes Safety Association Bulletin, NIOSH authors Mark Stephenson and Carol Merry wrote the article Hearing loss among miners and {{measures}} to protect hearing, which focused on the extensiveness of hearing loss among miners {{and the use of}} hearing protection to prevent hearing loss. While the primary importance of engineering controls in preventing hearing loss was discussed, since miners do not generally have control over their work en 2 or assignments, the article focused on the importance of consis 2 use of hearing protection. In this article, all aspects of a compre 2 approach to the prevention of hearing loss in miners will be covered. The discussions will do the following: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 describe application of the hierarchy of controls in preventing hear 2 loss in miners, 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 give an example for each type of control measure and its impact, 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 explain the major provisions, be 2 the hierarchy of controls, of the recent NIOSH document en-titled Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupa 2 Noise Exposure, Revised Criteria 1998 relative to a hearing loss prevention program, and 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 summarize important points on control of noise exposure for every miner to remember, equipment in most facets of operations. Miners are well aware of noisy areas in or around equipment, icluding extraction machinery such as draglines, power shovels, longwall shearers, and continuous mining machines; powered haulage equipment such as load-haul-dumps, shuttle cars, large trucks, and continuous haulage units; roof bolting machines; <b>jackleg</b> <b>drills</b> and stopers; auxiliary equipment such as compressors, fans, and pumps; size reduction equipment, etc. They are not well aware of the insidious nature of pro 2 hearing loss, which is per 2, but they are generally aware of what levels of noise are hazardous and what measures can be taken to reduce their personal noise exposure. Behaviorally, however, there are many reasons why miners choose not to use hearing protection faithfully...|$|R
