5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the <b>day,</b> <b>so</b> that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E
5|$|I., II., and III./KG 55 {{were also}} in action. III./KG 55 bombed Heathrow Airport. Results are unknown and losses are unclear. KG 55 {{suffered}} heavy losses the previous <b>day,</b> <b>so</b> its operations seemed limited. On 12 August it lost 13 Heinkel He 111s and their crews. The next day, 14 August, they would lose their Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Alois Stoeckl.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{there were}} three trains on the Bergen Line in each {{direction}} per <b>day,</b> <b>so</b> only a single locomotive was necessary on the Flåm Line. From 1949 there were two locomotives on the Flåm Line and from 1955 all three were used there. Five passenger cars in aluminum were delivered by Strømmens Værksted. The cost of the three locomotives and five cars was NOK2.4 million.|$|E

Sally blames Peter for it and runs to comfort Liz. Gwen approaches Peter, and the two agree {{they need to have}} a talk with Harry about his belligerent attitude towards them and constant strange behavior.|$|E
5|$|After a year's {{absence from}} {{international}} football due to injury, Overmars was recalled to the Netherlands squad for their friendly against Portugal in April 2003. Two months later, {{he came on}} as a substitute against Belarus in a Euro 2004 qualifier and scored the opening goal of the game. He was selected for the tournament held in Portugal, and was advised by Advocaat not to train {{more than once a}} <b>day,</b> <b>so</b> that his body would resist burn out. Overmars only started three matches in Euro 2004, his final game was the Netherlands loss to Portugal in the semi-final. In all, he played in 86 games for his national side, scoring 17 goals.|$|E
5|$|Booth had {{free access}} to {{all parts of the}} theater as a famous and popular actor who had {{frequently}} performed at Ford's Theatre and who was well known to its owner John T. Ford, even having his mail sent there. He bored a spyhole into the door of the presidential box earlier that <b>day</b> <b>so</b> that he could check that his intended victim had made it to the play and observe the box's occupants.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} April 1917 Hawks {{was working}} on Cecil B. DeMille's The Little American. (On this film he met and befriended the then 18-year-old slate boy James Wong Howe, who was {{to become one of}} Hollywood's most {{significant}} cinematographers.) Hawks then worked on the Mary Pickford film The Little Princess, directed by Marshall Neilan. According to Hawks, Neilan did not show up to work one <b>day,</b> <b>so</b> the resourceful Hawks offered to direct a scene himself, to which Pickford consented.|$|E
5|$|During 18 August 1940, Luftwaffe units flew a {{total of}} 970 sorties over Britain: some 495 by medium bombers, 460 by fighters and 15 by {{reconnaissance}} units. Of this total, about 170 of the bomber sorties were flown {{on the night of}} 17/18 August; the remainder were flown during the daylight hours on 18 August. Less than half of the available (or serviceable) aircraft on the Luftflotte 2 and Luftflotte 3 order of battle were involved in the action that <b>day,</b> <b>so</b> {{it was clear that the}} Luftwaffe was not greatly extended in providing forces for the offensive. Luftflotte 5 did not take any part in the fighting, although its reconnaissance aircraft were active over England and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 2006, the Civic Party, Democratic Party, Harbour-front Enhancement Committee, Hong Kong Institute of Architects, People's Sustainable Development Committee, Clear the Air, and Earth Care jointly met to {{urge the}} public {{to fight for the}} {{preservation}} of the pier. Over 1,000 signatures were collected on that one day alone, in a petition to be submitted to Chief Executive Donald Tsang and other senior officials. In addition, a group of protesters began a peaceful sit-in that <b>day.</b> <b>So</b> Sau Chung, veteran campaigner (now a monk), whose hunger strike against Star Ferry fare increases triggered the riots in 1966, came by to lend his support.|$|E

5|$|On November 22, 1963, Altgens was {{scheduled}} {{to work in the}} AP offices in Dallas as the wirephoto editor. He asked instead to go to the railroad overpass (the bridge under which Elm, Main and Commerce Streets converge at the west end of Dealey Plaza) to photograph the motorcade that was to take President Kennedy from Love Field to his scheduled appearance at the Dallas Trade Mart. Altgens was not assigned to work in the field that <b>day,</b> <b>so</b> he took his personal single-lens reflex camera rather than the motor-driven equipment normally used for news events.|$|E
5|$|Scully awakens the {{following}} <b>day,</b> <b>so</b> Mulder {{is called to}} the hospital and sees her, where she indicates she heard his voice while in her coma and is given her cross necklace. Scully tells him she doesn't remember anything after being kidnapped by Duane Barry. Later Scully asks one of the nurses if she can see Nurse Owens, as she wants to thank her, but the nurse tells Scully that no nurse named Owens works at the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Sunday was a rest <b>day,</b> <b>so</b> {{the match}} resumed on Monday, 10 February. As {{it was a}} working day, the crowd was much smaller. Rain had fallen and the sun had baked the playing surface into a sticky wicket, which caused erratic behaviour. Nat Thomson was out for a duck without {{addition}} to the overnight total, and a collapse ensued. New South Wales made only 49 in their second innings; Bannerman top-scored with 20 while six of his colleagues failed to score, while Emmett and Ulyett took four and five wickets respectively, including four wickets in four balls for the latter. England thus won by an innings and 41 runs.|$|E

5000|$|National also {{charges a}} day for each 4 hours of repair, plus 40% to cover weekends, plus 3 {{administrative}} <b>days,</b> <b>so</b> a 26-hour job is charged as 11.5 days.|$|R
5000|$|A {{solar year}} is about 365 1/4 days, and 12 month is about 354 3/8 <b>days.</b> <b>So</b> the Chinese date move for about 11 days {{backward}} or 19 days forward.|$|R
5|$|The {{satellite}} {{rights of}} the film were sold to Kalaignar TV. The film was initially scheduled for a late 2009 release, but was pushed to 14 January 2010 coinciding with the Tamil harvest festival Thai Pongal. Karthi's second film Aayirathil Oruvan, which was in production for nearly three years, was also planned to release on the same day. According to the Tamil Film Producers Council, two films starring the same actor could not be released on the same <b>day,</b> <b>so</b> Aayirathil Oruvan was given priority, whilst Paiyaa was postponed for 30 days. The release was postponed again for some reasons, before finally hitting the screens on 2 April 2010. The film had its premiere at the Sathyam Cinemas, Chennai.|$|E
5|$|While {{almost all}} jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods, Phaeacius does not use the usual hunting tactics. Most jumping spiders walk {{throughout}} the <b>day,</b> <b>so</b> that they maximise their chances of a catch, and jump on their prey and then bite it. Unlike most jumping spiders, Phaeacius and other spartaeines do not leap on prey, but lunge from about half the predator's body length away.|$|E
5|$|With its {{increasing}} rarity, {{specimens of}} the great auk and its eggs became collectible and highly prized by rich Europeans, {{and the loss of}} a large number of its eggs to collection contributed to the demise of the species. Eggers, individuals who visited the nesting sites {{of the great}} auk to collect their eggs, quickly realized that the birds did not all lay their eggs on the same <b>day,</b> <b>so</b> they could make return visits to the same breeding colony. Eggers only collected the eggs without embryos and typically, discarded the eggs with embryos growing inside of them.|$|E

5000|$|Middle of Nowhere had {{a budget}} of $200,000 and was shot over {{nineteen}} days, half of the studio average of forty days, in June 2011. DuVernay told IndieWire's Claire Easton {{that it was difficult}} filming over {{a short period of time}} and thought that she could have used a couple more days. She continued [...] "It really would just allow us to have more takes, and explore things more. But ultimately, you know, my first film was shot in 15 <b>days,</b> <b>so</b> I gained 4 <b>days.</b> <b>So,</b> one <b>day</b> maybe I'll get out of the teens!" ...|$|R

5|$|Bradman’s batsmen {{set about}} {{building}} on their lead and Lindwall was initially {{not expected to}} bat; the Australian captain was expected to declare just before lunch on the fourth <b>day</b> <b>so</b> he could attack the English openers {{for a short period}} before the adjournment, but a shower deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball. Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times. Lindwall came to the crease to join Miller with Australia at 5/416 on the fourth afternoon. They attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller fell and Lindwall ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary. He missed and was stumped for 25. This prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460 immediately upon his dismissal, leaving England to chase a world record 596 for victory.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{reports that}} Xerxes sent his {{commander}} Hydarnes that evening, {{with the men}} under his command, the Immortals, to encircle the Greeks via the path. However, he does not say who those men were. The Immortals had been bloodied on the first <b>day,</b> <b>so</b> {{it is possible that}} Hydarnes may have been given overall command of an enhanced force including {{what was left of the}} Immortals; according to Diodorus, Hydarnes had a force of 20,000 for the mission. The path led from east of the Persian camp along the ridge of Mt. Anopaea behind the cliffs that flanked the pass. It branched, with one path leading to Phocis and the other down to the Malian Gulf at Alpenus, the first town of Locris.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1937 Colorado was the {{training}} ship for NROTC students from the University of Washington and University of California, Berkeley. She embarked the University of Washington students in Puget Sound on 15 June, and the University of California students four days later in San Francisco Bay. The ship arrived in Hilo, Hawaii, on 26 June and sailed two days later for Lahaina Roads, where the students practiced firing the 5"/51 caliber guns in whose casemates they were berthed in hammocks. Liberty in Honolulu began on 1 July, but was interrupted the following <b>day</b> <b>so</b> Colorado could join the search for Amelia Earhart. She rendezvoused with the Coast Guard cutter Itasca on 7 July; and launched seaplanes to search the Phoenix Islands. After holding a line-crossing ceremony on 9 July, she returned the NROTC students to their schools on the west coast.|$|E
50|$|The fair was {{traditionally}} held on 14 September until 1752 when Britain {{adopted the}} Gregorian calendar. The change involved correcting the calendar by 11 <b>days</b> <b>so</b> the fair <b>day</b> changed to 25 September.|$|R
