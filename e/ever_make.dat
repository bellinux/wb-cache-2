Failing {{to make the}} playoffs were the New York Giants and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, both with 10–6 records, due to losing tiebreakers for the sixth seed to the Green Bay Packers, who {{went on to become the}} first sixth-seeded team from the NFC to win the Super Bowl. The 2010 Seahawks were the first team in NFL history to win both a division championship and a playoff game with a losing regular season record. They currently have the lowest win percentage of any team to <b>ever</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the time}} of peak {{intensity}}, Dvorak intensity estimates reached T6.0, equating to a minimal Category 4 hurricane with winds of 135mph (215km/h). A trough located {{to the north of}} the hurricane began to weaken, causing the storm to track in a more westward direction. Kiko weakened slightly before making landfall near Punta Arena, on the southern tip of Baja California, with winds of 115mph (185mph). Kiko was thus the second major hurricane to <b>ever</b> <b>make</b> landfall on the Gulf Coast of Baja California since reliable recordkeeping began in 1949, with the other being 1967's Hurricane Olivia. Due to the small size and slow movement of the storm, it rapidly weakened, becoming a tropical storm by 1800UTC. Convection associated with the storm significantly diminished; the center of circulation became nearly devoid of thunderstorm activity early on August28. Shortly after emerging into the Pacific Ocean, Kiko was further downgraded into a tropical depression, and turned towards the southwest due to interaction with nearby Tropical Storm Lorena. Tropical Depression Kiko dissipated around 1800UTC on August29; however, its remnants continued southward before being absorbed by Lorena.|$|E
5|$|Kekal (sometimes stylized as KEKAL) is a {{heavy metal}} and {{electronic}} music band formed in 1995 in Jakarta, Indonesia. According to AllMusic, Kekal {{was one of the}} first heavy metal bands from Indonesia to make international inroads, and according to sociologist of heavy metal, Keith Kahn-Harris, was one of the few extreme metal bands from Southeast Asia to <b>ever</b> <b>make</b> more than a minimal impression on the global scene. Founded by two musicians known simply Yeris and Newbabe, the band underwent some shifts in lineup in its early years, but emerged with a consistent lineup of three key-members, guitarist/vocalist Jeff Arwadi, bassist Azhar Levi Sianturi, and guitarist Leo Setiawan. Frequently labeled as black metal, progressive metal, and avant-garde metal, Kekal plays a very diverse range of music styles within the frame of metal and rock, incorporating many other music genres such as ambient, electronic, jazz fusion, and progressive rock. Over the course of its career, Kekal has transitioned from a heavy metal-based style to a more experimental and electronic sound.|$|E
5|$|When Iselle made {{landfall}} on the Big Island with {{winds of}} 60mph (95km/h), {{it became the}} strongest tropical cyclone on record to hit the island, and {{one of only three}} storms to hit the island at tropical storm intensity or higher, along with Tropical Storm Seven in 1958, and Tropical Storm Darby in 2016. If Iselle had made landfall as a hurricane, {{it would have been the}} first hurricane to ever hit the Big Island. With estimated damage cost of $79.2 million (2014USD), Iselle surpassed Hurricane Dot in 1959 as the third-costliest tropical cyclone to ever hit the U.S. state of Hawaii, even after accounting for inflation. The only storms to cause more damage to the islands were hurricanes Iniki and Iwa in 1992 and 1982, respectively. In addition, Iselle was the third-strongest tropical cyclone to <b>ever</b> <b>make</b> landfall on the Hawaiian islands after hurricanes Dot and Iniki.|$|E

5|$|The 1970 Bhola cyclone is {{the deadliest}} {{tropical}} cyclone on record, killing more than 300,000people and potentially {{as many as}} 1million after striking the densely populated Ganges Delta region of Bangladesh on November 13, 1970. Its powerful storm surge {{was responsible for the}} high death toll. The North Indian cyclone basin has historically been the deadliest basin. Elsewhere, Typhoon Nina killed nearly 100,000 in China in 1975 due to a 100-year flood that caused 62 dams including the Banqiao Dam to fail. The Great Hurricane of 1780 is the deadliest North Atlantic hurricane on record, killing about 22,000 people in the Lesser Antilles. A tropical cyclone {{does not need to be}} particularly strong to cause memorable damage, primarily if the deaths are from rainfall or mudslides. Tropical Storm Thelma in November 1991 killed thousands in the Philippines, although the strongest typhoon to <b>ever</b> <b>make</b> landfall on record was Typhoon Haiyan on November 2013, causing widespread devastation in Eastern Visayas and killing at least 6,300 people in that country alone. In 1982, the unnamed tropical depression that eventually became Hurricane Paul killed around 1,000people in Central America.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Kujira, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Amang, was an {{extremely}} long-lived tropical cyclone that lasted for 16days affected the island nations of Micronesia, Taiwan, and Japan in April2003, {{as well as the}} earliest typhoon in a calendar year to <b>ever</b> <b>make</b> landfall on the latter. Forming from a broad area of disturbed weather as a tropical depression on April9 well removed form any landmasses, Kujira quickly intensified in its early stages, and was upgraded to a tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis. Strengthening slowed afterwards, though the storm attained typhoon intensity on April14. Intensification continued and late on April15, Kujira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg). Following peak intensity, Kujira would begin to track northwest and oscillate in strength, cresting an additional two times in intensity. On April21, the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to track erratically for several days east of Taiwan. However, on April24, Kujira would resume a northward track and begin to weaken, and on April24 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on Kyushu. Following landfall Kujira transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and continued to persist before these extratropical remnants crossed the International Dateline towards the end of April2003.|$|E

25|$|Serbia and Greece share a lot {{of mutual}} history in {{contemporary}} football. In Serbia, the Superleague Greece is closely followed due to the large migration of Serbian expat footballers to Greece, where the league has more {{money to pay for}} players' salaries than in Serbia—it is due to this reason that Greek football players are practically nonexistent in Serbia despite Serbian footballers having a large presence in Greek football. Serbian football players have frequently made their career heyday in Greece and have a special place in Greek popular culture. The first Serbian player to <b>ever</b> <b>make</b> a revered name for himself in Greece was Borivoje Đorđević, who represented Panathinaikos in the late 1970s. Arguably, Predrag Đorđević, affectionately called Djole by Olympiakos spectators, was one Serbian footballer to have played in Greece. Otherwise, Vladimir Ivić was the most successful Serbian football player to have played in Greece for a team other than Olympiacos—Ivić had an illustrious career with PAOK, before which he had played briefly for AEK Athens. In 1995, when UEFA suspension on FR Yugoslavia was lifted, the first international game played by a Serb club was precisely a friendly Red Star vs. Olympiacos, in Belgrade.|$|E
