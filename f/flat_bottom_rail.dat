5000|$|Within {{the quarry}} were eleven or twelve {{inclines}} used at various periods {{to access the}} slate workings and tipping areas. These were connected to the mill via lightly laid tramways using bridge and <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>rail.</b> Although the majority of this track was laid to [...] narrow gauge to match the Rhiwbach Tramway, {{there is some evidence}} that the earliest tramways in the quarry were laid to [...] gauge.|$|E
50|$|Many {{railways}} {{preferred a}} <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> section, where the rails could be laid {{directly on the}} sleepers, representing a marked cost saving. Indenting of the sleeper was the problem; where the traffic was heavy, it became necessary to provide a sole plate under the rails to spread the load on the tie, partly vitiating the cost saving. However, in main line situations, this form found almost universal adoption in North America and Australia, and in much of continental Europe. The United Kingdom persisted with bullhead rail in main line use, with widespread introduction of flat-bottom rail only starting in about 1947.|$|E
50|$|The railway {{companies}} became {{persuaded that}} the traditional bullhead forms of track needed revision, and after some experimentation a new <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> format was adopted. The British Standard sections were unsuitable and a new profile, a 109 lb/yard rail, was made the new standard. In 60 ft lengths, laid on steel baseplates on softwood sleepers, {{it was to be}} the universal standard. The fastenings were to be of a resilient steel type, and for secondary routes a 98 lb/yd rail was adopted. Regional variations still persisted, and hardwood sleepers and Mills clip fastenings were favoured on the Eastern Region, for example.|$|E

50|$|When {{the line}} was constructed, the track had been light, using <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>rails</b> spiked {{directly}} to the sleepers. The very sharp curves led to gauge spreading, even under the short wheelbase of the Terrier locomotives, and in 1910 the track was relaid in bullhead material. A second renewal took place later, in Southern Railway days, and a further time in association with easing and recanting {{of the most difficult}} curves in 1959.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, 210 ft of the up {{main track}} through {{the station was}} laid and {{ballasted}} using 110a and 113a <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> and wooden sleepers. The Ruston & Hornsby diesel shunter was moved from the isolated goods dock. This is the first standard gauge loco on the Somerset & Dorset mainline south of the Mendips since the demolition train departed in July 1967, exactly 42 years before. The wooden box van has also been moved to the same track. Progress in 2010 included acquiring a tracked Priestman Mustang excavator, finishing construction of the up platform wall, regrading of the cattle dock track bed and preparations for tracklaying, and the connection of the station to the mains drainage system.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} laboratory {{investigation was}} carried out to assess the structural adequacy of a disused PHO Class <b>Flat</b> <b>Bottom</b> <b>Rail</b> Wagon (FRW) for a single lane low volume road bridge application as per the design provisions of the Australian Bridge Design Standard AS 5100 (2004). The investigation also encompassed a review into the risk associated with the pre-existing damage in wagons incurred during their service life on rail. The main objective of the laboratory testing of the FRW was to physically measure its performance under the same applied traffic loading it {{would be required to}} resist as a road bridge deck. In order to achieve this a full width (5. 2 m) single lane, single span (approximately 10 m), simply supported bridge would be required to be constructed and tested in a structural laboratory. However, the available clear spacing between the columns of the loading portal frame encountered within the laboratory was insufficient to accommodate the 5. 2 m wide bridge deck excluding clearance normally considered necessary in structural testing. Therefore, only half of the full scale bridge deck (single FRW of width 2. 6 m) was able to be accommodated and tested; with the continuity of the bridge deck in the lateral direction applied as boundary constraints along the full length of the FRW at six selected locations. This represents a novel approach not yet reported in the literature for bridge deck testing to the best of the knowledge of the author. The test {{was carried out}} under two loadings provided in AS 5100 (2004) – one stationary W 80 wheel load and the second a moving axle load M 1600. As the bridge investigated in the study is a single lane single span low volume road bridge, the risk of pre-existing damage and the expected high cycle fatigue failure potential was assessed as being minimal and hence the bridge deck was not tested structurally for fatigue/ fracture. The high axle load requirements have instead been focussed upon the investigation into the serviceability and ultimate limit state requirements. The testing regime adopted however involved extensive recording of strains and deflections at several critical locations of the FRW. Three locations of W 80 point load and two locations of the M 1600 Axle load were considered for the serviceability testing; the FRW was also tested under the ultimate load dictated by the M 1600. The outcomes of the experimental investigation have demonstrated that the FRW is structurally adequate to resist the prescribed traffic loadings outlaid in AS 5100 (2004). As the loading was directly applied on to the FRW, the laboratory testing is assessed as being significantly conservative. The FRW bridge deck in the field would only resist the load transferred by the running platform, where, depending on the design, composite action might exist – thereby the share of the loading which needs to be resisted by the FRW would be smaller than the system tested in the lab. On this basis, a demonstration bridge is under construction at the time of writing this thesis and future research will involve field testing in order to assess its performance...|$|E

The track limited locomotive weight, and was gradually replaced by 87 lb per yard (43 kg/m) bullhead track, but this took until 1928. Cerney station was renamed South Cerney on 1 July 1924.

50|$|A contractor, Frederick Furness, was {{appointed}} on 9 July 1868 {{and he was}} prepared to take part of the payment for his services in preference shares. The canal was closed and the line was laid as far as possible on the towpath. Under certain bridges the line was laid at a lower level than the towpath, necessitating short downgrades to pass under; nonetheless the headroom at overbridges was very restricted, leading to problems later. At the locks quite steep gradients were employed to accommodate the change of level. The track was laid with <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>rails</b> weighing 50 to 60 lbs per yard spiked directly to the sleepers.|$|R
50|$|The same rail {{has been}} tested to 80 t axle {{loadings}} for mainline use, {{and can be used}} in tunnels and other locations where the loading gauge is restricted. Replacing <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> girder <b>rails</b> on sleepers and ballast with LR55 in tunnels can increase the head room by a minimum of 300 mm, without the need to excavate the tunnel invert. A method statement to undertake this transformation allows contractors to proceed on an incremental basis without closing the tunnel to rail traffic. Temporary transition <b>rails</b> link <b>flat</b> <b>bottom</b> and LR55 <b>rails,</b> until the conversion is completed. The extra loading gauge can then be used to install overhead electrification, or to move larger rail vehicles. These can include double deck passenger trains and freight trains with high cube (9 ft) maritime containers.|$|R

40|$|Källsner and Girhammar have {{developed}} a new plastic design method for wood-frame shear walls at ultimate limit state. The method is capable of calculating the load-carrying capacity of partially anchored shear walls, where the leading stud is not necessarily anchored against uplift. In fully anchored shear walls, the leading stud needs to be anchored using some kind of hold-downs to resist uplift and the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> needs to be fixed by anchor bolts to resist horizontal shear forces. In partially anchored shear walls, where hold-downs are not provided, the uplifting force is resisted by the sheathing-to-framing joints along the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail.</b> Hence, {{it is important that}} the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> is anchored to the floor structure or foundation by anchor bolts and, therefore, able to transmit the forces to the structure below. Because of the eccentric load transfer, transverse bending is developed in the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> and splitting of the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> can occur. In order to use the plastic design method, a ductile behaviour of the sheathing-to-framing joints must be ensured. In this paper, results of tests on the splitting capacity of the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> due to uplift in partially anchored shear walls are presented. Specimens with single-sided sheathing were tested, varying the size of washer, pith orientation of the <b>bottom</b> <b>rails</b> and anchor bolt position along the width of the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail.</b> The aim of the tests was to evaluate the influence of these parameters in order to avoid splitting failure of the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail.</b> Two types of brittle failure modes occurred during testing: (1) a crack opening from the bottom surface of the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> and (2) a crack opening from the edge surface of the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> along the line of sheathing-to-framing joints. These failure modes were mainly dependent on the washer size and the location of the anchor bolt. The results show that the distance between the edge of the washer and the loaded edge of the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> has a decisive influence on the maximum load and the failure modes of the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail.</b> Godkänd; 2012; 20120905 (giucap...|$|R

40|$|In {{partially}} anchored {{timber frame}} shear walls, hold-down devices are not provided; hence the uplift forces are transferred by the fasteners of the sheathing-to-framing joints into the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> and via anchor bolts from the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> into the foundation. Since the {{force in the}} anchor bolts and the sheathing-to-framing joints do not act in the same vertical plane, the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> is subjected to tensile stresses {{perpendicular to the grain}} and splitting of the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> may occur. This paper presents simple analytical models based on fracture mechanics for the analysis of such <b>bottom</b> <b>rails.</b> An existing model is reviewed and several alternative models are derived and compared qualitatively and with experimental data.

40|$|Källsner and Girhammar [1] have {{presented}} a new plastic design method for wood-framed shear walls at ultimate limit state. This method allows the designer {{to calculate the}} load-carrying capacity of shear walls partially anchored, where the leading stud is not fully anchored against uplift. The anchorage system of shear walls is provided from anchor bolts and hold downs. Anchor bolts provide horizontal shear continuity between the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> and the foundation. Hold downs are directly connected from the vertical end stud to the foundation. When hold downs are not provided, the bottom row of nails transmits the vertical forces in the sheathing to the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> (instead of the vertical stud) where the anchor bolts will further transmit the forces into the foundation. Because of the eccentric load transfer, due to forces acting in the same vertical plane, transverse bending is created in the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> and splitting often occurs. It is important to evaluate this cross-wise bending {{and to ensure that}} no brittle failure occur in the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail.</b> The <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> is experimentally studied with respect to two primary failure modes, splitting along the bottom of the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> due to cross-wise bending and splitting along the edge side of the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> due forces perpendicular to the grain from the sheathing-to-framing connections. The parameters varied are the size of the washer and the orientation of the pith. The <b>bottom</b> <b>rail</b> was subjected to loading perpendicular to grain through two-sided sheathing. In this report the different set of series are presented. Five sets were conducted {{depending on the size of}} the washer and in each set the pith was placed upwards and downwards. The tests showed three different failure modes. In addition to the failure modes that the testing program was aimed at, splitting along the bottom or side of the <b>bottom</b> <b>rail,</b> the final failure was also due to plastic bending and withdrawal of the sheathing-to-framing nails. The results show that the size of the washer has a significant influence on the maximum load and the failure modes. The results show also that the orientation of the pith have a significant influence on the maximum load. Godkänd; 2012; 20120116 (giucap...|$|R
