Also, the necking of the heated plug metal under a tensile heating/forging load has been eliminated through the usage of the dual chamfered plate hole...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review was to critically appraise {{the psychometric properties of}} antipsychotic medication <b>side</b> effect assessment <b>tools.</b> Methods: Systematic searches were undertaken in PubMed, CINAHL and CENTRAL from inception to October 2014. Studies were included if they detailed the evaluation of psychometric properties of antipsychotic medication <b>side</b> effect assessment <b>tools</b> in mental health populations. Studies were excluded if they examined the use of antipsychotic medication <b>side</b> effect assessment <b>tools</b> in non-mental health populations, including people suffering from dementia, Parkinsonism and Alzheimer’s. Narrative reviews and studies published in any language other than English were also excluded. Results: Content validity was appropriately established for only one of the tools, reliability was inappropriately evaluated for all but one tool, and the assessment of responsiveness was not acceptable for any tool. Conclusion: Further psychometric studies are warranted to consolidate the psychometric properties of the included antipsychotic medication <b>side</b> effect assessment <b>tools</b> before any of these tools can be confidently recommended for either research or clinical purposes...|$|R

40|$|Friction Pull Plug Welding is a {{solid state}} repair process for defects up to one inch in length, only {{requiring}} single <b>sided</b> <b>tooling,</b> or outside skin line (OSL), for preferred usage on flight hardware. The most prevalent defect associated with Friction Pull Plug Welding (FPPW) was a top side or inside skin line (ISL) lack of bonding. Bonding was not achieved at this location due to the reduction in both frictional heat and welding pressure between the plug and plate {{at the end of}} the weld. Thus, in order to eliminate the weld defects and increase the plug strength at the plug `top` a small `hat` section is added to the pull plug for added frictional heating and pressure...|$|R

50|$|The fascine <b>knife</b> was a <b>side</b> arm / <b>tool</b> {{issued to}} 17th to 19th century light {{infantry}} and artillery. It served {{both as a}} personal weapon and {{as a tool for}} cutting fascines (bundles of sticks used to strengthen the sides of trenches or earth ramparts protecting the batteries). It could be straight or curved, double edged or single edged with a sawtoothed back. 17th- and 18th-century German, Prussian and Swedish fascine knives were more like cavalry swords, often with a brass handle and a hand guard, but later models were more like billhooks in shape and appearance. By the 20th century, it became the Pioneer's billhook in the British Army, used in World War I for making machine gun emplacements. In the Indian Army, it is known as a Knife Gabion (gabions, like fascines, are used for supporting earthworks).|$|R
