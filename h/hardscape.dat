500|$|The park's attractions include {{naturalized}} plantings {{that are}} inspired by the landscape that grew on the disused tracks, and views {{of the city and}} the Hudson River. The trail is made of pebble-dash concrete walkways that swells and constricts, swings from side to side, and divides into concrete tines that meld the <b>hardscape</b> with the planting embedded in railroad gravel mulch. [...] "By opening the paving, we allow the plants to bleed through," [...] said landscape architect James Corner, [...] "almost as if the plants were colonizing the paved areas. There's a sort of blending or bleeding or suturing between the hard paving, the surface for people to stroll on, and the planting...." [...] Stretches of track and ties recall the High Line's former use. Portions of track are adaptively re-used for rolling lounges positioned for river views. The 120-species plant palette, curated by Dutch landscape architect Piet Oudolf, includes rugged meadow plants such as clump-forming grasses, liatris, and coneflowers, with scattered stands of sumac and smokebush, but not limited to American natives. At the Gansevoort Street end, a grove of mixed species of birch already provides some dappled shade by late afternoon. Ipê timber for the built-in benches has come from a managed forest certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, to ensure sustainable use and the conservation of biological diversity, water resources, and fragile ecosystems. According to James Corner Field Operations, the High Line's design [...] "is characterized by an intimate choreography of movement." ...|$|E

50|$|From {{an urban}} {{planning}} perspective, <b>hardscapes</b> can include very large features, such as paved roads, driveways or fountains and even small pools.

Seven live oaks and other native trees - red maples, magnolias, and forest pansies - have been planted in the area around the garden to provide shade.|$|E
2500|$|The North Building {{is raised}} on 40 piloti (columns or piers) [...] high, which creates a vast space beneath the structure. [...] (One source {{says there are}} only 36 pilotis.)

2500|$|Named for its ever-present ledge, Bedrock Gardens {{was bought}} by its present owners in 1980, {{complete}} with a farm house, built circa 1740, a historic barn and three-holer outhouse. Over the next 20 years, it was extensively improved. The wooded areas were lumbered, a trail system was developed, and it was managed as a tree farm. A wildlife pond was built, and work was started on its multiple perennial and shrub beds. <b>Hardscape</b> {{in the form of}} walls, paths, water features and topographical improvements, have been added.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Simulation {{programs}} can help predict the energy use of individual buildings, {{and the results}} can then {{be used to determine}} effective means of reducing consumption. It is also useful to look at collections of buildings, specifically the exterior surfaces of those buildings such as roofs and facades and interstitial surfaces, for example, parking lots, sidewalks, parks, and roads. This is especially important in urban areas, where density and <b>hardscaping</b> causes a condition called the Urban Heat Island Effect (UHI). This proposal summarizes the current and future development of an urban scale computer modelling software program that first combines solar insolation measurements, material characteristics, and vegetation to help designers to study, predict, and suggest solutions to mitigate the UHI effect and allow for testing of strategies such as albedo modifications and increased use of planted areas that may prove productive in lessening overall energy consumption...|$|R

2500|$|The 2004 {{renovation}} of the infield, headed by design firm HNTB, {{was the first major}} {{renovation of}} the infield {{in the history of the}} track. In addition to the fanzone, a new vehicle and pedestrian tunnel was built under turn 1. [...] The tunnel posed a challenge to engineers because it was to be built under the water table. Another challenge came during construction when three named hurricanes passed by the track, flooding much of the excavation work. The infield renovation involved landscaping and <b>hardscaping,</b> such as a new walkway along the shore of Lake Lloyd, and the construction of 34 new buildings, including garages and fueling stations, offices and inspection facilities, and a club. The renovation project received a 2005 Award for Excellence from Design-Build Institute of America. Following the success of the UNOH Fanzone at Daytona, Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Kansas Speedway each built a similar infield fanzone. On December 9, 2016, the speedway announced that the University of Northwestern Ohio purchased entitlement rights to the fanzone, and that the area will be named 'UNOH Fanzone'.|$|R
