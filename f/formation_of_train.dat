Using a global eigenvalue analysis, two centrifugal global modes are identified: an asymptotically unstable three-dimensional weakly growing mode {{which appears to be}} originated by a Rayleigh instability; a marginally stable three-dimensional steady mode which is originated by a convective Gortler instability. Direct numerical simulations show that both modes {{play a role in the}} route to transition toward the turbulent flow. A structural sensitivity analysis is used to investigate the mechanism of selection of the path toward transition when small perturbations are considered. Finally, a scenario of transition via Gortler modes breakdown is studied in detail, revealing the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> <b>of</b> hairpin vortices in streamwise succession...|$|R

The quantitative parameters (extent of reversible strains, stability, temperature interval and stresses produced during heating and recovery of 'hot shape') crucially depend on the training route performed. The well trained specimens can do work even if the reversible shape memory effect is widely accepted as an unstable one.

The <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> martensite variants is thermodynamically favoured with respect to other crystallographically equivalent variants.
