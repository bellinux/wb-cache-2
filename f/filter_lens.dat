50|$|At {{the end of}} World War II Japan {{produced}} simple, {{tiny and}} inexpensive Hit-type cameras designed for the war-torn and destitute home market (see image). The Petie camera was created under similar conditions in post-war Germany. These cameras used 16mm film, against the 17.5mm film of the Japanese cameras, but both used paper-backed film and created 14mm square images. The Petie had a 20mm (f9.0) fixed-focus lens and a shutter speed set at 1/50 sec. The 1955 model came with a meniscus lens, later replaced with an achromatic lens. It came with accessories such as a closeup lens, yellow <b>filter,</b> <b>lens</b> hood, table top tripod, and case. All subsequent Kunik models were based on this one.|$|E
50|$|A pair {{of glasses}} with filters of {{opposing}} colors, is worn to view an anaglyphic photo image. A red <b>filter</b> <b>lens</b> over the left eye allows graduations of red to cyan from within the anaglyph {{to be perceived as}} graduations of bright to dark. The cyan (blue/green) filter over the right eye conversely allows graduations of cyan to red from within the anaglyph to be perceived as graduations of bright to dark. Red and cyan colour fringes in the anaglyph display represent the red and cyan colour channels of the parallax displaced left and right images. The viewing filters each cancel out opposing colored areas, including graduations of less pure opposing colored areas, to each reveal an image from within its color channel. Thus the filters enable each eye to see only its intended view from color channels within the single anaglyphic image.|$|E

40|$|Demand amplification, now {{frequently}} {{referred to}} as ‘‘bullwhip’’, is potentially a very costly phenomenon. It can lead to stock-outs, large and expensive capacity utilisation swings, lower quality products, and considerable production/transport on-costs as deliveries are ramped up and down at the whim of the supply chain. However, the detection of bullwhip depends on which ‘‘lens’’ is used. This in turn depends on the background and requirements of various ‘‘players’’ within the value stream. To gain insight into this scenario we exploit a relatively simple replenishment model. Because new and novel analytic solutions have been derived for all important performance metrics, comparison of the competing bullwhip measures is thereby greatly streamlined.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the positive effects}} of blue-violet light <b>filtering</b> <b>lenses</b> in delaying myopia and relieving asthenopia in juveniles. METHODS: Sixty ametropia juveniles (aged range, 11 - 15 y) were randomized into two groups: the test group (30 children, 60 eyes), wearing blue-violet light filtering lenses; and the control group (30 children, 60 eyes), wearing ordinary aspherical lenses. Baseline refractive power of the affected eyes and axial length of the two groups was recorded. After 1 -year, the patients underwent contrast sensitivity (glare and non-glare under bright and dark conditions), accommodation-related testing, asthenopia questionnaire assessment, and adverse reaction questionnaire assessment. RESULTS: After 1 y of wearing the <b>filtering</b> <b>lenses,</b> changes in refractive power and axial length were not significantly different between the two groups (P> 0. 05). Under bright conditions, the contrast sensitivities at low and medium-frequency grating (vision angles of 6. 3 °, 4. 0 °, and 2. 5 °) with glare in the test group were significantly higher than in the control group (P 0. 05). In the test group, the amplitude of accommodation, accommodative lag, and accommodative sensitivity of patients wearing glasses for 6 and 12 mo were significantly elevated (P 0. 05), and the asthenopia grating was not significantly decreased (P> 0. 05). In addition, after wearing glasses for 6 to 12 mo, the asthenopia grating of patients in the test group decreased significantly compared with the control group (P 0. 05). CONCLUSION: A 1 -year follow-up reveal that compare with ordinary glasses, short-wavelength <b>filtering</b> <b>lenses</b> (blue/violet-light <b>filters)</b> increase the low- and medium-frequency contrast sensitivity under bright conditions and improved accommodation. They effectively relieved asthenopia without severe adverse reactions, suggesting potential for clinical application.

The temperature cycling of the lens and the QCM verified the contamination of the lens as the cause of the deterioration. Data on the instrument performance in space and in the chamber allowed estimation of the rate of contaminant accretion on the lens in space service. That rate was used to estimate the contaminant partial pressure. The nature of material was inferred by comparison of the partial pressures and the saturated vapor pressures of materials at the temperature of the contaminated surface. These data, in conjunction with data on fields of view of the lens, are used to identify the sources of contamination...|$|E

The aim of this report is to investigate the potential for using Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) to take sun observations for the calculation of geodetic azimuths, to reduce pointing errors associated with solar observations. A protective <b>filter</b> <b>lens</b> was constructed that enabled safe and functional tracking of the sun. Software was also written that calculates an azimuth in the field to assist with the testing of the accuracy of this method. It was found that using the ATR tracking method on the sun was approximately twice as accurate when compared with the manual pointing method. The results of an averaged twelve set observation achieved results with a standard deviation of 12 ” over 11 observation periods, with a maximum error of 23 ”, when comparing the azimuth from the sun with the local geodetic control marks over a 350 m baseline. When compared to RTK GPS readings taken over the same baseline, the solar observations were found to give approximately twice as accurate an azimuth 72 % of the time. ...|$|E
50|$|Live {{images from}} the {{fluorescent}} dye and the surgical field are obtained {{using a combination of}} <b>filters,</b> <b>lenses</b> and cameras. During open surgery, hand held devices are usually preferred for their ease of use and mobility. A stand or arm can be used to maintain the system on top of the operating field, particularly when the weight and complexity of the device is high (e.g. when multiple cameras are used). The main disadvantage of such devices is that operating theater lights can interfere with the fluorescence emission channel, with a consequent decrease of signal-to-background ratio. This issue is usually solved by dimming or switching off the theater lights during fluorescence detection. FGS can also be performed using minimally invasive devices such as laparoscopes or endoscopes. In this case, a system of <b>filters,</b> <b>lenses</b> and cameras is attached {{to the end of the}} probe. Unlike open surgery, the background from external light sources is reduced. Nevertheless, the excitation power density at the sample is limited by the low light transmission of the fiber optics in endoscopes and laparoscopes, particularly in the near infrared. Moreover, the ability of collecting light is much reduced compared to standard imaging lenses used for open surgery devices.FGS devices can also be implemented for robotic surgery (for example in the da Vinci Surgical System).|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{the aim of}} {{this pilot}} study was to test whether {{retinitis}} pigmentosa patients would benefit from <b>filter</b> contact <b>lenses</b> as an effective optical aid against glare and photophobia. Methods: fifteen subjects with retinitis pigmentosa were enrolled in this study. All of them were evaluated with <b>filter</b> soft contact <b>lenses</b> (MaxSight), <b>filter</b> glasses (CPF 527) and without filters (control). All patients were assessed for the three aid conditions by means of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity (without glare and with central and peripheral glare) (CSV- 1000) and a specific subjective questionnaire about quality of vision. Results: BCVA was slightly better with filters than without filter but the differences were not statistically significant. Contrast sensitivity without glare improved significantly with the contact lenses (p< 0. 05). The central glare had significant differences for the frequencies of 3 cpd and 18 cpd between the contact <b>lens</b> <b>filter</b> and the control group (p= 0. 021 and p= 0. 044, respectively). For the peripheral glare contrast sensitivity improved with contact lens versus control group for highest frequencies, 12 and 18 cpd (p< 0. 001 and p= 0. 045, respectively). According to the questionnaire the contact <b>lens</b> <b>filter</b> gave them more visual comfort than the glasses filter under the scenarios of indoors glare, outdoors activities and indoors comfort.

Methods Experiment 1 : The relative changes in phototoxicity, scotopic sensitivity, and melatonin suppression of five blue-light <b>filtering</b> plano spectacle <b>lenses</b> were calculated based on their spectral transmittances measured by a spectrophotometer. Experiment 2 : A pseudo-randomized controlled {{study was conducted to}} {{evaluate the}} clinical performance of two bluelight <b>filtering</b> spectacle <b>lenses</b> (BF: blue-filtering anti-reflection coating; BT: brown-tinted) with a regular clear lens (AR) serving as a control. A total of eighty computer users were recruited from two age cohorts (young adults: 18 - 30 yrs, middle-aged adults: 40 - 55 yrs). Contrast sensitivity under standard and glare conditions, and colour discrimination were measured using standard clinical tests. After one month of lens wear, subjective ratings of lens performance were collected by questionnaire. Results All tested blue-light <b>filtering</b> spectacle <b>lenses</b> theoretically reduced the calculated phototoxicity by 10. 6 % to 23. 6 %. Although use of the blue-light filters also decreased scotopic sensitivity by 2. 4 % to 9. 6 %, and melatonin suppression by 5. 8 % to 15. 0 %, over 70 % of the participants could not detect these optical changes. Our clinical tests revealed no significant decrease in contrast sensitivity either with (95 % confidence intervals [CI]: AR-BT [- 0. 05, 0. 05]; AR-BF [- 0. 05, 0. 06]; BT-BF [- 0. 06, 0. 06]) or without glare (95 % CI: AR-BT [- 0. 01, 0. 03]; AR-BF [- 0. 01, 0. 03]; BT-BF [- 0. 02, 0. 02]) and colour discrimination (95 % CI: AR-BT [- 9. 07, 1. 02]; AR-BF [- 7. 06, 4. 46]; BT-BF [- 3. 12, 8. 57]).
