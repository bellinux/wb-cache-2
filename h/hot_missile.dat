2500|$|In January 1981, France and Morocco {{entered into}} a $4 billion {{military}} procurement deal in which, amongst other vehicles and equipment, 24 Gazelle helicopters were to be delivered to [...] Morocco. The Royal Moroccan Air Force operated these Gazelles, which were equipped {{with a mix of}} anti-tank missiles and other ground attack munitions, and made frequent use of the aircraft during battles with Polisario insurgents in the western Sahara region. The reconnaissance capabilities of the Gazelle were instrumental in finding and launching attacks upon insurgent camps due to their mobility.In addition, the <b>Hot</b> <b>missile</b> proved more than adequate to deal with the T-54/55 and BMPs of the polisario, destroying in one instance 18 T-55s and BMPs near Tan Tan.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, {{the end of}} {{the service}} life of the <b>HOT</b> <b>missile</b> system is in sight with the French opting to {{purchase}} Hellfire II missiles for their Tiger-HAD attack helicopters and the Germans planning to transition to the PARS 3 LR. Austria has decommissioned its HOT-carrying tank destroyers, while Spain is transitioning to Spike missiles to replace their <b>HOT</b> <b>missile</b> inventory. The <b>HOT</b> <b>missile</b> continues to be in widespread use {{in other areas of the}} world.|$|E
50|$|The <b>HOT</b> <b>missile</b> is tube-launched and {{optically}} tracked {{using the}} SACLOS guidance system with command link through trailing wires which steers the missile using thrust vector {{controls on the}} sustainer motor during the missile's flight. When the gunner fires the <b>HOT</b> <b>missile,</b> the missile activates a thermal battery, flares and a small gas generator spins up the gyro. The same gases for the gyro pop the covers off {{both ends of the}} cylindrical container the <b>HOT</b> <b>missile</b> comes packed in. Moments later, both the sustainer motor and the booster are fired, ejecting the missile from the container.|$|E

50|$|The Bundeswehr {{upgraded}} the Raketenjagdpanzer 2 tank destroyer {{to use the}} <b>HOT</b> <b>missile</b> in {{what was}} designated as the Jaguar 1. The Jaguar 1 mounted a single Euromissile K3S launcher and carried 20 HOT missiles, {{one of which was}} carried in the launcher. This tank destroyer was also used by Austria.|$|E
50|$|France {{developed}} {{a variant of}} the AMX-10P that substituted an armored four-tube <b>HOT</b> <b>missile</b> launcher called the Lancelot for the vehicle's regular 20mm cannon turret. The Lancelot turret carriers 20 HOT missiles—4 mounted and 16 stored inside—and uses a sight with X12 magnification as well as a laser rangefinder. The only known customer is Saudi Arabia.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{introduction}} of the HOT by Germany and France on ground vehicles, both nations introduced helicopters in the dedicated antitank role firing the HOT. The French used the Gazelle SA342M helicopter, which carries four HOT missiles in two dual launchers. Germany opted for the Bo-105 PAH-1, which is capable of carrying six HOT missiles in two triple launchers. Subsequently, the <b>HOT</b> <b>missile</b> was qualified for launch from other helicopters such as the German Tiger helicopter (carrying up to eight HOT's in two quad launchers) and the South African Rooivalk helicopter.|$|E

50|$|In {{an unusual}} move, in 1986 Euromissile offered a single-round ground-launched system for <b>HOT</b> <b>missile</b> called ATLAS (Affut de Tir Leger Au Sol - which {{approximately}} translates as light ground-firing mount) for installation on smaller unarmored vehicles, like the Jeep or Land Rover. The object was to field an antitank weapon that long-range patrols {{could use to}} engage heavy armor beyond {{the range of the}} tank's main cannon. The ATLAS is similar to the TOW mounted on various four-wheel-drive light vehicles. But unlike the TOW light vehicle mount, there is a shield to protect the gunner against the HOT's booster and sustainer motors, which are both burning as they exit the container. The vehicle mounting the ATLAS is expected to carry a mix of both HOT missiles with antitank warheads and the HOT with the multi-purpose warhead.|$|E

50|$|Unlike most antitank missiles, {{in which}} the booster burns {{completely}} before leaving the container and then the missile coasts a safe distance before the sustainer motor ignites, the HOT's booster burns both inside the container and outside the container for approximately one second giving the missile a high speed. The sustainer motor burns for 17 seconds, a flight time whose path exceeds {{the length of the}} trailing wires which dictate the maximum range of the missile. Because of the more powerful booster and sustainer motor that burns during its complete flight, the <b>HOT</b> <b>missile</b> had a much shorter flight time than any other wire guided antitank missiles when it was introduced. The booster's four nozzles are located at the roots of the four spring out fins. The sustainer motor's single exhaust is located {{in the rear of the}} missile body, where a vane controls the missile through thrust vector control as it rotates in flight.|$|E
50|$|The HOT {{has been}} used in combat in several wars, {{including}} the Iran-Iraq War, Lebanon, Chad, Western Sahara, the Gulf War of 1991 and in Lebanon in May 2007 against the Fatah al-Islam militants in the Nahr el-Bared camp north of Tripoli. In June 2011, French Gazelles helicopters fired <b>HOT</b> <b>missiles</b> on various pro-Qaddafi targets as part of the NATO operations enforcing UN Resolution 1973.|$|R
50|$|In the 1982 Lebanon War (Israeli Operation Peace in Galilee), M60 Pattons (locally named Magach 6) {{encountered}} Syrian T-54/55 and T-72s {{as well as}} PLO T-34s. Some {{were destroyed}} by Syrian infantry hunter-killer teams with ATGMs and supplemented by RPG-7s. Several other M60s were damaged by <b>HOT</b> <b>missiles</b> fired from Syrian Gazelle helicopters. One Magach 6 was destroyed by a T-72 and another was abandoned by its crew after taking damage.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the invasion Israeli Brig. Gen. Giora Lev’s 90th Division passed through Marjayoun and took up positions around Kaukaba and Hasbaiya. From there it began to push the Syrian 76th and 91st Armored Brigade, of the 10th Division, north up the Bekaa Valley towards Joub Jannine. The Syrians made skillful use of their Gazelle helicopters to support the delaying action, firing <b>HOT</b> <b>missiles</b> into the long columns of Israeli vehicles stretched out along the roads.|$|R
50|$|<b>HOT</b> <b>missiles</b> {{have also}} been mounted on wheeled {{vehicles}} such as the Panhard VCR/TH and the VAB VCAC with the Mephisto turret. Both the VCR and the VCAC carried four ready-to-launch missiles. The main advantage that the VAB Mephisto turret has over the TH turret is that both the operator and the missiles are both under armor and the Mephisto turret can be retracted flush with the vehicle's top for loading on either the C-130 or C-160 transport aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|By 1975, {{development}} was complete and evaluations had been performed by various ministries of defence. Mass production commenced in 1976 [...] {{and the first}} <b>HOT</b> <b>missiles</b> were fielded in 1978. A night-sight for firing from helicopters, the Viviane, {{was developed in the}} early 1980s. In 1985, the HOT-2 followed, with a multipurpose warhead variant called the HOT-2MP entering service in 1992. While less effective in terms of armor penetration, the HOT-2MP also produces fragmentation and incendiary effects.|$|R
60|$|The campfires flamed {{all along}} the lake walk, and the talk of each group could be overheard by any one who listened. Altercations went on with clangorous fury. Almost every party was in division. Some {{enthusiastic}} individual had made a find, or had seen some one else who had. His cackle reached other groups, {{and out of the}} dark hulking figures loomed to listen or to throw in <b>hot</b> <b>missiles</b> of profanity. Phrases multiplied, mingling inextricably.|$|R

5000|$|The Iraqis {{used their}} Mi-25 {{helicopters}}, along with Gazelle helicopters armed with <b>HOT</b> <b>missiles</b> against columns of Iranian mechanised infantry and tanks. These [...] "hunter-killer" [...] teams of helicopters, {{which had been}} formed {{with the help of}} East German advisors, proved to be very costly for Iranians. Aerial dogfights occurred between Iraqi MiG's and Iranian Phantom's. During this battle, the Iraqis also made first significant use of chemical weapons, contributing to their successes on the battlefield.63 During this instance, the Iraqis used large amounts of non-lethal tear gas to disrupt the offensive, throwing an entire attacking Iranian division into chaos.|$|R

The latest anti-tank and reconnaissance versions carry the Viviane thermal imagery system and so are called Gazelle Viviane. The Gazelle is being replaced in frontline duties by the Eurocopter Tiger, but {{will continue to be}} used for light transport and liaison roles.|$|R
50|$|Historically, the {{relation}} between the French Armed Forces and the Lebanese Armed Forces is very friendly, close and tight. After 1990, France continued to give Lebanon a modest military assistance. During the French-Lebanese military drill Cedre Bleu, French officials discussed a possible donation of 2 chalands de transport de matériel (CTMs) and <b>HOT</b> <b>missiles,</b> the deal was never accomplished. On December 2013, President Michel Suleiman announced that Saudi Arabia has decided to donate three billion dollars with the aim of purchasing French weapons for the Lebanese army. On February 2015, Saudi Arabia halted the $3 billion program for the supplies of French weapons to Lebanon.|$|R
