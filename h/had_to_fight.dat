5|$|As 2015 began, Ruf {{once again}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> for playing time; {{there was no}} clear opening {{for him on the}} Phillies' roster, {{notwithstanding}} {{the fact that he was}} one of the few players on the roster with the ability to hit for power.|$|E
5|$|A {{force of}} commandos landed to destroy {{machinery}} and other structures. Heavy German gunfire sank, set ablaze, or immobilised {{virtually all the}} small craft intended to transport the commandos back to England; the commandos <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> their way out through the town to try to escape overland. Almost all were forced to surrender when their ammunition was expended and they were surrounded and captured by the Wehrmacht defending Saint-Nazaire.|$|E
5|$|A {{northern}} {{route of}} retreat {{had too many}} obstacles, so Hunter's force retreated westward toward Charleston—with the Confederate army in pursuit. On June 19, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry was the rear guard. The regiment often <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> dismounted. Averell's entire division fought for two hours near Liberty. His cavalry division fought until its ammunition was exhausted, and then was relieved by Crook's infantry. Averell lost 122 men.|$|E
50|$|Original airdate: March 12, 2008For {{the rest}} of the episodes, no more teams, team captains, team challenges, and for the {{elimination}} fight, the fate was with the Chinese Drawers, where each fighter would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pull one drawer. If it's empty, the fighter would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> the elimination fight. If it's occupied with an amulet, the fighter would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight.</b> If the amulet is red, the fighter would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> in the red side. Same thing for the blue side.|$|R

5|$|Ljudevit Posavski, Croatian Duke of Pannonian Croatia, led a {{resistance}} to Frankish domination. Ljudevit also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> against Dalmatian Croatia, as their prince Borna was a Frankish ally. After unsuccessful resistance by Ljudevit and Pannonian Croats, the Franks again controlled Istria, Dalmatia, and Pannonia. Nevertheless, Dalmatian Croatia remained a semi-independent duchy {{between the two}} Empires, as they {{had a right to}} elect their own prince.|$|E
5|$|The 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion {{lost some}} men to German fire as they descended and, {{once on the}} ground, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> {{their way to the}} {{battalion}} rendezvous. Then headed for their first objectives capturing La Motte, which became the first village liberated in the South of France. By 12:00, they had taken all of their objectives, capturing over 100 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airlanding Brigade advance {{started on}} 17August along two axes, with the 12th Devons on the left, the 2nd OBLI on the right, and the 1st RUR in reserve.

5|$|Although {{the road}} had been opened between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the convoy still <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> through the {{numerous}} Chinese {{positions on the}} hills overlooking the road. On {{the first night of}} the retreat, the Chinese struck the convoy in force and inflicted heavy casualties upon 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5). Although strong air cover suppressed most of the Chinese forces {{for the rest of the}} march, the cold weather, harassing fire, raiding parties, and road blocks slowed the retreat to a crawl while inflicting numerous casualties. Despite those difficulties, the convoy reached Hagaru-ri in an orderly fashion on the afternoon of 3 December, with the withdrawal completed on 4 December.|$|E
5|$|In 681, Constantine IV {{signed a}} {{treaty with the}} Bulgar khan Asparukh, and the new Bulgarian state assumed {{sovereignty}} {{over a number of}} Slavic tribes that had previously, at least in name, recognised Byzantine rule. In 687–688, the final Heraclian emperor, Justinian II, led an expedition against the Slavs and Bulgarians, and made significant gains, although the fact that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> his way from Thrace to Macedonia demonstrates the degree to which Byzantine power in the north Balkans had declined.|$|E

5|$|In early November 2008, the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, at an {{informal}} lunch with foreign diplomats, criticized Iceland's traditional friends (particularly Britain, Sweden and Denmark) {{as well as}} the International Monetary Fund. According to a memo from the Norwegian embassy, he suggested that the Russians might want to use the Keflavík Air Base, the Russian ambassador replied that they had no need for it. The President is quoted to have said that Iceland would soon recover, even if they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> alone. The President does not necessarily agree with the government on these issues.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the ensuing}} decades, the Erie Railroad fell into debt {{along with its}} competitor, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. On September 16, 1960, the Interstate Commerce Commission {{approved}} the railroads {{to go forward with}} a merger, creating the new Erie-Lackawanna Railroad on October 15, 1960. The new railroad lasted only 16 years. In 1976, the Erie Lackawanna and several other large railroad companies were merged into the newly formed federal Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). At this point, stations <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> for survival. The station depot at Harriman has been closed and boarded up since at least 1970. Passenger train service, however, remained intact through the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The 44th Bombardment Group {{took part}} in an even more costly raid, {{the attack on the}} Romanian Ploesti oil fields, on 1 August 1943. When Johnson arrived at the target leading his group, he found that the 93d Bombardment Group had already {{attacked}} their target by mistake, and as a consequence, the defenders were alert. Although he would have been justified in turning back, Johnson led his group in through thick smoke, flak and explosions that concealed the tall smokestacks and barrage balloon cables. On the way home, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> off Me109 fighters.|$|E

5|$|The 4th Parachute Battalion secured {{its first}} objectives, {{the high ground}} {{overlooking}} the village of Le Muy {{from the north and}} the village of Les Serres, by 04:30. However the men left defending the village <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> off several small German counterattacks throughout the day. The battalion then assaulted and captured the bridge over the River Naturby, which carried the road to Le Muy, taking twenty-nine prisoners. The fighting cost the battalion seven dead and nine wounded.|$|E
5|$|The King of Scotland {{and local}} Welsh rulers had taken {{advantage}} of the long civil war in England to seize disputed lands; Henry set about reversing this trend. In 1157 pressure from Henry resulted in the young King Malcolm of Scotland returning the lands in the north of England he had taken during the war; Henry promptly began to refortify the northern frontier. Restoring Anglo-Norman supremacy in Wales proved harder, and Henry <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> two campaigns in north and south Wales in 1157 and 1158 before the Welsh princes Owain Gwynedd and Rhys ap Gruffydd submitted to his rule, agreeing to the pre-civil war borders.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans {{advanced}} to Changnyong itself {{during the afternoon}} of September 2, and ROK National Police withdrew from the town. North Koreans were in Changnyong that evening. With his communications broken southward to the 2nd Infantry Division headquarters and the 9th Infantry, Haynes during the day decided to send a tank patrol down the Yongsan road {{in an effort to}} re-establish communication. C Company, 72nd Tank Battalion, led its tanks southward. They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> their way down the road through several roadblocks. Of the three tanks that started, only the lead tank got through to Yongsan. There, it delivered an overlay of Task Force Haynes' positions to Bradley.|$|E

5|$|A man of {{progressive}} and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, {{he had a}} special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The Great Exhibition of 1851 arose from the annual exhibitions of the Society of Arts, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert {{served as president of the}} Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> for every stage of the project. In the House of Lords, Lord Brougham fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in Hyde Park. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.|$|E
5|$|Adnan led a 42-strong platoon {{from the}} Malay Regiment in the defence of Singapore against the invading Japanese. The {{soldiers}} fought at the Battle of Pasir Panjang, at Pasir Panjang Ridge in the Bukit Chandu (Opium Hill) area on 12–14 February 1942. Although heavily outnumbered, Adnan refused to surrender and urged {{his men to}} fight on until the end. They held off the Japanese troops for two days amid heavy enemy shelling from artillery guns and tanks and chronic shortages of food, medical supplies and ammunition (on {{the last day of}} the battle, Adnan and his men were only left with a few hand grenades and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> off the Japanese soldiers with their bayonets and through brutal hand-to-hand combat. Adnan was shot but carried on fighting.|$|E
5|$|After {{succeeding}} {{his father}} in 997, Stephen <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> for the throne against his relative, Koppány, who was supported by large numbers of pagan warriors. He defeated Koppány mainly {{with the assistance of}} foreign knights, including Vecelin, Hont and Pázmány, but also with help from native lords. He was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001 with a crown sent by Pope Sylvester II. In a series of wars against semi-independent tribes and chieftainsincluding the Black Hungarians and his uncle, Gyula the Youngerhe unified the Carpathian Basin. He protected the independence of his kingdom by forcing the invading troops of Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, to withdraw from Hungary in 1030.|$|E
