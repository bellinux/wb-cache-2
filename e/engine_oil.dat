Bond attacks the hotel where Greene and Medrano are finalising their plans and leaves Greene stranded in the desert with only a tin of <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> to drink.

5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After the routine maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several hours on the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
5|$|At an eco {{hotel in}} the desert, Greene tells Medrano that now he {{controls}} the majority of Bolivia's water supply, Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Planet Bolivia's sole water utility company at significantly higher rates. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills {{the chief of police}} (Fernando Guillén Cuervo) for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum, leaving him stranded in the desert with only a can of <b>engine</b> <b>oil,</b> wondering if Greene will get thirsty enough to drink it.|$|E

Outside, M tells Bond that Greene {{was found dead in}} the middle of the desert, shot twice and with <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> in his stomach.

5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, {{the more likely it}} is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used <b>engine</b> <b>oil,</b> or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E
5|$|Some early T-26 {{tanks were}} {{repaired}} in tank units or factories {{with the use}} of later production parts. This meant replacing the all-rubber road wheels (except the front wheels) and track idlers with new strengthened ones. Armour was added for the headlight, the armour thickness of the driver's hatch lower door of the twin-turreted tanks was increased from 6 to 10mm and armoured PT-1 or PTK observation devices were installed. A common hatch above the <b>engine,</b> <b>oil</b> tank, and fuel tank was mounted starting in May 1940. In 1940, 255 T-26s were modernised in this way and {{in the first half of}} 1941 another 85 tanks were improved. A central factory responsible for the T-26's repair and modernisation was the Factory of Carrying-and-Conveying Machines named after S. Kirov in Leningrad, and the Factory No. 105 named after L. Kaganovich in Khabarovsk from the beginning of the Great Patriotic War until 1945.|$|E
25|$|Heaters {{are also}} {{available}} for <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> so that warm oil can immediately circulate throughout the engine during start up. The easier starting results from warmer, less viscous <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> and less condensation of fuel on cold metal surfaces inside the engine; thus an engine block heater reduces a vehicle's emission of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide; also heat is available more instantly for the passenger compartment and glass defogging.|$|E
40|$|The local {{structure}} around Mo {{atoms in}} fuel-saving <b>engine</b> <b>oils</b> {{has been investigated}} by XAFS using laboratory scale equipment. The EXAFS {{results suggest that the}} local structure of the Mo atoms in fresh <b>engine</b> <b>oils</b> is similar to that in the molybdenum dialkyl phosphorodithioate. It is also suggested that the molybdenum compound in the oils changes to a Mo oxide in which a Mo atom is coordinated by six oxygen atoms after 2000 km running. XANES spectra of the compounds show that the coordination geometry around the Mo atoms in the Mo oxide is similar to that in MoO 3 rather than MoO 2. The deterioration of anti-friction effect of the <b>engine</b> <b>oils</b> after use coincides with Mo oxide formation...|$|R

25|$|A fume event {{occurs when}} bleed air used for cabin {{pressurization}} {{and air conditioning}} in a pressurized aircraft is contaminated by fluids such as <b>engine</b> <b>oil,</b> hydraulic fluid, anti-icing fluid, and other potentially hazardous chemicals. Turbine <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> is an irritant and contains neurotoxic chemicals such as tricresyl phosphate. The aviation industry claim that <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> does not contain sufficient quantities of such chemicals to cause long-term damage. However, there is some historical evidence {{that would seem to}} contradict this statement. In 1959, over 10,000 people in Morocco were paralyzed or otherwise effected after ingesting small quantities of tricresyl phosphate in their cooking oil. Unlike tricresyl phosphate, hydraulic fluid — although non-toxic in small quantities — is extremely irritating to the eyes and skin, which creates a hazard to pilots during a fume event but causes no lasting damage. Deicing fluid has a strong smell but is not very irritating or toxic.|$|E

The Turbo model also included an <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> cooler and integrated rear spoiler. The sports package, which was standard on the Turbo and optional on the base model, included a limited slip differential (LSD), TEMS, and headlamp washers. A new Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) was optional on both models. Also in 87 a new beige/tan color combination was implemented, and only 1000 models were produced with this scheme. Toyota installed its variable induction technology into the DOHC twin turbo 1G-GT called T-VIS and also included it into the 7M-GT engine as well.|$|E
40|$|The {{operating}} criteria, {{the assurance}} of energy-efficiency {{and environmental protection}} impose very diversified rheological requirements on the parameters of work of car <b>engine</b> <b>oils.</b> The aim of the work was the estimation of rheological parameters of selected car <b>engine</b> <b>oils</b> at controlled shear stress {{in a wide range}} of temperatures, using a rotational rheometer. Investigated mineral <b>engine</b> <b>oils,</b> semi-synthetic and synthetic ones that belong to different viscosity classes.

The results of tests at sub-zero and low temperatures indicate significant differentiation of rheological properties of <b>engine</b> <b>oils.</b> It can be claimed that in the exploited friction nodes, especially in the conditions of fluid and mixed friction, the smallest viscosity is characteristic to the fully synthetic oils from the tested group 5 W and the semi-synthetic oil Orlen Gas Semisynthetic 10 W- 40. Semi-synthetic oil Platinum Rally Sport 10 W- 60 stands out as its viscosity values at sub-zero and low temperatures are greater than the ones of mineral oils from the tested group 15 W- 40.
