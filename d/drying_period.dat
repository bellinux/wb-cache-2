40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length and dietary energy source in early lactation on milk production, feed intake, and energy balance (EB) of dairy cows. Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (60 primiparous and 108 multiparous) were randomly assigned to <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> lengths (0, 30, or 60 d) and early lactation ration (glucogenic or lipogenic), resulting in a 3 × 2 factorial design. Rations were isocaloric and equal in intestinal digestible protein. The experimental period lasted from 8 wk prepartum to 14 wk postpartum and cows were monitored for milk yield, milk composition, dry matter intake (DMI), energy balance, and milk fat composition. Prepartum average milk yield for 60 d precalving was 13. 8 and 7. 7 ± 0. 5 kg/d for cows with a 0 - and 30 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> respectively. Prepartum DMI and energy intake were greater for cows without a <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> and 30 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> compared with cows with a 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Prepartum EB was greater for cows with a 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Postpartum average milk yield until wk 14 was lower for cows without a <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> and a 30 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> compared with cows with a 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> (32. 7, 38. 7, and 43. 3 ± 0. 7 kg/d for 0 -, 30 -, and 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> respectively). Postpartum DMI did not differ among treatments. Postpartum EB was greater for cows without a <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> and a 30 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> compared with cows with a 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Young cows (parity 2) showed a stronger effect of omission of the <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> compared with a 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> on additional milk precalving (young cows: 15. 1 kg/d; older cows: 12. 0 kg/d), reduction in milk yield postcalving (young cows: 28. 6 vs. 34. 8 kg/d; older cows: 41. 8 vs. 44. 1 kg/d), and improvement of the EB postcalving (young cows: 120 vs. - 93 kJ/kg 0. 75 ·d; older cows: - 2 vs. - 150 kJ/kg 0. 75 ·d. Ration did not affect milk yield and DMI, but a glucogenic ration tended to reduce milk fat content and increased EB, compared with a more lipogenic ration. Reduced <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length (0 and 30 d) increased the proportion of short- and medium-chain fatty acids in milk fat and omitting the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> decreased the proportion of long-chain fatty acids in milk fat. In conclusion, shortening and omitting the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> shifts milk yield from the postpartum to the prepartum period; this results in an improvement of the EB in early lactation. An increased energy status after a short <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> can be further improved by feeding a more glucogenic ration in early lactation...|$|R
40|$|During the {{transition}} period, dairy cows experience a negative energy balance (NEB) {{caused by the}} high energy requirement for milk yield, while feed intake is limited. Severity of the NEB {{has been associated with}} an increased incidence of metabolic disorders and infectious diseases, inflammation, immunosuppression and oxidative stress. It is known that shortening or omitting the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> or feeding a glucogenic ration improves the energy balance (EB) in dairy cows in early lactation. It can be expected that an improvement of the EB due to shortening or omitting the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> results in reduced inflammation, immunosuppression and less oxidative stress in dairy cows in early lactation. The first objective of this thesis was to study the effects of <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length and dietary energy source on immune competence, inflammatory biomarkers and oxidative stress in dairy cows over 2 subsequent lactations. The second objective was to study the consequences of maternal <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length on colostrum immunoglobulin content and immune competence of calves in the first 12 weeks of life. In the current study, 167 cows were assigned to 3 <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> lengths (0, 30, or 60 d) and 2 early lactation rations (glucogenic or lipogenic). Cows were planned to have the same <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length and ration over 2 subsequent lactations. Omitting the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> reduced plasma bilirubin levels compared with a conventional <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> which is line with the better EB in cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Effects of <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length on inflammatory biomarkers, oxidative stress variables and natural antibodies (NAb) titers were, however, less consistent. Omitting the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> increased not only negative acute phase proteins (APP) in plasma, but also positive APP, oxidative stress variables in plasma, and NAb in milk. Shortening the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> to 30 -d did not influence inflammatory biomarkers and oxidative stress compared with a conventional <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> of 60 -d. Occurrence of clinical health problems did not differ between cows with different <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> lengths. In the current study, changes in positive APP and oxidative stress variables in plasma and NAb in milk could be explained by the occurrence of clinical health problems related to inflammation (clinical mastitis, fever, metritis and retained placenta), rather than a better EB due to a shorter or no <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Moreover, a higher titer of IgG binding lipopolysaccharide in plasma was associated with decreased odds of high somatic cell count and occurrence of clinical mastitis. In the first lactation after implementation of <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length and dietary treatments, feeding a glucogenic ration in early lactation increased NAb titers in milk compared with a lipogenic ration, which could be explained partly by a better EB. In the second lactation after implementation of <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length and dietary treatments, feeding a lipogenic ration in early lactation increased cholesterol levels in plasma compared with a glucogenic ration, which could be related to the high fat content in this ration. Cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> had a lower colostrum production and less immunoglobulins in colostrum compared with cows with a 30 -d or 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> After colostrum uptake, NAb titers in plasma of calves from cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> were lower {{during the first week of}} life compared with calves from cows with a 30 -d or 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Levels of specific antibodies in calves, after immunization in week 6 and 10, in calves were not affected by the maternal <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length. Birth weight of calves from cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> was lower compared with calves from cows with a 30 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> but not compared with calves from cows with a 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Growth of calves until 12 weeks of life was not affected by <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length. In conclusion, although shortening and omitting the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> improved the EB in early lactation, this did not result in clear consistent effects of <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length on inflammation or oxidative stress. Changes in inflammation biomarkers, oxidative stress variables and NAb in milk were a reflection of the occurrence of health problems related to inflammation in particular clinical mastitis and compromised uterine health. Furthermore, albeit omitting the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> compared with shortening or conventional <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> cows resulted in a reduced immunoglobulin content in colostrum and reduced NAb titers in plasma of their calves in the first week of life, but did not affect specific immune response of the calves in the first 12 weeks of life...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} was to study the effect of <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length in dairy cows on immunoglobulin content and natural antibodies (NAb) titers in colostrum, growth, and plasma natural and specific antibody titers in plasma of calves. Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (n = 167) {{were randomly assigned to}} 3 <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> lengths (0, 30, or 60 d). Colostrum production, concentration of colostrum IgG and IgM, and titers of NAb (isotypes IgG and IgM) binding keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and human serum albumin (HuSA) in colostrum were measured. Female calves were immunized with both KLH and HuSA at wk 6 and 10 of life. Titers of NAb and specific antibody (SpAb) for isotypes IgG, IgM, and total immunoglobulin (IgT) binding KLH or HuSA were determined in plasma of female calves. Primary and secondary antibody responses to KLH or HuSA from wk 6 and 10 were expressed as the increase in antibody titers to wk 10 and 11 of life after primary and secondary challenges, respectively. Pregnancy length for cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> was 3 d shorter compared with cows with a 30 - or 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Birth weight of calves from cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> was lower compared with calves from cows with a 30 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Growth of calves until 12 wk of life was not affected by <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length. Colostrum production and IgG and IgM concentration in colostrum were lower for cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> than a 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Natural IgG and IgM titers binding KLH or HuSA were lower in colostrum from cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> compared with cows with a 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Natural antibody titers (IgG, IgM, and IgT) binding KLH or HuSA in plasma were lower during the first 2 wk of life for calves from cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> compared with calves from cows with a 30 - or 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> After primary and secondary immunization of calves with KLH and HuSA, SpAb titers of calves were not affected by <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length. After secondary immunization, the response of IgG and IgT binding KLH was higher in plasma of calves from cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> The results of this study demonstrate that, although omission of the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> of dairy cows leads to lower plasma NAb titers in calves during the first 2 wk of life, SpAb titers in calves were not affected and even the secondary antibody responses were enhanced compared with calves from cows with a 30 - or 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period...</b>|$|R
40|$|A <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> of 6 – 8 {{weeks for}} dairy cows is {{generally}} thought to maximise milk {{production in the}} next lactation. However, the value of such a long <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> is increasingly questioned. In particular, shortening the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> shifts milk production from the critical period after calving to the weeks before calving. This shift in milk production could improve the energy balance (EB), health and fertility of dairy cows. The objective {{of this study was}} to systematically review the current knowledge on <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length in relation to milk production, EB, fertility, and health of cows and calves. A meta-analysis was performed for variables where at least five studies were available. Overall, both shortening and omitting the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> reduces milk production, increases milk protein percentage and tends to reduce the risk of ketosis in the next lactation. Individual studies reported an improvement of EB after a short or no <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> compared with a conventional <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Shortening or omitting the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> did not affect milk fat percentage and shortening the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> did not alter the odds ratio for mastitis, metritis, or fertility measures in the next lactation. So, current evidence for an improvement of health and fertility of dairy cows is marginal and may be partly explained by the limited number of studies which have evaluated health and fertility in relation to <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length, the limited number of animals in those studies and the variable responses reported...|$|R

The study included 491 cycles (<b>dry</b> <b>period</b> and lactation) and 4 998 results of test-day milking conducted in a herd of 230 Montbéliarde cows. The cows were kept in a free-stall barn and fed total mixed rations (TMR). The average length of the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> was found to be 85 days. The first <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> was 34 - 45 days longer than subsequent ones, which may have been due to the cows becoming acclimated after having been brought to the farm as in calf heifers.

40|$|A <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> {{of dairy}} cows is {{historically}} {{seen as a}} period during which the cow can restore its body condition and regenerate its mammary epithelium {{in order to be}} high yielding in the successive lactation. Recent work has indicated that high yielding cows generally experience a severe negative energy balance in early lactation. <b>Dry</b> <b>period</b> reduction is a strategy to improve the energy balance of dairy cows in early lactation. This thesis aimed at evaluating the influence of <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length on milk composition and milk quality. Milk composition parameters indicate the processing quality of milk for the dairy plant, and may also reflect the physiological condition and energy status of the cow. In this work, omission of the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> was related to a reduced β-casein fraction in early lactation milk. Applying a short (4 weeks) instead of a conventional (8 weeks) <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> resulted in increased plasmin activity in milk, but did not affect the β-casein fraction. Increased plasmin activity in relation to a shortened <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> was particularly found in milk of cows of third or higher parity, that generally had relatively high somatic cell count. At low somatic cell counts, <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> reduction or omission only tended to result in an increased plasmin activity due a higher casein concentration in milk. From increased concentrations of a number of low abundant proteins in colostrum of cows with a short <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> it was hypothesized that a short <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> was related to increased proliferation of mammary epithelial cells during the first days in lactation. Although the casein composition of milk was related to both plasmin activity in milk and the metabolic status of cows, which are both influenced by <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length, quantitative differences in casein composition of cows with different <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length were small.

Shortening the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> from 60 to 30 d reduced the αS 1 -CN fraction by 3. 8 % and increased the αS 2 -CN fraction by 5. 5 %. In milk from cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> the glycosylated κ-CN fraction in late lactation increased from 8 to 12 % between 6 and 2 wk prepartum. After calving, the glycosylated κ-CN fraction in milk was higher for cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> (6. 7 %) compared with cows with a 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> (5. 2 %). The glycosylated κ-CN fraction at 2 wk postpartum was negatively correlated with milk yield, suggesting that glycosylation was related to reduced productivity of mammary epithelial cells. In early lactation, the β-CN fraction was reduced in milk of cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> A lowered β-CN fraction was associated with high somatic cell count and greater parity, indicating that it was the result of proteolytic activity. In conclusion, casein composition changes that result from shortening the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> from 60 to 30 d are not expected to affect processing characteristics of milk. Applying a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> may affect processability of milk because of a higher glycosylated κ-CN fraction, and possibly because of higher proteolytic activity compared with a 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period...</b>|$|R
40|$|For decades {{there have}} been discussions about the {{necessity}} and optimal length of <b>dry</b> cow <b>periods.</b> Yet, {{there is still a}} lack of information referring to special questions. The effects of <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length on metabolism and productive efficiency are particularly well studied. However, there are hardly any studies investigating udder health, although udder diseases stand next in line to reproductive issues and lameness problems, when looking into reasons for culling. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the impact of different <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> lengths on udder health in the subsequent lactation. Therefore, a four week <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> was compared to a standard eight week <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> This study was conducted between April and October 2006 on the research farm of the Landesanstalt für Landwirtschaft, Forsten und Gartenbau Sachsen-Anhalt. Data from 75 cows were analyzed in this study. Cows were enrolled in one of two groups: group L (long) with an eight week <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> (n = 39 cows) and dry-off at day 56 prior to calving, and group S (short) with a four week <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> (n = 36 cows) with dry-off at day 30 prior to calving. Cows in group L were fed a low energy diet from dry-off until day 30 prior to calving. Then all cows were fed a moderate energy diet. Multiple milk samples for cyto-bacteriological analysis were taken before dry-off and after calving. Clinical examinations, i. e. inspection and palpation of the udder, were performed at dry-off and prior to calving. Farm documentation was included in the statistical analysis. The results show that cows with a shortened <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> had higher somatic cell count in milk for at least one week after the onset of lactation, compared to cows with eight week <b>dry</b> <b>periods.</b> Furthermore, it was found out for cows of both groups that non-physiological udder forms are associated with higher somatic cell count in milk before dry-off. Asymmetric udders are associated with higher somatic cell count in milk 21 days after calving. Short <b>dry</b> <b>periods</b> are detrimental for milk production. In conclusion, a shortened <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> can have a detrimental impact on milk production and somatic cell count. Cows with increased somatic cell count in their previous lactation should still be subjected to an eight week <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> to assure sufficient udder regeneration. Farms with high somatic cell count should take this into consideration when determining their <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length. It is recommended that one should conduct clinical udder examination and determination of somatic cell count before selecting the appropriate <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length. Based on these findings, it is possible to assume how subsequent lactation may develop for any cow. Asymmetric udders and high somatic cell count at dry-off are strong arguments against a shortened <b>dry</b> <b>period...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length on {{performance}} in the next production cycle was investigated in the active population of cows from the Pomerania and Kuyavia regions of Poland. <b>Dry</b> length <b>period</b> of the cows was calculated and classified (0, 1 – 20, 21 – 40, 41 – 60, 61 – 80, 81 – 100, > 100 days). The GLM, FREQ and CORR PEARSON procedures of the SAS package 9. 1 {{were used in the}} statistical calculations. The problem of <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length was found to be debatable. A <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> of 40 – 60 days would be the most favourable in terms of milk, fat and protein yield in the next lactation, the course of parturition and the proportion of calves born alive, and a <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> of 21 – 60 days would be the most beneficial in terms of the proportion of cows surviving the next production cycle. Extending or shortening the standard <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> of 40 – 60 days by 20 days causes a slight decrease in performance determined by the above parameters, whereas extending and especially shortening the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> by another 20 days, or the absence of a <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> have a severely negative effect. Compared to cows that had been dry for 40 – 60 days, the cows whose calving was not preceded by a <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> had lower lactation yield (by 25 % for milk, by 24 % for fat and by 20 % for protein), lower daily milk yield (by 22 %), were significantly more prone to miscarriage, and more frequently gave birth to dead calves, calves with physical defects or grossly malformed calves. Too long a <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> (beyond 100 days) may carry a risk of higher culling levels in the herd, shorter lactations, health abnormalities, and poorer reproductive performance...|$|R
5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{method is}} by gutting and beheading a Greenland or sleeper shark and {{placing it in}} a shallow hole dug in gravelly sand, with the now cleaned cavity resting on a small mound of sand. The shark is then covered with sand and gravel, and stones are placed {{on top of the}} sand in order to press the shark. In this way the fluids are pressed out of the body. The shark ferments in this fashion for 6-12 weeks depending on the season. Following this curing period, the shark is then cut into strips and hung to dry for several months. During this <b>drying</b> <b>period</b> a brown crust will develop, which is removed prior to cutting the shark into small pieces and serving.|$|E
50|$|Hay can be raked into rows {{as it is}} cut, {{then turned}} {{periodically}} to dry, particularly if a modern swather is used. Or, especially with older equipment or methods, the hay is cut and allowed to lie spread {{out in the field}} until it is dry, then raked into rows for processing into bales afterwards. During the <b>drying</b> <b>period,</b> which can take several days, the process is usually sped up by turning the cut hay over with a hay rake or spreading it out with a tedder. If it rains while the hay is drying, turning the windrow can also allow it to dry faster. However, turning the hay too often or too roughly can also cause drying leaf matter to fall off, reducing the nutrients available to animals. Drying can also be sped up by mechanized processes, such as use of a hay conditioner, or by use of chemicals sprayed onto the hay to speed evaporation of moisture, though these are more expensive techniques, not in general use except in areas where there is a combination of modern technology, high prices for hay, and too much rain for hay to dry properly.|$|E
5000|$|In {{animals that}} inhabit the wave-tossed tidal pools of rocky shores thermal optima vary for each species and dictate the species' {{tolerance}} of environmental conditions {{that lead to}} increased heating or loss of mechanisms for cooling. For example, exposure to sunlight when the tide is out, and lack of thermal insulation from the buffering effects of water due to its specific heat capacity may contribute to increased temperature leading to increased desiccation. An organism that has a high thermal optimum may {{still be able to}} function in this environment, while one with a lower thermal optimum may have its metabolic processes shut down during the <b>drying</b> <b>period</b> of exposure. An organism may be confined to a limited range of habitats due to the population's thermal optima, while another population may have a different range of habitats open to it due to a different thermal optima for its biological processes. Ultimately the ability to adapt to greater extremes in such a harsh environment as the rocky shores where tide pools are formed may then be discussed in terms of varying environmental thermal optima for different species.|$|E

The {{objective of the}} current study was to evaluate the influence of <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length on metabolic status and hepatic gene expression in cows fed a lipogenic or glucogenic diet in early lactation. Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (n = 167) were assigned randomly to 3 × 2 factorial design with 3 <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> lengths (n = 56, 55, and 56 for 0 -, 30 -, and 60 -d dry, respectively) and 2 early lactation diets (n = 84 and 83 for glucogenic and lipogenic diet, respectively). Cows were fed a glucogenic or lipogenic diet from 10 d before the expected calving date and onward. The main ingredient for a glucogenic concentrate was corn, and the main ingredients for a lipogenic concentrate were sugar beet pulp, palm kernel, and rumen-protected palm oil. Blood was sampled weekly from 95 cows from wk 3 precalving to wk 8 postcalving. Liver samples were collected from 76 cows in wk - 2, 2, and 4 relative to calving. Liver samples were analyzed for triacylglycerol concentrations and mRNA expression of 12 candidate genes. Precalving, cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> had greater plasma ß-hydroxybutyrate, urea, and insulin concentrations compared with cows with a 30 - or 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Postcalving, cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> had lower liver triacylglycerol and plasma nonesterified fatty acids concentrations (0. 20, 0. 32, and 0. 36 mmol/L for 0 -, 30 -, and 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> respectively), greater plasma glucose, insulin-like growth factor-I, and insulin (24. 38, 14. 02, and 11. 08 µIU/mL for 0 -, 30 -, and 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> respectively) concentrations, and lower hepatic mRNA expression of pyruvate carboxylase, compared with cows with a 30 - or 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Plasma urea and ß-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were greater in cows fed a lipogenic diet compared with cows fed a glucogenic diet. In conclusion, cows with a 0 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> had an improved metabolic status in early lactation, indicated by lower plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids, greater plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin-like growth factor-I, and insulin, and lower mRNA expression of pyruvate carboxylase in the liver, compared with cows with a 30 - or 60 -d <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Independent of <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> length, the glucogenic diet also improved the metabolic status compared with the lipogenic diet...|$|R
