40|$|The study {{investigated}} the use of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources by postgraduate students at three universities in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The main aim {{of the study was}} to determine the factors that affect the use of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources by postgraduate students. The study sought to fulfil the following objectives: to determine factors which affect the use of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources by postgraduate students at the three universities in the Eastern Cape, South Africa; to establish the <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources available among universities in Eastern Cape; to identify the pattern of postgraduate students’ use of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources; to find out the level of postgraduate satisfaction with <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources available for their information needs, and to suggest ways of stimulating the use of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources by postgraduate students at universities in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. A review of the literature revealed a growing reliance on electronic resources by higher education institutions worldwide to suffice the information needs of academic researchers and that usage of these is influenced by various factors. The factors identified in the reviewed literature as affecting the use of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources among students include: academic discipline affiliation, age, level of study, gender, information and communications technology (ICT) literacy, institutional support, relevance of available information resources, accessibility, marketing and publicity of information sources available, and training. The researcher employed a survey research methodology to achieve the study objectives, through data collection on three fronts. Firstly to investigate the factors hat affect the use of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources from the perspectives of postgraduate students, self-administered questionnaires were distributed to a sample of 200 study participants obtained using quota sampling of the population of students from the three universities. A response rate of 66. 5 % was achieved. Secondly, data on the organisational factors influencing the use of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources were obtained by conducting semi-structured interviews with selected librarians at the three universities. Lastly, documentary analysis was also used to corroborate data obtained from the survey with postgraduate study participants, as well as from interviews with selected librarians. The findings include that the use of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources is increasingly becoming important for postgraduate students at the selected universities in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Postgraduate students believe that <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources are useful in their academic work. There was moderate use of subscription e-databases and e-journals. Level of study and age were found to affect the use of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources, with older, Masters and PhD students utilising e-databases and e-journals more frequently. Postgraduate students predominantly use search engines to gain access to <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources, while Online Public Access Catalogues (OPACs) and library websites were unpopular gateways to <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources. Universities in the Eastern Cape were found to be supportive of the use of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources with budgets of libraries and future plans tipped in favour of electronic resource provision. From the findings of the study the key recommendations suggested for improving the use of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources by postgraduate students in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, include that Information literacy training programmes at the three universities may be tailor-made to cater for the information needs of postgraduate students at varying levels and academic disciplines of study. It was also recommended that the universities incorporate the use of federated searching and searchable journals management software on their library websites, in order to increase the visibility of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>information</b> sources among postgraduate students...|$|R

40|$|The paper aims {{to study}} the {{perception}} of postgraduate students on importance of <b>internet-based</b> <b>information</b> resources for accomplishing their academic tasks. In this study, questionnaire method was used for data collection. A total 130 questionnaires were distributed to the postgraduate students of twenty departments at University of Mysore and 123 filled-in questionnaires were received back with overall response rate of 97. 69 %. The study findings reveal that the postgraduate students depend on numerous internet-based resources for fulfill their various academic tasks. For example 'Online dictionary' used for looking definition of concept, 'Google books' for looking required books, 'Google scholar' for looking articles, 'Virtual reference services' for looking answer to some specific questions. Search engines are {{the most commonly used}} source for accomplishing the complex academic activities such as preparing 'Class Assignments / Seminars' and 'Academic Examination'. However, the new <b>internet-based</b> <b>information</b> resources 'Social Network Sites like Facebook' are very less important sources for performing both the simple and complex academic task of the postgraduate students. Even though, the use of <b>internet-based</b> <b>information</b> resources have been increased considerably, the traditional resources still play significant role than some other popular internet-based resources for performing the some specific tasks.

The result shows that the students’ ability in searching and evaluating <b>internet-based</b> <b>information</b> is low which means that their information literacy is also low. Based on this research’s result the writer suggests that LIS department of UIN should collaborate with UIN’s central library to increase the frequency of information literacy programs, by holding more seminars and workshops; the writer also suggests the need to include information literacy education in the curriculum of LIS department, and in other departments too.
