Computed 298 K enthalpy diagrams at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 +G(d,p) level of theory confirm the exothermic formation of the N-methylbenzonitrilium ions starting with ionized chloro- and nitrobenzene molecular ions. In this last case, two other exothermic processes are also detected: (i) an oxygen atom transfer yielding ionized nitrosobenzene and neutral methyl isocyanate and (ii) a loss of carbon monoxide from the ion/molecule reaction product generated when metastably generated phenoxy cations (produced in the hexapole collision cell) react with methyl isocyanide.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recently, CT (CAT) {{scanning}} {{technology has been}} utilized to analyze snow and ice samples. To facilitate applying this technology to natural snow, a procedure has been developed that allows snow specimens to be transported from an outdoor location to the laboratory {{for the purpose of}} CT imaging. A snow sample is first obtained in a tubular container. A screen is placed beneath the container, and <b>dimethyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> cooled to a temperature just below O°C is slowly poured {{in the top of the}} snow. The wetting front moves downward, filling the pore space and expelling air out the base of the specimen. Packing the sample in dry ice freezes the substance in the pore space, protecting the snow microstructure and prohibiting metamorphism during transportation. The methodology presented is intended for CT imaging, which offers a nondestructive means to investigate grain structure and intergranular bonding, but is also applicable to surface sectioning.

In this research which is an interventional and experimental study, the screen cage method was used to estimate PT and FT of repellents against An. stephensi. The following commercial formulations of chemical repellents were tested: Iranian DMP lotion (DMP 60) (contains 60 % <b>dimethyl</b> <b>phthalate,</b> 25 % isopropyl alcohol, 5 % twine 80 and 10 % water), MIP 60 and Dimp 31. 7 lotions contains 60 and 31. 7 % active ingredient of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> and trench pomade (a combination of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) and DMP).
