25|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{excision repair}} (NER) pathway is {{a mechanism to}} repair damage to DNA. ERCC2 is involved in transcription-coupled NER and is an integral member of the basal transcription factor BTF2/TFIIH complex. ERCC3 is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase that functions in NER. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> subunit of basal transcription factor 2 (TFIIH) and, thus, functions in class II transcription. XPG (ERCC5) forms a stable complex with TFIIH, which is active in transcription and NER. ERCC6 encodes a DNA-binding protein that is important in transcription-coupled excision repair. ERCC8 interacts with Cockayne syndrome type B (CSB) protein, with p44 (GTF2H2), a subunit of the RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH, and ERCC6. It is involved in transcription-coupled excision repair.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> buzzword and is {{frequently}} applied to {{any form of}} large-scale data or information processing (collection, extraction, warehousing, analysis, and statistics) {{as well as any}} application of computer decision support system, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and business intelligence. The book Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques with Java (which covers mostly machine learning material) was originally to be named just Practical machine learning, and the term data mining was only added for marketing reasons. Often the more general terms (large scale) data analysis and analytics – or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning – are more appropriate.|$|E
25|$|As seen above, {{combustion}} converts {{less than}} half the mass of black powder to gas, most of it turns into particulate matter. Some of it is ejected, wasting propelling power, fouling the air, and generally being a nuisance (giving off a soldier position, generating fog that hinders vision, etc.). Some of it ends up as a thick layer of soot inside the barrel, where <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> nuisance for subsequent shots, and a cause of jamming an automatic weapon. Moreover this residue is hygroscopic, and with the addition of moisture absorbed from the air forms a corrosive substance. The soot contains potassium oxide or sodium oxide that turns into potassium hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide, which corrodes wrought iron or steel gun barrels. Black powder arms must therefore be well cleaned after use, both inside and out, to remove the residue.|$|E

2500|$|Amoxicillin {{attaches}} to the cell wall of susceptible bacteria and results in their death. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> bactericidal compound.

As a derivative of ampicillin, amoxicillin {{is a member of}} the same family as penicillins and like them, is a β-lactam antibiotic. It inhibits cross-linkage between the linear peptidoglycan polymer chains that make up a major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive and a minor component of Gram-negative bacteria. Gram negative bacteria are not generally susceptible to Beta-lactam antibiotics.|$|E
