Internal communications were difficult and the country lacked an obvious geographical centre. Dunfermline emerged as a major royal centre in the reign of Malcolm III and Edinburgh began {{to be used to}} house royal records in the reign of David I, but, perhaps because of its proximity and vulnerability to England, it did not become a formal capital <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
