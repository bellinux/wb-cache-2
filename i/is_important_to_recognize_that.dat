25|$|In {{understanding}} Maya medicine, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> the Maya equated sickness {{with the}} captivity of one’s soul by supernatural beings, angered by some perceived misbehavior. For this reason, curing a sickness involved elements of ritual, cleansing and herbal remedy. Research of Maya ethno-medicine shows that though supernatural causes {{are related to}} illness, {{a large percentage of}} Maya medical texts are devoted to the treatment of symptoms based upon objective observations of the effects of certain plants on the human system. Herbal remedies were ingested, smoked, snorted, rubbed on the skin, and even used in the form of enemas to force rapid absorption of a substance into the blood stream. Cleansing techniques included fasting, sweating and purging flushed substances out of the body.|$|E

25|$|In {{the media}} and popular science, quantum non-locality is often portrayed as being {{equivalent}} to entanglement. While {{it is true that}} a pure bipartite quantum state must be entangled in order for it to produce non-local correlations, there exist entangled states that do not produce such correlations, and there exist non-entangled (separable) quantum states that present some non-local behaviour. A well-known example of the first case is the Werner state that is entangled for certain values of , but can always be described using local hidden variables. In short, entanglement of a two-party state is necessary but not sufficient for that state to be non-local. Moreover, it was shown that, for arbitrary number of party, there exist states that are genuinely entangled but admits a fully local strategy. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> entanglement is more commonly viewed as an algebraic concept, noted for being a precedent to non-locality as well as to quantum teleportation and to superdense coding, whereas non-locality is defined according to experimental statistics and is much more involved with the foundations and interpretations of quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{problems}} encountered will benefit from special attention, as problems are often related more to “input and output” issues than to intellectual impairment. Problems with eye movement control {{make it difficult for}} people with A-T to read, yet most fully understand the meaning and nuances of text that is read to them. Delays in speech initiation and lack of facial expression make it seem that they do not know the answers to questions. Reduction of the skilled effort needed to answer questions, and an increase of the time available to respond, is often rewarded by real accomplishment. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> intellectual disability is not regularly a part of the clinical picture of A-T although school performance may be suboptimal because of the many difficulties in reading, writing, and speech. Children with A-T are often very conscious of their appearance, and strive to appear normal to their peers and teachers. Life within the ataxic body can be tiring. The enhanced effort needed to maintain appearances and increased energy expended in abnormal tone and extra movements all contribute to physical and mental fatigue. As a consequence, for some a shortened school day yields real benefits.|$|E

2500|$|A key step in {{managing}} weeds in any pasture system is identification. [...] Once the undesired species in a pasture system are identified, an integrated approach of management {{can be implemented}} to control weed populations. [...] It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> no single approach to weed management will result in weed free pastures; therefore, various cultural, mechanical, and chemical control methods can be combined in an integrated weed management plan. [...] Cultural controls include: avoiding spreading manure contaminated with weed seeds, cleaning equipment after working in weed infested areas, and managing weed problems in fencerows and other areas near pastures. [...] Mechanical controls such as repeated mowing, clipping, and hand weeding {{can also be used}} to effectively manage weed infestations by weakening the plant. [...] These methods should be implemented when weed flower buds are closed or just starting to open to prevent seed production. [...] Although these methods for managing weeds greatly reduces reliance on herbicides, weed problems may still persist in managed grazing systems and the use of herbicides may become necessary. [...] Use of herbicides may restrict the use of a pasture for some length of time, depending on the type and amount of the chemical used. [...] Frequently, weeds in pasture systems are patchy and therefore spot treatment of herbicides may be used as a least cost method of chemical control.|$|E
2500|$|British {{colonial and}} Imperial actions in Africa {{could also be}} seen as {{contributing}} to this negative portrayal of African heritage; indeed, the passages describing the [...] "negro" [...] bear some similarities to the heavily racist language in famous works associated with imperialism, such as Conrad's Heart of Darkness (which predates The Mystery of the Sea by only three years). In both novels, the black characters are portrayed as atavistic and savage, but Stoker's portrayal is much more simplistic, pinning the origin of evil directly on the [...] "negro". Regardless of how the reader reacts to Conrad's and Stoker's respective descriptions of dark-skinned people, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> <b>that</b> The Mystery of the Sea {{is part of a larger}} discourse on race that was influenced by the vitality of the British Empire. Indeed, racism has been characterized by some as [...] "colonialism brought home", which fits in with Archibald's thoughts on the one black character in the novel as well as the larger political and imperialist themes of the work. Archibald is not directly involved with the conflict in Cuba, nor is he involved with colonization (although colonial implications could possibly be drawn from the fact that he is an Englishman living in Scotland). However, despite Archibald's lack of immediate involvement in British Imperial schemes, he is an embodiment of popular perceptions of race and [...] "civilization" [...] as the British knew it. He feels no qualms about killing the black man, recognizes an active evil in this racial [...] "other", and triumphs in rescuing the purity of his white beloved from the threat of her dark-skinned attacker.|$|E
