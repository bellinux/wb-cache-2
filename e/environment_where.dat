5|$|A {{planet that}} can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not {{originate}} there. Earth provides liquid water—an <b>environment</b> <b>where</b> complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism. The distance of Earth from the Sun, {{as well as}} its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.|$|E
5|$|Golden Sun also {{features}} an optional battling mode accessible from the menu screen. In this mode, players can enter {{a team from}} their saved game files into an arena <b>environment</b> <b>where</b> they battle increasingly difficult CPU-controlled enemies. Additionally, players can select three of their four characters to fight another player's three-character team. The player does not receive any reward or punishment for participating in these battles.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the novella, in which the physical transformation of Jekyll into Hyde is revealed near the end, most dramatic adaptations show it early in the play, because the audience {{is familiar with the}} story. As one of its first adapters, Sullivan worked in an <b>environment</b> <b>where</b> the transformation would still shock the audience, and he held the reveal until the third act.|$|E
5|$|The Pangaré Brumbies {{appear to}} have adapted well to their coastal <b>environment,</b> <b>where</b> they are {{consuming}} saltbush, which they {{do not appear to}} be damaging. The Department of Environment and Conservation and the Outback Heritage Horse Association of Western Australia (OHHAWA) are monitoring these particular Brumbies to ensure the careful management of these unusual feral horses.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} Mérens {{are the result of}} the harsh mountain <b>environment</b> <b>where</b> they live, and they are reminiscent of the horses in the cave drawings at Niaux, made some 13,000 years ago.

25|$|Ripple marks also form in flowing water. There are {{two types}} of ripples: {{symmetric}} and asymmetric. <b>Environments</b> <b>where</b> the current is in one direction, such as rivers, produce asymmetric ripples. The longer flank of such ripples is on the upstream side of the current. Symmetric wave ripples occur in <b>environments</b> <b>where</b> currents reverse directions, such as tidal flats.|$|R
50|$|One design goal of DD+ is quality {{playback}} in {{a variety}} of environments, ranging from home theaters and other acoustically controlled <b>environments</b> <b>where</b> high dynamic range playback is feasible, to portable and automotive <b>environments</b> <b>where</b> lots of background noise is present, and dynamic range compression may be necessary to make all parts of an audio program audible.|$|R
5|$|While most marine {{bioluminescence}} {{is green}} to blue, some deep sea barbeled dragonfishes in the genera Aristostomias, Pachystomias and Malacosteus emit a red glow. This adaptation allows {{the fish to}} see red-pigmented prey, which are normally invisible in the deep ocean <b>environment</b> <b>where</b> red light has been filtered out by the water column.|$|E
5|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} {{are used}} as bioindicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are sessile {{so that they are}} representative of the <b>environment</b> <b>where</b> they are sampled or placed. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is used by some water treatment plants to test for estrogen-mimicking pollutants from industrial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist <b>environment</b> <b>where</b> organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the ear canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E

5|$|Habitat destruction, such as forest {{clearing}} {{for commercial}} logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, {{is the most}} detrimental activity {{on the distribution of}} these rabbits. Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, they do not thrive in only mature forests untouched by destruction, yet they do not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the <b>environment</b> <b>where</b> it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status.|$|E
5|$|In an <b>environment</b> <b>where</b> motor {{transport}} {{could not}} operate, the Australian Army {{was forced to}} rely on air transport and native carriers, two modes of transportation that it had never used before. The Australian Army had many lessons to learn, but it proved capable of adapting to the circumstances it found itself in. The fighting along the Kokoda Track was but {{the start of the}} effort to drive the Japanese from New Guinea that would continue in 1943.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, the United States was still {{primarily}} a rural country, especially in self-identity. D. W. Griffith's The Musketeers of Pig Alley (1912) {{is one of}} the earliest American films to feature urban organized crime. Prohibition's arrival in 1920 created an <b>environment</b> <b>where</b> anyone who wanted to drink had to consort with criminals, especially in urban areas. Nonetheless, the urban-crime genre was mostly ignored until 1927 when Underworld, which is recognized as the first gangster movie, became a surprise hit.|$|E

5|$|Most of Carabane {{is covered}} in mangroves, forming an impassable jungle {{that can only be}} crossed in {{constructed}} passages. Mangroves are among the few species capable of adapting to the highly saline <b>environment,</b> <b>where</b> the quantity of oxygen in the soil is low. In recent decades there has been concern that the mangroves are less prevalent. There are various reasons for the degradation, including crustaceans and the unregulated exploitation of wood. Efforts have been made to safeguard the mangroves and to educate children about their importance.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who knew him well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had {{come to grips with the}} physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an <b>environment</b> <b>where</b> people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could best be reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Xillia {{consists}} {{primarily of}} two major areas: the field map and the battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D <b>environment</b> <b>where</b> the player character traverses and interacts with non-player characters, items, or mob avatars. On the field map, character interactions between the party can also be viewed {{in the form of}} a sketch story; these sketch stories are referred to as skits and consist of animated portraits and voice acting. When coming into contact with a mob avatar, the environment switches to the battle screen, a 3D representation of an area in which the player commands the characters in battles against the CPU-controlled mobs.|$|E

5|$|The {{autonomous}} navigation of the Air-Cobot robot is in two phases. The first, navigation in {{the airport}} or the factory, allows the robot to move close to the aircraft. The second navigation, around the aircraft, allows the robot to position itself at control points referenced in the aircraft virtual model. In addition, the robot must insert itself in a dynamic <b>environment</b> <b>where</b> humans and vehicles are moving. To address this problem, it has an obstacle avoidance module. Many navigation algorithms are constantly running on the robot with real time constraints. Searches are conducted on optimizing the computing time.|$|E
5|$|The high {{population}} of the asteroid belt makes for a very active <b>environment,</b> <b>where</b> collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years. A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces (leading {{to the formation of}} a new asteroid family). Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.|$|E
5|$|Being {{chemically}} stable, neptunium phosphates {{have been}} investigated for potential use in immobilizing nuclear waste. Neptunium pyrophosphate (α-NpP2O7), a green solid, has been produced in the reaction between neptunium dioxide and boron phosphate at 1100°C, though neptunium(IV) phosphate has so far remained elusive. The series of compounds NpM2(PO4)3, where M is an alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs), are all known. Some neptunium sulfates have been characterized, both aqueous and solid and at various oxidation states of neptunium (IV through VI have been observed). Additionally, neptunium carbonates {{have been investigated}} to achieve {{a better understanding of}} the behavior of neptunium in geological repositories and the <b>environment,</b> <b>where</b> it may come into contact with carbonate and bicarbonate aqueous solutions and form soluble complexes.|$|E
