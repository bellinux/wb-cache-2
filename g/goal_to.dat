5|$|The Dubious Goals Committee has {{sometimes}} decided after a match that players have not scored hat-tricks {{because one of}} the goals was incorrectly credited to them. Southampton player Egil Østenstad was thought to have scored a hat-trick against Manchester United in 1996, but the committee ruled that one of the goals be credited as an own <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> United's Phil Neville.

40|$|ABSTRACT—Some {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} infants’ ability <b>to</b> reason about <b>goals</b> develops {{as a result of}} their experiences with human agents and is then gradually ex-tended to other agents. Other {{researchers have}} proposed that goal attribution is rooted in a specialized system of reasoning that is activated whenever infants encounter en-tities with appropriate features (e. g., self-propulsion). The first view predicts that young infants should attribute <b>goals</b> <b>to</b> human but not other agents; the second viewpredicts that young infants should attribute <b>goals</b> <b>to</b> both human and nonhuman agents. The present research revealed that 5 -month-old infants (the youngest found thus far <b>to</b> attribute <b>goals</b> <b>to</b> human agents) also attribute <b>goals</b> <b>to</b> nonhuman agents. Intwoexperiments, infants interpretedtheactionsof a self-propelled box as goal-directed. These results provid...|$|R

5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of {{legislation}} passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's <b>goal</b> <b>to</b> {{remove some of the}} entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.|$|E
