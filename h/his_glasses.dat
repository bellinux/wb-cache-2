5|$|Feit {{initially}} denied hearing Garza's confession in the rectory, but {{he later}} {{admitted to having}} done so. He accounted for his absence from the sanctuary by explaining that he had broken <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> that night; {{he said that he}} often played with <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> nervously as he listened to confession. Feit said that he had driven back to the pastoral house to get another pair of glasses, and when he arrived he had no key, so he had to climb into the house on the second floor. He said that he sustained the scratches on his hands as was climbing the outside of the brick structure.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad and {{the other}} prophets of Islam, bored of living in jannah (heaven) and weary of singing the praises of Allah, request {{permission}} to return to Earth. Disappointed by the prophets' request, Allah calls on Muhammad {{to explain why he}} wishes to return, as Allah had already granted him many things. Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research, to discover why so few Muslims are coming to heaven. Allah, after removing <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> responds that the people had been poisoned by Sukarno's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January 1976, {{a second}} UDR soldier, Sergeant James Roderick Shane McDowell (aged 29, an optical worker, also from Lurgan) {{was arrested and}} charged with the Miami killings. He served in C Company, 11th Battalion UDR. The RUC were led to him through <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> which had been found at the murder scene. Tests done on the glasses, which were {{eventually}} traced back to McDowell, revealed that the lenses were of a prescription worn by just 1 in 500,000 of the population.|$|E
60|$|He gave a boisterous laugh and, raising <b>his</b> <b>glass,</b> {{nodded to}} Mr. Stobell. Mr. Stobell, {{who was just}} about to drink, lowered <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> again and frowned.|$|R
6000|$|Ignatius Gallaher {{in the act}} of {{drinking}} closed one eye expressively over the rim of <b>his</b> <b>glass.</b> When he had drunk he smacked his lips decisively, set down <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> and said: ...|$|R
60|$|He plunged at <b>his</b> <b>glass.</b> <b>His</b> uncle's gaze relaxed its austerity.|$|R
5|$|The {{exterior}} iconography {{includes two}} notable whimsical elements. A downspout {{on the east}} wall features a relief of a bulldog head; a decades-old myth relates that Cram placed it there to recognize Yale University, whose mascot is the bulldog. (Cram was not a Yale alumnus and in fact did not attend college, so {{it is unclear what}} interest he might have had promoting Yale.) A sculptor who worked on the chapel during its construction placed small carvings of his face and Cram's at the bottoms of crockets flanking the main entrance; Cram is identifiable by <b>his</b> <b>glasses.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) teaches Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{about his}} {{favorite}} movie, Die Hard, {{and attempts to}} recite all the dialogue from memory while an impressed Erin checks his accuracy using an online transcript. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who is still away in the Caribbean after sailing his family's boat, emails Erin and {{says that he is}} going to stay for a few weeks. Hurt, Erin decides to watch Die Hard with Pete rather than just hear him quote it. While watching the movie, Erin begins to cry and Pete tries to comfort her by placing his arm around her. In the meantime, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) tells Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) about the Scranton Strangler case he was on. After boring her for what is implied to be several hours, she hushes him, before gently kissing him. Toby then whips off <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> and kisses her back.|$|E
5|$|Several {{thousand}} years ago, the planet Cybertron was consumed by {{a civil war}} between the two Transformer factions, the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron. Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark, a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet, into space, but Megatron pursued it. Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle and froze, and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky. Witwicky inadvertently activated Megatron’s navigational system, which etched the AllSpark’s coordinates into <b>his</b> <b>glasses.</b> The glasses {{end up in the}} possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky. In the present, Sam buys his first car, a rusting Chevrolet Camaro, but discovers it has a life of its own.|$|E
6000|$|He {{threw out}} the lees of <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> on the ground, so that they nearly spattered Cavalletto. This seemed to draw his {{attention}} to him anew. He set down <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> and said: ...|$|R
60|$|They {{looked at}} him in a puzzled manner. Then Milly leaned towards him and filled <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> with Wine. She touched <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> with her own, she even {{suffered}} her arm to rest upon his shoulder. For a single moment Mr. Waddington appeared to feel some instinct of aversion. He seemed almost about to draw away. Then the mood passed. He drew her towards him with a little burst of laughter, and raised <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> to <b>his</b> lips.|$|R
60|$|He {{threw back}} his head and the {{contents}} of <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> vanished. He set it down with a little smack of the lips. Once more he looked at the bottle. Frenhofer filled up <b>his</b> <b>glass,</b> but motioned to the door with his head.|$|R
5|$|Takamatsu is {{an honor}} student who has a polite {{personality}} and wears glasses. He mainly contributes to the SSS through intelligence gathering and other affairs but does not actively fight. Yuri herself says to not be fooled by <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> {{and that he is}} actually an idiot. Though appearing to be slender, he works out and is actually well-built muscle-wise. After he first reveals this, he tends to take his shirt off, much to everyone's discomfort. He is absorbed by a shadow and is turned into an NPC. However, having strong enough feelings (according to Yuri), he is able to regain his senses and manages to disappear like the others. He carries a Desert Eagle as a side-arm, but is also seen using a Sig 552.|$|E
5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, {{took off}} <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to {{put his arms around}} Blythe in an attempt to hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, knelt on him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E
25|$|Van Barneveld {{decided not}} to wear <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> {{in the first round}} of the 2015 World Championship and took out {{finishes}} of 167 and 170 in beating Rowby-John Rodriguez 3–0. He was then involved in three successive matches in which there was never a set between Van Barneveld and his opponent as he edged past Jamie Caven 4–3, Adrian Lewis 4–3 (Lewis missed one match dart) and Stephen Bunting 5–4. In the Bunting match he returned from a break after the fourth set with <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> on explaining afterwards that the board was looking blurry. Van Barneveld looked to have got himself back into his semi-final meeting with Phil Taylor when he recovered from 2–0 down to draw level, but his lengthy previous matches seemed to take effect as he could not win another set to be defeated 6–2. At the Masters he knocked out newly crowned world champion Gary Anderson 11–6 in the semi-finals, but was beaten by a reversal of this scoreline against Michael van Gerwen in the final.|$|E
6000|$|Burke's {{impulse was}} to give orders to go ahead at full speed, but he hesitated, and raised <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> to <b>his</b> eye. Then {{in a few moments}} he put down <b>his</b> <b>glass,</b> turned around, and shouted, [...] "That's the Monterey! The Monterey! and Captain Horn!" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin {{set down}} <b>his</b> <b>glass.</b> <b>His</b> steadfast gaze seemed to reduce Annette {{into a state}} of nervous panic.|$|R
6000|$|Presently he put <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> to <b>his</b> mouth, and {{of course}} found it empty. He looked puzzled, and glanced furtively and suspiciously {{out of the corner}} of his eye at a benignant and {{unconscious}} old lady who sat at his right. Shook his head, as much as to say, [...] "No, she couldn't have done it." [...] He tilted the corked bottle over <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> again, meantime searching around with his watery eye to see if anybody was watching him. He ate a few mouthfuls, raised <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> to <b>his</b> lips, {{and of course}} it was still empty. He bent an injured and accusing side-glance upon that unconscious old lady, which was a study to see. She went on eating and gave no sign. He took up <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> and <b>his</b> bottle, with a wise private nod of his head, and set them gravely on the left-hand side of his plate--poured himself another imaginary drink--went to work with his knife and fork once more--presently lifted <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> with good confidence, and found it empty, as usual.|$|R
25|$|Originally {{known for}} coming to council {{meetings}} in blue jeans with unkempt hair, Layton worked to change his image {{to run for mayor}} in the 1991 civic election. He also started wearing contact lenses, abandoning <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> and traded in his blue jeans for suits. In February 1991, Layton became the first official NDP candidate for the mayoralty, pitting him against centrist incumbent Art Eggleton. In a move that surprised many, Eggleton elected not to run again.|$|E
25|$|Rakes was {{swinging}} {{the flag and}} trying to hit him, not trying to spear him as it appears in the photo, and he narrowly missed. Landsmark was bloodied during the incident. An examination of all the photographs in the roll Forman shot reveals that Rakes missed Landsmark with the flag. Although anti-busing activist Jim Kelly appears to pin Landsmark's arms behind him, he is actually helping Landsmark to his feet. Kelly later positions himself between Landsmark and the other protestors to protect the lawyer. Landsmark had already been knocked to the ground, losing <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> and suffering a broken nose, {{by the time he}} got up the famous picture was taken.|$|E
25|$|Leonard's primary health {{concern is}} his lactose intolerance: his {{consuming}} melon or any dairy products (and {{according to the}} pilot episode, even corn) results in flatulence. Leonard wears eyeglasses because of astigmatism, and cannot see without them. On one occasion, when <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> were broken at the movie theater, he had to surreptitiously return to his apartment and retrieve his backup glasses. In order to avoid detection by a sick Sheldon and Penny, who was nursing him, Howard and Raj helped him to navigate {{through the living room}} by using a helmet camera. Leonard states in one episode that he suffers from sleep apnea. During his relationship with Leslie Winkle, he tells her that many members of his family have died from heart disease and thus he has a genetic disposition to the condition.|$|E
60|$|Sir Timothy passed <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> towards <b>his</b> {{proposed}} son-in-law.|$|R

25|$|As a cricketer, domesticity {{was just}} not in his line. He began his innings usually as one who, {{suffering}} from violent astigmatism, has not only mislaid <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> but had in addition a fearful headache. He made a pass or two after the ball had gone past him: he lunged fitfully and missed: he stabbed down just in time at the straight ones: he sliced the rising offside ball over the second slip: he snicked hazily past his leg stump. So, for {{about a quarter of}} an hour, it went on: or, to such an agonized onlooker as I, it seemed to go on. Then suddenly, he would catch a half volley or a long hop such a crack that the bowler, fearful of his own safety, lost all his aggressive intention, and, with it, any idea of length.|$|E
25|$|New York City Police Commissioner Julius Enderby is {{secretly}} {{a member}} of the Medievalists, a subversive anti-robot group which pines for the 'olden days' where men did not live in the 'caves of steel'. He uses his position to engineer meetings with Spacer Dr. Sarton under the guise of further cooperation, but he actually intends to destroy R. Daneel - who lives with and resembles Dr. Sarton. Enderby orders R. Sammy to bring a blaster through the unmonitored 'open air' (something that no Earthman could countenance), but {{in the heat of the}} moment Enderby drops <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> and fails to distinguish between the human and robot, accidentally shooting the human. Knowing that Baley's wife is also a Medievalist, he assigns Baley to the case, working with R. Daneel who represents the Spacers, and spreads a rumour about humanoid robots amongst the subversives to throw suspicion on Baley when Enderby later destroys R. Sammy with radiation. Furthermore, Daneel rules out Enderby as the murderer as his brain patterns show him incapable of deliberately killing.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 1861, Chase and an aide, Captain Ebenezer Farrand, {{formerly}} {{second in}} command at the Pensacola Navy Yard, appeared at Fort Pickens to demand the surrender of the fort and garrison. Slemmer and his {{second in command}}, Second Lieutenant J. H. Gilman, met Chase outside the fort. Slemmer refused to allow Chase and Farrand in the fort, even though Chase said he had built the fort and would learn nothing from entering it. Slemmer replied that Chase {{did not know what}} preparations he had made and Chase proceeded to state his business. Lieutenant Gilman reported that Chase said he wanted to avoid bloodshed and that he had written his demand in proper form and would read it. Lieutenant Gilman reported that Chase's voice shook and his eyes filled with tears as he began his demand that the U.S. Army surrender Fort Pickens, a structure that he had designed and built as a captain with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Chase handed the paper to Farrand to read but Farrand could not see it well at night without <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> so Gilman had to read it aloud.|$|E
60|$|The clergyman became solemn {{and looked}} {{steadily}} at <b>his</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{past one}} I think you mean," [...] said the Honourable George, turning {{from the group}} and eyeing the signora through <b>his</b> <b>glass.</b> The signora gave him back his own, as the saying is, and more with it, so that the young nobleman was forced to avert his glance and drop <b>his</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|R
60|$|Stephen raised <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> to <b>his</b> {{lips and}} drained its contents.|$|R
500|$|In {{the season}} 14 episode of The Simpsons, [...] "Strong Arms of the Ma", a postman is {{accident}}ally trapped under {{a car in}} front of the Simpson house. He intends to read The Twilight Zone Magazine but discovers that <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> were broken in the accident and says, [...] "That's not fair!", while the Twilight Zone main-theme music is heard in the background.|$|E
500|$|The Scary Door, a show-within-a-show on Futurama parodying The Twilight Zone, pokes fun at {{the final}} twist in [...] "Time Enough at Last". When {{the man in the}} episode loses <b>his</b> <b>glasses,</b> he realizes he can still read large print; his eyes fall out, but he {{declares}} he can read Braille; his hands fall off, and as he screams, his tongue falls out and then his head falls off. Bender comments, [...] "Cursed by his own hubris." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{talked to}} Yoko {{the day after}} he was killed, and the first thing she said was, [...] "John was really fond of you." [...] The last {{telephone}} conversation I had with him we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take <b>his</b> <b>glasses</b> down, those granny glasses, and say, [...] "it's only me." [...] They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.|$|E

60|$|Birkin, {{thinking}} about race or national death, watched <b>his</b> <b>glass</b> being filled with champagne. The bubbles broke at the rim, the man withdrew, and feeling a sudden thirst {{at the sight}} of the fresh wine, Birkin drank up <b>his</b> <b>glass.</b> A queer little tension in the room roused him. He felt a sharp constraint.|$|R
