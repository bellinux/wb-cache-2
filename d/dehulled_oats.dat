40|$|Results All mink {{and blue}} foxes {{maintained}} good health throughout both experiments. Mink In the digestibility trial mean final weights in mink (Figure 1) were equal in all diet groups (1846. 7 - 1908. 3 g), except the group <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats</b> 15 % {{where it was}} lower. In the production trial {{no statistically significant differences}} between treatments were found in weight gain (Figure 3). In the latter part of this experiment (November) mink fed 50 % <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats</b> gained even more than did the mink whose diet contained only barley as a cereal source. The differences in skin length, weight and characteristics were small and not significant (Table 3). Blue fox In the digestibility trial mean final weights of blue foxes were equal in all diets (Figure 1, 7355 - 7687 g). Average daily gain of blue foxes varied between 77. 4 - 81. 5 g. Final average weights varied from 13. 49 to 13. 75 kg (Figure 4). The differences in skin length, weight and characteristics were small (Table 4). Only quard hair quality, in the group 8 % <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats</b> became better than in other groups. Discussion Somewhat poorer weight gain in mink in the groups of 8 and 16 % <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats</b> did ot confirm the results of digestibility trial, where the difference in digestibility was not seen. The preliminary results of the digestibility trial show that both dehulled and naked oats diets were highly digestible. The difference may originate from looser and softer consistencys of <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats</b> diets. <b>Dehulled</b> <b>oats</b> finer particle size (2 mm) resulted in looser and softer consistency and probably led to feed waste from the wire mesh. The problem arose only with mink because the mink cages did not have feeding trays. In contrast, blue fox fed with the same experimental feed gained similarly to other diets. Van Barneveld et. al (1997) also studied digestibility of naked and <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats</b> in growing pigs and found that both dehulled and naked oats have very high amino acid digestibility. These results indicate that both naked and <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats</b> can promote good weight gain both in mink and blue foxes. Naked oats have been included in commercial young pigs diets with positive growth responses. Dehulled and naked oats have even been found very good feed ingredients for dogs. Amino acid content and profile oats is better than in corn Kempe et al. (2004). Our results, both digestibility data, growth and fur properties show that dehulled and naked oats are suitable ingredients in mink and blue fox diets. Naked oats is a new crop and not yet widely cultivated in Finland. Recent studies have shown that some varieties produce yields as high as common oats (Kangas et al., 2001). Hence, naked and <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats</b> will have a potential as a feed ingredient in fur bearing animal diets. References van Barneveld, R. J., Szarvas, S. R. and Barr, A. R. (1998).

40|$|Using ileal {{digestible}} {{amino acids}} in feed optimising will intensify feed protein utilizing and decrease nitrogen excretion to the environment. The study determined the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) coefficients of amino acids in barley, wheat, oats, triticale, maize, and <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats</b> in the diets of 180 Ross broiler chickens (aged 2435 days). The birds were fed semi-purified diets that contained grain {{as the sole}} protein source and chromium-mordanted straw as an indigestible marker. The AID coefficients of the nutrients were assessed using the slaughter technique, and the apparent metabolisable energy (AME) was determined using total excreta collection. The ileal digestibility of the dry matter and organic matter were the highest in maize. The AME of maize was {{higher than that of}} other cereals. The ileal digestibility of crude protein was higher in wheat than that in barley, oats and <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats.</b> The AME of wheat was similar to that of barley and oats but lower than that of triticale and <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats.</b> The amino acid AID was highest in wheat (0. 86) and triticale (0. 85) and lowest in oats (0. 79) and barley 0. 77). The average amino acid AID was 0. 81 in <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats.</b> The threonine AID was the same in all tested ingredients. The lysine, methionine, and cystine AID coefficients were 0. 81, 0. 79, and 0. 71 respectively for barley; 0. 86, 0. 84, and 0. 38 respectively for oats; 0. 87, 0. 86, and 0. 53 respectively for dehulled oats; 0. 84, 0. 90, and 0. 66 respectively for maize; 0. 89, 0. 88, and 0. 77 respectively for triticale; and 0. 87, 0. 85, and 0. 71 respectively for wheat. Results indicated that AME values of domestic grains (barley, oats and wheat) are in the same level. Especially, low AME value of wheat needs further investigation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} feeding various {{fractions}} of oats (whole oats, <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats</b> and oat hulls) in a wheat diet on the production, yolk cholesterol and yolk fatty acid concentrations of three strains of laying birds were studied for 12 weeks. There {{was no significant}} difference between birds fed the different oat fractions in weight gain, egg production, egg weight, daily cholesterol output or yolk concentration of palmitic, stearic or oleic acids or yolk unsaturated:saturated fatty acid ratio. Birds fed whole oat grain (WO) had lower yolk cholesterol concentration and content than those fed the wheat diet. Birds fed the <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats</b> (DO) diet significantly increased their yolk weight and yolk oleic to linoleic acid ratio when compared with those fed the WO. When oat hulls (OH) were substituted for some of the DO, birds significantly increased their yolk color and caused a nonsignificant reduction in their production parameters so that they were not significantly different from birds fed the WO diet. The addition of OH to a wheat based diet significantly increased feed consumption. There were differences among strains of birds in weight gain, feed consumption, rate of lay, egg weight, yolk weight, yolk color, and yolk cholesterol but not in egg mass, yolk fatty acid concentrations or daily cholesterol output. It was concluded that WO did not significantly alter egg production parameters or daily yolk cholesterol output but did significantly decrease yolk cholesterol concentration.

40|$|Optimal {{conditions}} for <b>dehulling</b> <b>oats</b> with an impact dehuller {{are affected by}} kernel size. Oat mills frequently separate oats according to kernel size before dehulling to optimize milling yields. Therefore, oat kernel size uniformity is of concern to oat milling operations. We have evaluated oat kernel size distributions by sequential sieving with slotted sieves and with digital image analysis. The use of slotted sieves is faster, less expensive, and less technically challenging. However, digital image analysis provides more detailed information. Graphical analyses of oat kernel size distributions indicate {{that they do not}} resemble normal Gaussian distributions, but rather appear bimodal or multi-modal. A statistical model was developed using likelihood analysis to determine whether a mixture of two subpopulations better describes oat kernel size distributions. The analysis estimates means, variances and numerical proportions of each putative subpopulation and calculates a bimodal coefficient which increases with increasing bimodality. Analysis of ten oat cultivars grown in five locations over three years indicated that all samples were better described by a bimodal model than by a normal distribution. The source of the bimodality {{is likely to be the}} architecture of the oat spikelet. Most oat spikelets contain two kernels, where the primary kernel is significantly larger than the secondary. Thus, the larger kernel subpopulation appears to be derived from primary kernels of double kernel spikelets and the smaller kernel subpopulation appears derived from the secondary kernels. The presence of single kernel spikelets and triple kernel spikelets tend to make the distributions less distinctly bimodal. Because of the non-uniform nature of the oat spikelet, it appears unlikely that a totally uniformly sized oat can easily be developed. However, selection based on the methods described here potentially could lead to more uniform kernel size distributions. We have found that the application of bimodal analysis to digital image analysis data can reliably estimate the mean sizes of primary and secondary kernels from double kernel spikelets. Significant variation in the bimodal coefficient was also found among the ten cultivars tested thus far, indicating the existence of selectable genetic variation for this trait. Greater kernel size uniformity should therefore be achievable selecting for low size differences between the primary and secondary kernels. vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelu...|$|R
40|$|Hulls, which {{dilute the}} {{nutritional}} quality of oats, {{are perhaps the}} most important reason why oats has been replaced by other cereals, like rice, corn, wheat and barley, in the nutrition of dogs. The high crude fibre and cellulose contents of hulls have negative effects on the dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, energy and mineral digestibilities (K, Na, Cl) of cereals in dogs (Fahey et al. 1992, Lewis et al. 1994, Kienzle et al. 2001). However, when dehulled, oat groats are superior to other cereals in digestible energy value and digestible crude protein value in dogs (Kempe et al. 2004). Also the digestibility of the main nutrients of oat groats are comparable to those of rice and better than in wheat, barley or corn (Kempe et al. 2004). The efficiency of dehulling is dependent on rotation speed of the dehuller. It is important that the nutritionally valuable kernels are intact after hulling process. To determine the effect of dehulling on apparent nutrient digestibilities and feed values for dogs, <b>oats</b> was <b>dehulled</b> at three different rotation speeds: 200, 300 and 400 rpm using small laboratory dehuller. The oat groats were heat treated in a flower mill with indirect steam (160 oC, 30 min). A digestibility trial was carried out in metabolism cages on eight female Alaskan huskies according to a replicated 4 × 4 Williams square design. <b>Dehulling</b> the <b>oats</b> at the rotation speed 300 rmp increased the faecal digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude fibre, N-free extract, crude carbohydrates and gross energy compared to low rotation speed. High rotation speed 400 rpm did not induce further increase in the nutrient digestibility, except dry matter and crude carbohydrates. Digestibility of crude protein, fat and starch were unaffected by the treatment and were an average 82 %, 87 % and 99 %, respectively. However, the amount of digestible protein (DCP) and energy (DE) increased when dehulling level increased: 121, 134 and and 140 g DCP kg- 1 DM and 15. 1, 16. 7 and 17. 0 MJ DE kg- 1 DM, respectively.

40|$|Abstract—Malting {{is usually}} {{carried out on}} intact barley seed, while hull is still {{attached}} to it. In this study, oat grain with and without hull was subjected to controlled germination to optimize its enzymes activity, {{in such a way}} that lipase has the lowest and α-amylase and proteinase the highest activities. Since pH has a great impact on the activity of the enzymes, the pH of germination media was set up to 3 to 8. In <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats,</b> lipase and α-amylase had the lowest and highest activities in pHs 3 and 6, respectively whereas the highest proteinase activity was evidenced at pH 7 and 4 in the oats with and without hull respectively. While measurements indicated that the effect of hull on the enzyme activities particularly in lipase and amylase at each level of the pH are significantly different, the best results were obtained in those samples in which their hull had been removed. However, since the similar lipase activity in germinated dehulled oat were recorded at the pHs 4 and 5, therefore it was concluded that pH 5 in dehulled oat seed may provide the optimum enzyme activity for all the enzymes. o Keywords—Enzyme activity, malting, oat, optimization...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, 15 {{dehulled}} and 15 naked oats {{were used for}} a comparative analysis of macronutrients, β-glucan, free (FPs) and bound (BPs) polyphenols and avenanthramides (AVNs). The naked and dehulled oat cultivar samples (cvs.) did not show any significant difference in protein and lipid percentages and only small differences in starch. As regard the β-glucan, {{no significant difference in}} the average values between naked and dehulled cvs. was observed. Concerning polyphenols, BPs showed higher levels than FPs, but the antioxidant capacity (ORAC) of the FPs was superior to that of the BPs. Naked oats showed a concentration of AVN that was three fold higher than that of <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats.</b> Regarding the storage, AVNs resulted to be the most sensitive non-caloric nutrients to storage conditions, as a depletion was detected in most of the analyzed cvs. Overall, our results suggested that there is a great variability, in term of AVN content, between naked and dehulled oat cvs. and that storage conditions must be adapted for groups of cvs. in order to reduce their loss. Moreover, high levels of β-glucan found in some cvs. may help us to develop commodities, which meet the EFSA requirements for health claims...|$|E
40|$|In vivo and {{in vitro}} {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine digestibility of GE and nutrients, as well as DE and ME of carbohydrates fed to growing pigs. The objective of Exp. 1 {{was to determine the}} DE and ME of 4 novel carbohydrates fed to pigs. The 4 novel carbohydrates were 2 sources of resistant starch (RS 60 and RS 70), soluble corn fiber (SCF), and pullulan. These carbohydrates were produced to increase total dietary fiber (TDF) intake by humans. Maltodextrin (MD) was used as a highly digestible control carbohydrate. The DE and ME for RS 60 (1, 779 and 1, 903 kcal/kg, respectively), RS 75 (1, 784 and 1, 677 kcal/kg, respectively), and SCF (1, 936 and 1, 712 kcal/kg, respectively) were less (P < 0. 05) than for MD (3, 465 and 3, 344 kcal/kg, respectively) and pullulan (2, 755 and 2, 766 kcal/kg, respectively), and pullulan contained less (P < 0. 05) DE and ME than MD. However, {{there was no difference in}} the DE and ME for RS 60, RS 75, and SCF. The varying degrees of small intestinal digestibility and differences in fermentability among these novel carbohydrates may explain the differences in the DE and ME among carbohydrates. Therefore, the objectives of Exp. 2 were to determine the effect of these 4 novel carbohydrates and cellulose on apparent ileal (AID) and apparent total tract (ATTD) disappearance, and hindgut disappearance (HGD) of GE, TDF, and nutrients when added to diets fed to ileal-cannulated pigs. The second objective was to measure the endogenous flow of TDF to be able to calculate the standardized ileal disappearance (SID) and standardized total tract (STTD) disappearance of TDF in the 4 novel fibers fed to pigs. Results of the experiment indicated that the AID of GE and DM in diets containing cellulose or the novel fibers was less (P < 0. 05) than of the maltodextrin diet, but the ATTD of GE and DM was not different among diets. The addition of RS 60, RS 75, and SCF did not affect the AID of acid hydrolysed ether extract (AEE), CP, or ash, but the addition of cellulose and pullulan reduced (P < 0. 01) the AID of CP. The average ileal and total tract endogenous losses of TDF were calculated to be 25. 25 and 42. 87 g/kg DMI, respectively. The SID of TDF in diets containing RS 60, SCF, and pullulan were greater (P < 0. 01) than the SID of TDF in the cellulose diet, but the STTD of the SCF diet was greater (P < 0. 05) than for the cellulose and pullulan diets. Results of this experiment indicate that the presence of TDF reduces small intestinal disappearance of total carbohydrates and energy which may reduce the DE and ME of diets and ingredients. Therefore, the objective of Exp. 3 was to determine the DE and ME in yellow dent corn, Nutridense corn, dehulled barley, <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats,</b> polished rice, rye, sorghum, and wheat fed to growing pigs and to determine the AID and ATTD of GE, OM, CP, AEE, starch, total carbohydrates, and TDF in these cereal grains fed to pigs. Results indicated that the AID of GE, OM, and total carbohydrates was greater (P < 0. 001) in rice than in all other cereal grains. The AID of starch was also greater (P < 0. 001) in rice than in yellow dent corn, dehulled barley, rye, and wheat. The ATTD of GE was greater (P < 0. 001) in rice than in yellow dent corn, rye, sorghum, and wheat. With a few exceptions, the AID and ATTD of GE and nutrients in Nutridense corn was not different from the values for <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats.</b> Likewise, with a few exceptions, the AID, ATTD, and HGD of GE, OM, total carbohydrates, and TDF in yellow corn, sorghum, and wheat were not different from each other. The AID of GE and AEE in dehulled barley was greater (P < 0. 001) than in rye. The ATTD of GE and most nutrients was greater (P < 0. 001) in dehulled barley than in rye. <b>Dehulled</b> <b>oats</b> had the greatest (P < 0. 001) ME (kcal/kg DM) whereas rye had the least ME (kcal/kg DM) among the cereal grains. Results of the experiment indicate that the presence of TDF and RS may reduce small intestinal digestibility of starch in cereal grains resulting in reduced DE and ME in these grains. Digestibility experiments involving animals are time consuming and expensive. Therefore, the objective of Exp. 4 was to correlate DM and OM digestibility obtained from 3 in vitro procedures with ATTD of GE and with the concentration of DE in 50 corn samples that were fed to growing pigs. The second objective was to develop a regression model that can predict the ATTD of GE or the concentration of DE in corn. The third objective was to evaluate the suitability of using the DaisyII incubator as an alternative to the traditional water bath when determining in vitro DM and OM digestibility. Results indicated that corn samples incubated with Viscozyme for 48 h in the DaisyII incubator improved (P < 0. 001) the ability of the procedure to detect small differences in the ATTD of GE or to detect small differences in the concentration of DE in corn. Likewise, compared with using cellulase or fecal inoculum, the variability in the ATTD of GE and the variability in the DE in corn was better (R 2 = 0. 56; P < 0. 05 and R 2 = 0. 53; P < 0. 06, respectively) explained if Viscozyme was used than if cellulase or fecal inoculum was used. A validated regression model that predicted the DE in corn was developed using Viscozyme and with the corn samples incubated in the DaisyII incubator for a 48 h. 	In conclusion, this present work used the pig as a model for human gastrointestinal function and evaluates carbohydrates from 2 different nutritional perspectives – humans and animals. The addition of novel carbohydrates reduced the digestibility of energy in the diets without necessarily reducing the digestibility of other nutrients. Thus, supplementation of novel carbohydrates in the diets may be beneficial for the management of diabetes. Aside from diabetic management, cereal grains such as rye and sorghum, may also help in BW management because of there low caloric value, but for undernourished individuals, <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats,</b> dehulled barley, and rice are the ideal grains. From an animal nutrition standpoint, high concentration of dietary fiber is undesirable because it reduces feed efficiency. Therefore, the inclusion of feed ingredients that have a high concentration of dietary fiber is often limited in animal diets. Although in vivo determination is ideal, in vitro procedures are useful tools to determine caloric value of food and feed ingredients...|$|E
40|$|Instant fried noodles {{have become}} one of the food {{products}} regularly consumed among people of all socioeconomic levels in both urban and rural areas. Oat bran is rich in β-glucan, a soluble fiber in oat. The objective {{of this study was to}} utilize oat bran, produced from <b>dehulled</b> <b>oats</b> by dry milling and cooking extrusion to improve the nutritional quality of wheat noodle and to evaluate the noodle quality. Three types of oat bran concentrate (OBC) : OBCXF, OBCXEF, OBC native were used to replace wheat flour in noodle production, each type at the levels of 5, 10, and 15 % (w/w). The experimental design was 3 × 3 factorial randomized complete block design. The flours and products were analyzed for moisture, protein, fat, β- glucan, RVA and color. The texture of the products was determined using texture analyzer and sensory test. Protein contents of OBCXF, XEF, native and wheat flour were 22. 05, 23. 21, 22. 00 and 13. 16 %, respectively. OBC β-glucan content was 16 - 17 %. Increasing the amount of various OBC in the mixes caused the increase in protein content and β-glucan in the products. The texture of the noodles with 5 % replacement with OBC was not significantly different from that of wheat noodle. The tensile force was in the range of 17. 10 - 17. 96 g. The sensory acceptability of the noodles replaced with 5 - 10 % OBC was not significantly different from wheat noodle (p< 0. 05). Noodle with 10 % OBC-XEF had the highest scores in texture, elasticity and accept- ability. Thus, instant fried noodle having its wheat partially replaced with 10 - 15 % OBC contained β-glucan in the range of 0. 80 - 1. 27 g/serving (50 g), which met the FDA approved health claim which requires 0. 75 g/ serving, and contained dietary fiber in the range of 3. 0 - 4. 5 g/serving. By using 10 - 15 % OBC in the formulation, it was possible to satisfactorily make instant fried noodles...|$|E
