5|$|The lack of {{good public}} housing, poor sanitation, and high {{unemployment}} led to social problems from crime to health issues. The proliferation of squatter settlements resulted in safety hazards and caused the Bukit Ho Swee Fire in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless. The Housing Development Board set up before independence {{continued to be}} largely successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable public housing to resettle the squatters. Within a decade, {{the majority of the}} population had been housed in these apartments. The Central Provident Fund (CPF) <b>Housing</b> <b>Scheme,</b> introduced in 1968, allows residents to use their compulsory savings account to purchase HDB flats and gradually increases home ownership in Singapore.|$|E
40|$|Homeownership is {{a problem}} among younger working {{households}} (YWH). This is a more serious problem with YWH working in urban areas. New <b>housing</b> <b>schemes</b> introduced by the government show that measures are being taken. This paper aims to determine homeownership problems among YWH {{in order to assess}} the new <b>housing</b> <b>schemes</b> towards helping YWH. The questions arise are what are the homeownership problems among YWH and to what extent does YWH perceive the new <b>housing</b> <b>schemes</b> to help them. The objectives are to ascertain homeownership problems among YWH and to explore the perceptions of YWH on the new <b>housing</b> <b>schemes</b> introduced. The study was conducted qualitatively through in-depth interviews with YWH. The findings showed that the main homeownership problem highlighted by the YWH is housing prices are high in urban area which resulted to the location of affordable houses inconvenient. From the assessment, majority of the YWH agree with the new <b>housing</b> <b>schemes.</b> However there are weaknesses such as high land prices and absence of financial literacy. In conclusion, <b>housing</b> <b>schemes</b> should also consider financial education as part of their aims. Nevertheless, the introduction of <b>housing</b> <b>schemes</b> is beneficial to address homeownership problems among YWH...|$|R

25|$|Michael Joseph Savage, {{leader of}} the Labour Party, became Prime Minister on 6 December 1935, marking the {{beginning}} of Labour's first term in office.

Savage himself was highly popular with the working classes, and his portrait could be found on the walls of many houses around the country.

25|$|The Housing Development Board set {{up before}} {{independence}} {{continued to be}} largely successful under Lim Kim San.

It was remarkable that, within a decade, {{the majority of the population}} had been housed in HDB apartments. Possible explanations for the otherwise seemingly impossible success was the determination of the government, the large budget allocations, and efforts to eliminate red tape and corruption.

The club was also forced to move home in 1936 when the Glasgow Corporation {{exercised}} a compulsory purchase order on Barrowfield Park in order to construct a new <b>housing</b> <b>scheme</b> (also called Barrowfield) on the land. Waverley identified a new site at Westthorn on the boundary of Parkhead, Dalmarnock and Braidfauld adjacent to Belvidere Hospital. This ground was named New Barrowfield, meaning there were three different football venues known by that name, albeit the others no longer existed. The move brought the club into even closer proximity with Strathclyde (whose Springfield Park ground {{was on the other}} side of the hospital) and Parkhead (whose Helenslea Park was just yards away across London Road). Parkhead Stadium railway station was nearby.|$|E
25|$|John Carthy {{was born}} the only son of John and Rose Carthy on 9 October 1972. He had one sister, Marie, who was two years his junior. He was an avid Handballer and member of Abbeylara Handball Club. His father, with whom he was very close, died on 12 April 1990. In 1992 John was {{diagnosed}} with clinical depression and, subsequently with bipolar affective disorder. John's general employment was in the construction industry. He resided with his mother in an old, three-bedroom house in Toneymore, Abbeylara. She and John were due to move from this old house to a new home which had been built on their land by Longford County Council {{as part of a}} rural <b>housing</b> <b>scheme.</b> The old house was due to be demolished. On 19 April 2000, the day prior to his death, John stayed in the family home all day with his mother. His mother's testimony to the Barr Tribunal indicated that John was very hostile to the move and that this was the primary topic of their discussions that day.|$|E
25|$|Farnborough Road and the {{immediate}} area became a hive of construction activity in CVHAT's existence. A self-build scheme was pioneered here by Birmingham Co-operative Housing Services and Accord Housing Association. Starting in May 2008, the scheme involved the construction of 14 mock-Tudor style homes by their future tenants. At the project's outset, {{those involved in the}} construction of the buildings were unemployed but had gained full-time jobs by the project's completion. Another construction project was Farnborough Road children's home, the first children's home in the city for 20 years. The eight-bed centre was constructed as a result of a partnership between Birmingham's Social Services Department, CVHAT, Walker Troup Architects, and design and build contractor Lovell Partnerships. The children's home was part of a larger <b>housing</b> <b>scheme</b> by Lovell Partnerships and designed by Walker Troup Architects which proved to be the last large-scale residential construction project for the HAT. The scheme consisted of 237 homes, of which, 211 were for rent and 26 were offered for sale in the scheme which cost £22.7 million. Construction commenced in October 2002.|$|E
