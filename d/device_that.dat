5|$|PING asks {{a device}} {{if it is}} ready to receive an OUT/DATA packet pair. PING is usually sent by a host when polling a <b>device</b> <b>that</b> most {{recently}} responded with NAK or NYET. This avoids the need to send a large data packet to a <b>device</b> <b>that</b> the host suspects to be unwilling to accept it. The device responds with ACK, NAK, or STALL, as appropriate.|$|E
5|$|An air well or aerial well is a {{structure}} or <b>device</b> <b>that</b> collects water by promoting the condensation of moisture from air. Designs for air wells are many and varied, but the simplest designs are completely passive, require no external energy source and have few, if any, moving parts.|$|E

5000|$|Class III: <b>Devices</b> <b>that</b> are {{approved}} by the Premarket Approval (PMA) process, analogous to a New Drug Application. These tend to be <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> are permanently implanted into a human body or {{may be necessary to}} sustain life. An artificial heart meets both criteria. The most commonly recognized class III device is an Automated External Defibrillator. <b>Devices</b> <b>that</b> do not meet either criterion are generally cleared as class II devices.|$|R
50|$|DVD drives are <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> {{can read}} DVD discs on a computer. DVD players are a {{particular}} type of <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> do not require a computer to work, and can read DVD-Video and DVD-Audio discs.|$|R
3000|$|There {{are several}} kinds of {{resampling}} methods, and the basic resampling method is called the single distribution resampling. Furthermore, single distribution resampling is subdivided into two categories called: traditional variation resampling and traditional resampling. Using traditional resampling benefits computing <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> need a single sampling process for every [...] j [...] cycle (for instance, computing <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> only have low memory requirements). On the other hand, the utilisation of traditional variation resampling is beneficial for computing <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> require {{more than a single}} sampling process for every j cycle (for instance, computing <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> have a high memory requirement). Although computing <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> have high memory requirement do not normally have problems with memory consumption, traditional variation resampling is often thought to be more appropriate for usage in this environment because it is faster than traditional resampling [58].|$|R
5|$|A bus-powered hub is a {{high-power}} device providing low-power ports. It draws 1 {{unit load}} for the hub controller and 1 unit load {{for each of}} at most 4 ports. The hub may also have some non-removable functions in place of ports. A self-powered hub is a <b>device</b> <b>that</b> provides high-power ports. Optionally, the hub controller draw power for its operation as a low-power device, but all high-power ports draw from the hub's self-power.|$|E
5|$|After the {{introduction}} of decapoint, Braille gave assistance to his friend Pierre-François-Victor Foucault, who {{was working on the}} development of his Raphigraphe, a <b>device</b> <b>that</b> could emboss letters {{in the manner of a}} typewriter. Foucault's machine was hailed as a great success and was exhibited at the World's Fair in Paris in 1855.|$|E
5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit. Such cigars are normally packed with a minute chemical explosive charge near the lighting end or with a non-chemical <b>device</b> <b>that</b> ruptures the cigar when exposed to heat. The customary intended purpose of exploding cigars is {{as a form of}} hostile practical joke, rather than to cause lasting physical harm to the butt of the joke. Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E
5000|$|In the past, the {{protection}} model that most organizations applied {{to protect their}} infrastructure was simply the [...] "Everything but the Kitchen Sink" [...] model—meaning, add <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> protect the enterprise network perimeter (Trusted Zone), add <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> protect your mobile <b>device,</b> add <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> protect your database. In essence, this model simply advocated for the accumulation of security devices. As we pointed out earlier, see section 1.0, this model has failed.|$|R
5000|$|Interventions for {{children}} with permanent congenital hearing loss ranges from <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> amplify sound (e.g., hearing aids) to <b>devices</b> <b>that</b> replace the function of a damaged inner ear (cochlear implants) to communication modalities including spoken language, sign language, and Cued Speech.|$|R
25|$|Although human {{morphology}} is {{not necessarily}} the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: simulacra (<b>devices</b> <b>that</b> exhibit likeness) and automata (<b>devices</b> <b>that</b> have independence).|$|R
5|$|Each {{level in}} the game is {{intended}} to have a unique theme, in either fiction or game mechanic. In one level, the player is confronted with two factions each with their own assassination target, and may use the level's reoccurring dust storms for cover. In another, time distortion is introduced as the player traverses an abandoned mansion in ruins. The player is given a <b>device</b> <b>that</b> lets them glimpse three years into the past, where the mansion is still occupied and guards roam, and can shift {{back and forth between}} the two points in time.|$|E
5|$|In 1650, German {{scientist}} Otto von Guericke {{constructed the}} first vacuum pump: a <b>device</b> <b>that</b> would further refute {{the principle of}} horror vacui. He correctly noted that {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the density gradually declining with altitude. He concluded that there must be a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E
5|$|In April 2013, Nokia {{was granted}} a {{preliminary}} injunction in the Netherlands against STMicroelectronics, which had supplied HTC with microphone components for the <b>device</b> <b>that</b> contained Nokia’s proprietary technology. Despite the injunction being against STM, Nokia still used the injunction to publicly accuse HTC of copying technology from its products. HTC would {{still be able to}} use the remaining microphones it acquired in good faith; the offending component was replaced with an alternative version in future production runs.|$|E

5|$|In his Poetics, Aristotle {{points to}} the ″voice of the shuttle″ in Sophocles′ tragedy Tereus {{as an example of}} a poetic <b>device</b> <b>that</b> aids in the ″recognition″—the change from ignorance to knowledge—of what has {{happened}} earlier in the plot. Such a device, according to Aristotle, is ″contrived″ by the poet, and thus is ″inartistic.″. The connection between the nightingale's song and poetry is evoked by Aristophanes in his comedy The Birds and in the poetry of Callimachus. Roman poet Virgil compares the mourning of Orpheus for Eurydice to the “lament of the nightingale”.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{copies of}} the album were shipped out in black body bags, a promotional <b>device</b> <b>that</b> drew minor criticism. The album debuted at No. 32 on Billboards Top 50 albums, peaking at No. 26 on the Billboard 200. By January 29, 1993, the album sold 480,000 copies, {{according}} to Variety. However, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, Body Count was certified gold for sale shipments in excess of 500,000 copies, with a certification date back to August 4, 1992.|$|E

5|$|PlayStation VR is {{a virtual}} reality <b>device</b> <b>that</b> is {{produced}} by Sony Computer Entertainment. It features a 5.7 inch 1920x1080 resolution OLED display, and operates at 120fps which can eliminate blur and produce a smooth image; the device also has a low latency of less than 18ms. Additionally, it produces two sets of images, one being visible on a TV {{and one for the}} headset, and includes 3D audio technology so the player can hear from all angles. The PlayStation VR was released in October 2016.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo {{created a}} neutron source using radium and beryllium, as the Via Panisperna boys had, with {{paraffin}} wax as a neutron moderator, and measured {{the absorption of}} different minerals using methods developed by Fermi and Amaldi. By June 1941, he had a <b>device</b> <b>that</b> could differentiate shale, limestone and sandstone, and map the transitions between them. The technique may be considered the first practical application {{of the discovery of}} slow neutrons, and would still be in use decades later for well logging. He filed four patents relating to his instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{national}} standards {{require that the}} cylinder valve includes a bursting disk, a pressure relief <b>device</b> <b>that</b> will release the gas before the cylinder fails {{in the event of}} overpressurization. If a bursting disk ruptures during a dive the entire contents of the cylinder will be lost in a very short time. The risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc, in good condition, on a correctly filled cylinder is very low.|$|E
