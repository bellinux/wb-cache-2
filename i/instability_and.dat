40|$|It {{is argued}} that {{familiar}} nonlinear instabilities, such as three-wave decay <b>instabilities</b> <b>and</b> scattering off quasi-modes, have reactive and resistive versions.

Using a simplified model it is shown that the reactive version passes over into the resistive version when the band-width of the pump is comparable with the growth rate. 1...|$|R

The work was canceled in November 1942, however, after design problems, including serious <b>instability</b> <b>and</b> structural weaknesses, proved to be irreconcilable. No work was done on the ship, which was eventually seized by the US Army and used as a troop transport following the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and summer, {{conditions}} along {{the east coast of}} Australia are highly conducive for the formation of hailstorms. The variation of air temperature in the atmosphere; with warm and humid air close to the ground and colder air above it causes <b>instability,</b> <b>and</b> the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones. Since records began in 1791, hailstorms in the month of January form approximately 13% {{of the total number of}} hailstorms in the Sydney metropolitan area, and over 15% of all events with 'large hail'.|$|E

5|$|Once fusion begins, the {{temperature}} of the white dwarf increases. A main sequence star supported by thermal pressure can expand and cool which automatically regulates the increase in thermal energy. However, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature; white dwarfs are unable to regulate temperature in the manner of normal stars, so they are vulnerable to runaway fusion reactions. The flare accelerates dramatically, in part due to the Rayleigh–Taylor <b>instability</b> <b>and</b> interactions with turbulence. It is still a matter of considerable debate whether this flare transforms into a supersonic detonation from a subsonic deflagration.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 Groundhog Day tornado {{outbreak}} was a localized but devastating tornado {{event that}} took place in central Florida early on February 2, 2007. Early morning temperatures had risen well above average for the season; combined with increased moisture and a powerful jet stream, this created enough <b>instability</b> <b>and</b> wind shear for thunderstorms to rotate and spawn tornadoes. Due to the conditions, a long-tracked supercell formed and produced three tornadoes over one hour and seventeen minutes. The supercell resulted in a 70-mile (110-kilometer) trail of damage.|$|E
5|$|The Achaean League {{chose this}} moment to fight Rome but was swiftly defeated.

40|$|We numerically {{study the}} {{symmetry}} breaking instabilities of vortex patterns in a rotating harmonic potential using {{a type of}} Ginzburg-Landau equation.

The symmetry-breaking <b>instabilities</b> <b>and</b> the <b>instabilities</b> of vortex nucleation determine the parameter region of stable vortex patterns.

5|$|The {{media and}} {{international}} think-tanks have highlighted the country's <b>instability</b> <b>and</b> labelled it a narcostate.

Guinea-Bissau's instability is also exacerbated as a transit point for drug shipments from Latin America to Europe and there are allegations that government ministers and military personnel are bribed to keep silent.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} form as {{a result}} of significant convective activity, and are warm core. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation.

Cyclolysis is the opposite of cyclogenesis, and is the high-pressure system equivalent, which deals with the formation of high-pressure areas—Anticyclogenesis.|$|E
