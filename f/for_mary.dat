5|$|From {{the early}} fourteenth century, Melbourne Castle was {{mainly in the}} {{possession}} of the Earls and Dukes of Lancaster or the crown. Improvements and repairs were made, notably by John of Gaunt, and the building was in generally good condition throughout the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. John I, Duke of Bourbon, was kept at Melbourne for 19 years after his capture at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and the castle was considered as a possible prison <b>for</b> <b>Mary,</b> Queen of Scots, although events led to her incarceration elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|As Emma, Mary Margaret, and Graham {{search the}} wooded area for John Doe, they {{are joined by}} Henry. Henry {{believes}} that the patient is looking <b>for</b> <b>Mary</b> Margaret. They soon discover the patient lying near the bridge seen in the fairytale flashback, and Mary Margaret revives him. As they take {{him back to the}} hospital, Regina shows up with a woman named Kathryn (Griffith), and states that she is his wife and that the patient's name is David Nolan. This devastates Mary Margaret, as she had begun to develop feelings for the patient. Emma becomes suspicious of Regina's ability to find Nolan's wife and questions why Kathryn never bothered to search for him before. Although Regina claims that past hospital surveillance tapes had David mentioning Kathryn's name in his sleep, Emma still believes that Regina is lying. Later that evening, Emma arrives at Mary Margaret's place and agrees to take up the offer of staying with the teacher.|$|E
5|$|Despite his affection <b>for</b> <b>Mary,</b> Henry {{was deeply}} {{disappointed}} that his marriage had produced no sons. By the time Mary {{was nine years}} old, {{it was apparent that}} Henry and Catherine would have no more children, leaving Henry without a legitimate male heir. In 1525, Henry sent Mary to the border of Wales to preside, presumably in name only, over the Council of Wales and the Marches. She was given her own court based at Ludlow Castle and many of the royal prerogatives normally reserved for the Prince of Wales. Vives and others called her the Princess of Wales, although she was never technically invested with the title. She appears to have spent three years in the Welsh Marches, making regular visits to her father's court, before returning permanently to the home counties around London in mid-1528.|$|E

5|$|Later {{on in the}} day, Mary Margaret finds a dove in {{the forest}} trapped in some wire mesh. The town vet (Kwesi Ameyew) at the shelter where David works tells her the bird will be okay but only if she returns to her flock. David offers to help Mary Margaret return the dove but she declines. He follows her anyway {{and is able to}} save her from falling off a cliff. It starts to pour so the two take shelter in an empty cabin. David asks Mary Margaret what is wrong and she admits she still has {{feelings}} for him, and he is the reason she goes to Granny's at 7:15. David replies that he goes to Granny's to see her. They nearly kiss but Mary Margaret stops it because she knows about Kathryn's pregnancy test. David explains that his feelings for Kathryn are memories but his feelings <b>for</b> <b>Mary</b> Margaret are real. She says they have to forget each other.|$|E
5|$|Mary sent William Maitland of Lethington as an {{ambassador}} to the English court to put the case <b>for</b> <b>Mary</b> as the heir presumptive to the English throne. Elizabeth refused to name a potential heir, fearing that {{to do so would}} invite conspiracy to displace her with the nominated successor. However, Elizabeth assured Maitland that she knew no one with a better claim than Mary. In late 1561 and early 1562, arrangements were made for the two queens to meet in England at York or Nottingham in August or September 1562, but Elizabeth sent Sir Henry Sidney to cancel in July because of the civil war in France.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} influences on History of a Six Weeks' Tour was Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), written by Mary Shelley's mother Mary Wollstonecraft. A travel narrative that reflects on topography, politics, society, aesthetics, and the author's personal feelings, it provided a model <b>for</b> <b>Mary</b> Shelley's work. Like her mother, Mary Shelley revealed her liberalism by boldly discussing politics; however, this political tone was unusual for travel works at the time and was considered inappropriate for women writers. Like Wollstonecraft's Letters, History of a Six Weeks' Tour blurs the line between private and public spheres by using intimate genres such as the journal and the letter, allowing Mary Shelley to present political opinions through personal anecdote and the picturesque.|$|E

No mention is made of any fetal remains being found in Mary's body or in Spencer's office.|$|R
5|$|Since the Restoration, {{there have}} been many {{additions}} and alterations to the regalia. A new set of regalia was commissioned in 1685 <b>for</b> <b>Mary</b> of Modena, the first queen consort to be crowned since the Restoration, CharlesII having been unmarried when he took the throne. Another, more elaborate set had to be made four years later when MaryII was crowned as joint sovereign with her husband WilliamIII. After the Acts of Union 1707 joined England and Scotland together, the Scottish Crown Jewels were locked away in a chest, and the English Crown Jewels continued to be used by British monarchs. Starting with Queen Anne, gemstones were hired for coronations and replaced with paste and crystals for display in the Jewel House, a practice which continued until the early 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Jewels {{include two}} sceptres {{originally}} made <b>for</b> <b>Mary</b> of Modena, {{the wife of}} JamesII, in 1685: a gold sceptre with a cross known as the Queen Consort's Sceptre with Cross and another topped by a dove known as the Queen Consort's Ivory Rod with Dove, which, as the name suggests, is made of ivory. Unlike the sovereign's dove, this one has folded wings and is relatively small. It was last used by Queen Elizabeth, later known as the Queen Mother, at the coronation of her husband GeorgeVI in 1937. For the coronation of MaryII, the wife and joint sovereign of WilliamIII, a more elaborate gold sceptre with dove was commissioned in 1689. It has not been used since, and went missing for several decades, only {{to be found in}} 1814 at the back of a cupboard in the Tower of London.|$|E
5|$|While Theophilus Cibber was disputing with Highmore and Ellys, Aaron Hill became {{interested}} in partnering at the Theatre Royal. Hill was earlier a partner at the theatre until he was removed during a previous actor riot {{that took place in}} June 1710. On 22 March 1733, Hill, in a letter to Benjamin Victor, a dramatist who had arranged the sale of Booth's shares to Highmore, criticised {{the fact that he was}} kept from buying into the theatre's management and attacked Theophilus. He offered 900 pounds for three years for Booth's shares and 1800 pounds <b>for</b> <b>Mary</b> Wilks's shares. Negotiations continued until May when they were dropped. Hester Booth, widow of Barton Booth, sold her remaining shares to Henry Giffard, the manager of Goodman's Fields Theatre, just few days after her husband died on 10 May.|$|E
40|$|This article reconsiders Mary Tudor's {{victory in}} the {{succession}} crisis of July 1553. It challenges the traditional interpretation which accounts <b>for</b> <b>Mary's</b> unexpected triumph {{as the result of}} a 'spontaneous' rising of the East Anglian gentry. Instead it reclaims a central role <b>for</b> <b>Mary's</b> household affinity in the succession crisis and as such presents a longer-term perspective than accounts of Mary's coup d'Ã©tat have provided hitherto. It concludes by pointing to the implications of the role of <b>Mary's</b> household <b>for</b> interpreting the politics and religion of her reign.

5|$|After Cain's disappearance, Mary becomes {{head of the}} Hargreaves. Augusta {{possesses}} Alexis, {{and seeks}} out Mary in the mausoleum Cain had built before leaving to confront Alexis. Augusta reveals that she manipulated Alexis into abusing his sons and trying to resurrect her for her amusement. Before she can kill Mary, Augusta triggers Cain's trap in the mausoleum and dies. Years later, Mary is married to Oscar and pregnant with their child, although she still waits for his return. Crehador, a medium close to Cain, sets up a tea party <b>for</b> <b>Mary,</b> fulfilling Cain's promise; he then reminisces on how he found Cain being held by Riff's corpse within the ruined tower. The bunkoban-exclusive epilogue expands the ending slightly. It shows an elderly Mary, who lies on her deathbed attended by a woman nearby and hears the laughter of Jizabel's ghost as he plays with his pet sheep. Sensing a presence nearby, she dies, and taking the form of her ten-year-old self, her soul joins Cain hand-in-hand at a tea party with their friends and loved onesâ€”although they exist as spirits, a boy nearby can hear them.|$|E
5|$|Lyndsay {{produced}} an interlude at Linlithgow Palace {{for the king}} and queen thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, which satirised the corruption of church and state, and which is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation. Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre with plays such as Jepheths and Baptistes, which influenced Pierre Corneille and Jean Racine and through them the neo-classical tradition in French drama, but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium. The anonymous The Maner of the Cyring of ane Play (before 1568) and Philotus (published in London in 1603), are isolated examples of surviving plays. The latter is a vernacular Scots comedy of errors, probably designed for court performance <b>for</b> <b>Mary,</b> Queen of Scots or James VI. The same system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland, but James VI signalled his interest in drama by arranging for a company of English players to erect a playhouse and perform in 1599.|$|E
5|$|On 10July, {{the same}} day as Jane's proclamation, a letter from Mary Tudor arrived in London, saying that she was now queen and {{demanding}} the obedience of the Council. Mary was assembling her supporters in East Anglia; it was decided to take the field against her after some discussion over who should go, in which Jane made sure that her father should not. The Duke of Northumberland marched to Cambridge with his troops and passed a week that saw no action, until he heard on 20July that the Council in London had declared <b>for</b> <b>Mary.</b> Northumberland now proclaimed Mary Tudor himself at the market-place and was arrested the next morning. On 19July, a few hours before Queen Mary I's proclamation in London, the baptism of one of the Gentlemen Pensioners' children took place. Jane had agreed to be the godmother and wished the child's name to be Guildford. The Bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner, who had been imprisoned in the Tower for five years, took great offence at this fact as he heard of it.|$|E
