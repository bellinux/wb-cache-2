50|$|During the 1970s, {{structural}} {{deficiencies in}} Burger King's franchise system became increasingly problematic for Pillsbury. A major example was {{the relationship between}} Burger King and Louisiana-based franchisee Chart House, Burger King's largest <b>franchisee</b> <b>group</b> at the time with over 350 locations in the United States. The company's owners, William and James Trotter, made several moves to take over or acquire Burger King during the 1970s, {{all of which were}} spurned by Pillsbury. After the failed attempts to acquire the company, the relationship between Chart House and Burger King soured and eventually devolved into a lawsuit. Chart House eventually spun off its Burger King operations in the early 1980s into a holding company called DiversiFoods which, in turn, was acquired by Pillsbury in 1984 and absorbed into Burger King's operations.|$|R

Taking these stores, he and his partners created a new company called Core Value Partners to renovate and update the locations which had deteriorated during Ameriking's decline. During this time, the company was renamed Heartland Food Corp. and it purchased 120 additional stores from other financially distressed owners and completely revamped them as well. The resulting purchases made Mr. Cabrerra Burger King's largest minority franchisee and Heartland one of BKC's top <b>franchisee</b> <b>groups</b> at the time.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to make the first attempt to examine {{franchisee}} personality within the context of alternative franchisee ownership structures (single unit versus multiple unit ownership) and service type (standardised versus customised). Design/methodology/approach - A self-report mail survey was used in the paper to collect data from a random sample of 363 franchisees drawn from 83 franchise groups. Personality was represented by the Big-Five personality traits (IPIP-B 5 scales), two dimensions of Empathy (IRI scales of empathic perspective taking and empathic concern) and Emotional Intelligence (EIS). Two separate between-subjects MANOVAs were conducted for each of the independent variables. Findings - Significant differences were found between <b>franchisee</b> ownership <b>groups</b> on four personality measures (conscientiousness, emotional stability, empathic perspective taking and emotional intelligence) and service type groups on two measures (extraversion and empathic perspective taking). Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed. Research limitation/implications - Future research should investigate the personality of franchisors and different types of franchisees within the context of organisational outcomes such as franchisee performance, commitment, organisational learning and intention to remain and grow within the network (within different international settings). Originality/value - This paper supplements the channels literature by using standard personality measures to differentiate franchisees that are likely to engage in different behaviours within franchise systems.

40|$|Franchising is the {{practice}} where a company (franchisor) gives a licence {{to use its}} trade name (brand) and its business model (know-how) to a particular person or <b>group</b> (<b>franchisee)</b> who agrees to act {{in accordance with the}} terms and conditions of a franchise agreement. Many different types of franchise can be found in research and practice. There are two theories explaining the reasons for using franchising: agency theory and resource scarcity theory. Franchising has a major impact on the world economy. In Croatia, franchising is in the early stage of development and {{there is a need to}} encourage businesses to expand this business model as a way of developing and expanding business (franchisor) or starting a new business (franchisee).

This case introduces a complex operational environment (key issues of the market; company structure; growth factors; challenges; use of EFQM; results) to allow exploration of the fundamental principles of strategic Operations Management and operational improvement. As such it is intended to allow students to develop their understanding and practice of key operational techniques to enable delivery of business strategy. The major topics covered are: Strategic operational influences (internal and external factors); How influences affect operational design volume, variety, variation and visability (customer contact) - (4 Vs); Operations strategy responses; Operational performance objectives (quality, cost, speed, dependability, flexibility = the 5 KPIs); Improving the Operations (EFQM) ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2004. The aim of {{this thesis}} will be to compile the ideal Occupational Personality Profile of the fuel station <b>franchisee.</b> The Sasol <b>Group</b> of {{companies}} {{made a decision to}} expand their business and go into the retail business. A decision has been made to open Sasol brand fuel stations. This new business will be operating on the basis of franchising. To be able to make this new business a success, it is of utmost important to appoint suitable fuel station franchisees. It is important to know what characteristics a fuel station franchisee needs to have to be successful and how do you measure these characteristics. The research was done using the Exel franchisees and their employees to determine if there is a generic profile for these franchisees. This generic profile is then compared with an ideal profile, which was compiled by the organisation, to determine if these profiles are compatible. A supporting tool is used {{in the form of a}} self-developed 180 degree behaviour assessment, a questionnaire which is completed by the Exel fuel station employees. The {{aim of this}} questionnaire is to determine if there is a relationship between the Exel franchisees' profile and hasher behaviour as experienced by the employees. The result indicates that a generic profile could be compiled from the individual profiles of the Exel fuel station franchisees. This means that the fuel station franchisee do have generic characteristics. This generic profile is also compatible with the ideal profile as compiled by the organisation. This result means that the organisation can use the ideal profile in the selection process, and the discrepancies between the ideal profile and the generic profile can be used to compile development programmes for the franchisees. The result also indicates that there is a relationship between the Exel franchisee and His/her behaviour as experienced by the employees. This means that the franchisees act according to his profile. The organisation can use this research to appoint potential franchisees, with a higher possible chance of being successful. The results of the research can be used as part of the fuel station franchisee selection process. Master...|$|R
40|$|We set out {{to explain}} both puzzles based on the {{importance}} of the brand name in franchising (Kaufmann and Lafontaine, 1994). The effort to develop and maintain the brand name changes over time and is difficult to verify (Hadfield, 1990), which has two implications. One is that agents who run franchise units need to be given appropriate incentives for the brand-name-maintenance effort. The other is that franchising contracts are incomplete. For incentive purposes, it is optimal to divide the agents into two groups. Those in the first group (managers of company owned units) receive a salary and focus on brand maintenance. Those in the second <b>group</b> (<b>franchisees)</b> receive a share of the revenue in their own unit and focus mainly on unit specific sales effort (Bai and Tao, 2000). However, the franchisees should also be subject to a minimum service standard that is crucial for brand name maintenance. The high-powered incentive for the franchisees to increase sales revenue implies that they have a strong tendency to divert effort from meeting the minimum standard. To discourage the franchisees from doing so, they should be subject to severe penalty when found violating the standard. We show that, to serve this purpose, it is optimal to have the franchisees make investment highly specific to their franchise companies. Specifically, the investment by the franchisee to buy physical assets (buildings, equipment, etc.) {{can be viewed as a}} performance bond for the minimum standard. If the franchisor controls the assets when the franchisee leaves the company, then the franchisor has an incentive to opportunistically accuse the franchisee of violating the standard and fire the franchisee, getting all the profits arising from the assets. If the franchisee controls the assets, such opportunistic behavior of the franchisor will not occur. Furthermore, if the assets are relationship specific so that their value is very low when detached from the brand name, then the franchisee will have strong incentive not to violate the minimum standard, fearing of being deprived the right to use the brand name in the event of violation. Overall, the plural forms of contractual and control right arrangements in franchising serve as a nexus of incentive devices for production involving brand-name-maintenance effort in an incomplete contract framework. postprintThe 2000 Taipei International Conference on Industrial Economics, Taipei, Taiwan, 15 - 17 June 2000...|$|R
40|$|Franchising {{involves}} {{a variety of}} contractual and ownership arrangements within a single company. In recent years, {{a great deal of}} effort has been made to understand this increasingly popular organization (Lafontaine, 1992, 1993, and Lafontaine and Slade, 1997). There are at least two stylized facts that have posed challenges to the existing theories of the firm. One is the co-existence of company-owned and franchised units, and the other is that franchisees make substantial amount of investment highly specific to their franchise companies. We set out to explain both puzzles based on the importance of the brand name in franchising (Kaufmann and Lafontaine, 1994).
