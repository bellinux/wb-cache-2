40|$|We {{present a}} formal {{approach}} for modeling complex commands characterized by heavy overloading of function, {{large numbers of}} parameters, dependencies among parameters, subtle side effects, and lack of abstraction. Complex commands arise {{in a variety of}} business settings such as requesting a brokerage order, enrolling in a course, and specifying a product order. In addition, complex commands are also prevalent where specification of commands is strictly separated from multiple, independent implementations as in open software standards. Our approach is based on an inheritance structure known as a command lattice. Like other forms of inheritance, command lattices support incremental <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>abbreviation</b> of specifications. Because a complete command lattice can have a large number of specifications, we develop another structure known as a minimal command tree in which a command lattice is derived from a much smaller number of independent specifications. To map from a minimal command tree to a command lattice, we present algorithms that materialize an arbitrary node of a command lattice and compactly generate the behavior of a command lattice. To demonstrate the potential of command lattices, we have implemented a set of tools that provide convenient specification and powerful reasoning capabilities. Our tool collection includes the Comman...|$|R
40|$|In October 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in {{collaboration}} with federal, state, local, and non-governmental partners, launched the National Plan to Eliminate Syphilis. In the plan, CDC identified key strategies needed for successful elimination of syphilis from the United States: expanded surveillance and outbreak response activities, rapid screening and treatment {{in and out of}} medical settings, expanded laboratory services, strengthened community involvement and agency partnerships, and enhanced health promotion. In the six years since its establishment, numerous gains have been made in reducing disease incidence in key groups, raising professional and public awareness of syphilis, increasing financial investment into public Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) clinic services, and building local public health and community capacity to fight this devastating disease. However, new challenges have emerged. After reaching a nadir in 2001, diagnoses of primary and secondary syphilis are again on the increase. Today, more than 60 % of new infections are diagnosed in {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM). The evolving epidemiology, changing risk groups, and social environments present challenges for elimination and STD program activities. Syphilis is now increasingly diagnosed in the private sector, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the identification and management in this setting. Public health services face increasing pressures from rising demand and decreasing financial resources. The social contexts of poverty, racism, homophobia, and socio-economic discrimination continue to drive the concentration of the disease in those with high-risk sexual behaviors, poor access to care, or both. In reframing the future of the Syphilis Elimination Effort, CDC's vision is to create a dynamic, evidence- based and culturally competent prevention and control action plan for the elimination of syphilis from the United States. By 2010, interim elimination targets will be to reduce rates of primary and secondary syphilis in the United States to less than 2. 2 per 100, 000 population; congenital syphilis to fewer than 3. 9 per 100, 000 live births; and Black: White racial disparities to a ratio of less than 3 : 1. In order to achieve this, CDC will focus syphilis elimination activities in achieving three strategic goals: Investment in and enhancement of public health services; prioritization of evidence-based, culturally competent interventions; and creating accountable services and interventions. For each of the three goals, CDC recommends that syphilis elimination activities be delivered in three strategic areas of focus (The 3 -By- 3 approach to syphilis elimination). This results in nine strategies: Surveillance, Clinical and Laboratory Services, Community Mobilization, Health care Provider Mobilization; Tailoring of Interventions; Evidence-based Action Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation; Training and Staff Development; and Research. This plan provides a framework for continuing to deliver interventions aimed at eliminating syphilis as a public health problem in the United States. It should not be seen as a rigid blueprint for eliminating syphilis instantly. Rather, the plan provides guidance that helps local, state, and national partners to effectively focus on the problem in order to get the most important things done in the most cost-effective, ethical, and acceptable ways possible. Further details on the strategies and recommended activities are contained in an accompanying Syphilis Elimination Technical Appendix (SETA).

40|$|Een {{master-slave}} systeem voor heelkundige ingrepen, voorzien van be trouwbare krachtterugkoppeling, maakt het mogelijk ook voor complexere i ngrepen minimaal invasieve technieken te gebruiken. Voor het lokaliseren van tumoren, verborgen aders en venen, of de kwaliteitscontrole van een steek, baseren de chirurgen zich voornamelijk op de stijfheid van het w eefsel. Dit werk integreert de karakteristieken van de menselijke perceptie van stijfheid in het ontwerpproces van de teleoperatiecontrole. Bij gebruik van traditionele controleschemas limiteert de wrijving in de medische r obot de kwaliteit van de krachtterugkoppeling. Een combinatie van het online schatten van de omgevingsstijfheid met een directe weergave van deze stijfheid in de haptische interface is ontwik keld. Deze techniek ontkoppelt de controle voor het uitvoeren van de taa k van de terugkoppeling van de informatie. De regelaars van de medische robot en de haptische interface kunnen onafhankelijk van elkaar worden o ntwikkeld, wat resulteert in verhoogde stabiliteit en positienauwkeurigh eid. De wrijving in de medische robot heeft bij gebruik van deze technie k geen invloed meer op de teruggekoppelde stijfheid. Dit werk introduceert verder het concept van verhoogde gevoeligheid voor het discrimineren van stijfheidsverschillen. Met het telechirurgisch sy steem kan de chirurg zo kleinere stijfheidsverschillen detecteren dan me t de blote hand. Deze techniek verhoogt de nauwkeurigheid en biedt een h oger zekerheidsniveau bij palpatie. Een experiment met directe weergave van de stijfheid in de haptische interface, gecombineerd met het online vormen van het gewenste gevoel, toont de technische haalbaarheid aan.

In the UK they were given alias numbers BS 5723 and BS 6723 respectively.

Through a literature review, a number of heuristics were defined for automatic abbreviation detection. These were used in the construction of the Swedish Clinical Abbreviation Normalizer (SCAN). The heuristics were: a) freely available external resources: a dictionary of general Swedish, a dictionary of medical terms and a dictionary of known Swedish medical abbreviations, b) maximum word lengths (from three to eight characters), and c) heuristics for handling common patterns such as hyphenation.

40|$|The STS- 75 Space Shuttle Program Mission Report {{summarizes}} the Payload activities {{as well as}} the Orbiter, External Tank (ET), Solid Rocket Booster (SRB), Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM), and the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME) systems performance during the seventy-fifth flight of the Space Shuttle Program, the fiftieth flight since the return-to-flight, and the nineteenth flight of the Orbiter Columbia (OV- 102). In addition to the Orbiter, the flight vehicle consisted of an ET that was designated ET- 76; three SSME's that were designated as serial numbers 2029, 2034, and 2017 in positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively; and two SRB's that were designated BI- 078. The RSRM's, designated RSRM- 53, were installed in each SRB and the individual RSRMs were designated as 36 OW 53 A for the left SRB, and 36 OW 053 B for the right SRB. The primary objectives of this flight were to perform the operations necessary to fulfill the requirements of the Tethered Satellite System- 1 R (TSS- 1 R), and the United States Microgravity Payload- 3 (USMP- 3). The secondary objectives were to complete the operations of the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment (OARE), and to meet the requirements of the Middeck Glovebox (MGBX) facility and the Commercial Protein Crystal Growth (CPCG) experiment. Appendix A provides the <b>definition</b> of acronyms <b>and</b> <b>abbreviations</b> used thorughout the report.
