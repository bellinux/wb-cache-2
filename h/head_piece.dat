25|$|Initial hip {{designs were}} made of a {{one-piece}} femoral component and a one-piece acetabular component. Current designs have a femoral stem and separate <b>head</b> <b>piece.</b> Using an independent head allows the surgeon to adjust leg length (some heads seat more or less onto the stem) and to select from various materials from which the head is formed. A modern acetabulum component is also made up of two parts: a metal shell with a coating for bone attachment and a separate liner. First the shell is placed. Its position can be adjusted, unlike the original cemented cup design which are fixed in place once the cement sets. When proper positioning of the metal shell is obtained, the surgeon may select a liner made from various materials.|$|E

The standalone CD has {{a close-up of}} Koda looking down to the camera, holding a cigarette holder. The CD and DVD format has a long shot of Koda sitting at on a chair with different flowers sitting on the <b>head</b> <b>piece.</b> The three limited edition box set cover sleeves are similar images with different poses; the first box set has Koda {{standing in front of}} a wall with Japanese design; Koda is holding a traditional Oil-paper umbrella and is dressed in a pink kimono. The second box set artwork has Koda facing towards the camera, similar to the previous box set. The only change in the third box set artwork is that Koda is seen without holding the umbrella. The digital release uses the first limited edition box set artwork. The booklet and photo shoot were designed by Japanese designer Jun Hirota, and the design was based on traditional Japanese culture and the emphasizing of geisha art. The photo album that came with the second limited edition box set features a 28-page spread, featuring different images from the Japonesque photo shoot.|$|E
25|$|Bradypodion pumilum have a {{much higher}} {{survival}} rate in a metropolitan area if they are bigger in size. Their survival rate was dependent on body size, and the larger the size, the greater the chance that the individual would survive a ten-day period. Larger, older chameleons {{tend to be more}} sedentary compared to the smaller younger ones which means that the larger ones likely have smaller home ranges. Smaller chameleons inhabit grasses while larger chameleons are found mainly in bushes and trees. This is territorial, because it is believed that larger males would cannibalize smaller ones intruding on their territory. An alternative thought is that the smaller chameleons simply do not have big enough limbs to grasp larger branches correctly. When fighting contests occur, the outcome is influenced by the height of the ornamental casque, the relative size of the pink patch {{in the center of the}} flank, and previous experience. The ornamental casque is the protruding <b>head</b> <b>piece</b> of the chameleon, usually with a rounded end. The height of this piece is an honest signal to other male chameleons representing its total size. Similarly with the pink patch in the center of the flank, this is an honest signal showing that the chameleon has a healthy diet correlating to the strength of the individual. The turnover rate in males is thought to be higher than females.|$|E

The song was shortened and had Gaga performing it in a clear bath tub while wearing a Statue of Liberty styled <b>head</b> <b>piece.</b> Gaga ventured into the crowd during the song, through the extended pathways from the stage and after the performance she invited a fan onstage. Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle believed that the appearance of [...] "LoveGame" [...] during the tour proved {{it to be a}} far superior track than the ones from Gaga's second studio album, Born This Way (2011).

500|$|Horizon Zero Dawn is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game played from a third-person perspective. Players {{take control of}} Aloy, a hunter and archer, as she ventures through a post-apocalyptic land ruled by robotic creatures known simply as [...] "machines". Aloy can kill enemies {{in a variety of}} ways, such as setting traps like tripwires using the Tripcaster, shooting them with arrows, using explosives, and a spear. Machine components, including electricity and the metal they are composed of, are vital to Aloy's survival, and she can loot their corpses to find useful resources for crafting. Ammo; resource satchels, pouches, and quivers; resistance, antidote, and health potions; and traps are all amenable to crafting. Weapons have modification slots for dealing more damage. A small <b>head</b> <b>piece</b> that Aloy wears called a Focus allows her to scan machines to determine their susceptibilities, identify their location, the particular level they possess, and the nature of loot they will drop. One machine, the Stalker, can enable cloaking technology as a means of averting the gaze of Aloy's Focus scan.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Dupuis {{was given}} the task of {{redesigning}} Jason for the tenth Friday the 13th film. One concept brought into the film was Jason's regenerative abilities. Dupuis gave the character more hair {{and more of a}} natural flesh appearance to illustrate the constant regeneration the character goes through; Dupuis wanted a more [...] "gothic" [...] design for Jason, so he added chains and shackles, and made the hockey mask more angular. Jim Isaac {{and the rest of his}} crew wanted to create an entirely new Jason at some point in the film. The idea was for the teens to completely destroy Jason's body, allowing the futuristic technology to bring him back to life. What was referred to as Über-Jason was designed to have chunks of metal growing from his body, bonded by tendrils that grew into the metal, all pushing through a leather suit. The metal was created from VacuForm, the same material used to increase the size of the original hockey mask, and was attached by Velcro. The tendrils were made from silicone. All of the pieces were crafted onto one suit, including an entire <b>head</b> <b>piece,</b> which Hodder wore. The make-up effects team added zippers along the side of the suit, which allowed Hodder to enter and exit the suit within 15 minutes.|$|E

It features guest appearances from rappers Young Chris, Tre, Pusha T, Anwan Glover and Bun B.. The video shows Wale and Gaga at the District of Columbia's Cardozo Senior High School and Wale in various venues and streets in the District, including South Boston Waterfront. This includes one scene in the famous hidden clothing store Bodega in Boston where Wale tries on various clothes. One of Gaga's characteristic Great Danes, which had also previously appeared in the music videos for [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Poker Face", appears in the video for [...] "Chillin", wearing Beats by Dr. Dre headphones. Several posters of Barack Obama appear in the video. The music video was added to BET's TV rotation.

She's wearing a short dress with pumps, but she's surprisingly without her facial lightning bolt, crystal staff or orbiting <b>head</b> <b>piece</b> (as seen on her Ellen appearance).

500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} {{live for the}} first time at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. Gaga began the performance wearing a square-shaped <b>head</b> <b>piece</b> and an all-white cape as pre-recorded boos were quickly replaced by sound of cheers. Gaga then glided across the stage and was assisted by her dancers as she changed into a black sequin leotard and performed the intricate choreography seen in the song's corresponding music video. Throughout the performance she cycled through costumes and wigs she had previously employed throughout her career. She was also dancing with a Jeff Koons blue gazing ball, and had her face painted in the style of the single cover by one of her dancers. She concluded the performance by emerging from behind jungle-like scenery dressed in a seashell bikini ensemble, wearing a bigb londe curly wig and taking a bow. Gaga collaborated with experimental theater director Robert Wilson on the performance. His designed set featured a shimmering white jungle background with letters spelling [...] "Applause" [...] suspended from tree branches. Gaga characterized the performance as: [...] "So beautiful, it is so indicative of me as an artist. I feel in many ways that the performance is like a giant metaphor for me." [...] She also commented that the production was [...] "the most physically challenging performance I've done, ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Westmore was {{responsible}} for taking Probert's designs for the Ferengi and creating the make-up for the actors to meet that design. In Probert's original concept, the Ferengi had ears which were pointed like a bat. There were concerns from the producers that these would appear simply to be larger versions of the already known Vulcan ears, and so Westmore was told to round off the ears {{when it came to}} producing the make-up. Other elements which were changed at the make-up stage included modifications to the nose to increase the volume of wrinkles and dropping the idea of an extended chin as Westmore thought it would save time in applying the make-up. A set of false upper teeth were also created, which were added to a single <b>head</b> <b>piece</b> and a nose piece which comprised the prosthetics for the Ferengi. Westmore was not pleased when a shot of an actor in costume was leaked without the teeth, he said [...] "I was annoyed about that photo because the make-up was incomplete. After all the work that went into it, we would have wanted our design in proper form. The photo was like a pirated version of our make-up, because none of us would ever approved it under those circumstances." [...] Michael Okuda designed a rank designation tattoo which Westmore applied to the right part of each Ferengi forehead. The symbol means [...] "Dog eat dog" [...] and was painted green as that is the colour of American dollar bills. Each bar (referred to by the production crew as a [...] "rocker") {{to the side of the}} symbol designated a rank, with more bars meaning a higher rank.|$|E

Ball and pins travel on a continuously running carpet belt {{at the bottom of}} the pit. The ball, being heavier, travels to one of the side kick-backs where it enters the ball return, shared by adjacent lanes. The pins travel under the cushion into the ring-shaped, revolving circular pin elevator, at the rear center of the unit, which brings the pins up to a [...] "distributor arm" [...] that travels laterally as well as forward and back (on the 82-30, [...] governs the distributor's <b>head</b> <b>piece</b> movements) over the table , to deliver the pins to the corresponding bins or [...] "spotting cups" [...] as known in the 82-30's factory manuals, awaiting the next spotting cycle.

After the table returns to its upper position, the sweep also lifts, and the machine shuts down to await the next ball. For spotting the new rack of pins, the 82-30 version tilts the pin-filled spotting cups vertically as the table descends, and tilts the cups slightly rearwards [...] to clear the new rack of pins just as the table starts upwards, leaving the new rack of pins spotted on the lane for the next frame.|$|E
