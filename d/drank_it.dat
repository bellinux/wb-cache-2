5|$|Malvern Water {{has been}} drunk by several British monarchs. Queen Elizabeth I <b>drank</b> <b>it</b> in {{public in the}} 16th century; in 1558 she accorded John Hornyold, a Catholic bishop and lord of the manor, {{the right to use}} the land under the {{condition}} that travellers and pilgrims continue to be able to draw water from the Holy Well spring. A royal warrant was granted by Princess Mary Adelaide in 1895 and by King George V in 1911. Queen Victoria refused to travel without it and Queen Elizabeth II took it with her whenever she was travelling.|$|E
5|$|Pottier {{also won}} the fourth stage. In the fifth stage, he was leading by one hour at the halfway point. A cycling legend says {{that he decided to}} stop, entered a bar and ordered a bottle of wine, and <b>drank</b> <b>it</b> almost completely. When he saw the first other cyclists passing by, Pottier mounted his bicycle again, went after them, and won the stage. By this point, Pottier was leading the overall {{classification}} firmly. The winner of the 1905 Tour de France, Louis Trousselier, had had a bad first half of the Tour, and was many points behind. Trousselier rediscovered his form {{in the second half of}} the race, won the 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th stages, and was challenging the second place of Georges Passerieu. Passerieu defended his position by winning the 12th stage. In the last stage, Pottier showed his strength by winning the stage, after finishing together in Paris with Passerieu.|$|E
5|$|The few {{men who had}} {{not been}} wounded because they were manning the ships during the battle were {{reinforced}} with three men who had suffered relatively minor wounds; they put ashore at a remote beach to dig for water. They found some and brought it back to the ships, although it sickened those who <b>drank</b> <b>it.</b> The two ships sailed through a storm for two days and nights; Alaminos, the pilot, then steered a course for Florida, where they found good drinking water, although they lost one man to the local Indians and another drank so much water that he died. The ships finally made port in Cuba, where Hernández de Cordóba wrote a report to Governor Velázquez describing the voyage, the cities, the plantations, and, most importantly, the discovery of gold. Hernández died soon after from his wounds. The two captured Maya survived the voyage to Cuba and were interrogated; they swore that there was abundant gold in Yucatán.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Malvern Hill on 1 July 1862, Brandon's {{ankle joint}} {{was struck by}} a ball. As he fell, his hand hit a rolling shell which did not explode. Oblivious to his wounds, Brandon tried to rise again but he fell once more and {{remained}} on the field until men were able to pick him up and carry him to the rear. Because there was no visible bleeding, Brandon thought that his injuries were not serious but was taken on horse-back to a hospital. Initially, Brandon was offered whiskey which would have eased the pain, but he refused to drink it without water and sugar. He <b>drank</b> <b>it</b> only after being convinced it was necessary. Brandon's foot was removed after a torniquet was put in place. Brandon's arteries were then sewn in what was likely to be a very painful procedure, as there was not enough choloroform to produce a full anesthesia. To replace his amputated leg, his doctors gave him a wooden prosthetic leg. Because of Brandon's age, his doctors thought his chances of survival were slight. After coming to Richmond, he was tended to by friends and his servant. Confederate President Jefferson Davis even offered Brandon the hospitality of his mansion in the city.|$|E

In {{the thirteenth century}} Blood Bowl Sutra, for instance, Mulian's mother must swim in a bloody pool and drink blood to punish her for letting her menstrual blood flow into public waters which the Buddha <b>drank</b> <b>it</b> when his followers used it {{to make him a}} cup of tea.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{after the}} initial aversion to cocoa had disappeared, {{supplies}} were sent to Spain. The second major transformation of chocolate {{at the hands of}} the Spanish was in the serving method: the cocoa was heated until it became a liquid. This was in contrast to the natives of the New World, who generally <b>drank</b> <b>it</b> cold or at room temperature. The third change was the addition of spices from the Old World like cinnamon, ground black pepper or aniseed.|$|E

25|$|By the 15th century, the Aztecs {{gained control}} of {{a large part of}} Mesoamerica and adopted cacao into their culture. They {{associated}} chocolate with Quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans, and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice. In contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs <b>drank</b> <b>it</b> cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the Cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree, chile pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.|$|E
25|$|Another myth {{associated}} with Boötes by Hyginus {{is that of}} Icarius, who was schooled as a grape farmer and winemaker by Dionysus. Icarius made wine so strong that those who <b>drank</b> <b>it</b> appeared poisoned, which caused shepherds to avenge their supposedly poisoned friends by killing Icarius. Maera, Icarius' dog, brought his daughter Erigone to her father's body, whereupon both she and the dog committed suicide. Zeus then chose to honor all three by placing them in the sky as constellations: Icarius as Boötes, Erigone as Virgo, and Maera as Canis Major or Canis Minor.|$|E

Lu Kang once sent wine to Yang Hu, who <b>drank</b> <b>it</b> without showing any signs of suspicion. Later, when Lu Kang fell sick, Yang Hu sent medicine to him, which Lu also took without suspecting anything.

25|$|Bottled beers were commonplace by the 17th {{century for}} the well off {{who wished to}} drink outside of public inns, or who {{wanted to take a}} beer with them when fishing. There is a famous story of Alexander Nowell, the Dean of St Paul's, who, in 1568, left his bottled beer by the river bank, and upon {{returning}} a few days later discovered the bottle opened with a bang and that the contents were very tasty. But while the middle and upper classes could indulge themselves with such expensive luxuries, the ordinary folk continued to drink their beer served direct from the cask. India Pale Ale (IPA), the famous ale that was shipped to India, was delivered in casks, and only transferred to the bottle for the civilian middle classes; the troops drank their beer the same way they <b>drank</b> <b>it</b> back home, from flagons filled direct from the cask. But as beer developed and became paler and lower in alcohol, so it became more difficult to keep it fresh tasting in the cask, especially in countries with warmer climates. By the late 19th century commercial refrigeration and Louis Pasteur's flash heating method of sterilisation prolonged the life of beer. In Britain's cooler climate these methods did not catch on at this time.|$|E
