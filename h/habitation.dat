5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human activity on the site pre-dating the Iron Age, {{as far back as}} 8,0006,000BC. During this period Mellor may have been a knap site where flint tools were produced, and also may have been a seasonal camp. Over 200lithics have been recovered and range from the early to the late Mesolithic. A high proportion of the flints are bladed tools, indicating that the people who produced them were hunter gatherers. Bronze Age artefacts are rare on the site, and there is no definitive indication of <b>habitation</b> in this period. Despite this, {{it is likely that the}} long-term <b>habitation</b> of the site had its roots in the late Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|According to archaeological {{and genetic}} evidence, North and South America {{were the last}} continents {{in the world with}} human <b>habitation.</b> During the Wisconsin glaciation, 50,000–17,000 years ago, falling sea levels allowed people to move across the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to north west North America (Alaska). Alaska was {{ice-free}} because of low snowfall, allowing a small population to exist. The Laurentide ice sheet covered most of Canada, blocking nomadic inhabitants and confining them to Alaska (East Beringia) for thousands of years.|$|E

5|$|After the First World War, the Urban District Council, {{which had}} {{replaced}} the District Board in 1894, began a programme of urban improvement. Large areas of open farmland were purchased for the building of council houses, and a notorious slum area, Ogley Square, which had been declared unfit for human <b>habitation,</b> was demolished after a long legal dispute and the tenants rehoused. The final farmland {{within the boundaries of}} Brownhills was sold for redevelopment in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Although Triatominae bugs feed on them, birds {{appear to}} be immune to {{infection}} and therefore are {{not considered to be}} a T. cruzi reservoir. Even when colonies of insects are eradicated from a house and surrounding domestic animal shelters, they can re-emerge from plants or animals {{that are part of the}} ancient, sylvatic (referring to wild animals) infection cycle. This is especially likely in zones with mixed open savannah, with clumps of trees interspersed by human <b>habitation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the willie wagtail is an {{aggressive}} defender of its nest, predators do account for many eggs and young. About {{two thirds of}} eggs hatch successfully, and a third leave the nest as fledglings.

The proximity of nesting to human <b>habitation</b> has also left nests open to destruction by children.|$|E
