25|$|Microelectronic {{components}} {{are created by}} chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies, compound semiconductors like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of <b>electronic</b> <b>charge</b> and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves {{a significant amount of}} chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field to have a very good working knowledge of the effects of quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|For example, when atomic sodium {{reacts with}} atomic chlorine, sodium donates one {{electron}} and attains an oxidation state of +1. Chlorine accepts the electron and its oxidation state {{is reduced to}} −1. The sign of the oxidation state (positive/negative) actually corresponds {{to the value of}} each ion's <b>electronic</b> <b>charge.</b> The attraction of the differently charged sodium and chlorine ions is the reason they then form an ionic bond.|$|E

40|$|Voltage-dependent gating {{behavior}} of Shaker potassium channels without N-type inactivation (ShB delta 6 - 46) expressed in Xenopus oocytes was studied. The voltage {{dependence of the}} steady-state open probability indicated that the activation process involves {{the movement of the}} equivalent of 12 - 16 <b>electronic</b> <b>charges</b> across the membrane. The sigmoidal kinetics of the activation process, which is maintained at depolarized voltages up to at least + 100 mV indicate the presence of at least five sequential conformational changes before opening. The voltage dependence of the gating charge movement suggested that each elementary transition involves 3. 5 <b>electronic</b> <b>charges.</b> The voltage dependence of the forward opening rate, as estimated by the single- channel first latency distribution, the final phase of the macroscopic ionic current activation, the ionic current reactivation and the ON gating current time course, showed movement of the equivalent of 0. 3 to 0. 5 <b>electronic</b> <b>charges</b> were associated with a large number of the activation transitions. The equivalent charge movement of 1. 1 <b>electronic</b> <b>charges</b> was associated with the closing conformational change. The results were generally consistent with models involving a number of independent and identical transitions with a major exception that the first closing transition is slower than expected as indicated by tail current and OFF gating charge measurements...|$|R

Nuclei in states with non-spherical charge distributions, i.e. all those with angular quantum number (I) greater than 1/2, have a nuclear quadrupole moment.

40|$|The <b>electronic</b> <b>charging</b> of mine dust {{can cause}} {{coal-dust}} explosion {{and increase the}} risk of pneumoconiosis, so it is necessary to take more attention to the study of its <b>electronic</b> <b>charging</b> properties. The mechanism of <b>electronic</b> <b>charging</b> of coal mine dust was investigated in this paper. It was found that the formation and polarity of dust are determined by the energy band structure and of the two contacting sides; then a mathematical model of work function is established in mesoscopic level. The experiments conclude that the work function decreases with the particle size for the dust with same properties, moreover large particles are positively charged and small particles are negatively charged. Finally, the experimental verification of the main particles charged model drive unipolar and bipolar charged modes and confirm the correctness of microstructure and mesoscopic analyses, which furthermore lay the foundation for further research. </p...|$|R

5000|$|OECTs are {{different}} from electrolyte-gated field-effect transistors. In the latter type of device, ions do not penetrate into the channel, but rather accumulate near its surface (or near {{the surface of a}} dielectric layer, when such a layer is deposited on the channel). [...] This induces accumulation of <b>electronic</b> <b>charge</b> inside the channel, near the surface. In contrast, in OECTs, ions are injected into the channel and change the <b>electronic</b> <b>charge</b> density throughout its entire volume. As a result of this bulk coupling between ionic and <b>electronic</b> <b>charge,</b> OECTs show a very high transconductance. The disadvantage of OECTs is that they are slow, as ionic charge has {{to get in and out}} of the channel. Microfabricated OECTs show response times of the order of hundreds of microseconds.|$|E

40|$|Planar large-bipolarons {{can form}} {{if the ratio}} of the {{surrounding}} mediums static to high-frequency dielectric constants is especially large. A large-bipolaron in p-doped La 2 CuO 4 is modeled as two electrons being removed from the out-of-plane orbitals of four oxygen ions circumscribed by four copper ions of a CuO 2 layer. These oxygen dianions relax inwardly as they donate electrons to the surrounding outwardly relaxing copper cations. This charge transfer generates the strong in-plane electron-lattice interaction needed to stabilize a large-bipolaron with respect to decomposing into polarons. The lowest-energy radial in-plane optic vibration of a large-bipolarons four core oxygen ions with their associated <b>electronic</b> <b>charges</b> has d-symmetry. <b>Electronic</b> relaxation in response to multiple large-bipolarons atomic vibrations lowers their frequencies to generate a phonon-mediated attraction among them which fosters their condensation into a liquid.

50|$|A cathode is the {{electrode}} {{from which a}} conventional current leaves a polarized electrical device. (This definition can be recalled by using the mnemonic CCD for cathode current departs.) A conventional current describes {{the direction in which}} positive <b>electronic</b> <b>charges</b> move. Electrons have a negative charge, so the movement of electrons is opposite to the conventional current flow. Consequently, the mnemonic cathode current departs also means that electrons flow into the device's cathode.|$|R

40|$|Steady-state and kinetic {{properties}} of gating currents of the Shaker K+ channels were studied in channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes and recorded with the cut-open oocyte voltage clamp. The charge versus potential (Q-V) curve reveals {{at least two}} components of charge, the first moving in the hyperpolarized region (V 1 / 2 = - 63 mV) and the second, with a larger apparent valence, moving in the more depolarized region (V 1 / 2 = - 44 mV). The kinetic analysis of gating currents revealed also two exponential decaying components that corresponded in their voltage dependence with the charge components described in the steady-state. The first component was found to correlate {{with the effects of}} prepulses that produce the Cole-Moore shift of the ionic and gating currents and seems to be occurring completely within closed conformations of the channel. The second component seems {{to be related to the}} events occurring between the closed states just preceding, but not including, the transition to the open state. The ON and OFF gating currents exhibit a pronounced rising phase at potentials at which the second component becomes important, and this region corresponds to the potential range where the channel opens. The results could not be explained with simple parallel models, but the data can be fitted to a sequential model that could be related to a first rearrangement of the putative four subunits in cooperative fashion, followed by a concerted charge movement that leads to the open channel. The first series of charge movements are produced by transitions between several closed states carrying less than two <b>electronic</b> <b>charges</b> per step, while a step carrying about 3. 5 <b>electronic</b> <b>charges</b> can explain the second component. This step is followed by the transition to the open state carrying less than 0. 5 <b>electronic</b> <b>charges.</b> This model is able to reproduce all the kinetic and steady-state {{properties of}} the gating currents and predicts many of the properties of the ionic currents...|$|R
