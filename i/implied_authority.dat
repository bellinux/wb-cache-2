25|$|As the United States {{continued}} to grow, many Americans advocated {{a system of}} internal improvements to help the country develop. Monroe agreed the young nation needed an improved infrastructure, including a transportation network in order to grow and thrive economically. However, he discerned no Constitutional authority to build, maintain, and operate a national transportation system. He therefore urged Congress to introduce a constitutional amendment granting it such power. Congress never acted on his suggestion because many legislators thought they already had the <b>implied</b> <b>authority</b> to enact such measures.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other {{intentional}} torts, {{which tend}} to be premeditated, liability for assault has been found in several cases prior to Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd. Poland v Parr & Sons involved an employee who assaulted a boy, believing him to be attempting to steal his employer's goods. Vicarious liability was imposed based on the employee's <b>implied</b> <b>authority</b> to protect his master's goods. Liability was also found where a tram conductor - in his duties - pushed a passenger out a tram, after he had not paid his fare. However, assault involving personal vengeance and spite was generally not found to result in liability, as in Warren v Henlys Ltd. This represents a principal limitation of the previous position of liability: only where an act was in the course of employment could an employer be liable. Premeditation and personal motive would take an employee out of their course of employment, breaking liability. The establishment of the close connection test has produced different results in cases of intentional assault, as demonstrated in Mattis v Pollock. Here, a bouncer for a nightclub was involved in a dispute with a customer. He subsequently went home and returned with a knife, stabbing the customer, resulting in serious injuries. The employer was held liable, despite the bouncer's intent on revenge, due to the close connection of the tort to the bouncer's employment and duties. It was of particular importance that the bouncer was employed to act in an aggressive and tough manner.|$|E
50|$|Anarchist {{communism}} as an anarchist {{philosophy is}} against hierarchy {{in all its}} forms. Anarchist communists {{do not think that}} anyone has the right to be anyone else's master, or 'boss' as this is a concept of capitalism and the state and <b>implies</b> <b>authority</b> over the individual. Some contemporary anarchist communists and advocates of post-left anarchy, such as Bob Black, reject the concept of work altogether in favor of turning necessary subsistence tasks into voluntary free play.|$|R

6000|$|Now it is {{perceived}} from {{the reading of}} this {{that there is nothing}} express upon the subject, but that the authority is sought to be implied merely for the general provision of [...] "all rightful subjects of legislation." [...] In reply to this I insist, as a legal rule of construction, as well as the plain, popular view of the matter, that the express provision for Utah and New Mexico coming in with slavery, if they choose, when they shall form constitutions, is an exclusion of all <b>implied</b> <b>authority</b> on the same subject; that Congress having the subject distinctly in their minds when they made the express provision, they therein expressed their whole meaning on that subject.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Implied</b> <b>Authority</b> of Contract {{is a legal}} term. In {{contract}} law, it is {{the implied}} ability of an individual to make a legally binding contract {{on behalf of a}}n organization, by way of uniform or interaction with the public on behalf of that organization. When a person is wearing a uniform or nametag bearing the logo or trademark of a business or organization; or if that person is functioning in an obviously authorized capacity on behalf of a business or organization, that person carries an <b>Implied</b> <b>Authority</b> of Contract. <b>Implied</b> <b>Authority</b> is authority that is not express or written into the contract, but which the agent is assumed to have in order to transact the business of insurance for the principal. <b>Implied</b> <b>authority</b> is incidental to express authority since not every single detail of an agent's authority can be spelled out in the written contract.|$|E

Although the term [...] "clergy" [...] is not typically used in the LDS Church, it would most appropriately apply to local bishops and stake presidents. Merely holding {{an office in the}} priesthood does not <b>imply</b> <b>authority</b> over other church members or agency to act on behalf of the entire church.|$|R
5000|$|While the Declaration {{has been}} a central {{document}} guiding research practice, its future has been called into question. Challenges include the apparent conflict between guides, such as the CIOMS and Nuffield Council documents. Another is whether it should concentrate on basic principles {{as opposed to being}} more prescriptive, and hence controversial. It has continually grown and faced more frequent revisions. The recent controversies undermine the authority of the document, as does the apparent desertion by major bodies, and any rewording must embrace deeply and widely held values, since continual shifts in the text do not <b>imply</b> <b>authority.</b> The actual claims to authority particularly on a global level, by the insertion of the word [...] "international" [...] in article 10 has been challenged.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{growing number}} of current web sites combine active content (applications) from untrusted sources, as in {{so-called}} mashups. The objectcapability model provides an appealing approach for isolating untrusted content: if separate applications are provided disjoint capabilities, a sound objectcapability framework should prevent untrusted applications from interfering with each other, without preventing interaction with the user or the hosting page. In developing language-based foundations for isolation proofs based on object-capability concepts, we identify a more general notion of authority safety that also implies resource isolation. After proving that capability safety <b>implies</b> <b>authority</b> safety, we show the applicability of our framework for a specific class of mashups. In addition to proving that a JavaScript subset based on Google Caja is capability safe, we prove that a more expressive subset of JavaScript is authority safe, {{even though it is}} not based on the object-capability model. ...|$|R

30|$|In {{political}} science, {{the bases}} of legitimacy are consensus and identity, <b>implying</b> <b>authority</b> and order. That is, legitimacy is based on being the authority and respecting order. The former stresses identity while the latter refers to behavior. To achieve good governance, management bodies and personals are expected to maximize coordination among citizens {{as well as between}} government and citizens, and their legitimacy of public management comes from the maximum consent and approval of citizens (Yu, 2000 : 117). Specifically, the concept of ‘citizen’ includes society and market. This implies that there are in total three subjects of governance, namely society, market and government. The legitimacy of these three subjects’ qualification (the origin of this type of legitimacy will not be discussed in this paper) can be constructed during participation processes. Also, order-based legitimacy can be established during participation. Therefore, essentially, the legitimacy of governance infers process-oriented explorations rather than conclusive judgments.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Implied</b> actual <b>{{authority}},</b> {{also called}} [...] "usual authority", is authority an agent has {{by virtue of}} being reasonably necessary to carry out his express authority. As such, it can be inferred by virtue of a position held by an agent. For example, partners have authority to bind the other partners in the firm, their liability being joint and several, and in a corporation, all executives and senior employees with decision-making authority by virtue of their position have authority to bind the corporation.Other forms of <b>implied</b> actual <b>authority</b> include customary authority. This is where customs of a trade imply the agent to have certain powers. Wool buying industries it is customary for traders to purchase in their own names.Also incidental authority, where an agent is supposed to have any authority to complete other task which is necessary and incidental to completing the express actual authority. This must be no more than necessary ...|$|R
