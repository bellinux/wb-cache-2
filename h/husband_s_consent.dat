40|$|This article {{examines}} section 226 -b of the New York Real Property law, {{enacted by the}} New York State Legislature in 1975. Enacted to give tenants in a dwelling having four or more residential units the right to sublease or assign their apartments, subject to the landlord 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>consent,</b> it provides that the landlord must release the tenant from the lease if (s) he 2 ̆ 2 unreasonably withholds consent for such sublease or assignment. 2 ̆ 2 The section thus gives tenants {{the right to remain}} in occupancy or to elect to be released from their leasehold obligations. However, some courts have interpreted this section to confer upon tenants a broad statutory right to sublease their apartments upon compliance with the statute 2 ̆ 7 s procedural notification requirements and the landlord 2 ̆ 7 s unreasonable withholding of consent. This Note discusses the legislative intent of section 226 -b, specifically addressing whether it gives a residential tenant the right to execute a valid sublease without the landlord 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>consent</b> if s/he complies with the statute 2 ̆ 7 s requirements. It analyzes the right to sublease under common law as compared to the statutory right to sublease under section 226 -b, and contends that the tenant has the statutory remedies of terminating or remaining in occupancy, but not of subleasing without landlord approval...|$|R

40|$|Scholarship on Islam {{and gender}} {{consistently}} {{questions as to}} whether or not Islamic norms oppress Muslim women 2 ̆ 7 s agency. One aspect of this discussion is the issue of a Muslim woman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>consent</b> in getting married and in sexual relations. The scholarship of Kecia Ali focuses on this issue of consent, and when she finds the Islamic legal tradition lacking in allowing for a woman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>consent</b> in marriage, she calls for Muslim women to engage in acts of 2 ̆ 2 personal reflection. 2 ̆ 2 This creates a binary concerning agency, wherein external norms (The Islamic Legal tradition) suppress agency, while true agency is only found in acting in accordance with internally felt desires. This thesis investigates the reasons why Ali folds into ideas of personal reflection to reconcile Islamic understandings of marriage with contemporary Western views. In order to do this, I explore Ali 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to the Islamic Tradition 2 ̆ 7 s ability to change to incorporate consent in marriage, and how she fails to substantiate such flexibility and adaptability. Secondly, I argue that calling for 2 ̆ 2 personal reflection 2 ̆ 2 depends on notions of the authentic self, wherein the self holds inner depths and wisdom. In the second part of this thesis, I explore how the combined scholarship of Saba Mahmood and Ludwig Wittgenstein can provide enriched ways to understand agency. Through Mahmood 2 ̆ 7 s scholarship on the women 2 ̆ 7 s mosque movement in Egypt, she argues for a view of the self and desires as malleable through discipline. Building on this, Wittgenstein 2 ̆ 7 s theory of language games demonstrates how the discipline and outward action shape the rules of the language games, or rather, the norms of a society...|$|R
