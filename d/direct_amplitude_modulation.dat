40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{possibilities}} to extend the direct modulation bandwidth in dual-longitudinal-mode distributed feedback lasers by exploiting the photon-photon resonance induced by {{the interaction of the}} two modes in the laser cavity. The effects on the <b>direct</b> <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> and on the direct modulation of the difference frequency between the two modes are analyzed using simulation and experimental results. When the photon-photon resonance, which occurs at the difference frequency between the two modes, is properly placed at a higher frequency than the carrier-photon resonance, the small-signal amplitude modulation (AM) bandwidth of the laser can be significantly increased. However, both simulations and experiments point out that a high small-signal AM bandwidth does not lead to a high large-signal AM bandwidth if the small-signal modulation response has significant variations across the modulation bandwidth. The paper shows that a high large-signal AM bandwidth is obtained when the two modes are significantly unbalanced, whereas a high-bandwidth difference frequency modulation can be best detected when the two modes are balanced and the DC bias is properly chosen...|$|E
40|$|Wavelength {{modulation}} spectroscopy (WMS) with {{tunable diode}} lasers (TDLs) {{is the preferred}} technique for gas composition measurement in {{a growing number of}} industrial process control applications. Those systems using optical fiber cables or networks to address single or multiple sensing points are of particular interest. However, the conventional approaches suffer from a number of calibration / scaling factor issues which, although addressable, lead to added cost and accumulated errors in the final determination of gas concentration. Such issues are particularly problematic in industrial applications where the pressure may be varying and unknown. The target signal in WMS is an <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> (AM) component generated by the interaction of frequency modulation (FM) on the laser output with a rotational / vibrational gas absorption line function. However, <b>direct</b> laser <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> is also present and distorts the recovered target signals again leading to errors. Here we report an alternative approach in which we exploit the phase difference between the laser AM and the FM to provide direct recovery of the absolute gas absorption line function from which both the gas concentration and the pressure may be obtained from the depth and line width respectively. The method is absolute with no need for calibration thus eliminating the difficulties with the conventional approach. In our presentation, we report the basic principles of the technique and its experimental validation through a number of methane gas concentration and pressure measurements...|$|R
