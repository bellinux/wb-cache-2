40|$|The {{effect of}} noise {{exposure}} on the inner ear is well documented. However, the sensitivity to noise-induced damage varies with animal species. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to generate a hearing loss dose-response curve for a 20 -day white noise exposure in the Sprague-Dawley rat. Eight male rats were exposed to 110, 100, 95 or 85 dB sound pressure level (SPL) for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks in a sound-attenuated chamber fitted with a bank of overhead speakers. Controls were placed in an identical chamber without speakers. Four weeks after the exposure period ended, brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) thresholds were recorded in all rats at 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and 0. 5 kHz. Rats were then killed and cochlear tissues were processed for surface preparation. Hair cells were counted. Outer hair cell loss in the organ of Corti was observed in rats exposed to 95, 100, and 110 dB. Summary cytocochleograms were prepared for each rat by graphing the percentage of all hair cells remaining vs the percentage of distance along the basilar membrane as measured from the apex. The summary cytocochleograms were averaged and the area above this curve, corresponding to hair cell loss, was calculated. BAER threshold elevations (dB) were converted into percentage loss overall hearing function. Noise exposure level (dB) and (1) percentage area above the group average summary cytocochleogram and (2) percentage hearing loss were plotted as dose-response curves. Log-probit analysis was used to calculate ED 50 noise exposure levels of 117 and 104 dB (SPL), (1), and (2), respectively.

40|$|This study {{addressed}} {{the effects of}} fluconazole and 5 -fluorocytosine on the candidacidal activity of amphotericin B {{in the presence of}} human serum. A Candida albicans isolate that was susceptible to all three agents according to standard testing procedures was employed. Fungicidal activity was estimated by using a flow cytometric procedure that exploited the fact that yeast cells killed by amphotericin B diminish in size and take up propidium iodide. The following findings were made. (i) Fluconazole and 5 -fluorocytosine each failed to inhibit pseudohyphal formation and cell aggregation even when applied at 10 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively, for up to 10 h. Hence, these agents were not fungistatic when tested in the presence of serum. (ii) Simultaneous application of 5 -fluorocytosine had neither enhancing nor inhibitory effects on the fungicidal activity of amphotericin B. However, yeasts that were preincubated for 20 h with 5 -fluorocytosine became less susceptible to killing by amphotericin B. (iii) Fluconazole exerted a <b>frank</b> antagonistic <b>effect</b> on the fungicidal activity of amphotericin B.

40|$|Soy {{is known}} to produce estrogenic isoflavones. Here, we briefly review the {{evidence}} for binding of isoflavones to the estrogen receptor, in vivo estrogenicity and developmental toxicity, and estrogen developmental carcinogenesis in rats. Genistein, the major soy isoflavone, also has a <b>frank</b> estrogenic <b>effect</b> in women. We then focus on evidence from animal and human studies suggesting a link between soy consumption and goiter, an activity independent of estrogenicity. Iodine deficiency greatly increases soy antithyroid effects, whereas iodine supplementation is protective. Thus, soy effects on the thyroid involve the critical relationship between iodine status and thyroid function. In rats consuming genistein-fortified diets, genistein was measured in the thyroid at levels that produced dose-dependent and significant inactivation of rat and human thyroid peroxidase (TPO) in vitro. Furthermore, rat TPO activity was dose-dependently reduced by up to 80 %. Although these effects are clear and reproducible, other measures of thyroid function in vivo (serum levels of triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone; thyroid weight; and thyroid histopathology) were all normal. Additional factors appear necessary for soy to cause overt thyroid toxicity. These clearly include iodine deficiency but may also include additional soy components, other defects of hormone synthesis, or additional goitrogenic dietary factors. Although safety testing of natural products, including soy products, is not required, the possibility that widely consumed soy products may cause harm in the human population via either or both estrogenic and goitrogenic activities is of concern. Rigorous, high-quality experimental and human research into soy toxicity {{is the best way}} to address these concerns. Similar studies in wildlife populations are also appropriate.

Unless the initial concentration of iron was reduced below 0. 035 μg/ml, the effect on the yield was comparatively small. Below this concentration, growth was approximately linear and the yield was proportional to the amount of iron present; these cultures underwent a second phase of growth about 24 hr after the original cessation of growth, the growth being slower than before and accompanied by increase in length of the bacteria. Zinc (0. 10 μg/ml) was usually inhibitory during the first growth phase, but induced an earlier and more rapid second growth phase; it greatly increased the degree of filament formation.

40|$|We {{explore the}} design and {{implementation}} of Frank, a strict functional programming language with a bidirectional effect type system designed {{from the ground up}} around a novel variant of Plotkin and Pretnar's effect handler abstraction. Effect handlers provide an abstraction for modular effectful programming: a handler acts as an interpreter for a collection of commands whose interfaces are statically tracked by the type system. However, Frank eliminates the need for an additional effect handling construct by generalising the basic mechanism of functional abstraction itself. A function is simply the special case of a Frank operator that interprets no commands. Moreover, Frank's operators can be multihandlers which simultaneously interpret commands from several sources at once, without disturbing the direct style of functional programming with values. <b>Effect</b> typing in <b>Frank</b> employs a novel form of effect polymorphism which avoid mentioning effect variables in source code. This is achieved by propagating an ambient ability inwards, rather than accumulating unions of potential effects outwards.

40|$|Excerpt] 2 ̆ 2 Despite {{the nearly}} {{universal}} {{adoption of the}} linear nonthreshold dose response model (LNT) as the primary basis for radiation protection standards for the past half century, the LNT remains highly controversial and a contentious topic of discussion among health physicists, radiation biologists, and other radiological scientists. Indeed, it has been {{pointed out that the}} LNT has assumed the status of a paradigm, synonymous with an ideal, standard, or paragon or perhaps to some, a sacred cow. Reduced to its very basics, the LNT postulates that every increment of ionizing radiation dose, however small, carries with it a commensurate increase in the chance or risk that the exposed individual will suffer some undesirable radiation effect, and that the risk thus incurred is directly proportional or linearly related to the dose. The specific effects are termed “stochastic,” which has been defined as “of a random or statistical nature. ” Stochastic or probabilistic effects of radiation may occur as a result of low doses and are generally taken to be cancers (including leukemias) and genetic defects in the progeny. The severity of these radiation-induced stochastic effects, should they occur, are independent of the dose that produced them; thus, even though the likelihood or probability of an occurrence may be small to negligible, any and all manifestations of a radiation induced stochastic effect will have equal severity. By contrast, higher doses of radiation are known to produce characteristic somatic or deterministic effects including erythema, epilation, sterility, diminution of blood cell counts, cataracts and, in very high exposures, acute and chronic radiation syndromes. Such <b>frank</b> biological <b>effects</b> are nonstochastic in nature (in fact, they were at one time termed “nonstochastic effects”) and will always be manifested once a particular minimum dose – i. e., a “threshold” – has been received. The severity of the effect is related to the dose. Below the threshold dose there will be no demonstrable effect; as the dose increases beyond the threshold, so does the severity of the effect, or the degree of harm. … The purpose of the above discussion is to illustrate the underlying controversy and confusion that surrounds the LNT today, as well to underscore the lack of precision that sometimes accompanies the arguments of both the proponents and opponents of the LNT. Given that the LNT is a low dose phenomenon, there needs to at least be consensus on what is low dose, and such a consensus needs also to include consideration of other relevant and important factors such as the dose rate and specific stochastic end point (i. e., type of cancer or mutation). With this as a backdrop, the historical development and gyrations that led to the LNT as it is currently applied (or, some would say, misapplied) in radiological protection can be examined in the context of current scientific thinking with respect to radiation effects. It is not {{the purpose of this paper}} to endorse any particular position or to take sides but rather to present the story in a factual and fair minded manner. Hopefully, what follows will successfully achieve this goal. Thus, this paper will briefly review the scientific bases and supporting studies that led to the development and acceptance of the LNT in health physics. It will briefly touch on such topics as hormesis and other studies, such as the classic work of the late Robley Evans, that clearly demonstrate a threshold and nonlinear response for certain stochastic effects such as osteogenic sarcoma, along with the plethora of studies that suggest or have been interpreted to indicate that for at least some end points (i. e., cancers), response to ionizing radiation is consistent with the LNT model. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Electrocardiographic changes {{caused by}} {{electrical}} stimulation of individual cardiac sym-pathetic nerves were observed with Frank's corrected orthogonal lead system and <b>Frank's</b> vetorcardiogram. The <b>effects</b> of drugs on nervous stimulation and the electrocardiographic changes after the resection of the cardiac nerves were investigated in 45 closed chest dogs. The following results were obtained: 1. The amplitude of the Twave decreased in Y lead and increased in Z lead in 20 out of 34 {{cases in which}} the right stellate ganglion [R. S. G. (A) ] had been stimulated and in all {{cases in which the}} right recurrent cardiac nerve (R. Rec. C. N.) and the left ventromedial cervical cardiac nerve (L. V. M. C. N.) had been stimulated. Spatial maximum T vector displaced anteriorly and superiorly. The magnitude of spatial maximum T vector increased in all cases. 2. An increase in the amplitude of T waves in Y lead was seen in all cases in which the left stellate ganglion (L. S. G.), and the left ventrolateral cervical cardiac nerve (L. V. L. C. N.) had been stimulated, and in 14 out of 34 cases in which the right stellate ganglion [R. S. G. (B) ] had been stimulated. The spatial maximum T vector was displaced inferiorly. The magnitude of the spatial maximum T vector increased in all cases. 3. The amplitude of the T wave increased in Y lead with simultaneous stimulation of both right and left stellate ganglia. The spatial maximum T vector was displaced inferiorly and the magnitude of the spatial maximum T vector increased in all cases. These electrocardiographic changes were similar to the changes which occurred with single L. S. G. stimulation. 4. Rotation of the T loop in the left saggital plane was clockwise in more than 80 % of cases with R. S. G. stimu-lation. However, rotation of the T loop in left saggital plane was counter clockwise in more than 75 - 80 % of cases with L. S. G. and simultaneous stimulation of both right and left stellate ganglia. These results suggest that right and left cardiac sympathetic nerves innervate different myocardial areas and affect the local myocardial action potentials to cause these electrocardiographic changes. 5. In more than 40 % of cases with stimulation of left cardiac sympathetic nerves (L. S. G., L. V. L. C. N.). arrythmias such as A-V dissociation and A-V junc-tional rythm were recognized. In more than 90 % of cases with stimulation of right cardiac sympathetic nerves (R. S. G., R. Rec. C. N.), marked increase of sinus rythm occurred. 6. These electrocardiographic changes resulting from nervous stimulation decreased or disappeared after the use of propranolol. These results suggest that these electrocardiographic changes were caused by β -effects of catecholamines. 7. The QT ratio corrected by the formula of Bazett increased in all cases of right and left cardiac sympathetic nervous stimulation. 8. Long term observations after right or left stellate ganglionectomy revealed no significant changes in electrocardiographic patterns and a tendency to decrease in the QT ratio corrected by the formula of Bazett...|$|R
