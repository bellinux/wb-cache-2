5|$|The He 111 was a {{twin-engine}} {{version of}} the Blitz, preserving the elliptical inverted gull wing, small rounded control surfaces and BMW engines, so that the new design was often called the Doppel-Blitz ("Double Lightning"). When the Dornier Do 17 displaced the He 70, Heinkel needed a twin-engine design to match its competitors. Heinkel spent 200,000 man hours <b>designing</b> <b>the</b> He 111. The fuselage length was extended to just over 17.4m/57ft (from 11.7m/38ft 4½in) and wingspan to 22.6m/74ft (from 14.6m/48ft).|$|E
5|$|The bridge's Whipple truss {{technology}} {{was developed by}} civil engineer Squire Whipple in 1847. J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 by <b>designing</b> <b>the</b> first truss bridge with pinned eyebar connections. The design of the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge incorporates Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords, and is therefore considered a Whipple–Murphy truss bridge. The Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge is West Virginia's oldest remaining example of a Whipple truss bridge and its oldest extant metal truss bridge.|$|E
