25|$|On railway lines where {{rolling stock}} always points the same way, the {{mechanical}} hook may be provided only on one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> each <b>wagon.</b> Similarly, the hand brake handles {{may also be}} on one side <b>of</b> the <b>wagons</b> only.|$|R
2500|$|A {{draw gear}} is the {{assembly}} behind the coupling at each <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon</b> {{to take care}} of the compression and tension forces between the <b>wagons</b> <b>of</b> trains. [...] Early draw gears were made of wood, which was gradually replaced by steel.|$|R
50|$|Identical to {{the type}} 4 series in most ways, the only design change at this point was the {{addition}} of a second trap door for meat bars, at the opposite <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon.</b>|$|R
50|$|Between 1929 and 1934, it is {{believed}} that vans 121-191 and 369-392 were converted to the TFM class; the differences being only two ice hatches placed closer to the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagons,</b> and modifications to allow more meat to be held inside the wagons.|$|R
60|$|From {{the front}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon</b> Dick Arbuckle shifted {{back to the}} rear. Here the same dreary outlook of storm, mud and {{flapping}} canvases presented itself. Not {{so much as a}} stray dog was in sight, and the nearest wagon was twenty feet away.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} me doubtfully, but obeyed, having seen nothing. If he had seen I {{knew that he would}} have been off. I nipped round to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon,</b> calling to the other two boys to let the oxen be a while and come to me.|$|R
60|$|He {{wasted no}} time. With a hook-like clutch {{that was almost}} a blow, so swift was it, he flung me bodily out <b>of</b> the rear <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon.</b> I had barely time to crawl out from under when father, mother, and the baby came down pell-mell where I had been.|$|R
60|$|Then, without {{daring to}} stop longer, lest he should betray {{some sign of}} weakness, Dick rode away, waving his hand to Margie, who was looking out <b>of</b> the rear <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon,</b> but giving vent to a sigh which was almost a sob when {{they could no longer}} see him.|$|R
50|$|In 1807 {{and again}} in 1808 a railway or {{tramroad}} connection was proposed, and at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 1808 a <b>wagon</b> ferry at Redbrook was suggested.|$|R
60|$|Matt led the horse, and on {{more than}} one {{occasion}} had to place his shoulder to the rear <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon</b> to help over a particularly bad spot. Thus they moved on, taking half an hour to cover a distance which had previously been traveled in less than half that time.|$|R
25|$|Only {{some kinds}} of {{couplings}} coexist on the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>wagon</b> at the same time, because amongst other reasons {{they need to be}} at the same height. For example, in the Australian state of Victoria, engines had the AAR coupler, with buffers, and the chain mounted on a lug cast into the AAR coupler.|$|R
50|$|Elizabeth now {{feels she}} has finally repaid Frail in full. Rune slips the noose off, and Elizabeth turns to walk away. Frail calls out her name. She turns back, and {{steps to the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon.</b> He kneels down, cups her chin with both hands, and they touch foreheads, while a ballad plays in the background.|$|R
6000|$|... "When you've {{got enough}} {{advertising}} capital--say a roll {{as big as}} the little <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>wagon</b> tongue--there's money in matrimonial agencies. We had about $6,000 and we expected to double it in two months, which is about as long as a scheme like ours can be carried on without taking out a New Jersey charter.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{conditions}} and terms and methods of carriage of live animals in railway traffic. Live animals can be accepted for carriage in cages or without them, only with appropriate accompanying veterinary/sanitary papers. Transport must be organized in conformance with respective rules and precaution measures {{in order to have}} animals reach destination unharmed and alive. During transport adequate care is taken about fodder and water, airing and cleanliness <b>of</b> <b>wagons,</b> while at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> carriage <b>wagons</b> are obligatorily disinfected. </p...|$|R
50|$|Three vans, no's 347, 420 and 431 ZL, were {{exclusively}} {{allocated to}} the Cudgewa line, for stock specials. These vans had been fitted with extra vents and berths for cattle drover accommodation. A further two vans were allocated to standard gauge, and were used on either <b>end</b> <b>of</b> NN <b>wagons</b> on the ballast trains during construction of the new Albury line.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wagons</b> <b>of</b> {{this type}} {{measured}} 21 ft over buffers with the axles at 10 ft spacing, and were rated for 10 LT load. A little under half the group, 1 through 112, were fitted with single roofs and single louvres; the remainder, 113-277, 279 and 280, were fitted with double-roofs {{as a form}} of shade, and double-louvres for strength. The second roof was slightly larger, overhanging the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon</b> body by about an inch on either end.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} types of trains in Seoul but they are usually similar to each other. Typically, train cars have four doors on each side. In between the doors are rows of either {{cushioned}} or non-cushioned seats for 7 people, except for the outer <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> each <b>wagon</b> where there are smaller rows of seats for 3 people, marked for the use by the elderly, disabled passengers, and pregnant women.|$|R
6000|$|... "Three palefaced children," [...] she gasped, [...] "were {{reading it}} in the tail- <b>end</b> <b>of</b> an {{emigrant}} <b>wagon.</b> I crept up to them softly. Their parents are still unaware of the accident," [...] and she sank helpless at his feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "All ready there!" [...] {{shouted the}} marshals with grandiloquent {{gestures}} of their be-ribboned rods, the band blared {{out again and}} the teams began {{to move toward the}} west. The men stood up to look ahead, while the boys in the back <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagons</b> craned perilously {{over the edge of the}} box to see how long the line was. It seemed enormous to them, and their admiration of the marshals broke forth in shrill cries of primitive wildness.|$|R
50|$|This flat wagon, {{built from}} 1928, was longer and, at 40 tons, {{also had a}} higher maximum load than its Verbandsbauart {{predecessor}} based on technical drawing A3. The most obvious new feature was the fish belly girder. All wagons had a hand brake. On the welded versions which appeared from 1934 there was an open, foldaway brakeman's platform instead of the brakeman's cab (secondary letter a), {{in order to be}} able to transport longer loads over the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon.</b>|$|R
50|$|Vans {{built over}} the 1888-1925 period were {{constructed}} with a single trap door installed in place of louvres at one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon,</b> while later wagons were fitted with a trap door at each end. The trap doors {{were used for the}} insertion of long metal bars, which could be used for hanging meat. When wagons were going through regular maintenance in the 1960s' the trap doors were either welded shut or the entire end panel was replaced with a new section of only louvres.|$|R
60|$|So I gave in, and {{presently}} {{saw their}} fires beginning to burn through the <b>end</b> canvas <b>of</b> the <b>wagon</b> which was unlaced because {{the night was}} hot. Also later on I woke up, about midnight I think, and heard voices talking, one of which I reflected sleepily, sounded very like that of Footsack.|$|R
25|$|In some countries, convicts are transported from {{court to}} prison or from one prison to another by railway. In such {{transportation}} {{a specific type}} of coach, prisoner car, is used. It contains several cell compartments with minimal interior and commodities, and a separate guard compartment. Usually the windows are of nontransparent opaque glass to prevent prisoners from seeing outside and determine where they are, and windows usually also have bars to prevent escapes. Unlike other passenger cars, prisoner cars do not have doors at the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Signs {{mark the}} {{location}} of the post office and the blacksmith shop that stayed open all night to fix broken horseshoes. An 1879 article in Harper's Monthly described the wagons as [...] "so numerous that the leaders of one team had their noses in the trough at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the next <b>wagon</b> ahead." ...|$|R
50|$|Two brake vans of {{interest}} were numbers FB578 and FB579. These were 'flat' brake vans, converted from flat wagons. The conversion consisted {{of building a}} small guard's compartment on one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the flat <b>wagon.</b> Therefore, these wagons {{could be used for}} carrying small items, such as sleepers, in addition to their role as a brake van.|$|R
5000|$|The {{implementation}} of these guidelines is partly binding and partly voluntary {{for members of}} the UIC. Since the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 1977, flat <b>wagons</b> that partially conform to these guidelines are identified by the designation [...] "UIC". Flat beds that comply fully with the leaflets, and are therefore true UIC standard wagons, are given the designation [...] "UIS St".|$|R
50|$|Following the {{experiments}} with the S.A.R. M type vans, {{it was decided}} to purchase a pair <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> from the American Car & Foundry, USA, for further testing. These two were similar in design to S.A.R. wagons, except with a louvre design rather than a plain boxcar design. The two vans were delivered as kits in 1925 and assembled at Newport Workshops, becoming vans V1 and V2. As the tests proved successful, the VR constructed a further 80 wagons over the period 1927-1929. These vans were of a similar design, but with a corrugated roof placed on in lieu of the sheet steel design, to better suit Australian conditions. Vans numbered 51 and above were fitted with twin doors per side at one-third in from the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagons,</b> rather than a single central door.|$|R
50|$|On railway lines where {{rolling stock}} always points the same way, the {{mechanical}} hook may be provided only on one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> each <b>wagon.</b> This was {{the situation on}} the Lynton & Barnstaple (L&B), a narrow gauge line in Devon, England, and still applies to railways in New Zealand and on the Isle of Man Railway. Similarly, the hand brake handles may also be on one side <b>of</b> the <b>wagons</b> only. The L&B originally used side chains in conjunction with Norwegian couplers, but these were found to be unnecessary with the slow speeds employed (15 - 25 km/h) and were removed within a year or so of the line opening in 1898. The Isle of Man Railway still couples its side chains in operation today.|$|R
50|$|Within a year, the {{controller}} had become {{larger and more}} complex. A breadboard electronic version complete with sensor amplifiers and large control modules consumed the entire back <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a station <b>wagon.</b> Input data came from variable reluctance sensors installed at the front drive shaft, rear drive shaft, throttle, brakes, and steering. The goal was to control clutch actuation by controlling current.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the entry}} of the USA into World War I on 6 April 1917, Hoople volunteered to {{minister}} to the troops of the American Expeditionary Force with the YMCA. He was appointed a secretary of the National War Council of the Y.M.C.A. of the USA. On 18 May 1918 Hoople sailed for France. While in France, Hoople worked incessantly at the front lines as an entertainer, where he not only raised {{the spirits of the}} troops with [...] "his melodious singing", but also led many soldiers to Christ. Hoople preached [...] "in barns, buildings that had been shot to pieces, from the tail <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons,</b> and auto trucks. His great voice led them many times in singing the old hymns that reminded them of home and sacred things. He won the hearts of thousands of those laddies, until he was commonly known among the regiment as 'Pop'." [...] While on the front lines, Hoople was exposed to poisonous gas, and his health was subsequently damaged {{for the rest of his}} life. He was subsequently stationed in Italy and Germany, before returning to Brooklyn and his ministry at the John Wesley Pentecostal Church of the Nazarene. However, by 1919 Hoople was the pastor of the Utica Avenue Pentecostal Tabernacle that he had founded in 1894, and Rev. A.E. Reid was listed as the pastor at John Wesley church.|$|R
50|$|Miège {{conducted}} extensive pastoral visitations {{throughout the}} wild and remote regions over which his congregation was scattered, visiting the Indian villages, forts, trading posts, and growing towns and celebrating Mass on the rear <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his <b>wagon.</b> He also founded a girls' school for the Osages, placing it {{under the care of}} the Sisters of Loretto. In August 1855, he established his episcopal see at the prosperous city of Leavenworth in order to better minister to the growing number of white settlers there. As the number of churches and schools increased, Nebraska was formed into a separate vicariate in 1857 and the Kansas Territory was left under Miège's jurisdiction.|$|R
60|$|We left {{late in the}} {{day with}} intent to camp at the little village of White Pass, which was the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wagon</b> road and some twelve miles away. We moved out of town along a road lined with refuse, camp-bottoms, ruined cabins, tin cans, and broken bottles,--all the {{unsightly}} debris of the rush of May and June. A part of the way had been corduroyed, for which I was exceedingly grateful, for the Skagway River roared savagely under our feet, while {{on either side of the}} roadway at other points I could see abysses of mud which, in the growing darkness, were sufficiently menacing.|$|R
50|$|A brakeman's cabin (also brakeman's cab) or brakeman's caboose (US) {{was a small}} one-man {{compartment}} at one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{a railway}} <b>wagon</b> to provide shelter for the brakeman from the weather and in which equipment for manually operating the wagon brake was located. They {{were built in the}} days before continuous braking was available and the locomotive brake needed to be augmented by brakemen applying the wagon brakes individually.|$|R

A long row of arches {{supports}} the roof over the exterior corridor {{on the right}} side of the building. Part of another building is visible to the north (left) behind the cloister. A small slanted wooden structure (scaffold?) is visible at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the cloister. <b>Wagon</b> tracks are visible in the dirt in the foreground...|$|R
50|$|Like the 1958 Yeoman 2-door. The 1959 & '60 Brookside 2-doors, are {{preferred}} by hotrodders and collectors over their 4-door counterparts. The two-door variant {{would become the}} basis for the new-for-1959 El Camino. Unlike the Brookwood, the El Camino could be ordered in trim levels corresponding to the entire full-sized car line including the Impala. 1960 marked the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Chevy's full size 2-door <b>wagons,</b> and the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 2-door Chevy <b>wagons</b> all together until the 1964 Chevelle 300 2-door wagon.|$|R
50|$|The FE-DOHC is the 16 valve DOHC {{variant of}} the FE. Commonly called the FE3 because of its head castings, it was used in some 626s from Europe, New Zealand and Japan; but not the U.S. or Australia. After the GD {{platform}} stopped production in 1992, FE-DOHCs continued production until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the GV <b>wagon</b> in 1997. The FE-DOHC was also produced under license by Kia for the 1995+ Kia Sportage.|$|R
