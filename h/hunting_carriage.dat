50|$|In 1819 on 16 August, a vast orderly {{concourse}} {{of working}} men and women assembled on St. Peter's field around what's now St Peters Square on the then outskirts Manchester. Fildes along with other female activists including Elizabeth Gaunt & Sarah Hargreaves were to be placed on the platform or in <b>Hunts</b> <b>carriage</b> holding the flags and banners of the society's represented.|$|R
50|$|The {{exhibition}} {{concentrates on}} coaches and sleighs from the 18th to the 20th century {{that belonged to}} Basel family estate. It documents transport, mobility and is an attest to the excellent workmanship of Basel's coachbuilders during this period. Shown are further attractions such as <b>hunting</b> <b>carriages,</b> dog carts, phaetons, coup√©s and landaus, as well as mail coaches, commercial horse-drawn vehicles, children's coaches and sleighs. Further exhibits are, for example, accessories such as harnesses and coachmen's liveries.|$|R
50|$|The magistrates fearing {{unrest and}} anarchy then gave {{orders to the}} Manchester and Salford Yeomanry. A number of the orderly {{concourse}} were killed and several hundred were seriously wounded. Mary Fildes was wounded severely while riding on the box sear of Henry <b>Hunt's</b> <b>carriage.</b> In the confusion of the massacre she tumbled off the carriage seat. Eye-witness account 'Mrs. Fildes hanging suspended by a nail on the platform of the carriage had caught her white dress. She was slashed across her exposed body by {{an officer of the}} cavalry'.|$|R
60|$|Their next {{movement}} was to cross to Brooklyn. Here the pair {{started on the}} <b>hunt</b> for the <b>carriage</b> that had carried Nellie Ardell off.|$|R
500|$|<b>Hunt's</b> <b>carriage</b> {{arrived at}} the meeting shortly after 1:00pm, and {{he made his way}} to the hustings. Alongside Hunt on the speakers' stand were John Knight, a cotton {{manufacturer}} and reformer, Joseph Johnson, the organiser of the meeting, John Thacker Saxton, managing editor of the Manchester Observer, the publisher Richard Carlile, and George Swift, reformer and shoemaker. There were also a number of reporters, including John Tyas of The Times, John Smith of the Liverpool Mercury and Edward Baines Jr, the son of the editor of the Leeds Mercury. By this time St Peter's Field, an area of , was packed with tens of thousands of men, women and children. The crowd around the speakers was so dense that [...] "their hats seemed to touch"; large groups of curious spectators gathered on the outskirts of the crowd. The rest of Manchester was like a ghost town, the streets and shops were empty.|$|R
500|$|Although some observers, {{like the}} Rev. W. R. Hay, {{chairman}} of the Salford Quarter Sessions, claimed that [...] "The active part of the meeting {{may be said to}} have come in wholly from the country", others such as John Shuttleworth, a local cotton manufacturer, estimated that most were from Manchester, a view that would subsequently be supported by the casualty lists. Of the casualties whose residence was recorded, sixty-one per cent lived within a three-mile radius of the centre of Manchester. Some groups carried banners with texts like [...] "No Corn Laws", [...] "Annual Parliaments", [...] "Universal suffrage" [...] and [...] "Vote By Ballot". The first female reform societies were established in the textile areas in 1819 and women from the Manchester Female Reform Society, dressed in white, accompanied Hunt to the platform. The society's president Mary Fildes rode in <b>Hunt's</b> <b>carriage</b> carrying its flag. The only banner known to have survived is in Middleton Public Library; it was carried by Thomas Redford, who was injured by a yeomanry sabre. Made of green silk embossed with gold lettering, one side of the banner is inscribed [...] "Liberty and Fraternity" [...] and the other [...] "Unity and Strength".|$|R
5000|$|Outside {{the garden}} {{there are a}} few {{straight}} scenic avenues, for following the <b>hunt</b> in a <b>carriage,</b> or purely for the vista afforded by an avenue. Few of the [...] "green rooms" [...] cut into the woodlands in imitation of the cabinets de verdure of Versailles that are shown in the engraving actually got executed at Het Loo.|$|R

They formed two lines in the crowd a few yards apart, in an attempt to form a corridor through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two waggons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the waggons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.|$|R
6000|$|... "And stay there," [...] {{echoed the}} Baron. It was so {{significantly}} said, that her face changed; and the schemer, {{fearful of the}} sinister ambiguity of his expressions, hastened to explain. [...] "This time he shall go <b>hunting</b> in a <b>carriage,</b> with a good escort of our foreign lancers. His destination shall be the Felsenburg; it is healthy, the rock is high, the windows are small and barred; {{it might have been}} built on purpose. We shall entrust the captaincy to the Scotsman Gordon; he at least will have no scruple. Who will miss the sovereign? He is gone hunting; he came home on Tuesday, on Thursday he returned; all is usual in that. Meanwhile the war proceeds; our Prince will soon weary of his solitude; and about the time of our triumph, or, if he prove very obstinate, a little later, he shall be released upon a proper understanding, and I see him once more directing his theatricals." ...|$|R
6000|$|At length {{we came to}} two streams which {{join their}} forces, and would seem to flow across the plain {{to the bottom of}} the hills. One, however, flows so flat as almost {{scarcely}} to move, and sinking into a kind of stagnant pool is swallowed up by the earth, without proceeding any further until, after remaining buried for two or three [miles?] underground, it again bursts forth to the light, and resumes its course. When we crossed this stream by a bridge, which they are now repairing, we entered a spacious plain, very like that which we had [left] and displaying a similar rough and savage cultivation. Here savage herds were under the guardianship of shepherds as wild as they were themselves, clothed in a species of sheepskins, and carrying a sharp spear with which they herd and sometimes kill their buffaloes. Their farmhouses are in very poor order, and with every mark of poverty, and they have the character of being moved to dishonesty by anything like opportunity; of this there was a fatal instance, but so well avenged that it is not like to be repeated till it has long faded out of memory. The story, I am assured, happened exactly as follows:--A certain Mr. Hunt, lately married to a lady of his own age, and, seeming to have had what is too often the Englishman's characteristic of more money than wit, arrived at Naples a year or two ago en famille, and desirous of seeing all the sights in the vicinity of this celebrated place. Among others Paestum was not forgot. At one of the poor farmhouses where they stopped, the inhabitant set her eyes on a toilet apparatus which was composed of silver and had the appearance of great value. The woman who spread this report addressed herself to a youth who had been [under] arms, and undoubtedly he and his companions showed no more hesitation than the person with whom the idea had originated. Five fellows, not known before this time for any particular evil, agreed to rob the English gentleman of the treasure of which he had made such an imprudent display. They were attacked by the banditti in several parties, but the principal attack was directed to Mr. <b>Hunt's</b> <b>carriage,</b> a servant of that gentleman being, as well as himself, pulled out of the carriage and watched by those who had undertaken to conduct this bad deed. The man who had been the soldier, probably to keep up his courage, began to bully, talk violently, and strike the valet de place, who screamed out in a plaintive manner, [...] "Do not injure me." [...] His master, hoping to make some impression, said, [...] "Do not hurt my servant," [...] to which the principal brigand replied, [...] "If he dares to resist, shoot him." [...] The man who stood over Mr. Hunt unfortunately took the captain at the word, and his shot mortally wounded the unfortunate gentleman and his wife, who both died next day at our landlady's, Miss Whyte, who had the charity to receive them that they might hear their own language on their deathbed. The Neapolitan Government made the most uncommon exertions. The whole of the assassins were taken within a fortnight, and executed within a week afterwards. In this wild spot, rendered unpleasing by the sad remembrance of so inhuman an accident, and the cottages which served for refuge for so wretched and wild a people, exist the celebrated ruins of Paestum. Being without arms of any kind, the situation was a dreary one, and though I can scarce expect now to defend myself effectually, yet the presence of [illegible] would have been an infinite cordial. The ruins are of very great antiquity, which for a very long time has not been suspected, as it was never supposed that the Sybarites, a luxurious people, were early possessed of a style of architecture simple, chaste, and inconceivably grand, which was lost before the time of Augustus, who is said by Suetonius to have undertaken a journey on purpose to visit these remains of an architecture, the most simple and massive of which Italy at least has any other specimen. The Greeks have specimens of the same kind, but they are composed not of stone, like Paestum, but of marble. All this has been a discovery of recent date. The ruins, which exist without exhibiting much demolition, are three in number. The first is a temple of immense size, having a portico of the largest columns of the most awful species of classic architecture. The roof, which was composed of immense stones, was destroyed, but there are remains of the Cella, contrived for the sacrifices to which the priests and persons of high office were alone [admitted].|$|R
