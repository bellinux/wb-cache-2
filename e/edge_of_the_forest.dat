The castle is predominantly built of local old red sandstone and limestone. The castle site is surrounded by an in-filled moat; now a garden, the moat was originally wet and fed by a spring underneath the moat itself.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{elevation}} forests contain whitebark pine, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and limber pine, including the largest individual whitebark pine in North America. Based on tree ring chronologies, {{some of the}} whitebark pines {{are believed to be}} 700 to 1000 or more years old. The {{highest elevation}} forests typically have understories of grasses and forbs that are resistant to freezing at any point of the growing season. Willows, alders, cottonwoods, and sedges are found in riparian areas. Ponderosa pine occupy the dry, lower elevations near the western <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> and historically persisted due to the occurrence of frequent non-lethal fires. Ponderosa pine forest understories typically consist of perennial grasses such as Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass. In the slightly moister ponderosa pine forests grasses such as pinegrass are found with a cover of shrubs including white spirea, common snowberry, and mallow ninebark.|$|E
25|$|Since 1961, the Tijuca National Park (Parque Nacional da Tijuca), {{the largest}} city-surrounded urban forest {{and the second}} largest urban forest in the world, has been a National Park. The largest urban forest {{in the world is}} the Floresta da Pedra Branca (White Rock Forest), which is also located in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro. The Pontifical Catholic University of Rio (Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro or PUC-Rio), Brazil's top private university, is located at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> in the Gávea district.

25|$|The Sultan's Copper Tents, {{originally}} three {{buildings for}} the palace guard, {{designed by the}} painter Louis Jean Desprez and built during 1787 to 1790. Desprez proposed that all the façades of the buildings should be designed as three Turkish tents, clad in decoratively painted copper plate. However, tent façades were only built on the side facing the main lawns, which still gives the desired illusion of a sultan's encampment on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Birmingham in England spans 1400 years of growth, {{during which time}} it has evolved from a small 7th century Anglo Saxon hamlet on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> of Arden at the fringe of early Mercia to become a major city through a {{combination}} of immigration, innovation and civic pride that helped to bring about major social and economic reforms and to create the Industrial Revolution, inspiring the growth of similar cities across the world.|$|E

25|$|After daybreak on {{the morning}} of 26 December, {{servicemen}} returned to a small clearing near the eastern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> and found three small impressions in a triangular pattern, as well as burn marks and broken branches on nearby trees. At 10:30 a.m. the local police were called out again, this time to see the impressions on the ground, which they thought could have been made by an animal. Georgina Bruni, in her book You Can't Tell the People, published a photograph of the supposed landing site taken {{on the morning}} after the first sighting.|$|E
25|$|Maria Antonia {{formally}} renounced her {{rights to}} Habsburg domains, and on 19 April {{she was married}} by proxy to the Dauphin of France at the Augustinian Church in Vienna, with her brother Archduke Ferdinand standing in for the Dauphin. On 14 May she met her husband at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> of Compiègne. Upon her arrival in France she adopted the French version of her name: Marie Antoinette. A further ceremonial wedding took place on 16 May 1770 in the Palace of Versailles and, after the festivities, the day ended with the ritual bedding. The lack of a marriage consummation plagued the reputation of both Louis-Auguste and Marie Antoinette {{for the next seven}} years.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800, the {{regiment}} {{was part of}} Emmanuel de Grouchy's division. Together with the 108th Line Infantry Regiment, the 4th Hussars opposed the Austrian advance guard as it tried {{to emerge from the}} forest. After initial Austrian success, Grouchy's troops pushed their enemies back to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> The 4th Hussars tried twice to overrun an Austrian battery and were successful on their third charge. Merlin sent a hussar squadron against some nearby infantry and sent them fleeing. From 1801–1803 he served in the garrison at Cambrai. He participated in the successful French 1803 invasion of the Electorate of Hanover which ended in the Convention of Artlenburg. Merlin {{became a member of the}} Légion d'Honneur on 11 December 1803 and an officer of the Légion on 14 June 1804.|$|E

25|$|After the lapse of the Chester earldom in 1237, {{the forest}} rights {{passed to the}} Crown and the monarch's heir was given the title of Earl of Chester. Although Edward I hunted in the forest, the sport became less important, and the forests were used for timber {{production}} and {{as a source of}} revenue from taxes, fees and fines. In 1300, Edward I confirmed Ranulf de Blondeville's charter of 1215–16, but in the mid-14th century, Edward of Woodstock, the Black Prince, introduced various restrictive measures, which led to a large number of complaints recorded in the Black Prince's Register of 1351. Agricultural exploitation of the eastern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> was hampered by outbreaks of Black Death at Over, Little Budworth and Vale Royal Abbey in 1349, 1361 and 1369. The Old Pale and Eddisbury Hill were enclosed in the 14th century, to retain deer.|$|E
25|$|As {{so often}} {{in the history of}} the abbey things did not go smoothly; {{preparing}} the site took considerable time and the first monks, led by Abbot John Chaumpeneys, did not arrive at Darnhall from Dore Abbey until 1274. The foundation of the new abbey provoked anger, resentment and strong resistance from the people of the area and the Darnhall site itself was found to be unsuitable for the huge buildings planned. In 1276 Edward, by now king, agreed to move the abbey to a better site and a location was chosen in nearby Over on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Forest</b> of Mondrem. With its foundation, the new ecclesiastical site was named Vale Royal. In 1277 the King and Queen Eleanor and numerous great nobles arrived at Over to lay the foundation stones of the new abbey. In 1281 the monks moved from Darnhall to temporary accommodation on the Vale Royal site while the abbey started to rise around them.|$|E
25|$|In January 1945 {{the brigade}} {{was in the}} Ardennes forest, in February moving to the Reichswald forest where it was {{involved}} in Operation Veritable and, despite heavy fighting in terrible confitions, managed to clear the south-western <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest.</b> The brigade, {{along with the rest}} of the division, now part of XXX Corps under Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks, had a short rest after this, and began training for their next assignment, Operation Plunder, an amphibious assault crossing of the river Rhine. The operation began on the night of 23 March 1945, with Cassels' brigade crossing the river the following day. On the same day, however, the division's GOC, Major General Rennie, was killed by mortar fire and replaced as GOC by Major General Gordon MacMillan, a highly experienced and competent commander, who had led Cassels's brigade in Sicily. Despite the loss of the GOC, the division, Cassels's brigade in particular, was involved in heavy fighting in an attempt to expand the bridgehead. The brigade then advanced across Germany, and was at Bremen by late April, with the end of World War II in Europe following shortly after.|$|E

500|$|Like the {{exterior}} of the building, the principal internal spaces are designed to make the best use of natural materials in their natural state. The structure and detail of the concourse galleries echo the form of {{the exterior}}, with the curving strata formed in native hardwoods. Oak, ash, beech, sycamore, alder, birch, chestnut and cherry woods from renewable sources in mid-Wales will be used together in proportions that reflect their relative availability from the forest. The design of the concourse galleries is intended to evoke the image of the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> partly as a counterpoint to the coastal nature of the exterior, and partly because the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> in folklore and mythology represents a line between the real world and the magical world, a line which resembles the front edge of the theatre stage. The form of trees is created by the interweaving curvature of the gallery edges, and by the random positioning of the supporting columns. —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E
500|$|Bates takes a house a {{few miles}} outside town on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest,</b> and soon starts to notice {{butterflies}} and climbing palms.

He meets a landowner who complains of {{the high price of}} slaves. There are colossal trees with buttressed trunks.|$|E
500|$|Wilkes {{sailed to}} Hilo {{on the island}} of Hawaiʻi and decided to climb Mauna Loa first, since it looked easier than Mauna Kea. On December 14 he hired about 200 porters, but after he left he {{realized}} only about half the equipment had been taken, so he had to hire more Hawaiians at higher pay. When they reached Kīlauea after two days, their guide Puhano headed off to the established ʻAinapō Trail. Wilkes did not want to head back downhill so he blazed his own way through dense forest directed by a compass. The Hawaiians were offended by the waste of sacred trees which did not help morale.

500|$|The Mikea are a {{group of}} Malagasy-speaking horticulturalists and foragers who are often {{described}} as the hunter-gatherers of Madagascar.

The Mikea are predominantly of Sakalava origin, although the term describes a lifestyle rather than an ethnic group per se, and individuals from a variety of Malagasy ethnic groups are found among the Mikea. The family encampments of the Mikea shift from prime corn planting territory at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>forest</b> in the rainy season to the interior forest rich with tenrecs and other game in the dry season, when the community becomes highly dependent on spongy tubers to meet their daily demand for water. Their lifestyle is interdependent with that of their neighboring Vezo fishermen and the Masikoro farmers and herders, with whom they trade products caught, foraged or cultivated in the forest. Many Mikea also occasionally engage in paid work such as guarding the zebu herds or tending the corn fields of others.|$|E
