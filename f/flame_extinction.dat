50|$|The {{combustion}} efficiency of most aircraft gas turbine engines {{at sea level}} takeoff conditionsis almost 100%. It decreases nonlinearly to 98% at altitude cruise conditions. Air-fuel ratio ranges from 50:1 to 130:1. For any type of combustion chamber there is a rich and weak limit to the air-fuel ratio, beyond which the flame is extinguished. The range of air-fuel ratio {{between the rich and}} weak limits is reduced with an increase of air velocity. If theincreasing air mass flow reduces the fuel ratio below certain value, <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> occurs.|$|E
50|$|Early {{jet engines}} were prone to {{flameout}} due to disturbances of inlet air, caused from gas ingestion. Fast acceleration or inappropriate throttle settings could also impoverish the fuel/air mixture causing a flameout or an excessive jet pipe temperature. However, if the throttle movements are made smoothly {{and not too}} rapidly, there was little or no risk of <b>flame</b> <b>extinction.</b> If this happened at low altitude, it would often lead to the total loss of the aircraft. However, jet engines were developed to be controlled with a governor, a centrifugal feedback valve for controlling {{the speed of the}} engine - sometimes referred to as FCU (Fuel Control Unit) or HMU (Hydro-Mechanical Unit) - allowing controlled fuel metering proportional to the engine's rotational speed. Current modern engines are engineered to a higher degree of technical quality controlled by digital electronic systems (FADEC) that constantly fine-tune their performance; thus such flameouts are not as common {{as they were in the}} early days of jet-powered aviation.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a novel overall quantitative {{description of the}} major regimes of engine combustion, covering the influences of both turbulence and auto-ignition parameters on burn rates and <b>flame</b> <b>extinctions.</b> It involves two separate, yet interconnected, correlation diagrams. The first involves the normalized turbulent burning velocity, the Karlovitz stretch factor the strain rate Markstein number, and also includes possible relative auto-ignitive burn rates. The second is a complementary correlating ξ/ɛ diagram, involving the auto-ignitive parameters of ignition delay and excitation times. The ξ parameter is the acoustic speed normalized by the auto-ignition velocity, while ɛ is the acoustic wave residence time in a hot spot, normalized by the excitation, or heat release, time. It also includes {{an indication of the}} regime of normal flame propagation. The different auto-ignitive regimes, in which a variety of contrasting fuel/air mixtures might operate, are indicated on the ξ/ɛ diagram, particularly in relation to its peninsula of developing detonation at a hot spot. Operational points, measured on a variety of engines, are also shown on the two diagrams, in terms of the different regimes, including those of mild and “super-knock”, turbulent <b>flame</b> <b>extinctions,</b> and controlled auto-ignition...|$|R

30|$|To {{identify}} the emissions of each flight, {{a detailed analysis}} is carried out in this section. Accordingly, the emissions are determined for each route due to the different distances between the departure and the arrival airports, and thereby the fuel consumptions. Each route involves five flights. As stated earlier, {{two of the five}} aircraft on each route use the CFM 56 - 7 B 26 / 3 engine, while the other three use the CFM 56 / 7 B 26. As shown in Table  2, the bypass ratio, the pressure ratio, and the thrust of these two kinds of engines are the same. Nonetheless, the combustion chamber designs differ, impacting the emission production mechanism. According to Brasseur et al., rich mixtures and the local <b>flame</b> <b>extinctions</b> in the combustion chamber are likely to induce CO and HC production, respectively [19]. This addresses the importance of the design of the primary zone of the combustion chambers, residence time of the flame, and the flame temperature [20, 21]. Also, ambient temperature could affect the engine thermal efficiency and thereby certain emission types [18].|$|R
40|$|Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of ethylene/air {{diffusion}} flame extinctions in decaying two-dimensional turbulence were performed. A Damköhler-number-based <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> criterion as provided by classical large activation energy asymptotic (AEA) theory is assessed for its validity in predicting <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> and compared to {{one based on}} Chemical Explosive Mode Analysis (CEMA) of the detailed chemistry. The DNS code solves compressible flow conservation equations using high order finite difference and explicit time integration schemes. The ethylene/air chemistry is simulated with a reduced mechanism that is generated based on the directed relation graph (DRG) based methods along with stiffness removal. The numerical configuration is an ethylene fuel strip embedded in ambient air and exposed to a prescribed decaying turbulent flow field. The emphasis {{of this study is}} on the several <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> events observed in contrived parametric simulations. A modified viscosity and changing pressure (MVCP) scheme was adopted in order to artificially manipulate the probability of <b>flame</b> <b>extinction.</b> Using MVCP, pressure was changed from the baseline case of 1 atm to 0. 1 and 10 atm. In the high pressure MVCP case, the simulated flame is extinction-free, whereas in the low pressure MVCP case, the simulated flame features frequent extinction events and is close to global extinction. Results show that, despite its relative simplicity and provided that the global flame activation temperature is correctly calibrated, the AEA-based <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> criterion can accurately predict the simulated <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> events. It is also found that the AEA-based criterion provides predictions of <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> that are consistent with those provided by a CEMA-based criterion. This study supports the validity of a simple Damköhler-number-based criterion to predict <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> in engineering-level CFD models. © 2014 The Combustion Institute...|$|E
40|$|This {{study of}} nitrogen-diluted non-premixed {{counterflow}} flames with finite burner diameters investigates {{the important role}} of the outer-edge flame on <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> through experimental and numerical analyses. It explores flame stability diagrams mapping the <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> response of nitrogen-diluted non-premixed counterflow flames to varying global strain rates in terms of burner diameter, burner gap, and velocity ratio. A critical nitrogen mole fraction exists beyond which the flame cannot be sustained; the critical nitrogen mole fraction versus global strain rate curves have C-shapes for various burner diameters, burner gaps, and velocity ratios. At sufficiently high strain-rate flames, these curves collapse into one curve; therefore, the flames follow the one-dimensional flame response of a typical diffusion flame. Low strain-rate flames are significantly affected by radial conductive heat loss, and therefore flame length. Three <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> modes are identified: <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> through shrinkage of the outer-edge flame with or without oscillations at the outer-edge flame prior to the extinction, and <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> through a flame hole at the flame center. The extinction modes are significantly affected by the behavior of the outer-edge flame. Detailed explanations are provided based on the measured flame-surface temperature and numerical evaluation of the fractional contribution of each term in the energy equation. Radial conductive heat loss at the flame edge to ambience is the main mechanism of extinction through shrinkage of the outer-edge flame in low strain-rate flames. Reduction of the burner diameter can extend the <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> mode by shrinking the outer-edge flame in higher strain-rate flames. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe fire {{behaviors}} in a compartment {{only with a}} single ceiling vent at the corner were investigated experimentally {{and the effects of}} vent size and fuel surface area on the fire development were studied in detail. The compartment was 1 m (W) × 1 m (L) × 0. 75 m (H) and the area of the ceiling vent varied in six dimensions. Fire source was n-heptane pool with three different diameters, 0. 1 m, 0. 141 m and 0. 2 m, respectively. The fuel mass loss rate, gas temperature profile and oxygen concentration in the compartment were measured and flame behaviors were recorded by a video camera. The results showed that <b>flame</b> <b>extinctions</b> were due to two factors, oxygen concentration and fuel quantity. The ceiling vent only had a small impact on the mass loss rate and gas temperature profile when the fire extinction was due to low oxygen concentration. Additionally, mass loss rates showed same values when compared to free mass loss rate for small fires, even the fire was self-extinction. The effects of oxygen concentration and hot gas temperature on mass loss rate were examined and its solution agrees well with the measurements...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{significant}} successes in the mathematical modelling of lift-off distances and plume heights of fuel jet flames, and in correlating these parameters experimentally. A dimensionless flow number, or jet velocity, has been developed, with which experimental dimensionless plume heights and flame lift-off distances {{have been successfully}} correlated. However, the prediction of blow-off heights presents significantly more difficulty. This {{is because of the}} strong non-linearities at blow-off, involving complexities of mixing, strain rates, flamelet burning velocities and curvatures, with localised <b>flame</b> <b>extinctions.</b> Because of these, it is difficult to obtain consistency in the measurement of blow-off heights. Consequently, the practice adopted by Kalghatgi of measuring dimensionless fuel jet velocities at blow-off was followed in the present study. Just before blow-off, strong instabilities and flame oscillations develop, and a correlation of blow-off is proposed in terms of the the last stable dimensionless flow number, before blow-off occurs. The study covers acetylene, commercial butanes, ethylene, hydrogen, methane and propane. Blow-off is characterised from plots of the dimensionless flame lift-off distance against the flow number for each fuel, with identification of the last stable dimensionless flow number prior to blow-off. This enables the dimensionless flow numbers for blow-off to be identified for the different fuels, along with the associated dimensionless lift-off distance...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the diffusive-thermal instability of opposed nonpremixed tubular <b>flames</b> near <b>extinction</b> limit are investigated using the linear stability analysis and 2 -D high fidelity numerical simulations. It is confirmed that the diffusive-thermal instability occurs near 1 -D extinction limit. In general, the maximum flame temperature increases with decreasing Damköhler number for cases with {{the same number of}} cells. However, the representative temperature for the flames with the same number of cells first decreases and then increases again as the Damköhler number approaches the 2 -D extinction limit...|$|R
40|$|The <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> {{limits of}} syngas (H{sub 2 }-CO) flames were {{measured}} using a twin-flame-counter-flow burner. Plots of Extinction limits vs. global stretch rates were generated at different mixture compositions and an extrapolation method {{was used to}} calculate the <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> limit corresponding to an experimentally unattainable zero-stretch condition. The zero-stretch extinction limit of H{sub 2 }-CO mixtures decreases (from rich to lean) with the increase in H{sub 2 } concentration in the mixture. The average difference between the measured <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> limit and the Le Chatelier's calculation is around {approx} 7 %. The measured OH{sup -} chemiluminescent data indicates that regardless of mixture compositions the OH radical concentration reduces (within the experimental uncertainties) to an extinction value prior to the <b>flame</b> <b>extinction.</b> <b>Flame</b> <b>extinction</b> limits of H{sub 2 }-CO mixtures measured in a flat-flame burner configuration also show a similar relation. Additionally, the measured laminar flame velocity close to the extinction indicates that regardless of fuel composition the premixed flame of hydrogen fuel blends extinguishes when the mixture laminar flame velocity falls below a critical value. The critical laminar flame velocity at extinction for H{sub 2 }-CO premixed flames (measured in the flat flame burner configuration) is found to be 3. 77 ({+-} 0. 38) cm/s. An externally perturbed H{sub 2 }-CO twin flame was not experimentally achievable for the mixture conditions used in the present investigation. A slightest perturbation in the flow-field distorts the H{sub 2 }-CO twin-flame. The flame becomes highly unstable with the introduction of an externally excited flow oscillation...|$|E
40|$|Premixed and partially-premixed {{combustion}} and ollutant {{emissions in}} full-scale gas turbines has been numerically investigated using a massively-parallel Large-Eddy Simulation Combustion Dynamics Model. Through {{the use of}} a flamelet library approach, it was observed that CO (Carbon Oxide) and NO (Nitric Oxide) emission can be predicted and match experimental results. The prediction of the CO emission trend is shown to be possible if the influence of the formation of UHC (Unburnt HydroCarbons) via <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> is taken into account. Simulations were repeated with two different combustion approach: the G-equation model and the Linear-Eddy Mixing (LEM) Model. Results are similar for these two sets of numerical simulations. The LEM model was used to simulate <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> and flame lift-off in a dump combustion chamber. The LEM model is compared to the G-equation model and {{it was found that the}} LEM model is more versatile than the G-equation model with regard to accurate simulation of flame propagation in all turbulent premixed combustion regimes. With the addition of heat losses, <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> was observed for low equivalence ratio. Numerical simulation of flame propagation with transient inflow conditions were also carried out and demonstrated the ability of the LEM model to accurately simulate flame propagation in the case of a partially-premixed system.

40|$|Non-premixed <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> {{phenomena}} {{are relevant}} {{in a variety}} of com- busting environments, including but hardly limited to diesel engines, pool fires, and fire suppression scenarios. These disparate phenomena are controlled by various parameters that contain information on flame stretch, heat losses, composition of the fuel and oxidizer supply streams, etc. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is {{used in the present study}} to provide fundamental insight on diffusion <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> under non-adiabatic combustion conditions. The list of DNS configurations include: (C 1) counterflow laminar flames with soot formation and thermal radiation transport; (C 2) coflow turbulent flames with soot formation and thermal radiation transport; (C 3) counterflow laminar and turbulent flames interacting with a mist-like water spray. Configurations C 1 and C 2 use single-step chemistry while configuration C 3 uses detailed chemistry (all cases correspond to ethylene-air combustion). Configuration C 1 is also treated using large Activation Energy Asymptotics (AEA). The AEA analysis is based on a classical formulation that is extended to include thermal radiation transport with both emission and absorption effects; the analysis also includes soot dynamics. The AEA analysis provides a <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> criterion in the form of a critical Damköhler number criterion. The DNS results are used to test the validity of this <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> criterion. In configuration C 1, the <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> occurs as a result of flame stretch or radiative cooling; a variation of configuration C 1 is considered in which the oxidizer stream contains a variable amount of soot mass. In configuration C 1, flame weakening occurs as a result of radiative cooling; this effect is magnified by artificially increasing the mean Planck soot absorption coefficient. In configuration C 3, <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> occurs as a result of flame stretch and evaporative cooling. In all studied cases, the critical Damkohler number criterion successfully predicts transition to extinction; this result supports the unifying concept of a flame Damköhler number Da and the idea that different extinction phenomena may be described by a single critical value of Da...|$|E

40|$|The {{implosion}} {{technique has}} been used to extend measurements of turbulent burning velocities over greater ranges of fuels and pressures. Measurements have been made up to 3. 5 MPa and at strain rate Markstein numbers as low as − 23. The implosion technique, with spark ignition at two opposite wall positions within a fan-stirred spherical bomb is capable of measuring turbulent burning velocities, at higher pressures than is possible with central ignition. Pressure records and schlieren high speed photography define the rate of burning and the smoothed area of the flame front.

The second aim was to study further the low turbulence regime in which turbulent burning co-exists with laminar flame instabilities. Correlations are presented of turbulent burning velocity normalised by the effective rms turbulent velocity acting on the flame front, ut/uk′, with the Karlovitz stretch factor, K, for different strain rate Markstein numbers, a decrease in which increases ut/uk′. Experimental correlations are presented for the present measurements, combined with previous ones.

40|$|The {{extinction}} {{and structure}} of non-premixed methane/air flames were investigated in normal gravity and microgravity through the comparison of experiments and calculations using a counterflow configuration. From a fire safety perspective, low strain rate conditions are important for several reasons. In normal gravity, many fires start from small ignition sources where the convective flow and strain rates are weak. Fires in microgravity conditions, such as a manned spacecraft, may also occur in near quiescent conditions where strain rates are very low. When designing a fire suppression system, worst-case conditions should be considered. Most diffusion flames become more robust as the strain rate is decreased. The goal of this project is to investigate the extinction limits of non-premixed flames using various agents and to compare reduced gravity and normal gravity conditions. Experiments at the NASA Glenn Research Center's 2. 2 -second drop tower were conducted to attain extinction and temperature measurements in low-strain non-premixed <b>flames.</b> <b>Extinction</b> measurements using nitrogen added to the fuel stream were performed for global strain rates from 7 /s to 50 /s. The results confirmed the "turning point" behavior observed previously by Maruta et al. in a 10 s drop tower.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to clarify flame characteristics through the evaluation of critical mole fractions at <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> and edge-flame oscillation of low strain rate flames using the global strain rate, velocity ratio, and burner distance as experimental variables. The transition from a shrinking flame disk to a flame hole was verified through gradient measurements of the maximum flame temperature. Evidence of edge-flame oscillation in flame disks was also found using numerical simulations in zero and normal gravity. The main mechanisms of <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> and edge-flame oscillation were analyzed by comparing the energy fractions in the energy equation. For low strain rate flame disks, radial conduction heat loss rather than flame radiation was a significant contributor to <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> and even edge-flame oscillation. This was experimentally demonstrated by evaluating the critical mole fraction at <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> and edge-flame oscillation, as well as measurements of the flame temperature gradient along the flame disk surface. These results suggest that low strain rate flame responses are determined not only by one-dimensional flame responses, but also by multi-dimensional flame responses such as radial conduction heat loss. The results also show that extinction of low strain rate flames is more probably due to multi-dimensional heat losses than to radiative extinction...|$|E

The work has two main objectives: identify {{the influence of the}} Reynolds number on the oxy-syngas flame structure, and to clarify the local <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> of oxy-syngas and syngas-air flames at a higher Reynolds number. Two oxy-syngas flames at Reynolds numbers 3000 and 6000 and one syngas-air flame at Reynolds number 6000 were simulated. The scattered data, probability density function distributions and fully burning probability provide the local flame characteristics of oxy-syngas and syngas-air nonpremixed jet flames. It is found that the H 2 /CO oxy-syngas flame burns well compared to the syngas-air flame and the high Reynolds number causes more flow straining, resulting in higher scalar dissipation rates which lead to lower temperatures and eventually local <b>flame</b> <b>extinction.</b> The oxy-syngas flames burns more vigorously than the syngas-air flame with the same adiabatic flame temperature of approximately 2400 K.

The foregoing gases were selected because they are the primary constitutes of natural gas, which is the primary focus of the present study. To validate the experimental setup and methodology, the <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> limit of pure fuels at zero stretch conditions were also estimated and compared with published values. The lean <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> limits of methane (f{sub ext} = 4. 6 %) and propane (f{sub ext} = 2. 25 %) flames measured in the present study agreed with the values reported in the literature. It was observed that the <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> limit of fuel blends have a polynomial relation with the concentration of component fuels in the mixture. This behavior contradicts with the commonly used linear Le Chatelier's approximation. The experimentally determined polynomial relations between the <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> limits of fuel blends (i. e. methane-propane and methane-ethane) and methane concentration are as follows: (1) Methane-Propane [...] %f{sub ext} = (1. 05 x 10 {sup - 9 }) f{sup 5 }-(1. 3644 x 10 {sup - 7 }) f{sup 4 }+(6. 40299 x 10 {sup - 6 }) f{sup 3 }-(1. 2108459 x 10 {sup - 4 }) f{sup 2 }+(2. 87305329 x 10 {sup - 3 }) f+ 2. 2483; (2) Methane-Ethane [...] %f{sub ext} = (2. 1 x 10 {sup - 9 }) f{sup 5 }-(3. 5752 x 10 {sup - 7 }) f{sup 4 }+(2. 095425 x 10 {sup - 5 }) f{sup 3 }-(5. 037353 x 10 {sup - 4 }) f{sup 2 } + 6. 08980409 f + 2. 8923. Where f{sub ext} is the extinction limits of methane-propane and methane-ethane fuel blends, and f is the concentration (% volume) of methane in the fuel mixture. The relations were obtained by fitting fifth order curve (polynomial regression) to experimentally measured extinction limits at different mixture conditions. To extend the study to a commercial fuel, the <b>flame</b> <b>extinction</b> limit for Birmingham natural gas (a blend of 95 % methane, 5 % ethane and 5 % nitrogen) was experimentally determined and was found to be 3. 62 % fuel in the air-fuel mixture...|$|E
40|$|WOS: 000401385300030 International audienceA low global {{richness}} of combustion is interesting from an ecological and economic {{point of view}} as it helps to limit fuel consumption. In fact, {{the consequences of the}} combustion in poor mode are the appearance of local or global <b>flame</b> <b>extinctions,</b> energy loss by radiation and change in flame structure. The flammability limits of the diffusion methane flame can be resolved by the enrichment of the combustion air with oxygen or the use of the pure oxygen as oxidant as well as the addition to hydrogen in natural gas. Moreover, the use of oxygen and hydrogen as previously mentioned allow working in low ranges of richness while maintaining good flame stability. For a constant burner power of 15 kW, the reduction of the richness involves an increase in the oxidizer flow rate injected into the combustion reaction. In this present study, the variation of the richness, the fuel enrichment with hydrogen and the oxidant enrichment with oxygen are shown as major parameters where they have direct influences on the flow dynamic, the flame structure and the pollutant emissions. The Chemiluminescence of OH* radical and the PIV (Particle image velocimetry) are used in this work to characterize the flame structure, the stability and the dynamics of the flame. The measurement of pollutant emissions effected by a gas analyzer. The enrichment in oxygen and hydrogen provides a stable flame, which is well attached to the burner for the following richness values: 0. 7, 0. 8, 0. 9 and 1. The reduction of the richness promotes the mixture quality of the reactants and leads a reduction in CO 2 and CO concentration. By contrast, the decrease of the richness supports the formation of NOx. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Closed-loop {{active control}} methods and their {{application}} to combustion instabilities are discussed. In these methods the instability development is impeded with a feedback control loop : the signal {{provided by a}} sensor monitoring the flame or pressure oscillations is processed and sent back to actuators mounted on the combustor or on the feeding system. Different active control systems tested on a non-premixed multiple-flame turbulent combustor are described. These systems can suppress all unstable plane modes of oscillation (i. e. low frequency modes). The active instability control (AIC) also constitutes an original and powerful technique for studies of mechanisms leading to instability or resulting from the instability. Two basic applications of this kind are described. In the first case the flame is initially controlled with AIC, the feedback loop is then switched off {{and the growth of}} the instability is analysed through high speed Schlieren cinematography and simultaneous sound pressure and reaction rate measurements. Three phases are identified during th growth of the oscillations : (1) a linear phase where acoustic waves induce a flapping motion of the flame sheets without interaction between sheets, (2) a modulation phase, where flame sheets interact randomly and (3) a nonlinear phase where the flame sheets are broken and a limit cycle is reached. In the second case we investigate different types of <b>flame</b> <b>extinctions</b> associated with combustion instability. It is shown that pressure oscillations may lead to partial or total extinctions. Extinctions occur in various forms but usually follow a rapid growth of pressure oscillations. The flame is extinguished during the modulation phase observed in the initiation experiments. In these studies devoted to transient instability phenomena, the control system constitutes a unique investigation tool because it is difficult to obtain the same information by other means. Implications for modelling and prediction of combustion instabilities are discussed...|$|R

A large variety of stationary spatially localized states representing {{the breakup of}} the <b>flame</b> front near <b>extinction</b> is computed using numerical continuation. These states are organized by a global bifurcation in space that takes place at a particular value of the Damköhler number and their existence is consistent with current understanding of spatial localization in driven dissipative systems...|$|R
