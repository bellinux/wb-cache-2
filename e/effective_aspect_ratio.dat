There are several types of wing tip devices, and although they function in different manners, their intended effect is always to reduce the aircraft's drag by partial recovery of the tip vortex energy.

Such devices increase the <b>effective</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of a wing without materially increasing the wingspan. An extension of span would lower lift-induced drag, but would increase parasitic drag and would require boosting the strength and weight of the wing.

50|$|Variable-geometry turbochargers (VGTs), (also {{known as}} {{variable}} nozzle turbines/VNTs), are {{a family of}} turbochargers, usually designed to allow the <b>effective</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> (A:R) of the turbo to be altered as conditions change. This is done because optimum aspect ratio at low engine speeds {{is very different from}} that at high engine speeds. If the aspect ratio is too large, the turbo will fail to create boost at low speeds; if the aspect ratio is too small, the turbo will choke the engine at high speeds, leading to high exhaust manifold pressures, high pumping losses, and ultimately lower power output. By altering the geometry of the turbine housing as the engine accelerates, the turbo's aspect ratio can be maintained at its optimum. Because of this, VGTs have a minimal amount of lag, have a low boost threshold, and are very efficient at higher engine speeds. VGTs do not require a wastegate.|$|E

5000|$|The lift from a wing is {{generated}} by the airflow over it from front to rear. With increasing span-wise flow the boundary layers {{on the surface of}} the wing have longer to travel, and so are thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation, also the <b>effective</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of the wing is less and so air [...] "leaks" [...] around the wing tips reducing their effectiveness. The spanwise flow on swept wings produces airflow that moves the stagnation point on the leading edge of any individual wing segment further beneath the leading edge, increasing effective angle of attack of wing segments relative to its neighbouring forward segment. The result is that wing segments farther towards the rear operate at increasingly higher angles of attack promoting early stall of those segments. This promotes tip stall on back swept wings, as the tips are most rearward, while delaying tip stall for forward swept wings, where the tips are forward. With both forward and back swept wings, the rear of the wing will stall first. This creates a nose-up pressure on the aircraft. If this is not corrected by the pilot it causes the plane to pitch up, leading to more of the wing stalling, leading to more pitch up, and so on. This problem came to be known as the Sabre dance in reference to the number of North American F-100 Super Sabres that crashed on landing as a result.|$|E

It is important in generation, maturation migration, and accumulation of hydrocarbon, but the effects of overpressure on rock frame have not been investigated. In this study, experiments were carried out to study the effects of overpressure on rock frame structures using five core samples from the Junggar basin, Northwest China. The deformations and velocities for the samples were measured at different effective pressures related to non-equilibrium compaction and fluid expansion overpressure mechanisms. The results show that the effect of overpressure on rock frames gradually increases when the effective pressure drops down to a certain value (called critical pressure). Moreover, non-equilibrium compaction mechanism has more effects on rock frames than fluid expansion mechanism under the same effective pressure. Furthermore to study rock frame structural changes, we use Kuster and Toksoz's expressions to simulate the <b>effective</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> of inclusions alpha (penny shapes) for different effective pressures. The results show that the alpha decreases dramatically when the effective pressure decreases from the critical pressure. Changes of alpha can be interpreted as responses to the rock frame changes when grains conform one another by rotating and self-adjusting. However, different mechanisms of overpressure have different effects on rock frames. The rock frame can be affected. more easily by overpressure in shallow regions generated by non-equilibrium compaction mechanism. Once this kind of rock frames are preserved after overpressure releases to a normal hydrostatic pressure, they can be identified by their specific rock frame characters.

40|$|In {{this article}} by {{the method of}} {{equations}} of steady horizontal flight the impact of AT winglets wingtips on the inductive reactance of the wing is explored. The total aerodynamic force, created by all four parts of the wingtips is determined. The vector of the total aerodynamic force of the wingtips is represented {{in the form of}} components of a linked coordinate system. Equilibrium equations for the steady motion of an aircraft with AT winglets wingtips in a horizontal flight are recorded. From these equations it is obtained that, in the direction of motion, the longitudinal component of the vector of the total aerodynamic force of the tips reduces the inductive drag of the wing, the vertical component is added to the lifting force of the wing, and the lateral component, due to symmetry, is zero. It is shown that the lifting force created by the AT winglets wingtips is larger compared to the same ones created by the upper tips. An important consequence is that the distribution of the lifting force over the wing span with double tips is more even in comparison with the wing without a tip or with a wing with the upper wingtip. The expression for the <b>effective</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of the wing with the tips is determined, which is greater than the inductive drag of the wing without the tip.

40|$|Early {{theories}} for bottlebrush polymers {{have suggested}} that the so-called main-chain stiffening effect caused by the presence of a dense corona of side chains along a central main chain should lead to an increased ratio of effective persistence length (lp,eff) over the effective thickness (Deff) and, hence, ultimately to lyotropic liquid crystalline behavior. More recent theories and simulations suggest that lp,eff ~ Deff, such that no liquid crystalline behavior is induced by bottlebrushes. In this paper we investigate experimentally how lyotropic liquid crystalline behavior of a semiflexible polymer is affected by a dense coating of side chains. We use semiflexible DNA as the main chain. A genetically engineered diblock protein polymer C 4 K 12 is used to physically adsorb long side chains on the DNA. The C 4 K 12 protein polymer consists of a positively charged binding block (12 lysines, K 12) and a hydrophilic random coil block of 400 amino acids (C 4). From light scattering we find that, at low ionic strength (10 mM Tris-HCl), the thickness of the self-assembled DNA bottlebrushes is on the order of 30 nm and the effective grafting density is 1 side chain per 2. 7 nm of DNA main chain. We find these self-assembled DNA bottlebrushes form birefringent lyotropic liquid crystalline phases at DNA concentrations as low as 8 mg/mL, roughly 1 order of magnitude lower than for bare DNA. Using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) we show that, at DNA concentrations of 12 mg/mL, there is a transition to a hexagonal phase. We also show that, while the effective persistence length increases due to the bottlebrush coating, the effective thickness of the bottlebrush increases even more, such that in our case the bottlebrush coating reduces the <b>effective</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of the DNA. This is in agreement with theoretical estimates that show that, in most cases of practical interest, a bottlebrush coating will lead to a decrease of the <b>effective</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> whereas, only for bottlebrushes with extremely long side chains at very high grafting densities, a bottlebrush coating may be expected to lead to an increase of the <b>effective</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|E
