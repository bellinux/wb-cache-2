5|$|At {{the time}} of the tornado, roughly 1,000 people lived in the hamlet of Chappaqua. Five homes and three barns were {{destroyed}} by the tornado and two people, 80-year-old Mrs. Mary Hibbs and an unknown woman, were killed; six additional people were injured. Orchards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tornado were completely destroyed and greenhouses were leveled. The severity of lightning during the storm caused many women to faint according to The New York Times.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1989, OTA {{approved}} {{a contract to}} transplant approximately 290 live trees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turnpike to locations {{along the edge of}} the right-of-way. There, the trees would serve as a barrier between the road and the surrounding properties, masking the road from view and muffling the sounds of traffic. A Norman landscaping firm performed the work, which included thirty months of maintenance, for a total cost of $288.50 per tree ($544.19 in 2013 dollars).|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the walls}} {{a series of}} semicircular defense lines were {{constructed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese advance, most notably an outer one about sixteen kilometers (10 miles) {{from the city and}} an inner one directly outside the city known as the Fukuo Line, or multiple positions line. The Fukuo Line, a sprawling network of trenches, moats, barbed wire, mine fields, gun emplacements, and pillboxes, was to be the final defense line outside Nanking's city walls. There were also two key high points of land on the Fukuo Line, the peaks of Zijinshan to the northeast and the plateau of Yuhuatai to the south, where fortification was especially dense. In order to deny the Japanese invaders any shelter or supplies in this area, Tang adopted a strategy of scorched earth on December 7, ordering all homes and structures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese within one to two kilometers (1.2 miles) of the city to be incinerated, as well as all homes and structures near roadways within sixteen kilometers (10 miles) of the city.|$|E

5|$|Public {{schools in}} some {{counties}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hurricane {{were scheduled to}} be closed for two weeks. In some areas this was necessary because the school buildings were damaged or destroyed: all 59of Osceola County's schools were damaged, and one-third of Charlotte County's were destroyed by Charley's impact. DeSoto County schools saw $6million in damage, while Orange County Public Schools saw $9million in damage to their educational infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) {{failed to}} issue {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches 24hours in advance. Despite {{the lack of}} early warning, only six deaths ensued. Damage was greatest on Kauai, where the hurricane destroyed more than 1,400 houses and severely damaged more than 5,000. Though not directly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye, Oahu experienced moderate damage from wind and storm surge.|$|E
5|$|The German {{breakthrough}} at Sedan, {{which had}} been thought impassable, meant that defenders of the K-W Line risked being outflanked, and had to withdraw on 16 May. The German invasion triggered a panic amongst Belgian civilians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advancing German army. By 11 May, the roads leading westwards, away from the fighting, were blocked by refugees, hampering the eastward advance of French and British forces. It is estimated that around two million civilians fled their homes during the campaign.|$|E

5|$|By 11 January, the Apache Corporation began {{evacuating}} all non-essential {{personnel from}} oil rigs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm. The Rio Tinto Group shut down iron exports at its Dampier and Cape Lambert ports due to rough seas. Across the Pilbara region, the State Emergency Service advised residents to secure loose objects and ensure their emergency kits were stocked. Incident management teams were also established {{to help people}} {{in the wake of the}} storm. Additionally, urban search and rescue equipment was set up in Karratha. Horizon Power dispatched additional linemen to the most at-risk areas in Narelle's path to speed up power restoration in the wake of the storm. In Carnarvon, mango producers picked as much of their fruit as possible before the storm arrived to minimise losses.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia Station was {{complicated}} by {{the discovery of a}} potential toxic waste site <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subway. In June 1991, WMATA discovered that the District of Columbia had dumped 426,000 tons of possibly hazardous incinerator bottom ash in an unused exposed culvert along the subway's potential path near St. Elizabeth's Hospital between 1977 and 1989. The city continued to dump the ash at the site for four years after it learned that WMATA planned to use the site for the Green Line. Experts were concerned that the ash dump contained pockets of methane gas and soluble acid, which would make the site unusable by Metrorail.|$|E

5|$|Gellibrand {{was sent}} to the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom as Brigadier General, General Staff (BGGS) to Major General James Whiteside McCay. McCay was known as a hard task master, but he had nothing but praise for the work of Gellibrand, who helped him {{overhaul}} the organisation and the training syllabus. Likewise, Gellibrand held McCay in high regard. Gellibrand returned to the Western Front on 14 November 1917, taking over command of the 12th Infantry Brigade vice Brigadier General James Campbell Robertson, who was returning to Australia on leave. He soon placed his own distinctive stamp on his new command. In April 1918, the brigade was committed to battle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advancing German Army in the Battle of Dernancourt. The brigade held and defeated the German advance.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{at the age}} of thirteen, he {{was allowed}} to enter the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who {{monitored}} Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him. Shostakovich studied piano with Leonid Nikolayev after a year in the class of Elena Rozanova, composition with Maximilian Steinberg, and counterpoint and fugue with Nikolay Sokolov, with whom he became friends. Shostakovich also attended Alexander Ossovsky's history of music classes. Steinberg tried to guide Shostakovich <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great Russian composers, but was disappointed to see him 'wasting' his talent and imitating Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Shostakovich also suffered for his perceived lack of political zeal, and initially failed his exam in Marxist methodology in 1926. His first major musical achievement was the First Symphony (premiered 1926), written as his graduation piece {{at the age of}} nineteen.|$|E
5|$|SR 149 was {{relocated}} onto a new two-lane alignment in the mid-1970s, {{leaving behind}} Openshaw Road. Caltrans began studies for interchanges {{at each end}} in September 1992. The California Transportation Commission approved funding for four-laning SR 149 in April 1994 and the two interchanges in May 1996, with construction to begin in 1998 and cost $47 million. Due to state budget problems {{and the need to}} study environmental impacts, the project was repeatedly pushed back; these impacts and inflation had more than doubled the cost to $120 million in 2004. In particular, an endangered species of meadowfoam was discovered on the south embankent, forcing a redesign. Construction began in September 2005 on a new freshwater marsh near the State Route 70 intersection to replace beaver ponds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway, and it was completed in March 2006.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Mons {{took place}} {{as part of}} the Battle of the Frontiers, in which the {{advancing}} German armies clashed with the advancing Allied armies along the Franco-Belgian and Franco-German borders. The British position on the French flank meant that it stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German 1st Army. The British reached Mons on 22 August and at the time, the French Fifth Army, located on the right of the British, was heavily engaged with the German 2nd and 3rd armies at the Battle of Charleroi. The British agreed to hold the line of the Condé–Mons–Charleroi Canal for twenty-four hours, to prevent the advancing German 1st Army from threatening the French left flank. The British thus spent the day digging in along the canal.|$|E
5|$|The Eisenhower–Johnson Memorial Tunnel {{was known}} as the Straight Creek Tunnel during construction, named for the {{waterway}} that runs along the western approach to the tunnel. Before the tunnel was dedicated, it was renamed to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower and Edwin C. Johnson. Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968. Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget. One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnel that were not discovered during the pilot bores. These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses. Despite the best efforts of engineers, three workers were killed boring the first tube, and four in boring the second.|$|E
5|$|The Weather Bureau in San Juan, Puerto Rico {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} warning for Trinidad, Tobago, and the Grenadines south of Saint Vincent in the cyclone's first advisory on Hurricane Flora. Gale warnings were later issued for islands off northern Venezuela and from Saint Vincent northward to Martinique. Advisories on Flora emphasized {{the danger of}} the hurricane and advised preparations to be rushed to completion. The advisories also recommended small craft throughout the Windward Islands to remain at harbor and for shipping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hurricane to advise extreme caution. People in low-lying areas and near beaches were advised to evacuate to higher grounds, as well. Lead time was short, especially in Tobago which received news of the approaching hurricane just two hours before it struck.|$|E

5|$|The {{track of}} Hurricane Bob by August19 {{was similar to}} that of Hurricane Carol in 1954, another major {{hurricane}} that impacted New England. Significantly cooler sea surface temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hurricane resulted in weakening, leading to the eye becoming cloud-filled. Later on August19, the western portion of the eyewall brushed the eastern tip of Long Island. Around 1800UTC, the center of Bob made landfall near Newport, Rhode Island with winds of 100mph (155km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane. The storm quickly weakened as it tracked through Rhode Island and Massachusetts before entering the Gulf of Maine. Around 0130UTC on August20, the now weakened Tropical Storm Bob made another landfall near Rockport, Maine with winds of 70mph (110km/h).|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Linda caused {{considerable}} {{deaths in}} Vietnam. Many fishermen and sailors were caught at sea <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm, unable to escape its path. Within three days, {{the death toll}} in Vietnam was set at over 150, with thousands missing, many of them fishermen. By the fourth day after the storm, the toll reached 390, and on November 14, eight days after the storm, the death toll reached 464. Ultimately, the death toll was set at 3,111. Eight days after Linda's passage, a United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) report indicated 857people were injured by the storm. The government quickly established search and rescue teams, particularly for missing fishermen, {{and a total of}} 3,513 people were rescued after the storm. In the weeks after the storm, hundreds of dead bodies washed ashore in Vietnam and Thailand.|$|E
5|$|As Felice {{neared the}} coast, gale {{warnings}} were hoisted from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Galveston, while a hurricane watch extended from Morgan City to Port O'Connor, Texas. Small craft advisories were also posted, cautioning light vessels {{to remain in}} port. All coastal advisories were discontinued by {{the early hours of}} September 16. Residents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm generally evacuated in a timely manner. Over 3,000 fled the storm in Cameron Parish, Louisiana; around half of the residents in the low-lying southern part of the parish had already left before the mandatory evacuation was ordered. Farther west, one of two evacuation routes out of Sabine Pass, Texas had been rendered unusable {{a few days before the}} storm when a bridge was damaged in a maritime accident. As the remaining highway was considered susceptible to coastal flooding, officials quickly worked to evacuate 1,300 people in Sabine Pass before the storm's approach. The American Red Cross converted nine public schools into temporary storm shelters in and around Beaumont. Shelters were also set up in Houston and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, though they went mostly unused. The post offices in Sabine Pass, Gilchrist, and Port Bolivar transferred money orders, first-class parcels and postage stamps to the Beaumont office as a safety precaution.|$|E
