The {{purpose of}} these experiments is to continue {{the investigation into the}} dynamics of impurity transport. A unique diagnostic capability is currently available {{through the use of a}} modified HIREX Sr. spectrometer capable of viewing a time evolving calcium charge state density profile. The combination of HIREX Sr., multiple single chord spectrometers, and the laser <b>blow</b> <b>off</b> <b>system</b> represents an opportunity to perform L, I, and H-Mode impurity transport studies with greater accuracy than those previously performed. Ultimately the purpose of these experiments is to allow for the recharacterization of the impurity flux as a function of local or dimensionless parameters for comparison with impurity transport theories and gyrokinetic simulations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A novel {{method for}} {{introducing}} a back-up system to an active compressor surge control system {{is presented in}} this paper. Active surge control is a promising method for extending the compressor map towards and into the unstable area at low mass flow by stabilizing the surge phenomenon. The method also has potential for allowing operation at higher efficiencies. However, a failure in the active surge control system may endanger the compressor by entering deep surge as the compressor is allowed {{to operate in the}} stabilized surge area. We propose the use of a back-up system applied to the active system to keep the compressor safe should the active system fail. This paper present an active compressor surge control system with piston actuation combined with a <b>blow</b> <b>off</b> <b>system</b> as the back-up. Performance of the combined system is evaluated by simulating the system in situations where the piston is saturated or jammed. The combination results in a system with increased performance by taking advantage of both systems...|$|R
