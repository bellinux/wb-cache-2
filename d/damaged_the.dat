5|$|The First World War badly <b>damaged</b> <b>the</b> {{remaining}} duck {{industry in}} Buckinghamshire, wiping out the small scale producers and {{leaving only a}} few large farms. Disruption caused by the Second World War further <b>damaged</b> <b>the</b> industry. By the 1950s only one significant flock of Aylesbury ducks remained in Buckinghamshire, and by 1966 there were no duck-breeding or -rearing businesses of any size remaining in Aylesbury itself. Although {{there is only one}} surviving flock of pure Aylesbury ducks in the United Kingdom and the breed is critically endangered in the United States, the Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury, and appears on the coat of arms of Aylesbury and on the club badge of Aylesbury United.|$|E

The experimental work considers <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> detection by measured data only without the baseline data of intact structure. It is shown that the strain sensor cannot indicate <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> if <b>the</b> sensor doesn’t locate at <b>the</b> <b>damage.</b> But <b>the</b> deflection sensor provides the information on <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> from <b>the</b> deflected curve by collected data. The results are illustrated in experimental work...|$|R
