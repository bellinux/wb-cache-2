5|$|Himmler was {{interested}} in mysticism and the occult from an early age. He tied this interest into his racist philosophy, looking <b>for</b> <b>proof</b> of Aryan and Nordic racial superiority from ancient times. He promoted a cult of ancestor worship, particularly {{among members of the}} SS, as a way to keep the race pure and provide immortality to the nation.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009, after {{dozens of}} people {{reported}} seeing a mermaid leaping out of Haifa Bay waters and doing aerial tricks, the Israeli coastal town of Kiryat Yam offered a $1 million award <b>for</b> <b>proof</b> of its existence. In February 2012, work on two reservoirs near Gokwe and Mutare in Zimbabwe stopped when workers refused to continue, stating that mermaids had hounded {{them away from the}} sites. It was reported by Samuel Sipepa Nkomo, the water resources minister.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder goes to the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico to continue his search <b>for</b> <b>proof</b> on extraterrestrial life. Meanwhile, Scully attempts to aid him after being separated following {{the closure of the}} X-Files.|$|E

5|$|This case {{became a}} model for, and was {{referenced}} in, the Salem Witch Trials in Massachusetts, when the magistrates were looking <b>for</b> <b>proof</b> that spectral evidence {{could be used}} in a court of law. Reverend John Hale, whose wife was accused at Salem, in his publication, Modest Inquiry into the Nature of Witchcraft, noted how the judges consulted for precedents and lists the 60-page publication A Tryal of Witches.|$|E
5|$|Minton did {{not realize}} that Frank was also {{president}} of the University of Wisconsin, and soon suffered retaliation for the way he had treated Frank. Frank went on NBC radio stations around the country and lambasted Minton for his rudeness. He made lengthy arguments accusing Minton of attempting to violate the Bill of Rights. Minton was outraged, but the arguments had an effect among voters in Indiana. In 1938, he sought funding to launch a massive nationwide investigation of media conglomerates <b>for</b> <b>proof</b> of Republican interference in the press. Democratic Senator Edward R. Burke led an effort to defeat the measure and privately accused Minton of damaging the Democrats' cause, which led Minton to leave the Lobby Investigation Committee.|$|E
5|$|Writing {{after the}} fall of Nojpetén, friar Cano {{described}} the ultimate fate of Díaz de Velasco and his companions; he claimed to have received the information from interviews with the soldiers from Yucatán who had stormed the Itza capital and from Ch'ol witnesses, although there were no Ch'ol at Nojpetén. Díaz's party arrived at the lakeshore and were told by local Itza that Franciscan friars were at Nojpetén. They were wary at first and asked <b>for</b> <b>proof,</b> upon which an Itza messenger brought them a rosary as a token. Looking across the lake they saw men dressed as friars calling to them to come across, these were Itza dressed in the habits of the two Franciscans who had recently been killed at the island. Díaz and his companions then boarded the Itza canoes, leaving thirty Maya porters with their mules and supplies.|$|E

25|$|By this time, {{gossip about}} Caroline was everywhere. Lord Byron {{wrote to his}} {{publisher}} that Caroline and Pergami were lovers, and Baron Friedrich Ompteda, a Hanoverian spy, bribed one of Caroline's servants {{so that he could}} search her bedroom <b>for</b> <b>proof</b> of adultery. He found none. By August 1817, Caroline's debts were growing, so she sold Villa d'Este and moved to the smaller Villa Caprile near Pesaro. Pergami's mother, brother and daughter, but not his wife, joined Caroline's household.|$|E
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>proof</b> procedures, a {{definition}} of completeness has been given: a proof procedure is strongly complete if it allows finding a closed tableau for any given unsatisfiable set of formulae. Proof confluence of the underlying calculus is relevant to completeness: proof confluence is the guarantee that a closed tableau can be always generated from an arbitrary partially constructed tableau (if the set is unsatisfiable). Without proof confluence, {{the application of a}} 'wrong' rule may result in the impossibility of making the tableau complete by applying other rules.|$|E

25|$|Domestic {{violence}} in Argentina against women {{is a serious}} problem. Rape, including spousal rape, is a crime, but the need <b>for</b> <b>proof,</b> either {{in the form of}} clear physical injury or the testimony of a witness, often presented difficulties in prosecuting such crimes. In August 2008 Amnesty International reported that a woman died every two days as a result of domestic violence. According to press reports quoting the Buenos Aires Provincial Ministry of Security statistics, 52,351 complaints of domestic abuse were filed at the Women's Police Stations in Buenos Aires Province in the first 10 months of the year.|$|E
25|$|Again, to the Salon d'Automne of 1913 - a salon {{in which}} Cubism {{was now the}} predominating {{tendency}} - Metzinger sent the great picture called En Bâteau (En Canot, Im Boot), La Fresnaye La Conquête de l'Air, myself Les Bâteaux de Pêche and La Ville et le Fleuve. If the first moment of surprise had passed by, the interest Cubism excited was as great as ever. The anger and the enthusiasm had not changed sides, our enemies held to their guns. It is enough <b>for</b> <b>proof</b> to read the diatribes of Louis Vauxcelles in Gil Blas for that year,1913, and the panegyrics of Guillaume Apollinaire in L'Intransigeant.|$|E
25|$|The James Randi Educational Foundation {{offers a}} prize {{of a million}} dollars to a person who can prove that they have supernatural or paranormal {{abilities}} under appropriate test conditions.

The IIG offers a $100,000 prize and a $5,000 finders fee if a claimant can prove a paranormal claim under 2 scientifically controlled tests. Founded in 2000 no claimant has passed the first (and lower odds) of the test.|$|E

25|$|Velikovsky's revised {{chronology}} {{has been}} rejected by nearly all mainstream historians and Egyptologists. It was claimed, starting with early reviewers, that Velikovsky's usage of material <b>for</b> <b>proof</b> is often very selective. In 1965 the leading cuneiformist Abraham Sachs, in a forum at Brown University, discredited Velikovsky's use of Mesopotamian cuneiform sources. Velikovsky {{was never able to}} refute Sachs' attack. In 1978, following the much-postponed publication of further volumes in Velikovsky's Ages in Chaos series, the United Kingdom-based Society for Interdisciplinary Studies organised a conference in Glasgow specifically to debate the revised chronology. The ultimate conclusion of this work, by scholars including Peter James, John Bimson, Geoffrey Gammonn, and David Rohl, was that the Revised Chronology was untenable. The SIS has continued to publish updates of this ongoing discussion, in particular the work of historian Emmet Sweeney.|$|E
25|$|After {{appearing}} in the TV series Neighbours and Living with the Law, Crowe was cast by Faith Martin in his first film, The Crossing (1990), a small-town love triangle directed by George Ogilvie. Before production started, a film-student protégé of Ogilvie, Steve Wallace, hired Crowe for the film Blood Oath (1990) (aka Prisoners of the Sun), which was released a month earlier than The Crossing, although actually filmed later. In 1992, Crowe starred in the first episode of the second series of Police Rescue. Also in 1992, Crowe starred in Romper Stomper, an Australian film which followed the exploits and downfall of a racist skinhead group in blue-collar suburban Melbourne, directed by Geoffrey Wright. For the role, Crowe won an Australian Film Institute (AFI) award for Best Actor, following up from his Best Supporting Actor award <b>for</b> <b>Proof</b> in 1991.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{requirement}} that either party must change their surname upon entering a civil partnership. However, many couples wish to follow marital traditions {{and seek to}} change their surname to that of either partner, or combine their names to make a double-barrelled surname. This change can be made after the civil partnership is registered, and authorities will accept a certificate of civil partnership as evidence of name change, e.g. when applying for a passport or a driving licence. In Scotland, names need not be changed to be considered valid (deeds poll do not exist under Scots law), though some English-based companies may still ask <b>for</b> <b>proof</b> from an official such as a Justice of the Peace. Civil partners of male peers or knights do not receive a courtesy title to which the spouse of a peer or knight would be entitled.|$|E
