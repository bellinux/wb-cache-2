The latter accepted Thiagarajan's offer and approved of his decision to cast his son, Prashanth, in the <b>dual</b> <b>lead</b> roles. In July2008, the project was officially announced in a press meet. The film subsequently began pre-production, with Thyagarajan opting to produce the film under his Sri Lakshmi Shanthi Films banner. The preliminary stages of the production took more than a year, with story-boarding, costume designs and colossal set designs all being finalized. Prashanth revealed that extensive research about the time period alone took a year and a half.|$|E

An energetic set of demos (eight of which were briefly and illegally released on Pickwick Records in 1980 under the title Introducing the Doobie Brothers, and have since been bootlegged on CD under that title and On Our Way Up as well, both with expanded song selections), showcased fuzz-toned <b>dual</b> <b>lead</b> electric guitars, three-part harmonies and Hartman's frenetic drumming and earned the rock group a contract at Warner Bros.

25|$|Apart {{from the}} casting of Ajith Kumar in the <b>dual</b> <b>lead</b> role, {{previously}} played by Rajinikanth, {{the rest of}} the cast took nearly four months to finalise. The role played by Sripriya in the original, was given to Nayantara in early 2007, controversially after Bollywood actress, Isha Sherwani, who had been in contention to act in the last few movies of Ajith Kumar, was paid the advance. Vishnuvardhan reported that he was pleased with Nayanthara's role in, E and subsequently opted for her. The other lead female role in the film was initially written for Shriya Saran, but due to her contract with , she refused to accept the film. Despite other actresses such as Trisha Krishnan, Reema Sen, Asin Thottumkal and Bhanu being considered, the role was eventually given to Pooja Umashankar. However, she refused the role, citing that she was reluctant to appear in a bikini, as the role required. Subsequently, Namitha, another actress was signed up for the role.|$|E

40|$|Objective: In {{spinal cord}} stimulation, neurosurgeons {{increasingly}} tend to implant <b>dual</b> <b>leads.</b> <b>Dual</b> <b>leads</b> (longitudinal bipole/tripole) provide medio-lateral {{control over the}} recruited dorsal column (DC) area by steering the injected cathodal currents. However, the DC recruited area is suboptimal when <b>dual</b> aligned <b>leads</b> straddling the midline programmed as longitudinal guarded cathodes (+-+) are used instead of a single lead placed over the spinal cord midline with the same configuration. As a potential improvement, an additional third lead between the two aligned leads is modeled to maximize the medio-lateral extent of the DCs at the low-thoracic vertebral region (T 10 -T 12). Methods and Materials: The University of Twente Spinal Cord Stimulation software (UT-SCS) is used in this modeling study. Longitudinal guarded cathodes were modeled on the low-thoracic vertebral region (T 10 -T 12) using percutaneous triple lead configurations. The central lead was modeled over the spinal cord midline and the two lateral leads were modeled at several transverse distances to the midline lead. Medio-lateral field steering was performed with the midline lead and the second lead on each side to achieve constant anodal current ratios and variable anodal current ratios. Results: Reducing the transverse lead separation resulted in increasing the depths and widths of the recruited DC area. The triple lead configuration with the least transverse separation had the largest DC recruited area and usage range. The maximum DC recruited area (in terms of both depth and width) was always found to be larger under variable anodal current ratio than constant anodal current ratio conditions. Conclusions: Triple leads programmed to perform as longitudinal guarded cathodes provide more postoperative flexibility than single and <b>dual</b> <b>leads</b> in covering a larger width of the low-thoracic DCs. The transverse separation between the leads is {{a major determinant of}} the area and distribution of paresthesi...|$|R

500|$|Following the {{production}} struggles of The Lord of the Rings, Bakshi decided {{to work on}} something more personal. He pitched American Pop to Columbia Pictures president Dan Melnick. Bakshi wanted to produce a film in which songs would be given a new context in juxtaposition to the visuals. American Pop follows four generations of a Russian Jewish immigrant family of musicians, whose careers parallel the history of American pop and starred actor Ron Thompson in a <b>dual</b> <b>lead</b> role. While the film does not reflect Bakshi's own experiences, its themes were strongly influenced by people he had encountered in Brownsville. The film's crew included character layout and design artist Louise Zingarelli, Vita, Barry E. Jackson, and Marcia Adams. Bakshi again used rotoscoping, {{in an attempt to}} capture the range of emotions and movement required for the film's story. According to Bakshi, [...] "Rotoscoping is terrible for subtleties, so it was tough to get facial performances to match the stage ones." [...] Bakshi was able to acquire the rights to an extensive soundtrack—including songs by Janis Joplin, The Doors, George Gershwin, The Mamas & the Papas, Herbie Hancock, Lou Reed, and Louis Prima—for under $1 million. Released on February 12, 1981, the film was a financial success. The New York Times Vincent Canby wrote, [...] "I'm amazed at the success that Mr. Bakshi has in turning animated characters into figures of real feelings." [...] Jerry Beck called it [...] "one of Bakshi's best films". Due to music clearance issues, it was not released on home video until 1998.|$|E
500|$|In June 1966, bassist Samwell-Smith {{left the}} Yardbirds {{to become a}} record producer.

With both Beck and Page on board, the Yardbirds {{had one of the}} first <b>dual</b> <b>lead</b> guitar teams in popular rock. [...] Movie director Michelangelo Antonioni saw the group's September 23, 1966, performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London and, being impressed with their version of the song, requested that they perform [...] "Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] for his upcoming film, Blowup. [...] Less than two weeks later, the group entered the Sound Techniques studios in London, where they recorded on October 3–5, 1966. [...] Unable to secure the movie performance rights from the song's publisher, singer Keith Relf wrote new lyrics, renamed it [...] "Stroll On", and included credits to the five band members. [...] The Yardbirds also introduced an updated arrangement to go with the new lyrics. [...] Led Zeppelin biographer Keith Shadwick describes the new version as [...] "brutal, menacing, and teetering on all-out violence", which foreshadows heavy-metal. [...] It opens with a new drum part by Jim McCarty and harmonized guitar feedback, before Beck's train whistle simulation. [...] Unlike their earlier song, Relf's vocal is not double tracked nor does he play harmonica and the rhythm remains on the riff throughout the song. [...] The guitar work, with both Beck and Page contributing lead-guitar parts, has been called [...] "revolutionary", from the opening [...] "wall of feedback", the use of [...] "jarringly dissonant chords", and the [...] "twining guitar duet" [...] by Birnbaum. [...] During October 12–14, the Yardbirds were filmed lip syncing the song for Blowup. [...] Their scene was staged on a set at Elstree Studios designed to resemble the Ricky-Tick, a popular London club and, at Antonioni's direction, Beck smashes his guitar, in the manner of the Who's Pete Townshend. [...] The song as performed in the film is edited (doubled) to increase its length for the story line.
