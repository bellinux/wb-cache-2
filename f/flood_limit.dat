40|$|A {{significant}} portion of the Canadian Maritime coastline has been surveyed with airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). The purpose of these surveys has been to map the risk of flooding from storm surges and projected long-term sea‑level rise from climate change and to include projects in all three Maritime Provinces: Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. LiDAR provides the required details in order to map the flood inundation from 1  to  2  m storm surge events, which cause coastal flooding in many locations in this region when they occur at high tide levels. The community of Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, adjacent to the Bay of Fundy, has been surveyed with LiDAR and a 1 m DEM (Digital Elevation Model) was constructed for the flood inundation mapping. Validation of the LiDAR using survey grade GPS indicates a vertical accuracy better than 30  cm. A benchmark storm, known as the Groundhog Day storm (February 1 – 3, 1976), was used to assess the flood maps and to illustrate the effects of different sea-level rise projections based on climate change scenarios if it were to re-occur in 100 years time. Near shore bathymetry has been merged with the LiDAR and local wind observations used to model the impact of significant waves during this benchmark storm. Long-term (ca. greater than 30 years) time series of water level observations from across the Bay of Fundy in Saint John, New Brunswick, have been used to estimate return periods of water levels under present and future sea-level rise conditions. Results indicate that under current sea-level rise conditions this storm has a 66 year return period. With a modest relative sea-level (RSL) rise of 80 cm/century this decreases to 44 years and, with a possible upper limit rise of 220 cm/century, this decreases further to 22 years. Due to the uncertainty of climate change scenarios and sea-level rise, flood inundation maps have been constructed at 10 cm increments up to the 9 m contour which represents an upper <b>flood</b> <b>limit</b> estimate in 100 years, based on the highest predicted tide, plus a 2 m storm surge and a RSL of 220  cm/century...|$|E

In this research {{and in order}} to improve spinning cone column design and predict tower capacity, the <b>flooding</b> <b>limits,</b> pressure drop, the effect of tray speed, cone spacing, flooding for both industrial and small scale operation have been assessed using artificial neural network. Furthermore, variation of gas and liquid flow rate in an industrial scale spinning cone column has also been studied. From {{the findings of this study}} and from the flooding graph obtained from this work, the spinning cone column capacity in different operating conditions could be estimated. The findings of this study reveal that the predictions of this work are much accurate than those obtained from the existing empirical correlation (about 10 %). There also exists a good compatibility between the predicted pressure drop values of the present study and the experimental data in both dry and wet state (MSE[*]=[*] 0.0021, MAE[*]=[*] 5 %, and NB[*]=[*]; 0.00232). Therefore, the findings of this study shows that the artificial neural nets technique with multilayer perceptron structure and Levenberg-Marquart training algorithm could be applied as a powerful tool and a cost and time effective way in predicting the spinning cone column capacity and the pressure drop.|$|R

The model {{is based on the}} volume-average mass and momentum balance equations and the double-slitdrag closures.

The incidence on the column-limited flooding point of packing geometry (porosity and specific surface area), fluid through-puts and properties (viscosity, gas and liquid densities) and liquidspreading characteristics was discussed from the perspective of model simulated trends. Gravity was unveiled as the mos timportant factor in the stabilization force which contributes to the attenuation of liquid waves inducing a tendency to make the flow more uniform. Its contribution was factor edin using a modified capillary pressure model. Beside gravity, this formulation indicated that the stabilizing role of capillary forces could notbe disregarded, particularly for lower values of the gravity scaling factor in liquid-rich regions at relativelyhigh liquid flow rates...|$|R
