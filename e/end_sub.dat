30|$|The main {{motivation}} {{of the current}} study is to overcome the existing problems in the previously proposed methods and to preserve the transitions at a relatively lower computational cost without introducing any oscillations. The new technique worked on the idea of splitting the signal. The method segments the signal based on the sharpness of its transitions. In this way, the main transitions presented inside the signal have been preserved at the initial stage. This segmentation is performed by Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) based nonlinear thresholding of WTMM. Once the signal has been split into different sub signals, Lipschitz exponents were computed for all the significant transitions present inside each sub signal. These Lipschitz exponents permit to separate the regular or smooth points from the noise elements. At the final stage, signal reconstruction involves in finding the best compromise between the data points and the smoothness criterion. At the <b>end,</b> all <b>sub</b> signals were merged together to reconstruct the fully denoised signal.|$|R

The rationale behind the analysis is that the applicable energy technologies have gone through fundamental changes and these have profound effects on the competitiveness of the various options. The least cost distributed generation options are calculated for each geographical location for mini hydro,off grid PV and diesel generators options and it is compared to the electricity grid extension. The methodology presented in this manuscript organises the scarcely available energy-related local and regional geo-information in to comprehensible maps. The set of tools presented and the results based on those analyses can support decision and policy makers to plan for the least- cost rural electrification options while also adapting to {{the most effective way to}} reduce energy poverty.

Second, Boehm's estimate relies on additional undocumented, judgment based factors to adjust for rising computer usage rates; we address this weakness by integrating fresh Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data and projections as well as a richer estimation method. With these improvements to Boehm’s method, we estimate that in 2012 there will be 90 million end users in American workplaces. Of these, we anticipate that over 55 million will use spreadsheets or databases (and therefore may potentially program), while over 13 million will describe themselves as programmers, compared to BLS projections of fewer than 3 million professional programmers.

Water maser emission is a good tracer of energetic processes, such as mass-loss and/or accretion, and is a useful tool to study this processes with very high angular resolution. This type of emission has been confirmed in objects with L_ bol> 1 L_. Objects with lower luminosities also undergo mass-loss and accretion, and thus, are prospective sites of maser emission. Our sensitive single-dish observations provided a single detection when pointing toward the FHC L 1448 IRS 2 E. However, follow-up interferometric observations showed water maser emission associated with the nearby YSO L 1448 IRS 2 (a Class 0 protostar of L_ bol≃ 3. 6 - 5. 3 L_), and {{did not find any}} emission toward L 1448 IRS 2 E. The upper limits for water maser emission determined by our observations are one order of magnitude lower than expected from the correlation between water maser luminosities and bolometric luminosities found for YSOs. This suggests that this correlation does not hold at the lower <b>end</b> of the (<b>sub)</b> stellar mass spectrum. Possible reasons are that the slope of this correlation is steeper at L_ bol< 1 L_, or that there is an absolute luminosity threshold below which water maser emission cannot be produced. Alternatively, if the correlation still stands at low luminosity, the detection rates of masers would be significantly lower than the values obtained in higher-luminosity Class 0 protostars.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a simple approach for load flow {{analysis of a}} radial distribution network. The proposed approach utilizes forward and backward sweep algorithm based on Kirchoff’s current law (KCL) and Kirchoff’s voltage law (KVL) for evaluating the node voltages iteratively. In this approach, computation of branch current depends only on the current injected at the neighbouring node and the current in the adjacent branch. This approach starts from the <b>end</b> nodes of <b>sub</b> lateral line, lateral line and main line and moves towards the root node during branch current computation. The node voltage evaluation begins from the root node and moves towards the nodes located {{at the far end}} of the main, lateral and sub lateral lines. The proposed approach has been tested using four radial distribution systems of different size and configuration and found to be computationally efficient.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} set of convergence tests which explore {{the role of}} various numerical parameters on the equilibrium structure of a simulated dark matter halo. We report results obtained with two independent, state-of-the-art, multi-stepping, parallel N-body codes: PKDGRAV and GADGET. We find that convergent mass profiles can be obtained for suitable choices of the gravitational softening, timestep, force accuracy, initial redshift, and particle number. For softenings chosen so that particle discreteness effects are negligible, convergence in the circular velocity is obtained at radii where the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the timestep is much shorter than the local orbital timescale; (ii) accelerations do not exceed a characteristic acceleration imprinted by the gravitational softening; and (iii) enough particles are enclosed so that the collisional relaxation timescale is longer than {{the age of the}} universe. The most stringent requirement for convergence is typically that imposed on the particle number by the collisional relaxation criterion, which implies that in order to estimate accurate circular velocities at radii where the density contrast may reach ∼ 10 ^ 6, the region must enclose of order 3000 particles (or more than a few times 10 ^ 6 within the virial radius). Applying these criteria to a galaxy-sized ΛCDM halo, we find that the spherically-averaged density profile becomes progressively shallower from the virial radius inwards, reaching a logarithmic slope shallower than - 1. 2 at the innermost resolved point, r ∼ 0. 005 r_ 200, with little evidence for convergence to a power-law behaviour in the inner regions.

Cd uptake and distribution of Cd was determined in whole egg compared to inside egg content only, and in whole alevin compared to yolk sac only.

40|$|Writing {{under the}} {{pseudonym}} Ivor de Wofle, editor (Architects' Journal and Architectural Review 1927 - 1973) Hubert de Cronin Hastings begins his 1971 book Civilia: the <b>end</b> of <b>sub</b> urban man; {{a challenge to}} Semidetsia with an annotation advising town planners to disregard the publication. Aptly titled ‘Stick it’ Wofle suggests {{the content of the}} book is better served in the hands of ordinary people in the course of intelligent lay discussion and free from the veil of mystique available only to specialists who make decisions behind closed doors. Proposing the development of a low-rise high-density city built on an area of spoil-tips and quarries in landlocked Warwickshire in England, Civilia describes a future city designed to release citizens caught in an onslaught of hazards to their personal freedom. Wofle pits his ideas for development against the diluted effects of modernism in the 1960 s and 70 s. Low-cost, systems-based building used as an instrument for creating cheap modern architecture and calculating economically favourable land-use planning had propagated a centrifugal force outwards. Development emerged on the periphery of cities - new towns situated somewhere between escape and participation – lacking the infrastructure of self-sufficiency and economic independence and heralding the birth of the commute, congestion and urban sprawl. Wofle argued this new planning standard was based on an over-simplified and clichéd definition of society crudely borrowed from the economic principle of supply and demand. He determined that architectural and urban development was dominated by patterns of contacts mapping access to goods and services (production and consumption). The supply and demand of which, move individuals through an environment in different directions, placing different pressures on the environment’s available resources. Architect and theorist Christopher Alexander developed his radical theory of planning and building A Pattern Language (1977) on processes that embodied living patterns - relationships between workplace, family, recreation, contemplation etc. Alexander shared Wofle’s belief in the redundancy of the specialized voice, buildings and planning based on patterns requiring the force of law or economic exchange to function were in his view dead and ineffective. Both argued that responding to the organic, contradictory and diverse elements that make up human life better determined effective patterns of settlement. Alexander and Wofle’s utopian projections were underpinned by philosophies of collaboration and empowerment that emerged from modernism. The economic and bureaucratic processes that influence planning and design arguably defeated their ideals. A planning policy has emerged simplifying patterns of human settlement into categories of economically motivated behaviour. To what extent do the values of growth and progress take precedence over the human experience of inhabiting space? In order to preserve a way of life, do we now require utopian visions of contemporary cities and societies to remain passive as symbols and memorials of hope and change?...|$|R

40|$|During {{the long}} {{shutdown}} LS 3 when the LHC will be upgraded to the HL-LHC, the inner tracker of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC will be replaced. This {{also includes the}} innermost part of ATLAS, the pixel detector. The goal is to collect 3000 /fb with this detector. To ensure a stable and reliable operation for this time (~ 10 years), {{there has to be}} a control system which steers and monitors the detector, similar to the detector control system (DCS) of the current pixel detector. Due to massive changes in the concept of the new pixel detector, the current DCS cannot be reused and a new one is being developed. This new DCS concept for the pixel detector contains three paths, a hard wired interlock path, a diagnostics path integrated into the data acquisition and a control and feedback path for user interactions during operation. In this contribution we describe an improved concept of the control and feedback path, especially designed for the case of a serially powered detector. Though the operation of a parallel powering scheme with DC-DC converters is also possible. The control and feedback path is made up by a network of two nodes: The first node, the DCS controller, is located at the End-of-Stave card at the <b>end</b> of each <b>sub</b> structure (disc or half stave). The second node, the DCS chip, is located on the flex attached to each detector module. To cope with the high radiation levels and the low material budget, these nodes are implemented in custom made ASICs. Communication between these two nodes is transmitted by an I 2 C bus, which was enhanced with four check bits to provide better reliability. To meet the standards of the ATLAS DCS, the communication from the DCS chip to the DCS computers is realized by a CAN bus. Besides the new concept, the first prototype of the DCS chip the PSPP (Pixel Serial Powering and Protection) chip will be introduced. This chip contains all components, which are foreseen in the concept of the DCS chip. This includes the physical layer for an AC coupled two wire bus, a shunt regulator, a large shunting transistor, an ADC, I 2 C slave logic and a comparator.

40|$|In the {{following}} research I discuss {{a number of issues}} which are fundamental to my understanding of how best to reconstruct past human events from the methodological outlook of a legal historian. Herein one will find an explanation of and justification for the various aspects of the historical method and philosophy I employ in my larger research area involving the Roman Emperor Constantine, the Christian Church, and state sovereignty. I also discuss some lines of intersection between modern day legal actors and historians to show how their common goal of getting to the truth of a question may encourage the former to consider using some of the same hermeneutical tools as the latter. History as a discipline has always been primarily concerned with humans and their actions, and this has been noted by many historians: Marc Bloch and R. G. Collingwood come to mind as being two of the strongest proponents of this dictum. Since the field of human events in the past is so large, I suggest it behooves us, then, not to confine ourselves too narrowly within our investigations concerning the hermeneutical tools we employ {{in the study of the}} multivariate ways that humans have acted and existed since their appearance some two-hundred thousand years ago: and to this <b>end</b> I employ <b>Sub</b> specie aeternitatis as my research’s inclusive-contextual raison d'être. This perspective requires an acknowledgment that scholarly observations about the reality of the human condition from other disciplines must be employed in the effort to be as wide-ranging in our research method gathering as the historical method will allow: and thus a number of key contributions from authors in various academic fields will be discussed to highlight the relative importance of their ideas to my own. I will be using examples within my own area of study to engage these ideas and this will better acquaint the reader with how I approach historical data. This discussion will be purposely focused on the foundational ideas upon which my own historical method is based. This will enable the reader to better appreciate how it is that I as a historian come up with suggestions about what it was in history that most likely happened. I conclude that as a historian my highest goal must be to offer an imaginative re-construction of an historical event and its concomitant personages which is based on extant data, but which also must engage in a participatory re-thinking pursuant to the motivations of the characters involved such that the end result can be read as an intelligible whole...|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the well}} {{received}} release of Frigid Stars LP (1990), Codeine accepted and invitation from David Grubbs and John McEntire to open for their group Bastro on their European tour in 1991. To {{prepare for the}} tour, Codeine and Bastro met in a studio to record the song [...] "Produkt" [...] and [...] "A l'Ombre de Nous" [...] as a seven-inch single for the label Glitterhouse. Following the tour, Immerwahr returned to New York working as an engineer at Mike McMacklin's Sound on Sound studio. John Engle worked as a delivery man for a restaurant and Chris Brokaw waited tables and wrote songs with Thalia Zedek that would later be released on Eleven:Eleven, the debut album for Come. [...] "1992 was a very hard year for Codeine. Unlike the two Frigid Stars sessions, all our recordings went terribly" [...] Stephen Immerwahr on the failed recording sessions of The White Birch which became Barely Real. Towards the <b>end</b> of 1991, <b>Sub</b> Pop gave the group $1000 to record the July 1992 entry in the labels singles club series. The group entered James Kavoussi's Toxic Shock Studios on Broadway in New York with Frigid Stars LP producer Mike McMacklin to record early versions of [...] "Realize", [...] "Jr", and a cover of the MX-80 song [...] "Promise of Love". The tracks were not successful with only [...] "Promise of Love" [...] being usable. Engle noted that Codeine desired the song to be loud {{on both sides of}} the single, but could not get the song [...] "Jr" [...] to come together. The group had already gone through most of their budget for recording, which led to the group going to an eight-track studio in the Boston suburb of Allston. Immerwahr went into the studio where the group were able to complete a version of the song [...] "Realize". The group met up again to work in early 1992 towards their second LP (Long playing record) The White Birch, with recording commencing in June at Harold Dessau Recording at 25 Murray Street in Manhattan. At the studio, the group attempted to record versions of [...] "Realize", [...] "Jr", [...] "Tom", [...] "Wird" [...] "Smoking Room", [...] "Barely Real", [...] "Something New" [...] and [...] "Sea" [...] within a months time. Immerwahr was not content with the tracks, noting several issues such as: his own vocals, his desire to record music with even slower tempos, and the presence of high pitched noises in the songs that no one else could hear. On attempting to fix a broken toilet at the studio, Immerwahr accidentally flooded the clothing store below the studio.|$|R
