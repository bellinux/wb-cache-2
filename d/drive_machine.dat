40|$|The {{drive system}} is a key {{component}} of an elevator installation that supplies energy into the system, coupling the car-rope and the counterweight-rope subsystems. However, it often becomes a source of excitation that is responsible for vibrations that compromise the car ride quality.

40|$|Conventionally, {{electric}} powertrain in battery {{electric vehicles}} are designed and optimized {{for a particular}} vehicle category and performance requirements. In this thesis the design of an electric powertrain using two different type of machine is proposed which can be implemented across passenger vehicle categories and provide various performance levels. One of the machine will be high efficiency and the other capable of providing high peak power. The powertrain is dimensioned by analysing existing combustion engine based as well as battery electric vehicle specifications along with wheel load analysis performed on simplified vehicle models using standard drive cycles. Two different vehicle models representing a small and medium sized car is used. The acceleration requirements of various drive cycles are observed to mainly determine the peak power of the powertrain. A V-shaped interior permanent magnet machine is designed to support most of the drive cycle requirements with an electromagnetically excited synchronous machine to provide overloading capabilities. To compare the proposed drive system with the two different machines, a third machine using the same V-shaped magnet geometry is designed to represent a conventional electric powertrain. The proposed drive system is observed to achieve similar torque speed operating boundary as the centralized drive using single machine. The peak efficiency of the centralized drive motor was observed to be higher and the efficiency contours were wider as expected. However, the average operating efficiency of the centralized <b>drive</b> <b>machine</b> {{was found to be}} inferior to the proposed design. It was observed that the proposed design of the powertrain can result in higher operating efficiency while providing a scalablity of peak power...|$|E
40|$|Vertical {{vibrations}} affect passenger comfort {{during an}} elevator travel. This work {{presents the results}} of a study of vertical vibrations caused by torque ripple generated at the elevator drive system. Tests are performed on a 1 : 1 roping configuration laboratory model; the acceleration response at the suspended masses and at the <b>drive</b> <b>machine,</b> the machine shaft velocity and the three phase current intensities supplied to the machine are measured during several travels. The machine torque is estimated from the current intensities. Anon stationary model of an elevator is then developed to simulate the acceleration response. The model accommodates the drive system dynamics. The machine parameters are computed by means of the Finite Element Method simulation software FLUX. FLUX computes the amplitudes of the torque ripple and the radial forces at the air-gap. As the torque ripple computed by FLUX is smaller than that torque estimated from the machine currents, the latter is added as a perturbation to the controller generated torque. With respect to the car– counterweight–sheave–ropes assembly a five degree-of-freedom lumped-parameter model (LPM) and a novel distributed-parameter one (DPM) are developed. The elevator dynamics represented by the DPM is described by a partial differential equation set that is discretised by expanding the vertical displacements in terms of the linear stationary mode shapes of a system composed of three masses constrained by the suspension rope. The models are implemented in the MATLAB/Simulink computational environment and the system response is determined through numerical simulation. It is shown that the LPM forms a good approximation of the DPM. The frequency content of the computed and measured accelerations demonstrates that the elevator car vibrates at frequencies generated at the machine, especially when they are close to the system natural frequencies...|$|E
40|$|Financial fraud rampages onwards {{seemingly}} uncontained. The {{annual cost}} of fraud in the UK {{is estimated to be}} as high as £ 193 bn a year [1]. From a data science perspective and hitherto less explored this thesis demonstrates how the use of linguistic features to drive data mining algorithms can aid in unravelling fraud. To this end, the spotlight is turned on Financial Statement Fraud (FSF), known to be the costliest type of fraud [2]. A new corpus of 6. 3 million words is composed of 102 annual reports/ 10 -K (narrative sections) from firms formally indicted for FSF juxtaposed with 306 non-fraud firms of similar size and industrial grouping. Differently from other similar studies, this thesis uniquely takes a wide angled view and extracts a range of features of different categories from the corpus. These linguistic correlates of deception are uncovered using a variety of techniques and tools. Corpus linguistics methodology is applied to extract keywords and to examine linguistic structure. N-grams are extracted to draw out collocations. Readability measurement in financial text is advanced through the extraction of new indices that probe the text at a deeper level. Cognitive and perceptual processes are also picked out. Tone, intention and liquidity are gauged using customised word lists. Linguistic ratios are derived from grammatical constructs and word categories. An attempt is also made to determine ‘what’ was said as opposed to ‘how’. Further a new module is developed to condense synonyms into concepts. Lastly frequency counts from keywords unearthed from a previous content analysis study on financial narrative are also used. These features are then used to <b>drive</b> <b>machine</b> learning based classification and clustering algorithms to determine if they aid in discriminating a fraud from a non-fraud firm. The results derived from the battery of models built typically exceed classification accuracy of 70 %. The above process is amalgamated into a framework. The process outlined, driven by empirical data demonstrates in a practical way how linguistic analysis could aid in fraud detection and also constitutes a unique contribution made to deception detection studies...|$|E
