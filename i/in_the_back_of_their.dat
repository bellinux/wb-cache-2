5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

25|$|The finals {{were also}} {{the first time that}} players had their shirt numbers printed on the center front (or on the right or left breast, in Morocco's and Russia's case respectively) of the shirt, as well as their names printed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> jerseys in a World Cup, just as other American sports did, to make their {{identification}} easier for sportscasters. This custom followed from Euro 92, and has followed ever since (although the numbers printed on the center front were experimented during 1991 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Portugal).|$|E
500|$|Ghost in the Shell {{influenced}} {{a number}} of prominent filmmakers. The Wachowskis, creators of The Matrix and its sequels, showed it to producer Joel Silver, saying, [...] "We wanna do that for real." [...] The Matrix series took several concepts from the film, including the Matrix digital rain, which {{was inspired by the}} opening credits of Ghost in the Shell, and the way people accessed the Matrix through holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> necks. Other parallels have been drawn to James Cameron's Avatar, Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and Jonathan Mostow's Surrogates.|$|E

They told Huie that while they were beating Till, he called them bastards, declared he {{was as good as}} they, and said that he had sexual encounters with white women. They put Till <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> truck, drove to a cotton gin to take a [...] fan—the only time they admitted to being worried, thinking that by this time in early daylight they would be spotted and accused of stealing—and drove for several miles along the river {{looking for a place to}} dispose of Till.

500|$|Smithers {{was partly}} {{based on how}} {{numerous}} Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw {{too much attention to}} it and should try to keep it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads. [...] Jay Kogen said [...] "Originally he was gay and black...But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay." [...] The script for [...] "Blood Feud" [...] originally featured Smithers saying [...] "Just leave me enough to get home to my wife and kids", but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers. The name Waylon was first used in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E

2500|$|Venomous snakes {{that use}} hemotoxins usually have fangs {{in the front}} of their mouths, making it easier for them to inject the venom into their victims. Some snakes that use {{neurotoxins}} (such as the mangrove snake) have fangs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mouths, with the fangs curled backwards. This makes it difficult both for the snake to use its venom and for scientists to milk them. Elapids, however, such as cobras and kraits are proteroglyphous—they possess hollow fangs that cannot be erected toward the front of their mouths, and cannot [...] "stab" [...] like a viper.

2500|$|Neuro-linguistic {{programming}} (NLP) is {{an approach}} to communication, personal development, and psychotherapy created by Richard Bandler and John Grinder in California, United States in the 1970s. NLP's creators claim {{there is a connection}} between neurological processes (neuro-), language (linguistic) and behavioral patterns learned through experience (programming), and that these can be changed to achieve specific goals in life. Bandler and Grinder also claim that NLP methodology can [...] "model" [...] the skills of exceptional people, allowing anyone to acquire those skills. They claim as well that, often in a single session, NLP can treat problems such as phobias, depression, tic disorders, psychosomatic illnesses, near-sightedness, GINA: [...] I have seen you demonstrate a technique that some people refer to as Dr. Bandler's Beauty treatment? Please tell us about that. RICHARD : [...] Basically what happened is that I noticed that when I hypnotically regress people repeatedly they looked younger. So I started first thinking, well isn't there a way to maintain that. I noticed when I hypnotically regressed people to before the age of 5, who currently wore glasses, didn't need them to see. So I started leaving people's eyes young and growing the rest of them up to the present and it would change the prescription of their glasses radically {{to the point where they}} could see better. And done enough times, some of them could see without glasses. So I went a little step further, and did a DHE (Design Human Engineering™) treatment where we set up a mechanism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mind that repeatedly age regresses them hypnotically; when they sleep, when they blink, all kinds of things and in a state of time distortion. And it can take years off the way people look, it also ups their energy level and in some cases the bi product [...] has been they recovered spontaneously from very serious diseases. Because they were aged regressed to where before the disease started. Now I cannot prove that but I've seen it enough times that I'm impressed with it.}} allergy, common cold, and learning disorders.|$|E
