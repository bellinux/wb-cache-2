They are fabricated by <b>electro-chemical</b> pore <b>etching</b> of lithographically prestructured Si wafers, with pore diameters {{in the range of}} 1. 5 µm [1]- 0. 5 µm [2] having a pore depth of about 100 µm. As Fig. 1 shows, experimental measurements (details see [3]) can routinely be interpreted, e. g., in terms of calculated band structures (PBS). Fig. 1 : Measured Γ-M reflectivity (E-Pol.) com-pared to band structures (2 D triangular lattice, circular pores, a= 0. 5 µm, r/a= 0. 425, 967 waves). The quality of the lattices, especially the size distribution and the shape of the air columns, have been inspected by scanning electron microscopy. It turned out that there can be significant modifications of the optimum circular pore geometry to other geometrical forms, probably caused by the square etch-pits and by the pore formation process. Fig. 2 : SEM image of a Si-based photonic crystal with non-circular pores. For a given dielectric contrast εs /εb, the dispersion of the bands can be controlled by the lattice type (square, triangular), the pore size (air filling factor) and the shape of the pores.

Molten aluminum was transported from Reynolds and Alcoa reduction plants to the foundry, inside thermos tank trucks. The block was cast using the Accurad process. The casting process provided a uniform distribution of fine primary silicon particles approximately 0.001 in in size. Pure silicon provides a hard scuff and wear resistant surface, having a rating of 7 on the mohs scale of hardness, the same as quartz, as compared to diamond which is 10. The blocks were aged 8 hours at [...] to achieve dimensional stability. The technical breakthroughs of the block lay in the precision die-casting method used to produce it, and in the silicon alloying which provided a compatible bore surface without liners. Before being shipped to Tonawanda, the blocks were impregnated with sodium silicate, where they were machined through the outer skin.From Massena, the cast engine blocks were shipped as raw castings to Chevy's engine plant in Tonawanda, New York. Here they underwent the messy etch and machining operations.

40|$|Porous silicon is {{generally}} achieved through <b>electro-chemical</b> <b>etching</b> or chemical etching of bulk silicon in hydrofluoric acid based solutions. The work presented here explores {{the effect of}} a chemical etching process on a metallurgical grade silicon powder. It is found that the metallurgical grade silicon particles contain surface bound impurities that induce a porous structure formation upon reaction with the chemical etchant applied. The correlation between the resultant porous structure formed due to the material composition is examined in detail. The elemental composition is determined using a combination of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy. The porous structure is analysed using Transmission Electron Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Three samples of the silicon particles analysed for this study include an un-etched bulk silicon powder sample and two samples of chemically etched powder. Pore formation within the particles is found to be dependent on the presence, dispersion, and local concentration of surface bound impurities within the starting powder. PUBLISHEDpeer-reviewe...|$|E

It {{has been shown in}} a previous work, that this emitter has especially in th e spectral region > 8 µm significantly higher emissivity than commercial availabl e emitters. Due to the thin-film technology of MEMS-based emitters, these types can be typically operated with a maximum temperature of 700 °C to 800 °C. Higher t emperature causes degradation of the heater. But higher temperatures also mean a n enhancement in radiation power and thus open a wider area of application. The presented work shows a temperature enhanced thermal emitter with a ceramic heate r passivation. Short time tests show the possibility of a maximum temperature of 1000 °C. The part of light emitted by the microcavities in comparison to the who le device as well as the influence of the pore size concerning the emitted spect ral range is investigated.

RNDr. Jan Valenta, Ph.

Nanodiamonds and commercial CdSe quantum dots {{have been used as}} comparative materials. Silicon nanocrystals are relatively small (1 - 4 nm) compared to other studied nanomaterials.

Luminescence quantum efficiency can be as high as 30 % and perfectly photostable even in biological environment. Si nanocrystals are biodegradable in a living organism within reasonable time scale and non-toxic. We are able to detect luminescence of single nanocrystals, even inside living cells, with use of our micro-spectroscopy apparatus.

40|$|Abstract. The {{low yield}} rate in display panel {{production}} {{that results from}} imperfect Indium Tin Oxide layer deposition is well known. In this experiment a 6 th Generation TFT-LCD is used to investigate an ultra-precise method {{for the removal of}} Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) thin film microstructure from defective display panels. The complete removal of the ITO layer makes it possible to put these panels back into the production line for reuse with a considerable reduction of both waste and production cost. This process, which involves the removal of ITO layer substructure by means of an <b>electro-chemical</b> <b>etching</b> process, is of major interest to the optoelectronics semiconductor industry. The ITO film can be removed completely by a proper combination of feed rate and electric power. In this electro machining process a high current flow and high feed rate of the display (color filter) achieves complete and efficient removal of the ITO layer. A large diameter cathode virtual rotation circle also corresponds to a higher removal rate. A small cathode end radius effectively improves dregs discharge and is an advantage when associated with a high workpiece feed rate. This precision reuse process for the recycling of defective display screen color filters is presented as an effective tool for use in the screen manufacturing process. The defective Indium Tin Oxide thin-film can be removed easily and cleanly in a short time...|$|E
40|$|Semiconducting {{materials}} exhibit {{electrical conductivity}} {{in the region}} between that of metals and insulators. The electronic properties depend upon the particular element {{and the level of}} impurities contained within it. These materials are the basis of today's electronics industry with silicon being the most important element. It was believed until recently that efficient photoluminescence in the visible region was not possible from silicon due to its relatively small, indirect band-gap (1. 12 eV). For this reason semiconductors with a larger, direct band-gap such as gallium arsenide have been used for optical devices. Photoluminescence from silicon has been observed in the infrared region but this was of little use to the opto-electronics industry. However, when silicon {{is in the form of}} small nano-structures, photoluminescence can be observed in the visible region from red to blue. This photoluminescence corresponds to a shift in the band gap to between 1. 5 eV and 4. 5 eV. This is in accordance with the predictions of quantum mechanics for structures of this scale. Nano-structures of silicon and of other semiconductors are relatively easy to produce. <b>Electro-chemical</b> <b>etching</b> is by far the most reliable method, resulting in uniform and reproducible structures. Anodic etching in a hydrofluoric acid based etch solution results in the silicon becoming porous to a depth of the order of microns. The lateral dimensions of these porous structures are in the range of a few nanometres resulting in an aspect ratio of the order of 1000 : 1. These materials studied in this work have been studied with the aid of EXAFS, scanning probe microscopy and Muon spectroscopy in order to determine the local structures. Measurements of the photoluminescence intensity have been taken at the synchrotron radiation facility, (Daresbury Laboratory). These results show that the observed photoluminescence is temperature dependent. The porous silicon samples studied for this work showed photoluminescence in the range yellow to red. The photoluminescence intensity was seen to decrease with an increase in temperature. Correspondingly the peak wavelength shifted (by between 12 and 40 nm) towards the blue end of the spectrum as the temperature was reduced from room temperature to 100 K. Scanning probe microscopy and scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of structures within the porous matrix of the order of nanometres. This size of structure is consistent with that predicted by quantum mechanics for the shift in energy levels associated with quantum confinement.
