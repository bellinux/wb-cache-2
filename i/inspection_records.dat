2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{structural}} welding flaws — whose nature and existence {{had been covered}} up by falsified <b>inspection</b> <b>records</b> — led to significant delays and expenses {{in the delivery of}} several submarines being built at the General Dynamics Electric Boat Division shipyard. The yard tried to pass the vast cost overruns directly on to the Navy, while Rickover demanded that the yard make good on its [...] "shoddy" [...] workmanship. The Navy settled with General Dynamics in 1981, paying out $634million of $843million in Los Angeles class submarine cost-overrun and reconstruction claims. Secretary of the Navy John Lehman was partly motivated to seek the agreement in order to continue to focus on achieving President Reagan's goal of a 600-ship Navy, but Rickover was extremely bitter over the General Dynamics yard being paid {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} for its incompetence and deceit, and lambasted both the settlement and Secretary Lehman. This was hardly Rickover's first clash with the defense industry; he was historically hard, even harsh, in exacting high standards from defense contractors.|$|E
