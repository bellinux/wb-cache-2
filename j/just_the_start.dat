60|$|In this neighborhood, where {{oaks and}} pines are about equally dispersed, {{if you look}} through the {{thickest}} pine wood, even the seemingly unmixed pitch-pine ones, you will commonly detect many little oaks, birches, and other hard woods, sprung from seeds carried into the thicket by squirrels and other animals, and also blown thither, but which are over-shadowed and choked by the pines. The denser the evergreen wood, {{the more likely it}} is to be well planted with these seeds, because the planters incline to resort with their forage to the closest covert. They also carry it into birch and other woods. This planting is carried on annually, and the oldest seedlings annually die; but when the pines are cleared off, the oaks, having got <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> they want, and now secured favorable conditions, immediately spring up to trees.|$|E
