5|$|A major {{contributor}} to the sedimentation of the Little Applegate River is McDonald Ditch, an <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditch</b> near McDonald Creek. Built in 1920 to provide water to residents of nearby Wagner Creek, the ditch has failed numerous times, sending several tons of dirt and mud downstream. The Talent Irrigation District approved purchasing a $10,000 monitoring system for the ditch in September 2010, and applied for a $100,000 United States Bureau of Reclamation grant to replace the ditch with pipes.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been cut}} with {{irrigation}} channels, and been {{the site of}} burning and peat working, Salta Moss has different flora than other bogs or mires on the Solway Plain. The Moss today is common ground, but a track runs through it to provide access for local farmers to outlying fields, which surround it. An <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditch</b> has also been dug to provide drainage to the surrounding farmland.|$|E

At a dinner meeting in the village, a villager told the Americans that they should shoot any men seen in the mountains, and asked them if U.S. UAVs were keeping watch nearby. The day before the attack, the militants began flowing water through an <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditch</b> feeding an unused field, creating background noise that masked {{the sounds of the}} advancing fighters.|$|E

25|$|There {{were several}} aspects of Nixon's life that were not brought to the {{attention}} of the jury. He had twice saved people from death — once a drowning boy in a flooded <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditch</b> and the other a woman from a burning plane crash at Houston International Airport (now William P. Hobby Airport) in 1966. He had volunteered to serve in the United States Navy during World War II and received an honorable discharge. He later enlisted in the United States Army, getting a hardship discharge after his father abandoned his mother. Nixon did not tell his lawyers any of this, and they had to discover it through their own private investigations.|$|E
25|$|Another heavy {{engagement}} {{took place}} on June 23 - this time only a few kilometres off the outskirts of Kunduz - when 2nd Company, 391st Mechanized Infantry Battalion and 1st Company, 263rd Airborne Battalion as well as Afghan troops clashed with insurgent forces. At least three Taliban were killed in action and three German soldiers were killed when their armored personnel carrier attempting to evade RPG fire slid down a bank, fell into an <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditch</b> and rolled over. Regular fighting and hostile attacks continued over the following days but resulted in few or no casualties among allied troops. PRT Kunduz and adjacent government facilities in Kunduz were now regularly attacked with mortars and unguided rockets. Potential disaster was only narrowly avoided when a 122mm rocket hit the PRT's mess building, piercing a wall but failing to detonate.|$|E
40|$|Water bodies near {{urban areas}} can suffer a steady {{deterioration}} by anthropogenic activities that impact the environment. The present research aims {{to identify and}} assess the impacts generated by the <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditches</b> Cois, Pulen and Yortuque of Chiclayo's city, Lambayeque, Peru in which were established 12 sampling stations during the months of January to August 2009. The water quality of the <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditches</b> {{was determined by the}} standard methods of the APHA-AWWAWPCF. Air quality was assessed by olfactory perception and landscape by the method of representative subjectivity. The qualitative evaluation of the impacts used the matrix type of Leopold and for the quantitative the method of Fisher-Davis. Based upon the impact levels a proposal of a mitigation plan was generated. It was concluded: 1) The water of the <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditches</b> at present concentrations of BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand), total and thermotolerant 5, 20 coliforms, metals such as lead, cadmium, 5. 20 higher than the MPL(Maximum permitted level) set by the DS-MINAM 002 - 2008 -Peru, is not suitable for crop irrigation, recreational use or as drinking water for animals; 2) The negative environmental impacts of the <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditches</b> on the atmosphere of Chiclayo's city, were valued as significant, very significant and severe; 3) Activities such as dumping domestic waste water, washing of vehicles and the accumulation of solid waste affect the water quality of the <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditches,</b> air quality and the urban landscape...|$|R

25|$|As Thompson was {{speaking}} to Calley, Calley's subordinate, Sergeant David Mitchell, fired into the <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditch,</b> killing any civilians still moving. Thompson and his crew, in disbelief and shock, returned to their helicopter and began searching for civilians they could save. They spotted a group of women, children, and old men in {{the northeast corner of}} the village fleeing from advancing soldiers from the 2nd Platoon, Company C. Immediately realizing that the soldiers intended to murder the Vietnamese civilians, Thompson landed his helicopter between the advancing ground unit and the villagers. He turned to Colburn and Andreotta and told them he would shoot the men in the 2nd Platoon if they attempted to kill any of the fleeing civilians. While Colburn and Andreotta focused their guns on the 2nd Platoon, Thompson located as many civilians as he could, persuaded them to follow him to safer location, and ensured their evacuation with the help of two UH-1 Huey pilots he was friends with.|$|E
25|$|In some {{circumstances}} Front fortifications {{did not follow}} the layout scheme described above. Bunkers and fighting holes were scattered more widely to delay attackers, and create the psychological impression that they were surrounded on all sides. Lookout posts were often positioned on key trails, routes and likely US helicopter landing zones. To enhance their mobility during a defensive battle, numerous air-raid shelters, bunkers and trenches were pre-built in advance around an area of operations. This involved {{an enormous amount of}} labor but proved their value in maneuvering under ARVN/US attacks. Foxholes dug by VC troops during the victorious Battle of Ap Bac are testimony to the insurgents almost religious dedication to field fortifications. The holes were dug so deep that a man could stand inside. Excavation of dirt was from the rear, hiding telltale traces of the digging. Only a direct hit by an artillery shell or bomb could kill troops inside such holes. Behind the line of foxholes, the Viet Cong utilized and improved an <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditch,</b> allowing them concealed movement, communication and transmission of supplies on foot or by sampan. Most of these fighting positions were invisible from the air.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1904, the family {{moved back to the}} United States, after William and Kate fell ill. The family spent the summer of that year in New Hampshire on a farm with Kate’s sister before they {{relocated}} to Des Moines, Iowa. In 1908, the family moved to Farson, Wyoming where they settled for the next five years, living in a small three-room house. During the five years in Farson, Rambo and the family planted crops and raised chickens for food, often struggling to produce enough for all members of the household. When Rambo was sixteen, he began working as a water boy to earn money for the family. He soon got a more permanent job driving a Fresno scraper, a metal basket that dumped dirt into an <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditch,</b> but was subsequently fired after he joined a group of workers protesting the wage. He then worked as an orderly in the local hospital and caught the attention of the resident doctor, who began to teach him common procedures such as catheterization. After the doctor left the hospital, Rambo performed many of the former doctor's duties, assisting in the operating room and helping out with emergencies at midnight. He learned to recognize and use different surgical knives and other tools and started handling the catheterization of paraplegics. He attended a nursing class and was two months short of graduating with a registered nurse's certificate when the family suddenly moved to Idaho after William was asked to preach in Emmett. In March 1914, the family moved again to Chehalis, Washington, where Rambo remained until September 1915, graduating from high school at the age of twenty-one.|$|E

50|$|Local {{farmers and}} ranchers began {{constructing}} irrigation canals to bring water from the Mancos River to cropland and pasture {{in various parts of}} the Mancos Valley in the late 1870s and 1880s, and by the beginning of the 20th century a large network of <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditches</b> and laterals was operating and continues to operate (with improvements) today. In the mid-2000s, a large project, the Mancos Valley Salinity Control Project, was funded by various sources, including the US Bureau of Reclamation, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and local irrigation and water companies and districts. The project, nearly complete in 2010, includes replacing many open <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditches</b> with piping to conserve water and prevent salt contamination from infiltration and evaporation of irrigation water. Many of the original <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditches</b> have been determined to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, together with various archeological sites.|$|R
25|$|On 27 June 2006, a 16-man unit from C Squadron, Special Boat Service and the SRR {{carried out}} Operation Ilois: an {{operation}} that covertly captured four Taliban leaders in compounds {{on the outskirts of}} Sangin, Helmand province. As they returned to their Land Rover vehicles, they were ambushed by an estimated 60 to 70 Taliban insurgents, with one vehicle disabled by Rocket-propelled grenade fire, the team took cover in an <b>irrigation</b> <b>ditch</b> and requested assistance whilst holding off against the Taliban force. The Helmand Battle Group had not been informed of the operation until it went wrong; a Quick reaction force made up of a platoon of Gurkhas responded but ran into another insurgent ambush; one SBS member was seriously injured in the ambush. After an hour (some sources say 3)-long gunfight, Apache attack helicopters, the Gurkha Quick reaction force and the 16-man unit, supported by a U.S. A-10 Thunderbolt and 2 Harrier GR7s managed to break contact and return to the closest forward operating base; two of the four Taliban leaders were killed in the firefight whilst the other two escaped in the chaos. Upon reaching the forward operating base it was discovered that Captain David Patten, SRR, and Sergeant Paul Bartlett, SBS were missing – one was helping wounded out of a vehicle when he was shot and assumed killed, whilst the second went missing during the firefight. A company from the Parachute Regiment in an RAF Chinook took off to find them, a pair of Apaches spotted the bodies and the Parachute Regiment troops recovered them. One SBS member was awarded the MC for his actions in the ambush.|$|E
500|$|In Spring 2005, the Director of Special Forces re-balanced British {{special forces}} {{deployments}} so that Afghanistan {{would be the}} responsibility of the SBS and Iraq would be the 22nd SAS Regiment's. In Spring 2006, the British military deployed over 4,000 troops to southern Afghanistan and the SBS were assigned {{to take the lead in}} supporting the deployment. The SBS were part of Task Force 42/84: the British contingent in the Joint Special Forces command; their deployment with other British special forces units was codenamed Operation Kindle (similar to the SAS and other British SF deployment in Iraq, known as Operation Crichton); the SBS carried out missions all over southern Afghanistan with US Apache helicopters. Along with training and mentoring Afghan Provincial Response Companies, Afghan police tactical units the operated jointly with Coalition SOF, TF 42 conducted operations in direct support of the British Battle Group deployed in Helmand Province and for ISAF SOF Command and operations directly for the Americans in pursuit of high-value targets.
