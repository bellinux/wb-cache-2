500|$|Kyle Busch, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "He {{was on a}} mission today, that's for sure. When Jeff Gordon has a good car {{and he has the}} opportunity to beat you, he's going to beat you. He's my hero. I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years." [...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know I was there, but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly before {{transferring}} to Tokyo in August 1968, Prince William was examined by a Royal Air Force doctor, Henry Bellringer, {{at the request}} of the prince's mother. William told the doctor that he had suffered from fever and cutaneous hepatic symptoms, beginning in December 1965 and lasting several months. He had subsequently noticed that his skin was prone to a blistering rash, particularly on exposure to sunshine. Bellringer tentatively diagnosed porphyria, prescribed sunblock cream and gave him a medical warning card regarding the need to avoid certain medications. Although he was aware of the theory of the royal family's history of porphyria then being proposed by Professor Ida Macalpine and Dr Richard Hunter, he stated he [...] "tried not to let it influence him...with all the symptoms, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> little option but to diagnose the Prince's condition as porphyria." [...] William was later examined by haematologists at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and also by a Professor Ishihara in Tokyo, both of whom also concluded he was suffering from variegate porphyria, by then in remission.|$|E
2500|$|Haneke {{dealt with}} the matter since 1992. The work on the script was {{interrupted}} by a writer's block. Haneke normally wrote out the script exactly before the writing process. This time {{the end of the story}} was not clear to him. He began writing in the hope that this would occur to him at work, but this did not happen. [...] "I have tormented myself terribly with the script and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>with</b> the impression that I have not succeeded in getting the hang of this topic", he said. At the same time the director realized that the Swiss-Canadian Léa Pool with La dernière fugue (2010) had created a similar story, about an old man who is taken care of by his wife. Therefore, he let the project in favor of another. He worked only sporadically on it, until his writer's block loosened and he could finish the script quickly. Haneke wrote it specifically for Trintignant, having already written the scripts for The Piano Teacher (2001) and Caché (2005) specifically for actors (Isabelle Huppert and Daniel Auteuil). Haneke prefers this way of working, because in this way one [...] "writes specifically something that fits to the advantages of each actor and helps to particularly work them out".|$|E
