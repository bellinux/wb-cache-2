5|$|The 1592 date {{remained}} the established one until the 19th century. In the 1870s, however, several publications corrected the <b>dating</b> <b>and</b> {{within a few}} decades 1535 became the generally accepted date. The painting's correct historical context was finally laid bare {{with the publication of}} the censored manuscript from the Vasa Chronicle in 1909.|$|E
5|$|After Oxford, Clinton {{attended}} Yale Law School {{and earned}} a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1973. In 1971, he met fellow law student Hillary Rodham in the Yale Law Library; she was a class year ahead of him. They began <b>dating</b> <b>and</b> were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United States presidential election {{in order to move}} in with her in California.

5|$|Between 56,000 and 32,000 {{years ago}} {{explosive}} volcanic activity occurred at Ciomadul. Both the exact dates {{of the various}} eruptions and {{of the formation of}} the St. Ana and Mohos craters are unclear, partly because dates obtained by potassium-argon <b>dating</b> <b>and</b> other dating techniques deviate from each other. Some eruptions may have reached sub-Plinian strength, ejecting volcanic ash as far as the Black Sea.|$|E

5|$|Divorce {{rates in}} Shanghai and Beijing, China's two most {{populated}} economic centres, have been steadily rising since 2005 with it reaching 30% in 2012.

5|$|Earth is {{the third}} planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life.

Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.|$|E

25|$|ISO 8601 Data {{elements}} and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> times {{is an international}} standard covering the exchange of <b>date</b> <b>and</b> time-related data.

The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> times, so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> times, particularly when data are transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> times.|$|R

5|$|Racial {{tensions}} increased {{after the}} United States Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education to end segregation in public education, which it ruled as unconstitutional. Many segregationists believed the ruling {{would lead to}} interracial <b>dating</b> <b>and</b> marriage. Whites strongly resisted the court's ruling; one Virginia county closed all its public schools to prevent integration. Other jurisdictions simply ignored the ruling. In other ways, whites used stronger measures to keep blacks politically disenfranchised, {{which they had been}} {{since the turn of the}} century. Segregation in the South was used to constrain blacks forcefully from any semblance of social equality.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, it {{is argued}} that {{evolutionary}} theory is circular reasoning, in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution is required to interpret the evidence. An example of this is the claim that geological strata are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in. However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their position relative to other strata and by radiometric <b>dating,</b> <b>and</b> most strata were dated before the theory of evolution was formulated.|$|E

Mary Rose, a lonely, thirty-year-old woman with the {{responsibility}} of looking after her father and brother, leaves Church on an April day in the 1940s. She goes to a Schrafft's outlet and becomes acquainted with a man there ordering food. When she sees him there the next day, the pair begin <b>dating</b> <b>and</b> eventually marry. Together, they have four children. Their first three children, Jacob, Michael, and Annie live with their parents in an Irish-Catholic community on Long Island.|$|E
5|$|The dating of potbelly sculptures {{has been}} {{problematic}} with {{few of the}} earlier known sculptures being found in their original context. Investigators from the 1950s through to the 1970s argued that the style was Olmec derived or perhaps pre-Olmec. Olmec culture is judged to have lasted from 1500 BC through to 400 BC based on radiocarbon dating. Investigations at Santa Leticia were focused on answering the dating problem and securely dated Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 to between 500 BC and AD 100 {{using a combination of}} radiocarbon <b>dating</b> <b>and</b> ceramic evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Cleave's article {{appeared}} in the Evening Standard, Beatles press officer Tony Barrow offered Datebook, a US teen magazine, rights to all four interviews. Barrow believed the pieces were important to show fans that the Beatles were progressing beyond simple pop music and producing more intellectually challenging work. As Datebook was a socially progressive magazine that addressed subjects such as interracial <b>dating</b> <b>and</b> legalization of marijuana, {{it seemed like a}} suitable vehicle to carry this information.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to multiple flybys of near earth asteroids is presented which specifies the launch energy and the asteroid arrival <b>date</b> <b>and</b> computes the launch <b>date</b> <b>and</b> other orbital parameters. Only those trajectories which are within the launch performance capability are computed. This approach {{makes it possible to}} increase the launch energy parameters <b>and</b> arrival <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> to find trajectories for all candidate asteroids. These trajectories, usually hundreds for given launch energy conditions, are then sorted according to the launch <b>date</b> <b>and</b> paired to provide multiple asteroid flybys with similar launch <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> energies. A full-up conic optimization program based on these initial conditions is then used to generate a final trajectory which minimizes the launch and midcourse deep space maneuver velocity requirements...|$|R
