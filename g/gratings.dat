5|$|A {{number of}} fixed {{structures}} can create structural colours, by mechanisms including diffraction <b>gratings,</b> selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres and deformed matrices. Structures can {{be far more}} elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific {{solution to the problem}} of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E

The structural coloration on meat cuts appears {{only after the}} ordered pattern of muscle fibrils is exposed and light is diffracted by the proteins in the fibrils. The coloration or wavelength of the diffracted light depends on the angle of observation and can be enhanced by covering the meat with translucent foils. Roughening the surface or removing water content by drying causes the structure to collapse, thus, the structural coloration to disappear.|$|E

5|$|Furious, already {{partially}} converted {{during the}} war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In {{an attempt to}} minimize air turbulence, she was given no superstructure or island. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard funnel; instead, her boiler uptakes ran {{along the sides of}} the ship and exhausted out of <b>gratings</b> on the rear of the flight deck, or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her half-sisters, Courageous and Glorious, began their conversions to aircraft carriers as Furious neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since Furious had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.|$|E
5|$|In {{animals such as}} on the {{feathers}} of birds and the scales of butterflies, interference is created by a range of photonic mechanisms, including diffraction <b>gratings,</b> selective mirrors, photonic crystals, crystal fibres, matrices of nanochannels and proteins that can vary their configuration. Some cuts of meat also show structural coloration due to the exposure of the periodic arrangement of the muscular fibres. Many of these photonic mechanisms correspond to elaborate structures visible by electron microscopy. In the few plants that exploit structural coloration, brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells. The most brilliant blue coloration known in any living tissue {{is found in the}} marble berries of Pollia condensata, where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils produces Bragg's law scattering of light. The bright gloss of buttercups is produced by thin-film reflection by the epidermis supplemented by yellow pigmentation, and strong diffuse scattering by a layer of starch cells immediately beneath.|$|E
5|$|X-rays {{are used}} to produce the {{diffraction}} pattern because their wavelength λ is typically the same order of magnitude (1–100 angstroms) as the spacing d between planes in the crystal. In principle, any wave impinging on a regular array of scatterers produces diffraction, as predicted first by Francesco Maria Grimaldi in 1665. To produce significant diffraction, the spacing between the scatterers and the wavelength of the impinging wave should be similar in size. For illustration, the diffraction of sunlight through a bird's feather was first reported by James Gregory in the later 17th century. The first artificial diffraction <b>gratings</b> for visible light were constructed by David Rittenhouse in 1787, and Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1821. However, visible light has too long a wavelength (typically, 5500 angstroms) to observe diffraction from crystals. Prior to the first X-ray diffraction experiments, the spacings between lattice planes in a crystal were not known with certainty.|$|E

25|$|Originally, {{high-resolution}} <b>gratings</b> were ruled using high-quality ruling engines whose {{construction was}} a large undertaking. Henry Joseph Grayson designed a machine to make diffraction <b>gratings,</b> succeeding with one of 120,000 lines to the inch (approx. 4,724 lines per mm) in 1899. Later, photolithographic techniques allowed <b>gratings</b> to be created from a holographic interference pattern. Holographic <b>gratings</b> have sinusoidal grooves {{and may not be}} as efficient as ruled <b>gratings,</b> but are often preferred in monochromators because they lead to much less stray light. A copying technique allows high quality replicas to be made from master <b>gratings</b> of either type, thereby lowering fabrication costs.|$|E
25|$|For {{practical}} applications, <b>gratings</b> {{generally have}} ridges or rulings on their surface rather than dark lines. Such <b>gratings</b> {{can be either}} transmissive or reflective. <b>Gratings</b> which modulate the phase rather than the amplitude of the incident light are also produced, frequently using holography.|$|E
25|$|When groove spacing is {{less than}} half the {{wavelength}} of light, the only present order is the m = 0 order. <b>Gratings</b> with such small periodicity are called subwavelength <b>gratings</b> and exhibit special optical properties.

In RCWA method, we calculate up to 20 harmonics, and sweep the launch angle of incident light from 0 to 90 degree. The incident light varies from 100 nm to 1200 nm wavelength. Triangular <b>grating</b> can achieve higher light absorption compared to the rectangular <b>grating.</b> The best top <b>grating</b> is around 200 nm <b>grating</b> period, 100 nm <b>grating</b> height, and 50 % filling factor, which responses to 37 % improvement for triangular <b>grating</b> and 23 % for rectangular <b>grating</b> compared to non-grating case.

The main advantage of this technique is that it uses most of the incoming x-rays that would have been filtered by the crystals.

40|$|Abstract. We report {{here the}} design and {{fabrication}} of an electromechanical tunable <b>grating</b> on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. The tunable <b>grating</b> consists of a submicron electrostatic comb actuator and an expandable freestanding <b>grating.</b> Rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) method is utilized to analyze the optical responses of freestanding <b>grating</b> with different periods and filling factors. Obvious shift of the resonant peaks is obtained by changing the <b>grating</b> period and the <b>grating</b> filling factor.

2500|$|This {{derivation}} of the <b>grating</b> {{equation is}} based on an idealised <b>grating.</b> [...] However, the relationship between the angles of the diffracted beams, the <b>grating</b> spacing and the wavelength of the light apply to any regular structure of the same spacing, because the phase relationship between light scattered from adjacent elements of the <b>grating</b> remains the same. [...] The detailed distribution of the diffracted light depends on the detailed structure of the <b>grating</b> elements {{as well as on the}} number of elements in the <b>grating,</b> but it will always give maxima in the directions given by the <b>grating</b> equation.|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} to use prisms rather than <b>gratings</b> as a dispersive elements, as in Figure 3. Despite such a simple change the set-up behaves quite differently, as to first order no group delay dispersion is introduced. Such a stretcher/compressor can have both a positive or negative dispersion, depending on the geometry and the material properties of the prisms. With lenses, {{the sign of the}} dispersion can be reversed, similar to Figure 2. For a given distance between the dispersive elements, prisms generate much less dispersion than <b>gratings.</b> Prisms and <b>gratings</b> are sometimes combined to correct higher order dispersion ("grisms"), in which case the distance between the prisms is on the order of 10 meters rather than 50cm as with a grating compressor. <b>Gratings</b> lose power into the other orders while prisms lose power due to Rayleigh scattering.|$|E
