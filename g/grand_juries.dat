5|$|The Vicinage Clause {{applies only}} to petit juries, not <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> (although some cases finding no {{violation}} of the Clause have assumed without deciding that the Clause does apply to <b>grand</b> <b>juries).</b>|$|E
5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their client had received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion to throw out the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E
25|$|In the United States jurors for <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> are {{selected}} from jury pools.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> Clause does very little, if anything, to {{regulate}} the procedures of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> For example, the Clause does not prohibit a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> indictment based solely on hearsay evidence. Non-fundamental flaws with the <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> such {{as a violation of}} the defendant's self-incrimination rights or a violation of <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> secrecy do not trigger a right not to be tried. In United States v. Williams (1992), where the Court rejected a rule that would have required [...] "substantial exculpatory evidence" [...] to be presented to the <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> the defendant did not even argue a Fifth Amendment violation. The lack of a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> does not deprive the court of jurisdiction, and the defendant may waive the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> right.|$|R

50|$|Court {{records from}} the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> {{proceeding}} on Rocky Flats have been sealed {{for a number of}} years. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which govern federal <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> proceedings, explicitly require <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> proceedings to be kept secret unless otherwise provided by the Rules. Rocky Flats' secret <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> proceedings were not unique.|$|R
25|$|The {{grand jury}} {{indictment}} {{clause of the}} Fifth Amendment has not been incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment. This means that the grand jury requirement applies only to felony charges in the federal court system. While many states do employ <b>grand</b> <b>juries,</b> no defendant has a Fifth Amendment right {{to a grand jury}} for criminal charges in state court. States are free to abolish <b>grand</b> <b>juries,</b> and many (though not all) have replaced them with preliminary hearing.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} eight years, Gray defended his actions as acting {{director}} of the FBI, testifying before five federal <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> and four committees of Congress.|$|E
25|$|All three {{reporters were}} called to testify before {{separate}} <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> about illegal actions they might have witnessed. They refused, citing a privilege under the Press Clause, and were held in contempt.|$|E
50|$|The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment {{does not}} attach in a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> proceeding, or bar a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> from {{returning}} an indictment when a prior <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> {{has refused to}} do so.|$|R
50|$|A 1979 National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS) {{document}} identifies {{three steps}} {{that could be}} taken to remove the adversary role of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> and make them more independent; (1)- giving {{the target of the}} <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> investigation the opportunity to testify; (2)- making a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> subpoena returnable only when the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> is sitting and identifying the general subject area of the investigation; and (3)- recording all <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> proceedings (except the jurors' deliberations), making them accessible for pretrial discovery.|$|R
25|$|<b>Grand</b> <b>jury</b> {{proceedings}} (without {{defense counsel}} {{and without a}} judge present) in Santa Barbara, starting in March 2004, led to Jackson's indictment on April 21, 2004. The <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> had nineteen jurors; the indictment required the votes of at least twelve jurors. Prosecution witnesses testified without defense cross-examination. The judge ruled that witnesses before the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> could talk to defense attorneys about {{their knowledge of the}} case as long as the witnesses did not tell what they saw in the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> room or what questions they were asked and their answers. Many <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> witnesses were sneaked into the building where the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> was meeting, sometimes covered in blankets to hide their identities. In February 2005 The Smoking Gun published the <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> transcripts (1903 pages).|$|R
25|$|Probable {{cause is}} a {{relatively}} low standard of proof, which {{is used in the}} United States to determine whether a search, or an arrest, is warranted. It is also used by <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> to determine whether to issue an indictment. In the civil context, this standard is often used where plaintiffs are seeking a prejudgement remedy.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to their primary role in screening criminal prosecutions and assisting {{in the investigation of}} crimes, <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> in California, Florida, and some other U.S. states are sometimes utilized to perform an investigative and policy audit function similar to that filled by the Government Accountability Office in the United States federal government and legislative state auditors in many U.S. states.|$|E
25|$|Further reforms for Catholics {{continued}} to 1793, {{when they could}} again vote, sit on <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> and buy freehold land. However they could neither enter parliament nor become senior state officials. Reform stalled because of the French war (1793), but, as the French republicans were opposed to the Catholic Church, in 1795 the government assisted in building St. Patrick's College in Maynooth for Catholic seminarians.|$|E
5000|$|Both the {{prosecutor}} and the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> itself {{have the right}} to call witnesses to testify before the <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> [...] With few exceptions, every witness who testifies before a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> receives transactional immunity automatically, whether they invoke their right to silence or not. [...] If a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> is considering criminal charges against a person, that person has a right to testify before that <b>grand</b> <b>jury,</b> provided they make a timely written demand and then agree to waive their right to immunity. [...] Despite this fact, an unwitting target of a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> proceeding has no right to be informed that their case is even being considered by a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in the first place, unless they have already been arraigned on a felony complaint charging a related crime and are awaiting a preliminary hearing on that complaint. A defendant held in the state may testify to the <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b>|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} 150 {{years of our}} {{constitutional}} history, a valid <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> indictment was deemed to be a mandatory prerequisite to a federal court 2 ̆ 7 s exercise of criminal subject matter jurisdiction. Under that view of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> Clause, a defendant in a federal felony case could neither waive nor forfeit the right to <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> indictment. A critical examination of the historical evidence reveals that the legal realist criminal procedure reform project of {{the early twentieth century}} advanced a pragmatic critique of the usefulness of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that culminated in a provision of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allowing for waiver of <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> indictment for the purpose of facilitating a pre-indictment guilty plea, a procedural efficiency mechanism still used with regularity in federal courts today. The reformers were able to secure the waiver provision - despite serious constitutional concerns - by shaping a pro-efficiency modern understanding of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that obscured - but did not disprove - the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdictional significance. This Article argues that the reformers prompted the subversion of the mandate of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> Clause, and burdened our legal consciousness with a diminished respect for the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that affects our understanding of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> 2 ̆ 7 s place in the constitutional structure to this day. This Article recovers the 2 ̆ 2 jurisdictional heritage 2 ̆ 2 of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> and criticizes the modern understanding for its unjustified dismissal of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdictional significance. The Article places blame for the continued confusion in the federal courts regarding the relationship of <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> and jurisdiction squarely on the weak historical and logical underpinnings of the modern understanding. The Article also contextualizes the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdictional heritage within the broader contemporary discussion of 2 ̆ 2 pro-defendant 2 ̆ 2 formalist or originalist approaches to defining criminal procedural rights recently applied by the Supreme Court. Finally, the Article argues that the failure to account properly for the jurisdictional heritage of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> frustrates the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> 2 ̆ 7 s fulfillment of its role in the constitutional design...|$|R
50|$|The Washington <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> is {{separate}} {{from an earlier}} Virginia <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> investigating Michael Flynn; the Flynn case has been absorbed into the special counsel's overall investigation.

25|$|Federal <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> in Cleveland and Washington, D.C., soon opened {{investigations}} into the FBI's handling of the Presser case as well as whether the promises made by FBI agents had been authorized. Justice Department leaders eventually undertook a prosecution {{of one of the}} FBI field agents who handled Presser, claiming that he had not been authorized to give Presser permission to engage in the payroll-padding scheme.|$|E
25|$|In Forsyth v. United States (1850) and Simpson v. United States (1850), the Court {{held that}} its {{authority}} to hear writs of error from the Florida territorial courts—which {{was defined by}} the organic statute of those courts—extended to criminal cases. Forsyth and Simpson found invalid criminal cases transferred of criminal cases which had begun with indictments by <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> in the territorial courts and then been transferred to the newly created state courts within re-indictment.|$|E
25|$|Besides petit juries for jury {{trials and}} <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> for issuing indictments, juries are {{sometimes}} used in non-legal or quasi-legal contexts. Blue ribbon juries attend to civic matters as an ad-hoc {{body in the}} executive branch of a government. Outside government, a jury or panel of judges may make determinations in competition, such as at a wine tasting, art exhibition, talent contest, or reality game show. These types of contests are juried competitions.|$|E
50|$|A judge, usually {{upon the}} request of a {{district}} attorney, may assemble a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> to investigate suspected criminal activity. A <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> consists of 17 people selected for <b>jury</b> service. The <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> may request that the prosecutor subpoena and examine witnesses. Upon completing an investigation, a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> may by the vote of at least 14 members return an indictment, which is a written accusation that a person committed a crime. If the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> returns an indictment, the court issues a summons or warrant for the defendant.|$|R
50|$|Individuals {{subject to}} <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> {{proceedings}} {{do not have}} a Sixth Amendment constitutional right to counsel in the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> room, nor do they have a Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine witnesses. Additionally, individuals in <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> proceedings can be charged with holding the court in contempt (punishable with incarceration for the remaining term of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury)</b> if they refuse to appear before the jury. Media coverage is not allowed. Furthermore, all evidence is presented by a prosecutor in a cloak of secrecy, as the prosecutor, grand jurors, and the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> stenographer are prohibited from disclosing what happened before the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> unless ordered to do so in a judicial proceeding.|$|R
5|$|If the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> right attaches, {{every element}} of the charged crime must be {{submitted}} to the <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> Thus, the prosecution cannot augment the indictment without returning to a <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> But, the government may narrow the indictment without so returning.|$|R
25|$|In September, <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> indicted {{eighteen}} more people. The {{grand jury}} failed to indict William Proctor, who was re-arrested on new charges. On September 19, 1692, Giles Corey refused to plead at arraignment, and {{was killed by}} peine forte et dure, a form of torture in which the subject is pressed beneath an increasingly heavy load of stones, {{in an attempt to}} make him enter a plea. Four pleaded guilty and eleven others were tried and found guilty.|$|E
25|$|When Stoughton {{wrote the}} {{warrants}} for {{the execution of}} these three and others remaining from the previous court, Governor Phips issued pardons, sparing their lives. In late January/early February, the Court sat again in Charlestown, Middlesex County, and held <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> and tried five people: Sarah Cole (of Lynn), Lydia Dustin & Sarah Dustin, Mary Taylor and Mary Toothaker. All were found not guilty, but not released until they paid their jail fees. Lydia Dustin died in jail on March 10, 1693.|$|E
25|$|The {{extensive}} 1898 Local Government Act {{abolished the}} old landlord-dominated <b>Grand</b> <b>Juries</b> and replaced them by forty-nine county, {{urban and rural}} district councils, managed by Irish people for the administration of local affairs. The councils were very popular in Ireland as they established a political class, who showed themselves capable of running Irish affairs. It also stimulated the desire to attain Home Rule and to manage affairs on a national level. A less positive consequence was that the councils were largely dominated by the Irish Party, becoming the wielders of local patronage.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> can compel {{a witness}} to testify. The target of a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> {{investigation}} {{has no right to}} testify or put on a defense before the <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> The U.S. Attorney's Manual anticipates the possibility of allowing investigatory targets to testify.|$|R
25|$|Reynolds {{argued that}} the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that had indicted him was not legal. United States law at that time {{required}} that a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> consist of no fewer than 16 persons. The <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> that indicted Reynolds had only 15 persons. The court rejected this argument because the Utah Territory had passed a law in 1870 under which a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> had to consist of only 15 persons.|$|R
2500|$|Attorney General Linda Kelly {{prepared}} a presentment which included credibility determinations about the testimonies received {{before the first}} <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> for the second <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> The 33rd Statewide Investigating <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> continued looking into the investigation.

25|$|Al-Arian was subpoenaed {{three times}} to testify in terrorism-related {{investigations}} before Virginia federal <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> between 2006 and 2008. Each time, he refused to testify. He challenged the initial subpoena in four different federal courts, each of which held {{that he was in}} fact required to testify. He was imprisoned for 13 months for civil contempt for failing to testify in compliance with the first subpoena. He is awaiting trial as well for criminal contempt for his failure to testify in compliance with the second and third subpoenas.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} April, the Court {{convened in}} Boston, Suffolk County, and cleared Capt. John Alden by proclamation. It heard charges against a servant girl, Mary Watkins, for falsely accusing her {{mistress}} of witchcraft. In May, the Court convened in Ipswich, Essex County, and held a variety of <b>grand</b> <b>juries.</b> They dismissed charges against all but five people. Susannah Post, Eunice Frye, Mary Bridges Jr., Mary Barker and William Barker Jr. were all found not guilty at trial, finally {{putting an end to}} the series of trials and executions.|$|E
25|$|In {{another such}} case, Clawson v. United States (1885), the Court held {{that there was}} no right to bail on appeal where a {{defendant}} had been sentenced to imprisonment (there was such a right where the only punishment was a fine). Reaching the merits that same year, the Court held that the Congressional statute permitting for-cause challenges of jurors who believed that polygamy was divinely compelled applied to <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> as well as petit juries, and that the marshall could call a second venire if the 200-person venire was exhausted before a full jury was seated.|$|E

40|$|The {{investigations}} of local police officers for causing {{the deaths of}} unarmed civilians in Ferguson, Missouri and Staten Island, New York have generated significant national discourse about the fairness and transparency of <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> proceedings. This article addresses one crucial aspect of this ongoing debate; that is, whether witnesses before the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> {{should be allowed to}} talk to each other and to the media about the contents of their testimony. In the federal system and in the majority of states that still employ the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> as an investigative and charging tool, obligations of <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> secrecy do not extend to the witnesses themselves. Only persons performing an “official function” before the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> are typically covered by the oath of secrecy. Absent a contract or court order, <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> witnesses are free to talk with each other and to the media. Nevertheless, prosecutors often seek to handcuff <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> witnesses in talking to others about their testimony by drafting one-sided cooperation agreements that impose obligations of confidentiality on <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> witnesses in exchange for charging or sentencing concessions. Courts on occasion also impose gag orders on <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> witnesses as part of formal immunity orders. In this article, the author argues that such efforts by prosecutors and courts to impose secrecy obligations on <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> witnesses violate attorney discipline rules and the First Amendment. As importantly, they impede the target’s access to information essential to enable him to marshal a defense, thus undermining the <b>grand</b> <b>jury’s</b> historic function as a shield against unfounded prosecutions...|$|R
