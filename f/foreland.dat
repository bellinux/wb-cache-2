5|$|The rocky cliffs, common {{features}} downstream of the Minho's estuary, disappear in Póvoa de Varzim, {{giving way to}} a coastal plain. The plain {{is located in a}} cuspate <b>foreland,</b> an old marine plateau from the Plio-Pleistocene, conferring a sandy soil to the coastal lands. The sand dunes in the Northwestern coast formed during the Little Ice Age and started piling up in the 15th or 16th century. Wandering along the coast one discerns Cape Santo André, the tip of the cuspate <b>foreland</b> and the Avarus Promontory, referred to by Ptolemy.|$|E
5|$|Exmoor's {{woodlands}} sometimes {{reach the}} shoreline, especially between Porlock and <b>Foreland</b> Point, where they form the single longest stretch of coastal woodland in England and Wales.

5|$|It {{was early}} June before UB-10 sank her next ship. The Belgian ship Menapier, {{carrying}} {{a load of}} iron ore from Algiers for Middlesbrough, was torpedoed and sunk off North <b>Foreland</b> by Steinbrinck on the 7th. Of the 23 persons on board the 1,886-ton ship, only 6 were saved. Menapiers master, his wife, and six-year-old daughter, the first mate, the pilot, and 12 other crewmen perished.|$|E
50|$|The {{management}} of coastlines {{needs to take}} into account the natural processes that occur on cuspate <b>forelands</b> since many provide a habitat for birds. Alternative ways of managing coastal erosion is needed, such as the use of ‘soft’ defences instead of high impact defences such as sea walls. Some cuspate <b>forelands</b> naturally do not contain any vegetation due to a high level of disturbance from physical factors such as wave action. However, with the frequency of storms arising from climate change, the effect on <b>forelands</b> and their associated vegetation needs to be effectively managed.|$|R
50|$|Cuspate <b>forelands,</b> {{also known}} as cuspate {{barriers}} or nesses in Britain, are geographical features found on coastlines and lakeshores that are created primarily by longshore drift. Formed by accretion and progradation of sand and shingle, they extend outwards from the shoreline in a triangular shape. Some cuspate <b>forelands</b> may be stabilised by vegetation, while others may migrate down the shoreline. Because some cuspate <b>forelands</b> provide an important habitat for many flora and fauna, effective management is required to reduce the impacts from both human activities and physical factors such as climate change and sea level rise.|$|R
50|$|The Lowland Fynbos and Renosterveld {{experiences}} regular winter rainfall, {{especially to}} the west of Cape Agulhas. The ecoregion has been subdivided into 9 areas: the West Coast <b>Forelands</b> from the Cape Flats to the Olifants River (Western Cape); the Warm Bokkeveld basin around the town of Ceres; the Elgin Valley around the town of Elgin; the sandy Agulhas Plain on the coast; the Breede River valley around the town of Worcester; the South Coast <b>Forelands</b> from Caledon west to Mossel Bay; the south-eastern end of the Little Karoo; Langkloof valley; and the Southeastern Coast <b>Forelands</b> west from Tsitsikamma to Port Elizabeth.|$|R
5|$|During his Spitsbergen {{visits with}} Prince Albert in 1898 and 1899, Bruce had {{detected}} {{the presence of}} coal, gypsum and possibly oil. In the summers of 1906 and 1907 he again accompanied the Prince to the archipelago, with {{the primary purpose of}} surveying and mapping Prince Charles <b>Foreland,</b> an island unvisited during the earlier voyages. Here Bruce found further deposits of coal, and indications of iron. On the basis of these finds, Bruce set up a mineral prospecting company, the Scottish Spitsbergen Syndicate, in July 1909.|$|E
5|$|The {{next big}} {{headland}} is <b>Foreland</b> Point, {{after which the}} path comes to Lynmouth with the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway linking it with Lynton on the hill above. At Lynmouth the path intersects with the Two Moors Way. The river here suffered a catastrophic flood in the 1950s. Beyond Lynton the path passes through the Valley of the Rocks, known for its herd of goats, then Duty Point and Lee Bay, then Crock Point and Woody Bay. After Highveer Rocks the path crosses the small River Heddon then skirts Trentishoe Down and Holdstone Down and climbs Great Hangman.|$|E
5|$|Polar {{bears are}} thought to have diverged from a {{population}} of brown bears, Ursus arctos, that became isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene or from the eastern part of Siberia, (from Kamchatka and the Kolym Peninsula). The oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000 to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles <b>Foreland</b> in 2004. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the polar bear diverged from the brown bear roughly 150,000 years ago. Further, some clades of brown bear, as assessed by their mtDNA, are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears, meaning that the polar bear might not be considered a species under some species concepts.|$|E

40|$|Primary {{succession}} {{is limited}} by both ecosystem development and plant dispersal, but {{the extent to which}} dispersal constrains succession over the long-term is unknown. We compared primary succession along two co-occurring arctic chronosequences with contrasting spatial scales: sorted circles that span a few meters and may have few dispersal constraints and glacial <b>forelands</b> that span several kilometers and may have greater dispersal constraints. Dispersal constraints slowed primary succession by centuries: plots were dominated by cryptogams after 20 years on circles but after 270 years on forelands; plots supported deciduous plants after 100 years on circles but after > 400 years on <b>forelands.</b> Our study provides century-scale evidence suggesting that dispersal limitations constrain the rate of primary succession in glacial <b>forelands...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Penokean Mountain Range {{formed in}} the Penokean orogeny 1880 to 1830 million years ago, when an oceanic island arc called the Pembine–Wausau terrane {{collided}} with the southern margin of the Superior craton. From 1880 to 1850 million years ago, the region was volcanically active. This volcanism ceased 1850 million years ago when a fragment of Archean crust arrived from the South at the subduction zone. Collision of this Archean crust in the south with the Superior craton in the North caused a period of intense crustal shortening. Rocks of the Pembine–Wassau terrane were thrust up over and onto the Superior craton, forming a mountain range that covered all but the northernmost portion of Lake Superior, crossed parts of three US states (south-central Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan), and continued to the southernmost tip of Ontario, Canada. Loading of the lithosphere by these thrust sheets caused it to flex downwards, forming a <b>foreland</b> basin at around 1850 million {{years ago in the}} south and 1835 million years ago in the north. The Rove Formation was deposited in the northern basin. In the southern basin, crustal thickening caused high-grade metamorphism of the sedimentary fill by 1830 million years ago. A series of post-orogenic plutons intruded into the overlying rocks 1830 million years ago,; these plutons mark the end of the Penokean orogeny.|$|E

Kober, developing geosyncline theory, posited that stable blocks known as <b>forelands</b> move toward each other, forcing the sediments of the intervening geosynclinal region to move over the <b>forelands,</b> forming marginal mountain ranges known as Randketten, while leaving an intervening median mass known as the Zwischengebirge.|$|R

40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{types of}} ports handle French deep-sea cargo: global ports of Northern Range and Marseilles serve {{a great number}} of overseas regions (<b>forelands)</b> and secondary ports mainly serve niche markets. In this paper we demonstrate that global ports serve also larger hinterlands, but their superiority over secondary ports depends on the types of cargo handled. The results of a spatial interaction model demonstrate that most of types of cargo flows are strongly distance-constrained. This evidence indicates that, despite a deep transformation on <b>forelands,</b> the secondary ports subsist because they partly depend on niche markets and local economies generating substantial amounts of non-containerised cargo flows. Some implications of this finding are suggested...|$|R
