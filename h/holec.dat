During the 1980s, the company, which was simply known as <b>Holec</b> Machines and Apparaten (<b>HOLEC),</b> was suffering from failing business due to downturns and changes in old industries, such as the shipbuilding industry.

Based on the last forty years of research on learner autonomy at the CRAPEL according to <b>Holec's</b> definition (1988), we designed a global VLE for researchers working on language learning autonomy, teachers with various degrees of practice and experience in self-directed learning, and language learners.

Cataloged from PDF version of dissertation. Includes bibliographical references (page 31 - 32). Learner autonomy is {{in the heart of}} CLT approach. It is one of the central issues of Communicative Language Teaching. According to <b>Holec’s</b> (1981) definition learner autonomy means “ability to take charge of one’s own learning”. Developing capacity for taking responsibility for one’s own learning is claimed to be beneficial to learning (Benson, 2001, p. 109). In fact, there is a belief that autonomous language learners are better language learners (Benson, 2001, p. 2). The goal of Communicative Language Teaching is to enable learners to communicate in the target language. “Learners use the target language a great deal through communicative activities such as language games, role play and problem-solving tasks” (Larsen-Freeman, 2000,p. 129). Activities of the CLT based classroom are designed to improve learner’s communicative competence. This study tries to find out which activities performed in CLT based classroom are believed to be most useful in promoting learner autonomy. Sabrina Anjum IslamM. A. in Englis...|$|R
40|$|Classroom-based, teacher-directed {{language}} learning has been dominant in language {{teaching and learning}} for decades; however, the notion of autonomy is not novel to language teachers. Since the publication of <b>Holec’s</b> book, Autonomy and Foreign Language Learning (1981), autonomy in {{language learning}} {{has been a significant}} issue for discussion in relation to language learning practices and language teaching principles. Many ESL researchers have turned their attention to learner autonomy in classroom settings; however, learner autonomy in the Iranian context within self-access settings, classroom settings, and school curriculum has not been adequately addressed in the literature. To fill the research gap mentioned above, the present study aims to determine: 1. if Betts’s Autonomous Learner Model (Betts & Kercher, 1999) has any significant effect in terms of students’ self-directed learning readiness, and 2. if Betts’s Autonomous Learner Model has any significant effect on students’ English language proficiency. Adopting a quasi-experimental design, the study involved a comparison between the experimental and the control group. Two instruments were used: Gugliemino’s (1977) Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS); and standardized TOEFL test. 30 students (group A) were taught English based on a pedagogical model, which blended Betts’s ALM with classroom instruction and 30 students (group B) were taught through a traditional teacher-directed method. Finally, after six months of treatment, TOEFL test and SDLRS test were administered as the post-test and the results were analyzed by means of SPSS software. The results showed that ALM can work with Iranian students as evidenced by generally average performance on SDLRS and TOEFL post-tests...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, Brown Boveri, already a {{geographically}} diversified company with successful operating subsidiaries in Italy, Germany, Norway, Austria, and the Balkans, suffered losses {{due to the}} devaluation of the French franc and the German mark.

In 1924 Brown Boveri devalued its capital by 30 percent to cover the losses it had incurred. In 1927 the agreement with Vickers ran out and was not renewed. Besides the arrangement Brown Boveri had had with this British firm,it also had a somewhat similar relationship with Netherlands-based N.V. Heemaf which lasted well into the early 1960s when the Heemaf led the creation of <b>Holec</b> (Holland Electric).|$|E
5000|$|Meottomyces {{is a small}} genus of {{relatively}} nondescript, fleshy, brown mushrooms related to Tubaria. In older classifications it had been included in Pholiota, Phaeogalera or Hemipholiota. Modern molecular evidence suggested recognition of a separate genus when sequences of a collection first identified as Pholiota oedipus, now reclassified in Meottomyces, revealed a unique branch. Subsequently, that species was studied by <b>Holec</b> [...] and later as Phaeogalera oedipus was shown to be distinct from Tubaria but {{not the type of}} Phaeogalera itself. Additional phylogenetic support was provided by Gitte Petersen and others, who clearly showed a separation from Phaeogalera. [...] The genus was erected by Vizzini for two species and two varieties, all former members of Pholiota. Vizzini treated the name Pholiota oedipus as a misapplied name, but this is contested by Legon who provided detailed notes on the types and ecology of the type species.|$|E

5000|$|Today's Slovak {{politicians}} — {{especially the}} members of the Slovak National Party — even though all perpetrators were Slovaks, interpret the event as [...] "Hungarian gendarmes shooting at innocent Slovaks" [...] (during the legal actions after the massacre, some gendarmes refused to testify as witnesses, because the victims were their relatives). With many of their claims regarding the events, the Slovak National Party continues to perpetuate a [...] "false myth of Černová". [...] Some Slovak sources claim that the gendarmes were ethnic Hungarian. even though there was {{a very small number of}} ethnic Hungarians in the region where the gendarmes were recruited. According to Slovak historian Roman <b>Holec,</b> professor at Comenius University in Bratislava, the majority of the gendarmes were Slovaks from Liptó county. (According to the official 1910 census, over 90% of the population were ethnic Slovaks in that county.) They were nevertheless honored for the deed, because they were in the service of Hungarian state. Both the rioters and the gendarmes can be held responsible for the massacre. The rioters were violent from lack of fear of getting shot (i.e. that the sergeant would refrain from giving an order of fire or use blanks). The gendarmes were shooting in all directions instead of aiming for feet or into the air (most victims died due to their head and chest injuries).|$|E
40|$|An ongoing action-research {{project at}} the CRAPEL has shown that {{students}} at a vocational high school near Nancy have engaged with more or less success in an out-of-school and out-of-curriculum Internet-based foreign language learning scheme (Bailly et al. 2008). The less successful students sometimes lack the necessary skills such as knowing how to choose keywords for a search on the Internet, or how to assess {{the quality of the}} learning resources they find. They are puzzled by contradictory in-formation or select unsuitable resources. Personal motivation and accessi-ble online resources are not sufficient conditions to make self-directed learning (<b>Holec</b> 1998) possible or easy for those students, whose learning process is oriented by the social promotion of teaching/heteronomy over learning/autonomy (as defined by <b>Holec</b> 1990; <b>Holec</b> 1991; Little 1991).
