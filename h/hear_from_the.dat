5|$|When {{the crowd}} finally reached Versailles, it {{was met by}} another group that had {{assembled}} from the surrounding area. Members of the Assembly greeted the marchers and invited Maillard into their hall, where he fulminated about the Flanders Regiment and the people's need for bread. As he spoke, the restless Parisians came pouring into the Assembly and sank exhausted on the deputies' benches. Hungry, fatigued, and bedraggled from the rain, they seemed {{to confirm that the}} siege was a simple demand for food. The unprotected deputies {{had no choice but to}} receive the marchers, who shouted down most of the speakers and demanded to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> popular reformist deputy Mirabeau. The great orator declined this chance at demagoguery but nonetheless mingled familiarly with the market women, even sitting for some time with one of them upon his knee. A few other deputies welcomed the marchers warmly, including Maximilien Robespierre who was still at that time a relatively obscure figure in politics. Robespierre gave strong words of support to the women and their plight, and his efforts were received appreciatively; his solicitations helped greatly to soften the crowd's hostility towards the Assembly.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{after he}} kidnapped her, Garrido forced Dugard into a shower with him. The {{first time he}} raped her, {{she was still in}} handcuffs, which she wore during her first week in captivity. During that period, Dugard's only human contact was Garrido, who {{sometimes}} brought her fast food and told her amusing stories. He provided a bucket for her to use to relieve herself. At one point, he provided her with a television, but she could not watch the news and was unaware of the publicized search for her. Almost {{a month and a half}} after her kidnapping, by Dugard's recollection, Garrido moved her to a larger room next door, where she was handcuffed to a bed. He explained that the [...] "demon angels" [...] let him take her and that she would help him with his sexual problems because society had ignored him. He went on methamphetamine binges he called [...] "runs", during which he would dress Dugard up and spend time with her cutting out figures from pornographic magazines.

These binges would end with him sobbing and apologizing to Dugard alternating with threats to sell her to people who would put her in a cage.|$|E

Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone called [...] "Black Widow" [...] a [...] "great song" [...] and praised its [...] "hypnotic chorus."

A writer for MuchMusic felt [...] "Black Widow" [...] was [...] "a killer collaboration", {{in the same vein}} as Azalea's fourth single [...] "Fancy" [...] which featured Charli XCX. MTV Buzzworthy's Nedeska Alexis placed the song in her list of the 4 Songs You Have To <b>Hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> album, and said Perry [...] "worked her magic on the track." [...] Lucy O'Brien of The Quietus called the track a [...] "call-and-response anthem." [...] Marie Claire journalist Lauren Valenti deemed the song [...] "deliciously wicked" [...] and [...] "nothing short of brilliant", and commended Ora's vocal delivery on the track's hook. A writer for Rap-Up called Azalea and Ora [...] "a deadly duo" [...] on the song. Saeed Saeed of The National highlighted [...] "Black Widow" [...] as a stand out track on The New Classic and praised its [...] "strong chorus and slithering beats." [...] Saeed's view was echoed by John Wiley of The Heights who listed the song as one of two highlights on the record. Writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, Craig Mathieson stated, [...] "while her verses don't have the sustained length of her previous underground releases, Azalea skillfully upsets convention." [...] Kyle Moody of the Marquette Wire preferred Azalea's sound [...] "Black Widow" [...] to the more rap-orientated songs on The New Classic. Laetitia Wong Wai Yi of Today felt the track attained well-deserved hype and commended it for [...] "perfectly" [...] combining Azalea's vocal fluidity with its minimalistic dance breakdown.

[...] The review goes on to point out that [...] "the reliance on the [...] "Jerk" [...] sound can be a little monotonous, there are enough variations along the way to keep things interesting." [...] He also says [...] "The duo's flow is not incredible but they spit convincingly. If you were looking for undisputedly pop-rap with a fresh sound and a light lyrical touch, the New Boyz debut is a fine destination." [...] XXL said that the album delivered [...] "unexpected lyrical talent" [...] but that it lacked [...] "sonic variety". The review also {{goes on to say that}} the album [...] "is no hip-hop classic, but rather the breath of fresh air rap needs." [...] Jeff Weiss of The Los Angeles Times gave the album three stars, commenting that the album [...] "is a catchy and charismatic debut that should engender pleasant teen nostalgia in anyone old enough to vote and help explain why for the last six months, the kids have been saying out with the old, in with the New Boyz.". The review also said that the album [...] "successfully strikes a balance between introducing a new sound (the minimalist bass-heavy bounce of jerk music) and style (skinny jeans, Vans and [...] "colors that ain’t even on the rainbow"), with traditional teenage themes (girls, the desire for self-expression, adults who don’t understand, girls). The result is a West Coast antidote to the South’s veritable monopoly on homeroom rap—a relentlessly breezy and fun ride through the lives of a pair of class clowns bent on enjoying the face cards that fate dealt." [...] The Selby Times said that the album [...] "is about as happening as it gets for teenage music with an attitude, even if it makes adults' eyes roll in disgust." [...] Wendy Roby of BBC said that, [...] "But overall their sheer chutzpah wins you over – and with its day-glo tongue wedged so very firmly in its cheek, Skinny Jeanz and a Mic is hard to resist." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the album [...] "one of the year’s most charming rap debuts, and certainly the least expected." [...] In a separate review, he named the album the sixth best album of the year, commenting, [...] "Emerging from Southern California’s jerk scene, this teenage duo made an album that’s appealingly young, simultaneously wide-eyed and knowingly lewd." [...] DJBooth.net's Nathan Slavik was less positive, predicting that the album would be [...] "the last time we <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> New Boyz." ...|$|E

2500|$|During Wilson's at-bat, Marty Barrett {{repeatedly}} {{yelled at}} Stanley from second for a throw as Knight was {{far off the}} bag and {{could easily have been}} picked off. [...] Stanley, however, could not <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> crowd noise and was focused on Wilson. [...] On the tenth pitch of the at-bat, with the momentum having already shifted to the Mets as the Red Sox were no longer {{on the verge of a}} championship, Stanley induced a ground ball off Wilson's bat. Buckner, who was playing on the lip of the infield to protect against a hit through the first-second base hole, moved over to the foul line to try to field the ball. He did not field it. [...] The ball rolled between his legs and into the outfield, enabling Knight to come around third and score without a play. The Mets won the game 6-5 and tied the series at three games. The win went to Aguilera, with the loss going to Schiraldi as he was responsible for Mitchell and Knight on base. Schiraldi was also credited with a blown save after giving up the tying runs in the eighth while Stanley was also credited with one for not holding the lead in the tenth.|$|E

2500|$|Kemp {{expressed}} that the a main {{motivation for the}} series was to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> soldiers who generally don't have a voice compared to other public workers. Kemp stated: [...] "I've got many friends {{who are in the}} services, but you never really hear a squaddie giving his point of view. I'd never heard one talk publicly and I wanted to hear that voice." [...] This would be the view of the young men being sent to the foreign climes of Afghanistan from a situation such as being 18 years old and still living at home with mum and dad, as opposed to hearing from officers trained in media relations. The series would examine the experiences of soldiers at home, injured soldiers and the families of serving soldiers. Kemp wanted to ascertain the motivation of the troops, their level of political knowledge about the situation, their views on Muslims. Kemp stated his opinion that the public gaining an understanding of what it's like for the soldiers is a good thing whatever anyone's political views on the war., informing the public what was happening out there and what the soldiers are doing for the people back home who are [...] "fortunate to live in a [...] country".|$|E
2500|$|The {{friend of}} Gene's mother {{was also an}} {{acquaintance}} of the alluring silent film star, Rubye De Remer, which gave Gene {{the opportunity to meet}} Rubye and make a marked impression on her as well. [...] On Gene's behalf, Rubye in turn piqued the interest of director Clarence Brown. [...] It was early 1945 when MGM and Clarence Brown first embarked on a nationwide casting search for some fresh talent for The Yearling [...] And now months later, Clarence believed that perhaps the role of Orry Baxter might be suited for Gene. [...] So Rubye contacted Gene the day after the Paramount offer was made and persuaded her to meet with Clarence at MGM that day. [...] Despite the fact that MGM newcomer, Jacqueline White, was actually selected and had filmed some scenes that summer, Clarence was still not convinced that she was the right choice. As a result, Gene was called back three times to test for the role and eagerly awaited to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> studio each time. This experience earned her a $250 a week, long-term MGM contract which she signed as herself, Gene Roberts. Ultimately, Gene's youthfulness was the deciding factor that prevented MGM from assigning her this lead role. [...] When production resumed in mid-September 1945, Clarence had chosen 28-year-old Jane Wyman, who was on loan from Warner Brothers, to portray a more mature-looking character with co-star Gregory Peck. [...] The Yearling was released in May 1947 and went on to win multiple Academy Awards and nominations, including a Best Actress nomination for Jane Wyman.|$|E
