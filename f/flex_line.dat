50|$|Sheik Khalid Al-Qasimi {{stated that}} the General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) of the United Arab Emirates has {{launched}} {{an investigation into the}} crash. It is reported that one area of inquiry is the engines. The Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Data Recorder were recovered and sent to the United Kingdom for analysis. In February 2010, it was reported that both recorders were not functioning, and no data was recovered from them. In January 2011, the GCAA released an interim report. An engine cowling fell away from the No. 4 engine shortly after take off. The final report stated the cause of the accident was the aircraft exceeding the maximum bank angle. This caused a stall and loss of control that was not recoverable. The crew were responding to a perceived power loss of engine #4, although their response was inappropriate. The #4 engines core cowls departed from the engine and this led to the separation of the Engine Pressure Ratio <b>flex</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

40|$|The project {{aimed to}} develop a {{protective}} and stabilizing insole called Trailplate for soft and light shoes. The demand came primarily from off-road runners in France, Switzerland, and Austria. The project was carried out at Icebug, a company that develops shoes mainly for rough terrain. The main {{focus has been on}} the trailplate which is designed to fit several different shoes. Torsional stiffness and bending resistance were the main objectives. To improve the existing insole, a material with the right features was required. The optimal design would meet the above functional requirements and provide comfort. Due to financial aspects sizing was also optimized. The results show that that the material of the insole must have a Young's modulus of at least 5 GPa to reduce deflection while maintaining a minimum thickness of 2 mm. The choice of material was also affected by costs and production aspects. While carbon was found to be a material with very desirable characteristics its high cost shifted to focus to hard plastic. The final recommendation for Icebug was Polyoxymethylene (POM) because it had the desired qualities with the added bonus of being cost effective. The final design included a flexible forefoot that follows the foots <b>flex</b> <b>line</b> (the metatarsal-phalangeal joint), ridges in the forefoot to prevent deflection, and a hole at the heel to increase the foots natural suppression. The product will help off-road runners in rocky terrain by offering support and protection for their feet...|$|E

40|$|Mechanically {{pumped fluid}} loops (MPFLs) are {{increasingly}} considered for spacecraft thermal control. A concern for long duration space missions is the leak of fluid leading to performance degradation or potential loop failure. An understanding of leak rate through analysis, {{as well as}} destructive and non-destructive testing, provides a verifiable means to quantify leak rates. The system can be appropriately designed to maintain safe operating pressures and temperatures throughout the mission. Two MPFLs on the Mars Science Laboratory Spacecraft, launched November 26, 2011, maintain the temperature of sensitive electronics and science instruments within a - 40 deg C to 50 deg C range during launch, cruise, and Mars surface operations. With over 100 meters of complex tubing, fittings, joints, <b>flex</b> <b>lines,</b> and pumps, the system must maintain a minimum pressure through all phases of the mission to provide appropriate performance.

40|$|Regolith {{is present}} on most {{planetary}} surfaces such as Earth's moon, Mars, and Asteroids. If human crews and robotic machinery are {{to operate on}} these regolith covered surfaces, they must face the consequences of interacting with regolith fines which consist of particles below 100 microns in diameter down to as small as submicron scale particles. Such fine dust will intrude into mechanisms and interfaces causing a variety of problems such as contamination of clean fluid lines, jamming of mechanisms and damaging connector seals and couplings. Since multiple elements must be assembled in space for system level functionality, it will be inevitable that interfaces will be necessary for structural connections, and to pass commodities such as cryogenic liquid propellants, purge and buffer gases, water, breathing air, pressurizing gases, heat exchange fluids, power and data. When fine regolith dust {{is present in the}} environment it can be lofted into interfaces where it can compromise the utility of the interface by preventing the connections from being successfully mated, or by inducing fluid leaks or degradation of power and data transmission. A dust tolerant, hand held "quick-disconnect" cryogenic fluids connector housing has been developed at NASA KSC which can be used by astronaut crews to connect <b>flex</b> <b>lines</b> that will transfer propellants and other useful fluids to the end user. In addition, a dust tolerant, automated, cryogenic fluid, multiple connector, power and data interface mechanism prototype has been developed, fabricated and demonstrated by NASA at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The design and operation of these prototypes are explained and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{advantage}} of cryocooler {{is the small}} size of its cold head due to this it can be mounted on top of a Dewar, thus reducing overall size of the liquefier setup making it possible to use it in demanding sites and laboratories where the consumption of liquid nitrogen is not in higher quantities. So the dewar which is mostly used to store liquid cryogen, here is used for production and storage purposes. A cryocooler based Nitrogen liquefaction system was designed and developed which can be an ideal solution to the liquid nitrogen usage in laboratories. This setup uses a Cryomech Single stage Gifford-Mcmahon cryocooler to provide cooling and condensation of nitrogen at 80 K with the refrigeration capacity of 266 W (Rated) at 80 K and a dewar specially fabricated with wider neck than usual dewar to accommodate cold head. The Gifford-Mcmahon cryocooler consist of compressor package, Helium <b>Flex</b> <b>lines</b> and cold head which is {{the heart and soul of}} this setup. The cold head is mounted into the top of the dewar and it extends down into the neck of the dewar for the purpose of cooling the nitrogen entering the dewar to 80 K (- 193 ºC) at 0. 5 bar gauge pressure which is the operating pressure for this dewar. The nitrogen gas liquefies on contact with the cold head heat exchanger. The liquefied nitrogen drips off the heat exchanger down into the dewar. This process would typically lower the pressure inside the dewar, but the regulator allows more nitrogen gas to enter the dewar to maintain the pressure at the preset level. The flow rate of the nitrogen gas into the dewar is controlled by the rate of liquefaction inside the dewar. In the experimental dewar maximum liquefaction rate of 74 Ltr/day and in the main dewar liquefaction rate of 64 Ltr/day were achieved. The difference in liquefaction rate was due to the high radiation load coming on cryogen reservoir of main dewar...|$|R

50|$|Energy {{concerns}} {{have had a}} large impact on automobile manufacturers. Fuel efficient hybrid vehicles such as the Chevrolet Tahoe, Saturn Vue, Toyota Prius, Toyota Camry Hybrid, Toyota Highlander Hybrid, Ford Escape Hybrid, Honda Insight and Honda Civic Hybrid have become available to Canadian consumers {{since the start of}} the 21st century and the rising cost of gasoline is making them increasingly attractive in spite of their generally higher cost. As of 2009, the Ford Fusion Hybrid was the most fuel efficient mid-sized car available in Canada. In 2008 Ford Canada began the operation of the <b>Flex</b> assembly <b>line,</b> using the <b>Flex</b> technique at its plant in Oakville, Ontario. This technology allows the production of three different automobile types, in this case, the Ford Edge, the Ford Flex and the Ford Lincoln MKX, on the same assembly line.

40|$|The {{spine of}} L 4 usually lies {{on a line}} drawn between the highest points of the iliac crests (Tuffier’s line) in adults. Although its {{accuracy}} has been questioned, it is still commonly used to identify the spinous process of the 4 th lumbar vertebra before performing lumbar neuraxial procedures. In children, this line is said to cross the midline {{at the level of}} L 5. A literature search revealed that the description this surface anatomical line is vague in neonates. The aims of this study were to determine the vertebral level of Tuffier’s line, as well as its distance from the apex of the sacrococcygeal membrane (ASM), in 39 neonatal cadavers in both a prone and flexed position. It was found that when <b>flexed,</b> Tuffier’s <b>line</b> shifted from the level of L 4 /L 5 (prone position) to the upper third of L 5. The mean distance from the ASM to Tuffier’s line was 23. 64 mm when prone and 25. 47 mm when flexed, constituting a statistically significant increase in the distance (p= 0. 0061). Therefore, in the absence of advanced imaging modalities, Tuffier’s line provides practitioners with a simple method of determining a level caudal to the termination of the spinal cord, at approximately the L 4 /L 5 in a prone neonate and the upper margins of L 5 when flexed.

40|$|The synthetic-aperture radar-interferometry {{technique}} {{is used to}} detect the migration of the limit of tidal <b>flexing,</b> or hinge <b>line,</b> of the floating ice tongue of Petermann Gletscher, a major outlet glacier of north Greenland. The hinge line is detected automatically from differential interferograms using a model-fitting technique based on an elastic-beam theory. The statistical noise of the model fit is less than 3 mm, and the hinge line is mapped with a precision of 30 m. Following automatic registration of multidate image data to a precision of 5 m, hinge-line migration is subsequently detected with a precision of 40 m in the horizontal plane across the glacier width. The {{results show that the}} hinge line of Petermann Gletscher migrates back and forth with tide by ± 70 m, in excellent agreement with the migration calculated from ocean tides predicted by a tidal model combined with the glacier surface and basal slope measured by an ice-sounding radar. Superimposed on the short-term hinge-line migration due to tide, we detect a hinge-line retreat of 270 m in 3. 87 years which varies across the glacier width by ± 120 m. The retreat suggests glacier thinning at a rate of 78 ± 35 cm ice a - 1. Coincidentally, an analysis of ice-volume fluxes indicates that the hinge-line ice flux of Petermann Gletscher exceeds its balance flux by 0. 88 ± 1 km 3 ice a - 1, which in turn implies glacier thinning at 83 ± 95 cm ice a - 1 in the glacier lower reaches. Both methods therefore suggest that Petermann Gletscher is currently losing mass to the ocean...|$|R
