The reason for this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> return to their lesser values when captured by an opponent whereas a captured gold gives the opponent a relatively more valuable piece.|$|E
25|$|As a result, widely varying principles, emphases, and {{definitions}} {{are used to}} determine local typologies among archaeologists working in the region. Attempts to identify and bridge the gaps made some headway at the Durham conference, though it was recognized that agreement on a single method of ceramic analysis or a single definition of a type may not be possible. The solution proposed by Dessel and Joffe is for all archaeologists {{in the field to}} provide more explicit descriptions of the objects that they study. The more information provided and shared between those in related sub-disciplines, the more likely it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> be able to identify and understand the commonalities in the different typological systems.|$|E

25|$|The core {{objective}} in {{training to be}} a solo diver is to become as self-sufficient and self-reliant as possible, {{to be able to}} deal with any reasonably foreseeable problems without assistance, and to have the competence, fitness, discipline, skills and equipment that will achieve this result. This requires competence at risk-assessment and the ability to plan dives and select equipment that limit the risks. An additional benefit of these disciplines <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> improve the safety of buddy diving whenever the competent solo diver pairs up with another diver in a buddy team by reducing the risk of the second diver being exposed to an emergency which they may not be capable of managing. Agencies training solo divers also recommend the self-sufficiency training in their courses for all divers as their diving experience grows, so as to achieve greater safety in all diving—buddy and solo.|$|E
25|$|His Holiness Sree Narayana Guru, {{the spiritual}} leader of the Thiyyas is {{reported}} to have disapproved of the present methods of Satyagraha at Vaikom. He suggests that volunteers should advance along barricaded roads and scale the barricades. They should enter temples and sit with others to dine. Now the action proposed is not Satyagraha. For scaling barricades is open violence. If you may scale barricades, why not break open temple doors and even pierce temple walls? How are the volunteers pierce through a row of policemen except by using force?. If the Thiyyas are strong and willing to die in sufficient numbers, they can gain their point. All I submit <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> have gained it by some thing the reverse of Satyagraha. And then too, they would not have converted the orthodox to their views, but would have imposed it on them by force.|$|E

2500|$|In the 4th India – England ODI in the 2008 series, {{the first}} innings was {{interrupted}} by rain on two occasions, resulting in the match being reduced to 22 overs each. India (batting first) made 166/4. England's target was set by the D/L method at 198 from 22 overs. As England knew they had only 22 overs the expectation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> be able to score more runs from those overs than India had from their (interrupted) innings. England made 178/8 from 22 overs, and so the match was listed as [...] "India won by 19 runs (D/L method)".|$|E
2500|$|It {{is quite}} common for members of a company to {{supplement}} the corporate constitution with additional arrangements, such as shareholders' agreements, whereby they agree to exercise their membership rights in a certain way. [...] Conceptually a shareholders' agreement fulfills {{many of the same}} functions as the corporate constitution, but because it is a contract, it will not normally bind new members of the company unless they accede to it somehow. [...] One benefit of shareholders' agreement <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> usually be confidential, as most jurisdictions do not require shareholders' agreements to be publicly filed. Another common method of supplementing the corporate constitution is by means of voting trusts, although these are relatively uncommon outside the United States and certain offshore jurisdictions.

2500|$|Recent {{research}} in developmental psychology {{suggests that the}} infant's ability to imitate others lies at the origins of both theory of mind and other social-cognitive achievements like perspective-taking and empathy. According to Meltzoff, the infant's innate understanding that others are [...] "like me" [...] allows it to recognize the equivalence between the physical and mental states apparent in others and those felt by the self. For example, the infant uses his own experiences, orienting his head/eyes toward an object of interest to understand the movements of others who turn toward an object, that <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> generally attend to objects of interest or significance. Some researchers in comparative disciplines have hesitated to put a too-ponderous weight on imitation as a critical precursor to advanced human social-cognitive skills like mentalizing and empathizing, especially if true imitation is no longer employed by adults. A test of imitation by Alexandra Horowitz found that adult subjects imitated an experimenter demonstrating a novel task far less closely than children did. Horowitz {{points out that the}} precise psychological state underlying imitation is unclear and cannot, by itself, be used to draw conclusions about the mental states of humans.|$|E
