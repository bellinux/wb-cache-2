This research employes purposive sampling technique. The data are 137 similes in the classic novel Wuthering Heights and their translations in Bahasa Indonesia. The analysis on the translation strategies shows the first translator, Lulu Wijaya, applied six strategies in translating the similes. The strategies are literal translation (117 <b>data),</b> replacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle with a different vehicle (6 <b>data),</b> reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simile (7 <b>data),</b> omission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simile (3 <b>data),</b> replacement <b>of</b> vehicle with a gloss (1 datum) and change of similarity features (3 data).
