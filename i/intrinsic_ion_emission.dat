Electrospray thrusters are promising thrusters built upon {{the state of the}} art in micro-technology and with flexible performance in terms of their high efficiency and high specific impulse. One challenge is to investigate in detail the mechanism for <b>ion</b> <b>emission</b> to complement experimental results and understand better how emission occurs in the micro to nano scale. Thus, atomistic modeling is used to understand properties of emitted charged particles which determine how the thrusters perform. As a preliminary study of <b>ion</b> <b>emission</b> from Taylor cones, ion evaporation from 3 - 5 nm droplets was observed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to validate the atomistic modeling and to investigate activation energies. <b>Ion</b> <b>emission</b> was examined in terms of internal and external electric fields and the activation energies of each case were obtained using Schottky's model and direct energy calculation to compare with experimental values. <b>Ion</b> <b>emission</b> was mainly observed with electric field strengths between 1. 2 - 2. 0 V/nm and the emitted species include both solvated and non-solvated ions. Propulsive properties from Taylor cones are examined using results from the analysis of electric current from <b>ion</b> <b>emission.</b> In addition to an observation of <b>ion</b> <b>emission</b> from liquid droplets, numerical simulations for interactions between a solid plate and liquid droplets were conducted with MD simulation.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{thermionic}} property of solids, the mean work function effective for positive ion from polycrystalline surfaces (ϕ+) is theoretically studied together with that for electron emission (ϕe). The theoretical values of ϕ+ and ϕe thus evaluated typically with W {{are in good}} agreement respectively with those experimental ones accepted today. The thermionic contrast (Δϕ* ≡ ϕ+ – ϕe) is determined to be 0. 56 – 0. 57 eV for W. For other polycrystalline metals (Nb, Mo, Ta, Re, Ir and Pt), it ranges from about 0. 4 to 0. 8 eV in contrast with monocrystalline ones having Δϕ* = 0.

We examined pores of radius 3. 4 - 6. 1 Å, and conducted molecular dynamics simulations to show that Na+, K+, and Cl- face different free energy barriers when entering hydrophobic pores. Most of the differences result from the different dehydration energies of the ions; however, changes in the solvation shell structure in the confined nanotube interior and van der Waals interactions in the small tubes can both play a role. Molecular dynamics simulations conducted under hydrostatic pressure show that carbon nanotube membranes can act as ion sieves, with the pore radius and pressure determining which ions will permeate through the membrane. This work suggests that the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>ion</b> selectivity of biological pores of differing radii might {{also play a role}} in determining their selectivity, in addition to the more common explanations based on electrostatic effects.

40|$|Here, {{we present}} the thermal {{behavior}} of polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) containing weak polyelectrolytes poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) as influenced by water content and complexation pH. Modulated {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (MDSC) reveals a glass-transition-like thermal transition (Ttr) that decreases in value with increasing hydration and with decreasing complexation pH. We show the collapse of all Ttr values into a single master curve when plotted against the ratio of water molecules per <b>intrinsic</b> (PAH+-PAA-) <b>ion</b> pair for all pH values explored. Remarkably, this master curve is linear when the natural log of the water to <b>intrinsic</b> <b>ion</b> pair ratio is plotted against the inverse of Ttr. This strongly indicates that the thermal transition is heavily influenced by water at the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>ion</b> pair site. Other water-solvent mixtures are also explored, for which Ttr appears to depend only on water content, regardless of the added solvent. These results suggest that water plays a dual role in PAH-PAA complex: first by participating in the hydrogen-bonding network within and second by plasticizing the PEC. A hypothesis for the thermal transition is proposed in which hydrated PECs undergo a two-step thermal transition caused by an initial restructuring of the water-polyelectrolyte hydrogen-bonding network, followed by chain relaxation.

40|$|Quasiequilibrium {{power flow}} in two radial magnetically {{insulated}} transmission lines (MITLs) coupled to a vacuum post-hole convolute is studied at 50 [*][*]TW– 200 [*][*]TW using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The key physical dimensions {{in the model}} {{are based on the}} ZR accelerator [D. [*]H. McDaniel, et al., Proceedings of 5 th International Conference on Dense Z-Pinches, edited by J. Davis (AIP, New York, 2002), p.   23]. The voltages assumed for this study result in electron emission from all cathode surfaces. Electrons emitted from the MITL cathodes upstream of the convolute cause a portion of the MITL current to be carried by an electron sheath. Under the simplifying assumptions made by the simulations, it is found that the transition from the two MITLs to the convolute results in the loss of most of the sheath current to anode structures. The loss is quantified as a function of radius and correlated with Poynting vector stream lines which would be followed by individual electrons. For a fixed MITL-convolute geometry, the current loss, defined to be the difference between the total (i. e. anode) current in the system upstream of the convolute and the current delivered to the load, increases with both operating voltage and load impedance. It is also found that in the absence of <b>ion</b> <b>emission,</b> the convolute is efficient when the load impedance is much less than the impedance of the two parallel MITLs. The effects of space-charge-limited (SCL) <b>ion</b> <b>emission</b> from anode surfaces are considered for several specific cases. <b>Ion</b> <b>emission</b> from anode surfaces in the convolute is found to increase the current loss by a factor of 2 – 3.
