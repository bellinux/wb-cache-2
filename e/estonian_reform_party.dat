25|$|In fall 2001 Arnold Rüütel {{became the}} President of the Republic of Estonia, and in January 2002 Prime Minister Laar stepped down. On 28 January 2002, the new {{government}} was formed from a coalition of the centre-right <b>Estonian</b> <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> and the more left wing Centre Party, with Siim Kallas from the Reform Party of Estonia as Prime Minister.|$|E

5000|$|The {{party is}} {{supported}} predominantly by young, well-educated, urban professionals. Unlike the Centre Party, which has disproportionate appeal amongst the Russian minority, and the Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica, which is overwhelmingly backed by ethnic <b>Estonians,</b> the <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> attracts votes from equally across populations. [...] The <b>Reform</b> <b>Party's</b> vote base is heavily focused in the cities; although it receives only one-fifth of its support from Tallinn, it receives {{three times as}} many votes from other cities, despite them being home to fewer than 40% more voters overall.|$|R
50|$|The Stop Common Core Party rechristened {{itself as}} the <b>Reform</b> <b>Party,</b> {{initially}} unrelated to the national <b>Reform</b> <b>Party,</b> on February 17, 2015.

25|$|The European Parliament {{election}} of 2009 in Estonia scored a 43.9% turnout – about 17.1% higher {{than during the}} previous election, and slightly above the European average of 42.94%. Six seats were up for taking in this election: {{two of them were}} won by the Estonian Centre Party. <b>Estonian</b> <b>Reform</b> <b>Party,</b> Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica, Social Democratic Party and an independent candidate Indrek Tarand (who gathered the support of 102,460 voters, only 1,046 votes less than the winner of the election) all won one seat each. The success of independent candidates has been attributed both to general disillusionment with major parties and the use of closed lists which rendered voters incapable of casting a vote for specific candidates in party lists.|$|E
25|$|Estonia {{today is}} mainly {{influenced}} by developments in Finland, Russia, Sweden and Germany – the four main trade partners. The government recently greatly increased its spending on innovation. The prime minister from the <b>Estonian</b> <b>Reform</b> <b>Party</b> has stated {{its goal of}} bringing Estonian GDP per capita into the top 5 of the EU by 2022. However, the GDP of Estonia decreased by 1.4% in the 2nd quarter of 2008, over 3% in the 3rd quarter of 2008, and over 9% in the 4th quarter of 2008. The Estonian economy further contracted by 15.1% {{in the first quarter}} of 2009. Low domestic and foreign demand have depressed the economy's overall output. The Estonian economy's 33.7% industrial production drop was the sharpest decrease in industrial production in the entire European Union.|$|E
