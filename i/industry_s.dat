The primary sequence of closed-loop strategies would imply {{to adapt the}} use matrix of a specific industry. Assuming that <b>industry</b> (<b>S)</b> would replace a primary product (P^') for a secondary material from a recycling activity (P^"), then the coefficients of the A^PS-matrix would decrease for the virgin materials (↓ for a^P's). Likewise, the direct requirements of S would rise for the input of secondary goods (↑ for a^P"s). A proportional exchange between P^' and P^" [...] can be expressed by monetary terms, if the prices of both products are fixed, {{as well as by}} direct substitution in physical units (Ferrer and Ayres 2000; Ferrão et al. 2014). Following the secondary sequence, we observe the adjustment of waste fractions treated by waste treatment industries (↑↓ in A^TW elements). Such an effect is considered because the replacement of P^' for P^" [...] could adapt as well the waste generated by <b>industry</b> <b>S,</b> and, then, changing direct requirements from waste treatment sectors in order to dispose the new fractions of waste.|$|E
