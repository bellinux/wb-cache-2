40|$|In {{the paper}} at hand we analyze the ‘enlarged <b>European</b> <b>audiovisual</b> market’. Hence, {{accession}} to the European Union (EU) not only resulted in harmonization of audiovisual legislation {{of the new}} Member States, but also in {{being part of the}} common <b>European</b> (<b>audiovisual)</b> market. By using the design of a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis we try to make an assessment: What does the enlarged audiovisual market looks like? What are its strengths and what are the weaknesses? What does the enlargement of the EU mean for Central and Eastern <b>European</b> <b>audiovisual</b> cultures? Does it offer opportunities or rather threats? The main characteristic – {{and at the same time}} the main weakness – of the <b>European</b> <b>audiovisual</b> market is its fragmentation into small national markets with only limited cross-border distribution. The EU enlargement seems to ‘enlarge’ this characteristic as the new countries of Central and Eastern Europe fit into this picture (with only Poland, and in second place Hungary and the Czech Republic as countries with sizeable markets). EU enlargement offers opportunities for Central and Eastern <b>European</b> <b>audiovisual</b> industries such as increased investments and funding, cooperation partners and enhanced export possibilities. The threat of Europeanization, however, adds to the already present threat of Americanization. It could be argued, though, that Europeanization as a process of ‘transnational cultural diffusion’ is not so evident – neither in Western Europe, Eastern Europe or enlarged Europe. Again, Eastern Europe ‘adds more of the same’. In both Western and Eastern Europe the audiovisual sector is considered to play not only a major economic but also an important cultural role. Audiovisual policy is considered an instrument to preserve the national and (in second instance) European culture. Eastern and Western Europe could feel united by this idea. status: publishe...|$|R
