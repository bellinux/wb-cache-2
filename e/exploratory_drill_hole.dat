40|$|A {{method was}} {{discussed}} for using 6 band thermal imagery to locate subsurface gravel deposits in vegetated areas. Geologic history is reviewed to select potential areas of study. An overflight was made using a thermal scanner. The data were processed with a computerized system to delineate areas showing a quartz signature radiated by a gravel deposit. The method was developed during {{a search for}} gravel on National Forest land in Louisiana. Processed data from thermal imagery was compared with known gravel deposits and <b>exploratory</b> <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> logs. A high correlation was noted {{for a wide range}} of deposits, from commercial pits to trace deposits only a foot thick.

40|$|Yucca Mountain in {{southern}} Nye County, Nevada, {{has been proposed}} as a potential site for the underground disposal of high-level nuclear waste. An <b>exploratory</b> <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> designated UE 25 p# 1 was drilled 3 km east of the proposed repository site to investigate the geology and hydrology of the rocks that underlie the Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rock sequence forming Yucca Mountain. Silurian dolomite assigned to the Roberts Mountain and Lone Mountain Formations was intersected below the Tertiary section between a depth of approximately 1244 m (4080 ft) and {{the bottom of the}} drill hole at 1807 m (5923 ft). These formations are part of an important regional carbonate aquifer in the deep ground-water system. Tertiary units deeper than 1139 m (3733 ft) in drill hole UE 25 p# 1 are stratigraphically older than any units previously penetrated by drill holes at Yucca Mountain. These units are, in ascending order, the tuff of Yucca Flat(?), an unnamed calcified ash-flow tuff, and a sequence of clastic deposits. The upper part of the Tertiary sequence in drill hole UE 25 p# 1 is similar to that found in other drill holes at Yucca Mountain. The Tertiary sequence is in fault contact with the Silurian rocks. This fault between Tertiary and Paleozoic rocks may correlate with the Fran Ridge fault, a steeply westward-dipping fault exposed approximately 0. 5 km east of the drill hole. Another fault intersects UE 25 p# 1 at 873 m (2863 ft), but its surface trace is concealed beneath the valley west of the Fran Ridge fault. The Paintbrush Canyon fault, the trace of which passes less than 100 m (330 ft) east of the drilling site, intersects drill hole UE 25 p# 1 at a depth of approximately 78 m (255 ft). The drill hole apparently intersected the west flank of a structural high of pre-Tertiary rocks, near {{the eastern edge of the}} Crater Flat structural depression...|$|E
40|$|Tunnel B of the Stage I Strategic Sewage Disposal Scheme (SSDS) has an {{excavated}} {{diameter of}} 3. 2 m {{and it was}} excavated with a hard rock tunnel boring machine 75 m below the Eastern Harbour Crossing Tunnel (EHC) in the Victoria Harbour of Hong Kong. The EHC is an immersed tube structure built in 1990 and the structure {{was made up of}} fifteen rectangular reinforced concrete box segments, each of about 125 m long, connected together by flexible joints that are under compression at working condition. The major risk that had been identified was that if any ground movement in the EHC tunnel boxes had occurred, as a result of groundwater drawdown due to large inflow into Tunnel B, the flexible joints connecting the two adjacent boxes of the structure could have lost its effectiveness in water-sealing, with the consequence of seawater entering the boxes under full hydrostatic pressure. The EHC is a major trunk road in Hong Kong and should water seeps into the structure, traffic would have been devastated resulting in huge financial loss to the city. To identify and to manage the risk of potential movement when Tunnel B was approaching under the EHC, site specific ground investigation comprising of a 800 m long horizontal <b>exploratory</b> <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> and geophysical survey had been carried out to identify the geological condition and groundwater regime ahead of the tunnel. The geophysical survey was specifically carried out to investigate any accretion of silt above the EHC box segments in order to properly model the correct boundary condition in a seepage analysis. Sensitivity analysis on the effect of different boundary conditions to settlement prediction using a full range of soil parameters has been considered. It is found from this study that the presence of a blanket of marine deposit (above the tunnel box segment) is an important factor that could increase the settlement prediction by many orders of magnitude as compared to the case without marine deposit. The marine deposit is a very low permeability material, which could act as a cap and retard or prevent the downward flow of the seawater from recharging into the system. The best estimate of ground settlement likely anticipated due to tunnelling was arrived, based on engineering judgment and experience consistent with other project studies. When Tunnel B was 600 m away from the EHC, additional probing and shortening of cuts were exercised; settlement and joint opening were continuously monitored on a bi-daily basis; and inflow into Tunnel B was measured daily. All of these measures were carried out in accordance with the risk management plan.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the data {{obtained}} from the Regional Mineral Reconnaissance of the Northumberland Trough, several areas were defined, largely {{on the basis of the}} total field magnetic data, for further investigation. Bateson and others (1983) have reported on the first phase of this work. The present report covers a further four areas. Soil geochemistry of each was examined in samples obtained from a regular grid together with ground magnetic measurements. In one area, Brown Moor, a programme of <b>exploratory</b> <b>drilling</b> (4 <b>holes)</b> was also undertaken. At Todridge Fell, Wheathill and Brown Moor the surface geochemical data indicate that faulting in the Whin Sill, is accompanied by mineralisation. The amount and type of such mineralisation is, however, not determinable except in the case of Brown Moor where the short drilling programme indicates alteration of the Whin accompanied by identifiable mineralisation particularly with respect to Mn, Ba and Pb. The work undertaken at Wesley resulted in the definition in soils of a linear zone enriched in Ba with associated higher than background values of Pb and En. A weak linear magnetic feature does not coincide with the surface geochemical "highs". The data cannot be used conclusively to determine the origin of these highs; mineralisation associated with a fault structure or a stratabound concentration are possible. As with the occurrences at Todridge and Wheathill, the source of the geochemical anomalies could only be determined by drilling. The work in these four areas, together with the &ta obtained at Newbrough (Bateson and others, 19831, indicates that in areas underlain by the Whin Sill magnetic methods can be used to identify fault structures affecting this basic body, with which alteration and mineralisation may be associated...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} locate the {{relatively}} optimum sites for <b>drilling</b> <b>exploratory</b> <b>holes</b> for fresh water, an electrical resistivity survey was conducted along the new Mahukona-Kawaihae Road on the west flank of the Kohala Mountain. Two resistivity soundings were run using the Schlumberger spread configuration to determine a satisfactory spacing for a Wenner profile spread. Using an "a" spacing of 275 feet, a profile of 209 stations was run using the Wenner spread configuration. The data were correlated with elevation at 0. 41, so a procedure for removing the elevation effect from observed apparent resistivity was developed. The procedure is probably uniquely applicable to insular environments. Based on the reduced resistivity profile, four relatively optimum sites for additional exploration, such as by drilling, are specified. There is not, however, any interpretation of the data that can definitely indicate the occurrence anywhere on the profile of large underground reservoirs of freshwater. This is because the interpretation of profile data is essentially relative, not absolute.

40|$|While <b>drilling</b> <b>holes</b> it is {{extremely}} important that the <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> are <b>drilled</b> as straight as possible. Even with the advances in drilling technology over the years it is still almost impossible. This is especially the case as the drilling depth increases. <b>Drill</b> <b>hole</b> deviation is affected {{by a variety of}} factors including drilling techniques such as weight on bit (WOB) or drill string diameter and rock properties such as density and crystal structure. It is important to study the deviation of the <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> to ensure that the borehole is aligned correctly. When there is deviation within a boreholes major negative consequences can occur. This thesis describes the results from deviation measurements of <b>drill</b> <b>holes</b> from two different drifts within the ore body ”Alliansen” in the LKAB mine in Malmberget (MUJ).
