5|$|Advertising {{coloration}} can {{signal the}} services an animal offers to other animals. These {{may be of}} the same species, as in sexual selection, or of different species, as in cleaning symbiosis. Signals, which often combine colour and movement, may be understood by many different species; for example, the cleaning stations of the banded coral shrimp Stenopus hispidus are visited by different species of fish, and <b>even</b> <b>by</b> reptiles such as hawksbill sea turtles.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's {{earnings}} from his offices {{had made him}} a wealthy man, <b>even</b> <b>by</b> the standards of his patrons. This wealth allowed him to purchase the Balcaskie estate in 1665, and to extend the house and gardens. In 1675 he purchased the larger estate of Loch Leven, Kinross, from the Earl of Morton, which brought him the hereditary sheriffdom of Kinross-shire. In the late 1670s Bruce took on his first architectural projects for entirely new houses.|$|E

5|$|By 2005 {{there were}} 1,172 primary schools, but levels of {{enrollment}} that were low <b>even</b> <b>by</b> African standards with only around 17–19% of schoolchildren in primary education.

5|$|During the {{confused}} fighting, French and Russian units moved forward into impenetrable smoke and were smashed by artillery and musketry fire that was horrendous <b>even</b> <b>by</b> Napoleonic standards. Infantry and cavalrymen had difficulty maneuvering over the heaps of corpses and masses of wounded.

5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>by</b> Sammarinese standards, {{qualification}} for the 1998 World Cup was disappointing.

Qualification for Euro 2000 again resulted in defeats in every game. The closest game was against Cyprus, a 1–0 defeat on 18 November 1998.|$|E

Soon after his elevation, Kalonji was publicly condemned and disavowed by ten of South Kasai's 13 representatives in the Léopoldville parliament, beginning the disintegration of the secessionist state.|$|E

5|$|The Bend {{remained}} an agricultural settlement for nearly 80 more years. <b>Even</b> <b>by</b> 1836, {{there were only}} 20 households in the community.

The Bend became an important transfer and rest station along the route. Over the next decade, lumbering and then shipbuilding would become important industries in the area.|$|E
5|$|The grapes exhibit {{an uneven}} pattern of ripening: a single bunch may contain both raisin-like, {{over-ripe}} grapes and green, unripened grapes.

This extensively laborious practice is one component in {{the high cost of}} some Zinfandels.|$|E

5|$|Adults {{and their}} young may be preyed upon by {{mammalian}} predators, {{such as the}} red fox (Vulpes vulpes) or the feral cat (Felis catus), and native predatory birds, such as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbird species (Cracticus spp.), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) and reptiles such as goannas. Another threat to the birds is from humans; many nests are trampled on (<b>even</b> <b>by</b> the occasional bird watcher) during breeding season because the nests are hidden {{close to the ground}} and therefore difficult for passers-by to spot.|$|E

5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are quick}} to bite if touched, captured, or otherwise provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations. Commercial fisheries for this species exist off Baja California {{and to a lesser}} extent off California (see below); the meat is considered excellent and is sold fresh or frozen. This species is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or <b>even</b> <b>by</b> hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of this species to withstand a focused fishing effort is limited, due to its low rates of reproduction and movement.|$|E
