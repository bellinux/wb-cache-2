Understanding the Planck relationship, which links energy and frequency {{as a result of}} quantification of the energy, is a crucial step. It {{is one of the most}} famous examples of the corpuscular nature of light, which led to the development of quantum mechanics in the early 20 th century, and whose explanation is still the standard in teaching Physics in high school. The paper also {{presents the}} verification of Einstein's theory and determination of Planck's constant using <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>phenomenon</b> for LEDs of different colours. Conceptual maps are a powerful tool not only for perceiving, representing and achieving knowledge, but also for creating new knowledge. It is essential helping students to understand that all concepts are somehow related to each other. Selecting cross-links as specific as possible and identifying the most appropriate linking words to connect concepts are crucial aims. CmapTools software tool can serve as a basis for a new kind of integration of Internet resources and all classroom experiences, inside Physics laboratories, and outside them. If it is used in conjunction with conceptual maps designed to support learning, it provides a new educational model...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the literature of solid-state lighting, based on a comprehensive dataset of 35, 851 English-language articles and 12, 420 U. S. patents published or issued during the years 1977 - 2004 in the foundational knowledge domain of <b>electroluminescent</b> materials and <b>phenomena.</b> The dataset was created using a complex, iteratively developed search string. The records in the dataset were then partitioned according to: whether they are articles or patents, their publication or issue date, their national or continental origin, whether the active electroluminescent material was inorganic or organic, and which of a number of emergent knowledge sub-domains they aggregate into on the basis of bibliographic coupling. From these partitionings, we performed a number of analyses, including: identification of knowledge sub-domains of historical and recent importance, and trends over time of the contributions of various nations and continents to the knowledge domain and its sub-domains. Among the key results: (1) The knowledge domain as a whole has been growing quickly: the average growth rates of the inorganic and organic knowledge sub-domains have been 8 %/yr and 25 %/yr, respectively, compared to average growth rates less than 5 %/yr for English-language articles and U. S. patents in other knowledge domains. The growth rate of the organic knowledge sub-domain is so high that its historical dominance by the inorganic knowledge sub-domain will, at current trajectories, be reversed in the coming decade. (2) Amongst nations, the U. S. is the largest contributor to the overall knowledge domain, but Japan is on a trajectory to become the largest contributor within the coming half-decade. Amongst continents, Asia became the largest contributor during the past half-decade, overwhelmingly so for the organic knowledge sub-domain. (3) The relative contributions to the article and patent datasets differ for the major continents: North America contributing relatively more patents, Europe contributing relatively more articles, and Asia contributing in a more balanced fashion. (4) For the article dataset, the nations that contribute most in quantity also contribute most in breadth, while the nations that contribute less in quantity concentrate their contributions in particular knowledge sub-domains. For the patent dataset, North America and Europe tend to contribute improvements in end-use applications (e. g., in sensing, phototherapy and communications), while Asia tends to contribute improvements at the materials and chip levels. (5) The knowledge sub-domains that emerge from aggregations based on bibliographic coupling are roughly organized, for articles, by the degree of localization of electrons and holes in the material or phenomenon of interest, and for patents, according to both their emphasis on chips, systems or applications, and their emphasis on organic or inorganic materials. (6) The six 'hottest' topics in the article dataset are: spintronics, AlGaN UV LEDs, nanowires, nanophosphors, polyfluorenes and electrophosphorescence. The nine 'hottest' topics in the patent dataset are: OLED encapsulation, active-matrix displays, multicolor OLEDs, thermal transfer for OLED fabrication, ink-jet printed OLEDs, phosphor-converted LEDs, ornamental LED packages, photocuring and phototherapy, and LED retrofitting lamps. A significant caution in interpreting these results is that they are based on English-language articles and U. S. patents, and hence will tend to over-represent the strength of English-speaking nations (particularly the U. S.), and under-represent the strength of non-English-speaking nations (particularly China) ...|$|R
