5000|$|The {{station was}} {{automated}} on 7 January 1959 and the dioptric lens with its revolving machine and vaporised paraffin incandescent burner {{were replaced by}} a new fourth order cylindric refractor lens. Its mantle light source used <b>dissolved</b> <b>acetylene</b> from a battery of cylinders giving a candlepower of 2,600 white light and 500 in the red sector. This appeared to be worse than the old light and mariners using the harbour complained about the new lens.|$|E
50|$|It {{represents}} {{companies that}} make, supply or distribute industrial {{gases in the}} UK, or sell related compression equipment. Use of these gases can be very dangerous due to the low temperatures of the products, and high pressures of the gas when released, and hence the organisation is involved in regulation and laws for use of compressed gases. Compressed hydrocarbon gases (liquefied petroleum gas and <b>dissolved</b> <b>acetylene)</b> also have the danger of exploding, due to the high flammability of the gases.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 500 (of which 140 are lighted) River Marks and Buoys are {{maintained}} by the KoPT. These are extremely useful in facilitating night navigation, pilotage and dredging. These lights are operated either by grid electricity, by battery or by <b>dissolved</b> Marine <b>Acetylene</b> Gas. There is also 1 boat buoy, 30 lighted buoys and 72 unlit buoys marking the navigational channel from Sandheads to Kolkata.|$|R
40|$|The {{acetylene}} reduction assay for {{the measurement}} of N 2 fixation in a water-saturated paddy soil {{is limited by the}} slow diffusion of acetylene and ethylene. In laboratory incubation tests, vigorous shaking after the assay period is needed to release ethylene into the gas within the assay vials. Shaking prior to the incubation is also effective for <b>dissolving</b> <b>acetylene</b> in the water-saturated soil. However, a water-saturated soil depth of less than 10 mm during incubation is recommended. In field assays, some amounts of ethylene remain in the water-saturated soil phase of the acetylene reduction assay chamber, but stirring the water-saturated soil before sampling reduces the amount of ethylene remaining in soil. Evidence of a downward movement of acetylene and an upward movement of ethylene through rice plants was obtained. Because of the rapid transfer of acetylene to rice plant roots, an in situ acetylene reduction assay covering a rice hill is likely to detect nitrogen fixation in the proximity of roots where acetylene is easily accessible. Acetylene introduction to the water-saturated soil phase prior to assay did not greatly increase the acetylene reduction rate. Carbon dioxide enrichment in the assay chamber did not enhance nitrogen fixation in a paddy including rice and algae during a 1 -day cycle...|$|R
50|$|Georges Claude {{studied at}} the École supérieure de {{physique}} et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris (ESPCI). He then held several positions. He was an electrical inspector in a cable factory and the laboratory manager in an electric works. He founded and edited a magazine, L'Étincelle Électrique (The Electric Spark); his important friendship with Jacques-Arsène d'Arsonval apparently dates from this time. About 1896, Claude learned of the explosion risk for bottled acetylene, which was used at the time for lighting. Acetylene is explosive when stored under pressure. Claude showed that <b>acetylene</b> <b>dissolved</b> well in acetone, equivalent to storing it under 25 atmospheres of pressure, reduced the risk in handling the gas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{is situated}} on a hillock. There are 70 masonry steps {{to reach the}} tower. The Lighthouse is an unattended station. A rain water tank and a rest room have been provided for the maintenance staff.A third order revolving optic, on a mercury trough with DA (<b>dissolved</b> <b>acetylene)</b> gas burner and gas motor to revolve the optic, all supplied by M/s BBT, Paris were installed inside the lantern house over the CI tower [...] The light was commissioned on 14 April 1969. Due to frequent failures of the rotation system, the revolving optic assembly was removed and a 500 mm cut-and-polished drum optic was placed in position in 1978. The DA gas burner {{was replaced by a}} DA gas flasher with sun valve. This reduced the consumption of DA gas but the intensity of the light went down.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report a newly {{developed}} technique - laser calorimetry spectroscopy (LCS), {{which is a}} combination of laser absorption spectroscopy and calorimetry - for the detection of gases dissolved in liquids. The technique involves determination of concentration of a dissolved gas by irradiating the liquid with light of a wavelength where the gas absorbs, and measuring the temperature change caused by the absorbance. Conventionally, detection of dissolved gases with sufficient sensitivity and specificity was done by first extracting the gases from the liquid and then analyzing the gases using techniques such as gas chromatography. Using LCS, {{we have been able to}} detect ppm levels of dissolved gases without extracting them from the liquid. In this paper, we show the detection of <b>dissolved</b> <b>acetylene</b> in transformer oil in the mid infrared (MIR) wavelength (3021 nm) region...|$|E
40|$|The Musi River {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} river of twelve big rivers in South Sumatra Province. Water quality of this river affects the water quality in the estuary and {{biological}} health in its surrounding so that it is important to determine the Cu and Pb concentrations. The purposes of this study were to analize distribution of heavy metals (Cu and Pb) and to determine the water quality status in March and September 2014. The water and sediment samples were collected from eight stations along the Musi River from downstream to the estuary. Heavy metal concentration was analized by employing USEPA 30050 B method using AAS Spektra plus variant with air mixure flame – <b>acetylene.</b> <b>Dissolved</b> Cu and Pb concentrations in March were 0, 002 - 0, 006 mg/l and 0, 002 - 0, 003 mg/l, respectively, while in September were 0, 001 - 0, 010 mg/lfor Cu and 0, 001 - 0, 005 mg/lfor Pb. Cu and Pb concentrations in sediment detected in March were 6, 92 - 16, 4 mg/l and 1, 9 - 11, 4 mg/l, respectively, while in September were 2, 3 - 13, 9 mg/l for Cu and 4, 29 - 9, 95 mg/l for Pb. Student test analysis showed that was no significant differences between Pb and Cu concentrations (dissolved and sediment) between March and September. Generally, the concentration of heavy metals Cu and Pb in Musi River estuary were still below specified quality standards...|$|R
40|$|There {{is great}} demand for thin {{functional}} coatings in the semiconductor, optics, electronics, medical, automotive and aerospace industries [1 - 13]. As fabricated components become {{smaller and more}} complex, {{the properties of the}} materials’ surface take on greater importance. Thin coatings {{play a key role in}} tailoring surfaces to give them the desired hardness, wear resistance, chemical inertness, and electrical characteristics. Diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings possess an array of desirable properties, including outstanding abrasion and wear resistance, chemical inertness, hardness, a low coefficient of friction and exceptionally high dielectric strength [14 - 22]. Diamond-like carbon is considered to be an amorphous material, containing a mixture of sp 2 and sp 3 bonded carbon. Based on the percentage of sp 3 carbon and the hydrogen content, four different types of DLC coatings have been identified: tetrahedral carbon (ta-C), hydrogenated amorphous carbon (a-C:H) hard, a-C:H soft, and hydrogenated tetrahedral carbon (ta-C:H) [20, 24, 25]. Possessing the highest hardness of 80 GPa, ta-C possesses an sp 3 carbon content of 80 to 88 u%, and no appreciable hydrogen content whereas a-C:H soft possesses a hardness of less than 10 GPa, contains an sp 3 carbon content of 60 % and a hydrogen content between 30 to 50 %. Methods used to deposit DLC coatings include ion beam deposition, cathodic arc spray, pulsed laser ablation, argon ion sputtering, and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition [73 - 83]. Researchers contend that several advantages exist when depositing DLC coatings in a low-pressure environment. For example, ion beam processes are widely utilized since the ion bombardment is thought to promote denser sp 3 -bonded carbon networks. Other processes, such as sputtering, are better suited for coating large parts [29, 30, 44]. However, the deposition of DLC in a vacuum system has several disadvantages, including high equipment cost and restrictions on the size and shape of material that may be treated. The deposition of DLC at atmospheric pressure has been demonstrated by several researchers. Izake, et al [53] and Novikov and Dymont [54] have demonstrated an electrochemical process that is carried out with organic compounds such as methanol and <b>acetylene</b> <b>dissolved</b> in ammonia. This process requires that the substrates be immersed in the liquid [53 - 54]. The atmospheric pressure deposition of DLC was also demonstrated by Kulik, et al. utilizing a plasma torch. However, this process requires operating temperatures in excess of 800 oC [55]. In this report, we investigate the deposition of diamond-like carbon films using a low temperature, atmospheric pressure plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process. The films were characterized by solid-state carbon- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13 C NMR) and found to have a ratio of sp 2 to sp 3 carbon of 43 to 57 %. The films were also tested for adhesion, coefficient of friction, and dielectric strength...|$|R
