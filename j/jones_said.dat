5|$|Development of {{the film}} was {{announced}} on 20 December 2008, although writer Alex Garland had begun working on the script in 2006. British studio DNA Films produced the film, and partnered with sales agency IM Global to sell the worldwide distribution rights. By May 2010, this partnership saw IM Global and its owner Reliance Big Pictures agree to co-finance the 3-D project with a $45 million production budget, and a schedule to begin filming in Johannesburg, South Africa in late 2010. Pete Travis was named as the film's director and Garland, Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich would produce it. Duncan Jones had previously been offered the role of director. In a 2010 interview, <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> that his vision for the film was unconventional—describing it as weird, dark, and funny—and it did not mesh well with Garland's script. In September 2010, {{it was reported that}} the film would be titled Dredd.|$|E
5|$|After {{six games}} without a goal and some {{criticism}} from supporters, manager Pulis revealed that Jones has had personal problems which have affected his performances. He ended this {{run with a}} goal against Everton on New Year's Day. However, he again went on a goal drought this time for three months before scoring against Tottenham Hotspur in April. He then went on a similar scoring run he had {{at the start of}} the season scoring against Bolton Wanderers at Wembley, Aston Villa, Wolverhampton Wanderers and then had an opportunity to become the first Stoke player to score in four consecutive Premier League matches against Blackpool but he missed an open goal. He made amends the following match scoring against Arsenal in a 3–1 win. Jones played in the 2011 FA Cup Final as Stoke lost 1–0 to Manchester City, he had Stoke's best chance in the match going through one on one with Joe Hart who saved Jones' effort. Jones ended the 2010–11 as joint top goalscorer with Jonathan Walters, both scored 12 goals. <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> that he had a 'topsy-turvy' first season at Stoke.|$|E

6000|$|<b>JONES.</b> And I <b>said</b> to you, [...] "I'm a bloomin' Conservative," [...] I said; an' {{you said}} to me, [...] "You look more like one of these 'ere Socialists. Take wotever you like," [...] you said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, JONES," [...] I answered, sobbing, [...] "My wooing's at an end, [...] I couldn't {{think of}} robbing [...] My best, my only friend. [...] The notion makes me furious-- [...] I'd much prefer to die." [...] "Perhaps you'll think it curious," [...] <b>Said</b> <b>JONES,</b> [...] "but so should I." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{results of}} the NTV Telelink poll led former Liberal provincial and federal cabinet {{minister}} John Efford to criticize <b>Jones's</b> leadership. Efford <b>said</b> that Jones would not become premier and while he did not call on her to resign as leader, {{he did say that}} [...] "it's clear what she ought to do in the face of poor polling results".|$|R
25|$|Peter Borish was second-in-command to Jones at Tudor Investment Corporation. <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> Borish {{anticipated}} the crash in 1987 because Borish had mapped the 1987 market against the market preceding the 1929 crash, and noted {{the similarity between}} the two markets.|$|E
25|$|The Temple's {{religious}} message transitioned {{during this}} period, to one treading between atheism and the subtle notion that Jones was a Christ-like figure. While Temple aides complained privately, <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> {{that the new}} message was needed to foster members' dedication to the Temple's larger goals. Jones maintained such implications until the mid-to-late 1970s.|$|E
25|$|In the post-fight {{interview}} with ESPN's Brian Kenny, <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> {{that he would}} like to fight again. He would welcome a fourth bout with Tarver or another duel with Johnson. The fighters earned in excess of $4 million apiece plus a share of pay-per-view revenues, with the fight generating 440,000 pay-per-view buys.|$|E
5000|$|Foreign Minister Bob Carr <b>said</b> <b>Jones's</b> {{comments}} were indecent {{and the public}} reaction was justifiable. Senator Carr further said [...] "I cannot {{believe that it is}} helpful for a commercial enterprise to live with the brand 'hate radio'. And I just think the vehemence and the virulence of the message that comes out of the radio station is a very unhelpful thing for Australia.|$|R
5000|$|Ieuan Wyn Jones {{was born}} in Denbigh, Wales, and is a Welsh speaker. He has lived in both north and south Wales. Jones's early {{education}} was at Pontardawe Grammar School and at Ysgol y Berwyn in Bala, Gwynedd. <b>Jones's</b> brother Rhisiart <b>said</b> [...] "The time we spent living in Garnswllt (between Ammanford, in Carmarthenshire, and Pontarddulais, in Swansea) was a very happy time for us as a family," [...] adding [...] "Many people think that Ieuan is just a 'gog' but parts of south Wales {{are very close to}} his heart." ...|$|R
5000|$|Opposition member Malcolm Turnbull <b>said</b> <b>Jones's</b> {{remarks were}} [...] "cruel and offensive" [...] and that [...] "he should apologise to the PM and her family". He {{described}} {{the power of}} the social media campaign that caused sponsors to act as [...] "both inspiring and horrifying" [...] and said Jones has got [...] "a dose of his own medicine". Turnbull further said that Jones had not been the victim of cyberbullying as Jones claimed but new media had allowed thousands of Australians to speak up [...] "unedited and unmediated".|$|R
25|$|<b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> she {{had some}} {{conscious}} memories of her involvement in the mind-control program: it began in 1960, she said, when an old USO acquaintance (an unnamed retired army general) asked to use Jones' modeling school as a mailing address to receive some letters and packages. Jones agreed, she said, {{out of a sense}} of patriotism.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, NSW State Coroner Mary Jerram {{considered}} referring Jones and The Daily Telegraph to the NSW Supreme Court {{for comments}} about the inquest into the death of Private Jake Kovco. <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> that assisting counsel John Agius had tried to persuade Kovco's mother into refusing a jury inquest, comments which Jerram said could prejudice the inquest. No charges were brought against Jones.|$|E
25|$|Candy Jones {{was born}} to a well-off family. Jones {{reported}} vivid, conscious memories of physical abuse by her parents, {{and that she had}} vague memories of sexual abuse in her youth.

As a child, <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> she had an imaginary friend named Arlene to help through her lonely episodes.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the start}} of the Civil War the 6th Massachusetts (Militia) was ordered into active service for the defense of Washington in April 1861. As it marched to the relief of the capitol, it was {{attacked}} by a pro-southern mob in Baltimore (Pratt Street Riot). The regiment fought its way through, leaving four of its own dead {{on the streets of the}} city. On their arrival in Washington, they were greeted by President Lincoln, who shook Colonel <b>Jones's</b> hand and <b>said,</b> [...] "Thank God, you have come." [...] They slept that night in the Capitol building. The 6th Massachusetts was the first armed and trained regiment to arrive in Washington.|$|R
500|$|Stephanie Maslansky {{returned}} as the costume designer for Jessica Jones from Daredevil, and was assisted {{on the first}} episode by Jenn Rogien, who crafted Jessica Jones' leather jacket, faded jeans, and boots costume. On <b>Jones's</b> costume, Maslansky <b>said</b> she [...] "considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy. It keeps her from {{having to deal with}} the rest of humanity in a certain sort of way." [...] At least 10 versions of Jones's jacket were made, which started as an Acne Studios leather motorcycle jacket that had any [...] "bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details" [...] removed. 20 pairs of jeans were used, with both sets of clothing being aged and distressed.|$|R
25|$|Speaking {{through a}} surrogate, Obama called for Blagojevich's {{resignation}} on December 10. Had Blagojevich resigned or {{been removed from}} office before making the appointment, the duty would have fallen to Illinois Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn, who would succeed Blagojevich as governor. However, Illinois Senate president Emil <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> that he would call the Senate back into session to write {{a law that would}} result in Obama's replacement being determined in a special election.|$|E
25|$|On Wednesday, November 19, 2008, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> the {{suspended}} cornerback would be reinstated by commissioner Roger Goodell, {{but he would}} miss two more games — Sunday, November 23, 2008 and the following game on Thanksgiving, November 27, 2008.

A few months following their work together, Jones ran into Strummer at an event and asked him what he intended to do with those songs. Strummer informed Jones {{that they were going to}} be used for the next Clash record.|$|E
25|$|As a {{party to}} the {{original}} litigation, she sought to reopen the case in U.S. District Court in Texas to have Roe v. Wade overturned. However, the Fifth Circuit decided that her case was moot, in McCorvey v. Hill. In a concurring opinion, Judge Edith Jones agreed that McCorvey was raising legitimate questions about emotional and other harm suffered by women who have had abortions, about increased resources available for the care of unwanted children, and about new scientific understanding of fetal development, but <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> she was compelled to agree that the case was moot. On February 22, 2005, the Supreme Court refused to grant a writ of certiorari, and McCorvey's appeal ended.|$|E
25|$|In October 2013, it was {{reported}} by the BBC and The Hollywood Reporter that Jones planned to litigate against the estate of Michael Jackson for 10 million dollars. <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> that MJJ Productions, a song company managed by the singer's estate and Sony Music Entertainment, improperly re-edited songs to deprive him of royalties and production fees; further, they breached an agreement giving him the right to remix master recordings for albums released after Jackson's death in 2009. The songs Quincy produced for Jackson {{were used in the}} film, This Is It. Jones {{was reported}} to be filing the said lawsuits against the works of Michael Jackson Cirque du Soleil productions, and the 25th anniversary edition of the Bad album. Quincy believed he should have received a producer credit in the film.|$|E

500|$|In an October 2013 {{interview}} with BBC 6Music, Jones confirmed that Strummer did have intentions of a Clash reunion {{and in fact}} new music was being written for a possible album. In the months prior to Strummer's death, Jones and Strummer began working on new music for what he thought {{would be the next}} Mescaleros album. <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> [...] "We wrote a batch – we didn't use to write one, we used to write a batch at a time – like gumbo. The idea was {{he was going to go}} into the studio with the Mescaleros during the day and then send them all home. I'd come in all night and we'd all work all night." [...] <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> months had passed following their work together when he ran into Strummer at an event. Jones was curious as to what would become of the songs he and Strummer were working on and Strummer informed him that they were going to be used for the next Clash album.|$|E
500|$|Two {{writers in}} the 19th century {{described}} the old church. [...] The antiquarian Angharad Llwyd described it (before the 1839 building work) as [...] "a neat small edifice, and appropriately fitted-up". Writing in 1846, after some rebuilding, Longueville <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> that the east window was [...] "one of the purest models, as to proportion and workmanship", in Anglesey, and noted the [...] "richly sculptured compartments" [...] of the font.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1847, the clergyman and {{antiquarian}} Harry Longueville <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> that St Mary's, {{which he}} called [...] "a rather long and low building", was situated [...] "in an uneven, rocky, and exposed locality" [...] within a parish that had a [...] "peculiarly bleak and desolate appearance". He also thought that {{the roof of the}} church was [...] "remarkable for the quantity of good, but light, timber used in its construction." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1862, the clergyman and {{antiquarian}} Harry Longueville <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> {{that it was}} [...] "one of {{the largest}} churches in this division of Anglesey" [...] He said that it had recently been [...] "judiciously repaired and restored" [...] by James Williams and was [...] "now {{one of the best}} specimens of an old parish church in the island", adding that the east window was [...] "good in detail and in execution".|$|E
500|$|Angharad Llwyd {{described}} {{the church in}} 1833 as [...] "a lofty but small edifice", adding that several parts [...] "display marks of very great antiquity." [...] Harry Longueville <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> that its size made it [...] "one of the least considerable" [...] of the churches in Anglesey. The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in July 1873. [...] He {{said that it was}} a small church with [...] "some small rude windows".|$|E
500|$|Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rashida <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> {{she liked}} the new storylines that had {{developed}} for Ann Perkins' character, preferring that she remain single than simply get back together with Chris. According to Nielsen Media Research, [...] "Camping" [...] was seen by 5.15 million household viewers, a 39 percent increase from the previous episode, [...] "Harvest Festival". The episode received generally positive reviews, with several commentators praising Jones' performance and the new direction her character was taking.|$|E
500|$|Several {{commentators}} have rated Kelly the best accompanist in jazz, including critic Ray Comiskey and music educator Mark Levine. Drummer Philly Joe <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> that, as an accompanist, Kelly [...] "puts down flowers behind a soloist. He {{never wanted to}} steal in. He just put together the right things." [...] Pianist Bruce Barth pointed out that part of Kelly's success as an accompanist came from [...] "occasional and compelling use of 'blues licks' and melodic phrases in place of chords." ...|$|E
500|$|Jones {{announced}} on 8 April 2008 on Blue Peter that after three and half {{years with the}} show, he would be leaving {{at the end of}} the current series in June. His spokeswoman said he had always planned to leave when he turned 30. <b>Jones</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I've had a career on Blue Peter that you wouldn't even dream about and for that I feel privileged and fortunate. ... I've loved it, lived it ... and now I feel the time is right to leave it." ...|$|E
500|$|Samuel Lewis {{said that}} the new church was [...] "a plain {{structure}} in the old English style, with strong buttresses, which have a good effect, being so well suited to the exposed situation of the building." [...] Writing in 1846, the priest and antiquarian Harry Longueville <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> that the church, [...] "a modern erection of the Pseudo-Norman style", stood in [...] "a highly picturesque situation." [...] He {{said that the}} cross at {{the east end of}} the roof came from the old church.|$|E
500|$|In a 3 September 2013 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Mick Jones discussed the band reuniting saying it {{likely would have}} never happened. <b>Jones</b> <b>said</b> [...] "There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band". Jones also stated that the Sound System box set was the last time he will ever be involved in the band's releases. [...] "I'm not even thinking about any more Clash releases. This is it for me, and I say that with an exclamation mark." [...] <b>Jones</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
