2500|$|The American Civil War was {{followed}} by a boom in railroad construction. [...] of new track were laid across the country between 1868 and 1873. Much of the craze in railroad investment was driven by government land <b>grants</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> to the railroads. At that time, the railroad industry was the nation's largest employer outside of agriculture, and it involved large amounts of money and risk. A large infusion of cash from speculators caused abnormal growth in the industry as well as overbuilding of docks, factories and ancillary facilities. At the same time, too much capital was involved in projects offering no immediate or early returns.|$|E

Powell used the financial year of 1968–9 to show how income tax could be halved from 8s 3d to 4s 3d in the pound (basic rate cut from 41% to 21%) and how capital gains tax and Selective Employment Tax could be abolished without reducing expenditure on defence or the social services. These tax reductions required a saving of £2,855 million, {{and this would be}} funded by eradicating losses in the nationalised industries and denationalising the profit-making state concerns; ending all housing subsidies except for those who could not afford their own housing; ending all foreign aid; ending all <b>grants</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidies</b> in agriculture; ending all assistance to development areas; ending all investment grants; and abolishing the National Economic Development Council and the Prices and Incomes Board. The cuts in taxation would also allow the state to borrow from the public to spend on capital projects such as hospitals and roads and spend on [...] "the firm and humane treatment of criminals".|$|E

40|$|Regulators {{have been}} {{concerned}} {{with the impact of}} environmental regulation on the profitability of regulated firms: there have been numerous <b>grants</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidy</b> programs to reduce the cost of emission control equipment. Intuitively, there should be a monotonically increasing relationship between profits and the amount of subsidization. However, the author shows that this may not be so since regulation may establish a collusive outcome amongst oligopolistic competitors. The role of the subsidization policy may then be seen as the following: given Cournot players, the regulator may subsidize the emission control device to prevent the industry from reaching a profit superior outcome.

30|$|Two more counterarguments {{not present}} in the {{literature}} are worth considering: first, one potential danger of creating a citizens’ income is that it might in the future again be complemented by other, less efficient ways of rent circulation. This is why the simultaneous implementation of cash <b>grants</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidy</b> <b>and</b> public employment reforms is crucial, and why public awareness of this quid pro quo needs to be built before any reforms. It might be difficult to prevent inefficient patronage from seeping back into the system later on—but the expansion of distortive forms of wealth sharing {{would be even more}} likely under a continuation of the status quo scenario. A citizens’ income would guarantee {{that at least some of}} the government’s distributional spending is minimally distortive. A citizens’ income would also allow a much clearer and more effective government position to ward off demands for future mass patronage than is possible under the current distributional setup.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} the mapping of crime {{in the capital city}} of Prague in 2014 and its impact on economy of stakeholders. The theoretical part defines the concept of crime, describes factors which increase the probability of occurrence and development of crime and its economic consequences. In addition to this, some important theories dealing with crime and methods by which crime is reported are mentioned. Considerable attention is paid to the security situation in the Czech Republic in 2014. In the practical part, an analysis of expenditure on security is carried out. Preventive policy of Prague is also discussed <b>and</b> <b>grant</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidy</b> programs, which are the source of its funding, are analyzed. Moreover, the criminality in Prague is analyzed not only globally, but also in the territory of Prague 1, 5 and 11 which show an increased incidence of crime...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} government policy on the risk profile of a small ethanol production facility. We derive four key results from a simulation model. First, we show that commodity price risk may discourage investment in a project, despite a positive expected rate of return. Second, we show that political uncertainty may have significant impacts on the risk profile of a project. Next, we show that using only production subsidies to attract investors is expensive, since the financial assistance is paid {{regardless of whether the}} plant is operating under positive or negative financial conditions. Finally, we show that a capital grant provides a valuable complement to a subsidy, because the grant reduces the amount of value investors must put at risk, and increases their leverage thereby enhancing returns, while the subsidy mitigates commodity price risk. Our results show that compared to a subsidy-only approach, a <b>grant</b> <b>and</b> <b>subsidy</b> combination provides an investment environment with similar downside protection and expected returns for less than 60 % of the cost. Further, we show that the two policy tools combined yield a superior investment environment to that created by an equivalent or greater total investment deployed entirely in either of the policy tools without the other.
