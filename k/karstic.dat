5|$|In some areas, the subsoil is <b>karstic.</b> It {{led to the}} {{formation}} of canyons, such as the Matka Canyon, which is surrounded by ten caves. They are between 20 and 176 m deep.|$|E
5|$|<b>Karstic</b> {{limestone}} formations, which {{comprise the}} main geological formations {{of the park}} and the plateau, are found in the park in the form of ponors (sinkholes) in small canyons and rock rims.|$|E
5|$|Populations of {{this species}} have {{historically}} been included in Miniopterus manavi, but evidence published in 2008 and 2009 indicates that M. manavi is a complex of five separate species, including the newly described M.aelleni. M.aelleni {{has been found in}} forests and caves in <b>karstic</b> areas. Its distribution overlaps that of M.griveaudi, also formerly included in M.manavi.|$|E
5|$|There are cave monasteries which functioned {{during the}} Second Bulgarian Empire as {{religious}} and cultural centres. They are located in <b>karstic</b> rock formations in the plateau and are difficult to access. Some of the notable caves are the Biserna Cave (Pearl Cave) and the Taynite Ponori Cave (the Secret Ponors Cave).|$|E
5|$|Deciduous forests cover 80% of the park's {{area and}} belong to 28 forest and 18 bush habitats. This variety {{is due to}} the lower river valleys, the sea coast and the <b>karstic</b> terrain. These include forests of oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), sessile oak (Quercus petraea), Strandzhan oak (Quercus hartwissiana), Hungarian oak (Quercus frainetto), common {{hornbeam}} (Carpinus betulus), oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis) and small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) with undergrowth of pontic rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum), Caucasian whortleberry (Vaccinium arctostaphylos), cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus), Black Sea holly (Ilex colchica), Himalayan meadow primrose (Primula rosea) and common heather (Calluna).|$|E
5|$|In 2009, it {{was also}} {{recorded}} from the cave of Ankilitelo in southwestern Madagascar. Remains of a large Macrotarsomys had previously been reported from other southern Madagascar sites, and {{at least some of}} these may be M.petteri. A <b>karstic</b> deposit near Lake Tsimanampetsotsa (dated to the Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene on unclear grounds) contained three species of Macrotarsomys, including a very large one that may well be M.petteri. Remains identified as greater big-footed mouse have been reported from a cave at Ankazoabo in southern Madagascar; these may also be Petter's big-footed mouse.|$|E
5|$|The subsoil {{contains}} a large water table which is alimented by the Vardar river and functions as an underground river. Under the table lies an aquifer contained in marl. The water table is 4 to 12 m {{under the ground}} and 4 to 144 m deep. Several wells collect its waters {{but most of the}} drinking water used in Skopje comes from a <b>karstic</b> spring in Rašče, located west of the city.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} Petén {{was the last}} stage of the conquest of Guatemala, a {{prolonged}} conflict during the Spanish colonisation of the Americas. A wide lowland plain covered with dense rainforest, Petén contains a central drainage basin {{with a series of}} lakes and areas of savannah. It is crossed by several ranges of low <b>karstic</b> hills and rises to the south as it nears the Guatemalan Highlands. The conquest of Petén, a region now incorporated into the modern republic of Guatemala, climaxed in 1697 with the capture of Nojpetén, the island capital of the Itza kingdom, by Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to European colonisers.|$|E
5|$|There are argentiferous (i.e. silver-bearing) galena {{deposits}} on Flat Holm; {{the pits}} and mounds {{visible on the}} surface of the island are a result of trial borings. A dispute over lead mining rights in the 1780s ended with John Stuart, Lord Mount Stuart making an official complaint that the lighthouse keeper was using the coals intended for the lighthouse for processing lead. Mining for lead was not profitable, however, and the works were abandoned. Red marl from the Triassic Period fills joints in the Carboniferous Limestone showing evidence of <b>karstic</b> (cave forming) processes during this period. Caves on the western and north-eastern sides of the island were used during the years of smuggling.|$|E
5|$|A {{special feature}} of the limestone, {{resulting}} from its weathering by water, is its <b>karstic</b> nature. During the large Middle Pleistocene glaciations, surface runoff from glacial meltwaters would have fed directly into the river channel network {{because much of the}} upland limestone terrain was covered by ice, and many conduits in the karst would have been choked with sediment or permanently frozen. As a result, the glacier snouts came close to the modern valley bottoms. In contrast, during interglacial and interstadial periods, more effective coupling occurred between the surface drainage network and the internal karst drainage system. Since limestone dissolves as the water percolates through its pores, an extended underground drainage system has developed, with caves and channels that enlarge with time when their roofs collapse, producing rocky exposures and perpendicular slopes, which is also the reason why the water is scarce. Only when an impenetrable stratum is met, does water appear on the surface.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{there are}} two groups of landforms in the Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng area, namely non-karstic and <b>karstic</b> landforms. Non-karstic landforms {{includes}} three types: The middle and low dome-block mountains developed in intrusive magmatic massifs; The middle denudation-structural mountain belts developed in terrigenous rocks of Cretaceous age; and The low block-denudational mountain belts developed in other terrigenous rocks. <b>Karstic</b> landforms {{in this area are}} of typical tropical karst which are divided into two groups of forms: The <b>karstic</b> forms on the surface including cone and tower karst, karrens, valleys and dolines, border polje, etc.; The underground karst consisting of caves.|$|E
25|$|In the massif's <b>karstic</b> {{area is the}} Vercors Cave System and the Gouffre Berger.|$|E
25|$|The lime rocks {{have been}} {{weathered}} into characteristic <b>karstic</b> rock formations known as rauks. Fossils, mainly of rugose corals and brachiopods, are abundant throughout the island; palæo-sea-stacks are preserved in places.|$|E
25|$|Especially {{interesting}} {{are five}} Phoxinellus (sub)species that inhabit isolated <b>karstic</b> plains (fields) of eastern {{as well as}} western Herzegovina in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which eventually reach the Neretva watershed and/or coastal drainages of south-eastern Dalmatia.|$|E
25|$|Turskyi Dace (Leuciscus turskyi also Squalius turskyi turskyi and Telestes turskyi) inhabits <b>karstic</b> waters, lake Buško Blato and the Krka and Čikola Rivers. It {{occurs on}} the low plains, with little current and in lakes. It feeds on invertebrates. Threats include water {{abstraction}} and pollution. It is considered Critically Endangered (CR).|$|E
25|$|Illyrian Dace (Squalius illyricus also Leuciscus illyricus Heckel & Kner 1858) inhabits <b>karstic</b> {{waters of}} Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Albania. It occurs in water courses on low plains, with little current. It feeds on invertebrates. It is {{stressed}} by habitat destruction, pollution and introduced species. It is considered Near Threatened (NT).|$|E
25|$|Dalmatian Barbelgudgeon (Aulopyge hugeli) inhabits <b>karstic</b> {{streams of}} Glamocko field, Livanjsko field and Duvanjsko field, lakes Buško Blato, Blidinje and Cetina, Krka and Zrmanja river drainages. It occurs in lentic waters and feeds on plants. The fish is {{threatened}} by water pollution and habitat destruction and is considered endangered. It is migratory in Livanjsko field.|$|E
25|$|Viñales is a {{small town}} and {{municipality}} in the north-central Pinar del Río Province of Cuba. The town consists mostly of one-story wooden houses with porches. The municipality is dominated by low mountain ranges of the Cordillera de Guaniguanico such as Sierra de los Órganos. Typical outcrops known as mogotes complete the <b>karstic</b> character of the landscape.|$|E
25|$|In Syria, three rivers add {{their water}} to the Euphrates; the Sajur, the Balikh and the Khabur. These rivers rise {{in the foothills of}} the Taurus Mountains along the Syro–Turkish border and add {{comparatively}} little {{water to the}} Euphrates. The Sajur is the smallest of these tributaries; emerging from two streams near Gaziantep and draining the plain around Manbij before emptying into the reservoir of the Tishrin Dam. The Balikh receives most of its water from a <b>karstic</b> spring near 'Ayn al-'Arus and flows due south until it reaches the Euphrates at the city of Raqqa. In terms of length, drainage basin and discharge, the Khabur is the largest of these three. Its main <b>karstic</b> springs are located around Ra's al-'Ayn, from where the Khabur flows southeast past Al-Hasakah, where the river turns south and drains into the Euphrates near Busayrah. Once the Euphrates enters Iraq, there are no more natural tributaries to the Euphrates, although canals connecting the Euphrates basin with the Tigris basin exist.|$|E
25|$|Gornje Blato-Deransko Lake is {{supplied}} by the <b>karstic</b> water sources of the Trebišnjica River, emerging from bordering hills. It is hydro-geologically connected to the Neretva River through its effluent, the Krupa River, formed out of five lakes (Škrka, Deranja, Jelim, Orah, Drijen). Large portions are permanently flooded and isolated by wide groves of reedbebds and trees. It represents a more interesting preserved area.|$|E
25|$|Xerocrassa geyeri is {{xerophilous}} {{species and}} it is found today in open calcareous or loessic grass and scrublands with a sparse vegetation cover on mountaintops, <b>karstic</b> highland plateaus and disturbed pastures, which are thought to constitute ecological refuges. In southeastern France it inhabits localities from 900 to 1000 m above sea level, but as anomaly it was found also in 370 m above sea level in Mont Vertoux.|$|E
25|$|Importantly {{relatively}} low solubility compounds {{are found to}} be soluble in more extreme environments resulting in geochemical and geological observations of the activity of hydrothermal fluids in the Earth's crust. These are often the source of high quality economic mineral deposits and precious or semi-precious gems. In the same way compounds with low solubility will dissolve over extended time (geological time) resulting in significant effects such as extensive cave systems or <b>Karstic</b> land surfaces.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} popular attractions in Bayamón is the Parque de las Ciencias. It is a science-themed park with various {{exhibitions}} and attractions. It is the only place, outside of the United States, where NASA rockets and parts are exhibited. It is located in the middle of <b>karstic</b> hills. An observation building on one of the hills gives {{a good view of the}} metropolitan area. That building also hosts antennas for government and civil communication.|$|E
25|$|Danilo Dolci {{was born}} in the <b>Karstic</b> town of Sežana (now in Slovenia), at the time part of the Italian border region known as Julian March. His father was an {{agnostic}} Sicilian railway official, while his mother, Meli Kokelj, was a deeply Catholic local Slovene woman. The young Danilo grew up in Mussolini’s fascist state. As a teenager Dolci saw Italy enter into World War II. He worried his family by tearing down any Fascist war posters he came across.|$|E
25|$|The Mayan {{landscape}} is a ritual topography, with landmarks such as mountains, wells and caves being assigned to specific ancestors and deities (see also Maya cave sites). Thus, the Tzotzil town of Zinacantan {{is surrounded by}} seven 'bathing places' of mountain-dwelling ancestors, {{with one of these}} sacred waterholes serving as the residence of the ancestors' 'nursemaids and laundresses'. As in the pre-Hispanic past, an important part of ritual takes place in or near such landmarks, in Yucatán also around <b>karstic</b> sinkholes (cenotes).|$|E
25|$|Within the {{limestone}} areas of Wales, there have arisen <b>karstic</b> landscapes during the postglacial period, though elements {{of these were}} initiated during and even before successive ice ages. Limestone pavements are best developed along the 'north crop' within the Brecon Beacons National Park and there are numerous sinkholes and shakeholes, together with sinks, sections of dry valley and resurgences. Cave development is extensive and includes systems such as Ogof Ffynnon Ddu (Britain's deepest cave), Dan-yr-ogof (partly showcave) and Wales' most extensive system Ogof Draenen.|$|E
25|$|Cancrocaeca {{is known}} only from fresh water in three <b>karstic</b> caves in Maros Regency, Sulawesi (Indonesia). At {{the time of}} its discovery, no troglobitic members of the family Hymenosomatidae were known, {{although}} Danièle Guinot had predicted in 1988 that the family was a likely candidate to produce troglobites. Since that time, further troglobitic species have been discovered in the same family; although they resemble Cancrocaeca superficially, this is thought to result from convergent evolution, and it is thought likely that Cancrocaeca arose recently from marine ancestors.|$|E
25|$|The {{state is}} {{noted for its}} {{mountains}} and rolling hills, its historically significant logging and coal mining industries, and its political and labor history. It {{is one of the}} most densely <b>karstic</b> areas in the world, making it a choice area for recreational caving and scientific research. The karst lands contribute to much of the state's cool trout waters. It is also known for a wide range of outdoor recreational opportunities, including skiing, whitewater rafting, fishing, hiking, backpacking, mountain biking, rock climbing, and hunting.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} {{substantial}} aquifers are the Pacific Coastal Plain alluvium and the <b>karstic</b> and fractured limestone that extend beneath the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes, Sierra de Chama, and Peten Lowlands. Other more limited aquifers {{are important for}} small-scale local demands. The mountains and hills of Guatemala contain many other types of aquifers, including volcanic pyroclastic and lava deposits, low permeability sediments, igneous, and metamorphic aquifers. Alluvial plains, valleys and lowlands make up about 50% of the countries territory and contain about 70% of the available ground water reserves.|$|E
25|$|The main {{sources of}} water supply for Damascus are the Fijeh and Barada springs. The Fijeh springs are {{a group of three}} large <b>karstic</b> springs - The Fijeh main spring, the Fijeh side spring and the Harouch spring - in the Barada gorge. The three springs used to {{contribute}} half the flow of the Barada River. The Barada spring is located North of the Fijeh springs close to the Lebanese border. The entire flow of all these springs is captured today, including through wells positioned around the springs. This is why it appears during the summer that the Barada spring has dried up, while its flow is actually being captured and transferred along the river to supply various towns in the Barada gorge as well as Damascus itself with drinking water. Water from the Barada and Fijeh springs is transferred to a mixing station near Dummar where it is being chlorinated and distributed to the city. The city’s water supply is complemented by well fields in the plains around the city. The flow of the springs is highly seasonal, lagging several months behind the precipitation because of snow melt and the <b>karstic</b> characteristics of the rocks from which they emerge. The flow of the Figeh springs is less than 4 m3/second during the low-flow period from July to December. However, it reaches a maximum of more than 12m3/second (average 1962-1991) in April.|$|E
25|$|Tourism {{is also an}} {{important}} part of the province's economy. Though the town of Pinar del Río (the provincial capital) has some places of cultural and historical interest (such as the Cathedral of San Rosendo, a 19th-century construction), most attractions are to be found in rural or natural settings. A major destination is the Viñales Valley, a <b>karstic</b> depression located in the Sierra de los Organos, north of the town of Viñales. Designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999 because of its natural beauty and the traditional agricultural techniques which continue to be used in the cultivation of tobacco and other crops there, the valley is a popular hiking and rock climbing location.|$|E
25|$|The Pindus range {{continues}} through the central Peloponnese, crosses {{the islands of}} Kythera and Antikythera and finds its way into southwestern Aegean, in the island of Crete where it eventually ends. The islands of the Aegean are peaks of underwater mountains that once constituted {{an extension of the}} mainland. Pindus is characterized by its high, steep peaks, often dissected by numerous canyons {{and a variety of other}} <b>karstic</b> landscapes. The spectacular Vikos Gorge, part of the Vikos-Aoos National Park in the Pindus range, is listed by the Guinness book of World Records as the deepest gorge in the world. Another notable formation are the Meteora rock pillars, atop which have been built medieval Greek Orthodox monasteries.|$|E
25|$|Some lakes can {{disappear}} seasonally. These {{are called}} intermittent lakes, ephemeral lakes, or seasonal lakes {{and can be}} found in <b>karstic</b> terrain. A prime example of an intermittent lake is Lake Cerknica in Slovenia or Lag Prau Pulte in Graubünden. Other intermittent lakes are only the result of above-average precipitation in a closed, or endorheic basin, usually filling dry lake beds. This can occur in some of the driest places on earth, like Death Valley. This occurred in the spring of 2005, after unusually heavy rains. The lake did not last into the summer, and was quickly evaporated (see photos to right). A more commonly filled lake of this type is Sevier Lake of west-central Utah.|$|E
25|$|Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng {{contains}} two dozens of mountain peaks with over 1,000metres in height. Noteworthy peaks are the Peak Co Rilata with {{a height of}} 1,128 m and the Peak Co Preu with a height of 1,213 m. Mounts in <b>karstic</b> area of the park rise at typical height of above 800m constitute a continuous range along Laotian-Vietnamese borderline, of which notable summits above 1000m are: Phu Tạo (1174m), Co Unet (1150m), Phu Canh (1095m), Phu Mun (1078m), Phu Tu En (1078m), Phu On Chinh (1068m), Phu Dung (1064m), Phu Tu Ôc (1053m), Phu Long (1015m), Phu Ôc (1015m), Phu Dong (1002m). Inserting into these summits are 800–1000m high summits of Phu Sinh (965m), Phu Co Tri (949m), Phu On Boi (933m), Phu Tu (956m), Phu Toan (905m), Phu Phong (902m) and núi Ma Ma (835m).|$|E
500|$|The Jeita Grotto (...) is {{a system}} of two separate, but interconnected, <b>karstic</b> {{limestone}} caves spanning an overall length of nearly [...] The caves are situated in the Nahr al-Kalb valley within the locality of Jeita, [...] north of the Lebanese capital Beirut. Though inhabited in prehistoric times, the lower cave was not rediscovered until 1836 by Reverend William Thomson; {{it can only be}} visited by boat since it channels an underground river that provides fresh drinking water to more than a million Lebanese.|$|E
500|$|El Chal {{is located}} in the {{municipality}} of Dolores in the department of Petén in northern Guatemala. El Chal is [...] south of Flores, the departmental capital. The archaeological site is within the southern area of a village also named El Chal, [...] to the south of the highway to Flores. The site is situated in the central Petén wet savanna in a well-drained area not subject to seasonal flooding. The local topography is <b>karstic</b> in nature, and includes hills that support some of the city's architecture.|$|E
