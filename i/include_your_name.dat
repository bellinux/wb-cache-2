40|$|What is a Résumé? A résumé is a {{marketing}} tool, a personal advertisement, {{used to help}} you get an interview. It is a one-page (sometimes two-page) document that briefly highlights your educational background, experience, and skills. It is not an autobiography. The most effective résumé must be well written, concise, organized and clearly focused on a specific job title and address the employer’s stated requirements for the position. The more you know about the duties and skills required for the job – and organize your résumé round these points – the more effective your résumé will be. Keep in mind there is no one correct way to write a résumé. It depends on your unique education, experiences, and skills. General Guidelines Your résumé has 20 - 30 seconds to catch an employer’s eye and get an interview. Make it count! Paper When printing your résumé for submission by mail or in person, use high-quality paper in conservative colors (white, ivory, or very pale gray). Do not use paper with visible flecks in it. Use a laser printer to print your document.

Smoking, diet, genetic susceptibility and immunosuppression (due to HIV infection or drug use) are risk factors for acquisition of both HPV infection and the progression to cancer. Testing for HPV DNA can now be performed on specimens collected by cervicovaginal lavage or in the newer liquid-based Pap tests. HPV testing is now advised for women with mildly abnormal or atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) Pap test results and of low-risk post-menopausal women with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) results. As of this printing, however, the FDA has not approved HPV testing as a routine screening tool. Vaccines are under development that would protect from infection by the oncogenic strains of HPV, especially type 16, which accounts for about one half of cervical cancer cases in the U. S, and to boost the immune systems of those already infected. None of these vaccines is yet licensed...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} what constitutes identities in cryptography. Typical examples <b>include</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> and your social-security number, or your fingerprint/iris-scan, or your address, or your (non-revoked) publickey coming from some trusted public-key infrastructure. In many situations, however, {{where you are}} defines your identity. For example, we know {{the role of a}} bank-teller behind a bullet-proof bank window not because she shows us her credentials but by merely knowing her location. In this paper, we initiate the study of cryptographic protocols where the identity (or other credentials and inputs) of a party are derived from its geographic location. We start by considering the central task in this setting, i. e., securely verifying the position of a device. Despite much work in this area, we show that in the Vanilla (or standard) model, the above task (i. e., of secure positioning) is impossible to achieve. In light of the above impossibility result, we then turn to the Bounded Retrieval Model (a variant of the Bounded Storage Model) and formalize and construct information theoretically secure protocols for two fundamental tasks: • Secure Positioning; and • Position Based Key Exchange. We then show that these tasks are in fact universal in this setting – we show how we can use them to realize Secure Multi-Party Computation. Our main contribution in this paper is threefold: to place the problem of secure positioning on a sound theoretical footing; to prove a strong impossibility result that simultaneously shows the insecurity of previous attempts at the problem; and to present positive results by showing that the bounded-retrieval framework is, in fact, one of the “right ” frameworks (there may be others) to study the foundations of position-based cryptography...|$|E
