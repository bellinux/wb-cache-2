2500|$|Brando's next film, Julius Caesar (1953), {{received}} {{highly favorable}} reviews. Brando portrayed Mark Antony. While most acknowledged Brando's talent, some critics felt Brando's [...] "mumbling" [...] and other idiosyncrasies betrayed {{a lack of}} acting fundamentals and, when his casting was announced, many remained dubious about his prospects for success. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and co-starring British stage actor John Gielgud, Brando delivered an impressive performance, especially during Antony's noted [...] "Friends, Romans, countrymen..." [...] speech. Gielgud was so impressed that he offered Brando a full season at the Hammersmith Theatre, an offer he declined. In his biography on the actor, Stefan Kanfer writes, [...] "Marlon's autobiography devotes one line to his work on that film: Among all those British professionals, 'for me to walk onto a movie set and play Mark Anthony was asinine'—yet another example of his persistent self-denigration, and wholly incorrect." [...] Kanfer adds that after a screening of the film, director John Huston commented, [...] "Christ! It was like a <b>furnace</b> <b>door</b> opening—the heat came off the screen. I don't know another actor who could do that." [...] During the filming of Julius Caesar, Brando learned that Elia Kazan had cooperated with congressional investigators, naming a whole string of [...] "subversives" [...] to the House Committee on Un-American Activities. By all accounts, Brando was upset by his mentor's decision, but he worked with him again in On The Waterfront. [...] "None of us is perfect," [...] he later wrote in his memoir, [...] "and I think that Gadg has done injury to others, but mostly to himself." ...|$|E
60|$|The most {{important}} work was {{to draw the}} fires, and by following Joe's example Bob so far aided in this that five minutes later the glowing coals were in the ash-pan or strewn on the cement flooring immediately {{in front of the}} <b>furnace</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{turning her}} back to me she smiled on him so sweetly that {{although}} really he was more loth to go than I, Leo would have followed her through a <b>furnace</b> <b>door,</b> as indeed, had he but known it, he was about to do.|$|E

60|$|As {{the curtain}} rises, the <b>furnace</b> <b>doors</b> are shut. The men {{are taking a}} {{breathing}} spell. One or two are arranging the coal behind them, pulling it into more accessible heaps. The others can be dimly made out leaning on their shovels in relaxed attitudes of exhaustion.|$|R
60|$|SCENE--The stokehole. In the rear, the dimly-outlined bulks of the {{furnaces}} and boilers. High overhead one hanging electric bulb sheds {{just enough}} {{light through the}} murky air laden with coal dust to pile up masses of shadows everywhere. A line of men, stripped to the waist, is before the <b>furnace</b> <b>doors.</b> They bend over, looking neither to right nor left, handling their shovels {{as if they were}} part of their bodies, with a strange, awkward, swinging rhythm. They use the shovels to throw open the <b>furnace</b> <b>doors.</b> Then from these fiery round holes in the black a flood of terrific light and heat pours full upon the men who are outlined in silhouette in the crouching, inhuman attitudes of chained gorillas. The men shovel with a rhythmic motion, swinging as on a pivot from the coal which lies in heaps on the floor behind to hurl it into the flaming mouths before them. There is a tumult of noise--the brazen clang of the <b>furnace</b> <b>doors</b> as they are flung open or slammed shut, the grating, teeth-gritting grind of steel against steel, of crunching coal. This clash of sounds stuns one's ears with its rending dissonance. But there is order in it, rhythm, a mechanical regulated recurrence, a tempo. And rising above all, making the air hum with the quiver of liberated energy, the roar of leaping flames in the furnaces, the monotonous throbbing beat of the engines.|$|R
60|$|He {{went out}} of the room, and she heard him walking about his room in the L, putting {{together}} his few belongings. Then she heard him go down and open the <b>furnace</b> <b>door,</b> and she knew he was giving a final conscientious look at the fire. He closed it, and she heard him close the basement door behind him, and knew that he was gone.|$|E
6000|$|It is a wild {{adventure}} we are on. Here, as we {{are rushing}} along through the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike us, with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways. Into a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the <b>furnace</b> <b>door</b> [...] .|$|E
60|$|This {{was plain}} enough, and Austin {{decided that if}} Jefferson meant to stay on board it was his affair, while he was far from sure that he would gain {{anything}} by attempting to dissuade him, even had there been time available. As it was, he realised that the lighter would probably go ashore while they discussed the question, and he signed to the Spanish fireman, who started the little engine full speed ahead, and then opened the <b>furnace</b> <b>door.</b> There was a gush of flame from the funnel, and the tow-rope tightened with a bang that jerked the launch's stern under. Then, while she was held down by the wallowing lighter a big, white-topped sea burst across her forward, {{and for a few}} seconds Austin, drenched and battered by the flying spray, could see nothing at all. When it blew astern he made out Jefferson standing knee deep in water at the lighter's helm, though there was very little else visible through the rush of white-streaked brine. Austin shouted to the fireman, who once more opened the <b>furnace</b> <b>door,</b> for that cold douche had suddenly made a different man of him.|$|E

6000|$|... “At {{first it}} stunned me. When the shell burst in the boiler it threw both the <b>furnace</b> <b>doors</b> open, and the fuse {{from the shell}} struck my feet. It was a terrible crash, and the {{boiler-room}} was filled with dust and steam. For several seconds I was partially stunned, and my ears rang so I could hear nothing. I went up on the deck to report to Captain Bernadou.|$|R

[At this last all the men, who have {{followed}} his movements of getting into position, throw open their <b>furnace</b> <b>doors</b> with a deafening clang.

60|$|The night {{got very}} dark, for the land-breeze brought off a haze, but the engine lamp and {{glow from the}} <b>furnace</b> <b>door</b> threw an elusive glimmer about the craft. White sea-crests chased and caught her up, and rolling forward broke between the funnel and the bows. Water splashed on board, the engine hissed as the spray fell on it, and the {{floorings}} got wet. One could see the foam on deck wash about the headledge forward as the bows went up with a sluggishness that was the consequence of carrying an extra load of coal.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly, cresting the heavy, sandy pass, Ursula {{lifted her}} head, and shrank back, {{momentarily}} frightened. There {{was a great}} whiteness confronting her, the moon was incandescent as a round <b>furnace</b> <b>door,</b> out of which came the high blast of moonlight, over the seaward half of the world, a dazzling, terrifying glare of white light. They shrank {{back for a moment}} into shadow, uttering a cry. He felt his chest laid bare, where the secret was heavily hidden. He felt himself fusing down to nothingness, like a bead that rapidly disappears in an incandescent flame.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} Austin {{had gone}} down to the stoke-hold. The place was dimly lighted, and insufferably hot, for, with the Cumbria stationary, no more air came down the ventilator shafts than the fires would draw, and they were burning sulkily. In fact, it was only by strenuous labour that steam could be raised at all. Here and there the pale flicker of an oil lamp emphasised the gloom, though there were three half-moon patches of brightness {{in each of the}} two boilers, until a fierce red glow beat out as Tom, the donkey-man, flung open a <b>furnace</b> <b>door.</b> Then Austin gained some impression of his surroundings.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of manufacturing furnace optimized re-design. The bottleneck in the production process is the cooling of heat treatment furnaces. These ovens are on an approximate 24 -hour cycle, heating for 12 hours and cooling for 12 hours. Pressurized argon and process water are used to expedite cooling. The proposed modifications aim to minimize cycling by reducing cooling time; they are grouped into three fundamental mechanisms. The first is a recommendation to modify current operating procedures. This entails opening the <b>furnace</b> <b>doors</b> at higher than normal temperatures. A furnace temperature model based on current parameters is used to show the reduction in cooling time in response to opening the <b>furnace</b> <b>doors</b> at higher temperatures. The second mechanism considers the introduction of forced argon convection. Argon is used in the process to mitigate part oxidation. Cycling argon through the furnace during cooling increases convection over the parts and removes heat from the furnace envelope. Heat transfer models based on convective Nusselt correlations are used to determine the increase in heat transfer rate. The last mechanism considers a modification to the current heat exchanger. By decreasing the temperature of the water jacket and increasing heat exchanger efficiency, heat transfer from the furnace is increased and cooling time is shortened. This analysis is done using the Effectiveness-NTU method...|$|R
500|$|The {{process of}} {{destroying}} the tally sticks began at dawn on 16 October and continued throughout the day; two Irish labourers, Joshua Cross and Patrick Furlong, were assigned the task. Weobley checked {{in on the}} men throughout the day, claiming subsequently that, on his visits, both <b>furnace</b> <b>doors</b> were open, which allowed the two labourers to watch the flames, while the piles of sticks in both furnaces were only ever [...] high. Another witness to the events, Richard Reynolds, the firelighter in the Lords, later {{reported that he had}} seen Cross and Furlong throwing handfuls of tallies onto the fire—an accusation they both denied.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, Karl Hurm {{increasingly}} integrated {{objects of}} everyday life into his paintings, in order to add a third dimension. Fragments of panty hoses, shoelaces, brush bristles, chain links, wire mesh, string bags, twigs and beechnuts were pasted into compositions in the collage technique. Chewing gum, pressed flat into moulds as bas-reliefs, slightly raise figures above the surface to produce sculptural effects. During that same period, Karl Hurm also experimented with different surfaces like old <b>furnace</b> <b>doors,</b> iron plates, metal sheets, or pieces of wood as base materials {{in order to create}} paintings that seem to have originated in distant prehistoric times. The specific fabrics and structures were interpreted and accentuated by the colours.|$|R
60|$|Kit pondered, for he {{had taken}} some {{soundings}} when coming out. They were probably not correct, because the launch had rolled among the white combers that swept the shoals while he used the lead, but the average depth was about the steamer's draught in her usual trim. Mayne, however, ought to know what depth to expect, and Kit hoped he had loaded the vessel to correspond. By and by the mulatto fireman shut the <b>furnace</b> <b>door,</b> the puzzling light was cut off, and Kit searched the horizon. For some minutes, he saw nothing; and then a trail of red fire soared into the sky.|$|E

50|$|Engine Co. No. 7 {{also helped}} fight the {{fire at the}} Evening Star {{building}} {{on the morning of}} April 13, 1892. A young man had been burning paper refuse in the furnace and left the <b>furnace</b> <b>doors</b> open, which quickly created a large fire. After a general alarm was sounded, Engine Co. No. 7 soon arrived at the scene and fought the fire {{from the rear of the}} building. Luckily, no one was injured. The company was not as lucky in the fire of the Louisiana Avenue Commission House on May 18, 1896, where at least twenty-two buildings burned to the ground between 10th Street and B Street. Michael Berry, a private in the company, suffered severe injuries. Engine Co. No. 7 was also present at the January 1922 roof collapse at the Knickerbocker Theater, located at the corner of 18th Street and Columbia Road, N.W., which resulted in the deaths of 97 people.|$|R
5000|$|The Stirling {{water tube}} boiler {{is the largest}} {{component}} of the steam plant, located at the northeast side {{of the group of}} objects, nearest the street intersection.

As for her, during his speech she has listened, paralyzed with horror, terror, her whole personality crushed, beaten in, collapsed, by the terrific impact of this unknown, abysmal brutality, naked and shameless.

60|$|Another man {{flung open}} the <b>furnace</b> <b>door,</b> a sudden stream of {{brightness}} flashed {{out as he}} hurled in coal, the door shut with a clang, {{and there was a}} whirr of slipping wheels as the engineer laid his hand on the lever. The great locomotive panted, and Grant, staring out through the glasses, saw a blinking light slide back to them. Then, the plates beneath him trembled, the hammering wheels got hold, and the muffled clanging and thudding swelled into a rhythmic din. The light darted past them, the filmy whiteness which had streamed down through the big headlamp's glare now beat in a bewildering rush against the quivering glass, and the fan-shaped blaze of radiance drove on faster through the snow.|$|E
60|$|Grant {{sat down}} on a tool-locker, took out his cigar-case, and passed it to Breckenridge who sat {{opposite}} him. Breckenridge's face was eager and there was an unusual brightness in his eyes, for he was young and something thrilled within him in unison with the vibration of the great machine. There was, however, very little to see just then beyond the tense, motionless figure of the man at the throttle and the damp-beaded face of another forced up in the lurid glare from the <b>furnace</b> <b>door.</b> A dim whiteness lashed the glasses, and when Breckenridge pressed his face to one of them the blaze of radiance against which the smoke-stack was projected blackly only intensified the obscurity they were speeding through.|$|E
60|$|We {{could hear}} her {{pounding}} along, but we didn't see her good till she was close. She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks he's mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we {{said she was going}} to try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit. She was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open <b>furnace</b> <b>doors</b> shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us. There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight through the raft.|$|R
60|$|Safe! I'm {{not sure}} now that I {{come to think}} of it that it isn't worse than sinking in the Atlantic.

60|$|Then {{there was}} {{a change in the}} sound and motion, and Foster knew the engine was running all-out.

3000|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} the {{performance}} assessment of CO 2 capture in a membrane gas absorption pilot unit installed in a Greek brick production industry (V. Maliouris S.A.). In the brick production process, large quantities of CO 2 are released to the atmosphere during bricks calcination. In this step, the bricks enter the process furnace where they are heated up to ~ 950  °C using crude oil as a fuel. Crude oil combustion except of CO 2 also results to the formation of SO 2, NO x [...] and other trace elements which further increase the loading of gas pollutants in the atmosphere. The company, except of the environmental considerations, has also profits from CO 2 emissions reduction, as it is placed in the Emissions Trading System (ETS) for CO 2 emissions monitoring. The special feature of this process is that the system is far from steady state, mainly because of <b>furnace</b> <b>doors</b> opening when wagons with bricks enter and exit the furnace. This causes significant dilution of flue gases and variability with time. All the above render the effective application of a membrane gas absorption unit for CO 2 capture, to be a very challenging task, which has not been studied extensively up to now.|$|R
