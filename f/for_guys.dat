500|$|George Ivan [...] "Van" [...] Morrison {{was born}} on 31 August 1945, at 125 Hyndford Street, Bloomfield, Belfast, Northern Ireland, as {{the only child of}} George Morrison, a {{shipyard}} electrician, and Violet Stitt Morrison, who had been a singer and tap dancer in her youth. Morrison's family roots descend from the Ulster Scots population that settled in Belfast. From 1950 to 1956, Morrison, who began to be known as [...] "Van" [...] during this time, attended Elmgrove Primary School. His father had what was at the time one of the largest record collections in Ulster (acquired during his time in Detroit, Michigan, in the early 1950s) and the young Morrison grew up listening to artists such as Jelly Roll Morton, Ray Charles, Lead Belly, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, and Solomon Burke; of whom he later said, [...] "If it weren't <b>for</b> <b>guys</b> like Ray and Solomon, I wouldn't be where I am today. Those guys were the inspiration that got me going. If it wasn't for that kind of music, I couldn't do what I'm doing now." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Little Bit" [...] {{was written}} by Kara DioGuardi, Steve Morales and David Siegal, and was {{produced}} by Morales and Ric Wake. The song became DioGuardi's first writing credit for an artist from her native country. Simpson's vocals were recorded by Dan Hetzel at Sony Music Studios, New York City, and the track was mixed by Hetzel along with Richie Jones at Cove City Sound Studios, Glen Cove, New York. Keyboard programming was done by Eric Kupper. According to Simpson, [...] "the message behind the song is <b>for</b> <b>guys</b> {{to listen to the}} girl". [...] "A guy needs to give {{a little bit more of}} himself, a little bit more of his time. It's about the love going so much further, the guy would actually be selfless," [...] she expanded on the song's theme. In the United States, [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was released as the second single from Irresistible. The song saw an airplay-only release there, while in Australia, a physical single was issued on October29,2001. [...] "A Little Bit" [...] was used to promote Bally Total Fitness and thus, a limited CD single pressing was made available to people who joined the club. The song was also utilized for the company's promotional advertisement campaign.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the initial}} {{growth of the}} fandom {{may have come from}} 4chan {{participants}} enjoying the ironic nature of grown men enjoying a show for girls, the fandom continues to grow based on sincere appreciation of the work. Robert Thompson, a professor of media studies at Syracuse University, stated that [...] "It's one thing <b>for</b> <b>guys</b> to like motorcycles and muscle cars and soccer. For a guy to like My Little Pony, it's so out there that it becomes almost avant garde. It has a hip quality to it." [...] According to Angela Watchcutter of Wired, the fandom is an example of internet neo-sincerity, where these older viewers watch the show [...] "un-ironically" [...] and [...] "without guilt" [...] breaking gender stereotypes, furthermore creating new material around it. Prof. Roberta Pearson of the University of Nottingham in film and television studies stated that [...] "This is a level of fan devotion I've not seen before," [...] while Prof. Charles Soukup of the University of Northern Colorado in communication studies suggested that this effort is an indication of the [...] "ultra-cult era" [...] that bronies exhibit, where [...] "media consumers discover extremely unexpected and obscure media texts to cultivate uniqueness and distinctiveness for their mediated identities".|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 NHL season, Panthers head coach Peter DeBoer, who first saw Horton play at seven years old, said about his hopes for Horton, [...] "If I'm looking <b>for</b> <b>guys</b> to do more, he wouldn't be at the top of the list. If he can give us 30-plus, I'd be happy with Nathan. There's a group of guys {{underneath}} him that I think can make a lot bigger jumps than I need out of Nathan Horton goal-wise." [...] Horton was also moved from his position of right wing to centre before the season. After playing a few games at centre, Horton said, [...] "It's not as easy as wing. You can play wing and all you have to concentrate on is getting the puck and shooting it. At center, you have more responsibilities." [...] Against the Nashville Predators on November 1, Horton played in his 300th career game, but failed to record a point. On November 26, Horton suffered a deep cut in his leg after it was stepped on by a skate. At the time of the injury, Horton had 6 goals and 7 assists. In early December, the Ottawa Sun reported that the Panthers might have been looking to trade Horton after he was reportedly unhappy playing for the team. Horton returned to the lineup on December 17 after missing eight games. After the game, Horton commented, [...] "I'm excited to play. It's kind of a different Panthers team than the past. It's really changed in a matter of a month. Things are going good now, and everybody's really buying into what Pete has been telling us all year." [...] On January 17, Horton recorded 3 assists to help the Panthers defeat Tampa Bay, 43. For the second time during the season, Horton's name came up in trade rumours, this time with the Chicago Blackhawks. In early March, days after the trade deadline, Horton suffered a finger injury that forced him to have surgery. He returned to the lineup on March 23, recording an assist in a Panthers loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. Horton ended the season with 22 goals and 23 assists in 67 games.|$|E

2500|$|When Kelly {{returned}} to Hollywood in 1953, the film musical was {{already beginning to}} feel the pressures from television, and MGM cut the budget for his next picture Brigadoon (1954), with Cyd Charisse, forcing {{him to make the}} film on studio back lots instead of on location in Scotland. This year also saw him appear as guest star with his brother Fred in the celebrated I Love to Go Swimmin' with Wimmen routine in Deep in My Heart. MGM's refusal to loan him out <b>for</b> <b>Guys</b> and Dolls and Pal Joey put further strains on his relationship with the studio. He negotiated an exit to his contract which involved making three further pictures for MGM. The first of these, It's Always Fair Weather (1956) co-directed with Donen, was a musical satire on television and advertising, and includes his famous roller skate dance routine to I Like Myself, and a dance trio with Michael Kidd and Dan Dailey that Kelly used to experiment with the widescreen possibilities of Cinemascope. MGM had lost faith in Kelly's box-office appeal, and as a result It's Always Fair Weather [...] "premiered" [...] at seventeen drive-in theatres around the Los Angeles metroplex. Next followed Kelly's last musical film for MGM, Les Girls (1957), in which he partnered a trio of leading ladies, Mitzi Gaynor, Kay Kendall, and Taina Elg. It too sold few movie tickets. The third picture he completed was a co-production between MGM and himself, a cheapie B-film, The Happy Road, set in his beloved France, his first foray in a new role as producer-director-actor. After leaving MGM, Kelly {{returned to}} stage work.|$|E
2500|$|Much of HIM's {{success has}} been {{attributed}} to vocalist and main songwriter Ville Valo. Vesa Sirén of Helsingin Sanomat described the band's music as achieving [...] "major crossover appeal" [...] by combining [...] "traditional Finnish melancholia", with [...] "gothic lyrics, walls of metal guitars, and keyboard riffs." [...] Vesterinen also singled out Valo's songwriting ability as a major component in HIM's success, stating: [...] "Charisma in something that you're somewhat born with [...] writing songs on the other hand is hard to learn, if you don't have the talent for it." [...] Juhani Merimaa also stated that with [...] "melodic, catchy and good songs", as well as being [...] "credible in the underground, and the mainstream", HIM had [...] "all the elements for breaking through". HIM also gained many fans through Valo's image, which Sirén described as utilizing [...] "the tried and true James Dean -formula, where sensitivity and edginess combined." [...] With all these elements, HIM garnered both male and female fans around the world, with Asko Kallonen, who first signed the band to BMG, recalling: [...] "For example in England it was hard to grasp. There the split was usually clear: hard rock was <b>for</b> <b>guys,</b> pop was for girls. HIM was listened to by both." [...] Juhani Merimaa felt similarly, stating: [...] "Unlike other metal bands, they appealed to the opposite sex." [...] Lance Teegarden of PopMatters has noted that HIM is [...] "not the sort of act that conjures up a lukewarm response [...] people either like them or discredit them outright". Some of the major criticism directed towards the band have centered around the supposed repetitive nature of their music and pandering towards teenage goth fans. HIM's association with Jackass member and skateboarder Bam Margera has also received some negative feedback.|$|E
