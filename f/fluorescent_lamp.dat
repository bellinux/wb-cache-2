25|$|A compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> is a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> {{designed}} to replace an incandescent lightbulb. Some CFL's fit into light fixtures formerly used for incandescent lamps {{and they are}} {{designed to}} produce the same amount of visible light found in incandescent light. CFLs generally use 70% less energy and have a longer rated life. In 1941, George Inman devised the first practical <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> while working for General Electric. The key patent for this light source, U.S. patent #2,259,040 was filed by Inman on April 22, 1936 and issued to him on October 14, 1941. In 1976, Edward E. Hammer invented the first helical or spiraled compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp,</b> but due to the difficulty of the manufacturing process for coating the interior of the spiral glass tube, General Electric did not manufacture or sell the device. Other companies began manufacturing and selling the device in 1995.|$|E
25|$|A compact <b>{{fluorescent}}</b> <b>lamp</b> (CFL), {{also called}} compact fluorescent light, energy-saving light, and compact fluorescent tube, is a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> designed to replace an incandescent light bulb; some types fit into light fixtures designed for incandescent bulbs. The lamps use a tube which is curved or folded {{to fit into}} the space of an incandescent bulb, and a compact electronic ballast in the base of the lamp.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps are {{negative}} differential resistance devices, so as more current flows through them, the electrical {{resistance of the}} <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> drops, allowing for even more current to flow. Connected directly to a constant-voltage power supply, a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> would rapidly self-destruct due to the uncontrolled current flow. To prevent this, fluorescent lamps must use an auxiliary device, a ballast, to regulate the current flow through the lamp.|$|E

40|$|The Australian {{government}} {{has introduced a}} policy to replace all inefficient incandescent lamps with energy saving compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> by 2010. However, unlike incandescence <b>lamps,</b> compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> do not draw sinusoidal currents at almost unity power factor. Therefore, implementation of this policy may introduce serious power quality problems for the power supply authorities. This paper investigates the impact of current harmonics generated {{by a number of}} different types of compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> commonly available in Australia, {{on the quality of the}} conventional supply. Experimental results are presented to show a comparison of the actual energy consumption, power factor, costs, Lumen levels and current harmonics of compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> and incandescent lamps. These results show that the power quality and the amount of light output from compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> do not depend on the cost of compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps.</b> Simulation results are presented using the experimental data to determine the impact of large influx of compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> on the third harmonic component present neutral current. It is also shown in this paper that direct replacement of incandescent lamps by equivalent wattage compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> may give rise to safety issues...|$|R

25|$|The higher {{initial cost}} of a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> {{compared}} with an incandescent lamp is usually more than compensated for by lower energy consumption over its life.|$|E
25|$|A <b>{{fluorescent}}</b> <b>lamp,</b> or fluorescent tube, is a low-pressure mercury-vapor gas-discharge lamp {{that uses}} fluorescence to produce visible light. An electric current {{in the gas}} excites mercury vapor, which produces short-wave ultraviolet light that then causes a phosphor coating {{on the inside of}} the lamp to glow. A <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> converts electrical energy into useful light much more efficiently than incandescent lamps. The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lighting systems is 50–100 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output.|$|E
40|$|Lighting {{has been}} one of the fastest growing {{electric}} end-uses in China over the last twenty years, with an average annual growth rate of 14 %. Fluorescent lighting provides a significant portion of China's lighting need. In 1998, China produced 680 million <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> of which 420 million were linear <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> of various diameters (T 8 to T 12). There are substantial variations both in energy efficiency and lighting performance among locally produced <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps.</b> Such variations present a perfect opportunity for policy intervention through efficiency standards to promote the adoption of more efficient <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> in China. This paper analyzes China's proposed minimum efficiency standard for <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> and presents an assessment of its likely impacts on China's lighting energy consumption and GHG emissions...|$|R

2500|$|Incandescent bulbs {{have been}} {{replaced}} in many applications by other types of electric light, such as <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> (CFL), cold cathode <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> (CCFL), high-intensity discharge lamps, and light-emitting diode lamps (LED). Some jurisdictions, such as the European Union, China, Canada and United States, {{are in the process}} of phasing out the use of incandescent light bulbs while others, including Colombia, Mexico, Cuba, Argentina [...] and Brazil, have prohibited them already.|$|R
50|$|Compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> {{are less}} {{efficient}} than LED or HID lamps, but run relatively cool and {{are widely available}} in simple fixtures and therefore continue to be used. Traditional <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> generally do not produce enough concentrated light to be a primary light source for most indoor growing operations. Fluorescent and compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> are excellent light sources for young plants (seedlings). They are also used to supplement the light generated by primary HID lamps.|$|R

25|$|Typically a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> {{will last}} 10 to 20 {{times as long}} as an {{equivalent}} incandescent lamp when operated several hours at a time. Under standard test conditions general lighting lamps have 9,000 hours or longer service life.|$|E

25|$|Fluorescent lamps come in many {{shapes and}} sizes. The compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> (CFL) is {{becoming}} more popular. Many compact fluorescent lamps integrate the auxiliary electronics into {{the base of the}} lamp, allowing them to fit into a regular light bulb socket.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they contain}} mercury, many <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> are {{classified}} as hazardous waste. The United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends that <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> be segregated from general waste for recycling or safe disposal, and some jurisdictions require recycling of them.|$|R
5000|$|Compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> (as well {{as regular}} <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> and LED-lightbulbs) {{can also be}} used as {{appropriate}} technology. Although they are less environmentally friendly then LED-lights, they are cheaper and still feature relative high efficiency (compared to incandescent lamps).|$|R
50|$|<b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> {{are used}} for UV curing {{in a number of}} applications. In particular, these are used where the {{excessive}} heat of mercury vapor is undesirable, or when an item needs more than a single source of light and instead the item needs to be surrounded by light, such as musical instruments. <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> can be created that produce ultraviolet anywhere within the UVA/UVB spectrum. Additionally, lamps that have multiple peaks are possible, allowing a wider variety of photoinitiators to be used. While <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> are less efficient at producing UV than mercury vapor, newer initiators require less total energy, offsetting this disadvantage. <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> {{in a wide variety of}} sizes and wattages are available.|$|R
25|$|Electrical {{circuits}} containing dominantly resistive loads (incandescent lamps, heating elements) have a {{power factor}} of almost 1.0, but circuits containing inductive or capacitive loads (electric motors, solenoid valves, transformers, <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> ballasts, and others) {{can have a}} power factor well below 1.|$|E
25|$|The {{ultraviolet}} {{light from a}} <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> can degrade the pigments in paintings (especially watercolor pigments) and bleach the dyes used in textiles and some printing. Valuable art work must be protected from {{ultraviolet light}} by placing additional glass or transparent acrylic sheets between the lamp and the art work.|$|E
25|$|The compact <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> (CFL) replaces regular {{incandescent}} bulbs. However, some CFLs {{will not}} fit some lamps, because the harp (heavy wire shade support bracket) is shaped for the narrow neck of an incandescent lamp, while CFLs {{tend to have}} a wide housing for their electronic ballast close to the lamp's base.|$|E
50|$|Proper {{recycling}} of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> can reduce risk of human exposure to mercury. Companies that recycle spent <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> include Air Cycle Corporation; Midwest Lamp Recycling, Inc.; Mercury Technologies of Minnesota, Inc.; USA Lamp & Ballast Recycling, Inc; Waste Management; and Veolia.|$|R

40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{proposed}} {{to measure the}} heat dissipation of LEDs and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> in an open system which allows light energy to escape. Based on this method, a comparative study on the thermal and luminous performance of high-brightness LEDs and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> is presented. At rated power, T 5 & T 8 <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> generate about 73 %- 77 % of their total power as heat, whilst three types of highbrightness LEDs dissipate about 87 % to 90 % of input power as heat. Heat dissipation {{is an important factor}} particularly for airconditioned buildings when overall energy efficiency is considered. T 5 <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> perform better than some existing LEDs in terms of luminous efficacy and heat generation in this study. © 2009 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
