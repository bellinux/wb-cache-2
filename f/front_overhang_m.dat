50|$|The 508 saloon is 4.79 m long, {{while the}} 508 SW (estate) is 4.81 m long. Compared to the Peugeot 407 the 508 has a shorter <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and a longer rear {{passenger}} compartment.|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, {{there were}} changes {{to improve the}} axle load, length and {{wheelbase}} remained unchanged with <b>front</b> <b>overhang,</b> also the engine power increased to 260 hp in the E120H. BU35 is added with 6 m wheelbase.|$|R
50|$|Walsall Corporation {{specified}} some non-standard short-wheelbase Fleetlines, {{the first}} of which, 1 UDH https://www.flickr.com/photos/54957550@N00/384166514/https://www.flickr.com/photos/8050359@N07/2334860070/, was only 25 ft 7 in long, had no <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and had its entrance behind the front axle. The next 29 vehicles were 27 ft 6 in long with a short <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and again only an entrance behind the front axle. The remaining 69 were 28 ft 6 in long, with a narrow entrance in the usual position along with the entrance behind the front axle. 1 UDH had Northern Counties bodywork with wrap-around windscreens on both decks, similar to that specified by Barton Transport on AEC Regents and a Dennis Loline.|$|R
50|$|Payload is 2 300 kg in {{terrain and}} 4 000 kg on road. The <b>front</b> <b>{{overhang}}</b> is 1 300 mm and rear overhang 1 000 mm. The turning radius is 7.6 metres and top speed 90 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Overhangs are {{the lengths}} {{of a car}} which extend beyond the {{wheelbase}} at the front and rear. They are normally described as <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and rear overhang. Practicality, style, and performance {{are affected by the}} size and weight of overhangs.|$|R
5000|$|The K9 is {{slightly}} {{shorter than the}} Equus, and has a longer wheelbase with shorter <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> dimensions. The K9 features Kia's [...] "Tiger nose" [...] grill as well as blind spot detection, head-up display and an adaptive front lighting system.|$|R
50|$|Volvo B7F and Volvo B7FA were {{a series}} of front-engined single-decker bus chassis {{manufactured}} by Volvo. While the B7FA was a more conventional front-engined chassis, the B7F had the engine mounted {{on top of the}} front axle, giving the buses very little <b>front</b> <b>overhang.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Wrightbus {{unveiled}} the Wright StreetCar {{which is a}} tram-like articulated bus built with modified B7LA chassis. The chassis has a shorter <b>front</b> <b>overhang,</b> the driver's cab relocated to above the front axle and the radiator relocated to the roof, giving a full-width rear window.|$|R
50|$|The parish hall has {{a simple}} gabled roof, with timber {{brackets}} supporting the <b>front</b> <b>overhang.</b> Above the entry is a projecting bay with a window, pilasters, arched head and rendered cornice. Along the street facade is a verandah with turned timber posts, and a gabled entry portico.|$|R
50|$|Criticisms of {{the design}} of the F56 MINI Cooper have focused upon the {{extruded}} and complex design of the front bumper in Cooper S and JCW variants, as well as the larger <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and oversized tail lamps. Further criticism has also centred upon the overstyled nature of the exterior design.|$|R
50|$|Along with clearance, {{length of}} {{overhangs}} affects the approach and departure angles, which measure the vehicle's ability to overcome steep obstacles and rough terrain. The longer the <b>front</b> <b>overhang,</b> the smaller is the approach angle, and thus lesser the car's ability to climb or descend steep ramps without damaging the front bumpers.|$|R
5000|$|... 26 were rebuilt by George Whale from Class B 4-cylinder {{compounds}} {{with the}} simple addition of a leading pony truck to reduce excessive <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> between 1904-1908. The only alteration was to wheelbase and weight, but when the letter classification system was introduced in 1911, this took them into a different class.|$|R
25|$|The GF-BNR34 (R34) Skyline GT-R, GT-R V·Spec and GT-R V·Spec N1 {{models were}} {{released}} in January 1999. The R34 GT-R was also shorter (from front to rear), and the <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> reduced. The valve covers were painted glossy red (colour code Cherry Red Effect Z24 or X1020), {{as opposed to}} black in previous models.|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} had 20 x 28 in inside cylinders driving 4 ft wheels. They had {{a distinctive}} <b>front</b> <b>overhang,</b> not possessed {{by any other}} GER 0-6-0 class. This was needed to clear the cylinder tail rods. Locomotive 1240 was fitted for a time with a Weir feedwater heater and pump, with the heater component mounted on the boiler between the dome and chimney.|$|R
25|$|In 1946, {{the company}} {{introduced}} their B-series of bus chassis, {{with the engine}} mounted above the front-axle, giving a short <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and the door behind the front-axle. The first generation consisted of the B15/B16, the B20/B21/B22 and the B31, primarily divided by weight class, and then by wheelbase. The latter became upgraded in 1948 and renamed 2B20/2B21/2B22 and 3B31. The T31/T32 trolleybus chassis was also available from 1947. In 1950, the next generation was introduced, with the B41/B42, the B61/B62/B63/B64 and later the B83. From then, Scania-Vabis also offered the BF-series chassis, available as BF61/BF62/BF63, which had the engine more conventionally mounted before the front-axle, leaving room for the door on a longer <b>front</b> <b>overhang.</b> From 1954, the B-series came as B51 and B71, and the BF as BF71 and later BF73. In 1959, the B55, B65 and B75, plus the BF75 were introduced, and were from 1963 available as B56, B66 and B76, plus the BF56 and BF76.|$|R
2500|$|Designed by Christopher Weil under design chief Adrian Van Hooydonk (till March 1, 2009), the F30/F31 {{has grown}} in all {{dimensions}} compared to its predecessor. The styling is similar to previous generations with a sweeping bonnet, short <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and long wheelbase typical. Headlamps now connect to a wide kidney grill. [...] Tail lamps sport a wide [...] "L" [...] shape design seen in many BMW models.|$|R
50|$|Trolleybuses {{continued}} to figure, on Sunbeam/Karrier, Crossley or BUT chassis. The most striking {{of these were}} the Coronation class vehicles built on Sunbeam MF2B chassis for Kingston upon Hull Corporation Transport. These had a front entrance on the <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and a central exit; they were fitted with twin staircases and were intended to be one-man operated so were equipped with trolley-pole retriever equipment at the rear.|$|R
50|$|In South Africa, AEC {{engineered}} its {{own style}} of Regal, the Kudu. This {{was made up}} of a Regal VI chassis, an AV690 (11.3-litre vertical engine) mounted on the <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> instead of under the floor. This allowed a reliably clean flow of air to the engine. There was still sufficient space to allow a front entrance ahead of the front axle, allowing the driver to supervise passenger loadings as on the standard Regal VI.|$|R
5000|$|Approach {{angle is}} the maximum angle of a ramp onto which a vehicle can climb from a {{horizontal}} plane without interference. [...] It {{is defined as}} the angle between the ground and the line drawn between the front tire and the lowest-hanging part of the vehicle at the <b>front</b> <b>overhang.</b> Departure angle is its counterpart {{at the rear of the}} vehicle - the maximum ramp angle from which the car can descend without damage. Approach and departure angles are also referred to as ramp angles.|$|R
50|$|The 170-series, {{launched}} in September 1999, features shorter <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> therefore maximizes interior and trunk space. There {{are two different}} 170-series 4-door Saloon; the Royal, and Athlete. The Majesta is a separate vehicle which is larger and longer than the Crown. The 4-door Hardtop was discontinued. The 170-series Estate {{launched in}} December 1999 was the first new Crown Wagon after the 130-series. Engine is either 2.0, 2.5, or 3.0. The Athlete V has 2.5-liter 1JZ-GTE turbo. The Royal was also offered with a 3.0-liter 2JZ-FSE mild hybrid.|$|R
25|$|The Railway Gazette, {{cited in}} Ahrons, {{suggests}} {{that there was an}} even earlier design for Cornwall, as a 2-2-2 with single 4' wheels both forward and back. It's uncertain if Cornwall was ever built in this form. The drawing does show a considerable <b>front</b> <b>overhang,</b> with a high load placed on the front axle. If constructed like this, the likelihood is that it would suffer the same problems as its contemporary, Gooch's first 2-2-2 Great Western class of 1846, where a broken front axle led to re-design as a 4-2-2.|$|R
500|$|A {{lightweight}} steel (not aluminium) {{structure and}} a rear-engined layout allowed Mitsubishi to incorporate a larger front crumple zone, {{in order to}} meet current safety legislation requirements without compromising interior space. With no powertrain in front of the driver, the designers were able to shorten the <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and lengthen the wheelbase to , giving greater legroom for passengers than many comparable kei cars whose wheelbase is typically [...] less. The downside of this design was a reduction in cargo-carrying capacity, which was necessarily compromised by the engine's location in the rear.|$|R
50|$|The Vinton-Torrey House is a {{historic}} house at 5 Torrey Road in Southbridge, Massachusetts. It was built in 1841 by J. Eliot Vinton, whose ancestor John acquired the land in 1738. The -story brick house may incorporate elements of an earlier house (possibly part of John Vinton's original house). The house expresses some Greek Revival characteristics in brick, notably pilasters on the corners. The doors and windows feature granite lintels, and the slightly larger <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> is a typical local feature. In the late 19th century the property belonged to E. M. Torrey.|$|R

50|$|The Leyland Swift was a midibus chassis {{manufactured}} by Leyland between 1987 and 1990 {{as a successor}} to the Leyland Cub. It shared many components with the Roadrunner light truck but with the engine relocated to behind the front axle which was itself set back to permit a passenger entrance in the <b>front</b> <b>overhang.</b> Mechanically a 6-cylinder Cummins B turbo-diesel powerplant was standard with the choice of synchromesh or Allison automatic gearboxes. It was available in a choice of short wheelbase (3.6 m) or long wheelbase (4.4 m). The first entered service in November 1987.|$|R
5000|$|The Kia K9 is {{an upscale}} {{full-size}} premium sedan from South Korean automaker Kia. It {{will replace the}} Opirus sedan in the Korean market, and will follow in the product line of the Kia K5 and Kia K7. The car is a derivative of the BH-L (VI) platform shared with the Hyundai Equus. The K9 is slightly shorter than the Equus, but has a more aggressive, sporty stance {{as well as a}} longer wheelbase with shorter <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> dimensions. Kia's signature [...] "Tiger nose" [...] grill has been adopted in the front fascia design.|$|R
50|$|A {{lightweight}} steel (not aluminium) {{structure and}} a rear-engined layout allowed Mitsubishi to incorporate a larger front crumple zone, {{in order to}} meet current safety legislation requirements without compromising interior space. With no powertrain in front of the driver, the designers were able to shorten the <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and lengthen the wheelbase to 2550 mm, giving greater legroom for passengers than many comparable kei cars whose wheelbase is typically 130 - 190 mm less. The downside of this design was a reduction in cargo-carrying capacity, which was necessarily compromised by the engine's location in the rear.|$|R
50|$|Being {{based on}} the MQB platform, the B8 Passat has more {{interior}} space than the last generation model despite being minimally shorter and 18 mm lower than the last generation model. As the front wheels have been moved forward, its wheelbase has been extended by 79 mm, resulting in a shorter <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> and a bigger cabin. The B8 Passat also weighs 73 kg less, due to the usage of lightweight vacuum-formed steel, and is only offered with turbocharger-equipped engines ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 litre to keep weight and fuel consumption as low as possible.|$|R
50|$|Rhodesian Railways {{specified}} a 6x2 {{version of}} the Worldmaster with Leyland-Albion non-reactive suspension for the rear bogie. By 1960 Leyland South Africa developed a {{version of the}} Worldmaster with front-vertical engine, but this was discontinued after the 1962 merger with AEC in favour of the stronger-selling AEC Kudu. Later the Guy Victory J and the Albion Clydesdale were available for this market sector. A notable use of Worldmaster units was in two BUT 9641T trolleybus chassis, formerly London Transport Q1 class vehicles, that the Santander Trolleybus company rebuilt to 11 m length with extended <b>front</b> <b>overhang.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, Alexander Dennis {{developed}} {{the new version}} of Trident 2 chassis for its Enviro400 double-decker. Marketed as the Enviro400 chassis, the name [...] "Trident 2" [...] continued {{to appear on the}} manufacturer's plate [...] and it retained the Cummins ISCe Euro III engine (soon replaced by Cummins ISBe 6-cylinder Euro IV) and Voith/ZF gearbox, it also received a number of modifications such as a longer <b>front</b> <b>overhang,</b> with a different shape of fuel tank became available. Production of the older version of Trident 2 chassis continued until 2006, with the newest example being delivered to Isle of Man Transport.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the second}} {{generation}} Honda Fit {{was introduced in the}} Japanese market in 2007, the first generation Fit was still sold in the North American market for the 2008 model year. The second generation Fit for the North American market was unveiled on 19 March 2008, at the 2008 New York International Auto Show for the 2009 model year. The North American Fit's <b>front</b> <b>overhang</b> is several inches longer to improve U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test ratings. The engine is a 1.5 L i-VTEC 4-cylinder with 117 horsepower at 6600 rpm mated to a five-speed manual transmission or a five-speed automatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|During {{the months}} {{following}} its introduction, sales were disappointing {{and the company}} rushed to produce an extensively face-lifted model. This appeared, with various styling changes and a modified range of engine options, in August 1968, {{less than a year}} after the P7’s introduction. To differentiate between the model produced before August 1968, and that produced between August 1968 and the end of 1971, the former is normally designated as the Ford P7a and the latter as the Ford P7b. The P7a had slightly different bodywork up front for the four-cylinder (17M) and six-cylinder (20M) models, with a 72 mm longer <b>front</b> <b>overhang.</b> The P7b did away with this barely noticeable distinction.|$|R
50|$|The Runabout was {{powered by}} the same engine as the Autobianchi A112.The Runabout {{featured}} a distinctive wedge shape and took many styling cues from contemporary power-boat design. Though the more extreme features of the Runabout such as the C pillar mounted headlights and the small wind-deflector windscreen were lost for the production car, many aesthetic features of the Autobianchi Runabout are readily identifiable on the X1/9. The long flat bonnet (hood) with central indentation, the large <b>front</b> <b>overhang,</b> the wedge shape with prominent C pillar roll-over hoop and the car-length indented plimsoll-line all made the successful transition to the X1/9, giving it a highly distinctive appearance.|$|R
50|$|Volvo B57 was a front-engined single-decker {{bus chassis}} {{manufactured}} by Volvo between 1966 and 1982. Since 1970 {{it was also}} available as the Volvo BB57, with the engine mounted {{on top of the}} front axle, giving the buses very little <b>front</b> <b>overhang.</b> The BB57 became a kind of replacement for the smaller B54, but as it was larger, the B54 got its true replacement later. The predecessor to BB57, the B615 had gone out of production in 1965, but apparently the demand for such a model was so high that they had to bring it back almost half a decade later, as the B54 proved to be too small.|$|R
