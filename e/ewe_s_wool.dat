On day 140 + 2 of pregnancy, the remaining 6 <b>ewes</b> (<b>S</b> 3) and 6 goats (G 3) were inoculated by stomach tube with 3000 oocysts. Positive T. godii DNA was detected in 94 % of fetal and maternal blood, 95 % fetal tissue, 89 % pre-colostral udder secretions and 12. 5 % milk samples using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Infected animals and their live newborns was seropositive (ELISA) {{until the end of the}} study. PCR was able to detect T. gondii DNA in maternal blood of infected animals 3 - 5 days before abortion occurred. This time period may be used to implement preventive and therapeutic measure to reduce abortion rate and associated economic losses. Since milk and milk products are important food sources in rural areas and in many cases it is used unpasteurized before consumption. The T. gondii DNA, detected by PCR in milk samples of infected animals, increases the possibility that the parasite is transmitted through consumption of unpasteurized milk which is a highly relevant result for public health considerations and providing valuable information for future research...|$|R

40|$|The U. <b>S.</b> <b>wool</b> {{industry}} has long received lower prices for comparable wool types {{than those of}} Australia. In order to better understand such price differences, economic evaluations of both the U. <b>S.</b> and Australian <b>wool</b> markets were conducted. This research focused on two primary objectives. The first objective was to determine what price differences existed between the Australian and U. <b>S.</b> <b>wool</b> markets and measure that difference. The second objective was to calculate price differences attributable to wool characteristics, {{as well as those}} resulting from regional, seasonal, and yearly differences. In order to accomplish the objectives, the study was set up into three different hedonic pricing models: U. S., Australian, and combined. In the U. S. model, there were significant price differences in season, year, region, level of preparation, and wool description. In addition, average fiber diameter (AFD) had a negative nonlinear relationship with price and lot weight had a positive linear relationship with price. The Australian model was notably different than the U. S. model in that there were only three variables. The yearly variable follows the same general pattern as the U. S. data but with a smaller span of difference. The seasonal price differences were distinctly different than the U. S. because of the difference in seasonal patterns. In addition, the AFD had a similar negative nonlinear relationship with price. The final model combines both the U. S. data and the Australian data. The combined model had only three variables: season, year, AFD and country. As {{in the case of the}} previous two models, AFD had the same negative nonlinear relationship and similar price elasticity. Overall, there was a - 30. 5 percent discount for U. <b>S.</b> <b>wool</b> when compared to Australian wool. This can be attributed to several different factors. One of which is that the Australian wool {{industry has}} a more extensive marketing scheme when compared to the U. <b>S</b> <b>wool</b> market as a whole. However, this is only a beginning to future research that needs to be conducted.

In order to achieve the purpose of this research, the choice experiment was applied to examine consumers' preferences for wool attributes. Both mail and on-line surveys were conducted. The mail survey included three versions: basic version, version with definitions of attributes, and version with both definitions and information about wool attributes, with ## responses received (a 29 percent response rate). The on-line survey contained the basic version and the version with both definitions and information about wool attributes, with 514 responses received. Conditional logit and multinomial logit models were used to examine willingness-to-pay for wool attributes and consumer segments, respectively. Results indicated that a certain portion of U. <b>S.</b> consumers preferred <b>wool</b> over acrylic products. Findings also suggested that it is likely beneficial for wool producers to differentiate their products by promoting products' attributes, such as organic, animal-friendly, and environment-friendly.

40|$|Glucose {{metabolism}} was {{studied in}} fed, starved and toxaemic ewes {{in the last}} month of gestation to ascertain causes of hypoglycaemia, and to determine whether the glucose metabolism of sheep susceptible to ovine pregnancy toxaemia (OPT) differs from those not susceptible. Glucose kinetics were measured with a single injection of [U- ¹⁴C], [6 -³H] glucose. Subsequently glucose tolerance tests were performed using 0. 4 g glucose/kg liveweight. Ewes were starved for 10 days to induce OPT, and blood samples were taken from one jugular vein and analysed for packed cell volume, glucose, ketones, free fatty acids, urea, creatinine, inorganic phosphate, total CO₂, total plasma protein and albumin. Glucose turnover was measured by a primed continuous infusion of [U -¹⁴C], [6 -³H] glucose when the <b>ewe</b> <b>s</b> became recumbent with OPT (and these were classified as susceptible, S) otherwise at the end of 10 days (and these were classified as non-susceptible, NS). The ewe was slaughtered {{at the end of the}} infusion. The caudate lobe of the maternal liver was removed, and perfused with collagenase to prepare hepatocytes for measuring the gluconeogenic potential of the liver. In another experiment, the effect of live foetuses on maternal glucose metabolism was assessed. Nooses were surgically implanted around the umbilical cords of foetuses in twin-pregnant ewes {{in the last month}} of gestation. Ten days after surgery, the ewes were starved for four days. Glucose turnover was measured by continuous infusion of [U-¹⁴C], [6 -³H] glucose and then the foetuses were killed by tightening the nooses. Blood samples were taken for 24 hours, to monitor glucose and acetoacetate concentrations. The ewe was then given a second infusion of tracer glucose, and subsequently killed for hepatocyte studies. A 5 -compartment model was proposed for glucose kinetics of fed, twin-pregnant ewes. Data of Sand NS ewes were compared by fitting to the model separately, using the SAAM program. Ewes susceptible to OPT had significantly higher insulin resistance (2043 µU/ml. min) than NS ewes (1261 µU/ml. min). This criterion could be useful in screening sheep for susceptibility before inducing the disease, and also provides evidence that OPT may be related to a poor ability to maintain glucose homeostasis. During starvation plasma glucose decreased, while ketones and free fatty acids increased. The final concentrations were related to the state of the lambs rather than OPT symptoms. Indications of renal failure (raised serum creatinine, urea and inorganic phosphate, and lowered total CO₂) were observed in both <b>S</b> and NS <b>ewes.</b> On post-mortem analysis, liver glycogen of <b>S</b> <b>ewes</b> was 10 % (2 mg/g) the level of NS ewes (18 mg/g). The gluconeogenic potential of hepatocytes from <b>S</b> <b>ewes,</b> with the substrates propionate, lactate, alanine, glutamine and glycerol, was significantly lower than that of NS ewes and the rates were not stimulated by glucagon. It is hypothesized that the development of OPT may be related to a lesion in glucose production. Ewes with dead lambs were often hyperglycaemic (plasma glucose greater than 80 mg/dl) had significantly higher glucose turnover rates (6. 90 g/kg/day) than those with live lambs (2. 67 g/kg/day), and had significantly higher gluconeogenic potentials, measured on hepatocytes. This suggested that the maternal glucose production was restricted by the presence of live foetuses. Killing the foetuses in utero raised plasma glucose (from 27 to 99 mg/dl), increased glucose turnover (from 2. 39 to 4. 82 g/kg/day) and significantly increased hepatocyte glucose production. It is hypothesized that the hypoglycaemia of starved pregnant ewes is due to inhibition of hepatic glucose production by some foetoplacental factor...|$|R
40|$|Background: Staphylococcus aureus {{is a major}} {{agent of}} {{mastitis}} in ruminants worldwide. Symptoms observed in <b>ewe</b> <b>S.</b> aureus intramammary infections (IMI) {{are very different from}} one case to another: IMI ranges from subclinical mastitis to lethal gangrenous mastitis. Neither the S. aureus nor the host - factors contributing to the different outcomes are known. Objectives: Identify differences between S. aureus strains implied in the acuteness of IMI. Methods: Two S. aureus strains isolated from subclinical mastitis (O 46) and gangrenous mastitis (O 11) were compared by using PFGE, MLST, Micro - array, spa type, s as type, SNP, MLVA type, and RAPD. Proteomic profiles of these strains were also compared. After growth in iron depleted RPMI with low oxygen, conditions that mimic IMI context, cell wall, cytoplasmic and secreted proteins were extracted and ran on 2 D gels. Results: O 11 and O 46 were genetically closely related. They had identical PFGE patterns (OV/OV', the main pattern in South East of France), were in the same MLST cluster. They shared 3615 identical targets using a pangenomic microarray. The core genes, the core variable genes, and the mobile genetic elements were essentially the same in both strains. The major differences were in spa type, sdrD, splE, fnbB, and the presence of the prophage genes (SAS 0897, SAR 1558, SAR 0940, SAR 2100, SACOL 0343). RAPD show ed the presence of an unknown gene SAB 1979 in O 11. Comparative proteomic revealed over secretion of some proteins (hlg, isdB,hly, lukF - PV, lukM, enolase) by O 11. Conclusions: Absence of a prophage as well as surface protein variants were associated with enhanced virulence. Differences can either be explained by over expression of some virulence factors. This study shows that IMI acuteness can partly be explained by strain genetic content. The impact of host factors on ewe susceptibility to IMIs still remains to be determined...|$|R

40|$|The United States sheep {{industry}} has suffered an almost constant decline in sheep and lamb inventories; {{a record of}} 56 million head in the early 1940 s to only 5. 54 million head in 2011. The steady decline of the industry {{can be attributed to}} a confluence of many factors, amongst which is the discontinuation of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Wool</b> Incentive payment program. With the discontinuation of the program in 1996 / 97, an unsuccessful effort was made to pass a mandatory checkoff program through a producer referendum. Six years later, in 2002, to enhance the demand for lamb, the Lamb Promotion, Research, and Information Order, better known as the American Lamb Checkoff Program, was established under the Commodity Promotion, Research and Information Act of 1996. The main objective of this research was to measure the effectiveness of the Lamb Checkoff Program by determining {{the extent to which the}} program has been able to shift out the demand for U. S. lamb and how much of the promotion benefit, if any, has been transmitted back through the supply chain to the different stakeholders of the lamb industry. This research investigated questions dealing with the demand, supply and trade of sheep and lamb through the global supply chain. This analysis used a seventy equation, non-spatial price equilibrium model to estimate the parameters of interest using the OLS method of estimation. After estimating the parameters, a simulation model was conducted over the sample period (1987 - 2011) as a means of validating the model. After validating the model using some within sample simulation statistics, the ?with? and ?without? lamb checkoff expenditure scenarios were developed to measure the effects and benefits of the program. The results of this study clearly indicated that not only did the lamb checkoff program increase the demand for lamb, the program tended to lift the entire supply chain in the process with every stakeholder group benefitting from it...|$|R
40|$|Four does (goat, G) {{and four}} <b>ewes</b> (sheep, <b>S)</b> of Jeneponto were fed chaffed rice straw hay (3. 7 %crude protein, 63. 5 % cell wall constituents, 44. 5 % acid {{detergent}} fiber and 6. 2 % acid detergent lignin,all based on dry matter). The intakes and digestibility {{of the diet}} by G and S were compared. Bothspecies consumed {{the same level of}} the diet. G digested dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, crudefiber, and lignin of the diet to a significant higher extent than did by S. The superiority of G over S indigesting the diet was attributable with longer retention time of ruminal fluid and particulate matters inthe rumen and the entire gut, which then resulted in higher proportion of small size particles (< 1 mmsieve), higher proportions of propionic, butyric, valeric and isovaleric acid concentrations produced inthe rumen. Additionally for further studies, there were some possibilities of G having a better chewingactivity (duration and intensity), and ability to maintain higher rumen ammonia levels by a greater urearecycle to the rumen, particularly through salivation...|$|R
40|$|Cotton is the “natural” Choice and the {{dominating}} {{material in}} bed linen and sleepwear in Norway {{as in many}} other European countries. Regulation of temperature and humidity are important for good sleep, but they are not cotton’s strong points. There must have been other than the functional reasons which made cotton the winner in the bedding market. This article builds on literature about bedding in Norway from the 1800 s and survey questions from 1951. We ask the question: what materials have been used and why? Wool was used in all bed textiles, both closest to the body and the layers over and under, from the cheapest chopped rags to the most costly textiles. The decline was seen throughout the 1800 and 1900 s, but only in the 1960 <b>s</b> does <b>wool</b> become totally absent as a next to skin bed textile.

40|$|Between the 1880 s and 1930 <b>s</b> the {{international}} <b>wool</b> auction market shifted decisively from Britain to Australia. A series of historical developments altered the efficiency {{criteria for the}} existing institutional arrangements, notably the growing international dominance of Australian wool production, {{the evolution of the}} small grazier, the geographical diversification of demand, and improved international transport and communications. Central to this market shift was the role of large pastoral agent firms based in Australia who employed their local knowledge, producer contacts, and trade specialisation to reduce costs. Australian graziers benefited from local market signals and quicker sale realisation. Overseas buyers increasingly came from outside Britain, and their contacts with Australia were aided by much improved long distance shipping and telegram communications. ...|$|R

40|$|The ambient {{photoperiod}} {{was recorded}} over an 8 -yr period {{at the beginning}} and end of the breeding season in a flock of Suffolk ewes maintained outdoors. The transition into the breeding season in this short-day breeder occurred at a day length which was much longer (14. 0 h, Sept. 3 ± 5 days) than that at the onset of anestrus (11. 5 h, Feb. 15 ± 3 days). This produced a marked asymmetry of the annual cycles of photoperiod and reproduction. In an attempt to explain this asymmetry, we determined if ewes enter anestrus because increasing day lengths curtail bre-eding or because ewes lose the ability to respond to prevailing short day lengths (i. e., become photorefractory). On the winter solstice, 3 groups of 6 ovariectomized <b>ewes</b> bearing <b>s.</b> c. Silastic implants of estradiol were placed on different day length treatments: 1) natural environment; 2) artificial day length which simulated natural photoperiod; or 3) artificial day length equivalent to that of the winter solstice (1 OL). Transition into anestrus was determined from the precipitous drop in serum Iuteininzing hormone (LH) concentrations. The breeding season was not prolonged in ewes held on the winter solstice day length; LH did not remain elevated beyond the time ihat it plummeted in the other groups. These findings lead to the conclusion that Suffolk ewes normally cease breeding, not because they are actively inhibited by increasing day lengths, but because they become photorefractory. This can account, at least in part, for the asymmetry between the annual cycle of photoperiod and reproduction in this short-day breeder...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to localize the central sites of action of melatonin involved in the control of seasonal reproduction. Ewes were exposed to long days and received microimplants of melatonin in the preoptic area (n = 9), anterior hypothalamus (n = 4), dorsolateral hypothalamus (n = 4), or mediobasal hypothalamus (n = 12). The effects of implants were determined by comparison with control ewes (untreated or sham-operated, n = 10) and with ewes treated with an s. c. implant of melatonin (n = 8) or ewes subjected to short days (n = 8). All ewes were ovariectomized and treated s. c. with a silastic capsule of estradiol. Melatonin released in the preoptic area {{as well as in}} the anterior and lateral hypothalamus did not cause any difference as compared with the controls (no stimulation of LH secretion and no inhibition of prolactin secretion). In contrast, melatonin implanted in the mediobasal hypothalamus caused an increase in LH secretion in 7 of the 12 ewes on Day 53. 0 4. 2 after implantation (mean ± SEM). Their response was not different compared with that of <b>ewes</b> treated <b>s.</b> c. with melatonin or exposed to short days either in terms of timing (Day 56. 3 6. 2 and 59. 5 3. 1, respectively, for controls) or of amplitude of the LH response. Similarly, melatonin caused only a reduction of prolactin secretion in the mediobasal, s. c., and short-day groups. It is concluded that the mediobasal hypothalamus or the surrounding tissues could be the sites of action of melatonin involved in the control of seasonal reproduction...|$|R
