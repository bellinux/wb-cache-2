40|$|Abstract Background Long-term acetate supplementation reduces neuroglial {{activation}} and cholinergic cell loss in a rat {{model of}} lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation. Additionally, a single dose of <b>glyceryl</b> <b>triacetate,</b> used to induce acetate supplementation, increases histone H 3 and H 4 acetylation and inhibits histone deacetylase activity and histone deacetylase- 2 expression in normal rat brain. Here, we {{propose that the}} therapeutic effect of acetate in reducing neuroglial activation {{is due to a}} reversal of lipopolysaccharide-induced changes in histone acetylation and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Methods In this study, we examined the effect of a 28 -day-dosing regimen of <b>glyceryl</b> <b>triacetate,</b> to induce acetate supplementation, on brain histone acetylation and interleukin- 1 β expression in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation. The effect was analyzed using Western blot analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and enzymic histone deacetylase and histone acetyltransferase assays. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance, parametric or nonparametric when appropriate, followed by Tukey's or Dunn's post-hoc test, respectively. Results We found that long-term acetate supplementation increased the proportion of brain histone H 3 acetylated at lysine 9 (H 3 K 9), histone H 4 acetylated at lysine 8 and histone H 4 acetylated at lysine 16. However, unlike a single dose of <b>glyceryl</b> <b>triacetate,</b> long-term treatment increased histone acetyltransferase activity and had no effect on histone deacetylase activity, with variable effects on brain histone deacetylase class I and II expression. In agreement with this hypothesis, neuroinflammation reduced the proportion of brain H 3 K 9 acetylation by 50 %, which was effectively reversed with acetate supplementation. Further, in rats subjected to lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 1 β protein and mRNA levels were increased by 1. 3 - and 10 -fold, respectively, and acetate supplementation reduced this expression to control levels. Conclusion Based on these results, we conclude that dietary acetate supplementation attenuates neuroglial activation by effectively reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by a mechanism that may involve a distinct site-specific pattern of histone acetylation and histone deacetylase expression in the brain. </p...|$|E

Conventionally, the development of ceramic tape-casting slurries is time-consuming and of low efficiency. In this work, combinatorial approaches were applied to screen the ethanol and ethyl-acetate binary solvent based slurry for ceramic green tape-casting. The combinatorial libraries were designed considering the variation of the amount of PVB (Poly vinyl-butyral) binder, polyethylene- 400, and butyl-benzyl-phthalate plasticizers, and <b>glyceryl</b> <b>triacetate</b> dispersant. A parallel magnetic stirring process was used to make the combinatorial slurry library. The properties mapping of the slurry library was obtained by investigating the sedimentation and rheological characteristics of the slurries. The slurry composition was refined by scaling up the experiments and comparing the microstructure, mechanical property, and sintering behavior of green tapes made from the selected slurries. Finally, a kind of ethanol-ethyl acetate binary solvent based slurry system suitable for making X 7 R dielectric ceramic green tapes was achieved. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|E

To enhance their toughness, while preserving an optimal stiffness, selected low molecular weight plasticizers (bis(2 -ethylhexyl) adipate and <b>glyceryl</b> <b>triacetate)</b> and polymeric adipates with different molecular weights have been mixed with a specific PLA (L/D isomer ratio of 96 / 4) and 40 wt% of AII using an internal kneader. Addition of up to 10 wt% plasticizer into these highly filled compositions can trigger a fourfold increase of the impact strength with respect to the compositions without any modifier, cold crystallization properties and a significant decrease of their glass transition temperature. Moreover, these ternary compositions (PLA–AII–plasticizer) are clearly characterized by easier processing, notable thermo-mechanical performances and good filler dispersion.

40|$|The {{importance}} of localised delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs for cancer treatment and specifically solid tumours {{has been widely}} reported. In this study, the anticancer drug N 4 -myristoyl gemcitabine (a lipophilic form of gemcitabine) was formulated as organogel to achieve a localised depot delivery. Thus, the first goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the suitability of the oragnogel for intartumoural injection and this attained by investigating the thermostability and elasticity of the organogel. Further to this, the second goal was to slow the release of N 4 -myristoyl gemcitabine from the organogel. Accomplishment of these two goals will guarantee a better efficacy of cancer treatment by obtaining direct contact of the organogel containing the N 4 -myristoyl gemcitabine with the cancerous cells. The studies herein selected the 12 -hydroxystearic acid (12 -HSA) as the gelator and using 2 types of solvents the liquid part of the organogel. The first type of solvent was a series of oils which were soybean oil (SO), medium chain triglyceride (MCT), glyceryl tributyrate (TGB) and <b>glyceryl</b> <b>triacetate</b> (GTA) whilst, the second type of solvent was propylene glycol (PG).

40|$|Cancer is {{associated}} with globally hypoacetylated chromatin and considerable attention has recently been focused on epigenetic therapies. N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA), the primary storage form of acetate in the brain, and aspartoacylase (ASPA), the enzyme responsible for NAA catalysis to generate acetate and ultimately acetyl-Coenzyme A for histone acetylation, are reduced in oligodendroglioma. The short chain triglyceride <b>glyceryl</b> <b>triacetate</b> (GTA), which increases histone acetylation and inhibits histone deacetylase expression, has been safely used for acetate supplementation in Canavan disease, a leukodystrophy due to ASPA mutation. We demonstrate that GTA induces cytostatic G 0 growth arrest of oligodendroglioma-derived cells in vitro, without affecting normal cells. Sodium acetate, at doses comparable to that generated by complete GTA catalysis, but not glycerol also promoted growth arrest, whereas long chain triglycerides promoted cell growth. To begin to elucidate its mechanism of action, the effects of GTA on ASPA and acetyl-CoA synthetase protein levels and differentiation of established human oligodendroglioma cells (HOG and Hs 683) and primary tumor-derived oligodendroglioma cells that exhibit some features of cancer stem cells (grade II OG 33 and grade III OG 35) relative to an oligodendrocyte progenitor line (Oli-Neu) were examined.

40|$|Polylactide (PLA) is an {{attractive}} candidate for replacing petrochemical polymers because it is biodegradable and produced from annually renewable resources. Characterized by high tensile strength, unfortunately the brittleness and rigidity of PLA limit its applicability. For {{a great number of}} applications such as packaging, fibers, films, etc., it is of high interest to formulate new grades with improved flexibility and better impact properties. In this objective, a specific PLA grade (L/D isomer ratio of 96 : 4, high molecular weight) was melt-mixed with selected plasticizers: bis(2 -ethylhexyl) adipate (DOA), <b>glyceryl</b> <b>triacetate</b> (GTA), and tributyl O-acetylcitrate (TBAC). Their effect on the molecular, thermal, and mechanical properties of PLA was investigated for content up to 20 wt% plasticizer and the results were correlated with a particular attention to the relationship between property and application. Using the solubility and interaction parameters, a tentative evaluation of the product that could act as the most effective plasticizer for PLA has been performed and the obtained results have been corroborated with the materials physical properties. Excellent mechanical performances were obtained using the plasticizer having the lowest molecular mass (GTA) and the best interaction parameter. In relation to plasticizer amount/nature, the glass transition temperature of PLA (62 -C) is decreased by plasticizing by more than 30 -C, whereas better impact properties and lower stiffness are measured. The optimal formulations targeted to the final applications are clearly characterized by specific end-use properties: improved crystallization rates (PLA-DOA); high elongation at break and tensile strength (PLA-GTA, PLA-TBAC), medium to high impact properties (PLA-DOA, PLA-GTA) compositions.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that prebiotics (dietary fibres that augment {{the growth of}} indigenous beneficial gut bacteria) such as BimunoTM galacto-oligosaccharides (B-GOS®), increased N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor levels in the rat brain. The current investigation examined the functional correlates of these changes in B-GOS®-fed rats by measuring cortical neuronal responses to NMDA using in vivo NMDA micro-iontophoresis electrophysiology, and performance in the attentional set-shifting task. Adult male rats were supplemented with B-GOS® in the drinking water 3 weeks prior to in vivo iontophoresis or behavioural testing. Cortical neuronal responses to NMDA iontophoresis, were greater (+ 30 %) in B-GOS® administered rats compared to non-supplemented controls. The intake of B-GOS® also partially hindered the reduction of NMDA responses by the glycine site antagonist, HA- 966. In the attentional set-shifting task, B-GOS® -fed rats shifted from an intra-dimensional to an extra-dimensional set in fewer trials than controls, thereby indicating greater cognitive flexibility. An initial exploration into the mechanisms revealed that rats ingesting B-GOS® had increased levels of plasma acetate, and cortical GluN 2 B subunits and Acetyl Co-A Carboxylase mRNA. These changes were also observed in rats fed daily for 3 weeks with <b>glyceryl</b> <b>triacetate,</b> though unlike B-GOS®, cortical histone deacetylase (HDAC 1, HDAC 2) mRNAs were also increased which suggested an additional epigenetic action of direct acetate supplementation.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{have found}} that acetate supplementation {{significantly}} reduces neuroglia activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release in a rat model of neuroinflammation induced with lipopolysaccharide. To test if the anti-inflammatory effect of acetate supplementation is specific to a TLR 4 -mediated injury, we measured markers of neuroglia activation in rats subjected to B. burgdorferi -induced neuroborreliosis that is mediated {{in large part by}} a TLR 2 -type mechanism. Methods In this study, rats were subjected to Lyme neuroborreliosis following an intravenous infusion of B. burgdorferi (B 31 -MI- 16). Acetate supplementation was induced using <b>glyceryl</b> <b>triacetate</b> (6 g/kg) by oral gavage. Immunohistochemistry, qPCR, and western blot analyses were used to measure bacterial invasion into the brain, neuroglial activation, and brain and circulating levels of interleukin 1 β. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Tukey’s post hoc tests or using a Student’s t test assuming unequal variances when appropriate. Results We found that acetate supplementation significantly reduced microglia activation by 2 -fold as determined by immunohistochemical and western blot analysis. Further, acetate supplementation also reduced the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 1 β by 2 -fold as compared to controls. On the other hand, the inoculation of rats with B. burgdorferi had no effect on astroglial activation as determined by immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis despite significant increases in circulation levels of antigen toward B. burgdorferi and presence of the bacteria in the central nervous system. Conclusions These results suggest that microglial activation is an essential component to neuroborreliosis and that acetate supplementation may be an effective treatment to reduce injury phenotype and possibly injury progression in Lyme neuroborreliosis. </p...|$|E

Under the optimal condition, the protein loading yielded of 14. 7 mg/g NH 2 -nano-SnO 2, while the adsorption capacity of the unmodified nano-SnO 2 for the same enzyme was 38. 5 mg/g. At the same time, NH 2 -nano-SnO 2 -RhD exhibited specific hydrolytic activity of 77. 6 U/mg prot. which is 2. 5 -fold higher in comparison to that of the physically adsorbed on nano-SnO 2 lipase (nano-SnO 2 -RhD). In ten reaction cycles of tributyrin hydrolysis, up to 70 % of the activity of NH 2 -nano-SnO 2 -RhD was preserved. Upon immobilization the enantioselectivity of the lipase for the reaction of acylation of (±) -menthol was improved. For the two biocatalysts, the highest yield of (−) -menthyl acetate (more than 35 %) was obtained when <b>glyceryl</b> <b>triacetate</b> was used as acylating reagent, however, the enantiomeric excess was only 89. 5 % for the covalently bonded lipase and 85. 0 % for the physically adsorbed one.

40|$|Noninvasive glucose {{monitoring}} {{has been}} the subject of considerable research because of the high number of diabetes patients who must monitor their glucose levels daily by taking blood samples. Among methods being evaluated for possible use in this application, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has received significant attention because of available glucose absorption bands that can be observed in the presence of the large aqueous background found in tissue spectra. The objective of the research presented here is to evaluate the potential for implementing a noninvasive nocturnal hypoglycemic alarm with NIR spectroscopy. Such an alarm would be used by a diabetic to detect potentially dangerous occurrences of hypoglycemia during sleep. The approach used is to collect spectra continuously from the patient during the sleep period, followed by the application of pattern recognition methods to determine if a spectrum represents a blood glucose level that exceeds a hypoglycemic threshold. A reference spectrum is collected and a conventional finger-stick glucose concentration measurement is made at the start of the sleep period. The ratio is then taken of each subsequent spectrum to the collected reference, forming a differential spectrum corresponding to the signed difference in concentration relative to the reference. The identification of these differential spectra as 2 ̆ 2 alarm 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 non-alarm 2 ̆ 2 is performed with a classification model computed with piecewise linear discriminant analysis. This methodology is initially tested with in vitro laboratory data that simulated the glucose excursions that occur during sleep. The performance of the hypoglycemic alarm methodology in the presence of varying levels of urea, <b>glyceryl</b> <b>triacetate,</b> and L-lactate as potential spectral interferents is tested. The robustness of the methodology with respect to time is also evaluated. The thesis further discusses an experimental procedure to prepare tissue phantoms composed of two main proteins that exist in human skin tissue, keratin and collagen. A new methodology is developed to produce varying-thickness films that allowed the simulation of changes in the content of skin tissue proteins present within the optical path of the NIR measurement. The prepared films are incorporated into in vitro laboratory measurements in which varying levels of glucose, urea, keratin, and collagen are introduced in order to provide a test of the hypoglycemic alarm algorithm that simulates the spectral properties of human tissue. Finally, the hypoglycemic alarm algorithm is tested with in vivo data collected with rat animal models. Data are presented for single-day experiments performed with anesthetized rats, as well as for multiple-day experiments conducted with awake rats. The results obtained from both the in vitro and in vivo studies confirm that if high-quality spectral data are attainable, the alarm methodology can work effectively to identify hypoglycemic events while exhibiting a low rate of false detections...|$|E
