500|$|A bypass of Clackline {{was also}} constructed, {{realigning}} [...] of Great Eastern Highway [...] {{north of the}} town. Works began in January 2007, and were completed in February 2008. The project also involved constructing overtaking lanes between Clackline and Bakers Hill, upgrading intersections in Clackline, and constructing a pedestrian underpass for a heritage trail. Clackline Brook was realigned through a large box culvert, allowing a safer crossing than the narrow Clackline Bridge on the original alignment. The bypass was originally allocated $2.4million of funding in 2006, but by January 2007 it was expected to cost almost $11million. The final project value was $9.2million. <b>Issues</b> <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> in the project's design and construction included extensive rock protection requirements for the Clackline Brook culvert, drilling and blasting close to the existing highway, and protecting heritage and environmentally sensitive areas. The Clackline community welcomed the bypass, but there were concerns that the historic Clackline Bridge would be lost. The bridge has since received a permanent entry on the Heritage Council of Western Australia's Register of Heritage Places, in November 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Recollection is the fiction-writing mode whereby a {{character}} remembers a detail or event. It plays {{a vital role}} in conveying backstory by allowing writers to convey information from earlier in the story or from before the beginning of the story. [...] Although recollection is not widely recognized as a distinct mode of fiction-writing, it is a common tool. [...] Recollection could be considered a subset of introspection, but its role in developing backstory separates it from the other thoughts of {{a character}}. [...] Effective presentation of recollection has its own unique <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> <b>challenges.</b> [...] For example, timing a recollection to avoid implausible-seeming memories (such as when a character must make a key decision) can be difficult, and should be prompted by a recent plot event.|$|E
2500|$|Work coauthored by Valeria Rueda {{studied the}} {{long-term}} {{consequences of the}} introduction of printing presses {{on the development of}} media in different African countries. [...] They studied the impact of protestant missions in Africa based on their locations in 1903, some of which had their own printing presses to print bibles and educational materials. [...] Cagé and Rueda found that “within regions close to missions, proximity to a printing press is associated with higher newspaper readership, trust, education, and political participation.” [...] They also noted that missions without printing presses failed to show comparable improvements. [...] This extended her 2014 analysis of specific <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> encountered in development specific to Africa, noting that this process in Africa may have been different from the comparable experience in other regions of the world.|$|E
2500|$|International Men's Day {{was inaugurated}} in Botswana in 2011 by {{coordinator}} Geneuvieve Twala. One of the International Men's Day themes promoted {{was to help}} foster youth to unlock their creative identities {{to allow them to}} share their gifts with peers, family and the community, and to be seen and heard for who they are and not how they are perceived. The primary event was a gala dinner titled [...] "One moment for Change" [...] to highlight men's potential and the increasing capabilities of men as innovators of society. The dinner was held to raise funds to cover six months music tuition fees for a group of 20 children from the SOS Children's Village whom IMD ambassadors have adopted as part of a mentoring programme for children. Standard Chartered Bank sponsored the dinner, which included a range of iconic speakers who shared their experience and insights with the audience. Standard Chartered Bank Acting CEO Mr Michael Wiegand opened the event by sharing best practices that Standard Chartered Bank uses to address legitimate issues faced by male employees, including the fact that Standard Chartered Bank is the first company in Botswana to offer paternity leave which, he stated, made their male employees feel valued and that they were working for a 21st-century organization. Mr Tebogo Sebego, senior partner at Sebego & Sharma Attorneys and former chairperson of the Law Society of Botswana gave a keynote speech where he emphasized how the child protection laws should be improved, how the society play a role in creating a safe environment for the future generation of men. Mrs Tjipo Mothobi, Director, GBC Health South Africa gave an address on business collective effort. The District Commissioner in his closing remarks made an announcement that by end of December he was convening a meeting with men in the City where they will engage in dialogue on how they can collectively address the <b>issues</b> <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> men and boys face. The inaugural event was a success, with radio stations subsequently airing programmes that call for debate on men's issues since IMD. All the businesses and stakeholders involved gave a commitment to be {{part and parcel of the}} next IMD and we are already working on the strategy for 2012.|$|E
