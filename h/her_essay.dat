5|$|Homer {{takes an}} {{interest}} in the Reading Digest magazine after a copy is sent to the Simpson family's residence. In the magazine, he notices an ad for a children's contest in which an essay must be written about what makes America great. Lisa chooses to enter, takes a trip to Springfield Forest, and is inspired to write <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> when she sees the forest's natural beauty and when an eagle lands right by the branch she is sitting under. Lisa's article is approved for entry in the national finals in Washington, D.C. after the contest judge observes Homer's poor vocabulary and realizes that he could not have written Lisa's essay for her.|$|E
25|$|In 1901 Gippius and Merezhkovsky co-founded the Religious and Philosophical Meetings. This 'gathering {{for free}} discussion', {{focusing}} on the synthesis of culture and religion, brought together {{an eclectic mix of}} intellectuals and was regarded in retrospect as an important, if short-lived attempt to pull Russia back from the major social upheavals it was headed for. Gippius was {{the driving force behind the}} Meetings, as well as the magazine Novy Put (1903–04), launched initially as a vehicle for the former. By the time Novy Put folded (due to a conflict caused by the newcomer Sergei Bulgakov's refusal to publish <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> on Alexander Blok), Gippius (as Anton Krainy) had become a prominent literary critic, contributing mostly to Vesy (Scales).|$|E
25|$|Semiotics {{operates}} {{under the}} theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even {{to the extent that}} an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it. Rosalind Krauss espoused this concept in <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. Mieke Bal argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.|$|E

500|$|The poena cullei was {{eliminated}} as the punishment for parricides within the Byzantine Empire {{in the law}} code Basilika, promulgated more than 300 years after the times of Justinian, around 892 CE.

Doll suggests that both Ovid's and Proulx' main concerns are civilization and its discontents and that their use of images of nature uncovers similar understandings of what is [...] "natural" [...] {{when it comes to}} who and how one should love.

500|$|Isabel Alvarez Borland, in <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> [...] "The Task of the Historian in [...] ", {{claims that}} [...] " ...while [...] {{is in many}} ways a {{continuation}} of García Márquez's criticism of Latin America's official history seen in his earlier works, the novel contrasts sharply with his previous fictions". In Chronicle of a Death Foretold, according to Alvarez Borland, the narrator challenges the truth of official language. However, The General in His Labyrinth [...] "differs from these earlier works in employing narrative strategies which seek to answer in a much more overt and didactic fashion questions that the novel poses about history".|$|E

500|$|Goldman {{was also}} a passionate critic of the prison system, critiquing both the {{treatment}} of prisoners and the social causes of crime. Goldman viewed crime as a natural outgrowth of an unjust economic system, and in <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> [...] "Prisons: A Social Crime and Failure", she quoted liberally from the 19th-century authors Fyodor Dostoevsky and Oscar Wilde on prisons, and wrote: Year after year the gates of prison hells return to the world an emaciated, deformed, will-less, shipwrecked crew of humanity, with the Cain mark on their foreheads, their hopes crushed, all their natural inclinations thwarted. With nothing but hunger and inhumanity to greet them, these victims soon sink back into crime as the only possibility of existence.|$|E
500|$|Many artists also {{traveled}} to the third notch, Franconia Notch, to paint. [...] A rivalry developed between the Franconia artists and the North Conway artists. [...] Each faction believed that their location had the most beautiful view of the mountains. [...] Those who preferred Franconia felt that North Conway, as early as 1857, had been overrun by tourists. [...] Barbara J. MacAdam, in <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> [...] "A Proper Distance from the Hills," [...] stated: [...] "To meet this growing demand , railroad lines were extended and new hotels constructed on a grand scale. [...] In the process, those qualities that had drawn artists to North Conway {{in the first place}} became endangered." [...] Daniel Huntington (18161906), writing from West Campton in 1855, described the appeal of the Franconia region to the landscape painter.|$|E
500|$|Donaldson, in <b>her</b> <b>essay</b> [...] "The Last Temptation of Mulder", {{writes that}} in Kazantzakis' novel Jesus [...] "represents {{what is the}} utmost human challenge, that of {{releasing}} the divinity within from its earthly confines." [...] In this way, the Jesus of The Last Temptation of Christ represents [...] "utter humanity" [...] and the [...] "struggle between {{the spirit and the}} flesh". Mulder is similarly challenged when he is enticed by The Smoking Man, and overcomes temptation by giving up his dream life and embracing his destiny to stop the alien invasion. Several characters in the episode resemble those in the novel. For instance, Fowley is similar to Kazantzakis' version of Mary Magdalene—both characters [...] "thwart the mission" [...] of the hero. Scully parallels Kazantzakis' version of Judas Iscariot, as they both call the heroes out of their respective trances.|$|E
