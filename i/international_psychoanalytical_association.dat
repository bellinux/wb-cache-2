25|$|In 1953, after a {{disagreement}} over the variable-length session, Lacan {{and many of}} his colleagues left the Société Parisienne de Psychanalyse to form a new group, the Société Française de Psychanalyse (SFP).

25|$|Jung {{was thirty}} {{when he sent}} his Studies in Word Association to Sigmund Freud in Vienna in 1906. The two men {{met for the first}} time the {{following}} year and Jung recalled the discussion between himself and Freud as interminable. He recalled that they talked almost unceasingly for thirteen hours. Six months later, the then 50-year-old Freud sent a collection of his latest published essays to Jung in Zurich. This marked the beginning of an intense correspondence and collaboration that lasted six years and ended in May 1913. At that time Jung resigned as the chairman of the <b>International</b> <b>Psychoanalytical</b> <b>Association,</b> a position to which he had been elected with Freud's support.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{undertook}} {{an intensive}} programme {{of writing and}} research, which produced {{the first of what}} were to be many significant contributions to psychoanalytic literature, notably monographs on Hamlet and On the Nightmare. A number of these were published in German in the main psychoanalytic periodicals published in Vienna; these secured his status in Freud's inner circle during the period of the latter's increasing estrangement from Jung. In this context in 1912 Jones initiated, with Freud's agreement, the formation of a Committee of loyalists charged with safeguarding the theoretical and institutional legacy of the psychoanalytic movement. This development also served the more immediate purpose of isolating Jung and, with Jones in strategic control, eventually manoeuvring him out of the Presidency of the <b>International</b> <b>Psychoanalytical</b> <b>Association,</b> a post he had held since its inception. When Jung's resignation came in 1914, it was only the outbreak of the Great War that prevented Jones from taking his place.|$|E
25|$|Jung and Freud {{personally}} met for {{the last}} time in September 1913 for the Fourth <b>International</b> <b>Psychoanalytical</b> Congress in Munich.

25|$|Freud {{continued}} {{to maintain his}} optimistic underestimation of the growing Nazi threat and remained determined to stay in Vienna, even following the Anschluss of 13 March 1938, in which Nazi Germany annexed Austria, and the outbreaks of violent anti-Semitism that ensued. Ernest Jones, the then president of the <b>International</b> <b>Psychoanalytical</b> <b>Association</b> (IPA), flew into Vienna from London via Prague on 15 March determined to get Freud {{to change his mind}} and seek exile in Britain. This prospect and the shock of the detention and interrogation of Anna Freud by the Gestapo finally convinced Freud {{it was time to leave}} Austria. Jones left for London the following week with a list provided by Freud of the party of émigrés for whom immigration permits would be required. Back in London, Jones used his personal acquaintance with the Home Secretary, Sir Samuel Hoare, to expedite the granting of permits. There were seventeen in all and work permits were provided where relevant. Jones also used his influence in scientific circles, persuading the president of the Royal Society, Sir William Bragg, to write to the Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, requesting to good effect that diplomatic pressure be applied in Berlin and Vienna on Freud's behalf. Freud also had support from American diplomats, notably his ex-patient and American ambassador to France, William Bullitt.|$|E

2500|$|Alfred Ernest Jones [...] (1 January 1879 – 11 February 1958) was a Welsh {{neurologist}} and psychoanalyst. A lifelong {{friend and}} colleague of Sigmund Freud from their first meeting in 1908, he became his official biographer. Jones was the first English-speaking practitioner of psychoanalysis and became its leading exponent in the English-speaking world. As President of both the <b>International</b> <b>Psychoanalytical</b> <b>Association</b> and the British Psycho-Analytical Society in the 1920s and 1930s, Jones exercised a formative influence {{in the establishment of}} their organisations, institutions and publications.|$|E
2500|$|Bela Grunberger and Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel {{were two}} psychoanalysts from the Paris {{section of the}} <b>International</b> <b>Psychoanalytical</b> <b>Association.</b> In November 1968 they {{disguised}} themselves under the pseudonym André Stéphane and published L’univers Contestationnaire, in which they argued that the left-wing rioters of May 68 were totalitarian stalinists, and proceeded to psychoanalyze them as suffering from a sordid infantilism caught up in an Oedipal revolt against the Father. Jacques Lacan regarded Grunberger and Chasseguet-Smirgel's book with great disdain; {{while they were still}} disguised under the pseudonym, Lacan remarked that he was certain that neither author belonged to his school, as none would abase themselves to such low drivel. The IPa analysts responded with an accusation against the Lacan school of [...] "intellectual terrorism." [...] Gérard Mendel published La révolte contre le père (1968) and Pour décoloniser l’enfant (1971).|$|E
2500|$|In 1920 she {{attended}} the sixth {{congress of the}} <b>International</b> <b>Psychoanalytical</b> <b>Association</b> in The Hague, where she gave a talk {{on the origins of}} language in childhood. The audience included Sigmund Freud, his daughter Anna Freud, Melanie Klein and Sandor Ferenczi. She also announced her intention to join the staff of the Rousseau Institute in Geneva, a pioneering clinical, training and research centre for child development in Geneva. She remained there for three years, working alongside its founder Édouard Claparède, as well as other distinguished psychologists of the time including Pierre Bovet. While she was there, Jean Piaget also joined the staff: they collaborated closely, and in 1921 he went into an eight-month analysis with her. In 1922, She and Piaget both delivered papers at the seventh congress of the <b>International</b> <b>Psychoanalytical</b> <b>Association</b> in Berlin. This {{was one of the most}} productive periods of her life, and she published twenty papers between 1920 and 1923. The most important of these was a new version of the paper she had given at the Hague on the origins of language, drawing on her collaboration with the linguist Charles Bally. Entitled [...] "The origins of the words 'Papa' and 'Mama'", she described how language develops on a substrate of genetic readiness, first through interactions between the child and the mother's breast, and then through family and social interactions. Her other papers from the time are mainly devoted to bring psychoanalytic thought together with observational studies of child development,. Her papers in the Zeitschrift and Imago from this time mainly focus on the importance of speech acquisition in early childhood and the sense of time. However, Otto Fenichel singled out for special mention her 1923 article on voyeurism, where “Sabina Spielrein described a peeping perversion in which the patient tried to overcome an early repression of genital and manual erotogeneity, provoked by an intense castration fear”. Overall, her work during this period is thought to have had considerable influence on Piaget's thought, and possibly on Klein's.|$|E
5000|$|The {{major problem}} that had however faced the new Society {{from the start}} was that of obtaining {{recognition}} from the <b>International</b> <b>Psychoanalytical</b> Association; and here Lacan increasingly appeared as the main obstacle to success. Although both men had been analysed by Loewenstein, Lacan unlike Lagache had reacted violently against his ego psychology, and by 1961 he was publicly attacking Lagache for [...] "personalism" [...] due to the latter's mix of psychology and psychoanalysis.|$|R
5000|$|An active socialist {{dedicated}} {{to making the}} arts accessible to the working classes, it was D.J. Bach who instituted the Arbeiter-Symphonie-Konzerte ('Workers' Symphony Concerts') in Vienna in 1905. His wide-ranging activities earned him the hostility of right-wing groups, who denounced his artistic programme {{as part of a}} 'Jewish conspiracy' to undermine traditional Austrian culture. Such accusations were all the more vehement because D.J. Bach {{was also one of the}} earliest members of the Vienna <b>Psychoanalytical</b> <b>Association</b> which met under the aegis of Sigmund Freud and whose members were mostly Jewish.|$|R
5000|$|Whereas Freud {{proposed}} that father (the paternal phallus) {{was central to}} infantile and adult psychosexual development, Melanie Klein concentrated upon the early maternal relationship, proposing that Oedipal manifestations are perceptible {{in the first year}} of life, the oral stage. Her proposal was part of the Controversial discussions (1942-44) at the British <b>Psychoanalytical</b> <b>Association.</b> The Kleinian psychologists {{proposed that}} [...] "underlying the Oedipus complex, as Freud described it ... there is an earlier layer of more primitive relationships with the Oedipal couple". Moreover, Klein's work lessened the central role of the Oedipus complex, with the concept of the depressive position.|$|R

5000|$|Based on Lacan's {{criticism}} and its developments in France within Paris Psychoanalytic Society and French <b>Psychoanalytical</b> <b>Association,</b> the <b>International</b> Psychoanalytic Association included new training models, like the French and the Uruguayan models, {{added to the}} traditional Eitingon model of the [...] "Training analysis" [...] (introduced by Max Eitingon in the early twenties). The French model, making no distinction between training analysis and therapeutic analysis, is a model in which the personal psychoanalysis is mostly independent from the institututional application of the candidate, and therefore takes place prior to the institutional training. The training in Paris Psychoanalytic Society shows a typical example of this model.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, Lacan {{proposed}} that the mirror stage {{was part of an}} infant's development from 6 to 18 months, as outlined at the Fourteenth <b>International</b> <b>Psychoanalytical</b> Congress at Marienbad in 1936.
