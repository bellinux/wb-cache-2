40|$|Notwithstanding {{the troubled}} past and {{uncertain}} future of {{its relations with}} the European Union (EU), Turkey persists in its bid for membership in the EU. What accounts for Turkey’s continuing pursuit of EU membership? We argue that the historical and <b>institutional</b> <b>trend</b> of modernization has locked Turkey into a pattern of domestic and foreign policies which is difficult, if not impossible, for current policymakers to break or reverse. As part of its modernization process, Turkey chose to follow a Western-oriented foreign policy, which became entrenched during the Cold War era with increasing returns or positive feedback from its overall engagement with the West and Europe in particular. Hence, the policy choices of Turkish policymakers about the EU are constrained by historical and institutional factors...|$|E

This control occurs both through {{ex ante regulation}} and ex post legal investigation. We delineate the respective scopes of those two kinds of monitoring when regulators and judges may not be benevolent. Separation between the ex ante and the ex post monitors of the firm helps to prevent capture. The likelihood of both ex ante and ex post inspections is higher under separation than under integration. This provides a rationale for the widespread <b>institutional</b> <b>trend</b> {{that has led to}} the separation of ex ante regulation from ex post prosecution. The robustness of this result is investigated in various extensions.

40|$|Contemporary European {{public law}} {{is marked by}} the uneasy {{relationship}} between national constitutional democracies and the executive-based supranational governance of the European Union. Whereas constitutional democracy remains the dominant source of inspiration for European institutional imagination, the supranational executive has relentlessly expanded its scope and institutional culture to key policy fields {{at the core of}} national constitutional democracies. This article tracks the rise of the supranational executive by examining three relational paradigms developed between national constitutional democracies and the European Union in distinct phases of the European integration process (i. e., the complementarity paradigm in the foundational period; the competition paradigm in the transformative period; and the encroachment paradigm during the economic and financial crisis). Following this account, this article claims that the supranational executive, owing to its predominance and ethos, corrodes and gradually displaces national constitutional democracies, bestowing an increasingly post-political character to European public law. This article concludes by discussing the possibilities to reverse the current <b>institutional</b> <b>trend</b> and to realign Europe 2 ̆ 7 s institutional reality and constitutional imaginati...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Price Discovery is {{the process}} by which new {{information}} is impounded into asset prices through trading activity. A market is considered to contribute more to price discovery if it is the first to capture new information regarding the fundamental value of an asset. Hasbrouck’s (1995) information share (IS) is the most widely used measure for price discovery contribution even though there is a well-documented concern with identification: its dependence on the ordering of the variable in the price vector and its non-uniqueness. In the first chapter, we propose a new measure, “Price Discovery Share” (PDS) that is closely related to IS and resolves the identification problems inherent in the IS method. PDS is motivated by a widely used method in risk management literature called the “risk-budgeting” or additive decomposition of portfolio volatility. Using simulated data based on different structural asset pricing models, we find that PDS measures the structural price discovery contribution more accurately than IS. In the second chapter, we apply Price Discovery Share (PDS) to investigate the “duplication of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) ” phenomenon, a recent <b>institutional</b> <b>trend</b> in financial markets. We show that although there are multiple ETFs tracking the S&P 500 index, one specific S&P 500 ETF (‘SPY’) always contributes more to price discovery than the rest. We also find that PDS, unlike Information Share (IS), is robust to the use of intra-day market price data sampled at different frequencies. In the third chapter, we study the effect of bond Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and bond mutual funds on the liquidity of U. S. corporate bonds. Depending on the liquidity measure used, we find different statistically significant results. ETF ownership has a positive impact on their underlying corporate bonds liquidity when we only consider bonds that are already bought and held by ETFs. Bond mutual funds ownership is found to play a positive impact on the liquidity of high yield corporate bonds...|$|E
40|$|O presente trabalho investiga a atuação de psicólogos escolares nos Colégios de Aplicação (CA) das Universidades Federais brasileiras. O objetivo da pesquisa é {{investigar}} práticas desenvolvidas pelos psicólogos nos CA das universidades federais, buscando identificar expressões teórico-práticas da perspectiva crítica em Psicologia Escolar e Educacional. O referencial teórico-metodológico utilizado é a Psicologia Escolar e Educacional em uma perspectiva histórico-crítica que se fundamenta no Materialismo Histórico Dialético. Para consecução desse estudo, optou-se pela abordagem qualitativa, cujos instrumentos foram entrevistas semiestruturadas com seis psicólogos e cinco diretores dos CA e Grupo Focal. O mapeamento inicial encontrou dezessete CA federais, dos quais nove contam com psicólogo escolar em seu quadro funcional, totalizando treze profissionais. A partir da análise das entrevistas com psicólogos e diretores dos CA, bem como do Grupo Focal, elencamos temas e elegemos três Eixos de Análise. No primeiro Eixo, Caracterização dos psicólogos da etapa de entrevistas individuais, encontramos 100 % de mulheres, com faixa etária entre 20 e 40 anos (71, 4 %), sendo 2 mestres, 1 doutora, as demais cursando Mestrado (2) e Doutorado (1), nas áreas de Psicologia e Educação. O segundo Eixo se refere à Atuação do psicólogo escolar nos CA, em que predomina a tendência institucional de atuação, abarcando vários segmentos alunos, professores, família, gestão, equipe pedagógica, funcionários, comunidade e está voltada para Educação Infantil, Ensino Fundamental e Médio e EJA. Notamos a presença de atividades tidas como tradicionais: avaliação psicoeducacional, orientação a alunos, professores e família, como também atividades consideradas emergentes: participação na elaboração do PPP, em Conselho Colegiado, em reuniões de planejamento pedagógico, apoio à gestão escolar, supervisão de estágio, realização de projetos de Ensino, Extensão e em menor proporção os de Pesquisa. Em relação aos principais desafios à atuação do psicólogo nos CA encontramos: romper com o modelo clínico de atuação, ampliar a leitura da queixa escolar, legitimar o lugar do psicólogo, definir prioridades para a atuação diante do excesso de demandas, realizar grupo de estudo, lidar com professores qualificados, encontrar elementos promotores de mudança na cultura escolar cristalizada, estreitar comunicação entre psicólogos dos CA. Das práticas desenvolvidas pelos psicólogos nos CA, localizamos o Estágio como {{a principal}} atividade promotora de Articulação entre Educação Básica e Ensino Superior (Eixo 3) e favorecedora do movimento de (re) formulação teórico-prática do conhecimento. Foram encontradas expressões teórico-práticas da perspectiva crítica em Psicologia Escolar e Educacional, apontando para avanços na área e para a continuidade de investimento na formação dos psicólogos. Concluímos que os CA são instituições potencialmente favoráveis a uma atuação predominantemente crítica em Psicologia Escolar, sobretudo pelas condições concretas de trabalho, por serem escolas básicas integrantes do sistema universitário público, as quais devem lutar pelo compromisso de garantir educação de qualidade. Formulamos a tese de que o psicólogo escolar, ao fundamentar sua atuação numa perspectiva histórico-crítica de Psicologia Escolar e Educacional, pode contribuir com a melhoria das condições de ensino nos Colégios de Aplicação, abarcando o coletivo da escola, ainda que sua atuação se configure em função das especificidades dessas instituições, das características da carreira e das singularidades do profissionalThis study investigates {{the performance of}} school psychologists in Application Schools (AS) of the Brazilian Federal Universities. The {{aim of the research}} is to investigate practices developed by psychologists in the federal universities AS in order to identify theoreticalpractical expressions from the critical perspective in School and Educational Psychology. The theoretical and methodological referential used is the School and Educational Psychology in a historical and critical perspective that is based on Dialectical Materialism History. To achieve this study, we chose the qualitative approach, whose instruments were semistructured interviews with six psychologists and five headmaster of the AS and Focal Group. The initial mapping found seventeen federal AS, from which, nine of them count on school psychologist on their staff, totaling thirteen professionals. From the analysis of the interviews with AS psychologists and headmaster, as well as the Focus Group, both we listed issues and elected three Analytical Axes. In the first axis, Psychologists characterization from the individual interviews phase, we found 100 % women, aged from 20 to 40 years old (71. 4 %), being 2 masters, 1 doctor, the others studying Master (2) and PhD (1), in the Psychology and Education areas. The second axis refers to the Psychologist performance, in which dominates the <b>institutional</b> <b>trend</b> of practice, covering various segments - students, teachers, family, management, teaching staff, employees, community and it is also focused on Childhood and Basic Education, High School and Youth/Adult Education. It is noticed the presence of activities which are considered as traditional : psychoeducational assessment and students, teachers and family guidance, but also activities considered emerging: participation in the PPP development in the Collegiate Council, participation in educational planning meetings, support to school management, probation supervision, conducting Education, Extension and, to a lesser extent, Research projects. On the main challenges to AS psychologist performance, we found: to break with the clinical model of practice, to expand the school complaint reading, to legitimize the psychologist place, to define priorities for action in the face of excessive demands, to conduct study group, to deal with qualified teachers, to find changers elements in crystallized school culture, to narrow communication among AS psychologists. From the practices developed by AS psychologists, we identified the Probation as the main promoter activity of Articulation between Basic Education and Higher Education (Axis 3) and, at the same time, the favoring of the movement on the theoretical-practical knowledge (re) formulation. Theoretical- practical expressions from the critical perspective in School and Educational Psychology were found, which point to advances in the area and for investment continuity in the psychologists formation. We conclude that the AS are potentially favorable institutions to a predominantly critical role in school psychology, especially by the concrete conditions of work as they are basic educational schools members of the public university system, which must fight for the commitment of ensuring quality education. We formulated the thesis that the school psychologist, when basing his performance in a historical- critical perspective of School and Educational Psychology, can contribute to improving teaching conditions in Application Schools, covering the school collective, even though his performance is characterized by the specificities of those institutions, by the career characteristics and by the professional peculiaritie...|$|E

In 2001, about 85 percent of the country’s population lived in rural areas, and over 80 percent of the laborforce worked in the agricultural sector. About two-thirds of these workers were (often resource-poor) small-scale farmers. In 2001 agriculture accounted for over one-third of gross domestic product (GDP); in 2002 it accounted for 83 percent of the country’s export earnings—mainly through tobacco, at 62 percent, and tea and sugar, at 10 and 7 percent, respectively (Mataya et al. 1998; World Bank 2003; FAO 2004).

On the other hand, {{new insights into the}} process of entering ECEC can be gained. This had not been possible for Starting Cohort 2 —Kindergarten as target children were sampled within the ECEC. But it has to be kept in mind that this data will not be available before 2018. As NEPS will be funded on a permanent basis and will be allowed to raise additional funding from the year 2014 on, supplemental observational studies on the process quality of ECEC classes may be conducted with this cohort. As mentioned before, until now data on the ECEC system had been based on self-reported information by the heads of ECEC institutions and ECEC class teachers. Whereas self-reports are clearly the method of choice for educational orientations, structural and especially process features might thus be distorted. Therefore, results reported in this paper mainly relate to factual information.|$|R

This has been recognized within Lebanon, which is undertaking developing a new civil aviation strategy encompassing a program of organizational reform, coordinated internationally, to meet the challenges of the new century. Such strategy is vital, as it will provide a coherent vision for the sector, compliment the extensive investments deployed by Lebanon in its aviation infrastructure, and guide future planning and investments. The proposed Civil Aviation Strategy for Lebanon has two major components: (a) institutional reform aiming at creating effective overall legal and regulatory frameworks in-line with current international best practice and (b) implementation of liberalization measures and open skies policy. This paper aims to: (a) present Lebanon’s current institutional arrangements, (b) review the institutional arrangements in key select countries (in order to define current <b>trends</b> in best <b>institutional</b> practice), (c) discuss the proposed institutional reforms (which are at the basis of Lebanon’s Draft Civil Aviation Reform Law) while showing that they conform with the identified best <b>institutional</b> <b>trends,</b> and (d) outline an implementation plan. The Draft Law has been approved by the Council of Ministers and now awaits Parliamentary endorsement...|$|R
