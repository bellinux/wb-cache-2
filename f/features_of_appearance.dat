40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} how {{to model the}} appearance of an object using multiple views � learn such a model from training images � and recognize objects with it. The model uses probability distributions to character� ize the signi�cance � position � and intrinsic measurements of various dis� crete <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> � it also describes topological relations among features. The features and their distributions are learned from training images depicting the modeled object. A matching procedure � combining qualities of both alignment and graph subisomorphism methods � uses fea� ture uncertainty information recorded by the model to guide {{the search for a}} match between model and image. Experiments show the method capable of learning to recognize complex objects in cluttered images� acquiring models that represent those objects using relatively few views. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{predominant}} {{purpose of}} vision is to facilitate {{interaction with the}} world. Motivated by biological vision, we argue that many common vision-guided activities {{can be carried out}} directly on the basis of <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance,</b> and do not require elaborate world models. We describe a visual feature learning system that supports a haptically guided, dextrous robotic grasping system. It learns features, combinations of Gaussian-derivative filter responses, that correlate well with successful grasping parameters. Without explicit knowledge of object identities or categories, the system learns to propose object-specific grasp parameters, considerably improving the quality of haptically guided grasps with respect to the "blind" system. The combined system is loosely anthropomorphic in that it is guided by vision for hand pre-shaping, and by haptics during execution of a grasp, without explicit object recognition, scene reconstruction, or path planning...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the semantics of bird denominations in Mari: an attempt is made to define the factors, or features, motivating bird denominations.

The results show that the ornithonomy of the Mari language, created over centuries, constitutes a well-shaped system. It reflects a variety of features associated with the appearance, way of life of the birds, sounds they produce, etc. Many bird terms reflect <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance.</b> It is interesting to note that the names of birds not seen for some reason may relate to the characteristics of the birds’ voices.

40|$|At {{present time}} {{prematurity}} {{is the main}} reason for disability in children, which can be exemplified by the fact that 2 / 3 of educatees of children' homes for blind and deaf are preterm children. The most drastic consequences of prematurity is cerebral palsy with spastic diplegia; blindness or poor vision as a result of retina detachment; auditory inefficiency connected with the nerve deafness, decline in general cognitive and speech development; difficulties in coordination and planning serial operations; psycho-emotional impairments like autism. The distinctive <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> (failure to thrive, microcephalism with deformation of the shape of the head) and behavior (stereotyped movements, lack in initiative purposeful activity) make these children recognizable and let us talk about naturally determined set of impairments connected with the main reason — prematurity.

40|$|We {{describe}} how {{to model the}} appearance of a 3 -D object using multiple views, learn such a model from training images, and use the model for object recognition. The model uses probability distributions to describe the range of possible variation in the object's appearance. These distributions are organized on two levels. Large variations are handled by partitioning training images into clusters corresponding to distinctly different views of the object. Within each cluster, smaller variations are represented by distributions characterizing uncertainty in the presence, position, and measurements of various discrete <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance.</b> Many types of features are used, ranging in abstraction from edge segments to perceptual groupings and regions. A matching procedure uses the feature uncertainty information to guide the search for a match between model and image.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to Provide the {{information}} regarding Diabetic retinopathy, its imaging methods and data base in systematic manner. In this paper we introduce the terms related to Diabetic Retinopathy along with the characteristic and <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> in the images. In this paper we also discuss the various image acquisition techniques of retina from fundus photography to 3 D OCT Imaaging. lastly we also provide the list of the current data base available with the ground truth. In Diabetic retinopathy the blood vessel becomes weak and due to this vessel leaks blood and fluid of lipoproteins,this creates abnormalaties in retina. Abnormal retinal images form four different classes namely nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), Choroidal neovascularisation membrane (CNVM) and central serous retinopathy (CSR). There may exist different kinds of abnormal lesions caused by diabetic retinopathy in a diabetic’s eye. The lesion types ar...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} how {{emotions}} ground perception and social interaction. We propose a virtual society in which each agent has its subjective perception of the others, and in which this perception is aimed at focusing a large potential of interaction into the most productive direction. Rather than to focus attention based on a cognitive evaluation of compatibility between different agent's interests, we argue for using <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance,</b> presentation and material exchange as elements in a "social filter " that directs attention in an emotional as opposed to a cognitive (knowledge-based) way. We show how such external clues are tight into a hormonal model of emotions for behavior control. At the social level we develop ideas on how emotions play a role in agent interactions (emotional rhetoric) and long-term agent coordination (representation). Introduction The problem we address is the following: how do agents that are embedded in large societies [...] -hundreds t [...] ...|$|E

40|$|To {{recognize}} {{an object}} in an image one must have an internal model of how that object may appear. This proposal describes a method for learning such models from training images. The proposed method models an object by a probability distribution that describes the range of possible variation in the object's appearance. This probability distribution is organized on two levels. Large variations are handled by partitioning the training images into clusters that may correspond to distinctly different views of the object. Within each cluster, smaller variations are represented by probability distributions that characterize the presence, position, and measurements of various discrete <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance.</b> The learning process combines an incremental conceptual clustering algorithm for forming the clusters with a generalization algorithm for consolidating each cluster's training images into a single description. Recognition, which involves matching the features of a training image with those of a cluster's description, can employ information about feature positions, numeric measurements, and relations in order to constrain and speed the search. Preliminary experiments have been conducted with a system that implements {{some aspects of the}} proposed method; the system can learn to recognize a single characteristic view of {{an object in}} the presence of occlusion and clutter...|$|E

40|$|Fairy tales are an {{integral}} part of popular culture, as most people grow up listening to and reading these stories, while also watching adaptions of them in movies and TV series. This thesis seeks to analyze two versions of “Snow White” that are typically regarded as the traditional versions of the fairy tale, as these are well established in the landscape of popular fairy tales, that is “Snow White” (1857) by the brothers Grimm and the movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) by Walt Disney. These traditional tales will be juxtaposed with three postmodern fairy tales that are either variations of the traditional tale, or use “Snow White” as an intertext in order to scrutinize how these narratives disclose the ideology of the traditional tales, that is “The Snow Child” (1979) by Angela Carter, “Snow, Glass, Apples” (1999) by Neil Gaiman and Toni Morrison’s novel God Help the Child (2015). 	This thesis will argue that fairy tales are capable of conveying central truths about culture, ideology and the structures in which we establish ourselves as individual subjects. This thesis aims to investigate the traces of patriarchal ideology that can be found in literature, and the roles that narratives play in challenging or affirming dominant ideology. The texts that have been selected for the analysis extend from 1857 to 2015, and it will be argued that the same ideological structures can be found in all these text, while also proposing that literature might function to displace this ideology. 	This thesis is written to explore the relationships made possible between women within a patriarchal structure, and it will put a particularly focus on how images of female beauty restrict the roles available for women, and how these ideals of femininity inevitably turn women against each other. Throughout this thesis I will investigate how images of beauty and ideals of femininity concern both internal and external beauty, and how the concept of beauty then might work to instill social values in the readers, as the ideal of beauty in “Snow White” does not merely prescribe <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance,</b> but also images of accepted female conduct...|$|E
