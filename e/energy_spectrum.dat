40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{extensive}} air shower (EAS) data obtained by the GAMMA experiment, the <b>energy</b> <b>spectra</b> and elemental composition of the primary cosmic rays are derived in the 1 - 100 PeV energy range. The reconstruction of the primary <b>energy</b> <b>spectra</b> is carried out using an EAS inverse approach in the framework of the SIBYLL 2. 1 and QGSJET 01 interaction models and the hypothesis of power-law primary <b>energy</b> <b>spectra</b> with rigidity-dependent knees. The <b>energy</b> <b>spectra</b> of primary H, He, O-like and Fe-like nuclei obtained with the SIBYLL interaction model agree with corresponding extrapolations of the balloon and satellite data to ~ 1 PeV <b>energies.</b> The <b>energy</b> <b>spectra</b> obtained from the QGSJET model show a predominantly proton composition in the knee region. The rigidity-dependent knee feature of the primary <b>energy</b> <b>spectra</b> for each interaction model is displayed at the following rigidities: ~ 2. 5 +/- 0. 2 PV (SIBYLL) and ~ 3. 1 - 4. 2 PV (QGSJET).

25|$|For example, {{by adding}} a perturbative {{electric}} potential to the quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom, tiny shifts in the spectral lines of hydrogen caused {{by the presence of}} an electric field (the Stark effect) can be calculated. This is only approximate because the sum of a Coulomb potential with a linear potential is unstable (has no true bound states) although the tunneling time (decay rate) is very long. This instability shows up as a broadening of the <b>energy</b> <b>spectrum</b> lines, which perturbation theory fails to reproduce entirely.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} {{is different in}} a superconductor. In a conventional superconductor, the electronic fluid cannot be resolved into individual electrons. Instead, it consists of bound pairs of electrons known as Cooper pairs. This pairing is caused by an attractive force between electrons from the exchange of phonons. Due to quantum mechanics, the <b>energy</b> <b>spectrum</b> of this Cooper pair fluid possesses an energy gap, meaning there is a minimum amount of energy ΔE that must be supplied in order to excite the fluid. Therefore, if ΔE {{is larger than the}} thermal energy of the lattice, given by kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature, the fluid will not be scattered by the lattice. The Cooper pair fluid is thus a superfluid, meaning it can flow without energy dissipation.|$|E

The effects of the pulse duration and timing of the X-ray pulse on the photoelectron <b>energy</b> <b>spectra</b> are discussed. Analysis of the spectra obtained for very long pulses show that certain features may be explained in terms of quantum interferences in the time domain. It is found that, depending on the duration of the X-ray pulse, ripples in the <b>energy</b> <b>spectra</b> separated by the infrared photon energy may appear. Moreover, the temporal shape of the low frequency radiation field may be inferred by the breadth of the photoelectron <b>energy</b> <b>spectra.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

25|$|PWRs are {{designed}} to be maintained in an undermoderated state, meaning that there is room for increased water volume or density to further increase moderation, because if moderation were near saturation, then a reduction in density of the moderator/coolant could reduce neutron absorption significantly while reducing moderation only slightly, making the void coefficient positive. Also, light water is actually a somewhat stronger moderator of neutrons than heavy water, though heavy water's neutron absorption is much lower. Because of these two facts, light water reactors have a relatively small moderator volume and therefore have compact cores. One next generation design, the supercritical water reactor, is even less moderated. A less moderated neutron <b>energy</b> <b>spectrum</b> does worsen the capture/fission ratio for 235U and especially 239Pu, meaning that more fissile nuclei fail to fission on neutron absorption and instead capture the neutron to become a heavier nonfissile isotope, wasting one or more neutrons and increasing accumulation of heavy transuranic actinides, some of which have long half-lives.|$|E
25|$|The <b>energy</b> <b>spectrum</b> of an {{electron}} {{moving in a}} periodical potential of rigid crystal lattice consists of allowed and forbidden bands and {{is known as the}} Bloch spectrum. An electron with energy inside an allowed band moves as a free electron but has an effective mass that differs from the electron mass in vacuum. However, a crystal lattice is deformable and displacements of atoms (ions) from their equilibrium positions are described in terms of phonons. Electrons interact with these displacements, and this interaction is known as electron-phonon coupling. One of possible scenarios was proposed in the seminal 1933 paper by Lev Landau, which includes the production of a lattice defect such as an F-center and a trapping of the electron by this defect. A different scenario was proposed by Solomon Pekar that envisions dressing the electron with lattice deformation (a cloud of virtual phonons). Such {{an electron}} with the accompanying deformation moves freely across the crystal, but with increased effective mass. Pekar coined for this charge carrier the term polaron.|$|E
25|$|In energy {{dispersive}} analysis, dispersion and detection are a single operation, {{as already mentioned}} above. Proportional counters or various types of solid-state detectors (PIN diode, Si(Li), Ge(Li), Silicon Drift Detector SDD) are used. They all share the same detection principle: An incoming X-ray photon ionises {{a large number of}} detector atoms with the amount of charge produced being proportional to the energy of the incoming photon. The charge is then collected and the process repeats itself for the next photon. Detector speed is obviously critical, as all charge carriers measured have to come from the same photon to measure the photon energy correctly (peak length discrimination is used to eliminate events that seem to have been produced by two X-ray photons arriving almost simultaneously). The spectrum is then built up by dividing the <b>energy</b> <b>spectrum</b> into discrete bins and counting the number of pulses registered within each energy bin. EDXRF detector types vary in resolution, speed and the means of cooling (a low number of free charge carriers is critical in the solid state detectors): proportional counters with resolutions of several hundred eV cover {{the low end of the}} performance spectrum, followed by PIN diode detectors, while the Si(Li), Ge(Li) and Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) occupy the high end of the performance scale.|$|E

25|$|Measurements of {{the energy}} and arrival {{directions}} of the ultra-high energy primary cosmic rays by the techniques of density sampling and fast timing of extensive air showers were first carried out in 1954 {{by members of the}} Rossi Cosmic Ray Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The experiment employed eleven scintillation detectors arranged within a circle 460 meters in diameter {{on the grounds of the}} Agassiz Station of the Harvard College Observatory. From that work, and from many other experiments carried out all over the world, the <b>energy</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the primary cosmic rays is now known to extend beyond 1020eV. A huge air shower experiment called the Auger Project is currently operated at a site on the pampas of Argentina by an international consortium of physicists, led by James Cronin, winner of the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics from the University of Chicago, and Alan Watson of the University of Leeds. Their aim is to explore the properties and arrival directions of the very highest-energy primary cosmic rays. The results are expected to have important implications for particle physics and cosmology, due to a theoretical Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit to the energies of cosmic rays from long distances (about 160 million light years) which occurs above 1020eV because of interactions with the remnant photons from the Big Bang origin of the universe.|$|E
