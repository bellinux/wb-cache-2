This system reduced the cell installation costs and made the cell more compact. During this period, the orifice diameter was increased from the 28 mm design used in 1990 to 34 mm with the Mark II model and 38 mm in 1997. This, together with the larger Mark II downcomer diameter, allowed the slurry flow per downcomer to be doubled from 30 m3/h in 1990 to 60 m3/h in 1997.|$|E
40|$|In {{resource}} recovery from end-of-life {{printed circuit board}} (PCB), the physical processing route is considered most environmentally friendly. The − 75 µm fraction generated during the comminution assays well above many precious and base metal deposits, but contributes overall drop in value recovery. This investigation was aimed at exploiting the versatility of froth flotation for beneficiation of the PCB comminution fines. Chemical composition characterisation work shows wet assay of constituents in the sample vary with digestion condition. Absolute assays as for hazardous constituents thus require comparison of data {{from more than one}} digestion condition. Comparative assaying of samples from beneficiation treatments can use aqua regia digestion which gives a less hazardous procedure compared to hydrogen fluoride combined with microwave and nitric acid treatments. It also gives leach liquor from which all constituent elements can be analysed, compared to that from total digestion via sodium peroxide fusion. For this sample total digestion will therefore not always give better results compared to partial digestion. Findings also show that thermogravimetric analysis may not be recommended in PCB characterisation. It gave no distinct inflexion point to characterize any constituent. This is due to the very diverse material constituents of the sample. Further on characterisation, the sample gave a loose bulk density lighter than water, and true sample density of 3 g/cm 3. This coupled with surface hydrophobicity observed necessitates that pulping the sample must be done under water. Light optical and scanning electron microscopy showed particle liberation was very high, but not total. Morphology of the metallic particles was very diverse, with average circularity shape factor of 0. 63. This coupled with the material diversity is a major constraint in sub-sieve size analysis of the sample. As shown by scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, the liberated particles themselves contain more than one chemical element, being alloys. Beneficiation operation therefore cannot attempt to separate such particles into constituent elements but some bulk collection of metallic values into a concentrate. Reverse flotation of metallic values based on a scheme described as natural hydrophobic response (NHR) was found successful. Favorable kinetics under the scheme gave about 500 rpm and 500 ml/min aeration rate, at 300 g sample in a 3. 5 l Leeds cell. Without the use of a collector, natural hydrophobic response was observed. The system also gave a stable froth without the aid of a frother. Investigations (surface tension and dynamic froth stability height measurements, combined with general literature) show the NHR froth is a fine particle stabilised froth, and not surfactant stabilised. Au and Pd, were among the elements best enriched into the sink; 64 % recovery for Au at enrichment ratio of three. Flotation over narrower and coarser fraction (+ 106 – 75 µm) shows the NHR scheme can be successfully applied at this size. Chemical conditioning schemes investigated shows very minimal responses to reagents. Potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) did not condition the metallic particles for flotation remarkably as it does with native metals. Sulfidation with sodium hydrogen sulfide shows a little improvement in response to PAX. Sodium mercaptobenzothiazole – a very selective collector for tarnished copper and lead minerals – did not show such selectivity in the PCB comminution fines pulp. Some cationic pull with tetrabutyl ammonium chloride towards selective pull of non-metallic values after NHR pull has subsided was observed, although very little also. Macromolecular depression with carboxyl methyl cellulose did not subdue the natural hydrophobic response up to profuse percentage dosages. Depression by lowering surface tension, described as gamma depression, using Betamin 127 A (active constituent: ethoxy nonyl phenol) was effective to wet hydrophobic particles, but still not helpful for selective pull after chemical conditioning. At the lowered surface tension, frothing sets in coupled with entrainment. Probable causatives for the poor response to reagents are surface oxidation of the metallic particles and depression by calcium ions in pulp. Surface studies with field emission scanning electron microscope and auger electron spectroscopy composition depth profiling, show presence of organic layers {{on the surface of the}} metallic particles. The surfaces were also found to be oxidised down to about 340 nm depth profiled. None of the surfaces is a pure alloy, but occurring in forms that will be relatively inert to reagents. Beside these, from aqua regia wet assaying, the sample contains about 7 % calcium by mass, and ICP-MS trace element analysis of the process water confirms calcium presence up to 7 ppm equilibrium concentration in the pulp. Judging from the responses, the natural hydrophobic response scheme can be well recommended for PCB comminution <b>fines</b> <b>flotation.</b> Optimisation of the performance of the scheme responds remarkably well to kinetic parameters variation. With the generally low impeller energy and aeration rate found favourable for PCB CF flotation, and the zero reagent cost (no collector, no frother) of the NHR scheme, PCB comminution <b>fines</b> <b>flotation</b> shows good prospects.

In the current study, the effect of iron contamination on the flotation of galena and chalcopyrite on a particle size basis was investigated. It was observed that fine galena and chalcopyrite (− 10 μm) were affected by iron oxidation species emanating from grinding media to a much greater extent than intermediate size fractions (+ 10 – 53 μm), and that grinding conditions had a more pronounced effect on <b>fine</b> galena <b>flotation</b> than <b>fine</b> chalcopyrite <b>flotation.</b> Mechanisms were investigated by rest potential measurement, ToF-SIMS analysis, mineral dissolution study and zeta potential measurement. It appears that fine particles (− 10 μm) are more easily oxidised than intermediate particles resulting in a higher concentration of metal oxidation species. Oxidation of galena and chalcopyrite enhances adsorption of iron oxidation species at pH 9 by electrostatic interaction. Fine oxidised galena has a stronger affinity for iron oxidation species than fine oxidised chalcopyrite. ...|$|R

The effect of coal particle size, water quality and chemical reagents which can be manipulated in flotation plants, on the froth stability and coal flotation performance was investigated. It was found that froth stability was dependent on the coal particle size, the proportion of process water mixed with de-ionised water and the dosage of the collector or frother. Mixing coarse coal particles with fine coal, diluting process water, and reducing collector or frother dosage all significantly decreased the froth stability.

However, they can only adsorb on molybdenite faces and not on molybdenite edges, resulting in limited molybdenite recovery, especially in processed water containing a high amounts of Ca 2 +. In this study, the influence of Ca 2 + and pH on the adsorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as part of composite collection on molybdenite edges, was studied. It was found that PAHs could only adsorb on molybdenite edges {{in the presence of}} Ca 2 +. Ca 2 + reacted with molybdenite edges to form CaMoO 4 precipitates. Then, CaMoO 4 precipitates interacted with PAHs to form a structure of π–cation–π by (1) the cation–π interaction, (2) the π–π interaction and (3) the electrostatic interaction.

40|$|Anglo American Kumba Iron Ore, {{a member}} of the Anglo American plc group, owns {{high-quality}} resource bases in both South Africa and Brazil. One of these, Sishen iron ore mine, is a South African mine, where lumpy high-grade hematite ore is treated. As these easily treatable resources depletes, alternative processing methods need to be investigated to ensure sustainability. Low-grade iron ores are commonly beneficiated by a combination of magnetic separation, gravity separation and direct- or reverse <b>flotation.</b> <b>Fine</b> size iron ore fractions, less than 150 micron, requires flotation to be beneficiated to high-grade saleable iron ore product for pelletizing. Three flotation routes have been developed for iron ores outside of Africa: (i) reverse cationic flotation of quartz; (ii) direct anionic flotation of iron oxides; and (iii) reverse anionic flotation of activated quartz. Although vast ores of increasingly complex nature have been identified in Africa, existing literature does not mention any iron ore flotation practices that are currently employed or investigated on this continent. The aim {{of this study was to}} prove that low grade Sishen banded iron ore can be upgraded to a saleable iron product by froth flotation. This was proven by a mineralogical study of banded low grade Sishen iron ore; the evaluation of suitable reagent suites; flotation cell conditions; additional beneficiation circuit stages; evaluation of the developed flotation regime on varied feed compositions and determination of correlations between the mineral liberation analysis and flotation results. The fundamental mechanism for selective flotation of hematite is attributed to the selective depression of hematite, where quartz particles may be removed from hematite in a narrow pH range. In this pH range, amine collectors form an ion-molecular complex, which induces hydrophobicity on the surface of quartz particles and attain its frothing character. Reverse cationic flotation is the most-common approach for hematite-quartz separation. Amines are used as collecting reagent; two amine variants supplied by Clariant, have been identified to exhibiting superior silica collecting performance. Starch is the most commonly employed hematite depressant. The ore characterisation of seven clearly identified low grade banded iron formation, BIF, iron ore samples from Sishen iron ore mine, and an equal blend of these seven BIF samples comprises of Chemical composition (by x-ray fluorescence, XRF), mineralogical composition (x-ray diffraction, XRD and mineral liberation analysis, MLA), particle size distribution (sieve tests and laser diffraction) and mineral liberation (by scanning electron microscopy, SEM and MLA). Baseline flotation parameters for reverse flotation of low grade Sishen iron ore BIF, which included bench-scale laboratory flotation tests were established by the evaluation of the depressant type, depressant dosage and depressant dosing stage, dispersant type and dispersant dosage, collector dosage and mixed collector ratio, grinding size and flotation circuit configuration. Results from this investigation identify hematite as the main iron bearing mineral in low grade Sishen iron ore and quartz as the main gangue mineral, with limited amounts of annite and kaolinite. The iron content ranges between 25 % and 39 % for the received individual samples. The particle size distribution, with 80 % passing 1. 1 mm, was too coarse for flotation. Grinding curves were constructed to produce a <b>fine</b> <b>flotation,</b> medium flotation and coarse flotation particle size range. Laboratory bench scale flotation tests confirm strong pH dependence for the recovery of hematite, where a natural hydrophobicity is exhibited at pH 7. These tests confirmed that caustisized starch is a suitable depressant for hematite minerals in a low grade Sishen BIF iron ore and that the addition of sodium silicate dispersant may improve the iron product grade. The depressant dosage has a minor effect on the flotation results, and the depressant mechanism is largely dependent on the flotation pulp pH. Froth stability is greatly influenced by a change in the amine collector dosage, where excessive amounts of fine particles also over stabilise the froth bed and it is not possible to control the froth bed height at collector dosages of larger than 25 g/t/stage. Alteration of the flotation circuit, from a six stage rougher float to a nine stage rougher float and six stage scavenger float, after additional milling and depressant dosing, yielded the required target of at least 64 % Fe and 30 % recovery to the tails(iron product). With no preparation by de-sliming, an iron recovery of 34. 7 % to the iron product can be achieved by flotation alone. At 66. 4 % iron, MLA analysis confirmed the iron product to be of a saleable high grade. The MLA analysis also showed the limit of flotation performance to be an excessive entrainment of iron-containing particles after the second scavenger flotation stage. The use of this reagent suite on individual BIF ores shows that more than 98. 5 % of the silicate materials can be removed to the froth phase. As with the composite BIF material, an additional scavenger stage is required to reach the target percentage iron recovery of 30 %.

In the study, {{it was interesting}} to find that an anionic polymer dispersant, lignosulfonate, successfully mitigated the negative effect of clay minerals in coal flotation using fresh water, but in saline water, it exacerbated coal flotation. In order to understand the mechanisms underpinning the different behaviour of lignosulfonate in coal flotation using fresh and saline water, the adsorption isotherm, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were conducted in this study. While DLS monitored the molecular conformation change (swelling or shrinking) of the polymer in fresh and saline water, adsorption isotherms enabled polymer adsorbed amount on clay and coal mineral surfaces to be determined. It was found that lignosulfonate adsorbed on the coal and clay mineral surfaces providing effective electrostatic repulsions and resulting in a mitigation of clay minerals from coal surfaces in deionised water. In the presence of saline water, however, polymer molecular conformation changed. Polymer molecules were compressed and adsorbed in form of aggregates. The adsorption amount of lignosulfonate on clay minerals increased in saline water. A low dosage of lignosulfonate could not provide sufficient electrosteric repulsion to disperse clay minerals. Moreover, the high adsorption amount of the polymer on coal and clay surfaces led to a more hydrophilic coal surface, and coal flotation was therefore depressed in saline water.

The flotation tests were carried out at semi-continuous mode using a laboratory-scale flotation column. The results suggest that use of the fluidic oscillator can lead to substantial reagent cost savings and help improve coal flotation efficiency. Further experiments were carried out to fundamentally understand the effect of different air flow patterns on the flotation performance. Compared to steady air flow, oscillatory air flow results in better gas dispersion, higher gas holdup, higher foam stability, and less axial mixing of fluid inside the flotation column...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} thirty years, process control has spread from the {{chemical}} industry into the fields of mineral and coal processing. Today, process control computers, combined with improved instrumentation, are capable of effective control in many modem flotation circuits. Unfortunately, the classical methods used in most control strategies have severe limitations when used in froth flotation. For example, the nonlinear nature of the flotation process can cause single-input, single-output lines to battle each other in attempts to achieve a given objective. Other problems experienced in classical control schemes include noisy signals from sensors and the inability to measure certain process variables. For example, factors related to ore type or water chemistry, such as liberation, froth stability, and floatability, cannot be measured by conventional means. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an advanced control system for <b>fine</b> coal <b>flotation.</b> The demonstration is being carried out at an existing coal preparation plant by a team consisting of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI&SU) as the prime contractor and J. A. Herbst and Associates as a subcontractor. The objectives of this work are: (1) to identify through sampling, analysis, and simulation those variables which can be manipulated to maintain grades, recoveries, and throughput rates at levels set by management; (2) {{to develop and implement}} a model-based computer control strategy that continuously adjusts those variables to maximize revenue subject to various metallurgical, economic, and environmental constraints; and (3) to employ a video-based optical analyzer for on-line analysis of ash content in fine coal slurries...|$|R
40|$|A study {{conducted}} by Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center of sulfur emissions from about 1, 300 United States coal-fired utility boilers indicated {{that half of the}} emissions were the result of burning coals having greater than 1. 2 pounds of SO{sub 2 } per million BTU. This was mainly attributed to the high pyritic sulfur content of the boiler fuel. A significant reduction in SO{sub 2 } emissions could be accomplished by removing the pyrite from the coals by advanced physical fine coal cleaning. An engineering development project was prepared to build upon the basic research effort conducted under a solicitation for research into Fine Coal Surface Control. The engineering development project is intended to use general plant design knowledge and conceptualize a plant to utilize advanced froth flotation technology to process coal and produce a product having maximum practical pyritic sulfur reduction consistent with maximum practical BTU recovery. The overall project scope of the engineering development project is to conceptually develop a commercial flowsheet to maximize pyritic sulfur reduction at practical energy recovery values. This is being accomplished by utilizing the basic research data on the surface properties of coal, mineral matter and pyrite obtained from the Coal Surface Control for Advanced <b>Fine</b> Coal <b>Flotation</b> Project, to develop this conceptual flowsheet. This progress report provides a summary of the technical work undertaken during this period, highlighting the major results.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemistry)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2002 The aim of {{the study}} was to develop an {{understanding}} of <b>fine</b> coal <b>flotation</b> emphasizing developing methodology capable of selecting the optimum flotation reagent. A secondary aim was to use the experimental data in a statistical program to validate the findings and investigate correlations between flotation performance and coal characteristics. The predictions that were made from the coal characterisation results were confirmed. Oleic acid, iso-decanol and dodecene resulted in the best flotation performance on the coal samples that were evaluated. This is in agreement with previous research findings, that oleic acid is a good collector for coal and that branched hydrocarbons also increase flotation yields. The ability of unsaturated hydrocarbons to increase flotation yield was also confirmed. The study included 5 coal samples from different collieries - Twistdraai (Highveld seam 3 and 4), Waterberg (Zone 10 - 11), Syferfontein seam 5 upper (Highveld) and Witbank seam 2 and seam 4. Twistdraai, Waterberg and Syferfontein seam 5 upper were all found to be vitrinite rich coals. The Witbank coals are both more inertinite rich. The feed ash contents determined for the flotation feed samples were 28. 8 % for Twistdraai coal, 13. 9 % for Syferfontein seam 5 upper, 28. 8 % for Waterberg coal, 16. 1 % for Witbank seam 2 coal and 33. 8 % for Witbank seam 4 coal. The coal characterisation study included petrographic analysis, proximate analysis, float-sink analysis, oxygen-containing functional groups, surface extraction, flotation release analysis and contact angle measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{flotation}} of quartz particles was studied {{over the}} {{particle size range}} from 0. 5 f. !m to 1000 f. !m and for advancing water contact angles between oo and 83 o. Flotation was performed in a column and in a Rushton turbine cell. Particle contact angle threshold values, below which the particles could not be floated, were identified for the particle size range 0. 5 - 1000 f. !m, under different hydrodynamic conditions. The flotation response of the particles, either in a column or in a mechanically agitated cell with a similar bubble size, was comparable. Turbulence plays a role, as does bubble-particle aggregate velocity and bubble size. The stability of the bubble-particle aggregate controls the maximum floatable particle size of coarse particles. For <b>fine</b> particles, the <b>flotation</b> limit is dictated by the energy required to rupture the intervening liquid film between the particle and bubble. <b>Flotation</b> of very <b>fine</b> and large particles is facilitated with small bubbles and high contact angles. These results greatly extend our earlier observations and theoretical predictions. ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{effects of}} the {{collector}} added before grinding and after grinding on the subsequent flotation and mineral surface properties were investigated. The pH was controlled at 10 during the grinding and flotation processes opened to the atmosphere. With enough amounts of sodium butyl xanthate addition, adding the collector before grinding recovered more chalcopyrite than adding it after grinding in single mineral flotation. The Eh of each ground pulp before and after conditioning were measured and {{it was found that}} adding collector before grinding obtained higher and relatively suitable pulp potential for chalcopyrite flotation. Particle size analyses of the flotation products indicate that the different flotation recoveries occurred due to the different <b>flotation</b> losses in <b>fine</b> particles (< 20 Â Î¼m). XPS analyses focused on the <b>fine</b> particles of <b>flotation</b> feedings and found that more carbon and oxygen, and less iron were remained on mineral surfaces when the collector was added before grinding, due to the higher collector adsorption capacity, larger free oxygen adsorbance and less iron oxide/hydroxide species.

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines is {{optimizing}} {{the design}} of an air-sparged hydrocyclone. This report summarizes the initial stage of the project [...] the prediction of collision efficiencies {{for use in a}} comprehensive air-sparged hydrocyclone model. The equations of motion are presented in nondimensional form and solved numerically for a small spherical particle passing around a larger bubble in an infinite fluid under the influence of a strong force field. Collision efficiencies are determined from the calculated particle trajectories for values of stokes' number, k, between 0. 01 and 100 and for values of the nondimensional force, w, between 0. 0 and 100. These large values of k and w are needed to model high-performance flotation devices like the air-sparged hydrocyclone; solutions for the required k and w values have not appeared in the literature prior to this study. Effects of changes in particle-to-bubble radius ratio are considered for both viscous and potential flows.

40|$|Considerable {{amounts of}} fine {{particles}} (smaller than 150 micron) are produced during {{the processing of}} coal. Significant value can be realized if this fraction can be economically beneficiated, disregarding the negative environmental impact of <b>fine</b> coal. <b>Flotation</b> is a very common worldwide beneficiation process to recover ultra-fine coal material and has been implemented in many oversees operations. However, flotation in South Africa has not fully matured—difficult coal types, high operating cost, inexperience of plant personnel and cell design {{are only a few}} of the reasons for flotation not being widely implemented. Reagent cost is by far the largest single contributor to the operating cost. The challenge with reagent selection, however, is that reagents are very selective and very sensitive to a change in ore characteristics—a new reagent combination is required when there is a drastic change in the ore characteristics. Frother selection is crucial due to the fact that the coal has a froth carrying capacity constraint. However, frother test work is notoriously difficult on a laboratory scale. Therefore, the aim was to develop a fast, effective and reliable method of choosing flotation reagent combinations and to verify this combination on a pilot scale. Laboratory scale froth characterization techniques (froth height, froth breakdown rate, froth carrying capacity, froth water recovery, selectivity and solids concentration in froth) were conducted in a 3 litre Leeds cell and Bikerman flotation column, whereas the pilot-plant scale tests were conducted at Kangra coal in a Dual Cell from ENPROTEC. The results have indicated that the froth characterization tests can be very successfully implemented to select a reagent combination that realizes significant value during pilot campaign runs. The pilotplant results showed that by changing the reagent regime to the lab-predicted suite, a reagent cost saving of 43 %, an increase in yield of 5 %, with a decrease in product ash of 3 %, can be realized...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} the theoretical basis for experimental determination of bubble-particle attachment probability in single-bubble flotation experiments. We use these experimentally determined data to simulate the dependence of induction time on particle size, Using these simulated results, we verify the bubble-particle attachment probability prediction developed {{on the basis of}} sliding time and induction time (the Sutherland approach). We have calculated the induction times of fine quartz particles of different diameters less than 80 mu m and different hydrophobicity, collected by single bubbles with diameters of 0. 75 mm, 1. 2 mm and 2. 0 mm. The simulation reported in this present paper shows that the calculated induction times increase with decreasing particle size, except for particles of strong hydrophobicity (advancing water contact angle of 65 degrees and 88 degrees) collected by the small bubbles with a diameter of 0. 75 mm. These results for induction time indicate that extant attachment probability models, based on sliding time and induction rime, cannot adequately describe the elementary steps in the bubble-particle attachment microprocess in flotation, A detailed analysis of induction time, as originally defined and measured by Sven-Nilsson and others was performed. The necessity of the elementary step 2 ̆ 7 rupture of liquid film and formation of three-phase contact of a critical radius (TPC nuclei) 2 ̆ 7 in bubble-particle attachment has been demonstrated. It is suggested that attachment probability can be adequately described by the product of the probabilities of three elementary steps: (1) thinning of intervening liquid film to a critical film thickness; (2) rupture of intervening liquid film and formation of TPC nuclei; (3) expansion of three-phase contact line from the critical radius to form a stable wetting perimeter. The attachment probability model developed according to the Sutherland approach describes only the first elementary step. The poor response of <b>fine</b> particle <b>flotation</b> may be attributed to the decreasing probability of the second elementary step. A more detailed investigation of these elementary steps is required for understanding the attachment microprocess in flotation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The role of gas {{nucleation}} and cavitation in flotation {{has been}} systemically studied. It was shown theoretically {{that about a}} 10 m high recovery zone is required to ensure at least one collision between a particle less than 10 $ mu$m and a bubble, under conventional column flotation conditions, indicating that the collision is the rate limiting step for <b>fine</b> particle <b>flotation.</b> Direct formation of small bubbles on the hydrophobic particle surfaces and in slurry by gas nucleation and cavitation has, therefore, been exploited {{as a way to}} accelerate the fine particle collection rate. Experimentally, the existence of gas nuclei in water was demonstrated from coagulation, sedimentation and filtration tests of fine coal (d$ sb{ 50 } approx 5 mu$m) and silica (d$ sb{ 50 } approx 3. 5 mu$m) particles. Small bubbles are generated, from the expansion of the pre-existing gas nuclei, by hydrodynamic cavitation induced by flow of liquid through a nozzle at a velocity of 8 - 15 m/s, depending on nozzle diameter and length. This velocity of bubble initiation is reduced 5 - 7 m/s when the liquid is gas-supersaturated. Surfactants do not affect the on-set of bubble formation by cavitation, but increase the amount of bubbles formed. The addition of a small amount of hydrophobic particles in gas-supersaturated systems increases the quantity of bubbles generated, while the presence of hydrophilic particles reduces bubble formation. Dissolved air (or carbon dioxide) <b>flotation</b> of <b>fine</b> silica (d$ sb{ 50 } approx 1. 6 mu$m) has shown that recovery increases with the slurry flow velocity, regardless of the saturation pressures applied (102 - 310 kPA). Releasing the gas-supersaturated slurry into a solution gives a higher recovery than releasing the gas-supersaturated slurry into a slurry. These observations suggest that bubble nucleation is a better mechanism for enhancing particle collection compared with the direct particle-bubble contact. Flotation results using a newly designed flotation reactor indicate that adding a cavitation tube and a small amount of air in the feed stream increases recovery significantly, and that bubbles formed by hydrodynamic cavitation play a role in improving flotation kinetics, {{even in the absence of}} added gas in the stream...|$|R
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 200 - 212). This thesis {{presents an}} evaluation of an Oscillatory Baffled Column as a novel flotation device and as a research tool for investigating the role which hydrodynamics play in promoting particle-bubble contacting. The cell differs from a conventional cell design in that bubble generation is decoupled from the power input. This allows the hydrodynamic environment to be optimised for effective particlebubble contacting. The design also incorporates a novel mechanism of agitation which provides a more even distribution of shear rate than would be obtained in a stirred system and allows considerably more variation of the power input to the cell. Based on these properties it is hypothesised that the OBC would provide an effective hydrodynamic environment for <b>fine</b> particle <b>flotation,</b> particularly in highly viscous, non-Newtonian slurries. It is also hypothesised {{that the development of}} such a cell technology will facilitate an improved understanding of the role which hydrodynamics play in promoting particle-bubble contacting. To investigate these hypotheses, the OBC was first characterised in terms of key flotation parameters, such as bubble size, gas hold-up and mixing. The cell was then flotation tested on quartz, in order to benchmark the study against previous studies on hydrodynamics and particle-bubble contacting in stirred systems. Finally, the OBC was tested in application to a highly viscous, non-Newtonian nickel ore slimes slurry which is difficult to treat using conventional cell technologies. This study gave context to the potential future role of OBC technology in the minerals processing industry. The results of this thesis clearly show that the OBC is a promising novel technology for the treatment of fine mineral slurries. The cell has been demonstrated to significantly improve flotation kinetics by a factor of between 1. 4 and 1. 6 relative to a standard column. Optimal flotation conditions were obtained at power dissipations as low as 10 W/m 3. The advantages of the OBC as a novel device include its ability to decouple bubble generation and particle-bubble contacting, its even distribution of shear rate in the cell as well as the additional fluctuating fluid motion produced under oscillatory flow. Furthermore, the flotation kinetics in the cell were shown to be unaffected by slurry rheology indicating the cell is best suited to niche application in the processing of ore types exhibiting highly viscous non-Newtonian behaviour...|$|R
