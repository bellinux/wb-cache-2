60|$|The {{place where}} we had first encamped {{at the foot of}} the {{mountain}} being very gloomy, we chose another in a kind of swamp near a stream overgrown with Zingiberaceous plants, in which a clearing was easily made. Here our men built two little huts without sides that would just shelter us from the rain; we lived in them for a week, shooting and insect-hunting, and roaming about the forests {{at the foot of the}} mountain. This was the country of the <b>great</b> <b>Argus</b> pheasant, and we continually heard its cry. On asking the old Malay to try and shoot one for me, he told me that although he had been for twenty years shooting birds in these forests he had never yet shot one, and had never even seen one except after it had been caught. The bird is so exceedingly shy and wary, and runs along the ground in the densest parts of the forest so quickly, that it is impossible to get near it; and its sober colours and rich eye-like spots, which are so ornamental when seen in a museum, must harmonize well with the dead leaves among which it dwells, and render it very inconspicuous. All the specimens sold in Malacca are caught in snares, and my informant, though he had shot none, had snared plenty.|$|E
60|$|In Ornithology {{there is}} a little {{uncertainty}} owing to the birds of Java and Sumatra being much better known than those of Borneo; but the ancient separation of Java as an island is well exhibited by the large number of its species which are not found in any of the other islands. It possesses no less than seven pigeons peculiar to itself, while Sumatra has only one. Of its two parrots one extends into Borneo, but neither into Sumatra. Of the fifteen species of woodpeckers inhabiting Sumatra only four reach Java, while eight of them are found in Borneo and twelve in the Malay peninsula. The two Trogons found in Java are peculiar to it, while of those inhabiting Sumatra at least two extend to Malacca and one to Borneo. There are {{a very large number of}} birds, such as the <b>great</b> <b>Argus</b> pheasant, the fire-backed and ocellated pheasants, the crested partridge (Rollulus coronatus), the small Malacca parrot (Psittinus incertus), the great helmeted hornbill (Buceroturus galeatus), the pheasant ground-cuckoo (Carpococcyx radiatus), the rose-crested bee-eater (Nyctiornis amicta), the great gaper (Corydon sumatranus), and the green-crested gaper (Calyptomena viridis), and many others, which are common to Malacca, Sumatra, and Borneo, but are entirely absent from Java. On the other hand we have the peacock, the green jungle cock, two blue ground thrushes (Arrenga cyanea and Myophonus flavirostris), the fine pink-headed dove (Ptilonopus porphyreus), three broad-tailed ground pigeons (Macropygia), and many other interesting birds, which are found nowhere in the Archipelago out of Java.|$|E

6000|$|This is what Chesterfield calls [...] "the porter-like {{language}} of Homer's heroes." [...] Such are the moods of Homer, {{so full of}} love of life and all things living, so rich in all human sympathies, so readily moved when the <b>great</b> hound <b>Argus</b> welcomes his master, whom none knew after twenty years, but the hound knew him, and died in that welcome. With all this love of the real, which makes him dwell so fondly on every detail of armour, of implement, of art; on the divers-coloured gold-work of the shield, on the making of tires for chariot-wheels, on the forging of iron, on the rose- tinted ivory of the Sidonians, on cooking and eating and sacrificing, on pet dogs, on wasps and their ways, on fishing, on the boar hunt, on scenes in baths where fair maidens lave water over the heroes, on undiscovered isles with good harbours and rich land, on ploughing, mowing, and sowing, on the furniture of houses, on the golden vases wherein the white dust of the dead is laid,--with all this delight in the real, Homer is the most romantic of poets. He walks with the surest foot in the darkling realm of dread Persephone, beneath the poplars on the solemn last beach of Ocean. He has heard the Siren's music, and the song of Circe, chanting as she walks to and fro, casting the golden shuttle through the loom of gold. He enters the cave of the Man Eater; he knows the unsunned land of the Cimmerians; {{in the summer of}} the North he has looked, from the fiord of the Laestrygons, on the Midnight Sun. He has dwelt on the floating isle of AEolus, with its wall of bronze unbroken, and has sailed on those Phaeacian barks that need no help of helm or oar, that fear no stress either of wind or tide, that come and go and return obedient to a thought and silent as a dream. He has seen the four maidens of Circe, daughters of wells and woods, and of sacred streams. He is the second-sighted man, and beholds the shroud that wraps the living who are doomed, and the mystic dripping from the walls of blood yet unshed. He has walked in the garden closes of Phaeacia, and looked on the face of gods who fare thither, and watch the weaving of the dance. He has eaten the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus, and from the hand of Helen he brings us that Egyptian nepenthe which puts all sorrow out of mind. His real world is as real as that in Henry V., his enchanted isles are charmed with the magic of the Tempest. His young wooers are as insolent as Claudio, as flushed with youth; his beggar-men are brethren of Edie Ochiltree; his Nausicaa is sister to Rosalind, with a different charm of stately purity in love. His enchantresses hold us yet with their sorceries; his Helen is very Beauty: she has all the sweetness of ideal womanhood, and her repentance is without remorse. His Achilles is youth itself, glorious, cruel, pitiful, splendid, and sad, ardent and loving, and conscious of its doom. Homer, in truth, is to be matched only with Shakespeare, and of Shakespeare he has not the occasional wilfulness, freakishness, and modish obscurity. He is a poet all of gold, universal as humanity, simple as childhood, musical now as the flow of his own rivers, now as the heavy plunging wave of his own Ocean.|$|R

50|$|Broadcast 2 December 1998, this {{programme}} discusses mating rituals. If a male bird is on {{the lookout}} for a partner and has a suitable nest, it must advertise the fact, either by its call, a visual display or both. The frigatebird provides an example of the latter, with its inflated throat pouch. The hornbill's courtship, among that of many others, also runs to the offer of a gift. For some species, dancing can also be an important component, and grebes are shown performing a pas de deux. The cock-of-the-rock, which dances solo within a group, is contrasted with the team performance of the manakin. Once trust has been established between a pair, mutual preening can follow. After mating, the individuals usually remain together to rear their eventual family.

5000|$|The double-banded argus, Argusianus bipunctatus, {{was long}} {{considered}} a potential second species. pheasant {{which is known}} only from the portion of a single primary flight feather. It was described in 1871 from this feather piece, found in a millinery shipment imported to London. Its origin was hypothesized to be from Java, Indonesia or Tioman Island of Malaysia, because of the great argus' absence from these locations. Parkes (1992) vehemently rejected the [...] "species" [...] validity and argued that the double-banded argus almost certainly represents a mutant form of the <b>great</b> <b>argus.</b> The IUCN, following the precautionary principle, listed this taxon as extinct until 2012. It {{was removed from the}} IUCN Red list because the IOC has removed this species from its list of valid bird taxa in 2011. While the feather is indeed quite distinct, it represents a fairly simple divergence: The entirely asymmetrically-pattern vanes are instead near-symmetrical and both bear the darker brown shaftward area with innumerable whitish speckles. The shaft is thinner than usual and the feather would probably not have been useful for flight.|$|E
50|$|The tragopans (Tragopan), mikado {{pheasant}} (Syrmaticus mikado), and {{several species of}} grouse and ptarmigan are exceptional in their largely vegetarian and arboreal foraging habitats; grouse are especially notable {{for being able to}} feed on plants rich in terpenes and quinones - such as sagebrush or conifers -, which are often avoided by other herbivores. Many species of moderate altitudes—for example the long-tailed pheasants of the genus Syrmaticus—also find a great deal of their daily nutritional requirements in the tree canopies, especially during the snowy and rainy periods when foraging on the ground is dangerous and less than fruitful for a variety of reasons. Although members of the genus Syrmaticus are capable of subsisting almost entirely on vegetarian materials for months at a time, this is not true for many of the subtropical genera. For example, the <b>great</b> <b>argus</b> (Argusianus argus) and crested argus may do most of their foraging during rainy months in the canopy of the jungle, as well.

We used CAM-TRACKER © camera trap data from one intensively surveyed study area and 10 sample plots located throughout the park. Camera traps were able to detect five species of pheasants and one partridge. The Sumatran peacock pheasant Polyplectron chalcurum and Salvadori’s pheasant Lophura inornata were restricted to forests with open understorey at higher elevations in the park, whereas <b>great</b> <b>argus</b> pheasants Argusianus argus were widespread in lowland areas having streams, open understorey and low human disturbance. In the study area, using <b>great</b> <b>argus</b> pheasant as an example, 29 % of the deployed cameras were able to detect the species.

We radiotracked six adult and one subadult males. Territories averaged 14. 5 ± 8. 5 ha, and home-range size did not vary by month or by relative abundance of selected plant foods. Daily travel distance (849 ± 211 m) varied significantly between months {{but did not}} reflect changes in plant foods. Territories were used almost exclusively by resident males. Males preferentially used undisturbed forest (habitat I). Vegetation structure at male display sites and random points indicated that display sites were located in undisturbed forest, with few lianas and small leaf size on trees adjacent to the display site. Between 1998 and 2001, we conducted five line-transect surveys in conjunction with camera-trap surveys. Density estimates of calling males varied from 0. 4 to 2. 5 males km− 2, and the total density estimate ranged from 0. 9 to 3. 7 birds km− 2. Density estimates increased substantially between 1998 and 2001, reflecting recovery from depressed densities after the 1997 - 1998 El Niño drought. Habitat occupancy estimates varied from 25 % to 38 % but {{were not significantly different}} over time. The proportion of occupied habitat was similar to the proportion of habitat I.

(ii) The 12 species of phasianine birds previously and presently studied belonged to three distinct branches. The first branch was made exclusively {{of members of the}} genus Gallus, while the second branch was made of pheasants of the genera Phasianus, Chrysolophus, and Syrmaticus.

(iii) The one perdicine species, Bambusicola thoracica, was more closely related to phasianine genera Gallus and Pavo than to members of other perdicine genera.

40|$|Tropical {{forests are}} {{becoming}} increasingly degraded and fragmented by logging, which can affect the survival of forest bird species in different ways. In this study, we present avifauna data collected from a monitoring programme in west-central Sumatra that set camera traps in three study areas with different habitat types, levels of degradation and protection status. From 5, 990 camera trap-nights, 248 independent bird photographs were recorded, comprising four orders and nine species, including three endemic species. The <b>Great</b> <b>Argus</b> Pheasant (Argusianus argus) was recorded in all study areas and most frequently (n = 202 photographs), followed by the threatened Salvadori's Pheasant (Lophura inornata). The greatest diversity of bird species (five) and abundance index (1. 44 bird photographs/loo trap-nights) was recorded from a primary hillsubmontane forest site located inside Kerinci Seblat National Park (KSNP) bordering degraded forest in a former logging concession recently repatriated into KSNP. However, inside a primary-selectively logged hill-submontane forest site spread over KSNP and an ex-logging concession, a Sumatran Ground Cuckoo (Carpococcyx viridis) was photographed. This species is noteworthy because prior to this study it had only been documented once since 1916. It is therefore crucial to use the camera trap results to increase the protection status for the ground cuckoo area. This has already happened {{in the other two}} study areas, where camera trap data have been used to reclassify the areas as Core Zones, the highest level of protection inside KSNP. This study illustrates how routine monitoring can have wider benefits through recording, and conserving, threatened and endemic non-target species in unexpected habitats that might not otherwise have been surveyed...|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} elucidating the {{evolutionary}} origin of junglefowls and their domestication processes, I conducted molecular evolutionary analyses of mitochondrial DNAs for various kinds of birds belonging to the subfamily Phasianinae. I then found that the real matriarchic origin of all the domestic fowls examined {{in the present study}} was an Asian continental population of Gallus gallus gallus. The phylogenetic analysis conducted in this study also suggested that the continental population of Gallus gallus gallus is the monophyletic ancestor of all domestic fowls. These findings resolve the long-time controversy concerning monophyletic versus polyphyletic origin theories of domestic fowls. 　The present thesis is composed of four chapters. In Chapter 1, as an introduction, I described {{the evolutionary}} significance of the domestication processes of junglefowls and the overview of taxonomical problems of birds within the subfamily Phasianinae, particularly junglefowls and domestic fowls. 　In Chapter 2, attention is focused on the molecular phylogeny of the subfamily Phasianinae. Comparisons of DNA sequences for mitochondrial control regions among 16 avian species belonging to the subfamily Phasianinae, revealed the following: (1) Generalized perdicine birds (quails and partridges) are descended from ancient lineages. Even the closest pair, the common quail of the Japanese subspecies (Coturnix coturnix japonica) and the Chinese bamboo partridge (Bambusicola thoracica), maintained only a 85. 7 l% identity. (2) The 12 species of phasianine birds previously and presently studied belong to three distinct branches. The first branch is made up exclusively of members of the genus gallus, while the second branch is made up of pheasants of the genera Phasianus, Chrysolophus and Syrmaticus. Gallopheasants of the genus Lophura are distant cousins to these pheasants. The <b>great</b> <b>argus</b> (Argusianus argus) and peafowls of the genus Pavo constitute the third branch. Members of the fourth phasianine branch, such as tragopans and monals, were not included in the present study. (3) The one perdicine species, Bambusicola thoracica, is more closely related to the phasianine genera Gallus and Pavo than to members of other perdicine genera. The above might indicate that Bambusicola belongs to one stem of the perdicine lineage which later split into two sublineages that yielded phasianine birds; one evolving to Gallus, while the other differentiated toward Pavo and related genera. (4) Tandem duplication of the 60 -base unit was established as a trait unique to the genus Gallus, which is shared neither by pheasant nor by quail. 　In Chapter 3, I discuss evolutionary relationships between red and green junglefowls. The noncoding control region of the mitochondrial DNA of various gallinaceous birds was studied with regard to its RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) and sequences of the first 400 bases. Unlike its close ally green junglefowl, the red junglefowl Gallus gallus is a genetically very diverse species; a 7. 0 % sequence divergence was seen between those from Thailand (Gallus gallus gallus and Gallus gallus spadiceus) and that of the Indonesian island of Java(Gallus gallus bankiva). Furthermore, the divergence increased to 27. 83 % when each transversion was regarded as an equivalent of 10 transitions. On the other hand, a mere 0. 5 - 3. 0 % difference (all transitions) separated various domestic breeds of chicken from two subspecies of Gallus gallus gallus of Thailand, thus indicating a single domestication event in the area inhabited by this subspecies, with the red junglefowl being the origin of all domestic breeds. Only transitions separated six diverse domesticated breeds. Nevertheless, a 2. 75 % difference was seen between RFLP type I breeds (white leghorn and nagoya) and a RFLP type VIII breed (ayam pelung). The above data suggest that although the mitochondrion of RFLP type V is the main contributor to domestication, hens of other RFLP types also contributed to this event. 　Finally, in Chapter 4, the evolutionary origin and dispersal patterns of domestic fowls are discussed from various. aspects of molecular evolution and human history. With the aim of elucidating in more detail, the genealogical origin of the present domestic fowls of the world, I determined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of the D-loop regions for a total of 21 birds which belong to the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) comprising three subspecies (6 Gallus gallus gallus, 3 Gallus gallus spadiceus and 3 Gallus gallus bankiva) and 9 birds representing diverse domestic breeds (Gallus gallus domesticus). I also sequenced mtDNAs from 4 green junglefowl (Gallus varius), 2 Cingalese junglefowl (Gallus lafayettei) and 1 grey junglefowl (Gallus sonnerati). I then constructed a phylogenetic tree for these birds using nucleotide sequences, choosing the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) as an outgroup. Moreover, I found that a continental population of Gallus gallus gallus was the real matriarchic origin of all the domestic species examined in the present study. It is also of particular interest to note that there were no discernible differences among Gallus gallus subspecies; Gallus gallus bankiva being a notable exception. This was because Gallus gallus spadiceus and a continental population of Gallus gallus gallus formed a single cluster in the phylogenetic tree. One obvious and distinct feature that customarily separates Gallus gallus gallus from Gallus gallus spadiceus is the color of their ear lobes: white for the former and red for the latter. The fact that domestic breeds of the chicken are of two kinds as to color of ear lobes is a clear reflection of the contribution made by Gallus gallus gallus as well as by Gallus gallus spadiceus to their ancestry. Gallus gallus bankiva, on the other hand, is a distinct entity, thus, deserving its subspecies status. This implies that a continental population of Gallus gallus gallus was the monophyletic ancestor of all domestic breeds. I also discuss the possible significance of the initial dispersal pattern of present domestic fowls, utilizing the phylogenetic tree...|$|E
