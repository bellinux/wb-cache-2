5000|$|In the EU {{the system}} is known as <b>ISOFIX</b> and covers both Group 0/0+ and Group 1 child safety seats. The {{mechanism}} for attaching the seat to the Lower Anchors {{is quite different from}} that in the United States. In the EU two [...] "alligator-like" [...] clips connect the seat to the Lower Anchors rather than the open clip style connectors commonly used in the United States. However, some child seat manufacturers are beginning to offer true <b>ISOFIX</b> type attachments in the U.S. In the European standard, there are also various installation categories: [...] "universal", [...] "vehicle-specific" [...] and [...] "semi-universal". The main difference is that [...] "Universal" [...] represents use of a top tether strap with the <b>ISOFIX</b> anchorage, [...] "vehicle-specific" [...] represents the usage of the <b>ISOFIX</b> anchorage without the top tether in specified vehicles only, while [...] "Semi-Universal" [...] represents usage of the <b>ISOFIX</b> anchorage together with a [...] "foot-prop".|$|E
50|$|In 1990, the ISO {{standard}} <b>ISOFIX</b> {{was launched}} {{in an attempt to}} provide a standard for fixing car seats into different makes of car. The standard now includes a top tether; the U.S. version of this system is called LATCH. Generally, the <b>ISOFIX</b> system can be used with Groups 0, 0+ and 1.|$|E
50|$|The center-to-center {{distance}} between the anchors of <b>ISOFIX</b> (and also LATCH) systems is 280 mm.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Isofix</b> is {{designed}} to secure a maximum combined weight (comprising both seat and child) of 33kg.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Isofix</b> (known as LATCH in the US) {{system was}} {{developed}} jointly by child safety seat maker Britax-Römer and automobile maker Volkswagen, {{with the first}} compatible products released in 1997. However at the US DOT's request, Britax filed a series of [...] "Terminal Disclaimers" [...] to waive all its <b>ISOFIX</b> patent rights and dedicate the patents to the public good, so the US LATCH regulations could be established in 1998.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the current}} UN/ECE R14, all new {{vehicles}} produced since February 2013 {{are required to}} have <b>ISOFIX</b> lower anchorages and top tether attachments.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ISOFIX</b> {{system was}} {{developed}} jointly by child safety seat maker Britax-Roemer and automobile maker VW, {{with the first}} compatible products released in 1997.|$|E
50|$|On September 19, 2014, the Australian {{government}} legalized {{the use of}} <b>ISOFIX</b> child seats. Prior to this date, their sale (and use) in Australia was illegal.|$|E
50|$|Group 0 baby seats, or infant carriers, {{keep the}} baby {{locked up in}} a {{rear-facing}} position and are secured in place by a standard adult seat belt and/or an <b>ISOFIX</b> fitting.|$|E
50|$|Amendments {{to include}} <b>ISOFIX</b> in UN ECE Regulations 14 & 44, which specify uniform {{provisions}} {{for the design}} of vehicle seat anchorages and child safety seats, came into force in February 2004.|$|E
50|$|<b>ISOFIX</b> is International Organisation for Standardisation {{standard}} ISO 13216, which specifies {{the anchoring}} system for Group 1 child safety seats. It defines standard attachment points to be manufactured into cars, enabling compliant child safety seats to be quickly and safely secured. <b>ISOFIX</b> {{is an alternative}} to securing the seat with seat belts. Seats are secured with a single attachment at the top (top tether) and two attachments {{at the base of}} each side of the seat. The full set of anchor points for this system were required in new cars in the United States starting in September 2002.|$|E
50|$|As of 2015, dual SRS airbags, three-point seatbelts, ABS, <b>Isofix,</b> {{side impact}} beams are {{standard}} on all models. Stability control {{is available on}} some markets. An immobilizer is only offered in G and Veloz trims.|$|E
50|$|The Honda FR-V allows {{folding down}} the front middle seat to create a tray or arm rest. The compact MPV offers around 32 {{different}} seating combinations, three <b>ISOFIX</b> points and lots of cabin and load space.|$|E
50|$|The airbag variant tested was the Malaysian model {{equipped}} with six airbags, Electronic Stability Control (ESC), and <b>Isofix.</b> The non-airbag variant tested was the Thai version, which is similarly equipped as the Philippine and Indonesian models.|$|E
50|$|Regional {{differences}} include <b>ISOFIX</b> points standard both Opel, Vauxhall and Holden models {{while the}} Holden Cascada also has top-tether mounts. Excluding Holden all Buick, Opel and Vauxhall (Elite trim from 2016) Cascadas include GM's OnStar System as of 2016 as GM expands the service into Europe.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of boosters: high back (some of which have energy {{absorbing}} foam) and no back. A new generation of booster seats comes with rigid <b>Isofix</b> (Latch) connectors that secure to the vehicle's anchors, improving the seat's stability {{in the event of}} a collision.|$|E
50|$|The European version, with {{exceptions}} for the French and Turkish market, {{includes a}} standard ESP electronic stabilization program with Hill Hold Control, head-thorax airbags (integrated {{in the front}} seatbacks), belt tensioners and belt force limiters plus seatbelt warning indicator and head restraints, three rear head restraints and <b>Isofix</b> child seat preparation.|$|E
50|$|Seating {{for five}} was standard, with two third-row buckets optional. With all the rear seats removed, there {{was up to}} 3,000 litres of cargo space. A 120 kg {{capacity}} slide-out boot floor was optional. Roof rails were standard on Trend and Ambiente models, while <b>ISOfix</b> anchorages were included on all vehicles.|$|E
50|$|By law {{every child}} {{restraint}} sold in Australia must carry the Australian Standard AS/NZ1754 sticker (pictured right).Most overseas child restraints, including restraints from Europe and the USA, do {{not comply with}} these Standards and cannot legally be used in Australia. This also applies for <b>ISOFIX</b> child restraints imported from Europe or the USA.|$|E
50|$|However, until May 9, 2008 {{member states}} may have {{permitted}} the use of child restraint systems approved {{in accordance with their}} national standards. EuroNCAP has developed a child-safety-protection rating to encourage improved designs. Points are awarded for universal child-restraint anchorages <b>ISOFIX,</b> the quality of warning labels and deactivation systems for front-passenger airbags.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the UHSS reinforced body structure, Proton has also equipped twin front airbags for all variants of the new Saga. Other passive safety features include two <b>ISOFIX</b> child seat mounts with top tethers, head restraints and five three-point seat belts, with pre-tensioning for front passengers and an audible driver's seat belt reminder.|$|E
5000|$|<b>ISOFIX</b> is the {{international}} standard for attachment points for child safety seats in passenger cars. The system has other regional names including LATCH ("Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children") in the United States and UAS ("Universal Anchorage System") or Canfix in Canada. It has also been called the [...] "Universal Child Safety Seat System" [...] or UCSSS.|$|E
50|$|The Modus was {{the first}} small car to receive the full 5 Euro NCAP stars for {{passenger}} safety {{due in part to}} its six airbag system, front and rear side impact bars and <b>ISOFIX</b> child seat fixing points. It {{was also one of the}} first cars in its class to have such features as automatic headlamps and windscreen wipers on its options list.|$|E
