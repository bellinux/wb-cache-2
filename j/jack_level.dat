50|$|Wellington Marist's Jack Duffy was {{the only}} player to play in both the 1946 final and the 1932 final, Marist's {{previous}} Chatham Cup win. The 1946 team also contained {{three members of the}} Nunns family: Ces, Des, and Ray Nunns. Marist dominated the final, but it was Tech who took the lead in front of a crowd of 8000, with Cyril Thomas scoring during the first half. <b>Jack</b> Hatchard <b>levelled</b> for Marist before the break, then took the lead early in the second half through Henry Bell.|$|R

50|$|Arsenal had led 1-0 with a Bob John goal, but Newcastle's {{equaliser}} {{came after}} a long ball that had appeared to foul over the goal line, and was put back into action for a goal kick. Newcastle winger Jimmy Richardson crossed the ball back into the field and <b>Jack</b> Allen <b>levelled</b> the match for the Magpies. The referee ruled that the ball had not gone out of play, but photographic evidence later showed that the ball had crossed the line; the goal stood. Allen scored again {{in the second half}} to win the match 2-1.|$|R
50|$|Mackenroth was a {{competitive}} swimmer {{in elementary and}} high school and continued competing after college at the Masters <b>level.</b> <b>Jack</b> has earned three All-American titles and in the summer of 2006, he set a national record for the breaststroke leg of the 4 x 50 meter relay at the Masters World Championships in Stanford, California.|$|R
50|$|Two {{versions}} of gun were produced. One used a travelling carriage, {{for use by}} batteries in the field army. This consisted of a wheeled carriage (Carriage Mk I or Mk III) with four folding outrigger trails and <b>levelling</b> <b>jacks.</b> The wheels were {{lifted off the ground}} or removed when the gun was brought into action.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} season, 1931–32, Arsenal {{reached the}} FA Cup final again, losing controversially to Newcastle United. Arsenal had led 1–0 with a Bob John goal, but Newcastle's equaliser {{came after a}} long ball had gone over the goal line, and out for a goal kick; Newcastle winger Jimmy Richardson nevertheless crossed the ball back into play and <b>Jack</b> Allen <b>levelled</b> the match for the Magpies; Allen scored again {{in the second half}} to win the match 2–1. Arsenal's pain was {{compounded by the fact that}} Everton had pipped them to the League title; a poor start to the 1931–32 campaign meant Arsenal played catch-up for most of the season, finishing two points adrift.|$|R
50|$|C models {{feature a}} Amlogic {{system on a chip}} (SoC), while XU models feature a Exynos SoC. Both include an ARM central {{processing}} unit (CPU) and an on chip graphics processing unit (GPU). CPU architectures include ARMv7-A and ARMv8-A, a board memory range from 1 GB RAM to 2 GB RAM. Secure Digital SD cards are used to store the operating system and program memory in either the SDHC or MicroSDHC sizes. Most boards have between three and five mixed USB 2.0 or 3.0 slots, HDMI output, and a 3.5 mm <b>jack.</b> Lower <b>level</b> output is provided by a number of general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins which support common protocols like I²C. Current models have an Gigabit Ethernet (8P8C) port and eMMC module socket.|$|R
50|$|He was an ever-present in the {{successful}} FA Cup campaign in 1932, in which Newcastle defeated Arsenal {{in the final}} in rather controversial circumstances. Arsenal took an early lead, when Joe Hulme beat Fairhurst and centred the ball to Bob John who easily beat goalkeeper Albert McInroy. Newcastle's equaliser came after a long ball had appeared {{to go over the}} goal line, and out for a goal kick; Newcastle winger Jimmy Richardson nevertheless crossed the ball back into play and <b>Jack</b> Allen <b>levelled</b> the match for the Magpies.

50|$|To {{set up for}} operation, {{the trailer}} was parked on {{suitably}} flat land and the brakes were locked. Three <b>levelling</b> <b>jacks</b> were then swung out from the trailer, one on either side at the front where the step in the chassis met the cabin, and another {{from the rear of}} the cabin. The jacks were then used to level the cabin using spirit levels. The radar dishes were then raised, the generator started, and operations could begin. The entire setup took about 20 minutes, with 3 minutes required to warm up the electronics.|$|R
50|$|On a {{pitch that}} was heavy {{after a lot}} of rain, England made the better start winning more {{possession}} from the scrum than the Australians and this pressure led to the first try when Alan Edwards scored in the corner. A Gus Risman penalty increased England's lead to 5-0 before Australia drew level with a try from winger Arch Crippin. Retrieving a dropped England pass on his own 25 yd line Crippin ran the length of the pitch beating fullback Brough to score under the posts, leaving a simple conversation for <b>Jack</b> Beaton to <b>level</b> the scores.|$|R
50|$|Green Archer {{comprised}} {{two units}} each {{mounted on a}} four-wheel trailer with <b>levelling</b> <b>jacks,</b> one unit was the complete radar, the other a fully silenced generator inaudible at 200 m to permit operation in forward areas. The radar unit weighed 2,915 kg and with the antenna in the operating position was 2.9 m high. The radar display was positioned up to about 15 metres from the radar and had a built in simulator for training. Each radar and generator was usually towed by a Humber 1 ton armoured vehicle, or the FV610 version of the Saracen six-wheel armoured vehicle. Each radar section was supported by an electronic repair vehicle which carried a spare {{for each of the}} 13 major sub-assemblies in each radar.|$|R
500|$|Finally, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{decides to}} be {{committed}} to his girlfriend, Elisa Pedrera (Salma Hayek), as Elisa wants to take their relationship to the next <b>level.</b> <b>Jack</b> persuades Elisa to cancel her annual trip to Puerto Rico so that the two can spend time together. As a result, Jack devotes a whole week to Elisa at exactly {{the same time as the}} economic crisis unfolds, forcing Jack to steer General Electric (GE) through the Asian market crash. After a video tape of GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn) surfaces—taped in the event of a financial meltdown—Geiss says [...] "it is the end, and love is all that matters", which makes Jack realize his love for Elisa. He proposes marriage to her, which she accepts. The day after, Elisa leaves Jack for Puerto Rico.|$|R
25|$|During the 19th century {{it became}} {{uneconomical}} to mine for the salt. Instead hot water was pumped through the mines, which dissolved the salt. The resultant brine was pumped {{out and the}} salt extracted from the brine. This technique weakened the mines and led to land subsidence as they collapsed. Subsidence affected {{the town and the}} surrounding landscape. For example, collapses in 1880 formed Witton Flash as the River Weaver flowed into a huge hole caused by subsidence. Subsidence also allegedly accounts for many old timber-framed houses in the town centre, which were better able to withstand the movement of the ground. Some houses were built on a base of steel girders that could be <b>jacked</b> up to <b>level</b> the house with each change in the underlying ground. The town's historical link with the salt industry is celebrated in its museum, which is today located in the old workhouse.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{particle}} type, size, content and manufacturing process on the creep behaviour of wood particles/High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) composites has been investigated. Short-term creep tests at different temperatures {{were carried out}} and modelled using the Bürger's model and the Findley power law. The creep of the composites was found to increase with temperature due to the mobility of the amorphous bulk and tie HDPE molecules. Increased wood particle content generally decreased the creep <b>level.</b> <b>Jack</b> pine composites exhibited the highest creep reduction due to the chemical composition of the fibres surface and the efficiency of adhesion mechanism between fibres and the HDPE. Injection and compression processes led to better creep behaviour than the extrusion process {{due to differences in}} the composites microstructures. Particle size did not show important impacts on the creep properties. Findley power law led to better prediction of long time creep behaviour of the composites...|$|R

40|$|For the {{transport}} of their spacecraft from the vehicle assembly building to the launch pads at Kennedy Space Centre, Florida, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is using two special crawler transporters since 1965. First developed for the Saturn V rocket the crawler transporters have been sufficient for all following generations of space ships so far. But for {{the new generation of}} Orionspacecraft which is under development now, a load capacity increase for the crawler transporter of plus 50 % was necessary. For this task Hunger Hydraulik did develop new <b>jacking,</b> equalizing and <b>levelling</b> (JEL) cylinders with sufficient load capacity but also with some new features to improve the availability, reliability and safety of this system. After design approval and manufacture of the cylinders they have been tested in a special developed one-to-one scale dynamic test rig and after passing this the cylinders had to prove their performance in the crawler transporter itself. This article describes the general application and introduces the technical requirements of this project as well as the realized solution...|$|R
40|$|Evidence is {{building}} {{to suggest that}} both chronic and acute warm temperature exposure, {{as well as other}} anthropogenic perturbations, may select for small adult fish within a species. To shed light on this phenomenon, we investigated physiological and anatomical attributes associated with size-specific responses to an acute thermal challenge and a fisheries capture simulation (exercise+air exposure) in maturing male coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Full-size females were included for a sex-specific comparison. A size-specific response in haematology to an acute thermal challenge (from 7 to 20 °C at 3 °C h− 1) was apparent only for plasma potassium, whereby full-size males exhibited a significant increase in comparison with smaller males (‘jacks’). Full-size females exhibited an elevated blood stress response in comparison with full-size males. Metabolic recovery following exhaustive exercise at 7 °C was size-specific, with <b>jacks</b> regaining resting <b>levels</b> of metabolism at 9. 3 ± 0. 5 h post-exercise in comparison with 12. 3 ± 0. 4 h for full-size fish of both sexes. Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption scaled with body mass in male fish with an exponent of b = 1. 20 ± 0. 08. Jacks appeared to regain osmoregulatory homeostasis faster than full-size males, and they had higher ventilation rates at 1 h post-exercise. Peak metabolic rate during post-exercise recovery scaled with body mass with an exponent of b~ 1, suggesting that the slower metabolic recovery in large fish was not due to limitations in diffusive or convective oxygen transport, but that large fish simply accumulated a greater ‘oxygen debt’ that took longer to pay back at the size-independent peak metabolic rate of ~ 6 mg min− 1 kg− 1. Post-exercise recovery of plasma testosterone was faster in jacks compared with full-size males, suggesting less impairment of the maturation trajectory of smaller fish. Supporting previous studies, these findings suggest that environmental change and non-lethal fisheries interactions have the potential to select for small individuals within fish populations over time...|$|R
