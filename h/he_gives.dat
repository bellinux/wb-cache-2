5|$|George King as Mr. Flak, Amber, Link, and Tracy's history teacher. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> Tracy {{detention}} when Amber frames Tracy {{of drawing}} {{a picture of}} him with breasts. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> Link detention as well for coming to Tracy's defense.|$|E

5|$|T-series: 40¢. This {{series is}} listed in Tuck's Encyclopedia, but <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> no {{examples}} in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may therefore not exist.|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>gave</b> {{the value}} of pi (≈ 3.14159) to be [...] ≈ 3.1746 in 1544. Later, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> [...] ≈ 3.1333 and, in De rebus mathematicis (1556), <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> [...] ≈ 3.1410.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>gave</b> it a look. Then <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> me a look, and I didn't {{like his}} eye.|$|R

5|$|Bede's {{work as a}} hagiographer, and his {{detailed}} {{attention to}} dating, were both useful preparations for the task of writing the Historia Ecclesiastica. His interest in computus, the science of calculating the date of Easter, was also useful in the account <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> of the controversy between the British and Anglo-Saxon church over the correct method of obtaining the Easter date.|$|E
5|$|Dr.Dre {{has stated}} {{that he is a}} perfectionist and is known to {{pressure}} the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances. In 2006, Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn.com that Dr.Dre had made new artist Bishop Lamont re-record a single bar of vocals 107times. Dr.Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his similar work ethic. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> a lot of input into the delivery of the vocals and will stop an MC during a take if it is not to his liking. However, <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> MCs that he works with room to write lyrics without too much instruction unless it is a specifically conceptual record, as noted by Bishop Lamont in the book How to Rap.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, Cassidy says {{goodbye to}} Vitayakul and Min. Before leaving, <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> them {{a picture of}} Sofia and asks them {{to hold on to}} it until he has found her. He then sets out in search of his daughter.|$|E
60|$|And, being blind as {{he always}} has been, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> the wrong things to the wrong people--in fact, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> them just as {{indicated}} above.|$|R

5000|$|Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni {{was also}} accused of subverting the East African Community by marginalising {{the leaders of}} Burundi and Tanzania by not {{inviting}} them for the talks. Freedon and Unity Front leader General David Sejusa said: [...] "He started that rebellion. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> them arms, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> them financial support, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> them equipment, and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> them uniforms. So, it's not like I’m talking out of the blue. But, then, the chameleon he is, he turns around and then he postures as if he's the one who wants to bring peace." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic. He returns {{to the idea that}} {{theology}} and mystical philosophies (<b>he</b> <b>gives</b> the examples of Vedanta, Spinoza, Hegel, and Bradley) will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine of the Mystery of God, he maintains this is because the intellect is inherently incapable of understanding the Ultimate. All attempts to state the nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.|$|E
5|$|Katsuo Nakamura as Masayoshi Harada, Sota's grandfather. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> {{many words}} of wisdom to Sota, and gently advises Sota not to hate anyone or bear any grudges for the {{circumstances}} and predicaments in his life. He later dies due to a long-running illness.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Joey is in a {{hospital}} room of his own, where a doctor informs him that he's suffering from kidney stones. As they're too close to his bladder, Joey is given two options: wait until he passes them naturally, or have a procedure, which he finds too invasive. Opting for the former, <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> 'birth' to the kidney stones, concurrent with Phoebe’s birth.|$|E
5000|$|Fue a mí a quien le dio permiso = [...] "It was me to whom <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> permission", lit. [...] "It {{was to me}} to whom <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> permission" ...|$|R
60|$|I thanked him, {{staring at}} him far {{beyond the bounds of}} good manners, and holding tight to Joe. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> Joe good-night, and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> Mr. Wopsle good-night (who went out with us), and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> me only a look with his aiming eye,--no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may be done with an eye by hiding it.|$|R
50|$|When {{her husband}} {{came to the}} throne, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> her the posthumous title of Queen Jeongsun and after her son became king <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> her the posthumous title of Queen Mother Sungyeong.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, an {{independent}} trader, Cyrano Jones (Stanley Adams), arrives {{on the station}} with some tribbles. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> one to Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), who brings it on board the Enterprise, where it and its quickly-produced offspring are treated as adorable pets. The animals purr a relaxing trill that the crew find soothing. Klingons, however, find tribbles annoying, and the feeling is mutual: tribbles hiss and shriek whenever they are near Klingons.|$|E
5|$|Montauran, on {{the other}} hand, is devoted wholly to the royalist cause, and chafes against the ignorant nobles {{supporting}} it. He fights for the Chouan cause because he believes in it, not for the personal gain sought by the aristocrats in whose midst he works. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> up the cause for Marie, but only {{as a result of}} an unclear series of events, the product of everyone's intertwined double-crossing.|$|E
5|$|Pausanias' account {{agrees with}} that of Herodotus (whom he {{probably}} read) except that <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> the number of Locrians, which Herodotus declined to estimate. Residing in the direct path of the Persian advance, they gave all the fighting men they had - according to Pausanias 6,000 men - which added to Herodotus' 5,200 would have given a force of 11,200.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>gave</b> {{away his}} last $7 million in late 2016, {{to the same}} {{recipient}} of his first charitable donations: Cornell. Over {{the course of his}} life, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> away more than $8 billion.|$|R
50|$|When President Barack Obama visited Kenya in July 2015, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> an {{exclusive}} one-on-one interview on 98.4 Capital FM, {{one of the}} only two one-on-one radio interviews that <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> during that visit.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>gave</b> {{the music}} to the film Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy along with Ajay Atul which was very popular. Recently, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> {{the music to}} the film Natsamrat and also acted in it.|$|R
5|$|Scrooge awakens on Christmas {{morning a}} changed man. He spends {{the day with}} Fred's family and {{anonymously}} sends a large turkey to the Cratchit home for Christmas dinner. The following day <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> Cratchit an increase in pay and becomes like another father to Tiny Tim. From then on Scrooge began to treat everyone with kindness, generosity and compassion, embodying the spirit of Christmas.|$|E
5|$|When Michael {{finds out}} about Kevin's predicament, <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> Kevin his condolences, but subtly remains bitter that Kevin is ruining his {{birthday}} fun. Dwight and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) are less subtle than {{they think they}} are being when discussing their secret relationship within earshot of Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak). After goofing around at the store, Jim and Pam return to the office.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{puts the}} Alamanni force at around 35,000. This is {{consistent}} with two other figures <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> for Alamannic armies elsewhere in his history: an army of 40,000 in 378; and in 366 an army divided in three, with one division 10,000 strong. Nevertheless, several historians regard Ammianus' figure as unrealistically high. It has been recently suggested that in reality the Alamanni at Strasbourg may have been only about 15,000, {{much the same as}} the Romans. This calculation {{is based on the assumption}} that the average reported size of Alamanni raiding-bands (800 men) represented the maximum manpower of a pagus. For various reasons, the midpoint figure between these two extremes (about 25,000 men) appears the most likely scenario.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>gave</b> {{the people}} of his best: [...] His worst he kept, his best <b>he</b> <b>gave.</b> [...] My Shakespeare's curse on [1] clown and knave [...] Who will not let his ashes rest! ...|$|R
50|$|In 1868, however, Bellew {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism, his mother's faith. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> up Anglican holy orders on 13 August 1870. In so doing <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> up {{an income of}} around £1,000 a year.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> a solo {{performance}} titled [...] "Maati Re", choreographed by Kumudini Lakhia. In 2010, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> a duet {{performance with}} Sanjukta Sinha {{and this was}} choreographed by Kumudini Lakhia as well.|$|R
5|$|An Australian POW {{that was}} freed in the raid, Private Walter Gossner of the 2/15th Battalion, {{provided}} an extremely {{detailed account of}} his experiences about {{being part of a}} group of 87 POWs freed by Partisans from a location near Ožbalt. <b>He</b> <b>gives</b> the date of the raid as 27 September 1944, four weeks after the date given by Churches. His account has been posted on the internet by his family. Gossner states that he arrived at Semič 21 days after the raid, and his account varies significantly from that of Churches. It is not known why Gossner's dates and other details of his account differ so markedly from Churches' account.|$|E
5|$|An example <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> of the {{difficulty}} of obtaining missing data from drug companies is that of oseltamivir (Tamiflu), manufactured by Roche to reduce the complications of bird flu. Governments spent billions of pounds stockpiling this, based in large part on a meta-analysis that was funded by the industry. Bad Pharma charts the efforts of independent researchers, particularly Tom Jefferson of the Cochrane Collaboration Respiratory Group, to gain access to information about the drug.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, TGS star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tries to film a {{commercial}} for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America but has a difficult time remembering his line resulting in production holding traffic up as the commercial shoot is blocking off a street. Jack comes upon the scene and realizes the problem. To speed things up, <b>he</b> <b>gives</b> Tracy jelly beans to eat and while he is chewing, Jack imitates Tracy's voice and says the line Tracy was scheduled to say.|$|E
60|$|HELP. Then said <b>he,</b> <b>Give</b> me thy hand; so <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> him his hand, and he {{drew him}} out, and set him upon sound ground, and bid him go {{on his way}} (Psa. 40:2).|$|R
6000|$|... "I asked nothing," [...] said poor Susie--"I {{only took}} what <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> me. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> me {{no more than}} he had to--he was beautiful," [...] she went on. [...] "He is, thank God, interested." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor I a braver servant," [...] {{said the}} King. Then <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> him the gifts {{and kissed him}} before all men. To Skallagrim also <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> a good byrnie of Welsh steel {{coloured}} black.|$|R
