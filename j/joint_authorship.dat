25|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>authorship</b> of articles, {{in which}} {{different}} users participate in correcting, editing, and compiling the finished product, {{can also cause}} editors to become tenants in common of the copyright, {{making it impossible to}} republish without permission of all co-owners, some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing. However, where persons contribute to a collective work such as an encyclopedia, there is no joint ownership if the contributions are separate and distinguishable. Despite most wikis' tracking of individual contributions, the action of contributing to a wiki page is still arguably one of jointly correcting, editing, or compiling, which would give rise to joint ownership.

We examine the intermediate features of a standard CNN trained for landmark detection and show that features extracted from later, more specialized layers capture rough landmark locations. This provides a natural means of applying differential treatment midway through the network, tweaking processing based on facial alignment. The resulting Tweaked CNN model (TCNN) harnesses the robustness of CNNs for landmark detection, in an appearance-sensitive manner without training multi-part or multi-scale models. Our results on standard face landmark detection and face verification benchmarks show TCNN to surpasses previously published performances by wide margins.

500|$|Modern {{scholarship}} inclines to {{the view}} that L'incoronazione was the result of collaboration between Monteverdi and others, with the old composer playing a guiding role. Composers who may have assisted include Sacrati, Benedetto Ferrari and Francesco Cavalli. Ringer suggests that Monteverdi's age and health may have prevented him from completing the opera without help from younger colleagues; he speculates about an arrangement resembling [...] "the workshop of Rubens, who might design a painting and handle the important details himself but leave the more mundane aspects... to younger apprentice artists." [...] The musicologist Alan Curtis believes that [...] only a single collaborator was involved, and published his 1989 edition of L'incoronazione under the <b>joint</b> <b>authorship</b> of Monteverdi and Sacrati. The musical analyst Eric Chafe's study of Monteverdi's tonal language supports the collaboration theory and postulates that some of the sections in question, including the prologue, the coronation scene and the final duet, reflect Monteverdi's intentions and may have been written under his direct supervision.|$|E

40|$|To begin, we want {{to place}} our title in context. Many people that we have met {{throughout}} our careers assumed that we were Murray’s graduate students – because (we think) the first author was a student in his research group in the 1970 s, both of us received our graduate degrees from North-eastern University, and we have pursued {{some of the same}} research interests that interested him. In reality, that is an honor that we can-not claim. We were not his students in the strictest sense of that relationship. Our advisor was Larry Stoddard. Our research with Larry had a somewhat differ-ent focus than the main thrust of Murray’s work. We focused mainly on stimulus control processes involved in functional communica-tion of persons with little or no functional language. We published many papers with Larry as professional colleagues, but we have no <b>joint</b> <b>authorships</b> with Murray. Moreover, when we were junior researchers, Murray was burdened with administrative jobs and split work sites (Northeastern University in Boston and the Shriver Center in Waltham). We saw him only rarely – mostly in those occasional research meetings that he could attend. After he retired, we saw him only a little more. Thus, we cannot even claim de facto post-graduate student relationships (much as we would have liked such an ar-rangement if circumstances had permitted). Despite this history, we do claim Murray as our teacher – because that is a fact. In the new APA Handbook of Behavior Analysis, the first author (2012) wrote this dedication: This chapter is dedicated to Murray Sidman, who taught us how to think scientifically [emphasis added here] through his writing and our too-infrequent personal contacts over many years [...] .

2500|$|In the United States {{and some}} {{other parts of the}} world it has been largely {{superseded}} by Gregg shorthand, which was first published in 1888 by John Robert Gregg. This system was influenced by the handwriting shapes that Gabelsberger had introduced. Gregg's shorthand, like Pitman's, is phonetic, but has the simplicity of being [...] "light-line." [...] Pitman's system uses thick and thin strokes to distinguish related sounds, while Gregg's uses only thin strokes and makes some of the same distinctions by the length of the stroke. In fact, Gregg claimed <b>joint</b> <b>authorship</b> in another shorthand system published in pamphlet form by one Thomas Stratford Malone; Malone, however, claimed sole authorship and a legal battle ensued. The two systems use very similar, if not identical, symbols; however, these symbols are used to represent different sounds. For instance, on page 10 of the manual is the word d i m 'dim'; however, in the Gregg system the spelling would actually mean n u k or 'nook'.|$|E
40|$|W. Barsalou have <b>joint</b> senior <b>authorship.</b> Psychological {{construction}} {{approaches to}} emotion suggest that emotional experience is situated and dynamic. Fear, for example, is typically studied {{in a physical}} danger context (e. g., threatening snake), but in the real world, it often occurs in social contexts, especially those involving social evaluation (e. g., public speaking). Understanding situated emotional experience is critical because adaptive responding is guided by situational context (e. g., inferring the intention of another in a social evaluation situation vs. monitoring the environment in a physical danger situation). In an fMRI study, we assessed situated emotional experience using a newly developed paradigm in which participants vividly imagine different scenarios from a first-person perspective, in this case scenarios involving either social evaluation or physical danger. We hypothesized that distributed neural patterns would underlie immersion in social evaluation and physical danger situations, with shared activity patterns across both situations in multiple sensory modalities and in circuitry involved in integrating salient sensory information, andwith unique activity patterns for eac...|$|R

Prominent examples for this class of robots are the robots developed at the JSK laboratory of the University of Tokyo and the robots developed by the EU-funded project Embodied Cognition in a Compliantly Engineered Robot (Eccerobot).

40|$|The authors assert equal {{contribution}} and <b>joint</b> first <b>authorship.</b> Abstract—Metric maps {{provide a}} reliable basis for mobile robot navigation. However, such maps are in general quite resource expensive {{and do not}} scale very well. Aiming for a highly scalable map, we adopt theories of insect navigation to develop an algorithm which builds a topological map for global navigation. Similar to insect conduct, positions in space are memorized as snapshots, which are unique configurations of landmarks. Unlike conventional snapshot approaches, we do not simply store the landmarks as a set, but we build a landmark tree which enables us to easily free memory {{in case of a}} continuously growing map while still preserving the dominant information. The resulting navigation is not sensor specific and solely relies on the directions of arbitrary landmarks. The generated map enables a mobile robot to navigate between defined locations and let it retrace a previously pursued path. Finally, we verify the reliability of the Landmark-Tree Map (LT-Map) concept and its robustness on memory limitations.

60|$|What {{was even}} more to Louise was the admirable {{behavior}} of her father {{when she went to}} eat humble-pie before him. He laughed at the notion of Godolphin's meddling with the play, and scolded her for not taking her husband's view of the case, which he found entirely reasonable, and the only reasonable view of it. He argued that Godolphin simply chose to assert in that way a claim to <b>joint</b> <b>authorship,</b> which he had all along probably believed he had, and he approved of Maxwell's letting him have his head in the matter, so far as the West was concerned. If he attempted to give it with any alterations of his own in the East, there would be time enough to stop him. Louise seized the occasion to confirm herself in her faith that her father admired Maxwell's genius as much as she did herself; and she tried to remember just the words he used in praising it, so that she could repeat them to Maxwell. She also committed to memory his declaration that the very fact of Godolphin's playing the piece every now and then was proof positive that he would be very reluctant to part with it, if it came to that. This seemed to her very important, and she could hardly put up with Maxwell's sardonic doubt of it.|$|E
6000|$|Just at this time, order {{came out}} of {{confusion}} {{in the affairs of}} Covent Garden.

On hearing of this, Goldsmith made overtures to Colman; who, without waiting to consult his fellow proprietors, who were absent, gave instantly a favorable reply. Goldsmith felt the contrast of this warm, encouraging conduct, to the chilling delays and objections of Garrick. He at once abandoned his piece to the discretion of Colman. [...] "Dear sir," [...] says he in a letter dated Temple Garden Court, July 9th, [...] "I am very much obliged to you for your kind partiality in my favor, and your tenderness in shortening the interval of my expectation.

60|$|In {{fact the}} critics had found {{themselves}} {{confronted with a}} task which is always confusing to criticism, in the necessity of valuing {{a work of art}} so novel in material that it seems to refuse the application of criterions. As he followed their struggles in the endeavor to judge his work by such canons of art as were known to them, instead of taking it frankly upon the plane of nature and of truth, where he had tried to put it, and blaming or praising him as he had failed or succeeded in this, he was more and more bowed down within himself before the generous courage of Godolphin in rising to an appreciation of his intention. He now perceived that {{he was a man of}} far more uncommon intelligence than he had imagined him, and that in taking his play Godolphin had shown a zeal for the drama which was not likely to find a response in criticism, whatever its fate with the public might be. The critics frankly owned that in spite of its defects the piece had a cordial reception from the audience; that the principal actors were recalled again and again, and they reported that Godolphin had spoken both for the author and himself in acknowledging the applause, and had disclaimed all credit for their joint success. This made Maxwell ashamed of the suspicion he had harbored that Godolphin would give the impression of a <b>joint</b> <b>authorship,</b> at the least. He felt that he had judged the man narrowly and inadequately, and he decided that as soon as he heard from him, he would write and make due reparation for the tacit wrong he had done him.|$|E
40|$|A. Wingler and S. Purdy share <b>joint</b> first <b>authorship?</b> The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the genetic basis of sugar-regulated senescence and to explore the relationship with other traits, including flowering and nitrogen-use efficiency. ? Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for senescence were mapped in the Arabidopsis Bay- 0 ? Shahdara recombinant-inbred line (RIL) population after growth on glucose- containing medium, which accelerates senescence. The extent of wholerosette senescence was determined by imaging the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv ? Fm). ? A major QTL on the top of chromosome 4 colocalized with FRI, a major determinant of flowering. This QTL interacted epistatically with a QTL on chromosome 5, where the floral repressor FLC localizes. Vernalization accelerated senescence in late-flowering lines with functional FRI and FLC alleles. Comparison with previous results using the Bay- 0 ? Shahdara population showed that rapid rosette senescence on glucose-containing medium was correlated with early flowering and high sugar content in compost-grown plants. In addition, correlation was found between the expression of flowering and senescence-associated genes in Arabidopsis accessions. However, an additional QTL on chromosome 3 was not linked to flowering, but to nitrogen-use efficiency. ? The results show that whole-rosette senescence is genetically linked to the vernalization- dependent control of flowering, but is also controlled by flowering-independent pathways. preprintPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2011. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Symbiont redundancy in obligate insect–fungal systems {{is thought to}} buffer the insect host against symbiont loss and to extend the environmental conditions under which the insect can persist. The mountain pine beetle is associated with at least three well-known and putatively obligate ophiostomatoid fungal symbionts that vary in their environmental tolerances. To better understand the spatial variation in beetle–fungal symbiotic associations, we examined the community composition of ophiostomatoid fungi associated with the mountain pine beetle {{as a function of}} latitude and elevation. The region investigated represents the leading edge of a recent outbreak of mountain pine beetle in western Canada. Using regression and principal components analysis, we identified significant spatial patterns in fungal species abundances that indicate symmetrical replacement between two of the three fungi along a latitudinal gradient and little variation in response to elevation. We also identified significant variation in the prevalence of pair-wise species combinations that occur within beetle galleries. Frequencies of pair-wise combinations were significantly different from what was expected given overall species abundances. These results suggest that complex processes of competitive exclusion and coexistence help determine fungal community composition and Amanda D. Roe and Patrick M. A.

40|$|Substantial {{national}} attention is being directed at enhancing the competency levels of early careerist in academia {{and other areas}} of employment. Higher education’s climate demands increasing levels of written output from academics which puts pressure on supervisors to want to publish with or from students’ doctoral thesis as lead or co-authors. The prospects of this emanate from the well-known adage of “Publish or perish”. Supervisors, in their need to publish themselves, may consider that their names {{be included in the}} listing of authors on all publications from the students’ theses or dissertations. Many scholars would argue that publishing with your graduate student is ethical if you have written or edited the manuscript whereas others hold the opinion that supervision of the research project without actually writing or editing a manuscript is sufficient to warrant inclusion as an author. A third situation arises when a student does not attempt to publish his/her thesis or dissertation. To many faculties, this seems a loss of their efforts spent guiding the student. Some faculty even believe that if the student doesn’t publish his/her research within a specified period of time, the supervising faculty has the right to publish the research as primary author. The purpose of this presentation is to raise a debate on graduate research supervision and <b>joint</b> student-supervisor <b>authorship.</b> I propose the position that publishing with graduate students should not be seen as payback time for the supervisory role and recommend that students’ plans for publication be discussed early in the supervisory process with agreed upon roles in manuscript preparation be clearly delineated and agreed up.

6000|$|Our {{next meeting}} was at Hartford, or, rather, at Springfield, where Clemens greeted {{us on the}} way to Hartford. Aldrich was going on to be his guest, and I was going to be Charles Dudley Warner's, but Clemens had come part way to welcome us both. In the good {{fellowship}} of that cordial neighborhood we had two such days as the aging sun no longer shines on in his round. There was constant running in and out of friendly houses where the lively hosts and guests called one another by their Christian names or nicknames, and no such vain ceremony as knocking or ringing at doors. Clemens was then building the stately mansion in which he satisfied his love of magnificence {{as if it had been}} another sealskin coat, and he was at the crest of the prosperity which enabled him to humor every whim or extravagance. The house was the design of that most original artist, Edward Potter, who once, when hard pressed by incompetent curiosity for the name of his style in a certain church, proposed that it should be called the English violet order of architecture; and this house was so absolutely suited to the owner's humor that I suppose there never was another house like it; but its character must be for recognition farther along in these reminiscences. The vividest impression which Clemens gave us two ravenous young Boston authors was of the satisfying, the surfeiting nature of subscription publication. An army of agents was overrunning the country with the prospectuses of his books, and delivering them by the scores of thousands in completed sale. Of the 'Innocents Abroad' he said, [...] "It sells right along just like the Bible," [...] and 'Roughing It' was swiftly following, without perhaps ever quite overtaking it in popularity. But he lectured Aldrich and me on the folly of that mode of publication in the trade which we had thought it the highest success to achieve a chance in. [...] "Anything but subscription publication is printing for private circulation," [...] he maintained, and he so won upon our greed and hope that on the way back to Boston we planned the <b>joint</b> <b>authorship</b> of a volume adapted to subscription publication. We got a very good name for it, as we believed, in Memorable Murders, and we never got farther with it, but by the time we reached Boston we were rolling in wealth so deep that we could hardly walk home in the frugal fashion by which we still thought it best to spare car fare; carriage fare we did not dream of even in that opulence.|$|E
