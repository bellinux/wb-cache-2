5|$|A third update {{was applied}} to Gears of War 2 on March 24, 2009. The update added an experience-based ranking {{system in which the}} player is given a {{numerical}} value based on their amount of experience points, which are gained by shooting or killing <b>enemies</b> <b>in</b> public multiplayer. The update also addressed several issues with matchmaking, including adding bots in place of players who have quit or lost connection to the game.|$|E
5|$|According to Diodorus, Philip {{marched on}} his <b>enemies</b> <b>in</b> this {{alliance}} {{before they had}} chance to combine, and forced them to ally to Macedon instead. However, other sources suggest that the picture was actually much more complex, and that Philip in turn defeated each of the powers {{over the next few}} years, with the exception of Athens.|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, Sachsen {{joined the}} German fleet, which was tasked {{primarily}} with coastal defense against France and Russia, who were {{presumed to be}} the most likely <b>enemies</b> <b>in</b> a continental war. In the early 1880s, heightened tensions with Russia prompted the naval command developed more offensively-minded contingencies. These formed the basis for the annual summer fleet maneuvers, in which Sachsen took part.|$|E

5|$|Alisia {{attacks by}} {{shooting}} streaks of lightning from her hands. The attack automatically targets <b>enemies</b> <b>in</b> range but gets weaker with each volley as Alisia's power is depleted. Her power recharges when she stops attacking; when fully charged, it {{allows her to}} unleash a multi-target attack, hitting every enemy on the screen. The energy system introduces an element of strategy, encouraging the player to manage Alisia's power to have her able to defend herself at critical moments.|$|E
5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{introduces}} a new ability system, Tactical Soul system, to the Castlevania series. It involves absorbing {{the souls of}} <b>enemies</b> <b>in</b> order to gain additional abilities. Except for human enemies and the game's final opponent, all souls can be absorbed by the player. The rate at which enemies' souls are obtained varies between enemies. Players can trade souls between two Aria of Sorrow cartridges using two Game Boy Advance consoles and a link cable.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Ecgberht was in exile, Francia was ruled by Charlemagne, who {{maintained}} Frankish influence in Northumbria {{and is known}} to have supported Offa's <b>enemies</b> <b>in</b> the south. Another exile in Gaul at this time was Odberht, a priest, who is almost certainly the same person as Eadberht, who later became king of Kent. According to a later chronicler, William of Malmesbury, Ecgberht learned the arts of government during his time in Gaul.|$|E

5|$|Parthia {{had always}} posed {{a threat to}} Rome in the east, but the real battlefront was along the Rhine and Danube rivers. Before the final fight with Antony, Octavian's campaigns against the tribes in Dalmatia were {{the first step in}} {{expanding}} Roman dominions to the Danube. Victory in battle was not always a permanent success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Rome's <b>enemies</b> <b>in</b> Germania.|$|E

5|$|Taiwanese Plains Aborigines {{were often}} {{employed}} and dispatched as interpreters {{to assist in}} the trade of goods between Han merchants and Highlands aborigines. The aborigines traded cloth, pelts and meat for iron and matchlock rifles. Iron was a necessary material for the fabrication of hunting knives—long, curved sabers that were generally used as a forest tool. These blades became notorious among Han settlers, given their alternative use to decapitate Highland indigenous <b>enemies</b> <b>in</b> customary headhunting expeditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} of the Byzantine emperor as the legitimate Roman emperor was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Imperator Augustus by Pope Leo III in the year 800. Needing Charlemagne's support in his struggle against his <b>enemies</b> <b>in</b> Rome, Leo used {{the lack of a}} male occupant of the throne of the Roman Empire at the time to claim that it was vacant and that he could therefore crown a new Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} {{inconsistencies}} {{from the}} naturalist's view point. Foxes and badgers are not necessarily mutual <b>enemies</b> <b>in</b> nature. Badgers do not normally invade the homes of foxes, and are not typically dirty. Badgers do sometimes eat bunnies, not from a predilection for bunnies but {{simply because they are}} omnivorous. The inconsistencies are few and employed to create individual characters rather than evoke an archetypical fox and badger.|$|E

5|$|A {{recovered}} Herkus Monte raided Culmerland {{with a large}} {{force and}} took many prisoners in 1263. On {{his way back to}} Natangia, Herkus and his men were confronted by a contingent of their <b>enemies.</b> <b>In</b> the Battle of Löbau that ensued, Prussians killed forty knights, including the Master and the Marshal. The Prussians also received help from Lithuanians and Sudovians. In summer of 1262 Treniota and Shvarn attacked Masovia, killing Duke Siemowit I, and raided Culmerland, provoking Pogesanians to join the uprising. However, assassination of Mindaugas and subsequent dynastic fights prevented Lithuanians from further campaigns. Skalmantas, leader of Sudovians, raided Culm (Chełmno) in 1263 and in 1265.|$|E
