40|$|International audienceKey messageThe {{potential}} of <b>European</b> National <b>Forest</b> Inventories to harmonise stem quality estimation in <b>European</b> <b>forests</b> was identified despite considerable differences in existing national approaches. ContextKnowledge on stem quality and assortments structure in <b>European</b> <b>forests</b> is highly important for {{policy makers and}} the timber industry and also for carbon life cycle analysis {{due to the fact}} that different timber products have different end use and thus store carbon for different time periods. AimsThe study aim was to evaluate the {{potential of}} <b>European</b> National <b>Forest</b> Inventories (NFI) to objectively report on the stem quality in <b>European</b> <b>forests</b> in a harmonised manner. MethodsA comprehensive questionnaire was conducted as the first important step to evaluate the current status of stem quality assessment and assess the existing level of harmonisation. ResultsDirect stem quality assessment or classification is used in 19 out of 28 European NFIs. Only eight countries provide timber assortment estimates from their NFIs. In addition, different sampling strategies for stem quality assessment are used among NFIs. Tree parameters relevant for stem quality assessment on standing trees were identified for the purpose of harmonisation. Several methods towards harmonisation between European NFIs for the purpose of reporting on stem quality of <b>European</b> <b>forests</b> were suggested. ConclusionCurrent European NFIs are not capable of reporting the stem quality of <b>European</b> <b>forests</b> in a harmonised manner at this stage and considerable efforts will need to be taken before the harmonised stem quality estimation can be prepared. However, the inquiry also revealed that there is a potential to develop the harmonised estimations in future...|$|R

30|$|Material flow {{analysis}} (MFA) {{is a method}} focusing {{on the amount of}} material used in a production chain and assesses the impacts the process causes (Hendriks et al. 2000). In MFA, a certain unit of raw material fed into a system, is examined (e.g. an industry, household, region) that produces certain outputs from the system. MFA calculates all the inputs needed in the process and outputs that the inputs produce. MFA normally considers loadings of inputs and outputs instead of their concentrations (Hendriks et al. 2000). In the context of forestry, a MFA-model called ToSIA (Tool for Sustainability Impact Assessment) has been developed by the <b>European</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>Institute</b> (Wolfslehner et al. 2011). In ToSIA, material flows are calculated in tons of organic carbon and the impacts are calculated by using multipliers for each material unit used in each process resulting in an impact total (Tuomasjukka et al. 2013 b). The results of MFA can be used to compare scenarios or to examine the material flow in an individual chain (e.g. den Herder et al. (2012).|$|E
