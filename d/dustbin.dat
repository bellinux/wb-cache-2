5|$|<b>Dustbin</b> Baby is a BBC {{television}} film directed by Juliet May, based on Jacqueline Wilson's 2001 {{novel of the}} same name. It was first broadcast on BBC One on 21 December 2008. The film stars Dakota Blue Richards as April, a troubled teenager who was abandoned in a <b>dustbin</b> as an infant, and Juliet Stevenson as Marion Bean, April's adoptive mother. David Haig stars as Elliot, Marion's friend and colleague. The screenplay was written by Helen Blakeman, and the film was produced by Kindle Entertainment. <b>Dustbin</b> Baby deals with themes including maternal bonding, bullying, and youth crime. The story revolves around April running away on her fourteenth birthday, while Marion searches for her. April's life is recounted in flashbacks as she meets people and visits places that are significant to her.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, <b>Dustbin</b> Baby {{was one of}} four {{works of}} children's {{television}} shortlisted for the International Emmy Award in the children and young people category at the 37th International Emmy Awards. The other nominations were Lharn Poo Koo E-Joo (produced by Workpoint Entertainment), The Little Emperor's Christmas (produced by Rede Globo), and Mille (produced by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation). The film was one of nine nominations for the UK, which had more than any other nation. The film won the award, making it one of six International Emmys for the UK, and one of three for the BBC, in 2009. <b>Dustbin</b> Baby was also shortlisted for the British Academy Children's Awards in the drama category, along with The Sarah Jane Adventures (also by the BBC), S4C's Rhestr Nadolig Wil, and the online show following boyband US5. The ceremony was held on 29 November at The London Hilton on Park Lane and hosted by Dick and Dom. <b>Dustbin</b> Baby lost out to Rhestr Nadolig Wil. Blakeman was shortlisted for the British Academy Children's Award for best writer, thanks to her screenplay for <b>Dustbin</b> Baby, and won. The film was also entered into the BAFTA Kids' Vote in the television category. Children aged between seven and fourteen were able to vote for their favourite television show from a choice also featuring Blue Peter, Dani's House, Newsround, Prank Patrol, The Sarah Jane Adventures, Hannah Montana, Phineas & Ferb, iCarly, and SpongeBob SquarePants. The Kids' Vote was won by Hannah Montana.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Smart waste {{management}} {{in a city}} is significantly manifested by the optimal distribution of waste collection points (<b>dustbins).</b> Evidently, inadequate number of <b>dustbins</b> coupled with improper management may trigger pollution to a great extent. Waste collection using insufficient street <b>dustbins</b> is a widely used way of solid {{waste management}} in Dhaka city. Yet an uncomforting scenario of air pollution is prevailing in different wards of Dhaka. The reasons can be put forth as inadequate and unequal distribution of municipal <b>dustbins,</b> improper management including waste overflow {{and the lack of}} awareness in usage among the people. In this context, an attempt has been made in this paper to obtain a quantitative analysis between existing <b>dustbins</b> and their serving population. This study first analyses the spatial distribution of <b>dustbins</b> in some areas of Dhaka city employing average nearest neighbor functions of GIS. Interestingly, the spatial distribution of the existing <b>dustbins</b> has shown to be predominantly in clustered pattern. Next, an optimal number of additional <b>dustbins</b> were calculated. An additional number of 20 and 8 <b>dustbins</b> are required in areas (wards) # 34 and # 35 in Dhaka city. We also examined the extent of pollution caused by the existing <b>dustbins</b> using spatial analyst functions of GIS. It is found that all the <b>dustbins</b> are burst with wastes and causing pollution to the ground surface and air. The results thus obtained would help to understand the present scenario of the waste management of Dhaka city and to optimally place the required number of <b>dustbins</b> to prevent further pollution to environment. 1...|$|R

5|$|Both Wilson {{and critics}} responded {{positively}} to the film, with Wilson saying {{she thought it}} was the best film adaptation of any of her works. It was released on DVD on 12 January 2009. <b>Dustbin</b> Baby was awarded the International Emmy in the Children and Young People category at the 2009 ceremony. Helen Blakeman won a Children's BAFTA for the screenplay, while the film itself was shortlisted for a Children's BAFTA in the Drama category and shortlisted for the Kids' Vote award. The film was also awarded the 2010 KidScreen Award for Best One-off, Special, or TV movie aimed at a Family Audience and the KidScreen Award for Best Acting.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} of the sticky bomb for physical humour has frequently proved too tempting to be neglected, a good example being David Niven's novel Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly. The unfortunate officer Stanni, while attempting to demolish a smelly privy, loses his dignity and a large section of trouser fabric to such an incident. The sticky bomb also featured in the British television comedy series Dad's Army. In the episode Fallen Idol Lance-Corporal Jack Jones sticks his grenade to an improvised target and retires as instructed but keeps a hold of the grenade which is now primed and stuck to an old <b>dustbin</b> lid.|$|E
5|$|She often {{bears the}} brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and {{in part due to}} her aloof nature. One such {{occasion}} saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn Â£500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the <b>dustbin.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{flashback}} jumps {{forward to}} April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). A {{piece of work}} on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from {{going out on a}} Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number {{on the side of a}} <b>dustbin.</b> Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.|$|E
25|$|The end {{of history}} is, alas, also {{the end of the}} dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for {{disposing}} of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a <b>dustbin.</b> It has become its own <b>dustbin,</b> just as the planet itself is becoming its own <b>dustbin.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1974, Tamiaki Yoneya {{discovered}} {{that all the}} known string theories included a massless spin-two particle that obeyed the correct Ward identities to be a graviton. John Schwarz and Joel Scherk came {{to the same conclusion}} and made the bold leap to suggest that string theory was a theory of gravity, not a theory of hadrons. They reintroduced KaluzaâKlein theory as a way of making sense of the extra dimensions. At the same time, quantum chromodynamics was recognized as the correct theory of hadrons, shifting the attention of physicists and apparently leaving the bootstrap program in the <b>dustbin</b> of history.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the extraterrestrial hypothesis, a variety of possible explanations for flying saucers have been put forward. One {{of the most common}} states that most photos of saucers were hoaxes; cylindrical metal objects such as pie tins, hubcaps and <b>dustbin</b> lids were easy to obtain, and the poor focus seen in UFO images makes the true scale of the object difficult to ascertain. However, some photos and movies were deemed authentic after intensive study. An example was the saucer-like object photographed by farmer Paul Trent near Portland, Oregon in 1950, which passed all tests when studied by the Condon Committee in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} investigations at the site, which was cordoned off {{soon after the}} incident and screened by the investigating agencies, improvised explosive device (IED) was recovered from a metal <b>dustbin,</b> though no residue of the explosives, remains of any circuit or detonator were found, the device did not have shrapnel in it, thus there were no burn or shrapnel injuries, and all the injured were hit by pieces of wall that broke following the explosion, all suggesting the use of plastique explosive, PETN, TNT or C4. Early results revealed used of Semtex, a general-purpose plastic explosive containing RDX and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN); however, the final report of the Forensic Science Institute, Gujarat is awaited.|$|E

25|$|At 11:15 that morning, Fred {{formally}} {{admitted to}} police he had indeed killed his daughter, albeit {{in an act}} of manslaughter. He confessed to strangling Heather in a fit of rage before dismembering her body in the ground floor bathroom with a heavy serrated knife he normally used for cutting slabs of frozen meat. Her remains had been stored in a <b>dustbin</b> as he waited for an opportunity to dig her grave. Fred was insistent his wife had no knowledge of her daughter's murder, claiming he had committed this murder as Rose was preoccupied with one of her clients, adding the fact the search team had not yet unearthed Heather's remains was because they had been excavating the wrong section of his garden. He then volunteered to accompany police to the house to pinpoint the precise location of Heather's body. Upon receipt of this confession, Fred's solicitor, Howard Ogden, and his appointed appropriate adult, Janet Leach, informed Mae and Stephen their father had confessed to their sister's murder. In response, Stephen slumped against a wall and began sobbing; Mae entered a state of shock, before stammering that her father had not killed her sister.|$|E
25|$|String theory {{eventually}} {{made it out}} of the <b>dustbin,</b> but for the following decade all work on the theory was completely ignored. Still, the theory continued to develop at a steady pace thanks to the work of a handful of devotees. Ferdinando Gliozzi, Joel Scherk, and David Olive realized in 1977 that the original Ramond and Neveu Schwarz-strings were separately inconsistent and needed to be combined. The resulting theory did not have a tachyon, and was proven to have space-time supersymmetry by John Schwarz and Michael Green in 1984. The same year, Alexander Polyakov gave the theory a modern path integral formulation, and went on to develop conformal field theory extensively. In 1979, Daniel Friedan showed that the equations of motions of string theory, which are generalizations of the Einstein equations of general relativity, emerge from the renormalization group equations for the two-dimensional field theory. Schwarz and Green discovered T-duality, and constructed two superstring theoriesâIIA and IIB related by T-duality, and type I theories with open strings. The consistency conditions had been so strong, that the entire theory was nearly uniquely determined, with only a few discrete choices.|$|E
