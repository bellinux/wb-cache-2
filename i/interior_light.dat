In 1889 the Tacoma Building replaced the bolted metal design with a stronger riveted approach, and Chicago's Chamber of Commerce Building introduced <b>interior</b> <b>light</b> courts to the structural design of skyscrapers. The 1890 Rand McNally Building became {{in the first}} entirely self-supporting, steel-framed skyscraper. Some buildings, such as The Rookery and the Monadnock Building, combined elements of both the newer and older styles, but generally Chicago rapidly adopted steel structures as a flexible and effective way to produce a range of tall buildings. Structural engineers specializing in the steel frame design began to establish practices in Chicago.|$|E

Production of these machines evolved over time. [...] During 1951, the wooden bodies were replaced with sheet steel and these vehicles were powered by Chrysler flathead six-cylinder engines and 3-speed manual transmissions. In the1960s, V-8engines began to appear and during the 1969/1970 production years, the standard round [...] "porthole"-style windows were replaced with larger rectangular windows which allowed more <b>interior</b> <b>light</b> and made them feel less claustrophobic. Following these changes came the switchover to more reliable Chrysler Industrial 318 engines with the automatic Loadflite transmissions. Production of these machines continued into the mid-1970s.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{cars have}} at least one [...] "dome light" [...] (or [...] "courtesy light") located in or near the ceiling of the {{passenger}} compartment, to provide illumination by which to fasten seatbelts and enter or exit the car. These often have an option to switch on when the front (or any) passenger doors are opened. Many vehicles have expanded this feature, causing the overhead <b>interior</b> <b>light</b> to remain on after all doors are closed, allowing passengers to fasten seat belts with added illumination. The extended lighting cycle usually ends when the vehicle's ignition has begun, or a gradual reduction in light emitted after a couple of minutes if the car isn't started, called [...] "theater" [...] lighting. Interior lighting has been added on some vehicles at the bottom edge of the dashboard, which illuminates the floor for front passengers, or underneath the front seats at the rear, to illuminate the floor for rear seat passengers. This type of convenience lighting approach is also sometimes used to illuminate interior or exterior door handles, exterior step running boards, or electric window switches.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first batch}} of 44 Class 357/0 units were ordered {{at a cost}} of £200 million by Prism Rail in March 1997 to replace the Class 310 slam-door units, and allow the return of 18 hired Class 317 units to their other {{franchise}} West Anglia Great Northern. Construction started in 1999, and they are currently leased by c2c from Porterbrook. They were built in the green LTS Rail colour scheme, painted with a white livery with dark green doors and underskirt (bottom body panels). Their interior consists of dark green seat moquette with alternating rows of large flecks of light blue and light green, light green plastic seat tops with slots in the side for reservation tickets (which are not used) with dark green insets, a stone pattern linoleum floor, purple plastic <b>interior,</b> <b>light</b> green handrails and metal luggage racks with large circular perforations and light green edges, and dark green stickers on the inter-carriage gangway doors. The [...] "door out of order" [...] display is in between the interior door buttons, with the door close button above and the door open button below, unlike in the 357/2 units. These units were fitted with the voice of Julie Berry. See 1973 tube stock for info on her announcement career.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of its completion, the Post Office Building {{contained}} the largest uninterrupted enclosed space in the city. Its clock tower reached [...] into the air. It was also the city's first building to have a steel frame structure, and the first to be built with electrical wiring incorporated into its design. The structure featured elevators with cages of highly intricate wrought iron, a glass covered atrium and mezzanine level, and floors, moldings, railings, and wainscoting made of marble. The atrium was [...] high, and 10 floors of balconies looked out onto the space (which provided <b>interior</b> <b>light</b> in an era when indoor lighting was not common). It boasted more than 39,000 interior electric lights, and its own electrical generator. Girders and catwalks spanned the atrium at the third floor level to allow post office supervisors to look down on the workers. The fifth floor housed executive offices in the corners. Each office had a turret, ornately carved wooden moldings, and red oak paneling. But there were problems with the structure. The Washington Star newspaper reported that the skylights and windows leaked air and water, the marble floors were poorly laid, and much of the construction was shoddy. The ninth floor was to have served as a file room, but a post-construction inspection showed it could not accommodate the weight. Technological advances in electricity and electrical wiring, mechanical engineering, movement of air, heating, and more made the building out of date as soon as it opened.|$|E
60|$|But the favours which Xavier {{received}} from heaven, made him large amends {{for all the}} injuries of hell; for though the particulars of what passed betwixt God and him were kept secret, it is known, at least in regard of the principal affair, for which he consulted God, {{that he had an}} <b>interior</b> <b>light,</b> which gave him clearly to understand, that he was commanded to pass to the more southern islands, and to labour in their conversion. The Christian, strength, with which he found himself animated at the same time, caused all the dangers, which naturally he might apprehend, to disappear, as is manifest by what he wrote from Meliapor on that occasion, to two of his friends at Goa, Paul de Camerin, and James Borba, of whom we have made so frequent mention.|$|E
6000|$|If Dante's philosophy, {{on the one}} hand, was {{practical}} a {{guide for}} the conduct of life, it was, on the other, a much more transcendent thing, whose body was wisdom her soul love, and her efficient cause truth. It is a practice of wisdom from the mere love of it, for so we must interpret his amoroso uso di sapienzia, when we remember how he has said before[103] that [...] "the love of wisdom for its delight or profit is not true love of wisdom." [...] And this love must embrace knowledge in all its branches, for Dante is content with nothing less than a pancratic training, and has a scorn of dilettanti, specialists, and quacks. [...] "Wherefore none ought to be called a true philosopher who for any delight loves any part of knowledge, as there are many who delight in composing Canzoni, and delight to be studious in them, and who delight to be studious in rhetoric and in music, and flee and abandon the other sciences which are all members of wisdom."[104] [...] "Many love better to be held masters than to be so." [...] With him wisdom is the generalization from many several knowledges of small account by themselves; it results therefore from breadth of culture, and would be impossible without it. Philosophy is a noble lady (donna gentil),[105] partaking of the divine essence by a kind of eternal marriage, while with other intelligences she is united in a less measure [...] "as a mistress of whom no lover takes complete joy."[106] The eyes of this lady are her demonstrations, and her smile is her persuasion. [...] "The eyes of wisdom are her demonstrations by which truth is beheld most certainly; and her smile is her persuasions in which the <b>interior</b> <b>light</b> of wisdom is shown under a certain veil, and in these two is felt that highest pleasure of beatitude which is the greatest good in paradise."[107] [...] "It is to be known that the beholding this lady was so largely ordained for us, not merely to look upon the face which she shows us, but that we may desire to attain the things which she keeps concealed. And as through her much thereof is seen by reason, so by her we believe that every miracle may have its reason in a higher intellect, and consequently may be. Whence our good faith has its origin, whence comes the hope of those unseen things which we desire, and through that the operation of charity, by the which three virtues we rise to philosophize in that celestial Athens where the Stoics, Peripatetics, and Epicureans through the art of eternal truth accordingly concur in one will."[108] ...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in vehicle <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> for both functional and esthetic purposes. Although {{a large body of}} research has developed over many years on nighttime driver vision and vehicle exterior lighting, there has traditionally been little research attention to <b>interior</b> <b>lighting.</b> This report includes a brief review of some of the research that has been done, and presents the results of a nighttime field study that was performed to contribute to the understanding of how vehicle <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> affects some basic aspects of driver vision. Participants in the study were asked to perform two tasks while seated in a stationary experimental car on a closed test road at night: (1) detecting pedestrians on the road ahead, and (2) rating the subjective brightness of a reflected veiling light on the windshield. The veiling light was varied in both luminance and color. The results indicated that pedestrian detection was closely related to photopic photometric measures, suggesting the pedestrian task was influenced primarily by cone photoreceptors, while the rating of subjective brightness appeared to show an influence of rod photoreceptors. These results have implications for how the photometry of vehicle <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> should be performed in order to give the best correlation with driver visual performance. Future research should further quantify the effects observed here and investigate changes in retinal adaptation associated with automotive <b>interior</b> <b>lighting...</b>|$|R
