The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of fertilization and <b>interseeding</b> cover crops on the yield of forage maize, number and dry weight of weeds. Three cover crops, fall rye (Secale cereale L.), hairy vetch (Vicia villosa L.) and berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.), were interseeded in maize furrows (Zea mays L.).

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of fertilization and <b>interseeding</b> cover crops on the growth of main crops and weeds and the stability of weed suppression over years and main crop species under four-year rotational organic farming. Two cover crops, winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), were interseeded in furrows of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), soybean (Glycine max Merr.) and maize (Zea mays L.) at 3 - 5 weeks after planting the main crops. The number and dry weight of weeds were measured at the maximum plant height stage of main crops and main crop yields were recorded at their physiological maturity. The light competition between main crops, cover crops and weeds was analyzed by vertical community structure and vegetation cover ratio (VCR) of each crop. Since light competition of main crops with cover crops and weeds was not severe, main crop yields were not suppressed significantly by either cover crops or weeds. Weed growth was suppressed significantly by <b>interseeding</b> cover crops through increasing the VCR of main crops plus cover crops. This weed suppression by <b>interseeding</b> cover crops was stable to the main crop species in rotational cropping systems and to the various environmental conditions, because the cover crops compensated the low VCR of main crops alone at early growth stage especially when main crop growth was depressed by unfavorable environmental conditions. In addition, input of compost and fermented organic fertilizer had positive effects on the main crop yield and weed suppression. It is concluded, therefore, that weeds can be suppressed effectively and stably without yield reductions of main crops by <b>interseeding</b> cover crops with sufficient fertilization in organic farming systems...|$|E
40|$|Golf {{is a key}} {{industry}} that generates jobs, commerce, economic development, and tax revenues for communities throughout the United States. A survey conducted in Iowa showed that golf generated 769. 6 million dollars in total economic output while providing over 10, 000 jobs to the state. The integrity of turf swards is routinely compromised by invasion from annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.), {{and higher levels of}} inputs are needed to maintain acceptable quality. New cultivars of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) offer improved agronomic characteristics and are better able to resist invasion from annual bluegrass. The overall objective of this research was to evaluate the culture of creeping bentgrass cultivars and assess the practice of <b>interseeding</b> as a means of converting existing putting greens to recently developed cultivars. Recently developed cultivars of creeping bentgrass possess finer leaf texture and more upright leaf architecture. These morphological characteristics allow for increased shoot densities. Results from our research suggest that a greater number of shoots hinders the plant 2 ̆ 7 s ability to recuperate from injury. Our work also demonstrated that cultivars of creeping bentgrass displayed varying lateral spread rates and stolon and internode lengths. Growth analysis revealed that low shoot density cultivars allocate more dry matter into stolons than leaves. Difference in dry matter partitioning could partially explain differences in lateral spread among cultivars of creeping bentgrass. Higher shoot density cultivars may be better suited for areas where low populations of annual bluegrass are desired. Alternatively, lower shoot density cultivars may be better suited for areas where mechanical damage is frequent and recuperative potential is important. The vegetative characteristics should be matched with desired site usage requirements for optimum performance when selecting cultivars of creeping bentgrass. The ability of established facilities to utilize recently developed cultivars is limited as few conversion methods exist. Current renovation methods require a facility to incur significant financial loss. <b>Interseeding</b> has been proposed as an alternative conversion method with less financial burden. Germination studies showed that recently developed cultivars of creeping bentgrass possess greater vigor and may be better suited for <b>interseeding</b> compared with older cultivars. Our <b>interseeding</b> studies suggest that the level of maintenance and overall quality of the putting surface influence the success of conversion. Conversion through <b>interseeding</b> in this study was not successful when the plots were maintained under golf course conditions. <b>Interseeding</b> was only successful when conditions of the putting green were allowed to deteriorate below acceptable levels. The overall conditioning of the putting surface in order to permit <b>interseeding</b> needs to be weighed against the cost of a traditional conversion when deciding on a renovation program...|$|E

40|$|In {{assessing}} {{the role of}} biomass in alleviating potential global warming, the absence {{of information on the}} sustainability of biomass production on soils of limited agricultural potential is cited as a major constraint to the assessment of the role of biomass. Research on the sustainability of yields, recycling of nutrients, and emphasis on reduced inputs of agricultural chemicals in the production of biomass are among the critical research needs to clarify optimum cropping practice in biomass production. Two field experiments were conducted between 1989 and 1993. One study evaluated biomass production and composition of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) grown alone and with bigflower vetch (Vicia grandiflora L.) and the other assessed biomass productivity and composition of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) grown alone and with perennial legumes.

Apart from the absence of a gold marker, the studied seed has an identical design to the OptiSeed 103 [Phys. Med. Biol. 50, 1493 - 1504 (2005) ]; [Appl. Radiat. Isot. 63, 311 - 321 (2005) ]. Polymer encapsulation was preferred by IBt {{in order to reduce the}} quantity of radioactive material needed for a given dose rate and to reduce the anisotropy of the radiation field around the seed. In addition, this design is intended to decrease the <b>interseed</b> effects that can occur as a result of the marker and the encapsulation. Dosimetric measurements were performed using LiF thermoluminescent dosimeters (1 mm 3) in solid water phantoms (WT 1). Measured data were compared to Monte Carlo simulated data in solid water using the MCNP code, version 4 C. Updated cross sections [Med. Phys. 30, 701 - 711 (2003) ] were used. As the measured and calculated data were in agreement, Monte Carlo calculations were then performed in liquid water to obtain relevant dosimetric data as required by TG- 43 U 1 recommendations. Comparison of the results with previous studies of OptiSeed 103 [Phys. Med. Biol. 50, 1493 - 1504 (2005) ]; [Appl. Radiat. Isot. 63, 311 - 321 (2005) ], and of InterSource 103 [Appl. Radiat. Isot. 57, 805 - 811 (2002) ] showed very good agreement for the dose rate constant and for the radial dose function. With respect to the anisotropy function, the relative dose (anisotropy value relative to 90 degrees) from the polymer seed at a distance of 3 cm was close to unity (105 %) at 0 degrees, whereas the relative values for the OptiSeed 103 with a gold marker and the titanium-encapsulated InterSource 103 seed decreased to 70 % and 40 %, respectively. The <b>interseed</b> effect from one seed was negligible and in the order of calculation uncertainty, making calculation of the dose rate distribution of the studied seeds, according to TG 43 U 1 recommendations, more accurate and closer to reality. This feasibility study shows that due to the low energy of palladium- 103, the negligible <b>interseed</b> effect and the reduced artifacts in postimplant medical imaging, this experimental plastic seed would be a good source for breast brachytherapy. This feasibility study was carried out in collaboration with IBt and will be continued with a study of its visibility in different tissues...|$|R
40|$|Grazing bromegrass {{throughout}} the summer provides weight gains of up to two pounds a day during early and late summer. However, during July and August bromegrass growth and quality is low and weight gains of cattle grazing bromegrass are reduced. Grazing combinations of warm and cool season forages allows for optimizing forage quality by rotating to warm season grasses during July and August. Another alternative may be to <b>interseed</b> red clover in bromegrass to optimize forage quality. Inter-seeding red clover would provide a higher quality forage when bromegrass growth and quality is low and, in addition, provide a source of nitrogen for the bromegrass. thus reducing nitrogen fertilization costs. Grazing these forages during the summer when quality is high, and following a winter and spring period of limited animal growth. should produce excellent animal weight gains while reducing cost of gain. Objectives of the research were to evaluate the influence of different forage combinations on summer and fall grazing gains and to evaluate the effect {{of each of these}} combinations on the economics of the entire growing/finishing system...|$|R
40|$|Guretzky {{specializes in}} {{research}} on forage and bioenergy crop management that will assist agricultural producers and landowners in meeting their goals. The first area of research involves Drs. Jon Biermacher and Billy Cook {{for the evaluation of}} management practices of switchgrass in forage and bioenergy systems. Objectives include: 1.) assessing potential on-farm biomass yields and production economics of switchgrass; 2.) documenting effects of location, harvest system and nitrogen fertilizer rates on biomass yields, forage quality, stand persistence and nutrient removal rates; 3.) evaluating establishment and biomass production responses to phosphorus and potassium fertilization; 4.) determining how stocker cattle gains on switchgrass vary with stocking density; 5.) determining switchgrass persistence and end of season biomass yields following early season grazing; and 6.) determining economics of stocker cattle ownership on switchgrass. The second area of collaborative research involves Drs. Twain Butler, Ryan Reuter and Jon Biermacher and focuses on evaluation of legume species in pastures. Research objectives include: 1.) evaluating spring forage availability of winter annual legume species; and 2.) documenting net returns to land, labor and management from stocker cattle grazing N-fertilized and legume-interseeded pastures. Results have been promising. From 2006 to 2008, hairy vetch and Austrian winter pea produced dry matter yields ranging from 2, 204 to 6, 720 lb/acre across six environments. In 2008, a grazing experiment was established to compare bermudagrass fertilized with urea at 112 kg N/ ha; bermudagrass <b>interseeded</b> with a grazingtype alfalfa; and bermudagrass <b>interseeded</b> with a mixture of winter annual legumes (hairy vetch, crimson clover and arrowleaf clover). Net returns were $ 292, $ 109 and $ 227 /ha for N-fertilized, alfalfa and annual legume systems, respectively. Net returns between the N-fertilized and the annual legume system were sensitive to price of N, gain/ha, value of gain and grazing days. The third area of research evaluates the use of fire to improve rangeland for beef cattle and wildlife. In collaboration with Ken Gee and others, research at the Oswalt Road Ranch will examine how controlled burning affects stocker cattle production, herbaceous and woody species composition and biomass, and land management economics. Three experimental units will be controlled burned and grazed, and three will receive grazing only. Annual changes in herbage mass and plant communities will be documented beginning in 2009 and prescribed burning and grazing will continue until 2020...|$|R
