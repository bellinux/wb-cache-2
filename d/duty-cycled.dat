It {{is a new}} {{challenge}} to provide priority-based delivery in low <b>duty-cycled</b> sensor networks where there are not always-awake com-munication paths and the wireless links are very time-varying and un-reliable. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Routing Algorithm for priority Guarantee(called DRAG) in low <b>duty-cycled</b> sensor networks. Both schemes of dynamic forwarding decision making and priority-based schedule are used in DRAG to achieve priority guarantee in low <b>duty-cycled</b> sensor networks.

40|$|Geographic routing is {{a useful}} and {{scalable}} point-to-point communication primitive for wireless sensor networks. However, previous work on geographic routing makes the unrealistic assumption that all the nodes in the network are awake during routing. This overlooks the common deployment scenario where sensor nodes are <b>duty-cycled</b> to save energy. In this paper we investigate several important aspects of geographic routing over <b>duty-cycled</b> nodes. First, we extend existing geographic routing algorithms to handle the highly dynamic networks resulting from duty-cycling. Second, we provide the first formal analysis {{of the performance of}} geographic routing on <b>duty-cycled</b> nodes. Third, we use this analysis to develop an efficient decentralized sleep scheduling algorithm for reducing the number of awake nodes while maintaining both network coverage and a (tunable) target routing latency. Finally, we evaluate via simulation the performance of our approach versus running existing geographic routing algorithms on sensors <b>duty-cycled</b> according to previous sleep scheduling algorithms. Our results show, perhaps surprisingly, that a network of <b>duty-cycled</b> nodes can have slightly better routing performance than a static network that uses comparable energy. Our results further show that, compared to previous algorithms, our sleep scheduling algorithm significantly improves routing latency and network lifetime...|$|E

Moreover, for connected K-neighborhood (CKN) sleep scheduling-based <b>duty-cycled</b> IWSNs in which the network lifetime of IWSNs can be prolonged, the two-phase geographic greedy forwarding (TPGF) geographic routing algorithm has attracted attention due to its unique transmission features: multi path, shortest path, and hole bypassing.

While there exists a plethora of sensor MAC protocols, these protocols do not individually vary the <b>duty-cycle</b> of each sensor according to local connectivity status, to maximize energy savings. In this paper, we propose A 2 -MAC- an Adaptive, Anycast MAC protocol for low-powered wireless sensor networks. It utilizes: (i) a random wakeup schedule, such that each node can independently and randomly wakeup in each cycle without coordination and time synchronization; (ii) adaptive <b>duty-cycles</b> based on network topology; and (iii) adaptive anycast forwarders selection, which allows each node to transmit to any member in its forwarding set. There are two key adaptive mechanisms in A 2 -MAC: (i) each node varies its <b>duty-cycle</b> and set of forwarding nodes such that energy consumption can be locally minimized for a given local delay performance objective; (ii) nodes cooperatively reduce the <b>duty-cycles</b> required of their forwarding nodes, depending on local network connectivity.
