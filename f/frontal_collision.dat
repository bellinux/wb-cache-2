Without seat belts, passengers in a <b>frontal</b> <b>collision</b> could be hurled against {{the interior of}} the automobile or through the windshield. The vehicle body itself was rigid, and impact forces were transmitted directly to the vehicle occupants. As late as the 1950s, car manufacturers were on public record as saying that vehicle accidents simply could not be made survivable because the forces in a crash were too great.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{implementation of}} front airbags {{did little to}} protect against side collisions, which can be more dangerous than <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions</b> because the protective crumple zone {{in front of the}} passenger compartment is completely bypassed. Side airbags and protective airbag curtains are increasingly being required in modern vehicles to protect against this very common category of collisions.|$|R
50|$|It is {{recommended}} that children sit rear-facing {{for as long as}} possible. In Scandinavian countries, for example, children sit rear-facing until around 4 years old.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{shoulder}} range-of-motion and stiffness between volunteers and 50 th percentile dummies in static loading conditions simulating <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions.</b> Five volunteers a Hybrid III and a THOR Alpha were positioned in a test rig where both arms were statically loaded in the forward-upward direction at 90 °, 135 ° and 170 ° angles while the sternum was supported. The distances between right shoulders and sternums were estimated by means of photo analysis. The photo analysis showed that the volunteers’ range-of-motion was at least three times larger for the maximum load (200 N/arm) than those of the Hybrid III and the THOR Alpha. The results indicate that the biofidelity of the dummies used today in full-frontal, oblique and offset <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions</b> may be improved by redesigned shoulder complexes. The dummies would then better predict the human kinematics and the loading of the chest by various restraint systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{aggressivity}} {{of trucks}} to other road users in daily traffic is widely known. The incompatibility is the origin mostly of serious and fatal injuries. Much harm can be anticipated by preventing for underride. Most serious and fatal injuries is inflicted to occupants of passenger cars in <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions</b> with trucks. An {{underrun protection device}} helps to address the energy absorbing structure of the passenger car and thus reduces excessive deformation of the occupant compartment. Research on front underrun protection (FUP) for trucks by means of full scale testing, and especially on energy absorbing systems, is extensive and time consuming. Therefore simulation tools are applied in the early stage of the design process {{in order to obtain}} the basic parameters for later testing. In this presentation it is shown how MADYMO was used with combined multibody/finite element models of a truck with different types of FUP and a car in order to evaluate different FUP systems in car-to-truck <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{telescopic}} steering column designed to {{collapse in the}} event of a <b>frontal</b> <b>collision</b> (rather than penetrate the driver's chest) had been mainstream in competitor models from Opel and Volkswagen for some time, and with the TC Ford now also incorporated this safety feature on their new mid-size range for Germany and mainland Europe.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were many}} traffic {{accidents}} {{right after the}} 730. When turning right/left on a crossing, drivers often approached to {{the right-hand side of}} the road, although they had to approach to the left, resulting in one bus overturning. This led to many collisions on a crossing. Larger accidents included a <b>frontal</b> <b>collision</b> of two buses.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{generally}} accepted that car mass {{is an important}} factor in two vehicle collisions, with the occupants of the lighter vehicle experiencing more frequent and more severe injuries. The apparent dominance of mass in relative injury risk has been shown in the numerous statistical studies of real life <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions</b> between dissimilar cars. These studies have shown that Relative Injury Risk is proportional to Mr n; the exponent n increases from n= 1 to n= 2. 8 / 3. 7 as injury severity increases from minor (AIS 1) injuries to fatalities. Extensive research has been carried out into the compatibility of dissimilar cars in <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions</b> (1 - 7), and into the possible methods of reducing the size and mass effect. Wood & Simms (8) proposed a theoretical model for the apparent mass effect for <b>frontal</b> <b>collisions</b> between dissimilar cars. The central tenet of this theory is that the apportionment of collision energy between the colliding pair is a function of the structural collapse forces at maximum dynamic crush. (Up to the instant of maximum dynamic crush, the interface forces between the two vehicles are a combination of structural collapse and inertial forces, with the consequence that the structural force balance only becomes valid at maximum dynamic crush, when the vehicles have no relative velocity, i. e. the inertial forces at the interface are zero.) This theory, which was used in combination with a generalized characterization of the energy absorption characteristics of the car population with Monte Carlo simulation, predicted Relative Injury Risk versus Mass Ratio characteristics which were similar to the real life data over the collision speed range, up to EES values of 25 m/s...|$|R

In one fatality, the impact to the chest was the result of an exploding whipping cream canister.|$|R
5000|$|Bumper height {{from the}} roadway surface is {{important}} in engaging other protective systems. Airbag deployment sensors typically do not trigger until contact with an obstruction, {{and it is important}} that front bumpers be the first parts of a vehicle to make contact {{in the event of a}} <b>frontal</b> <b>collision,</b> to leave sufficient time to inflate the protective cushions.|$|E
50|$|An anti-submarine seat {{is a kind}} of {{seat that}} {{incorporates}} specially shaped panels in the forward edge of the seat cushion, reducing the tendency for the occupant to slide beneath the seatbelt in a severe <b>frontal</b> <b>collision.</b> Anti-submarine seating is a safety feature that may be more important for the front seats than the rear seats.|$|E
50|$|Fuel tank mounted airbags can aid {{in saving}} many lives. It {{has been proven}} with crash test dummies {{that this type of}} airbag {{technology}} is very beneficial during a <b>frontal</b> <b>collision.</b> This is important because statistically, 62% of motorcycle accidents in the U.S. are frontal collisions. Additional tests were performed to show that when a motorcycle rider impacts a car during a <b>frontal</b> <b>collision,</b> the fuel tank mounted airbag prevents the person from traveling into the vehicle. This significantly reduced the head trauma by 83% that otherwise would have occurred according to the data from the crash test dummy. A rider would have lived with an airbag, whereas the fatality rate would be higher without the airbag. It has also been pointed out that this can only work if the accident is at low speed and follows the same dynamics as a car accident.|$|E

50|$|Also, some {{specialized}} vehicles (such as the AM General HMMWV and {{the related}} Hummer H1) are designed with no frontal overhang, allowing it to possess incredible abilities such as climbing vertical walls.
