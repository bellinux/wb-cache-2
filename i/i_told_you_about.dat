60|$|MRS. MEGAN. [With faint eagerness.] Yes, sir, an' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> me vi'lets--it was a luvly spring-day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Flo Graves--the girl <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about,</b> who {{was engaged}} to that dreadful Mr. Vincent," [...] said Susan. [...] "Is Mr. Hutchinson married?" [...] she asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll think--" [...] Nelly's {{pale face}} flushed. [...] "You'll think <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> myself just--just because I wanted to...." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the boy 1/ {{who is in}} my class, 2/ and who is {{very good}} in mathematics. 3/ ...|$|R
60|$|Thus it {{was that}} Queen Guinevere went a-maying, and so have <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> it so that you might know how it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, he's the tin man <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about.</b> His name is Nick Chopper, {{and he has}} {{a lovely}} heart given him by the {{wonderful}} Wizard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Kennedy, {{this is my}} granddaughter, Frances Newbury. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> her and her ambitions last night. You see, Frances, we {{have talked}} you over." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thirlwell started. [...] "It is possible! I'm glad <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> {{my watch}} at the shack. I didn't at first; the things I {{suspected}} looked ridiculous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish <b>I</b> hadna <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it!" [...] Indeed, he had {{endeavored}} {{not to do}} so, but {{pride in}} his achievement had eventually conquered prudence.|$|R
6000|$|Agatha laughed. [...] "Come," [...] {{she said}} good-humoredly, [...] "don't {{be an old}} ass, Jane. Wash your face before anyone sees it, and {{remember}} what <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Sir Charles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are not implying, Robert, that I ever--. If I {{ever did}} <b>I</b> always <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it afterwards, didn't I? And I {{certainly}} never did it until I was {{sure you were}} comfortable.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then {{we can go}} in to the others. Remember what <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> omitting {{the first}} seven pages. The society won't stand {{introductory}} remarks in a thesis." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Chalmers' friend, Jesson, {{the secret}} service man who came over to us?" [...] he said. [...] "Chalmers has just sent me round this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As for me, I {{think of}} nothing but {{politics}} now. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> my racing experiences. Just at present shooting is up. Before Christmas I shall go into Chiltern's country for a little hunting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It took {{me back to}} the old scenes," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Bowman, dreamily. [...] "I {{have never}} kept anything back from <b>you,</b> Nathaniel. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> the first man I ever thought anything of--Charlie Tucker?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that. If I am so, it doesn't bring me happiness. ... Do <b>you</b> {{remember}} what <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> once, <b>about</b> my being a preacher--disgrace, ruin, and all that--and my rainbow-chasing dream out here after a--a lost girl?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} I {{told you}} that Ellen threw them both into the street? A man who was wheeling a fruit barrow picked up one. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Hamel, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Aunt Emmeline. She {{will not}} allow it. I ought not to have let you speak to me like this, while I am staying here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was real, then, an' no dream. I mind it all, now--the {{shriek of}} the whistle, the crash, and {{the screams of}} the dying. Have <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it, Donald?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Silly boy!' said Erskine. 'Go home: it {{is after}} two, and don't think about Willie Hughes any more. I am sorry <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> it, and very sorry indeed that I should have converted {{you to a}} thing in which I don't believe.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so--at any rate, for a time. I do {{not know}} where the uncle <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> is, at present. At any rate, while this war is going on he can do very little trade, and can manage very well without me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, haven't <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Chopfyt?" [...] exclaimed Ku-Klip. [...] "Of course not! And he's quite a curiosity, too. You'll be {{interested}} in hearing about Chopfyt. This is how he happened: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a very}} {{harmless}} kind of boyishness at all events," [...] replied Wallace. [...] "It is {{not like}} some other kinds of boyishness, such as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the other day." ...|$|E

60|$|Cadmus, quite out of breath, stood leaning {{upon his}} sword, and {{wondering}} what was to happen next. He had waited but a few moments, {{when he began to}} see a sight, which was as great a marvel as the most marvellous thing <b>I</b> ever <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "The Deer family," [...] began Old Mother Nature, [...] "is {{divided into}} two branches--the round-horned and the flat-horned. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the round-horned Deer with the {{exception}} of the largest and noblest, Bugler the Elk.

6000|$|... "I {{answered}} you that," [...] she whispered, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> loved you." [...] She leaned away, {{and looked}} thoughtfully at him. [...] "If <b>I</b> had not <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> myself, would <b>you</b> have--would you--" ...|$|R
60|$|BARTHWICK. [With excited emphasis.]. It's no {{laughing}} matter, Roper. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> {{that business}} of Jack's too--don't {{you see the}} brute took both the things--took that infernal purse. It'll get into the papers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember what <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> horses," [...] he reiterated to Saxon; and, {{assisted}} by his hostess, {{he gave a}} very creditable disquisition on horseflesh and its management from a business point of view.|$|E

6000|$|... "All stopped, of course. A {{few nights}} ago, two stags came {{right up to}} the house and quite a troop of the really wild ponies from over Hawkbridge way. We've never had such a spell of cold in my memory. It {{reminded}} one of the snowstorm in 'Lorna Doone.'--But after all, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> Woolhanger last night. I want your news." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But so far, father, it has {{not been}} a regimental affair. I simply sent my own boy with a note to Miss Conyers, just to say where we were; but, as it may be an affair in which some of the troop may have to act, <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it, so that you can make what {{arrangements}} you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{remember}} if <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> last night <b>about</b> the party. We are giving a little supper-dance {{to the company}} of Otie's play after the performance this evening. Of course you will come?" ...|$|R
