The Passport retails for $29 (including $10 of airtime). Incoming calls to the U.S. number cost $0.19 per minute, while {{incoming}} calls to the U.K. number are free regardless of where the call originated. With the Passport SIM, Telestial also offers an optional 800 number that {{can be linked to}} the SIM, so contacts in the U.S. can avoid long distance or international charges (though calls will cost you $0.35 per minute). The Passport SIM also offers prepaid data plans that give travelers total control of expenses for mobile data and online activity from a wireless device.|$|E
5000|$|Nouns decline for 5 cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, {{instrumental}}; 3 genders: masculine, feminine, neuter; 2 numbers: singular, and plural; and are strong, or weak. The instrumental is vestigial {{and only}} {{used with the}} masculine and neuter singular and often replaced by the dative. Only pronouns and strong adjectives retain separate instrumental forms. There is also sparse early Northumbrian evidence of a sixth case; the locative. Adjectives agree with nouns in case, gender, number, and strong, or weak forms. Pronouns and sometimes participles agree in case, gender, and number. First and second person personal-pronouns occasionally distinguish <b>dual-number</b> forms. The definite article [...] and its inflections serve as a definite article ("the"), a demonstrative adjective ("that"), and demonstrative pronoun. Other demonstratives are [...] ("this"), and [...] ("yon"). These words inflect for gender, number and case. Adjectives have both strong and weak sets of endings, weak ones being used when a definite or possessive determiner is also present.|$|E

It is shown that finite screw motions in Minkowski 3 -space {{can be expressed}} by <b>dual-number</b> (3 3 ×) matrices in dual Lorentzian space. Moreover, by means of Hamilton operators, screw motion is obtained in 3 -dimensional Minkowski space 31 R...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This work is an {{introduction}} to a new method for modeling elastically coupled rigid bodies, with application to modeling and computer simulation of spatial, flexural mechanisms. Geometric algebra is used in an essential way to provide a coordinate-free approach to Euclidean geometry and rigid body mechanics that fully integrates rotational and translational dynamics. Finite, elastic displacements of rigid bodies are associated naturally with screw displacements that are simply represented as bivectors in geometric algebra. The potential energy of an arbitrary elastic coupling in internal equilibrium has been investigated previously using <b>dual-number,</b> matrix methods. Geometric algebra provides an invariant formulation that is less ambiguous, easier to interpret geometrically, and manifestly more efficient in symbolic computation. 1...|$|E
40|$|Existing 3 D indoor {{mapping of}} RGB-D data are {{prominently}} point-based and feature-based methods. In most cases {{iterative closest point}} (ICP) and its variants are generally used for pairwise registration process. Considering that the ICP algorithm requires an relatively accurate initial transformation and high overlap a weighted closed-form solution for RGB-D data registration is proposed. In this solution, we weighted and normalized the 3 D points based on the theoretical random errors and the <b>dual-number</b> quaternions are used to represent the 3 D rigid body motion. Basically, <b>dual-number</b> quaternions provide a closed-form solution by minimizing a cost function. The most important advantage of the closed-form solution is that it provides the optimal transformation in one-step, it {{does not need to}} calculate good initial estimates and expressively decreases the demand for computer resources in contrast to the iterative method. Basically, first our method exploits RGB information. We employed a scale invariant feature transformation (SIFT) for extracting, detecting, and matching features. It is able to detect and describe local features that are invariant to scaling and rotation. To detect and filter outliers, we used random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, jointly with an statistical dispersion called interquartile range (IQR). After, a new RGB-D loop-closure solution is implemented based on the volumetric information between pair of point clouds and the dispersion of the random errors. The loop-closure consists to recognize when the sensor revisits some region. Finally, a globally consistent map is created to minimize the registration errors via a graph-based optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with a Kinect dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method can properly map the indoor environment with an absolute accuracy around 1. 5 % of the travel of a trajectory...|$|E

5000|$|Route 24 used {{to extend}} much further east. The section of Interstate 680 between the current {{terminus}} of SR 24 and State Route 242 was dual-signed I-680 and SR 24 until ca. 1987; State Route 242 which runs primarily in Concord was signed as Route 24 until the same time. Older maps show routes for 24 which continue along State Route 4 {{from the current}} intersection of 242 to the Antioch Bridge, continuing along the river road to Sacramento, currently State Route 160, then continuing north to Woodland, Marysville, Oroville, along the North Fork of the Feather River to a junction with State Route 89, where it continued <b>dual-numbered</b> with 89 through Quincy. Highway 24 split from 89 near Graeagle, and continued east through Portola east until its terminus at U.S. Route 395. Parts of the same route were also sometimes designated as State Route 84. [...] At least one published map from the 1960s incorrectly showed Route 24 extending eastward from Interstate 680 in Walnut Creek to Route 4 in Pittsburg that followed the Ygnacio Valley Road-Kirker Pass Road-Railroad Avenue corridor, presumably as a future extension that never materialized.|$|R

Volume 3, whose first 25 issues were written by Kurt Busiek and then by Busiek and Roger Stern, ran 89 issues (Feb. 1998 - Dec. 2004). Later writers included Joe Quesada, Frank Tieri, Mike Grell, and John Jackson Miller. Issue #41 (June 2001) was additionally numbered #386, reflecting the start of dual numbering starting from the premiere issue of volume one in 1968. The final issue was <b>dual-numbered</b> as #434. The next Iron Man series, The Invincible Iron Man vol. 4, debuted in early 2005 with the Warren Ellis-written storyline [...] "Extremis", with artist Adi Granov. It ran 35 issues (Jan. 2005 - Jan. 2009), with the cover logo simply Iron Man beginning with issue #13, and Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., beginning issue #15. On the final three issues, the cover logo was overwritten by [...] "War Machine, Weapon of S.H.I.E.L.D.", which led to the launch of a War Machine ongoing series.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} eight methods of representing a general spatial rigid-body screw displacement. A distinction is made between point transformations and line transformations. The following three representations involving point transformations are considered: the real 4 x 4 matrix; the complex 4 x 4 matrix; and the real 6 x 6 matrix. These utilise homogeneous coordinates. The remaining five representations considered here are concerned with line transformations and are: the dual orthogonal 3 x 3 matrix; the dual special unitary 2 x 2 matrix; the dual Pauli spin matrices; the dual unit quaternion; and the dual special unitary 3 x 3 matrix. These make use of <b>dual-number</b> techniques. The most commonly used of these representations is the 4 x 4 real matrix and the conclusion reached {{is that this is}} certainly the best of the point transformations. The dual unit quaternion is similarly found to be the best of the line transformations. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple second-order, curvature based mobility analysis of planar curves in contact. The underlying theory deals with penetration and separation of curves with multiple contacts, based on relative configuration of osculating circles at points of contact for a second-order rotation about each {{point of the}} plane. Geometric and analytical treatment of mobility analysis is presented for generic as well as special contact geometries. For objects with a single contact, partitioning of the plane into four types of mobility regions has been shown. Using point based composition operations based on <b>dual-number</b> matrices, analysis has been extended to computationally handle multiple contacts scenario. A novel color coded directed line has been proposed to capture the contact scenario. Multiple contacts mobility is obtained through intersection of the mobility half-spaces. It is derived that mobility region comprises a pair of unbounded or a single bounded convex polygon. The theory {{has been used for}} analysis and synthesis of form closure configurations, revolute and prismatic kinematic pairs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades the {{theoretical}} development of more and more refined direct methods, together with {{a new generation of}} CPUs, led to a significant improvement of numerical approaches for solving optimal-control problems. One of the most promising class of methods is based on Pseudospectral Optimal Control. These methods not only provide an efficient algorithm to solve optimal-control problems, but also define a theoretical framework for linking the discrete numerical solution to the analytical one in virtue of the covector-mapping theorem. However, sveral aspects in their implementation can be refined. In this framework SPARTAN, the first European tool based on flipped Radau pseudospectral methods, has been developed. The tool, and the method behind it include two novel aspects. First, the discretized problem is automatically scaled with a novel technique, called Projected Rows Jacobian Normalization. This avoids ill-conditioned problems, which could lead to non-reliable solutions. Second, the structure of the Jacobian matrix is exploited, and the <b>dual-number</b> theory is used for its computation. This yields faster and more accurate solutions, since the associated Jacobian matrix computed in this way is exact. Two concrete examples show the validity of the proposed approach, {{and the quality of the}} results obtained with SPARTAN...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{kinematic}} synthesis of parallel manipulators at large, special attention being given to three versions of a novel class of mainpulators, named double-triangular. These are conceived in planar, spherical and spatial double-triangular varieties. The treatment of planar and spherical manipulators needs only planar and spherical trigonometry, a fact that inductively leads to the successful treatment of spatial varieties with methods of spatial trigonometry, wherein the relationships are cast in the form of <b>dual-number</b> algebraic expressions. Using the foregoing tools, the direct kinematics of the three types of double-triangular manipulators is formulated and resolved. Moreover, a general three-group classification, to deal with singularities encountered in parallel manipulators, is proposed. The classification scheme relies on the properties of Jacobian matrices of parallel manipulators. It is shown that all singularities, within the workspaces of the manipulators of interest, are readily identified if their Jacobian matrices are formulated in an invariant form. Finally, the optimal design of the manipulators is studied. These designs minimize the roundoff-error amplification effects due to the numerical inversion of the underlying Jacobian matrices. Such designs are called isotropic. Based on this concept the multi-dimensional isotropic design continua of several manipulators are derived...|$|E
