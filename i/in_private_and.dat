5|$|Although the pharaoh {{delegated}} his authority, {{the performance}} of temple rituals was still an official duty, restricted to high-ranking priests. The participation of the general populace in most ceremonies was prohibited. Much of the lay religious activity in Egypt instead took place <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>and</b> community shrines, separate from the official temples. As the primary link between the human and divine realms, temples attracted considerable veneration from ordinary Egyptians.|$|E

5|$|As {{requested}} by Walpole, George revived the Order of the Bath in 1725, which enabled Walpole to reward or gain political supporters by offering them the honour. Walpole became extremely powerful and was largely able to appoint ministers {{of his own}} choosing. Unlike his predecessor, Queen Anne, George rarely attended meetings of the cabinet; most of his communications were <b>in</b> <b>private,</b> <b>and</b> he only exercised substantial influence with respect to British foreign policy. With the aid of Lord Townshend, he arranged for the ratification by Great Britain, France and Prussia of the Treaty of Hanover, {{which was designed to}} counterbalance the Austro-Spanish Treaty of Vienna and protect British trade.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>and</b> public performances, Mendelssohn {{was also}} renowned for his improvisations. On one {{occasion}} in London, {{when asked by}} the soprano Maria Malibran after a recital to extemporise, he created a piece which included the melodies of all the songs she had sung. The music publisher Victor Novello who was present remarked 'He has done some things that seem to me impossible, even after I have heard them done.' At another recital in 1837, where Mendelssohn played the piano for a singer, Robert Schumann ignored the soprano and wrote 'Mendelssohn accompanied like a God'.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} side of the Inner Ward is another barbican, {{enclosing}} the castle garden. This was overlooked by the royal apartments, and changed in style over the years: in the early 14th century there was a lawn, in the late 14th century vines, in the 16th century crab-apple trees and a lawn and in the 17th century formal ornamental flowers. A postern gate originally led down to the river where a small dock was built, allowing key visitors to enter the castle <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>and</b> for the fortress to be resupplied by boat, although this gate is now concealed by the later bridges built on the site.|$|E

There, Erkko met the Swedish foreign minister Rickard Sandler <b>in</b> <b>private,</b> <b>and</b> Sandler assured him that he would persuade the Swedish government to assist Finland during a possible war. During the actual war, however, Sandler failed in this task and resigned. Finland was totally isolated by a German and Soviet blockade, and attempted in October to obtain arms and ammunition in absolute secrecy by enlisting the German arms dealer Josef Veltjens.|$|E
5|$|The {{aqueduct}} {{was built}} of local limestone. Stones were attached {{with the use}} of pozzolana. It was this successful feature that gave most praise to Bontadini.

5|$|Theophilos, in turn, was {{hesitant}} {{to believe the}} accusations, and was eventually convinced by the protovestiarios (chamberlain) Leo Chamodrakon and the synkellos John the Grammarian of his general's innocence.

John was indeed able to see Manuel <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>and</b> offered him the Emperor's pardon, which Manuel seemed to accept, although for the time being, Manuel remained publicly loyal to his Abbasid allegiance.|$|E

During the Great Purge, he approved 372 documented execution lists, more than any other Soviet official, including Stalin. Molotov was one of few with whom Stalin openly discussed the purges. Although Molotov and Stalin signed a public decree in 1938 that disassociated them from the ongoing Great Purge, <b>in</b> <b>private,</b> <b>and</b> even after Stalin's death, Molotov supported the Great Purge and the executions carried out by his government.|$|E

Pleased by this scheme, Mac Da Thó takes each {{delegation}} aside <b>in</b> <b>private,</b> <b>and</b> intimates to both that he had awarded the hound to them after much deliberation.

5|$|Adolf Hitler—accompanied by Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, {{his former}} naval {{adjutant}} Commander Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, and his Luftwaffe adjutant Oberst Nicolaus von Below, among others—visited Bismarck on 5 May 1941. Missing was Grand Admiral Erich Raeder. Hitler was {{taken on a}} tour of the ship by Admiral Lütjens and inspected the various battle stations. Hitler and Lütjens also met <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>and</b> discussed the risks of a mission in the North Atlantic. After this meeting, Hitler and the officers of Bismarck had lunch in the officers' mess, where Hitler spoke about America's unwillingness to enter the war. Lindemann openly disagreed with Hitler, expressing his opinion that the possibility of the United States entering the war could not be ruled out.|$|E

5|$|Conwy Castle hugs a rocky coastal {{ridge of}} grey {{sandstone}} and limestone, {{and much of}} the stone from the castle is largely taken from the ridge itself, probably when the site was first cleared. The castle has a rectangular plan and is divided into an inner and outer ward, with four large towers on each side. The main entrance to the castle is through the western barbican, an exterior defence in front of the main gate. The barbican features the earliest surviving stone machicolations in Britain. A postern gate originally led down to the river where a small dock was built, allowing key visitors to enter the castle <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>and</b> for the fortress to be resupplied by boat. Conwy's outer ward was originally crowded with administrative and service buildings. The inner ward was separated from the outer by a wall, a drawbridge and a gate, protected by a ditch cut into the rock. Inside, it contained the chambers for the royal household, their immediate staff and service facilities. On {{the east side of the}} inner ward is another barbican, enclosing the castle garden.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{accounts}} suggest narcissi {{have been}} cultivated {{from the earliest}} times, but became increasingly popular in Europe after the 16th century and by the late 19th century were an important commercial crop centred primarily on the Netherlands. Today narcissi are popular as cut flowers and as ornamental plants <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>and</b> public gardens. The long history of breeding has resulted in thousands of different cultivars. For horticultural purposes, narcissi are classified into divisions, covering {{a wide range of}} shapes and colours. Like other members of their family, narcissi produce a number of different alkaloids, which provide some protection for the plant, but may be poisonous if accidentally ingested. This property has been exploited for medicinal use in traditional healing and has resulted in the production of galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Long celebrated in art and literature, narcissi are associated with a number of themes in different cultures, ranging from death to good fortune, and as symbols of spring. The daffodil is the national flower of Wales and the symbol of cancer charities in many countries. The appearance of the wild flowers in spring is associated with festivals in many places.|$|E
5|$|In June 1560, Michel de l'Hôpital was {{appointed}} Chancellor of France. He sought {{the support of}} France's constitutional bodies and worked closely with Catherine to defend {{the law in the}} face of the growing anarchy. Neither saw the need to punish Protestants who worshipped <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>and</b> did not take up arms. On 20 August 1560, Catherine and the chancellor advocated this policy to an assembly of notables at Fontainebleau. Historians regard the occasion as an early example of Catherine's statesmanship. Meanwhile, Condé raised an army and in autumn 1560 began attacking towns in the south. Catherine ordered him to court and had him imprisoned as soon as he arrived. He was tried in November, found guilty of offences against the crown, and sentenced to death. His life was saved by the illness and death of the king, as a result of an infection or an abscess in his ear.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{government}} columbaria and 57 private ones. The government-operated columbaria are at Mandai, Yishun and Choa Chu Kang. (A fourth government columbarium at Mount Vernon {{is due to}} close at an unspecified date due to redevelopment of its surrounding area into a public housing estate.) Private columbaria are operated by the Kong Meng San Phor Kark See Monastery, the Roman Catholic Church of Saint Mary of the Angels in Bukit Batok, and the Singapore Soka Association, among others. As with crematoria, {{there is a significant}} price difference between niches <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>and</b> government columbaria. A standard niche in any government columbarium costs less than $900, but one at the Kong Meng San monastery costs more than $15,000. The government columbaria allocate niches sequentially, and charge an extra $250 for any location change request; for an extra price, the private columbaria allow families to choose niche locations subject to availability, and even to pre-book niches before death.|$|E
5|$|With Graham {{gone and}} the quarterback {{situation}} in flux, the Browns ended 1956 with a 5–7 record, Paul Brown's first losing season as a professional coach. In the next year's draft, the team selected Jim Brown out of Syracuse University. As television began to help football leapfrog baseball as America's most popular sport, Jim Brown became a larger-than-life personality. He was handsome and charismatic <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>and</b> dominant on the field. Paul Brown, however, was critical of some aspects of Jim Brown's game, including his disinclination to block. In Jim Brown's first season, the team reached the championship game, again against the Lions, but lost 59–14. The Browns did not contend for the championship in the following two years, when a Baltimore Colts team coached by Brown's former protege Weeb Ewbank won a pair of titles.|$|E
5|$|For aristocrats {{to succeed}} <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>and</b> public life during the Heian period, it was {{essential}} to be fluent in the composition and appreciation of waka, as well as having thorough knowledge of and ability in music, and calligraphy. Poetry was used in witty conversations, in notes of invitation, thanks or condolence, and for correspondence between friends and lovers. Some of the finest poetry of the Heian period came from the middle-class court society such as ladies in waiting or middle-rank officials. Uta-awase poetry contests, in which poets composed poetry on a given theme to be judged by an individual, were held from 885 onwards, and became a regular activity for Heian courtiers from the 10th century onward. Contest judgments led to works about waka theory and critical studies. Poems from the contents were added to imperial anthologies. Critical theories, and the poems in the anthologies (particularly the Kokinshū), {{became the basis for}} judgments in the contests. Utaawase continued to be held through the late-11th century, as social rather than literary events. Held in opulence in a spirit of friendly rivalry, they included chanters, scribes, consultants, musicians, and an audience. During the Heian period, waka were often collected in large anthologies, such as the Man'yōshū or Kokinshū, or smaller private collections of the works of a single poet. Waka also featured highly in all kinds of literary prose works including monogatari, diaries and historical works. The Tale of Genji alone contains 800 waka.|$|E
