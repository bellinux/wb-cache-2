50|$|There {{are certain}} {{ingredients}} {{that go with}} certain countries as well. In Ghana, {{the most commonly used}} ingredients are hot pepper, ginger, and maize. Ghanaians use hot pepper because they believe the hot peppers will cool the body and cleanse/purify it. (Salm, 106-108). In Senegal, the main ingredients are among many others gumbo, hot pepper, rice, millet, peanut, ginger, tamarind leaves, and baobab fruit, and cooking oil (Ross, 75). Those are the few that have a slight difference of what they commonly use for their dishes. For an overall view of West Africa, according to Fran Osseo-Asare, the common ingredients for the West African region are the leaves from a baobab tree, cereal grains: sorghum, millet, and fonio, Cola nuts, egusi seeds, <b>guinea</b> fowl, melegueta <b>pepper,</b> oil palm, okra, and rice.

Six out of 12 council wards in VLG were randomly selected for the survey through multi-stage random sampling. A total of 200 farmer respondents were sampled out of a taungya farmer population of 562 in the selected wards. All the 16 members {{of staff of the}} VLG forestry service were interviewed. The two categories of respondents were then interviewed using the same type of semi-structured questionnaire. This was to check and corroborate the responses of both groups of respondents. Data collected was subjected to descriptive statistics (like percentages) and inferential statistics [such as analysis of variances (ANOVA) ]. The mean yields of yam, cassava, sweet potatoes, rice, maize, groundnuts, soybeans, <b>guinea</b> corn, beans, <b>pepper</b> and melon on taungya plots ranged from 306. 67 kg/ha for melon to 1698. 33 kg/ha for cassava. The corresponding yields of melon and cassava on non-taungya plots were 250. 00 kg/ha and 1372. 67 kg/ha, respectively. Crop yields were significantly higher on most taungya plots except that of melon (p> 0. 05). The total forest area declined from 312. 9 ha in 1995 to 83. 5 ha in 2000. Reforestation with indigenous tree species, establishment of seed and clonal banks, adoption of socially and ecologically acceptable taungya practices, review of land tenure laws and sensitization of farmers on sustainable taungya practices are advocated...|$|R

50|$|To attract Muslim traders {{along the}} routes {{traveled}} in North Africa, the first factory trading post {{was built in}} 1445 {{on the island of}} Arguin, off the coast of Mauritania. Portuguese merchants accessed the interior via the Senegal and Gambia rivers, which bisected long-standing trans-Saharan routes. They brought in copperware, cloth, tools, wine, and horses, and later included arms and ammunition. In exchange, they received gold from the mines of Akan, <b>Guinea</b> <b>pepper</b> (a trade which lasted until Vasco da Gama reached India in 1498), and ivory. The expanding market opportunities in Europe and the Mediterranean resulted in increased trade across the Sahara. There was a very small market for African slaves as domestic workers in Europe, and as workers on the sugar plantations of the Mediterranean and later Madeira. The Portuguese found they could make considerable amounts of gold by transporting slaves from one trading post to another, along the Atlantic coast of Africa: Muslim merchants had a high demand for slaves, which were used as porters on the trans-Saharan routes, and for sale in the Islamic Empire.|$|E
50|$|Both {{flora and}} fauna are those {{characteristic}} of {{the greater part of}} tropical Africa. As far south as Benguela the coast region is rich in oil palms and mangroves. In {{the northern part of the}} province are dense forests. In the South towards the Kunene are regions of dense thorn scrub. Rubber vines and trees are abundant, but in some districts their number has been considerably reduced by the primitive methods adopted by native collectors of rubber. The species most common are various root rubbers, notably the Carpodinus chylorrhiza. This species and other varieties of carpodinus are very widely distributed. Landolphias are also found. The coffee, cotton and <b>Guinea</b> <b>pepper</b> plants are indigenous, and the tobacco plant flourishes in several districts. Among the trees are several which yield excellent timber, such as the tacula (Pterocarpus tinctorius), which grows to an immense size, its wood being blood-red in colour, and the Angola mahogany. The bark of the musuemba (Albizzia coriaria) is largely used in the tanning of leather. The mulundo bears a fruit about the size of a cricket ball covered with a hard green shell and containing scarlet pips like a pomegranate.|$|E
50|$|In 1554 Lok was {{captain of}} three ships, the Trinity of 140 tons, the Bartholomew of 90 tons, and the John Evangelist of 140 tons which set sail on a trading voyage to Guinea on 11 October. Although {{unfavourable}} winds {{kept them from}} leaving England's shores until 1 November, they were near Madeira by 17 November, and becalmed two days later at the Canary Islands under the Peak of Tenerife. They touched the coast of Africa at Cape Barbas, and after reaching {{the mouth of the}} Sestos River, traded down the coast, 'touching every place of consequence without any memorable incident occurring' until 13 February, when they turned back toward England. Although the voyage out had taken seven weeks, the return voyage took twenty. In all, twenty-four seamen were lost {{in the course of the}} voyage. The cargo brought back included more than 400 pounds' weight of gold, 36 butts of <b>Guinea</b> <b>pepper,</b> and 250 elephants’ tusks, as well as an elephant's skull of such size and weight that a man could scarcely lift it. Lok's ships also brought home five Africans from present-day Ghana to learn English and act as interpreters on future trading voyages to Guinea.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{highlights}} the practical {{application of a}} Piper-based botanical insecticide for controlling insect pests {{of the home and}} garden in urban areas in eastern Canada and northeastern North America. Biopesticides, including botanicals, can offer a safe and effective alternative to conventional insecticides for controlling major insect pests within an IPM program. Secondary compounds from the Piperaceae family, specifically the abundant isobutyl amides and lignans, have shown promise for insecticidal applications. A method for extraction and HPLC-MS analysis of Piper spp. was developed in order to allow quick and accurate measure of piperamide levels in P. nigrum, P. tuberculatum, West African <b>Guinea</b> <b>pepper,</b> P. guineense Schum and Thonn, and in less recognized species from Central America. Extraction of leaf and peppercorn material with 50 : 50 ethyl acetate and water provided a greater than 80 % recovery of spiked piperine. HPLC analysis using a binary gradient of acetonitrile and water provided a clean separation of the major amide peaks between 5 and 12 min. The use of APCI-MS improved the detection limit 10 fold below the 2 -ng limit of the HPLC-DAD method. Extracts from P. nigrum, P. guineense and P. tuberculatum were tested for efficacy against insects from five orders. Among the insect pests tested, the most sensitive species were, in order of increasing lethal concentration: Eastern tent caterpillar, Malacosoma americanum F. < European pine sawfly larvae, Neodiprion sertifer Geoffroy < spindle ermine moth larvae, Yponomeuta cagnagella Hubner < Viburnum leaf beetle larvae, Pyrrhalta viburni Paykull < stripped cucumber beetle adult, Acalymma vittatum Fabrcius < Colorado potato beetle adult, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) < Japanese beetle adult, Popillia japonica Newman < hairy chinch bug, Blissus leucopterus hirtus Montandon. Greenhouse trials revealed that the pepper formulations also had a repellent activity thus protecting plant leaves from: (1) herbivory by lily leaf beetles, Lilioceris lilii (Scopoli) adults and larvae, and striped cucumber beetle, Acalymma vittatum F. adults and (2) oviposition by European corn borer, Ostrina nubilalis (Hubner). When an insecticide resistant strain of potato beetle larvae was tested with the P. tuberculatum extract, there was less than a two fold tolerance ratio compared to the 22 -fold tolerance ratio to cypermethrin, a pyrethroid. An in vitro polysubstrate monoxygenase (PSMO) enzyme assay, using the substrate methoxyresorufin O-demethylation (MROD), determined that piperine, is responsible for inhibition of that specific enzyme. A subsequent toxicokinetic study determined that piperine is quickly eliminated from the exoskeleton (t 1 / 2 = 16. 5 h) and hemolymph (t 1 / 2 = 12 h) of the adult American cockroach Periplaneta americana L. after a topical application.
