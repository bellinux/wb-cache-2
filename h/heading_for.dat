The army of Lentulus was deployed to bar Spartacus' path, and the consuls hoped to trap the rebel slaves between them.

40|$|The {{method for}} defectoscopy of {{materials}} that uses separated ultrasonic <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> emitting and reception of signals i. e. ultrasonic transmission defectoscopy {{has not been}} much in use {{in science and engineering}} until now. This method consists of an ultrasonic <b>head</b> <b>for</b> emitting signal and only a single ultrasonic <b>head</b> <b>for</b> its reception. The method described in this paper is named quadraphonic transmission ultrasound defectoscopy (QTUD). It is an ultrasonic defectoscopy method for materials testing that uses a single ultrasonic <b>head</b> <b>for</b> emitting and four ultrasonic <b>heads</b> <b>for</b> receiving of ultrasonic signal. The advantage of this method is its suitability even with porous materials, all based on relatively low frequencies (about few tens of kHz). Therefore, electronic components are cheaper, so the wide application of this method, both in science and industry is possible...|$|R
