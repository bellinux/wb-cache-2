MOCAL flour is made as wheat flour substitution which is still imported so it can save state foreign exchange. With the existence of MOCAL production can increase the value of cassava and can decrease the using of wheat flour which is imported product. MOCAL flour has good prospect for development. It {{can be seen from}} the big amount supply of resource, therefore the possibility of dearth resources can be avoided. The existence of MOCAL flour as wheat flour alternative is very useful for national food manufacture industry.

We have solved structures of three ChiB complexes that reveal details of substrate binding, substrate-assisted catalysis, and product displacement. The structure of an inactive ChiB mutant (E 144 Q) complexed with a pentameric substrate (binding in subsites − 2 to + 3) shows closure of the “roof” of the active site tunnel. It also shows that the sugar in the − 1 position is distorted to a boat conformation, thus providing structural {{evidence in support of}} a previously proposed catalytic mechanism. The structures of the active enzyme complexed to allosamidin (an analogue of a proposed reaction intermediate) and of the active <b>enzyme</b> <b>soaked</b> with pentameric substrate show events after cleavage of the glycosidic bond.

The enzyme catalyzes the reversible cleavage of four diastereoisomers (fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate (FBP), psicose 1, 6 -bisphosphate, sorbose 1, 6 -bisphosphate, and tagatose 1, 6 -bisphosphate) to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and d-glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate with high catalytic efficiency. To investigate its enzymatic mechanism, high resolution crystal structures were determined of both native enzyme and native enzyme in complex with dihydroxyacetone-P. The electron density map revealed a (α/β) 8 fold in each dimeric subunit. Flash-cooled crystals of native <b>enzyme</b> <b>soaked</b> with dihydroxyacetone phosphate trapped a covalent intermediate with carbanionic character at Lys 205, different from the enamine mesomer bound in stereospecific class I FBP aldolase. Structural analysis indicates extensive active site conservation with respect to class I FBP aldolases, including conserved conformational responses to DHAP binding and conserved stereospecific proton transfer at the DHAP C 3 carbon mediated by a proximal water molecule. Exchange reactions with tritiated water and tritium-labeled DHAP at C 3 hydrogen were carried out in both solution and crystalline state to assess stereochemical control at C 3. The kinetic studies show labeling at both pro-R and pro-S C 3 positions of DHAP yet detritiation only at the C 3 pro-S-labeled position. Detritiation of the C 3 pro-R label was not detected and is consistent with preferential cis-trans isomerism about the C 2 –C 3 bond in the carbanion as the mechanism responsible for C 3 epimerization in tagatose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate aldolase...|$|R

40|$|N 2 O is {{generated}} by denitrifying bacteria {{as a product of}} NO reduction. In denitrification, N 2 O is metabolized further by the enzyme N 2 O reductase (N 2 OR), a multicopper protein which converts N 2 O into dinitrogen and water. The structure of N 2 OR remained unknown until the recent elucidation {{of the structure of the}} enzyme isolated from Pseudomonas nautica. In the present paper, we report the crystal structure of a blue form of the enzyme that was purified under aerobic conditions from Paracoccus denitrificans. N 2 OR is a head-to-tail homodimer stabilized by a multitude of interactions including two calcium sites located at the intermonomeric surface. Each monomer is composed of two domains: a C-terminal cupredoxin domain that carries the dinuclear electron entry site known as Cu(A), and an N-terminal seven-bladed beta-propeller domain which hosts the active-site centre Cu(Z). The electrons are transferred from Cu(A) to Cu(Z) across the subunit interface. Cu(Z) is a tetranuclear copper cluster in which the four copper ions (Cu 1 to Cu 4) are ligated by seven histidine imidazoles, a hydroxyl or water oxygen and a bridging inorganic sulphide. A bound chloride ion near the Cu(Z) active site shares one of the ligand imidazoles of Cu 1. This arrangement probably influences the redox potential of Cu 1 so that this copper is stabilized in the cupric state. The treatment of N 2 OR with H 2 O 2 or cyanide causes the disappearance of the optical band at 640 nm, attributed to the Cu(Z) centre. The crystal structure of the <b>enzyme</b> <b>soaked</b> with H 2 O 2 or cyanide suggests that an average of one copper of the Cu(Z) cluster has been lost. The lowest occupancy is observed for Cu 3 and Cu 4. A docking experiment suggests that N(2) O binds between Cu 1 and Cu 4 so that the oxygen of N 2 O replaces the oxygen ligand of Cu 4. Certain ligand imidazoles of Cu 1 and Cu 2, as well as of Cu 4, are located at the dimer interface. Particularly those of Cu 2 and Cu 4 are parts of a bonding network which couples these coppers to the Cu(A) centre in the neighbouring monomer. This structure may provide an efficient electron transfer path for reduction of the bound N 2 O...|$|R

The first process is a ratedetermining process, and the activation energy was estimated to be 30. 47 kcal/mol from density functional theory calculations considering electron correlation (B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G**).

40|$|Proline {{catabolism}} is {{the breakdown}} of proline to glutamate. This is catalyzed by two enzymes that can be either distinct, monofunctional enzymes or fused into one bifunctional enzyme. When the two enzymes are fused together they are linked by a large, internal, water filled cavity that can channel the intermediate between the two active sites. Using crystallography, kinetics, ligand soaking, and small angle X-ray scattering, this work studied substrate binding in the active sites and movement of the intermediate between active sites within the bifunctional enzyme. This work highlighted the importance of key residues involved in substrate binding, oligomerization, product release and even intermediate trafficking. Mutations of key residues highlighted gave a more in-depth look at the path the intermediate takes in the internal chamber, by blocking off different segments of the channel. Proline is soluble at high concentrations and was used to soak crystals of proline catabolic <b>enzymes.</b> High concentration <b>soaks</b> led to movements in the enzymes that were unexpected.

40|$|Palm kernel meal (PKM) and {{copra meal}} (CM) {{are derived from}} the nuts of palm trees and are {{available}} in large quantities in many tropical countries. These potential feedstuffs are not widely used either for animal production or other purposes. Due to their high fibre contents, imbalanced amino acids, Maillard products (due to heat damage during drying and oil extraction processes) and their susceptibility to mould attack, these by-products have been regarded as low quality feedstuffs. However, if their value could be improved so that their inclusion in animal feeds resulted in good production, {{there would be a}} large number of benefits. A total of ten experiments have been conducted {{to improve the quality of}} these ingredients in broiler diets. There are two main scenarios for improving their use as feedstuffs, namely, by addition of exogenous enzymes and nutrients which are deficient and by manipulation of the physical characteristics of the ingredients. This project investigated the physical characteristics (bulk density and water holding capacity) and feeding value of PKM and CM by feeding the pure PKM and CM plus additional vitamins and minerals in poultry diets. Improvement of the quality of PKM was mainly based on nutritional manipulation by considering the digestible amino acids of the diet and adding enzymes. To increase the feeding value of copra meal, physical treatments were proposed, along with using exogenous enzymes and formulating diets based on digestible amino acid. The physical treatments applied in this study were pelleting, crumbling, soaking and finely grinding the diets. Parameters measured were growth rate, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, feed digestibility, apparent metabolizable energy (AME) of the diet, passage rate, jejunal viscosity, gut dimensions and digesta weight. The results of the experiments using palm kernel meal showed that bulk density and water holding capacity were 0. 57 g/cm 3 and 2. 93 g water/g feed respectively. These values are close to the values of conventional feedstuffs tested in this study. Accordingly, PKM is neither bulky nor watery when soaked. Therefore, feed intake was not affected by PKM. Palm kernel meal contains 13. 6 % protein with high arginine content, being 19. 2 mg/g. Ileal digestibilities of crude protein, arginine, lysine and methionine in PKM were 53. 6, 81. 9, 57. 2 and 71. 5 % respectively. Palm kernel meal could be used up to 40 %, provided that energy and amino acids are balanced. Body weights of birds fed diets containing up to 40 % PKM in the diet were similar to the body weight of birds fed corn-soy diets. Feed digestibility was low in PKM based diets, due to the high dietary fibre, causing birds to consume large amounts of feed to gain optimal growth. Jejunal digesta viscosity of birds fed PKM based diets was low compared with those of birds fed a corn soy diet. The use of enzymes did not improve the birds production significantly. However, feed digestibility and AME of the diet were increased when enzymes were added to the diet. Analysis of CM indicated that is bulk density and water holding capacity were much less and much greater respectively than values for conventional feedstuffs, being about 0. 49 g/cm 3 for bulk density and 4. 14 g water/g feed for water holding capacity. Copra meal contains 21. 7 % crude protein with high arginine content (30. 5 mg/g) but low in lysine (5. 5 mg/g). Ileal digestibility of crude protein, arginine, lysine and methionine were 63. 1, 85. 6, 51. 3 and 71. 1 % respectively. The use of CM in the diet lowered feed digestibility and AME of the diet. The birds fed CM based diets consumed more water and less feed than did birds fed corn-soy (CS) diets. The use of enzymes did not improve the growth rate of birds in the starter period but they did increase it to a similar level compared to birds fed the CS diet when the birds were kept for six or more weeks. Soaking the diet gave similar results to the addition of enzymes. However, fine grinding either CM or the whole diet decreased the performance of birds. Significant improvement in the growth rate of birds was made when either CM or the diet was pelleted and fed as crumbles but not when the pelleted material was finely ground. Measurement of gut response of birds consuming CM showed that gizzard weight was increased when the birds were fed the unmodified CM or pelleted CM but not when fed fine ground, <b>soaked</b> or <b>enzyme</b> supplemented CM diets. However, the birds fed the CM based diet had heavier intestines than those of birds fed the CS diet. No doubt due to their larger body size, the beak size was bigger in birds fed larger feed particle sizes. There was a significant correlation between the size of the feed particles eaten by the birds and the width of the beak. The birds tended to prefer a feed particles size of 40 % of the width of the beak. Larger feed particle sizes travelled down the digestive tract faster than finer feed particle sizes thus increasing feed intake and hence growth rate. In conclusion, there was no deleterious effect in using up to 40 % PKM in the diet provided that the diet was balanced, particularly in digestible amino acids and energy. Enzyme supplementation increased the digestibility of PKM based diets. Even if CM based diets were balanced, the use of <b>enzymes,</b> <b>soaking</b> the diets or pelleting the CM diet was needed to improve the feeding value of CM...|$|R
40|$|Xylanases are {{enzymes that}} modify the {{physicochemical}} properties of xylans by hydrolyzing their backbone internally. They {{are often used}} in various biotechnological processes such as bread making, breakdown of biomass and paper manufacture to improve processing or product quality. The difference in functionality of xylanases in these processes is, however, large and is not yet fully understood. More in-depth knowledge on the enzyme biochemical features and structural elements is required to make further progress in this area. Studies investigating structure-function relationships in xylanases have recently revealed that, next to substrate binding in their active site, several single-module xylanases can also bind substrate molecules non-catalytically to a site on their enzyme surface. Review of the available literature in this dissertation shows that such sites, referred to as secondary binding sites (SBSs), occur in many other glycoside hydrolases upon structural analysis using X-ray crystallography with the <b>enzyme</b> <b>soaked</b> or co-crystallized with substrate molecules. Although, as for xylanases, the functionality of most of these sites {{has not yet been}} studied, a wide variety of functions has been hypothesized for SBSs: (1) targeting towards substrate and keeping the enzyme in close proximity with the (insoluble) substrate, (2) guiding the substrate into the active site groove, (3) disrupting ordered substrate structure to facilitate its breakdown, (4) enhancing processivity, (5) allosteric regulation, (6) passing on reaction products and (7) anchoring to the cell wall of the parent microorganism. Most of these putative functions have also been attributed to carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs). These more intensively studied structural elements are independent modules that are often attached to the catalytic module of an enzyme through a flexible linker sequence. The main function attributed to CBMs is clearly to target the attached catalytic modules towards their substrate and, subsequently, to keep them in the proximity of (insoluble) substrate surfaces. In view of the demonstrated importance of CBMs, and the possible similar function of SBSs, the latter structures present a clear target for study when trying to increase insight into xylanase functionality. Therefore, in this PhD dissertation, the functional relevance of the SBSs in the glycoside hydrolase family 11 (GH 11) xylanases of Bacillus subtilis (XBS) and Aspergillus niger (XAN), and in the GH 8 xylanase of Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (XPH) was investigated. To this end, the SBSs of the enzymes were modified through site-directed mutagenesis. Mutations were designed to either weaken or strengthen the SBSs of the mutated enzymes. After screening of sets of mutants, the activity and binding properties of selected and purified mutant enzymes were evaluated. Activity was tested on various chromophoric model substrates as well as on various natural xylans, both water-extractable or soluble and water-unextractable or insoluble xylans. Binding properties were investigated using both basic as well as more advanced biochemical and biophysical techniques. The SBSs of the two GH 11 xylanases, i. e. XBS and XAN, were demonstrated to have a large impact on substrate binding and to increase the efficiency of hydrolysis of polymeric substrates, both water-extractable and water-unextractable, relative to that of oligomeric substrates. Although the SBSs in XBS and XAN are located in different regions on the enzyme surface and are structurally totally different from each other, results showed that the functionality of both sites is similar. This may indicate that SBSs are used by a larger group of GH 11 xylanases as a mechanism to potentiate catalytic action. For XBS, further isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies underlined the importance of the SBS for substrate binding. The binding to the SBS of XBS was characterized by a comparable low mM range dissociation constant as the binding in the active site. A fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) study using XBS variants indicated that the SBS significantly affects the mobility of the enzyme. Lower affinity was correlated with higher mobility. Here, the effect of the SBS of XBS on mobility was attributed to a function in targeting of the enzyme towards its substrate. This was thought to affect the binding frequency of the enzyme on the substrate surfaces. However, next to targeting, the SBS in GH 11 xylanases was also believed to have an additional role in potentiating catalytic action. The earlier observation that binding of larger substrates to SBS and active site is cooperative and several observations made in this dissertation strengthened the hypothesis that the SBS assists hydrolysis by orienting substrate correctly, thereby guiding it into the active site cleft for subsequent hydrolysis: (1) the functionality of the SBS was generally limited to substrates which can reach both the SBS and the active site simultaneously, (2) the SBS affected the activity on the more flexible water-extractable arabinoxylan to larger extent than that on the more rigid water-unextractable arabinoxylan and (3) higher affinity did not always result in higher activity. The impact of the SBS on the activity of the GH 8 xylanase, i. e. XPH, was limited to insoluble substrates, while activity on soluble substrates was largely unaffected. Unexpectedly, the activity on a soluble oligomeric substrate was also slightly affected for some mutants. Moreover, results on a chromophoric polymeric model substrate were in contrast with the trends observed on the corresponding natural substrate. All in all, results on various substrates showed that the SBS in XPH has a different functionality than in the GH 11 enzymes, but does resemble that of many CBMs. In conclusion, the results presented in this dissertation show that SBSs are functionally relevant structural elements in the studied xylanases. SBS functionality in the GH 8 xylanase, however, differs from that in the two studied GH 11 xylanases. In both GH 8 and GH 11, a function in targeting of the enzyme towards substrate was suggested. Additionally, the SBSs in the GH 11 xylanases possibly assist catalysis by guiding substrate into the active site. The here suggested functional roles are also in line with those attributed to SBSs in various other glycoside hydrolases. For most enzymes, including xylanases, SBSs appear to be an efficient tool to potentiate their catalytic action, thereby compensating for a possible lack of CBMs. DANKWOORD			 TABLE OF CONTENTS	i SUMMARY	v SAMENVATTING	ix CONTEXT AND AIMS	 1 PART ONE - LITERATURE REVIEW	 5 CHAPTER ONE - XYLANS AND XYLANASES	 7 1. 1 	XYLANS… [...] . 	 7 1. 1. 1 	Occurrence and structural diversity of xylans	 7 1. 1. 2 	Physicochemical and nutritional properties of xylans	 10 1. 1. 3 	Enzymic degradation of xylans	 11 1. 2 	XYLANASES. 	 12 1. 2. 1 	Classification and structure	 13 1. 2. 2 	Catalytic mechanism	 18 1. 2. 3 	Functional properties of xylanases	 19 1. 2. 4 	Use of xylanases in industrial applications	 21 CHAPTER TWO - SECONDARY BINDING SITES IN GLYCOSIDE HYDROLASES	 25 2. 1 	INTRODUCTION	 25 2. 2 	α-AMYLASES	 28 2. 2. 1 	Mammalian α-amylases	 29 2. 2. 2 	Barley α-amylases	 30 2. 2. 3 	Other α-amylases	 32 2. 2. 4 	Common SBS architecture	 32 2. 3 	OTHER AMYLOLYTIC ENZYMES	 33 2. 3. 1 	β-Amylase	 33 2. 3. 2 	Glucoamylase	 33 2. 3. 3 	Trehalohydrolase	 34 2. 4 	TRANSGLYCOSIDASES	 34 2. 4. 1 	Cyclodextrin gluconotransferases	 34 2. 4. 2 	Amylosucrase	 36 2. 4. 3 	Amylomaltase	 36 2. 5 	XYLANASES… [...] 	 37 2. 6 	OTHER GLYCOSIDE HYDROLASES	 39 2. 6. 1 	β-Agarase	 39 2. 6. 2 	β-Glucosidases	 39 2. 6. 3 	α-Galactosidase	 40 2. 7 	FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF SBSS	 40 PART TWO - EXPERIMENTAL WORK	 45 CHAPTER THREE - FUNCTIONAL RELEVANCE OF SECONDARY BINDING SITES IN THE GLYCOSIDE HYDROLASE FAMILY 11 XYLANASES FROM BACILLUS SUBTILIS AND ASPERGILLUS NIGER	 47 3. 1 	INTRODUCTION	 47 3. 2 	MATERIALS AND METHODS	 49 3. 2. 1 	Materials	 49 3. 2. 2 	Substrates	 49 3. 2. 3 	Site-directed mutagenesis	 49 3. 2. 4 	Recombinant expression	 50 3. 2. 5 	Protein purification	 52 3. 2. 6 	Protein quantification	 53 3. 2. 7 	Activity assays	 53 3. 2. 8 	Temperature and pH optima	 55 3. 2. 9 	Binding affinity towards insoluble polymers	 56 3. 3 	RESULTS AND DISCUSSION	 57 3. 3. 1 	Genetic engineering of the SBS	 57 3. 3. 2 	Screening procedure	 57 3. 3. 3 	Activity measurements	 60 3. 3. 4 	Binding affinity towards insoluble polymers	 67 3. 3. 5 	Relevance of the present findings	 70 3. 4 	CONCLUSIONS	 71 CHAPTER FOUR - USE OF ISOTHERMAL TITRATION CALORIMETRY AND SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE TO QUANTIFY BINDING TO THE DIFFERENT BINDING SITES IN THE BACILLUS SUBTILIS XYLANASE	 73 4. 1 	INTRODUCTION	 73 4. 2 	MATERIALS AND METHODS	 74 4. 2. 1 	Materials	 74 4. 2. 2 	Recombinant production and purification of xylanases	 74 4. 2. 3 	Blocking the active site of XBS with a covalent inhibitor	 75 4. 2. 4 	Isothermal titration calorimetry. 	 75 4. 2. 5 	Surface plasmon resonance	 75 4. 3 	RESULTS…. 	 76 4. 3. 1 	Enzymes	 76 4. 3. 2 	Isothermal titration calorimetry	 77 4. 3. 3 	Surface plasmon resonance	 79 4. 4 	DISCUSSION	 81 4. 5 	CONCLUSIONS	 82 CHAPTER FIVE - SECONDARY SUBSTRATE BINDING AFFECTS THE MOBILITY OF THE BACILLUS SUBTILIS XYLANASE AS ASSESSED BY FLUORESCENCE RECOVERY AFTER PHOTOBLEACHING	 83 5. 1 	INTRODUCTION	 83 5. 2 	MATERIALS AND METHODS	 84 5. 2. 1 	Materials	 84 5. 2. 2 	Substrate characterization and immobilization	 85 5. 2. 3 	Recombinant production and purification of xylanases	 85 5. 2. 4 	Labeling of XBS	 85 5. 2. 5 	Xylanase activity	 86 5. 2. 6 	FRAP experiments	 86 5. 2. 7 	Data analysis	 87 5. 3 	RESULTS AND DISCUSSION	 89 5. 3. 1 	Production and characterization of labeled enzymes and substrate surface	 89 5. 3. 2 	FRAP optimization, data fitting and mobility of the wild-type XBS	 91 5. 3. 3 	Mobility of enzymes with a modified SBS	 95 5. 3. 4 	Mobility of the inactive XBS	 97 5. 3. 5 	Relevance of the present findings	 98 5. 4 	CONCLUSIONS	 99 CHAPTER SIX - FUNCTIONAL RELEVANCE OF THE SECONDARY BINDING SITE IN THE GLYCOSIDE HYDROLASE FAMILY 8 XYLANASE FROM PSEUDOALTEROMONAS HALOPLANKTIS	 101 6. 1 	INTRODUCTION	 101 6. 2 	MATERIALS AND METHODS	 103 6. 2. 1 	Materials and substrates	 103 6. 2. 2 	Site-directed mutagenesis	 103 6. 2. 3 	Recombinant expression and purification	 104 6. 2. 4 	Enzyme activity assays	 105 6. 2. 5 	Temperature and pH optima	 106 6. 2. 6 	Binding affinity towards insoluble polymers	 106 6. 3 	RESULTS… [...] 	 106 6. 3. 1 	Genetic engineering of the SBS	 106 6. 3. 2 	Activity based screening of XPH mutants with a modified SBS	 108 6. 3. 3 	Binding affinity and activity on various substrates	 109 6. 4 	DISCUSSION	 115 6. 4. 1 	Genetic engineering of the SBS	 115 6. 4. 2 	Activity on soluble and water-extractable xylans	 115 6. 4. 3 	Activity on insoluble and water-unextractable xylans	 116 6. 4. 4 	Relevance of the present findings	 117 6. 5 	CONCLUSIONS	 118 GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES FOR FUTURE WORK	 119 REFERENCES	 123 LIST OF PUBLICATIONS	 139 LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS	 141 nrpages: 142 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 A {{series of}} four animal {{experiments}} utilizing 129 pigs and associated laboratory studies {{was conducted to}} study {{the causes of the}} lowered performance on high barley rations fed to swine. Previous work at this Station has shown barley to have a value of 80 - 85 percent of corn for swine, and demonstrated that barley hull is responsible for the major part of the growth depression when it is present in swine rations. Numerous trials have been conducted at this Station to overcome the limitation imposed by hull material in high barley swine rations. Outside of pearling, which was completely successful in overcoming the depressive effect of barley; <b>soaking,</b> <b>enzyme</b> treatment, pelleting, and the addition of fat have been used with varying degrees of success. Pelleting has been the most successful of the latter four treatments, yet its beneficial effect is lost upon regrinding of the pellets. Recent work has indicated that soaking high barley swine feeds may be beneficial. The recent finding that antibiotics interfere with nutritional improvement of barley for poultry during water treatment suggested that a part of the benefit of soaking had been lost due to the presence of antibiotics in the swine rations. Addition of enzymes specific for cellulose, the major structural component of barley hull, has not been demonstrated to be of any advantage, yet conditions have not been optimum in terms of the enzyme's potential activity. These findings were considered in the objectives and design of the experiments described herein. Ground and whole barley were soaked for 24 hours at 30 C. before being mixed with the protein supplement just prior to feeding. Pigs receiving ground, soaked barley grew 4. 2 percent faster on 3. 2 percent less feed compared to the same ration fed dry but these differences were not significant. Pigs receiving soaked whole barley grew 12. 2 percent slower and required 17. 0 percent more feed than those which received the ground soaked barley ration. These differences were significant (P<. 01). Pigs receiving whole barley soaked with constant aeration and with added cellulase 4000 enzyme did not differ significantly in growth rate nor feed efficiency from a lot which received whole, soaked barley. There was a six percent reduction in the cellulose content of barley treated with the enzyme preparation. The addition of five percent fat to a high barley ration improved feed efficiency but not rate of gain. The production of a pellet containing five percent added fat with the same density as the pelleted control ration, through use of a specially-constructed die, resulted in increases in both rate and efficiency of gain. Fatness as measured by back fat thickness was significantly increased by the fat-containing pellet. Feed waste and its causes were studied. Waste varied from 3 to 25 percent with group-fed pigs depending upon the form of the ration and the type of feeder used. Individually-fed pigs wasted from 7 to 36 percent of the feed when fed alike indicating that waste varies greatly from one pig to another. Pelleting of a meal ration reduced the amount of feed wasted from an average of 12. 18 to 3. 08 percent. Pigs consume more pellets than meal of similar composition even though the apparent disappearance from the feeder of the two forms is similar. Electronic measurement of feeding time showed that pigs spent 16. 74 percent of the day consuming meal and only 7. 34 percent of the day eating pellets of the same composition. A photographic study and close observation showed that pigs fed meal spend considerable time sorting out barley hull. Chemical analysis of the material wasted out of the feeders had a fiber content 2. 5 times as high as the original ration. The studies reconfirm the conclusion that hull is primarily responsible for the lowered performance of barley rations. Barley hull splinters which result from grinding the grain apparently reduce the amount of feed the animal will consume while increasing feeding time and feed waste. Pelleting enables the animal to consume more of the ration in less time with less waste. The limitation imposed by barley hull upon swine performance appears {{to be associated with the}} prehension of feed rather than exclusively with mechanical interference in digestion and absorption of nutrients as previously believed...|$|R
40|$|As {{media for}} biocatalysis, imidazolium based ionic liquids (ILs) have many applications, {{including}} improving enzyme refolding, selectivity, and replacing organic solvents as either the bulk media or cosolvent for biocatalysis. Despite their potential as media for biocatalysis, however, ILs have received underwhelming results {{due to the}} broad inactivation of enzymes in this media. Activity profiles of enzymes in increasing concentrations of the ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride ([BMIM][Cl]) show increasing deactivation over time. The deactivation appears unrelated to protein solubility losses but correlated with unfolding based on ultra-violet spectroscopy and fluorescence measurements, respectively. Additionally, equilibrium dialysis measurements show increased IL-enzyme binding at higher concentrations where the enzyme {{is thought to be}} unfolded. Increased binding to the denatured state will favor unfolding. Crystallographic studies further shed light on enzyme-IL binding by finding the binding modes of [BMIM][Cl] with enzymes tend to be based on cation-π stacking and hydrophobic interactions. Aromatic and hydrophobic groups are typically in the core of proteins. Unfolding will therefore expose these binding sites allowing for increased binding, as seen in the equilibrium dialysis results. Our approach to stabilize enzymes in ILs was to mediate preferential IL-enzyme binding. There is a non-specific and site-specific mechanism by which enzymes are proposed to be stabilized. The non-specific approach is based on mutating residues to negatively charged amino acids. The negative charge is thought to repel the anion, [Cl], more than it attracts the cation, [BMIM], resulting in a net preferential exclusion of the IL. This non-specific preferential exclusion will, hypothetically, drive native state formation based on surface tension effects around the negative charge much like trehalose or other non-specifically excluded osmolytes. Alternatively, specific 2 ̆ 2 high-affinity 2 ̆ 2 sites where [BMIM][Cl] binds may be targeted such as tyrosines. If a tyrosine is exposed in the native state, it can likely still only bind one [BMIM] molecule from the exposed side. In the unfolded state, the tyrosine can now bind two [BMIM] molecules (one on either side). In theory, mutation of this high affinity residue will result in stabilization by eliminating one binding site in the folded protein and two binding sites in the unfolded protein. Non-specific chemical modification approaches to model enzymes found that, in four cases, removing positively charged residues for a neutral moiety improved enzyme activity retention. Meanwhile, in all four cases, removing negatively charged residues for a neutral moiety was deleterious for enzyme stability. Certainly, this observation {{is a result of the}} total stability of the enzyme, which is the sum of its intrinsic stability (i. e. in buffer alone) and its ability to favorably mediate IL-solvent interactions. However, it was found that the intrinsic stability, measured via urea unfolding midpoint in buffer, was lower for all variants than the wild-type for two enzymes (the other two were not measured). While enzyme stabilization in ionic liquids may not be achieved via this chemical modification with every enzyme, it provides support for surface charge as a tool to non-specifically alter enzyme stability in ILs. A site-specific approach to mediating binding interactions was employed using 2 D HSQC NMR. [BMIM][Cl] was titrated into the enzyme sample, and perturbations in the resonance values of various peaks were observed. These peaks were interpreted as binding sites. In support of this, <b>soaking</b> <b>enzyme</b> crystals in [BMIM][Cl] resulted in resolution of [BMIM] and [Cl] molecules surrounding the residues with the largest resonance perturbations. Mutation to a glutamic acid at the location with the largest perturbations resulted in decreased chemical shift perturbations of the amino acids surrounding the mutation upon titration of the mutant enzyme with [BMIM][Cl]. Mutagenesis also resulted in an enhanced activity retention profile in [BMIM][Cl]. Moreover, two highly exposed positive charges on the enzyme were mutated to a glutamic acid in attempt to non-specifically exclude [BMIM][Cl]. Both mutations resulted in enhanced activity retention of the enzyme in [BMIM][Cl], although to varying degrees. Combination of stabilizing mutations around the surface of the enzyme provided an additive effect on stability. The mutations did not, however, improve the melting temperature of the enzyme in the absence of IL, suggesting the intrinsic stability of the enzyme in buffer was not enhanced. Moreover, activity retention profiles in [BMIM][Cl] show an equilibrium being achieved which is higher for the mutant enzyme than the wild-type, suggesting thermodynamic stabilization, and not purely a kinetic effect based on altering the unfolding barrier. Crystallographic studies of the mutant and wild-type enzymes showed a [BMIM] molecule resolved at tyrosine 49 for the wild-type enzyme, but not at glutamic acid 49 in the mutant. Also, equilibrium dialysis suggested decreased binding of [BMIM][Cl] to the mutant relative to the wild-type enzyme, consistent with the proposed mechanism of stabilization via reducing IL-enzyme binding, which would be stronger (and therefore more reduced by mutation) in the denatured state...|$|R
