5|$|Choosing {{to support}} a Reason {{will result in a}} {{different}} ending <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>who</b> is chosen, but in each the world is reborn {{in the image of the}} chosen Reason after the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi to prove his resolve. Chiaki and Isamu die before the Demi-fiend begins and give him their blessing in spirit form, while Hikawa accompanies the Demi-fiend into their new world. If Takao's wishes are followed, the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi and the world is returned to its pre-Conception state, resurrecting and restoring all the main characters. If the Demi-fiend rejects Takao's wishes, Kagutsuchi curses him for allowing the world to die and departs, leaving the Demi-fiend as the only survivor in a barren world of demons, trapped as it is until another Conception can happen. If the Demi-fiend fulfills Lucifer's request of collecting the Candelabra from the Fiends, Kagutsuchi attacks him and is destroyed, breaking the Great Will's control over the worlds. After this, Lucifer fights the Demi-fiend to test his strength, then declares him to be the ultimate weapon in the upcoming war against the Great Will.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{first came}} to know Florence Kling, five years older than he, as the {{daughter}} of a local banker and developer. Amos Kling was a man accustomed to getting his way, but Harding attacked him relentlessly in the paper. Amos involved Florence in all his affairs, taking her to work from the time she could walk. As hard-headed as her father, Florence came into conflict with him after returning from music college. After she eloped with Pete deWolfe, and returned to Marion without deWolfe, but with an infant called Marshall, Amos agreed to raise the boy, but would not support Florence, who made a living as a piano teacher. One of her students was Harding's sister Charity. By 1886, Florence Kling had obtained a divorce, and she and Warren Harding were courting, though who was pursuing whom is uncertain, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>who</b> later told the story of their romance.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} nonlinear gameplay, allowing multiple {{different ways}} to achieve objectives. This includes travelling between different areas in an open world and making choices that determine the dialogues and order of events as well as alternative endings <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>who</b> the player identifies as the culprit. However, {{only one of the}} characters is the true culprit, while the others are red herrings; if the player closes the case with the wrong culprit, then the player will face criticism from the police chief and need to re-open the case. The game includes a phone {{that could be used to}} manually dial any number, which is needed to contact several non-player characters. The game also features an inventory system requiring the examination and collection of items, which could be used as evidence later in the game.|$|E

They shared staff, which was directed by either of them <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>who</b> was on site. Such collaborative work, which has already been noted at San Pietro in Oliveto are emblematic of Cairano's artistic activity, which became increasingly busy and varied as public and private commissions poured {{in the first decade}} of the sixteenth century following the work at the Loggia palazzo. However, Cairano's attention was not directed to Salò, which he visited rarely, or even to San Pietro in Oliveto, which was mainly run by Sanmicheli, but to two works of greater importance and resonance: the grand staircase of the Loggia and the arch at Sant'Apollonio.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} rounds in a match of Blitz, where two teams of four {{computer}} or human players score points for each energized Blitz disc thrown through their opponent's hoop, which is eight {{feet off the}} ground. Players pass and travel with the disc across the arenas, and the game continues without pause between points scored. The team with the most points {{at the end of}} a match wins. Players can choose to brawl when not scoring points. Fighting depletes character health, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>who</b> takes the blows. Once his health is completely depleted, a character is removed from the game, and teams with all players knocked out are disqualified (though players can be substituted between rounds). If a player tends towards belligerence, the game's artificial intelligence will compensate and exact revenge for its teammates. Friendly fire, where teammates can intentionally or inadvertently hurt each other with attacks meant for their opponents, is permitted.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey {{accepted}} Burchard's {{appointment in}} December 1189, but then excommunicated Burchard in January 1190. The excommunication, which was shared with Henry Marshal, was retaliation for {{a dispute with}} the archbishop-elect that happened during a church service. The actual dispute occurred on 5 January 1190 when Burchard and Marshal were conducting vespers, either early or on time, depending on whose side was telling the story. Geoffrey appeared {{in the middle of}} their service and attempted to perform the same service, either late or on time, again <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>who</b> was relating the story. When Burchard and Marshal finished their service, they put out all the lights in the church, leaving the archbishop in the dark. Despite that, he finished the service but then complained to the cathedral chapter of York about the incident. Attempts to mediate a dispute led nowhere, and the citizens of York soon became involved. Geoffrey attempted to keep the townspeople from abusing his two opponents, but Burchard was eventually forced to take refuge in the tomb of William of York, an earlier Archbishop of York. Hugh du Puiset then intervened with the king, and Geoffrey once more lost the royal favour. The king sent Burchard to Rome, along with Reginald fitzJocelin the Bishop of Bath, to attempt to secure the deposition of Geoffrey from York. Although Burchard's efforts in Rome in mid-1190 contributed to a papal prohibition on Geoffrey's consecration by Pope Clement III, Geoffrey was not deposed. Burchard did secure his own absolution of the excommunication placed by Geoffrey in January.|$|E

5|$|The {{basic concept}} of SaGa Frontier {{is based on}} its Free Scenario System, in which one can play as any of seven {{different}} protagonists, all of whom exist in the same setting: a solar system known as The Regions, a group of planets, {{each with its own}} culture, game-level of technology, and form of magic. The game is considered non-linear, in that from the beginning many of the characters are free to go almost anywhere and interact with almost anyone. Travel through most of the Regions is easy due to inter-regional ships traveling regularly between them. The player controls the protagonist on the field screen, a set of interconnecting pre-rendered backgrounds, and is able to speak with a slew of other characters in order to gather information, recruit party members, and initiate quests. Each character has his or her own storyline and a main quest to fulfill, but there are also several optional quests that any of the characters can participate in. Some of the main characters even encounter each other during their quests. The storyline of each character also changes <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>who</b> is chosen, what is said in conversation, what events have already occurred, and who the protagonist has in his or her party, a concept first introduced in Romancing SaGa 2.|$|E
