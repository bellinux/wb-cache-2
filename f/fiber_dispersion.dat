40|$|Abstract — In {{designing}} of SM <b>fibers,</b> <b>dispersion</b> {{behavior is}} a major distinguishing feature which limits long distance and high speed transmission. Dispersion of SMF is lowest at 1. 3 um, but the attenuation is minimum at 1. 55 um. At 1. 55 um dispersion is higher. For achieving maximum transmission distance in a high capacity link,dispersion null {{should be at the}} wavelength of minimum attenuation. This may be achieved by mechanisms like reduction in fiber core with an accompanying increase in the relative RI to create <b>Dispersion</b> Shifted <b>Fibers</b> (DCF) [3]. In the proposed work by optimizing the fiber profile a <b>fiber</b> with minimum <b>dispersion</b> slope at the desired wavelength will be carried out...|$|R

Also, we have demonstrated that the system transmission performance depends, strongly, on the Directly Modulated Laser (DML) output power and its adiabatic and transient chirp parameters. We have calculated by simulation, {{that the effect of}} DMLs chirp can be compensated by a negative <b>dispersion</b> <b>fiber</b> in a specific range of the DML output power. In addition, a pulse broadened by the positive <b>dispersion</b> <b>fiber</b> can be equalized using self-phase-modulation (SPM) in the optical fiber. The majority of metro and access networks are made up of conventional single-mode fibers (SMF) which are positive <b>dispersion</b> <b>fibers.</b> We have demonstrated that the optimum compensation is always feasible for such fibers by changing the optical output power in the DML laser. Furthermore, simulations suggest that this technique is able to enhance the performance of directly modulated wavelength division multiplexed systems if the power of each channel is chosen correctly.

50|$|In {{single-mode}} fiber performance is primarily limited by chromatic dispersion (also called group velocity dispersion), which occurs because {{the index of}} the glass varies slightly depending on the wavelength of the light, and light from real optical transmitters necessarily has nonzero spectral width (due to modulation). Polarization mode dispersion, another source of limitation, occurs because although the {{single-mode fiber}} can sustain only one transverse mode, it can carry this mode with two different polarizations, and slight imperfections or distortions in a fiber can alter the propagation velocities for the two polarizations. This phenomenon is called fiber birefringence and can be counteracted by polarization-maintaining optical <b>fiber.</b> <b>Dispersion</b> limits the bandwidth of the fiber because the spreading optical pulse limits the rate that pulses can follow one another on the fiber and still be distinguishable at the receiver.|$|E

40|$|The area of {{the digital}} image {{processing}} is getting more attention {{in the hope that}} it will increase the accuracy of any scientific measurements, such as in determining an object velocity, temperature, and size. While human vision is excellent to recognize and differentiate objects, it has been proven to be a poor tool when it comes to measure the object performance. One of many digital image processing applications is texture analysis whose purpose is to evaluate image patterns. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the use of texture analysis as a tool to micro <b>fiber</b> <b>dispersion</b> measurement. Micro <b>fiber</b> <b>dispersion</b> can be found in many applications such as in paper and industry powder engineering. 	Three cases related to micro <b>fiber</b> <b>dispersion</b> were investigated in this study. The first case was the experimental study of the dispersion in open water channel. Sets of synthetic fibers were put into water channel to simulate a process that can be found in papermaking industry. The research investigated the effect of three operating parameters: fluid velocity, fiber consistency, and fiber aspect ratio to <b>fiber</b> <b>dispersion.</b> Using two-factorial experimental design technique, the main and interaction effects of these parameters were evaluated. The study found that increasing fluid velocity, fiber aspect ratio, and consistency decreased the dispersion level. The study also found that the effect of individual parameters is more pronounced than the role of the interactive terms on the fiber flocculation. 	The second case considered was applying the <b>fiber</b> <b>dispersion</b> analysis to computer-synthesized images consisting of different arrangements of fibers. Four sets of sub-cases were presented. These sub-cases were divided based on the fiber-concentrated location and fiber distribution. The use of computer-synthesized images was found to be very useful to simulate real situation during <b>fiber</b> <b>dispersion.</b> 	The third case investigated the fiber distribution on a dry paper. Images for different types of paper were taken and evaluated to see the dispersion level of each type of paper. It was found that the current texture analysis was applicable to determine the dispersion level for dry papers. 	While three cases indicated that the texture analysis can be used to investigate the <b>fiber</b> <b>dispersion,</b> the texture analysis used here is not a perfect and universal method and may not be suitable to analyze other types of dispersions. The human vision will always be essential to determine if the texture analysis is applicable to any other problem...|$|E
