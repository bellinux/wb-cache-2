5|$|At {{the end of}} 1926, Rix Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond {{together}} {{returned to}} Australia. <b>Energised</b> by her success, Rix Nicholas purchased a car, filled its rear compartment with painting equipment, and the pair set out to paint the landscape, ranging from Canberra and the Monaro plains to the south, up into central Queensland. This included a publicity-attracting occasion where she painted figures {{on the beach at}} Bondi, reported by various publications including Australian magazine, The Home.|$|E
5|$|Ahmedabad {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} economic and industrial hub in India. It is the second largest producer of cotton in India, and its stock exchange is the country's second oldest. Cricket is a popular sport in Ahmedabad, which houses the 54,000-seat Sardar Patel Stadium. The effects of liberalisation of the Indian economy have <b>energised</b> the city's economy towards tertiary sector activities such as commerce, communication and construction. Ahmedabad's increasing population has resulted {{in an increase in}} the construction and housing industries resulting in recent development of skyscrapers.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} the leadership, Whitlam reorganised the ALP caucus, {{assigning}} portfolios and turning the Labor frontbench into a shadow cabinet. While the Liberal-Country Coalition had a huge majority in the House of Representatives, Whitlam <b>energised</b> the party by campaigning intensively to win two by-elections in 1967: first in Corio in Victoria, and later that year in Capricornia (Queensland). The November half-Senate election saw a moderate swing to Labor and against the Coalition, compared with the general election the previous year. These federal victories, in which both Whitlam and Holt campaigned, helped give Whitlam the leverage he needed to carry out party reforms.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to measure the effects of <b>energising</b> drinks containing caffeine and glucose, upon mental activity during sustained selective attention. Non-invasive electrophysiological brain recordings were made during a behavioural study of selective attention in which participants received either <b>energising</b> or placebo drinks. We tested specifically whether <b>energising</b> drinks have significant effects upon behavioural measures of performance during a task requiring sustained visual selective attention, as well as on accompanying components of the event-related potential (ERPs) related to information processing in the brain. Forty healthy volunteers were blindly assigned to receive either the <b>energising</b> drink or a similar-tasting placebo drink. The behavioural task involved identifying predefined target stimulus among rapidly presented streams of peripheral visual stimuli, and making speeded motor responses to this stimulus. During task performance, accuracy, reaction times and ongoing brain activity were stored for analysis. The <b>energising</b> drink enhanced behavioural performance both in terms of accuracy and speed of reactions. The <b>energising</b> drink also had significant effects upon the event-related potentials. Effects started from the enhancement of the earliest components (Cl/P 1), reflecting early visual cortical processing in the energising-drink group relative to the placebo group over the contralateral scalp. The later N 1, N 2 and P 3 components related to decision-making and responses were also modulated by the <b>energising</b> drink. <b>Energising</b> drinks containing caffeine and glucose can enhance behavioural performance during demanding tasks requiring selective attention. The behavioural benefits are coupled to direct effects upon neural information processing...|$|R

5|$|The cup {{appears in}} another {{inventory}} of CharlesV in 1400, {{and then is}} not recorded until it appears as the property of another royal uncle, and collector, John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford (1389–1435), son of HenryIV, who was briefly Regent of both France and England for his infant nephew HenryVI. How he acquired the cup is not known, {{but he would have}} received many gifts from CharlesVI, and had both lent the king money and bought from him things such as the library of the Palais du Louvre, in the uneasy period when Charles had made peace with the English and made HenryV his heir. After the death of his brother HenryV, Bedford struggled to stem the resurgent French resistance, which was <b>energised</b> by Joan of Arc. He died in Normandy in 1435, leaving HenryVI as his heir.|$|E
5|$|In {{engineering}} or household applications, {{current is}} often described as being either direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC). These terms refer to how the current varies in time. Direct current, as produced by example from a battery and required by most electronic devices, is a unidirectional flow from the positive part of a circuit to the negative. If, as is most common, this flow is carried by electrons, they will be travelling in the opposite direction. Alternating current is any current that reverses direction repeatedly; almost always this {{takes the form of a}} sine wave. Alternating current thus pulses back and forth within a conductor without the charge moving any net distance over time. The time-averaged value of an alternating current is zero, but it delivers energy in first one direction, and then the reverse. Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance. These properties however can become important when circuitry is subjected to transients, such as when first <b>energised.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{last half}} of the century's first decade was a time of sorrow, {{loneliness}} and constant work for Pankhurst. In 1907 she sold her home in Manchester and began an itinerant lifestyle, moving from place to place as she spoke and marched for women's suffrage. She stayed with friends and in hotels, carrying her few possessions in suitcases. Although she was <b>energised</b> by the struggle–and found joy in giving energy to others– her constant travelling meant separation from her children, especially Christabel, who had become the national coordinator of the WSPU. In 1909, as Pankhurst planned a speaking tour of the United States, Harry was paralysed after his spinal cord became inflamed. She hesitated to leave the country while he was ill, but she needed money to pay for his treatment and the tour promised to be lucrative. On her return from a successful tour, she sat by Harry's bedside as he died on 5 January 1910. Five days later she buried her son, then spoke before 5,000 people in Manchester. Liberal Party supporters who had come to heckle her remained quiet as she addressed the crowd.|$|E

25|$|The relay's {{primary winding}} is {{supplied}} {{from the power}} systems current transformer via a plug bridge, which is called the plug setting multiplier (psm). Usually seven equally spaced tappings or operating bands determine the relays sensitivity. The primary winding {{is located on the}} upper electromagnet. The secondary winding has connections on the upper electromagnet that are <b>energised</b> from the primary winding and connected to the lower electromagnet. Once the upper and lower electromagnets are <b>energised</b> they produce eddy currents that are induced onto the metal disc and flow through the flux paths. This relationship of eddy currents and fluxes creates torque proportional to the input current of the primary winding, due to the two flux paths being out of phase by 90°.|$|E

25|$|Generally {{the plug}} is the movable {{connector}} attached to an electrically operated device's mains cable, and the socket is fixed on equipment or a building structure {{and connected to}} an <b>energised</b> electrical circuit. The plug has protruding pins or, in US terminology, blades (referred to as male) that fit into matching slots or holes (called female) in the sockets. A plug is defined in IEC 60050 as an accessory having pins designed to engage with the contacts of a socket-outlet, also incorporating means for the electrical connection and mechanical retention of flexible cables or cords; a plug does not contain components which modify the electrical output from the electrical input (except where a switch and/or fuse is provided {{as a means of}} disconnecting the output from input). There is an erroneous tendency to refer to power conversion devices with incorporated plug pins as plugs, but IEC 60050 refers to these as 'direct plug-in equipment', defined as equipment in which the mains plug forms {{an integral part of the}} equipment enclosure so that the equipment is supported by the mains socket-outlet. In this article, the term 'plug' is used in the sense defined by IEC 60050. Sockets are designed to prevent exposure of bare <b>energised</b> contacts. Sockets may also have protruding exposed contacts, but these are used exclusively for grounding (earthing).|$|E

25|$|In 2012, {{physicist}} Harold White and collaborators {{announced that}} modifying {{the geometry of}} exotic matter could reduce the mass–energy requirements for a macroscopic space ship from {{the equivalent of the}} planet Jupiter to that of the Voyager 1 spacecraft (~700kg) or less, and stated their intent to perform small-scale experiments in constructing warp fields. White proposed changing the shape of the warp bubble from a sphere to a torus. Furthermore, if the intensity of the space warp can be oscillated over time, the energy required is reduced even more. According to White, a modified Michelson–Morley interferometer could test the idea: one of the legs of the interferometer would appear to have a slightly different length when the test devices were <b>energised.</b>|$|E
