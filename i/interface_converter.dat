40|$|The {{integration}} {{of renewable energy}} sources in modern electric grids have drawn increasing attention nowadays. In order to effectively manage large-scale renewable energy sources and achieve flexible and efficient operation, the concept of microgrids have been proposed. Considering the nature of DC outputs in many distributed energy resources (DERs), DC microgrids have been extensively studied in the past years. Among the operational issues in DC microgrids, current sharing issues have become an important topic since it is highly relevant to the operation of DC microgrids. By adopting a proper design of current sharing strategy in DC microgrids, the current rating violations in each <b>interface</b> <b>converter</b> can be successfully avoided. In this paper, a looped-chain-based active current sharing strategy is proposed to realize high accuracy current sharing in DC microgrids. In particular, the output current is shared between the neighboring interface converters. Hence, following a clockwise or counter-clockwise order, a looped-chain-based control diagram can be established to share the reference value of the output current. A final status in the whole DC microgrid is that the output current of every <b>interface</b> <b>converter</b> is equalized. Hence, the desired current sharing objective can be satisfied. A MATLAB simulation model is established to verify the proposed looped-chain-based active current sharing strategy in DC microgrids...|$|E

30|$|In the multi-bus microgrid, the DG <b>interfacing</b> <b>converters</b> can be {{considered}} as active cells for control and management purposes [10, 11]. Although the DG <b>interfacing</b> <b>converters</b> may introduce harmonics into the power network, and cause power quality issues, they are also able to improve system efficiency and power quality if designed and controlled properly. Thus, DG units have the ability to enhance the power quality as well as the reliability of microgrids. Using DG units as harmonics compensators can reduce the need for adding extra devices in multi-bus microgrids. This leads to the result that a significant growth of DG penetration in multi-bus microgrids will require new control scheme in order to exploit the power quality improvement capability of DG units. Therefore, a merging concept is to use these power electronic interfaced DG systems to simultaneously realize real power generation and harmonic compensation functions.|$|R
