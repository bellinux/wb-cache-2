5|$|The Russian Air Force, which {{operates}} {{the largest number}} of Su-25s, planned to upgrade older aircraft to the Su-25SM variant, but funding shortfalls <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> the progress; by early 2007 only seven aircraft had been modified.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of nationalisation, {{interchanges}} were provided between the lines previously belonging to the three different companies that built them (AATC, CHADOPyF and Lacroze) since previously only the CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) had formal connections between them. However, the rate of expansion of the network during this period <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> considerably and only one station was opened during the 1970s.|$|E

These dates were based on McCarran reaching 90% (49.5 million passengers) of its projected capacity of 55 million passengers in 2017. At that time, McCarran {{was expected to be}} at 55 million passengers in 2011. The economic recession of 2007-2010 <b>has</b> <b>slowed</b> demand considerably in the Las Vegas region and as a result, planning for the airport <b>has</b> <b>slowed.</b> The federal environmental review process has been temporarily suspended and planning <b>has</b> <b>slowed</b> as well.|$|R
5|$|The FIA {{released}} its initial findings {{at a special}} conference held during the inaugural Russian Grand Prix on the Saturday after the Japanese Grand Prix weekend. Among other things, {{it was revealed that}} Bianchi <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> down at Suzuka's Turn 7 but without disclosing by what margin or the speed of impact, and that the journey to the hospital by ambulance took only an extra 37 minutes relative to the helicopter, without any adverse effects on Bianchi's condition.|$|E
5|$|Able {{to attack}} the HEIC ships individually, Caroline pulled {{alongside}} Europe at 06:30 and began a heavy fire into the merchant ship, which intermittently replied with her available guns. Within 30 minutes, Europes rigging was tattered, many of her guns dismounted {{and a number of}} her crew wounded or killed. Moving past his now disabled opponent, FÃ©retier next attacked Streatham, which <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> in an unsuccessful attempt to support Europe. Now alone against the frigate, Streatham came under heavy fire at 07:00 and by 08:00 was badly damaged, with casualties in her crew, her guns all dismounted and her lascars hiding below decks. With further resistance hopeless, Dale hauled down the company flag and surrendered.|$|E
5|$|However, Red Army {{resistance}} <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> the Wehrmacht. When, on 10 October the Germans arrived {{within sight}} of the Mozhaisk line west of Moscow, they encountered another defensive barrier manned by new Soviet forces. That same day, Georgy Zhukov, who had been recalled from the Leningrad Front on 6 October, took charge of Moscow's defense and the combined Western and Reserve Fronts, with Colonel General Ivan Konev as his deputy. On 12 October, he ordered the concentration of all available forces on a strengthened Mozhaisk line, a move supported by Vasilevsky. The Luftwaffe still controlled the sky wherever it appeared, and Stuka and bomber groups flew 537 sorties, destroying some 440 vehicles and 150 artillery pieces.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Richard {{attempted}} a comeback with the Astros, but this failed because the stroke <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> down his reaction time and weakened his depth perception. He {{spent the next}} few seasons {{in the minor leagues}} before being released by the Astros in 1984. After his professional baseball career ended, Richard became involved in unsuccessful business deals and went through two divorces, which led to him being homeless and destitute in 1994. Richard found succor in a local church and later became a Christian minister.|$|E
5|$|Once Tamar {{succeeded in}} {{consolidating}} her power {{and found a}} reliable support in David Soslan, the Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli, Toreli, and other noble families, she revived the expansionist foreign policy of her predecessors. Repeated occasions of dynastic strife in Georgia combined with the efforts of regional successors of the Great Seljuq Empire, such as the Ildenizid atabegs of Azerbaijan, Shirvanshahs, and the Ahlatshahs, <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> down the dynamic of the Georgians achieved during the reigns of Tamar's great-grandfather, David IV, and her father, George III. However, the Georgians became again active under Tamar, more prominently in the second decade of her rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{collective}} leadership {{first set}} out to stabilize the Soviet Union and calm Soviet society, a task which {{they were able to}} accomplish. In addition, they attempted to speed up economic growth, which <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> considerably during Khrushchev's last years as ruler. In 1965, Kosygin initiated several reforms to decentralize the Soviet economy. After initial success in creating economic growth, hard-liners within the Party halted the reforms, fearing that they would weaken the Party's prestige and power. No other radical economic reforms were carried out during the Brezhnev era, and economic growth began to stagnate in the early-to-mid-1970s. By Brezhnev's death in 1982, Soviet economic growth had, according to several historians, nearly come to a standstill.|$|E

5|$|The {{failures}} of these titles were further compounded by Atari's business dealings from 1981. Confident in strong sales, {{the company had}} told its distributors to place their 1982 orders all at once. However, video game sales in 1982 <b>had</b> <b>slowed,</b> and distributors who had ordered en masse in expectation of high turnover were left to simply return large quantities of unsold stock to Atari. As a result, the company soon found itself in possession of several million essentially useless video game cartridges, which it would be entirely unable to sell.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the BK Broiler {{was one of the}} most successful product launches in the restaurant industry at the time, encouraging the company look into introducing additional products that would match the success of the Broiler. Furthermore, the success of the product was credited by analysts from Shearson Lehman Hutton Securities as one of the main factors helping Burger King realize a 47% increase in profit margin over the same period in 1989. By 1992, sales of the BK Broiler <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> to half of what they were at the height of its introduction.|$|E
5|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between {{the growth rate of}} newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates for males and females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, Trait du Nord {{horses were}} among those confiscated by Germans from Belgium and France {{for use in the}} war. In 1919, these horses were {{returned}} to their homeland, allowing the reconstruction of the breed. During World War II, the armed forces used all stocks of fuel, and the draft horse was used to continue agricultural production in France. After the war, farmers quickly equipped themselves with mechanized equipment. The decline in the breeding of the Trait du Nord became noticeable in the early 1950s, and by 1960 breed numbers had collapsed completely. By the early 1970s, breeding <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> so much that the Trait du Nord, along with other French draft breeds, was in danger of extinction.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, the Western Allies {{agreed to}} open a second front (the Western Front) in Western Europe to take {{pressure}} off the beleaguered Red Army in the Soviet Union. While Britain and the United States did not yet possess the resources to mount a full invasion, invasion plans {{that came to be}} known as Operation Sledgehammer were drawn up, in case the German position in Western Europe weakened or the USSR's situation became dire. In August 1942 Anglo-Canadian forces attempted an abortive landingâOperation Jubileeâat the French port of Dieppe; the landing was designed to test the feasibility of a cross-channel invasion. The attack was poorly planned and ended in disaster; 4,963 soldiers were killed, wounded or captured. Following the Anglo-American victory against Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in North Africa in May 1943, British, American and Canadian troops invaded Sicily in July 1943, followed by Italy in September. By December the Allies' progress <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> facing tenacious German resistance and the difficult geography of the Italian Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Mansfield was in Biloxi, Mississippi, for an {{engagement}} at the Gus Stevens Supper Club. After two appearances {{the evening of}} June 28, Mansfield, Sam Brody (her attorney and companion), their driver Ronnie Harrison (age 20), and three of Mansfield's childrenâ MiklÃ³s, ZoltÃ¡n and Mariskaâ departed Biloxi after midnight in a 1966 Buick Electra 225. Their destination was New Orleans, where Mansfield was scheduled to appear on WDSU's Midday Show at noon the next day. At approximately 2:25a.m., on U.S. Highway 90 west of the Rigolets Bridge, the Buick crashed at high speed into the rear of a tractor-trailer that <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> behind a truck spraying mosquito fogger and that was shrouded in the insecticide fog. The three adults {{in the front seat}} were killed instantly. The children, who were asleep in the rear seat, survived with minor injuries.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the storm}} was {{tracking}} towards the northwest, between another low pressure system to its west and a low- to mid-level ridge to its east. Throughout the day, thunderstorm activity remained unstable, possibly {{as a result of}} cooler waters churned up by previous storms. In addition, mid- to upper-level dry air had become entrained into the circulation, and the storm contained some subtropical characteristics with a baroclinic-type cloud pattern. By early September 29, Isaac <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> and turned towards the west. Convection began to intensify and consolidate later that day; outflow had also improved, and became more symmetric in nature. Moving into warmer waters, Isaac continued to strengthen, and attained hurricane status on September 30. However, this period of intensification was short-lived, and the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 85mph (140km/h) at around 0000 UTC on October 1. Around that time, a ragged eye feature appeared on satellite imagery.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day, Morris fell at 1/73 and Bradman {{came in to}} join Barnes. Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. He packed the leg side with fielders and ordered Alec Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. While Jim Laker stopped the scoring at the other end, Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes. The Australian captain regarded Bedser as the finest seam bowler he faced in his career, and he batted in a circumspect manner as he sought to establish himself. At the other end, Bradman misjudged a ball from Laker and an incorrectly executed cut shot narrowly went wide of the slip fielder. Now aged 40, Bradman's reflexes <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> and he no longer started his innings as confidently {{as he had done}} in the past.|$|E
5|$|The tournaments {{follow the}} rules used by the IIHF. At the 1969 IIHF Congress, {{officials}} voted to allow body-checking in all three zones in a rink similar to the NHL. Before that, body-checking was only allowed in the defending zone in international hockey. Several other rule changes were implemented in the early 1970s: players were required to wear helmets starting in 1970, and goaltender masks became mandatory in 1972. In 1992, the IIHF switched to using a playoff system to determine medalists and decided that tie games in the medal round would be decided in a shootout. In 1998, the IIHF passed a rule that allowed two-line passes. Before then, the neutral zone trap <b>had</b> <b>slowed</b> the game down and reduced scoring.|$|E
