Although, during the Duvalier administration in Haiti, the country undergone a color change to its <b>flag,</b> <b>swapping</b> out the blue for black and it reflected in its 1974 World Cup kit and federation crest.|$|R

5000|$|Malaysia {{succeeded in}} {{making it to the}} final anyway, after {{overturning}} a 2-1 semi-final first leg deficit to win 5-3 on aggregate against Vietnam in the second leg. Safee was rested for the second leg, reportedly due to injury. Following the victory over Vietnam, he posted an Instagram photo of himself celebrating, with the caption (translated): [...] "To the fans who <b>swapped</b> <b>flags</b> after being told off last time, don't hide your faces behind pillows ok..just wipe them with tissues". One of the photo's hashtags said [...] "#amikkau", which means [...] "take that" [...] in Malay. This outraged Malaysian fans further, and Safee was booed by home supporters during the final game against Thailand.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} a hierarchical CAM architecture for fast VPI/VCI translation, {{taking into account}} the temporal correlation among incoming ATM cells. To dynamically control the order of memory access, caches are integrated into the CAM to sort the addresses of memory array. In this way, power-hungry operations involving actual data swapping are avoided. Four cache memory updating/sorting policies have also been proposed: adjacency and exponential swapping with or without delayed flags. In total, four 32 Kb CAM engines with different cache options have been synthesized and examined. Simulation results show that exponential swapping tends to substantially reduce the number of searches, leading to much lower search time and power consumption. Furthermore, performance of the cache policies can be considerably improved by integrating a delayed <b>swapping</b> <b>flag</b> into the cache...|$|R
50|$|Following the {{traditional}} three pace laps, Phoenix Racing's Kurt Busch {{dropped to the}} rear of the grid due to changing to a backup car after crashing in qualifying. Richard Petty Motorsports teammates Almirola and Ambrose led the 43-car field to the green <b>flag,</b> the teammates <b>swapped</b> the lead for the first 8 laps until Roush Fenway Racing's Biffle assumed the top position on lap 9 from Ambrose. While Ambrose retook the lead from Biffle on lap 15, Almirola steadily fell back to 5th place. By lap 23, Biffle retook the lead from Ambrose and moved out to a 1-second lead. On lap 41, Allmendinger was the first driver to pit in a series of green-flag pit stops. Biffle made his stop along with Johnson on lap 47 and was able to hold the lead after pit stops were completed.|$|R
