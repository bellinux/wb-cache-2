[...] "Tell your mother all you have told me--and more, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> to say. She is better {{prepared}} for you than I was. We will take to-day to think of it, Magdalen; and to-morrow you shall know, and Frank shall know, what we decide." ...|$|E

"What I {{have told}} you," [...] the latter continued, {{after a few}} moments' pause, [...] "must not, during these days, pass beyond the four walls of this {{singularly}} uninviting-looking apartment. I have nothing to add or to take from what I have said. The subject is closed. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> questions on any other subject, I have still a few minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That doesn't {{matter a}} bit. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more,</b> why, {{the more the}} merrier. If you have less, {{or if you have}} to give up all your {{property}} when you're married, I will soon make another ten thousand to supply the loss. Only give me one good word, and, by George, I'll fight the seven champions of Christendom, one down and t'other come on, for five thousand a side each. Hang the money!" ...|$|E

But I think, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> nothing <b>more</b> {{to say to me}} I will be stepping. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> nothing <b>more</b> to say?"

"No, only ten, {{but that}} was pretty well for a fourteen-year-old dressmaker. <b>You</b> ought to <b>have</b> seen the little witch laugh in her sleeve when any one admired the dress, for she wore it all summer and looked as pretty as a pink in it. Such things are great fun when {{you get used to}} them; besides, contriving sharpens your wits, and makes <b>you</b> feel as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> hands than most people." ...|$|R

"Bon," [...] {{repeated}} Raoul, feeling {{no wish to}} hear a thrice-told tale {{gone through}} again, Bunker Hill invariably placing Ithuel on a great horse {{in the way of}} bragging; for he not only imagined that great victory a New England triumph, as in fact it was, but he was much disposed to encourage the opinion that it was in a great measure [...] "granite."

I have here mine own old {{breastplate}} and head-piece, which should, methinks, fit you, for <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> flesh than I, I am a larger framework of a man. Ah, said I not so! Were't measured for you by Silas Thomson, the court armourer, it could not grip better. Now on with the head-piece. A close fit again. You are now a cavalier whom Monmouth or any other leader might be proud to see ride beneath his banner.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... § XXXV. Finally, {{as regards}} {{quantity}} of ornament I have already said, again and again, you cannot {{have too much}} if it be good; that is, if it be thoroughly united and harmonised by the laws hitherto insisted upon. But you may easily have too much <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> than you have sense to manage. For with every added order of ornament increases the difficulty of discipline. It {{is exactly the same}} as in war: you cannot, as an abstract law, have too many soldiers, but you may easily have more than the country is able to sustain, or than your generalship is competent to command. And every regiment which you cannot manage will, on the day of battle, be in your way, and encumber the movements it is not in disposition to sustain.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "rule of odds" [...] {{suggests}} that an odd {{number of subjects}} in an image is more interesting than an even number. Thus <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> than one subject in your picture, the suggestion is to choose an arrangement with at least three subjects. An even number of subjects produces symmetries in the image, which can appear less natural for a naturalistic, informal composition.|$|E

5000|$|Players {{start with}} a small amount of money and in the {{outermost}} ring. On each turn, the player rolls two dice and moves that many spaces in a clockwise direction around the board. If a player should have a job, they can move through that space to the second ring; subsequently, if the player should have a housing space, they can use that space to move through to the innermost ring. Each time around the board (indicated by the [...] "Pay Day" [...] space), the players earn money from their jobs, minus the cost of their rent (it is possible to have to pay the bank <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> rent than job income); players without jobs get a small stipend from [...] "their parents". The goal of the game is to progress around the innermost ring 4 times to succeed at 'getting out' of [...] "the parents' basement".|$|E
5000|$|The {{mathematical}} {{basis with}} respect to the association entropy has with order and disorder began, essentially, with the famous Boltzmann formula, , which relates entropy S to the number of possible states W in which a system can be found. [...] As an example, consider a box that is divided into two sections. What is the probability that a certain number, or all of the particles, will be found in one section versus the other when the particles are randomly allocated to different places within the box? If you only have one particle, then that system of one particle can subsist in two states, one side of the box versus the other. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> than one particle, or define states as being further locational subdivisions of the box, the entropy is lower because the number of states is greater. The relationship between entropy, order, and disorder in the Boltzmann equation is so clear among physicists that according to the views of thermodynamic ecologists Sven Jorgensen and Yuri Svirezhev, “it is obvious that entropy is a measure of order or, most likely, disorder in the system.” [...] In this direction, the second law of thermodynamics, as famously enunciated by Rudolf Clausius in 1865, states that: ...|$|E
