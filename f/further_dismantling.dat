It specifically addresses questions such as: Are the impediments to exports mainly internal and demand related, or are they associated more with the conditions of supply?

This paper theorises think tanks as hybrid, boundary spanning organisations that work across academic, media, political and economic fields. An argument is proffered that it is the restructured state, with its loss of research capacity and fast policy making, which has strengthened opportunities for think tank influence across the policy cycle in education.

40|$|A new {{institutional}} reform {{is one of}} the major stakes for the Belgian citizens and enterprises ahead of the regional election of June 2009. Since the general federal election of June 2007 Belgium has been facing new tensions between the two main Communities. On one side, the Flemish Community has been claiming a "great" {{institutional reform}} that would significantly enlarge the competences and fiscal capacity of Regions and Communities. On the other the French-speaking Community is reluctant, fearing that this could <b>further</b> <b>dismantle</b> the federal State and reduce solidarity. The Flemish position was first made official in the Resolutions of the Flemish Parliament of March 1999. They ask the transfer to Regions or Communities of employment policy, including unemployment benefits, health care and family benefits. These new policies would be funded, at decentralised level, by the transfer to Regions or Communities of the income tax, part of the VAT and of the corporation tax, and by the creation of two or three regional or community systems of social security contributions. In this paper the Flemish claims are evaluated in the frame of the so-called "magic square" :autonomy - responsibility - solidarity - tax competition. It is argued that the present-day institutional structure fits the theory of fiscal federalism rather well. Further decentralisation would increase autonomy and responsibility and could create, as the Flemish Community claims, more homogeneous sets of competencies. However it would also affect solidarity and tax competition, and increase drastically the complexity of tax and social legislations and thus increase the administrative burden for multiregional enterprise © De Boeck Université.

40|$|The gastric {{digestion}} comprises three phases: physical disintegration, chemical breakdown and nutrient release. Controlling food proteins gelation conditions {{leads to the}} formation of particles with specific structural features that change protein digestibility. The development of foods with specific proteolysis rates allows their fit to different ‘nutritional vulnerable groups’ (newborn,elderly, obese, athletes) needs. The hypothesis is that the overall proteolysis reaction rate is limited by the pepsin diffusion rate within the protein structures generated in the stomach. Three milk gels with the same protein concentration but different microstructures were preparedeither by rennet, acid coagulation of non-fat milk, or heat treatment of whey proteins. The disintegration of the different gel networks was investigated under digestion in simulated gastric conditions, and the effect of the acidic environment uncoupled from the enzyme effect. The first effect was monitored during 30 minutes before addition of pepsin for two hours of digestion. Kinetics of the process was surveilled by particle size measurements and matter loss. Proteolysis was characterized by SDS-PAGE, and diffusion of fluorescently labelled (FITC) pepsin within the gels was followed using fluorescent recovery after photobleaching withconfocal microscopy. In contrast to acid and whey protein gels, rennet gels underwent large microstructuralmodifications under acidic conditions, forming extremely compact protein aggregates that significantly slowed down pepsin diffusion rates through the modified gel network. Microscopic observations showed slower morphological evolution during the enzymatic digestion, whose rates depended on the gel considered. Moreover, pepsin was able to diffuse within the aggregates. Recent microscopic observations obtained by tryptophan fluorescence imaging on the SOLEIL synchrotron DISCO beamline suggest that the particles were enzyme digested inside out. In this study, we succeeded in interpret the digestion phases as microstructural transformation,enzymatic reaction and diffusion phenomena in order to <b>further</b> <b>dismantle</b> the digestion processfrom a process engineering perspective...|$|R

The answer is not yet clear. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is generally considered the treatment of choice, disordered eating has been shown to persist and re-emerge following CBT. Furthermore, little research exists regarding treatment efficacy for eating disorder presentations that fall outside of the current diagnoses of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. The current study bolsters this area by examining the efficacy of two brief treatments based on dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) for binge eating, be {{it in the context of}} full- or sub-threshold BN or full or sub-threshold BED. Participants were randomly assigned to either group DBT with coaching calls (DBT) or diary card self-monitoring with brief individual sessions (DC). Fifteen treatment sessions were provided over 16 weeks. Both treatments were associated with significant change (in the desired direction) in bulimic symptoms, dichotomous thinking, food labeling, drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, ineffectiveness, perfectionism, and interpersonal distrust over the course of treatment. While DBT outperformed DC on symptom measures, DC outperformed DBT on retention. The results point to possibilities for stepped care and avenues for future research, including replication with a larger sample, <b>further</b> <b>dismantling</b> (e. g., DBT vs. behavior chain analysis; DBT vs. mindful eating), and comparison with other available treatments (e. g., treatment as usual; CBT; IPT) ...|$|E
40|$|Having {{discussed}} {{issues of}} economic reform and its applications on the Indonesian economy followed by Indonesian SAMs and CGE applications, three CGE models representative to the economy were developed by using SAMs of 1985, 1990 and 1993 for analysing the effects {{of economic reform}}. Production is specified as a two-level nesting of CES functions and total production is allocated to domestic demand and exports. Producers {{are assumed to be}} indifferent between selling domestically and exporting, while for imports the `small country' assumption is adopted. Total demands are derived from composite commodities of domestically produced and imported commodities. Fixed and planned consumption patterns are assumed for households and government, which makes government saving a residual. Aggregate investment is accordingly fixed, reflecting the 'investment driven' nature of the economy. Three policy changes (i. e. stabilisation, trade liberalisation and tax reform) are then simulated as well as sequencing simulations, in which the three policy changes are simulated in different orders. Stabilisation simulation results suggest that government spending cut will make contractions, leading to worsening welfare status. This policy, however, has favourable impacts on income distribution, since government consumption has increasingly been favouring higher income households. Trade liberalisation increases trades and availability of products. This in turn improves macroeconomic performance and welfare condition. Trade balance and government deficit, however, worsen. This policy also has favourable impacts on income distribution of rural households since urban households seem to be the ones benefiting from the existing tariff protection. Indirect tax reductions improve macroeconomic performances, welfare condition and income distribution, especially among agriculture households. Government bears the adverse effects due to its consumption behaviour and initial budget deficits. The sequencing simulations show that initial condition is crucial which affects choices of favourable policies. A sensible choice for sequencing of economic reform in Indonesia is to start with tax reform, which can then be followed by, trade liberalisation and stabilisation. By having less distorted domestic market, the benefits from trade and other reform policies can be more realised. If a deficit reduction is a matter of urgency, stabilisation should include other policies that reduce existing distortions. The same is also applied for trade liberalisation. There seems an urgent need to <b>further</b> <b>dismantling</b> the existing distortions in the domestic market, indicating that the actual government policies adopted during, the period concerned were 'not the best ones...|$|E
40|$|Globalization is {{triggering}} {{an increase}} in the establishment of alien insects in Europe, with several species having substantial ecological and economic impacts. We investigated long-term changes in rates of species spread following establishment. We used the total area of countries invaded by 1171 insect species for which the date of first record in Europe is known, to estimate their current range radius (calculated as [invaded area] /π). We estimated initial rates of radial spread and compared them among different groups of insects for all years (1800 – 2014) and for a subset of more recent decades (1950 – 2014). Accidentally introduced species spread faster than intentionally introduced species. Considering the whole period 1800 – 2014, spread patterns also differ between feeding guilds, with decreasing spread rates over residence time in herbivores but not in detritivores or parasitic species. These decreases for herbivorous species appeared mainly in those associated with herbaceous plants and crops rather than woody plants. Initial spread rate was significantly greater for species detected after 1990, roughly 3 – 4 times higher than for species that arrived earlier. We hypothesize that the political changes in Europe following the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 1989, and the <b>further</b> <b>dismantling</b> of customs checkpoints within an enlarged European Union (EU) have facilitated the faster spread of alien insect species. Also, the number of species first recorded in the Eastern Bloc of the politically-divided Europe before 1989 was lower than for the rest of Europe. A detailed analysis of six recent invaders indicated a dominant role of long-distance translocations related to human activities, especially with the plant trade, in determining rates of spread. This paper had its origin at a workshop on “Drivers, impacts, mechanisms and adaptation in insect invasions” hosted and co-funded by the DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion in Stellenbosch, South Africa, in November 2014.

50|$|In {{the course}} of instituting {{government}} policy, Stalin promoted the doctrine of Socialism in One Country (adopted 1925), wherein the USSR would establish socialism upon Russia's economic foundations (and support socialist revolutions elsewhere). Conversely, Trotsky held that socialism in one country would economically constrain the industrial development of the USSR, and thus required assistance from the new socialist countries that had arisen in the developed world, which was essential for maintaining Soviet democracy, in 1924 much undermined by civil war and counter-revolution. Furthermore, Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution proposed that socialist revolutions in underdeveloped countries would go <b>further</b> towards <b>dismantling</b> feudal régimes, and establish socialist democracies that would not pass through a capitalist stage of development and government. Hence, revolutionary workers should politically ally with peasant political organisations, but not with capitalist political parties. In contrast, Stalin and allies proposed that alliances with capitalist political parties were essential to realising a revolution where Communists were too few; said Stalinist practice failed, especially in the Northern Expedition portion of the Chinese Revolution (1925-1927), wherein it resulted in the right-wing Kuomintang's massacre of the Chinese Communist Party; nonetheless, despite the failure, Stalin's policy of mixed-ideology political alliances, became Comintern policy.|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} and increasing rate of urbanisation is causing many researchers to look deeper at life in cities. Increasingly recognised are {{the benefits of}} urban green space and their associated recreational parks and nature reserves. While {{there is a growing}} literature on the environmental services provided by these areas; so too is there a growing literature on the numerous social benefits that recreational green spaces in particular afford their users. Although imagined and generally designed as salubrious public spaces, many parks often fall short of this. In fact research has shown that a park's design, its surroundings, and its management can all combine to exclude certain types of people. In this study I conducted ethnographic research to participate in and observe the activities of visitors to False Bay Nature Reserve in Cape Town. False Bay Nature Reserve includes a series of nature reserves and the Cape Flats Waste Water Treatment Works, and is situated in the area of Cape Town known as the Cape Flats. Much of the Cape Flats is beset by poverty, unemployment, and violent drug - related crime carried out by notorious gangs. Despite the challenges of the surrounding areas, my study reveals that False Bay Nature Reserve provides relative safety to its users as well a range of enjoyable re creational activities. Some of the key recreational activities are separated distinctively between two key sites in the reserve. Furthermore the visitors of these sites differ markedly in race, ethnicity and income. The legacy of apartheid almost certainly accounts for much of this separation; however, the study indicates that the barriers of this legacy are eroding and can potentially be <b>further</b> <b>dismantled</b> with engaged and informed management strategies. Due to its surroundings, the reserve is vulnerable and recently experienced a period where crime was prevalent, vegetation was overgrown, and it was feared by many of its users, particularly women. The reserve had in many ways become what researchers call a landscape of fear, a not so uncommon description of parks around the world. However, management and the majority of visitors feel the reserve has recovered from this period. This is in large part due to upgrades that improved recreational facilities and security in the reserve. Accounts from visitors high light how important a sense of safety is for people frequenting this reserve, most of who live in nearby neighbourhoods. The reserve still faces some challenges today, but is a significant asset to the City of Cape Town and many of its more marginalised residents. This study challenges much of the literature on the benefits of urban green space and associated parks. It shows that particularly in cities of the Global South such as Cape Town, parks require specific management strategies that prioritise safety and in doing so promote and ensure inclusivity for all...|$|R
