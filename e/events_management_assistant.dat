In order for Australia to position itself as a world leader in <b>event</b> <b>management,</b> {{it is important to}} provide consistent high professional standards and event managers that not only meet, but exceed the demands of the industry. While there is some literature that focuses on the tourism and leisure job market (Crossley, 1992; Keung & Pine, 2000), and a small but developing literature base that focuses on <b>event</b> <b>management</b> training (Harris & Jago, 1999; Hawkins & Goldbatt, 1995) relatively little consideration has been given to a national agenda for <b>event</b> <b>management</b> skilling. To provide an indication of current employer requirements, a nationwide study of job advertisements in <b>event</b> <b>management</b> has commenced. The aims of the study are to further the understanding of the educational needs and training requirements of the industry; to ascertain the learned skills and personal attributes sought from event managers; to determine the compatibility of industry demands with current educational and vocational provisions; and to suggest post-secondary institutional avenues through which <b>event</b> <b>management</b> education and training needs can be pursued. This is an ongoing study and it is hoped that it will contribute towards a broad scale understanding of the <b>event</b> <b>management</b> job market.

40|$|M. Tech. Sport {{has become}} the {{broadest}} common cultural denominator in almost all societies (Lapchick, cited in Gouws, 1997). As a result, sporting events have become an increasingly popular means for achieving political, cultural and economic benefits for the host nation (Parent, 2008). Consequently, {{this has led to}} an increased demand in the value of diverse skills in the sport <b>event</b> <b>management</b> field. This is to cope with the increased complexities surrounding sport <b>event</b> <b>management</b> and thus requires a distinct body of knowledge and skills to be developed (Quatman, 2008). However, concern over the lack of a relevant base of common knowledge (NASPE-NASSM, 1993) as well as pertinent training programmes to prepare sport managers for the contemporary sport events industry has resulted in current graduates not necessarily meeting the needs or expectations of the industry. As a result, {{there appears to be a}} gap between the current <b>event</b> <b>management</b> curricula outcomes at higher education institutions (HEIs) in South Africa and the expected competencies of sport event managers in practice. The aim is therefore to develop guidelines for sport <b>event</b> <b>management</b> training in higher education institutions on various HEQF levels (DoL, 2008) to address the competencies required by managers for the South African context. This translates into objectives, namely: i) to identify, conceptualise and unpack sport <b>event</b> <b>management</b> competencies required by sport event managers, ii) to investigate the curricula of sport <b>event</b> <b>management</b> at higher education institutions in South Africa, iii) to investigate the importance of different competencies required by sport event managers in South Africa, iv) to investigate the current level of competencies of practitioners regarding sport <b>event</b> <b>management</b> in South Africa, v) to provide a background on the current education system in South Africa and vi) provide guidelines for sport <b>event</b> <b>management</b> training in higher education institutions at various HEQF levels (DoL, 2008) to address the competencies required by managers for the South African context.
