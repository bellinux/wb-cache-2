5|$|Two 20th century {{developments}} in geology <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> effect on paleontology. The {{first was the}} development of radiometric dating, which allowed absolute dates to be assigned to the geologic timescale. The second was the theory of plate tectonics, which helped {{make sense of the}} geographical distribution of ancient life.|$|E

He was a good person and definitely deserves to be remembered.|$|E

50|$|Research has {{consistently}} shown that, {{as far as}} birth complications are concerned, the care provider’s perception that <b>a</b> baby is <b>big</b> is more harmful than <b>an</b> actual <b>big</b> baby by itself. In a 2008 study, researchers compared what happened to women who were suspected of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> baby to what happened to women who were not suspected of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> baby—but who ended up having one. In the end, women who were suspected of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> baby (and actually <b>had</b> one) <b>had</b> <b>a</b> triple in the induction rate, more than triple the C-section rate, and a quadrupling of the maternal complication rate, compared to women who were not suspected of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> baby but who had one anyway.|$|R

5|$|On defense, the Hokies {{were led}} by linebacker Vince Hall, who {{recorded}} seven solo tackles, one assisted tackle, and one pass break-up. Hokies' defender Orion Martin also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> game, recording six solo tackles, one assisted tackle, and twosacks of Kansas quarterback Todd Reesing. Two other defensive players recorded one sack apiece, and D.J. Parker recorded the Hokies' sole interception on defense.|$|E
5|$|Fisheries {{also have}} {{negative}} effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, {{are a source of}} increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.|$|E

5|$|At the beginning, Lasker {{tried to}} attack but Schlechter had no {{difficulty}} defending, {{so that the}} first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> advantage, but committed a blunder that cost him the game. Hence at {{the middle of the}} match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed to draw a game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because of a beautiful exchange sacrifice from Schlechter. In the ninth only a blunder from Lasker allowed Schlechter to draw a lost ending. The score before the last game was thus 5–4 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and took a big advantage, but he missed a clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished by losing. Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.|$|E
5|$|The {{company that}} {{produced}} Another World, Delphine Software, has since gone into administrative receivership and Another World remains their most recognized game. Paul Cuisset's best-selling 1992 game Flashback, also released by Delphine but created without any involvement from Chahi, features similar gameplay and graphics {{and makes a}} few nods to Another World, {{including the use of}} personal force fields in combat, a nearly identical end text in the ending cutscene, and an almost exact motion recreation of the gun pickup cutscene. A very similar plot premise was used in 1999's Outcast by Infogrames Entertainment, too from France. The game also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> influence on several other game designers, especially in Japan. Fumito Ueda cited Another World as an inspiration for his creation of Ico. Hideo Kojima, creator of the Metal Gear series, said {{it was one of the}} five games that influenced him the most. Video game designer Goichi Suda called it his favourite game.|$|E
