They were {{extremely}} prominent, and observers described them as even more easily visible than the Great Red Spot. A search of historical observations revealed that the spots were probably the most prominent transient features <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> the planet, and that although the Great Red Spot is notable for its striking color, no spots of the size and darkness of those caused by the SL9 impacts have ever been recorded before.|$|E

25|$|The five active {{chimneys}} of Loki's Castle are venting {{water as}} hot as 300 °C (570 °F) and sit on a vast mound of sulfide minerals which is about 825ft (250 m) in diameter at its base, and some 300 feet (90 m) across its top. A member of the 2008 expedition, oceanographer Marvin Lilley has speculated {{that this may be}} the largest such deposit <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> the sea floor. The active chimneys are mostly black in colour, but are covered with mats of white bacteria which are living on minerals and materials emitted by the vents. The older chimneys are a mottled red colour, due to the presence of deposits of oxidised iron.|$|E
25|$|The first multi-team testing session {{took place}} at Circuit de Catalunya, Barcelona in November 2008, {{two weeks after the}} end of {{previous}} season. All teams, except Toyota, took part in the testing session where some teams tested their new aerodynamics package and slick tyres. The new look cars did not suit everyone's taste, with BMW Sauber's test driver, Christian Klien, labelling the car the ugliest car he'd <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>On</b> 9 March, testing at Barcelona featured for the first time Brawn GP, who made an immediate impact by leading the times early in the day. The test, the first in which all teams used their 2009 cars, had BMW Sauber leading the times while Brawn GP finished fourth. On day three, Brawn GP's Jenson Button was fastest by just over one second to Ferrari's Felipe Massa, while Button's teammate Rubens Barrichello went even faster the next day. At {{the other end of the}} timing sheets, reigning Champion Lewis Hamilton's McLaren team were struggling to adapt to the new regulations, often 1.5 seconds off the pace. Massa stated he had never seen McLaren so far behind.|$|E
500|$|Although the season's {{plan was}} changed very little, Thomas said that Logan became {{a much bigger}} {{character}} than anticipated. Thomas attributed this to Jason Dohring being an engaging performer, and the crew wanting to write scenes for him. While the budget for each episode was around $1.7 million, an extra $400,000 was spent for the finale. Filming was extended by one full day with the first unit and an extra three days of filming with the second unit.

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Squeeze" [...] was rated B+; it was called [...] "an important episode", and Hutchison's portrayal of Tooms was described as [...] "profoundly creepy". However, Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent was more critical, deriding the premise as [...] "entirely ludicrous", and sarcastically described Mulder's deduction of Tooms' abilities as [...] "clearly another triumph for the deductive method". An article in the Vancouver Sun listed [...] "Squeeze" [...] {{as one of the}} best stand-alone episodes of the show, saying, [...] "The X-Files became known for its creepy, monster-of-the-week episodes, and Squeeze was the one that started it all", and that, together with [...] "Tooms", it [...] "remains one of the scariest things <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> television".

500|$|Andrew Billen of The Times however, {{felt the}} finale was [...] "not [...] very {{exciting}} episode," [...] and [...] "conducted {{with a minimum}} of acting." [...] Mof Gimmers of TV Scoop praised the episode, saying [...] "Neil Cross {{knows a thing or two}} about ratcheting up the tension, and in the finale of the seventh series of Spooks he used both of them.

[...] Gimmers called the chase sequence in the episode [...] "one of the most thrilling traditional chase sequences <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> British TV," [...] the interplay between the characters [...] "was handled expertly," [...] and ended with [...] "already I can't wait for the next series!" ...|$|E

Alison Darren in her Lesbian Film Guide is also positive, asserting that: [...] "Great Moments in Aviation is a little gem of a British film". She describes the resolution of the lesbian storyline as [...] "a golden scene, beautifully photographed and exceptionally well paced", and asserts that [...] "For women of a certain age, this may be the most heart-rending (not to say, inspirational) depiction of a coming-out moment <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> screen.

500|$|Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser of Dragon {{praised the}} designers' {{attention}} to detail, and cited the game's humor {{as a high}} point. Although {{they believed that the}} game was too expensive, they summarized it as [...] "a highly enjoyable graphic adventure replete with interesting puzzles, a fantastic Roland soundtrack, superb VGA graphics, smooth-scrolling animation, and some of the funniest lines <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> your computer screen." [...] Duncan MacDonald of Zero praised the graphics and found the game [...] "quite amusing". His favorite aspect was the fine-tuned difficulty level, which he believed was [...] "just right". He ended his review, [...] "At last an adventure game that's enjoyable rather than frustrating." [...] Paul Glancey of Computer and Video Games consider the game superior to Lucasfilm's earlier adventure titles, and wrote that, [...] "Usually the entertainment you get from an adventure is derived solely from solving puzzles, but the hilarious characters and situations, and the movie-like presentation ... make playing this more like taking part in a comedy film, so it's much more enjoyable." [...] He considered the puzzles to be [...] "brilliantly conceived" [...] and found the game's controls accessible. He summarized it as [...] "utterly enthralling".|$|E
500|$|Opinions on the game's visual style varied. Walton {{called the}} game's visuals [...] "some {{of the best}} <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> the Wii", which was echoed to a degree by MacDonald. Castle was {{generally}} positive about the game's aesthetics, citing the water effects as particularly good. Edge was fairly mixed, saying that well-done environmental effects or the world-building through character banter were spoiled by low-quality textures and stilted character animations. Juba praised the character models, but found environments to be [...] "ugly and muddy in comparison"; Fuller, while not actively criticizing them, said that players used to high-definition consoles would be disappointed. GameTrailers found the amount of detail put into environments [...] "remarkable" [...] for the Wii hardware {{despite a lack of}} scale, while Parkin found the visuals generally unimpressive despite a few stand-out moments. Nintendo Power said that the graphics gave the game's setting an [...] "authentic" [...] appearance despite some low-resolution textures, while Eurogamer praised them for their [...] "sepia tone". Frame rate drops during moments of high activity were generally noted by reviewers. Uematsu's incidental scoring also received praise from multiple critics.|$|E
500|$|Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called Jerry's {{presentation}} [...] "one of {{the most}} amazing scenes in Parks & Rec history". Heisler also praised Pratt's performance and felt Ann was unusually sympathetic in [...] "Park Safety", but felt Samberg was poorly used and his loud talking quickly grew tiresome. New York magazine writer Steve Kandell said [...] "Park Safety" [...] continued an ongoing development of the mythology of the Pawnee community, comparing it to [...] "a live-action Springfield", the setting of the animated comedy series The Simpsons. Kandell said Samberg's character [...] "could have been irritating but somehow wasn't". Matt Fowler of IGN called Jerry's presentation [...] "one of the best, most pointed moments of crude humor that we've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> the show". Fowler also said Swanson's expertise in self-defense [...] "fits perfectly" [...] to his character. Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said the constant mocking of Jerry made him feel uncomfortable, and that Samberg [...] "just seemed like the personification of an SNL skit instead of a real character". But Gallagher praised Ron Swanson's role in the episode, as well as the apparent rekindling of Ann's feelings for Andy.|$|E

500|$|The Stone Tape remains well-regarded to this day. [...] Roger Fulton, {{writing in}} The Encyclopedia of TV Science Fiction, calls it [...] "arguably the most creepy drama <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> television". The writer and critic Kim Newman regards it as [...] "one of the masterpieces of genre television, an {{authentic}} alliance of mind-stretching science fiction concepts with horror and suspense plot mechanics". Writer {{and member of}} The League of Gentlemen, Jeremy Dyson feels that The Stone Tape [...] "strikes a note that it just circumnavigates your intellect and gets you on a much deeper level [...] it just has this impact on you, rather {{like being in the}} room itself.

Sergio Angelini, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, has said that [...] "The Stone Tape stands as perhaps his finest single work in the genre". Lez Cooke, in his book British Television Drama: A History, has praised the play as [...] "one of the most imaginative and intelligent examples of the horror genre to appear on British television, a single play to rank alongside the best of Play for Today".|$|E
500|$|Legend of Mana {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The game's presentation was almost universally praised, especially {{its use of}} vibrant and colorful hand-drawn graphics. David Smith of IGN claimed that the graphics {{were one of the}} game's best points, and RPGamer's Andrew P. Bilyk noted that the visuals [...] "may be the most impressive two-dimensional graphics ever to grace an RPG". Andrew Pfister of Electronic Gaming Monthly praised them even more, calling them [...] "the most impressive 2D artwork <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> a console". Damian Thomas's RPGFan review likened the graphics to Disney animation for having [...] "a very storybook, cutesy cartoony feel to them", while Andrew Vestal of GameSpot said that the graphics were some of the most lush and ornate 2D graphics ever made. The game won an award for best graphics at the 4th Japan Game Awards from the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association. The music in Legend of Mana was also a high point in many reviews; the reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly called it [...] "fantastic" [...] and [...] "wonderful". Smith of IGN's review stated that the soundtrack is [...] "as good as any you'll hear today" [...] with a good mix of intensity, suspense, and subtle nuance, and Vestal of GameSpot termed it [...] "excellently orchestrated" [...] and a perfect fit for the game in each environment.|$|E
500|$|Super Mario Kart {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} and {{proved to be}} a commercial success; it received a Player's Choice release after selling one million copies and eventually went on to sell nine million copies to become the third best selling game ever for the SNES.

Critics praised the game's Mode 7 graphics; in 1992 Nintendo Magazine System described them as superb and the graphics have since been described as among the best <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>on</b> the SNES. Another aspect of the game to have been praised is its gameplay, which Thunderbolt has described as the [...] "deepest [...] most addictive... to be found on the SNES console". Nintendo Magazine System showed a preference for the multiplayer modes of the game and stated that while the [...] "single player mode becomes dull quickly" [...] the [...] "two-player mode won't lose appeal". Retrospective reviews of the game have been positive with perfect scores given by review sites including Thunderbolt and HonestGamers. The use of the style and characters from the Mario franchise was also praised as well as the individual characteristics of each racer. Mean Machines describes the game as having [...] "struck gold" [...] in a way that no other – not even its sequels – has matched and GameSpot named the game {{as one of the greatest}} games of all time for its innovation, gameplay and visual style.|$|E
