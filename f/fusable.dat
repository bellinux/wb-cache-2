25|$|Dental amalgam {{has had a}} {{long history}} and global impact. It was first {{introduced}} in the Chinese materia medica of Su Kung in 659 A.D. during the Tang Dynasty. In Europe, Johannes Stockerus, a municipal physician in Ulm, Germany, recommended amalgam as a filling material as early as 1528. In 1818, Parisian physician Louis Nicolas Regnart added one-tenth by weight of mercury to the <b>fusable</b> metals used as fillings at the time to create a temporarily soft metal alloy at room temperature. Thus, amalgam (an alloy of mercury with another metal or metals, from the French word amalgame) was invented. This was further perfected in 1826, when Auguste Taveau of Paris used a silver paste made from mixing French silver-tin coins with mercury, which offered more plasticity and a quicker setting time. In Europe, prior to 1818, carious teeth were either filled with a melted metal, usually gold or silver (which would often lead to death of the nerve of the tooth from thermal trauma), or the tooth would be extracted.|$|E
60|$|As {{there is}} no discoverable {{connexion}} between fixedness and the colour, weight, and other simple ideas of that nominal essence of gold; so, if we make our complex idea of gold, a body yellow, <b>fusable,</b> ductile, weighty, and fixed, we shall be at the same uncertainty concerning solubility in AQUA REGIA, and for the same reason. Since we can never, from consideration of the ideas themselves, with certainty affirm or deny of a body whose complex idea {{is made up of}} yellow, very weighty, ductile, fusible, and fixed, that it is soluble in AQUA REGIA: and so on of the rest of its qualities. I would gladly meet with one general affirmation concerning any will, no doubt, be presently objected, Is not this an universal proposition, ALL GOLD IS MALLEABLE? To which I answer, It is a very complex idea the word gold stands for. But then here is nothing affirmed of gold, but that that sound stands for an idea in which malleableness is contained: and such a sort of truth and certainty as this it is, to say a centaur is four-footed. But if malleableness make {{not a part of the}} specific essence the name of gold stands for, it is plain, ALL GOLD IS MALLEABLE, is not a certain proposition. Because, let the complex idea of gold be made up of whichsoever of its other qualities you please, malleableness will not appear to depend on that complex idea, nor follow from any simple one contained in it: the connexion that malleableness has (if it has any) with those other qualities being only by the intervention of the real constitution of its insensible parts; which, since we know not, it is impossible we should perceive that connexion, unless we could discover that which ties them together.|$|E
5000|$|Fulgurites {{are formed}} when {{lightning}} strikes the ground, fusing and vitrifying mineral grains. The peak temperatures within a lightning channel {{are known to}} exceed 30,000 K, with sufficient pressure to produce planar deformation features, or [...] "shock lamellae" [...] in SiO2 polymorphs. [...] "Artificial fulgurites" [...] can also be produced when the controlled arcing of electricity into a <b>fusable</b> medium. Downed high voltage power lines have produced blue, fulgurite-like lechatelierites, colored by copper from the power lines, themselves.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFusion is {{obtained}} between electropermeabilized mammalian cells and intact large unilamellar lipid vesicles. This is monitored by a fluorescence assay. Prepulse contact {{is obtained}} by Ca 2 + when negatively charged lipids {{are present in}} the liposomes. The mixing of the liposome content in the cell cytoplasm is observed under conditions preserving cell viability. Electric conditions are such that free liposomes are not affected by the external field. Therefore destabilization of only one of the two membranes of the partners is sufficient for fusion. The comparison between the efficiency of dye delivery for different liposome preparations (multilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, small unilamellar vesicles) is indicative that more metastable liposomes are more <b>fusable</b> with electropulsated cells. This observation is discussed {{within the framework of the}} recent hypothesis that occurrence of a contact induced electrostatic destabilization of the plasma membrane is a key step in the exocytosis process...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{anatexis}} of sedimentary rocks took place in the dynamothermal aurcoles of some ophiolites, yielding granitic melts which invaded the overlying ophiolite sequences as veins and as granite bodies up to 1 km in maximum dimension. This study of the geological setting, geochemistry and thermal conditions of genesis of the granitic rocks generated during emplacement of three ophiolite complexes, the Semail thrust sheet of Oman, the Guevgueli Complex in northern Greece and the Lizard Complex in southwest Fngland, suggests that: 1) the granites probably represent minimum melts formed by water-saturated melting at about 3 - 5 kb pressure and 650 - 750 'C; 2) the protoliths were probably hemipelagic sediments containing a terrigenous component that rendered them <b>fusable</b> although that component varied in composition between the granites studied; 3) the oceanic lithosphere beneath which these sediments were subducted must have been young (< < 10 Ma) and hence hot at the time of subduction; and 4) high shear stresses or deep subduction are needed to account for the heat required to generate the granite bodies...|$|E

Dense komatiitic liquids and eclogitic solids sank to mid-mantle depths. The large-ion lithophile elements and primordial gases accumulated in the proto-upper mantle. During subsequent evolution, {{most of the}} crustal elements were sweated out of the upper mantle; the layer {{at the base of}} the mantle collected light dross from the core and dense dregs from the mantle and reacted with the core. This fractionation and gravitational sorting of primordial materials according to density, solubility, silicate compatibility, and melting point became irreversible as the planet grew because of the effect of pressure on thermal expansion. Chemical boundaries are hard to detect by seismic techniques, but evidence favors one such boundary near 1000 km. Below this, the mantle is probably depleted in volatiles and the heat-producing elements, and represents the accreted material minus the buoyant and <b>fusable</b> compounds and the accompanying trace elements. Observations also favor a thick, chemically distinct layer {{at the base of the}} mantle that may extend, in places, more than 1000 km from the core-mantle boundary. This layer exhibits large-scale sluggish behavior as appropriate for high Prandtl number, low Rayleigh number convection. This kind of chemical and gravitational stratification resolves various geodynamic and geochemical paradoxes, and is more consistent with petrology and mineral physics than one- and two-layer models, and reversible stratification...|$|E
