5|$|The 11 {{extra points}} against Cumberland by Bart Sims <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> school record. The offense {{was led by}} Diddy Seibels; the defense by Ormond Simkins. John Heisman's Auburn team {{was the only one}} even to score on Sewanee.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{birds in}} Asia can be {{confused}} with the similar lesser whistling duck, although that species is smaller, has a blackish crown and lacks an obvious dark stripe down the back of the neck. Juvenile fulvous whistling ducks are very like young lesser whistling ducks, but the crown colour <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> distinction. Juvenile comb ducks are bulkier than whistling ducks and have a dark cap to the head. In South America and Africa, juvenile white-faced whistling ducks are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.|$|E

5|$|Black {{returns to}} Seattle, researching Gehenna Industries from his home. He uncovers a {{warehouse}} address {{belonging to the}} cult, which Atkins investigates. The warehouse is full of cached weaponry, stockpiled for the cult's doomsday predictions. The cult's leader lures Atkins into the industrial microwave which {{has been used to}} immolate the victims, but the police arrive in time to save him, having been tipped off by Black that Atkins may be in danger. The weapons stockpile allows the police to bring down the cult, but Black is certain that their influence <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> threat.|$|E

5|$|Building {{upon the}} gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} that originated with Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through gametes. No other cells can pass on inherited characters. The work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> major foundation of modern botany. Her books Plant Anatomy and Anatomy of Seed Plants have been key plant structural biology texts {{for more than}} half a century.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{motorway}} {{began in}} 1990, lbut a decade-long hiatus between the mid-1990s and 2004 caused by funding {{issues and the}} setting up of a separate company to develop and operate the motorway meant it was not completed until 2007. As of July 2011, the entire motorway route is completed, consisting of a dual-carriageway and four traffic lanes, except for a relatively short segment which <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> single carriageway road. The motorway is currently operated by Autocesta Zagreb - Macelj.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> great deal {{that remains to be}} explained {{about the nature of the}} Celtic life in the early Christian era. Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood. For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E

5|$|Extremists will {{probably}} deplore {{the fact that}} the composer <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> respecter of form, still a devotee of beauty, still a believer in the potency of melody; but this is rather a matter for congratulation than regret...

What she gave the faithful was easy to digest: largely bulletproof pop, swinging back and forth between brooding, panting torch songs delivered at top volume and grand-scale 1980s-style digital rock with a nightclub twist.|$|E

5|$|IQ classifications from IQ testing are not {{the last}} word on how a test-taker will do in life, nor are they the only {{information}} to be considered for placement in school or job-training programs. There <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> dearth of information about how behavior differs between persons with differing IQ scores. For placement in school programs, for medical diagnosis, and for career advising, factors other than IQ must also be part of an individual assessment.|$|E
5|$|Iceland is {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to create an economy {{generated}} through industries fueled by renewable energy, and there <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> large amount of untapped hydroelectric energy in Iceland.

Iceland’s government believes another 30 TWh of hydropower every year could be produced, whilst taking into account the sources that must remain untapped for environmental reasons.|$|E
