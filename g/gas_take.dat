40|$|In late May, {{the state-run}} oil company PEMEX {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} what it considers a "significant" reserve of natural gas in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. While {{the size of the}} reserve was impressive, some analysts pointed out that low prices, high extraction costs, and an uncertain global market for natural <b>gas</b> <b>take</b> some of the luster off the discovery. The natural gas was discovered while PEMEX was exploring for new supplies of crude oil at the Piklis- 1 well, which, at a depth of 5. 4 km, is the deepest that PEMEX has drilled to date. The reserve appears to contain between 400 and 600 billion cubic feet of gas. In announcing the discovery, Carlos Morales Gil, director of the PEMEX subsidiary Pemex Exploración y Producción (PEP), said the new find, when added to proven reserves in the nearby Lakach field, would greatly increase the PEMEX reserves. By some estimates, recent discoveries could boost PEMEX deposits by almost 1 trillion cubic feet. "Surely, we can produce 700 to 800 million cubic feet of gas per day from this zone," Morales told reporters. The Piklis- 1 well is in a zone known as Cordilleras Mexicanas, about 144 km northwest of the port of Coatzacoalcos in Veracruz state...|$|E

The governing system of nonlinear partial differential equations were derived where conservation laws were applied and implemented to finite element method in two dimensional system. Further, Skyline solver was used to capture highly nonlinear transient process. The characteristic of hygroscopic and nonhygroscopic materials on the drying variables variation was clearly distinguished in this works. The model was further improved {{in the application of}} multilayer membrane structure. Investigation of the dominant variables in this structure during the drying show that liquid diffusivity induced by capillary mechanism is dominant in the constant rate period (CRP) before vapour diffusivity caused by diffusion of vapour pressure and bulk flow <b>gas</b> <b>take</b> place in first falling rate period (FRP 1). Subsequently, when drying reaches the second falling rate period (FRP 2), the bound water mechanism is activated for hygroscopic zone whereas drying is almost accomplished for nonhygroscopic materials. At the shift to a multilayer structure system, top hygroscopic layer exhibits a slower drying rate due to higher water retention associated with its material characteristic compared to nonhygroscopic layers. The model is able to predict proper results with reasonable accuracy at any times. Knowledge gained from this study can be used to assist with the optimization of a given dryer design during drying process of ceramic membrane fabrication...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this study, {{we discuss}} emotion {{classification}} for seven kinds of emotion (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, stress) in the psycho-physiological research. Seven emotions are evoked by stimulus formed on audio-visual film clips, and then physiological signals of {{autonomic nervous system}} responses are measured for the reaction of stimulation. Additionally, seven different emotions will be classified by the proposed classification methodology using physiological signals. We introduce a classification methodology on memory-based learning that dwells upon the usage of genetic strategy (Genetic Algorithms). Genetic algorithms (<b>GAs)</b> <b>take</b> selection problems of instances and features of memory into two level optimization processes. In the first level, GAs chooses P % of instances {{as a set of}} memory comes from instances with c classes. In the second level of the optimization process, GAs is instrumental in the formation of a core set of features that is a collection of the most meaningful and discriminative components of the original feature space. In classification problems, it becomes important to carefully select instances and establish a subset of features in order to achieve a sound performance of a classifier. The study offers a complete algorithmic framework and demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach for the classification of seven emotions. Numerical experiments show that a suitable selection of instances and a substantial reduction of the feature space could be accomplished and the classifier formed in this manner is characterized by high classification accuracy for the seven emotions based on physiological signals.

40|$|The {{separation}} of gas-liquid flows {{is a necessary}} part of many industrial processes. Thus, it has received much attention over the years with the ultimate aim of reducing equipment costs whilst maintaining or improving efficiency. Traditionally, the Petroleum Industry has relied heavily on conventional vessel separators which are bulky, expensive and have a high inventory. Research has indicated that a cheap alternative may be a simple pipe junction. It has been shown that gas-liquid flows can be divided at pipe junctions in such a manner that there is a partial {{separation of}} the phases. The result is two streams - one richer in gas than the initial feed and the other richer in liquid. If the phases can be separated, albeit partially, at a simple pipe junction then the need for a large separator is diminished. Within this thesis the use of a simple T-junction is considered as a continuous, compact, economical partial phase separator with a minimal inventory for use within the oil industry. The main objective was {{to gain a better understanding}} of how a gas-liquid flow is divided at a large diameter T-junction and how the flow split is affected by T-junction geometry. Firstly, the orientation of the side arm from the horizontal was considered with both a regular (inlet arm diameter == branch arm diameter = 0. 127 m) T-junction and a reduced (branch arm to inlet diameter ratio = 0. 6) T-junction. The side arm was placed horizontally (0 '), vertically upwards (+ 90 ') and vertically downwards (- 90 ') and the phase split of air water annular and stratified flows were investigated. To improve the phase separation characteristics of the regular T-junction, inserts protruding from the side arm into the main pipe were considered and for the junction with a vertically downwards side arm a U-bend was used to reduce the fraction of gas pulled through. The experimental investigation was expanded to incorporate the effect of placing two regular T-junctions in series. With the branch arm of the first placed vertically upwards (+ 90 '). and the second vertically downwards (- 90 ') a pure gas stream and a liquid rich stream were created from the multi-phase inlet. Reducing the sidearm diameter of the second junction lowered the fraction of gas drawn off in the liquid rich stream. The physical separation distance the T-junctions was found to have little effect on phase split. The interaction of the two junctions are interdependent and the phase split results from the two junction system was found to be more complex than simply considering the results of two individual T-junctions. Being able to predict the phase split at a junction is vital if they are to be considered seriously within industrial settings. The case of a regular T-junction with a vertically downwards (- 90 ') side arm has received little specific attention. From the linear nature of the phase split results it was determined that if two key points could be accurately predicted then the phase split results can be determined. The "onset of <b>gas</b> <b>take</b> off', the fraction of liquid diverted down the branch arm when the first fraction of gas is pulled through, was successfully related to the bubble rise velocity of the gas entrained in the liquid column trapped in the branch arm. The "critical <b>gas</b> <b>take</b> off”, the fraction of gas diverted when all the liquid is drawn down the branch arm, was determined by relating the fluid flow to the motion of a failing particle...|$|E
40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} is divided into two sectors: the upstream sector in which exploration and production of crude oil and natural <b>gas</b> <b>take</b> place, and the downstream sector in which the crude oil and natural gas are processed in refineries and petrochemical plants. Oil and gas development projects are characterised by large capital investments which include a clear determination of the risks and rewards of each investment opportunity. It is necessary for developing countries to provide an investor-friendly environment towards provisions of numerous incentives to foreign investors, especially international oil companies (IOCs), to increase direct investment flows. The establishment of a stable and secure environment is a fundamental way that host governments can {{play a vital role in}} reducing risk and promoting opportunity through the implementation of suitable regulatory terms and conditions for exploration and production (E&P) work, as well as sufficient economic incentives to attract foreign investment capital. In general, IOCs will diversify risks and prioritise their portfolios to invest in the potential markets that can provide them the highest commercial return. Evidence from Thailand indicates that IOCs require a favourable investment climate to maintain active development of upstream oil and gas resources. Due to the high-risk nature of Thailand's geological setting, IOCs need to have managerial and operational flexibilities when investing in and executing work programmes without mandatory government intervention. The Thai Government needs to consider whether regulation and incentives are written in ways that help facilitate new foreign investments. Apart from legal certainty, Thailand's upstream investment climate can also be strengthened by enhancing the working relationship between the government and the IOCs.

40|$|The Baikal rift is {{characterized}} by high heat flow, seismic activity and large thickness of sediments through which gas and hydrothermal water are intensely released into the lake water. In {{the area of the}} southern Baikal {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century, 'water pillars' were observed to reach almost a dozen metres height when earthquakes took place. This suggests potential uplift of significant amounts of gas from the lake's bottom into the atmosphere and confirms a relationship between seismicity and methane emissions. Moreover, strong emissions of <b>gas</b> <b>take</b> place in many regions of Lake Baikal, and when the lake is covered by ice, such phenomena can cause the occurrence of spots with melted ice wherein an effect of water 'boiling' is observed. In recent international space studies of the surface of ice covering Lake Baikal in spring periods, mysterious rings of 5 to 7 km in diameter were discovered. Causes and mechanisms of their occurrence have not been studied in detail yet. It is established that a ring-shaped structure results from an uplift of deep water which causes clock-wise vortex flows. Uplifting of deep water can accompany emissions of significant amounts of methane from sediments, activation of thermal vents or gas-water-mud volcanoes at the bottom of Lake Baikal. In order to reveal causes and conditions of the above-described phenomena, the author designed a 3 D model of heat-and-mass transfer in viscous medium and used it for numerical simulations. Based on the obtained results, it is established that a ring-shaped structure is formed on ice of the lake by a toroid-shaped ascending convective flow that occurs due to horizontal and vertical gradients of density, and the central part of such a flow rotates in the counter-clockwise direction (i. e. cyclonic vortex), while its periphery parts rotate in the clockwise direction (i. e. anticyclonic vortex).   Both hydrothermal vents and gas emissions can produce such ascending flows. Spots with melted ice can be formed when the temperature of hydrothermal vents amounts to 30 – 50 °С; such a melted-ice spot can stay open as long as the hydrothermal vent is active. With an assumption of 100 % concentration of gas in the source, the numerical simulation shows that during gas release into the atmosphere, a gas pillar can reach a height of 15 metres if the source of gas is active for a period no shorter than the time required for the gas flow to ascend through the water layer and to release into the air above the water surface. An area, wherein gas is released in bubbles, can be formed in case of lasting activity of a gas source wherein the volume of gas varies from 1 % to 20 % (i. e. gas-water mix).  </p...|$|E
