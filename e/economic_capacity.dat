5|$|Following {{the death}} of Gaozong and the {{emergence}} of the Mongols, the Song dynasty formed a military alliance with the Mongols in the hope of finally defeating the Jin dynasty. Several tens of thousands of carts full of grain were sent to the Mongol army during the siege. Following the destruction of the Jurchens in 1234, the Southern Song generals broke the alliance, proceeding to recapture the three historical capitals of Kaifeng, Luoyang and Chang'an. However, the cities, ravaged by years of warfare, lacked <b>economic</b> <b>capacity</b> and yielded little defensibility. This breaking of alliance meant open warfare between the Mongols and the Song Chinese. Ögodei Khan's forces conquered fifty-four out of Sichuan's fifty-eight total districts by 1236, while ordering the slaughter of over a million people that inhabited the city of Chengdu, which was taken by the Mongols with ease.|$|E

Despite never having been trained in economic matters, Thơ had a prominent hand {{in the administration of}} the Commodity Import Program, an American initiative akin to the Marshall Plan, whereby aid was funnelled into the economy through importing licenses rather than money, in order to avoid inflation. However, Thơ's administration of the program led to {{the vast majority of the}} imports being consumer goods for the upper classes, rather than capital goods to develop South Vietnam's <b>economic</b> <b>capacity.</b> Under Thơ's watch, the foreign trade deficit hovered between 150 and 200%, and the gap between the urban elite and the peasant majority grew. American advisers thought Thơ and the Ngô brothers continually went against their counsel because they were either incompetent or simply distrustful and thus did the opposite of what was recommended.|$|E
25|$|Doyle and Sambanis' {{analysis}} {{finds that}} lasting peace {{is more likely}} after non-ethnic wars in countries with a relatively high level of development in addition {{to whether or not}} UN peacekeeping forces and financial assistance are available. They conclude that in the short run lasting peace is more dependent on a robust UN deployment coupled with low levels of hostility between belligerents. They note that increased <b>economic</b> <b>capacity</b> can provide an incentive not to renew hostilities. In the long run, however, <b>economic</b> <b>capacity</b> matters far more whereas the degree of hostility between belligerents is less important. As successful as UN deployments can be, they have inadequately spurred independent economic development within the countries where they have intervened. Thus, the UN plays a strong, but indirect role and success in lasting peace is predicated on the development of institutions that support peace, rather than serving as a deterrent for renewed war.|$|E

Condemnation of the Soviets by the League of Nations and by countries all over the world had no effect on Soviet policy. International help for Finland was planned, but very little actual help materialized, except from Sweden. The Moscow Peace Treaty, which was signed on 12 March 1940, ended the Winter War.

25|$|Interest towards {{membership}} of the European Economic Community (EEC) developed in Ireland during the 1950s, with consideration also given to {{membership of}} the European Free Trade Area. As the United Kingdom intended on EEC membership, Ireland applied for membership in July 1961 due to the substantial economic linkages with the United Kingdom. However, the founding EEC members remained skeptical regarding Ireland's <b>economic</b> <b>capacity,</b> neutrality, and unattractive protectionist policy. Many Irish economists and politicians realised that economic policy reform was necessary. The prospect of EEC membership became doubtful in 1963 when French President General Charles de Gaulle stated that France opposed Britain's accession, which ceased negotiations with all other candidate countries. However, in 1969 his successor, Georges Pompidou, was not opposed to British and Irish membership. Negotiations began and in 1972 the Treaty of Accession was signed. A referendum held in 1972 confirmed Ireland's entry, and it finally joined the EEC in 1973.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Nowadays, {{industry}} {{transfer from}} the coastal areas {{to the central}} region and the west areas has become an essential measure for our national adjusting of industrial layout. Because the central region has a superior location advantage of undertaking east and opening west, it becomes key areas for undertaking industries. Therefore, whether the <b>economic</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> of the central region can adapt to this large-scale industrial transfer will {{be the key to}} seize the opportunity. According to the experience of international industrial transfer, large-scale industrial transfer is bound to bring about inevitably rapid increase in employment, so the article tries to use the three industrial employment data of the three central region provinces (Anhui, Jiangxi and Hunan) and the three coastal provinces (Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang) from 1978 to 2010, and then constructs the ARIMA model to forecast the employment of three industries from 2011 to 2015. Through comparatively analyzing prediction of employment changes of the central and the coastal provinces in the next few years, it will resolve some problems such as the <b>economic</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> of the central region undertaking the coastal industrial transfer, and three conclusions have been pointed out: 1) taking the coastal <b>economic</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> as a benchmark, the <b>economic</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> of the central region has not been saturated; 2) viewing the prediction of employment changes of the coastal and central region, the coastal industrial transfer has not formed in scale trend in the next few years; 3) from the terms of the changes of the future growth of the three industries, the undeveloped secondary industry is the bottleneck factor in restricting the improvement of <b>economic</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> for undertaking the coastal industrial transfer, and the low proportion of the third industry in the coastal areas is the viscosity factor in restricting the transfer of industries to the central region. ...|$|R

However, although these studies consider the temporal, structural, and spatial characters of human interactions they commonly miss one important dimension regarding the economic status of individuals. <b>Economic</b> <b>capacities</b> of people may largely determine their communications and social behaviour thus the emerging structure of the global social­communication network. Studies combining the social network with economic data could help us to better understand spatial, and social segregation, or economic imbalances evolving in the society.

We use a communication dataset recorded by a single mobile phone provider in Mexico, which collects geo­localised mobile phone interactions of 92 M people over 2 years [1].

The credit data collect the time and amount of bank card purchases and the monthly evolution of incomes, spendings, and debts of 1 M clients of the cell phone operator.
