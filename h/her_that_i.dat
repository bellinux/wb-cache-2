25|$|In {{the words}} of soprano Montserrat Caballé:She opened a new door for us, for all the singers in the world, a door that had been closed. Behind it was {{sleeping}} not only great music but great idea of interpretation. She has given us the chance, those who follow her, {{to do things that}} were hardly possible before <b>her.</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> am compared with Callas is something I never dared to dream. It is not right. I am much smaller than Callas.|$|E
25|$|By the way, {{would you}} convey my {{compliments}} to the purist who reads your proofs {{and tell him}} or <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> write {{in a sort of}} broken-down patois which is something like the way a Swiss-waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will remain split, and when I interrupt the velvety smoothness of my more or less literate syntax with a few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this is done with the eyes wide open and the mind relaxed and attentive. The method may not be perfect, but it is all I have.|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless, the Emperor's {{infatuation with}} the Countess {{sometimes}} put Teresa Cristina {{in an awkward}} position, as when her younger daughter Leopoldina naively asked her why PedroII kept nudging Barral's foot during their class. The Countess's increasing intimacy {{with her husband and}} daughter was painful and vexing to Teresa Cristina. Although she feigned ignorance of the situation, it did not pass unnoticed. She wrote in her diary that Barral [...] "wished to make me tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not like her, but I did not say either yes or no." [...] Historian Tobias Monteiro wrote that the Empress [...] "could not disguise that she detested Barral." ...|$|E

Don't make <b>her</b> think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am too anxious to retain this {{particular}} sister, but make <b>her</b> understand <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not wish to begin all over again with another one. Also, do not insist too strongly on my desire to write a love-story, but put it to <b>her</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> plan out work of course I want to do the work as I have planned it. Try to keep these important points in your mind; then you can urge common sense upon her as much as you please." ...|$|R
500|$|Barbara Holper was the {{daughter}} of Hieronymus Holper, under whom Albrecht the Elder served his apprenticeship as a goldsmith. The two men became friends, and when she came of age Holper gave his daughter into marriage when Dürer senior was 40 and she was 15. The couple were compatible, well-matched and fond of each other. Yet their son's writings detail their difficult lives and many setbacks; three of their 18 children survived into adulthood – 17 of whom had been born by the time of this portrait. After her husband died Barbara was destitute and went to live with her son. After she in turn died in 1514, her son wrote [...] "This my pious Mother... often had the plague and many other severe and strange illnesses, and she suffered great poverty, scorn, contempt, mocking words, terrors, and great adversities. Yet she bore no malice. Also she died hard... I felt so grieved for <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot express it." ...|$|E
500|$|Priyanka Chopra was Bhardwaj's {{original}} {{choice for}} the role of Susanna after he worked with the actress in Kaminey: He said that Chopra [...] "is the finest actor of her generation right now... As a director I had so much trust on <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt that no one else can essay this role as brilliantly as she would do". Mohanlal was cast as one of Susanna's husbands in the film; however, he left the project to concentrate on Malayalam films. The actor was replaced by Annu Kapoor in the role of Inspector Keemat Lal. Other actors in the film were John Abraham, Naseeruddin Shah, Neil Nitin Mukesh and Vivaan Shah. Directors Karan Johar and Imtiaz Ali were approached to play two of the seven husbands, but they reportedly turned down the offer. Usha Uthup was cast as Susanna's maid in the film. Konkona Sen Sharma was confirmed for a cameo appearance.|$|E
500|$|In October 2017, former New York Times {{reporter}} Sharon Waxman {{wrote on}} TheWrap that, {{when she looked}} into the allegations of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein in 2004, Russell Crowe and Damon made direct phone calls to her to vouch for the head of Miramax Italy, Fabrizio Lombardo, whom she suspected of having [...] "no film experience" [...] and whose [...] "real job was {{to take care of}} Weinstein’s women needs" [...] in Europe. Damon responded in an interview with Deadline, [...] "For the record, I would never, ever, ever try to kill a story like that... It’s not something I would do, for anybody". He said that he had known Lombardo [...] "in a professional capacity" [...] while working on The Talented Mr. Ripley, so he called the reporter and relayed his experience with Lombardo at Weinstein's request. [...] "That was the extent of it....I’m sure I mentioned to <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn’t know anything about the rest of her piece, because I didn’t." [...] Waxman has since endorsed Damon’s statement on Twitter.|$|E

"You had it from <b>her</b> lips <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had NOT ill-treated her; and at {{the same}} time another had it from <b>her</b> lips <b>that</b> <b>I</b> HAD ill-treated <b>her?</b> My mother was no {{impulsive}} woman who changed her opinion every hour without reason. How can it be, Venn, that she should have told such different stories in close succession?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Randal {{passed this}} over without notice. [...] "Be so good," [...] he said, [...] "as to tell Catherine <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{try to make}} every {{possible}} allowance for <b>her,</b> but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot consent to sit at <b>her</b> dinner-table, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> dare not face my poor little niece, after what I have heard." ...|$|R

500|$|Chaplin {{believed}} his first influence {{to be his}} mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting {{at the window and}} mimicking passers-by: [...] "it was through watching <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> learned not only how to express emotions with my hands and face, but also how to observe and study people." [...] Chaplin's early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work; he also attended the Christmas pantomimes at Drury Lane, where he studied the art of clowning through performers like Dan Leno. [...] Chaplin's years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker. Simon Louvish writes that the company was his [...] "training ground", and it was here that Chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy. The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno, who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplin's gags. From the film industry, Chaplin drew upon the work of the French comedian Max Linder, whose films he greatly admired. In developing the Tramp costume and persona, he was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene, where tramp characters were common.|$|E
500|$|To avoid a {{scheduling}} {{conflict with}} Revolutionary Road, Winslet {{turned down an}} offer to star in The Reader. After her replacement Nicole Kidman left the project due to her pregnancy, Winslet was signed to it. Directed by Stephen Daldry, The Reader is based on Bernhard Schlink's novel {{of the same name}} and is about Hanna Schmitz, an illiterate Nazi camp guard (Winslet), who has an affair with a teenage boy. Winslet researched on the Holocaust and the SS guards, and was traumatised by what she learnt. To educate herself on the stigma attached to illiteracy, she spent time with students at the Literacy Partners, an organisation that teaches adults to read and write. A merkin was designed for her frontal nude scenes, but she refused to wear it. Winslet was unable to sympathise with Schmitz, saying that [...] "there was nothing of <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could relate to", and struggled to find [...] "honesty and truthfulness" [...] to the part without humanising her actions. Despite this, certain historians criticised the film for making Schmitz an object of audience's sympathy and accused the filmmakers of Holocaust revisionism. Even so, Winslet's performance was acclaimed; the critic Todd McCarthy commended her for supplying [...] "a haunting shell to this internally decimated woman", and writing for The Daily Telegraph, Sukhdev Sandhu considered her to be [...] "absolutely fearless here, not just in her willingness to expose herself physically, but her refusal to expose her character psychologically".|$|E
2500|$|Thomas {{testified that}} the accusations against him were false and that, [...] "I deny each and every single {{allegation}} against me today that suggested {{in any way that}} I had conversations of a sexual nature or about pornographic material with Anita Hill, that I ever attempted to date <b>her,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ever had any personal sexual interest in her, or that I in any way ever harassed her." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Hitchens {{thought he}} was the only witness called by the Vatican, Aroup Chatterjee (author of Mother Teresa: The Untold Story) was also called to present {{evidence}} opposing Teresa's beatification and canonisation; the Vatican had abolished the traditional [...] "devil's advocate", which served a similar purpose. Hitchens said that [...] "her intention was not to help people", and she lied to donors about how their contributions were used. [...] "It was by talking to <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> discovered, and she assured me, that she wasn't working to alleviate poverty", he said, [...] "She was working to expand the number of Catholics. She said, 'I'm not a social worker. I don't do it for this reason. I do it for Christ. I do it for the church.|$|E
2500|$|He {{turned his}} {{basement}} into [...] practice {{space for a}} band he formed with high-school friends. After the band began earning income from small performances at high-school shows or other events, he decided {{to drop out of}} high school and play rock and roll professionally. His mother was devastated when he told her, and he still feels that he owes her for the disappointments in her life. [...] "All the shit I put her through," [...] he says, [...] "on top {{of the fact that she}} just lost her husband. I felt like I had to make sure that it was worth it. I wanted to show <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a professional, that I was working hard, and wasn't just a fuckin' lunatic." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, back at Lotus, Hill {{helped to}} develop the Lotus 49 with the new Cosworth-V8 engine. After {{teammates}} Jim Clark and Mike Spence were killed in early 1968, Hill led the team, and won his second world championship in 1968. The Lotus had a reputation of being very fragile and dangerous at that time, especially with the new aerodynamic aids which caused similar crashes of Hill and Jochen Rindt at the 1969 Spanish Grand Prix. A crash at the 1969 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen broke both his legs and interrupted his career. Typically, when asked soon after the crash {{if he wanted to}} pass on a message to his wife, Hill replied [...] "Just tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> won't be dancing for two weeks." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{collision}} with the iceberg at 11:40 pm on 14 April 1912, Navratil placed Michel and Edmond in Collapsible D, the last lifeboat successfully launched from the ship. Michel, although not quite {{four years old}} at the time, later claimed to remember his father telling him, [...] "My child, when your mother comes for you, as she surely will, tell <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> loved her dearly and still do. Tell her I expected her to follow us, so that we might all live happily together in the peace and freedom of the New World." [...] The elder Navratil died in the sinking, and his body was recovered by the rescue ship, Mackay-Bennett. In his pocket was a revolver. Because of his assumed Jewish surname, he was buried in Baron de Hirsch Cemetery, Halifax, a Jewish cemetery in Nova Scotia.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked what}} made her singing style unique, she once said [...] "my feeling for a lyric, I'm a storyteller and I try to have {{excellent}} diction so you don't have to guess what I'm saying. Some people listen to a song for years and don't know what the lyric is." [...] In 1965 while listening to “Violets For Your Furs” by Billie Holiday, Alexandria said:"There’s not too much left to say about Billie Holiday, {{how is it possible}} for a woman to be this great? This comes from a period when she wasn’t supposed to be singing too well but I’ve never heard anything by <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn’t realize what she was feeling which is very important regardless of the shape of the pipes or what may be happening [...] She always got the message across. She never failed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kirsten {{told police}} he went to Cornell’s room at 12:15a.m., but couldn't access the locked room. He then had a {{telephone}} conversation with Vicky Cornell. [...] "I told Vicky that they wouldn’t come {{open the door and}} she told me to kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found the bedroom door locked. I called the hotel operator and told <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, and I told them that I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before it somehow popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She told me that she called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident." [...] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell's neck then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success. Cornell was pronounced dead at 1:30a.m., an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell's wife. It's unknown how long it took the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.|$|E
