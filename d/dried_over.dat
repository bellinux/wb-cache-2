25|$|Brown bear (grizzly) Ursus arctos horribilis (taqukaq, carayak Yup'ik and Cup'ik, paugnar in Cup'ig) and Black bear Ursus americanus (tan'gerliq in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, tungulzria in Cup'ig) were {{harvested}} {{for food}} (meat and fat). Bear meat (tan'gerlim kemga) made into jerky was often <b>dried</b> <b>over</b> {{a couple of}} weeks time. The internal organs, such as heart, kidneys, and intestines were often distributed to elders. Both black and brown bear meat was considered very tasty and was prepared by drying, boiling, baking, and roasting. The bones were boiled so that all of the meat could easily be removed from them. The marrow was only occasionally used because the bones are very thick and not easily broken. The liver was considered to be too rich and was not eaten.|$|E
2500|$|World War II brought {{production}} at Lilly {{to a new}} high with the manufacturing of Merthiolate and penicillin. During the war Lilly also cooperated with the American Red Cross to process blood plasma and by war's end the company had <b>dried</b> <b>over</b> two million pints of blood, [...] "about 20 percent of the United States' total". Merthiolate, first introduced in 1930, was an [...] "anticeptic and germicide" [...] that became a U.S. army [...] "standard issue" [...] during World War II. In the early 1940s Lilly {{became one of the}} companies mass-producing penicillin.|$|E

50|$|M. nheco is fed upon by {{southern}} caimans (Caiman crocodilus yacare) {{when its}} habitat <b>dries</b> <b>over</b> the winter, which makes these fish easier to catch. These fish are often hosts to tongue worms, which inhabit their swim bladders.|$|R
50|$|This plant {{produces}} cream-colored {{flowers in}} April and May. The seedlings grow slowly and several years pass before the plants reach reproductive maturity. The species {{is adapted to}} drought, remaining metabolically active in habitat that is <b>dry</b> <b>over</b> the summer.|$|R
2500|$|The {{production}} of copra – removing the shell, breaking it up, drying – is usually done where the coconut palms grow. Copra {{can be made}} by smoke drying, sun drying, or kiln drying. Hybrid solar drying system [...] is also used to make drying process runs continuously, therefore it will reduce drying time. In hybrid solar drying system, solar energy is utilized during daylight and energy from burning biomass is used when sunlight is not sufficient or during night. Sun drying requires little more than racks and sufficient sunlight. [...] Halved nuts are drained of water, and left with the meat facing the sky; they can be washed to remove mold-creating contaminants. [...] After two days the meat can be removed from the shell with ease, and the drying process is complete after three to five more days (up to seven in total). [...] Sun drying is often combined with kiln drying, eight hours of exposure to sunlight means the time spent in a kiln can be reduced by a day and the hot air the shells are exposed to in the kiln is more easily able to remove the remaining moisture. [...] This process can also be reversed, partially drying the copra in the kiln and finishing the process with sunlight. [...] There are advantages and disadvantages in both – starting with sun drying requires careful inspection to avoid contamination with mold while starting with kiln-drying can harden the meat and prevent it from drying out completely in the sun. [...] In India, small but whole coconuts can be <b>dried</b> <b>over</b> the course of eight months to a year, and the meat inside removed and sold as a whole ball. [...] Meat prepared in this fashion is sweet, soft, oily and is cream-coloured instead of being white. [...] Coconut meat can be dried using direct heat and smoke from a fire, using simple racks to suspend the coconut over the fire. [...] The smoke residue can help preserve the half-dried meat but the process overall suffers from unpredictable results and the risk of fires.|$|E

25|$|Air-cured {{tobacco is}} hung in well-ventilated barns and allowed to <b>dry</b> <b>over</b> a period of four to eight weeks. Air-cured tobacco is low in sugar, which gives the tobacco smoke a light, mild flavor, and high in nicotine. Cigar and burley tobaccos are 'dark' air-cured.|$|R
50|$|The pods {{are used}} as a spice, {{in a similar manner}} to the green Indian {{cardamom}} pods, but with a different flavor. Unlike green cardamom, this spice is rarely used in sweet dishes. Its smoky flavor and aroma derive from traditional methods of <b>drying</b> <b>over</b> open flames.|$|R
50|$|Gourd art {{involves}} creating {{works of}} art using Lagenaria spp. hard-shell gourds as an art medium. Gourd surfaces may be carved, painted, sanded, burned, dyed, and polished. Typically, a harvested gourd is left to <b>dry</b> <b>over</b> {{a period of months}} before the woody surface is suitable for decorating.|$|R
60|$|The can was <b>dried</b> <b>over</b> the fire, the cocoa was replaced, {{and then}} the lads {{proceeded}} to make themselves comfortable for the night. They missed their blankets, and it was therefore decided that they should take turns in sitting up and guarding the fire, so that all might keep warm without running the danger of setting fire to the cedars under which they were resting.|$|E
60|$|The black sand, which, {{along with}} the gold, is usually left after all the washing and rocking {{processes}} are completed, is too heavy to be separated by means of washing. It has therefore to be blown away from the gold after the mass has been <b>dried</b> <b>over</b> a fire, and in this operation great care is requisite lest the finer particles of gold should be blown off along with it.|$|E

2500|$|From 1965–68, eastern Australia {{was again}} greatly {{affected}} by drought. Conditions had been <b>dry</b> <b>over</b> {{the centre of}} the continent since 1957 but spread elsewhere during the summer of 1964/1965. This drought contributed to the 1967 Tasmanian fires in which 62people died in one day and 1,400 homes were lost.|$|R

60|$|I {{was raised}} {{to my feet and}} half carried, half dragged along {{in the midst of the}} gang. My horse had already been led away in the {{opposite}} direction. Our course lay off the road, down a very rocky and rugged ravine which sloped away towards the sea. There seemed to be no trace of a path, and I could only stumble along over rocks and bushes as best I might in my fettered and crippled state. The blood, however, had <b>dried</b> <b>over</b> my wounds, and the cool sea breeze playing upon my forehead refreshed me, and helped me to take a clearer view of my position.|$|E
60|$|The {{prisoners were}} then {{taken to a}} cell and searched with the utmost rigour. Their clothes were {{examined}} with scrupulous care, many of the seams being cut open and the linings slit, {{to see if any}} documents were concealed there. Their shoes were also carefully examined; but the mud had <b>dried</b> <b>over</b> the opening where the quill was concealed, and the officials failed to discover it. Even their sticks were carefully examined to see if they contained any hollow place; but at last, convinced that had they been the bearers of any documents these must have been discovered, the officials permitted them to resume their clothes, and then paying no heed to the angry complaints of Malcolm at the state to which the garments had been reduced, they left the prisoners to themselves.|$|E
6000|$|Caldwell stood {{close to}} her, {{shouting}} his explanations in her ear, while she strained to follow them. But she was bewildered and entranced by the marvellous swiftness, accuracy and {{ease with which}} each of the complex machines, fed by human hands, performed its function. These human hands were swift, too, as when they thrust the bobbins of roving on the ring-spinning frames to be twisted into yarn. She saw a woman, {{in the space of}} an instant, mend a broken thread. Women and boys were here, doffer boys to lift off the full bobbins of yarn with one hand and set on the empty bobbins with the other: while skilled workmen, alert for the first sign of trouble, followed up and down in its travels the long frame of the mule-spinner. After the spinning, the heavy spools of yarn were carried to a beam-warper, standing alone like a huge spider's web, where hundreds of threads were stretched symmetrically and wound evenly, side by side, on a large cylinder, forming the warp of the fabric to be woven on the loom. First, however, this warp must be stiffened or [...] "slashed" [...] in starch and tallow, <b>dried</b> <b>over</b> heated drums, and finally wound around one great beam from which the multitude of threads are taken up, one by one, and slipped {{through the eyes of the}} loom harnesses by women who sit all day under the north windows overlooking the canal--the [...] "drawers-in" [...] of whom Ditmar had spoken. Then the harnesses are put on the loom, the threads attached to the cylinder on which the cloth is to be wound. The looms absorbed and fascinated Janet above all else. It seemed as if she would never tire of watching the rhythmic rise and fall of the harnesses,--each rapid movement making a V in the warp, within the angle of which the tiny shuttles darted to and fro, to and fro, carrying the thread that filled the cloth with a swiftness so great the eye could scarcely follow it; to be caught on the other side when the angle closed, and flung back, and back again! And in the elaborate patterns not one, but several harnesses were used, each awaiting its turn for the impulse bidding it rise and fall!... Abruptly, as she gazed, one of the machines halted, a weaver hurried up, searched the warp for the broken thread, tied it, and started the loom again.|$|E

50|$|<b>Drying</b> malt <b>over</b> an {{open flame}} may impart a smoky {{character}} to the malt. This character may {{carry over to}} beers brewed with the smoked malt. Prior to the modern era, drying malted barley in direct sunlight was used in addition to <b>drying</b> <b>over</b> flames. Even though kiln drying of malt, using indirect heat, did not enter into widespread usage until the industrial era, the method was known {{as early as the}} first century BC. Also, there have been various methods over the years of preparing cereal grains for brewing, including making beer from bread, so smoked beer was not universal.|$|R
