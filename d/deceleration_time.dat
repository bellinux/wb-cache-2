In an attempt to determine whether this “restrictive” physiology could be demonstrated noninvasively, 14 patients who had a history, physical examination, two-dimensional echocardiogram and catheterization data compatible with a restrictive myocardial process were studied with pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound. Forty normal subjects served as a control group. The Doppler ultrasound evaluation included measurement of peak mitral and tricuspid flow velocities and flow velocity integrals, mitral and tricuspid <b>deceleration</b> <b>times</b> and central venous flow patterns during apnea and inspiration. The flow velocity recordings across the mitral and tricuspid valves in patients manifesting restriction were markedly different from those in normal subjects, showing shortened <b>deceleration</b> <b>times</b> across both valves, which indicated both an abrupt premature cessation of ventricular filling and the presence of a diastolic dip-plateau contour in ventricular pressure recordings.

5000|$|The final impact after a passenger's body {{hits the}} car interior, airbag or seat belts {{is that of}} the {{internal}} organs hitting the ribcage or skull due to their inertia.

Other ways are skeletal damage and blood loss, because of torn blood vessels, or damage caused by sharp fractured bone to organs and/or blood vessels. The sequence of energy-dissipating and speed-reducing technologies—crumple zone — seat belt — airbags — padded interior—are designed to work together as a system to reduce the force of the impact {{on the outside of the}} passenger(s)'s body and the final impact of organs inside the body.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{assess the}} {{relations}} between early filling <b>deceleration</b> <b>time,</b> left ventricular remodelling, and cardiac mortality in an unselected group of postinfarction patients.  DESIGN AND PATIENTS—Prospective evaluation of 131  consecutive patients with first acute myocardial infarction. Echocardiography was performed on day 1, day 2, day 3, day 7, at three and six weeks, and at three, six, and 12  months after infarction. According to <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> on day 1, patients were divided into groups with short (< 150  ms) and normal <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> (⩾  150 ms).  SETTING—Tertiary care centre.  RESULTS—Patients with a short <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> had higher end systolic and end diastolic volume indices and a higher wall motion score index, but a lower ejection fraction, in the year after infarction. These patients also showed {{a significant increase in}} end diastolic (p <  0. 001) and end systolic volume indices (p =  0. 007) during the follow up period, while ejection fraction and wall motion score index remained unchanged. In the group with normal <b>deceleration</b> <b>time,</b> end diastolic volume index increased (p <  0. 001) but end systolic volume index did not change; in addition, the ejection fraction increased (p =  0. 002) and the wall motion score index decreased (p <  0. 001). One year and five year survival analysis showed greater cardiac mortality in patients with a short <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> (p =  0. 04 and p =  0. 02, respectively).

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether a new variable of mitral inflow, A wave <b>deceleration</b> <b>time,</b> identifies patients with elevated left ventricular filling pressures. Background. In patients with an elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, the increase in left ventricular pressure after atrial contraction rapidly exceeds left atrial pressure, resulting in abrupt cessation of the A wave. Therefore, we postulated that a shortening of A wave <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> might be a marker for elevated end-diastolic pressure. Methods. Adequate pulsed Doppler mitral inflow velocities could be recorded in 40 of 44 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac catheterization simultaneosly with capillary wedge pressure in 20 patients, and within 1 h after left ventricular end-diastolic pressure recording in 20. Fifteen healthy volunteers were also studied. Results. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was 8 to 35 mm Hg, and mean pulmonary wedge pressure was 6 to 37 mm Hg. Close correlations were found between A wave <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> and mean pulmonary wedge pressure (r = − 0. 87) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (r = − 0. 74). There were modest correlations between both pressures and peak E/A, E wave <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> and A wave duration, respectively: r = 0. 59, − 0. 30 and − 0. 58 for capillary wedge and r = 0. 25, − 0. 38 and − 0. 49 for end-diastolic pressures.

Methods and Results—Echocardiograms were recorded in 728 hypertensive patients with ECG-verified LV hypertrophy (Cornell voltage-duration or Sokolow-Lyon) at baseline and after 1 year of blinded treatment with either losartan or atenolol-based regimen. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) were reduced on average 23 / 11 mm Hg; isovolumic relaxation time and E/A ratio became more normal, and LV inflow <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> prolonged (all P 0. 001). Directionally opposite changes in isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> indicate improvement in active LV relaxation and passive chamber stiffness during early diastole.

Some patients showed a “restrictive filling pattern,” similar to that associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy, characterized by predominant E waves and a shortened E <b>deceleration</b> <b>time.</b> Methods. Pulsed Doppler transmitral curves were analyzed in 79 consecutive patients with dilated cardiomyopathy assigned to two study groups according to E <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> group 1 (n = 36) had a restrictive left ventricular filling pattern (E <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> < 115 ms); group 2 (n = 43) had an E <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> ≥ 115 ms. Result. Patients in group 1 were significantly younger, in a higher New York Heart Association functional class, more frequently had a third heart sound and had a higher left ventricular pressure at catheterization. In addition, they showed more severe left and right ventricular dysfunction and dilation, a larger left atrium and more severe mitral regurgitation. A restrictive filling pattern was associated at Doppter study with a higher E wave velocity, lower A wave velocity and higher E/A ratio. During a follow-up interval of 22 ± 14 months, all 14 patients who subsequently died or required heart transplntation showed a restrictive left ventricular filling pattern.

40|$|Most {{adults can}} skillfully avoid {{potential}} obstacles when acting in everyday cluttered scenes. We examined how gaze and hand movements are normally coordinated for obstacle avoidance and whether these are altered when binocular depth information is unavailable. Visual fixations and hand movement kinematics were simultaneously recorded, while 13 right-handed subjects reached-to-precision grasp a cylindrical household object presented {{alone or with}} a potential obstacle (wine glass) located to its left (thumb's grasp side), right or just behind it (both closer to the finger's grasp side) using binocular or monocular vision. Gaze and hand movement strategies differed significantly by view and obstacle location. With binocular vision, initial fixations were near the target's centre of mass (COM) {{around the time of}} hand movement onset, but usually shifted to end just above the thumb's grasp site at initial object contact, this mainly being made by the thumb, consistent with selecting this digit for guiding the grasp. This strategy was associated with faster binocular hand movements and improved end-point grip precision across all trials than with monocular viewing, during which subjects usually continued to fixate the target closer to its COM despite a similar prevalence of thumb-first contacts. While subjects looked directly at the obstacle at each location on a minority of trials and their overall fixations on the target were somewhat biased towards the grasp side nearest to it, these gaze behaviours were particularly marked on monocular vision-obstacle behind trials which also commonly ended in finger-first contact. Subjects avoided colliding with the wine glass under both views when on the right (finger side) of the workspace by producing slower and straighter reaches, with this and the behind obstacle location also resulting in 'safer' (i. e. narrower) peak grip apertures and longer <b>deceleration</b> <b>times</b> than when the goal object was alone or the obstacle was on its thumb side. But monocular reach paths were more variable and <b>deceleration</b> <b>times</b> were selectively prolonged on finger-side and behind obstacle trials, with this latter condition further resulting in selectively increased grip closure times and corrections. Binocular vision thus provided added advantages for collision avoidance, known to require intact dorsal cortical stream processing mechanisms, particularly when the target of the grasp and potential obstacle to it were fairly closely separated in depth. Different accounts of the altered monocular gaze behaviour converged on the conclusion that additional perceptual and/or attentional resources are likely engaged compared to when continuous binocular depth information is available.

A total of 508 patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35 % were followed up for a mean (±SD) period of 29 ± 11 months. Results. During the follow-up period, 148 patients (29. 1 %) were admitted to the hospital for congestive heart failure, and 100 patients (19. 7 %) died. By Cox model analysis, Doppler-derived mitral <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> of early filling ≤ 125 ms (relative risk [RR] 1. 93, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 4 to 3. 7), New York Heart Association functional class III or IV (RR 1. 49, 95 % CI 1. 4 to 2. 3), ejection fraction ≤ 25 % (RR 1. 85, 95 % CI 1. 6 to 2. 9), third heart sound (RR 2. 06, 95 % CI 1. 8 to 3. 2), age > 60 years (RR 1. 95, 95 % CI 1. 8 to 3. 1) and left atrial area > 18 cm 2 (RR 1. 73, 95 % CI 1. 6 to 2. 7) were all found to be independent and additional predictors of all-cause mortality, and <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> was the single best predictor (chi-square 37. 80). When all these significant variables were analyzed in hierarchic order, after age, functional class, third sound, ejection fraction and left atrial area, <b>deceleration</b> <b>time</b> still added significant prognostic information (global chi-square from 9. 2 to 104. 7).

In a stepwise forward regression model, NT-pro-ANP correlated significantly with left atrial diameter (r =  0. 603; p <  0. 001), left ventricular ejection fraction (r = − 0. 758; p <  0. 001), and Doppler derived E/A ratio (r =  0. 740; p <  0. 001).  CONCLUSIONS—In patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy there is a relation between NT-pro-ANP and both systolic and diastolic variables. In a multivariate model NT-pro-ANP correlated with left atrial diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction, and Doppler derived E/A ratio on transmitral inflow.    Keywords: idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; transmitral Doppler filling; N-terminal pro-ANP; atrial natriuretic facto...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] In {{patients}} with drug resistant incessant supraventricular tachycardia, radiofrequency induced ablation of the atrioventricular junction and pacemaker implantation have hitherto {{been considered a}} treatment of last resort. OBJECTIVE [...] To assess the {{short and long term}} effects of ablation of the atrioventricular junction on systolic and diastolic left ventricular function in {{patients with}} atrial fibrillation with and without impaired left ventricular function. PATIENTS [...] 29 patients (19 men; mean age 65 (SD 7) years (range 50 - 76)) undergoing ablation of the atrioventricular junction for drug refractory atrial fibrillation were examined a mean of 2, 65, and 216 days after ablation of the bundle of His. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Left ventricular ejection fraction and early filling <b>deceleration</b> <b>times</b> (Edec) were assessed by Doppler echocardiography after 1 to 2 hours of ventricular pacing at a rate of 80 beats/minute. RESULTS [...] In 14 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction or = 50 % at the initial examination no significant change in systolic function was observed. CONCLUSIONS [...] In patients with left ventricular dysfunction long term improvement of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function was seen after ablation of the atrioventricular junction for rate control of atrial fibrillation. This procedure had no adverse effects on normal left ventricular function...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I'm {{introducing a}} program ARosem, with witch a optimal {{range of a}} green wave can be determined. I’m comparing it with a calculation of linear programming with an Excel and with a program Synchro. I also describe in detail how the program operates. For the comparison between programs I choose two road systems; the main street through the town Šentjur, named Ulica Dušana Kvedra, wich is quite simple road system, because it only has three crossroads with semaphores, and the most burdened road through the city Celje, named Mariborska ulica, that continues in Aškerceva ulica. This road system has 14 crossroads with semaphores in the distance of 3130 meters. Because of its complexity {{and the needs of}} the program I have split the problem on three parts that I joint at an end. I optimized these two road systems with the program ARosem and compared results for the same system with results, given by linear programming with Excel and program Synchro. With the comparison of the results I have determined, that the program ARosem is more appropriate for resolving smaller systems of crossroads with semaphores, since resolving larger road systems would require additional program upgrade, like adding vehicle acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>times</b> into the equation...|$|R

The artist uses small objects that compose the space of the gallery in installations that suggest the <b>deceleration</b> of <b>time,</b> the immersion of the spectator and foments the debate about the potency of things as an invitation to the approach and the intimacy.
