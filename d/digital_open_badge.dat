They can be stored in various online environments, including the Mozilla 'Backpack' and social media platforms. <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> have been used to evidence informal learning, professional development, community and voluntary work. This study is part of an ongoing project at a UK Higher Education Institution (HEI) to evaluate the potential of awarding <b>Digital</b> <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> in different contexts across the institution. It was decided to trial <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> on a programme run by Learning Development staff in the Library to support high achieving students, acknowledging and rewarding soft-skills acquired as part of the programme. Central {{to the success of the}} scheme was ‘buy-in’ from the students themselves; in order that the <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> had meaning and value to the recipients, a Participatory Design approach was adopted to engage students in the development process. Participatory Design is an iterative methodology that 'attempts to examine the tacit, invisible aspects of human activity' (Spinuzzi, 2005, p. 164) and incorporates them into co-produced systems. Soft-skills are an important complement to formal education in the 21 st Century workplace (Devedžić et al., 2015). Measuring and rewarding ‘soft-skills’ such as; critical thinking, communication, leadership and team-working, has proved problematic in the past. Key objectives were to establish a set of soft-skills metrics and, a sustainable approach to acknowledging the acquisition of those skills. This presentation will discuss the outcomes from the study, including an assessment of the sustainability of <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> as a mechanism for rewarding soft-skills acquisition in an informal setting...|$|R
40|$|For {{several decades}} {{members of the}} American Evaluation Association have {{discussed}} and disputed the issue of evaluator certification. Our past inability {{to agree on a}} certification solution may have been partially caused by the weaknesses of traditional certification systems, which rely on candidates obtaining a degree and completing a comprehensive exam. In this article we propose a certification system based on <b>digital</b> <b>open</b> <b>badges.</b> The <b>open</b> <b>badge</b> framework uses a top-down design to structure and understand the certification process as micro-certification units. These types of systems are adaptable and clearly communicate the evidence of knowledge, skill, and experience represented by the credential. The potential benefits of using an <b>open</b> <b>badge</b> infrastructure make this an enticing option and viable solution for the AEA to establish policy and practice regarding an efficient, rigorous and credible way to certify evaluators.

40|$|<b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> is an <b>open</b> {{source code}} concept {{developed}} by the Mozilla Foundation to identify the learner's knowledge and skills and to display them in a modern way. Although the concept was originally meant to display informal learning, {{it can also be}} applied to formal education. Indicating competences electronically makes it possible to display competences for which traditional certificates are unsuitable. It also enables completely new features such as a restricted validity period for a certificate. The <b>Open</b> <b>Badge</b> concept also can make education marketing more effective, and it might be thought as a future solution for identifying competences acquired earlier when moving from one study level to another. The Master Studies in Mathematical Information Technology at the Kokkola University Consortium Chydenius participates in the <b>Open</b> <b>Badge</b> Factory project consortium launched in 2014. The consortium is developing an application that will enable the creation, management and issuance of skill badges in accordance with the <b>Open</b> <b>Badge</b> concept.

40|$|It can be {{difficult}} to gain recognition for skills and experience acquired in informal as well as some formal settings. To solve this, Mozilla developed a credential-issuing platform for what they call <b>Open</b> <b>Badges.</b> Mozilla (n. d.) explained that “Badges provide a way for learners to get recognition for [skills gained in these settings], and display them to potential employers, schools, colleagues and their community ” (Mozilla, n. d.). <b>Open</b> <b>badges</b> are an example of a disruptive innovation. Christensen, Horn, and Johnson (2011) explained that disruptive innovations are products that are able to satisfy the need of an untapped market that was not currently being served by the more established and costly products. <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> are marketed towards the non-consumption areas of education. For example, <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> reward the informal acquisition of skills and achievements that are not being recognized in today’s formal educational system. Mozilla uses <b>open</b> <b>badges</b> on their webmaker. org site. The early design of their badges was a cumulative system in which badge “constellations ” would be formed.

In addition, widespread initiatives such as Mozilla’s <b>Open</b> <b>Badge</b> Framework expand {{the potential of}} badging {{into the realm of}} open education. In this paper, we explicate the concept of <b>open</b> <b>badges.</b> We highlight some of the ways that researchers have examined badges as part of educational practice and also highlight the different definitions of open-ness that are employed in popular and scholarly thought. By considering badges from three different perspectives (motivation, pedagogy, and credential) and the concept of openness from three different perspectives (production, access and appropriation) we develop a framework to consider the tensions where these competing conceptions meet. This explication illuminates how the ideas of <b>open</b> and <b>badges</b> intersect, and clarifies situations where these concepts come into direct conflict or mutually enhance each other.

50|$|Online or digital badges are not {{dissimilar}} to {{the concept}} of the Europass CV. <b>Open</b> <b>badges</b> do however challenge the existing practices in a more radical manner, in that the process is much more decentralized and removed from the traditional quality assurance bodies:A digital badge is an online representation of a skill you’ve learned. <b>Open</b> <b>Badges</b> take that concept one step further, and allows you to verify your skills, interests and achievements through credible organizations. And because the system is based on an open standard, you can combine multiple badges from different issuers to tell the complete story of your achievements - both online and off. Display your badges wherever you want them on the web, and share them for employment, education or lifelong learning.A key criticism of <b>open</b> <b>badges,</b> such as those developed by Mozilla, is that they lack a credible quality assurance component.

40|$|Open online {{learning}} courses such as cMOOCs and xMOOCs differ from conventional courses yet it remains uncertain how, and if, existing common yet costly practices associated with teacher-driven formative and summative assessment strategies {{can be made}} to work in this new context. For courses that carry no charge for registration or participation, authors of open online courses have to consider alternative approaches to engaging, motivating and sustaining study and for helping participants manage, plan and demonstrate their own learning. One such approach is that of <b>open</b> <b>badges</b> or similar such visual public symbols that communicate to others a particular quality, achievement or affiliation possessed by the owner. This paper reports the role, reception and use of <b>open</b> <b>badges</b> in two ‘massive’ open online courses delivered in 2013 with attention to varied functions of badges and the a distinction between formative and summative applications.
