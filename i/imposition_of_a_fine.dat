Detention Officer [...] Adam Stoddard was subsequently found in contempt-of-court for violating attorney-client privilege, {{and ordered to}} hold a press conference, to publicly apologize for his actions. [...] On the deadline set by the court, Detention Officer Stoddard, under orders from Sheriff Joe Arpaio, declined to apologize and was jailed. Arpaio argued that only he could order his Detention Officers actions and the court had no authority to enforce any action against his officer, a position that the Appeals Court rejected in Stoddard's appeal. The Appeals Court did order that Judge Donahoe's order to make an apology be stricken and replaced with a fine.

5000|$|Recent trends {{set by the}} ECJ’s {{case law}} {{concerning}} Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights, as seen in Case C-389/10 P KME, Case C-386/10 P Chalkor and the ECtHR Case Menarini, have been also been followed by the EFTA Court in Case E-15/10 Posten Norge AS v EFTA Surveillance Authority (better known as Norway Post). The Court upheld a decision by ESA finding that Norway Post had abused its dominant position {{in the market for}} business-to-consumer parcel services with over-the-counter delivery in Norway by pursuing an exclusivity strategy with preferential treatment when establishing and maintaining its Postin-Shop network. The facts of the case were as follows. In 2000 and 2001, Norway Post concluded framework agreements with several undertakings with a view to establish its Post-in-Shop network. Certain agreements specifically excluded competitors in the market for business-to-consumer parcel services from access to any of the outlets in these chains, while others guaranteed Norway Post exclusivity in the outlets which hosted a Post-in-Shop. Due to these exclusivity obligations, once the main roll-out of the Post-in-Shop concept had been implemented towards the end of 2003, Norway Post’s competitors were foreclosed from approximately 50% of all outlets belonging to grocery store, kiosk and petrol station chains in Norway. Furthermore, from 2004 to 2006, Norway Post negotiated preference status questions with its partners for the period subsequent to the expiry of those agreements in 2006. While Norway Post did not actively link the negotiations on preference status with the exclusivity obligations, it did not announce to its partners that it would not maintain such clauses in future cooperation agreements. In its judgment, the Court held that the proceedings, which had led to the <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> substantial <b>fine</b> on the applicant, as <b>a</b> matter <b>of</b> principle, must respect the guarantees for criminal proceedings enshrined in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In particular, the right to a fair trial requires that the Court must be able to quash in all respects, on questions of fact and of law, the challenged decision. Furthermore, it follows from the principle of the presumption of innocence that the undertaking to which the decision finding an infringement was addressed must be given the benefit <b>of</b> the doubt. <b>As</b> a consequence, the Court rejected ESA’s submission that its review of complex economic assessments by ESA would be limited to a “manifest error” standard. In substance, the Court upheld ESA’s assessment of Norway Post’s conduct. The Court dismissed Norway Post’s arguments that the exclusivity clauses were objectively necessary for the efficient implementation of the Post-in-Shop concept.|$|R
40|$|The Competition Act 89 of 1998 (Competition Act), {{contains}} merger review {{provisions that}} establish a mandatory merger filing regime for merger transactions {{that meet the}} statutory definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> merger {{as well as the}} prescribed thresholds for notification. 1 The mandatory merger requirements are contained in section 13 (1) (b) and section 13 A(3), of the Competition Act. These sections prohibit any party from implementing a merger without the approval of the respective competition authority. Section 13 and 13 A read with 59 (1) (d) (vi) grants the Competition Tribunal (Tribunal), a competition regulator that is established in terms of section 26 (1) of the Act, the power to impose <b>an</b> administrative <b>fine</b> on the parties that contravene the provisions of sections 13 and 13 A. Section 59 (2) reads, An administrative penalty imposed in terms of subsection (1) may not exceed 10 % of the firm s annual turnover in the Republic and its exports from the Republic during the firm s preceding financial year. The prescribed administrative fine {{is the same as the}} fine that the Tribunal might impose on companies that are found guilty of engaging in prohibited practices contained in Chapter 2, which relates to, inter alia, cartel conduct 2 or abuse of dominance 3 or price discrimination. 4 By not making a distinction between the fines imposed for anti-competitive conduct under chapter 2, the Competition Act illustrates how important it is for merging companies to not implement the merger transaction without the approval of the competition authority. Despite the possibility of sanctions by the Tribunal and the <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maximum <b>fine</b> <b>of</b> 10 %, of the companies turnover of the previous financial year, the Competition Act does not provide a definition or <b>an</b> explanation <b>of</b> what implementation means. <b>A</b> definition <b>of</b> the term implementation is important for two reasons, firstly it helps the merging companies to avoid conduct that contravenes section 13 and 13 A(3) and secondly, it ensures that the competition authorities are able to effectively use merger review to prevent conduct that facilitates or creates anti-competitive markets. The question that this dissertation seeks to answer is, what does implementation means for purpose of merger review? This dissertation considered the merger review provisions that are applied in the European Union s (EU) legislations and the case law of the European Commission (EU) to find out how the term implementation has been defined in the EU. <b>A</b> comparison <b>of</b> the EC merger control regime and the South African merger control regime assisted to identify possible similarities and differences that might assist to find the definition of the tern implementation. This dissertation identified factors, in the considered EU decisions, which are important for merger review in the South African context as these factors assist to understand how the merging companies might avoid contravening the South African Competition Act in the context <b>of</b> <b>a</b> merger. The factors identified in the EU decisions include, inter alia, merger agreement, control, jurisdiction and effects in South Africa. Although these factors are not exhaustive, the competition authorities need to consider all factors together when determining what implementation means. When applying the above factors to South African merger review it can be concluded that, implementation for purpose of merger review entails the enforcement of the terms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> merger agreement or terms of reference of the merger agreement, to the extent that such conduct constitute control either by way of majority shares or by way of influencing the business of the company being acquired. The enforcement of such merger agreement terms must take place in South Africa and do not necessarily need to have any direct effects on competition.

30|$|As {{the most}} {{effective}} preventive measures engine drivers considered fencing, followed by information campaigns, prohibitive signs, <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> and building an underpass or overpass.

The engine drivers also proposed information campaigns in the local papers and on radio and television, and placing fact sheets about the danger of trespassing close to railway tracks. Furthermore, the police should also make occasional enforcement campaigns at sites where trespassing occurs frequently. During those campaigns they should impose fines that are big enough to act as effective deterrents.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{the question of whether}} women and men are sentenced differently for similar delicts. The study sample consisted of 40 males and 40 females, matched on the basis of various key data (see below), partially mentally ill lawbreaker, who were examined at the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry of the Charité Berlin. The investigation period covered the years 1988 to 2007. The overall outcome of this work is that in terms of sentencing, no significant differences regarding the acquittal, the termination of the proceedings, the <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> (although the amount was not included) or a prison sentence on probation have been detected. However, men were significantly more often sentenced to prison without parole than women. Despite an apparent trend, at high standard deviation, we could find {{no significant difference between the}} study groups in relation to the total period of the ordered imprisonment. Another result of this investigation is a trend in the order of the measure, which was spoken out three times more common among women. Another significant difference was the residence during the assessment by the psychiatric or psychological expert. A third of men and one fifth of women were at that time in prison, in freedom there were one quarter of women and only one tenth of men. To avoid or minimize disturbances, the attention was paid in this work that essential factors such as age, type of the delict, previous criminal record, psychiatric diagnosis, psychosocial situation of the subjects were comparable. The variables such as the exact circumstances of the offense, preparation and behavior after the crime as well as motives of the perpetrator could not be considered in this work. Finally, it should be noted that one possible reason for the found difference is that no exact match could be made in the main diagnoses of the two study groups. More frequent order of imprisonment without parole, and more frequent placement in prison could be explained by it. In one third of women, a mood disorder was diagnosed so that possibly that was the reason why they were placed in the psychiatric hospital in accordance to § 63 StGB. Considering the present results, the research question whether women are treated differently than men in court, cannot be clearly affirmed. The local findings rather speak that men and women with similar crimes and similar criminal history are largely judged equal in the court...|$|E
