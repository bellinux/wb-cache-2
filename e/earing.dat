40|$|We propose an <b>ear</b> {{recognition}} {{system based}} on 2 D <b>ear</b> images which includes three stages: <b>ear</b> enrollment, feature extraction, and <b>ear</b> recognition. <b>Ear</b> enrollment includes <b>ear</b> detection and <b>ear</b> normalization. The <b>ear</b> detection approach based on improved Adaboost algorithm detects the <b>ear</b> part under complex background using two steps: offline cascaded classifier training and online <b>ear</b> detection. Then Active Shape Model is applied to segment the <b>ear</b> part and normalize all the <b>ear</b> images to the same size. For its eminent characteristics in spatial local feature extraction and orientation selection, Gabor filter based <b>ear</b> feature extraction is presented in this paper. Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) is then applied for dimension reduction of the high-dimensional Gabor features. Finally distance based classifier is applied for <b>ear</b> recognition. Experimental results of <b>ear</b> recognition on two datasets (USTB and UND datasets) {{and the performance of}} the <b>ear</b> authentication system show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

60|$|There {{was a deep}} settled air of authority, in {{the manner}} with which this tardy answer was given, that did not fail of its impression. <b>Earing</b> recoiled a step, with a {{submissive}} manner, and affected to be lost in consulting the driving masses of the clouds; then, summoning his resolution, he attempted to renew the attack in a different quarter.|$|E
60|$|It {{would have}} {{exceeded}} the peaceful and submissive temperament of the honest <b>Earing,</b> to have delayed any longer.

5000|$|Historically, <b>ear</b> {{cropping}} {{has been}} advocated {{as a health}} benefit for certain breeds with long, hanging <b>ears.</b> There {{is some evidence that}} dogs with standing <b>ears</b> may suffer from fewer <b>ear</b> infections than dogs with hanging <b>ears.</b> It has also been hypothesized that standing <b>ears</b> are less prone to damage and subsequent medical complications, especially in working dogs. Some claim that cropped <b>ears</b> enhance Boxers' hearing. [...] Long, hanging <b>ears</b> can not function the same way as erect <b>ears</b> which can swivel toward a sound source. The erect shape directs sound waves into the <b>ear</b> canal and additionally amplifies the sound slightly. Long, hanging pinnae also impose a physical barrier to sound waves entering the <b>ear</b> canal.|$|R
5|$|The human <b>ear</b> {{consists}} of three parts—the outer <b>ear,</b> middle <b>ear</b> and inner <b>ear.</b> The <b>ear</b> canal of the outer <b>ear</b> is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity of the middle <b>ear</b> by the eardrum. The middle <b>ear</b> contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and {{is connected to the}} throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner <b>ear</b> contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|R
40|$|Path {{analysis}} {{appears to}} be the best method in biological and agronomic studies to determine the major selection criteria. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate path coefficients both direct and indirect, for sweet corn. The research was carried out during 2003 and 2004 in Sanliurfa, Southeastern Turkey. Ten sweet corn genotypes were used as the crop materials. Fresh <b>ear</b> yield was statistically significant and positively correlated with single <b>ear</b> weight, <b>ear</b> length and <b>ear</b> diameter. <b>Ear</b> length gave a highest direct positive effect on fresh <b>ear</b> yield, followed by single <b>ear</b> weight. Plant height and stem diameter had negative direct effect on fresh <b>ear</b> yield. Direct effects of <b>ear</b> length, single <b>ear</b> weight, plant height and stem diameter on fresh <b>ear</b> yield were 42. 3 %, 31. 3 %, 31. 0 % and 17. 7 %, respectively. Path analyses revealed that the <b>ear</b> length and single <b>ear</b> weight as the primary; <b>ear</b> diameter, kernel number of <b>ear</b> and leaf number as the secondary characteristics that can be taken into consideration as the important yield components and selection criteria for sweet corn...|$|R

60|$|A single blow sufficed for the {{discharge}} of the momentary act. Extended to the utmost powers of endurance, by the vast weight it upheld, the lanyard struck by <b>Earing</b> no sooner parted, than each of its fellows snapped in succession, leaving the mast dependant on itself alone {{for the support of}} all its ponderous and complicated hamper. The cracking of the wood came next; and then the rigging fell, like a tree that had been sapped at its foundation, the little distance that still existed between it and the sea.|$|E
60|$|That the Israelites {{used the}} Luni-solar year is beyond question. Their months began {{with their new}} Moons. Their first month was called Abib, from the <b>earing</b> of Corn in that month. Their Passover was kept upon the fourteenth day of the first month, the Moon being then in the full: and if the Corn was not then ripe enough for {{offering}} the first Fruits, the Festival was put off, by adding an intercalary month {{to the end of}} the year; and the harvest was got in before the Pentecost, and the other Fruits gathered before the Feast of the seventh month.|$|E
25|$|In graph theory, an <b>ear</b> of an {{undirected graph}} G is a path P {{where the two}} {{endpoints}} of the path may coincide, but where otherwise no repetition of edges or vertices is allowed, so every internal vertex of P has degree two in P.

60|$|There was {{certainly}} enough, in the desperate manner with which Wilder pressed the canvas on the vessel, to excite distrust, either of his intentions or judgment, in {{the opinions of}} men less influenced by superstition than those it was now his lot to command. It had long been apparent to <b>Earing,</b> and his more ignorant, and consequently more obstinate, brother officer, that their young superior had the same desire {{to escape from the}} spectral-looking ship, which so strangely followed their movements, as they had themselves. They only differed in the mode; but this difference was so very material, that the two mates consulted together apart, and then <b>Earing,</b> something stimulated by the hardy opinions of his coadjutor, approached his Commander, with the determination of delivering the results of their united judgments, with that sort of directness which he thought the occasion now demanded. But there was that in the steady eye and imposing mien of Wilder, that caused him to touch on the dangerous subject with a discretion and circumlocution that were a little remarkable for the individual. He stood watching the effect of the sail recently spread for several minutes, before he even presumed to open his mouth. But a terrible encounter, between the vessel and a wave that lifted its angry crest apparently some dozen feet above the approaching bows, gave him courage to proceed, by admonishing him afresh of the danger of continuing silent.|$|E
60|$|It {{would have}} been {{difficult}} for either of the two malcontents to have given a very satisfactory answer to this question. Both were secretly goaded by mysterious and superstitious apprehensions, that were powerfully aided by the more real and intelligible aspect of the night; but neither had so far for gotten his manhood, and his professional pride, as to lay bare the full extent of his own weakness, at a moment when he was liable to be called upon for the exhibition of qualities of a far more positive and determined character. Still, the feeling that was uppermost betrayed itself in the reply of <b>Earing,</b> though in an indirect and covert manner.|$|E
60|$|<b>Earing</b> faced his Commander in silence, {{perfectly}} {{conscious that}} {{nothing he could}} utter contained an argument like this. The seamen no longer hesitated to mutter their disapprobation aloud, and many a prophetic opinion was ventured concerning the consequences of such reckless risks. To all this Wilder turned a deaf or an insensible ear. Firm in his own secret purpose, he would have braved a greater hazard to accomplish his object. But a distinct though smothered shriek, from {{the stern of the}} vessel, reminded him of the fears of others. Turning quickly on his heel, he approached the still trembling Gertrude and her governess, who had both been, throughout the whole of those long and tedious hours, inobtrusive but deeply interested, observers of his smallest movements.|$|E
