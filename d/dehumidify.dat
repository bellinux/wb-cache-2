5|$|By early 1997, {{after almost}} two decades of activity, the only repairs {{completed}} were phase one of the air ventilation system to <b>dehumidify</b> the hollow base, the drainage pipes and a new inner roof. Plans now included the erection of a temporary two-story metal building to protect all but the giant Father Time from the harsh winters and to facilitate year-round repair; the reinforcement of corroded steel interior portions; the replacement of inconsistent patches; the substitution of engineered spacing for natural cracks, and finally, hand-brushed concrete recoating. The temporary building was budgeted at $270,000; the city spent a total of $450,000 on repairs approved by the Park District that year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Desorption isotherms {{for white}} {{mulberry}} leaves have been measured. A non-linear regression program {{was used to}} fit four moisture sorption isotherm models to the experimental data. The Modified Henderson and Modified Halsey models gave the best fit for X e = f(RH e, T) and RH e = f(X e, T),respectively. Tray and heat pump <b>dehumidified</b> drying experiments of white mulberry leaves were conducted. The convective drying curves of tray and heat pump <b>dehumidified</b> drying for white mulberry leaves were determined and fitted by four models. The Modified Page model was found more effective. The drying constant was fitted to drying air temperature using Arrhenius model. Effective moisture diffusivities were determined using the drying data. 2 2 These values were in the range 1. 032 E- 10 to 2. 611 E- 10 m /s and 1. 496 E- 10 to 2. 705 E- 10 m /s for tray and heat pump <b>dehumidified</b> drying respectively.

25|$|If the PTCS cannot keep up {{with the}} heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) {{maintains}} the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and <b>dehumidify</b> the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid ammonia loop that can withstand the much lower temperature of space, and is circulated through radiators to remove the heat. The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including Kibō and Columbus, as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses. It can reject up to 70kW. This is much more than the 14kW of the Early External Active Thermal Control System (EEATCS) via the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), which was launched on STS-105 and installed onto the P6 Truss.|$|E

40|$|Applying <b>dehumidified</b> air is {{considered}} {{as an option}} to retain quality in carrageenan drying. This work concerns the effects of operational temperature, air velocity, and carrageenan thickness {{on the progress of}} drying and product quality when using <b>dehumidified</b> air. Final product quality and progress of drying were measured by experiments, and a two dimensional model was developed to analyze progress of drying for the different operational conditions. The experimental and modeling results showed that air dehumidification with zeolite reduces the drying time the most at low temperatures. Under these conditions the carrageenan qualities whiteness and gel strength are the least affected by the exposure to the drying temperature. The drying time is the shortest at 120 °C, but at this temperature the carrageenan quality degrades the most and is not be improved by air dehumidification.

50|$|Chilled {{water is}} used to cool and <b>dehumidify</b> air in mid- to large-size commercial, industrial, and {{institutional}} (CII) facilities. Water chillers can be water-cooled, air-cooled, or evaporatively cooled. Water-cooled chillers incorporate the use of cooling towers which improve the chillers' thermodynamic effectiveness as compared to air-cooled chillers. This is due to heat rejection {{at or near the}} air's wet-bulb temperature rather than the higher, sometimes much higher, dry-bulb temperature.

40|$|Most {{empirical}} {{correlations for}} determining the fin-side heat and mass-transfer coefficients are applicable to cooling and <b>dehumidifying</b> coils with flat-plate fins only. There are very few heat-transfer data for corrugated-plate fins in the open literature. Among those available, the most comprehensive set of experimental data was that contributed by Beecher and Pagan. On that basis, they, and later Webb, derived heat-transfer correlations for both corrugated and flat fin surfaces. However, these correlations are inadequate for modelling cooling and <b>dehumidifying</b> coils because Beecher and Pagan's data are restricted to dry fins and to a limited range of coil configurations. The paper describes a steady-state model for chilled-water cooling and <b>dehumidifying</b> coils with corrugated-plate fins. This model was developed {{on the basis of}} McQuiston's correlations for flat-plate fins but included the use of Webb's correlations to determine a correction factor to make the flat-fin coefficients applicable to coils with corrugated fins. Comparison of the model predictions with manufacturers' data showed that acceptable predictions of sensible and latent heat-transfer rates can be obtained by applying the correction to the sensible heat-transfer coefficient only. The uncertainty in verification of coil model predictions by comparison with manufacturers' data has also been addressed. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
