In 2015 the company announced an investment of approximately $13.5 Million from ROTH Capital Partners, bringing Revel's Series C round to approximately $110 Million.

Data was collected from a nationwide survey of 72 venture capitalists. The results show that venture capitalists having a non-business 2 ̆ 2 background invest in earlier stages of the firm. require a shorter payback period and make more <b>follow-up</b> <b>investments</b> than business background venture capitalists.

40|$|This paper compares optimal {{financial}} {{contracts with}} centralized and decentralized firms. Under centralized contracting headquarters raises funds {{on behalf of}} multiple projects and then allocates the funds on the firm’s internal capital market. Under decentralized contracting each project raises funds separately on the external capital market. The benefit of centralization is that headquarters can use excess liquidity from high-cash flow projects to buy continuation rights for low cash-flow projects. This allows headquarters to make greater repayments to investors, which eases financing constraints ex ante. The cost is that headquarters may pool cash flows from several projects, thereby accumulate internal funds, and make <b>follow-up</b> <b>investments</b> without having {{to return to the}} capital market. Absent any capital market discipline, however, it is more difficult for investors t...|$|R
40|$|The {{initial cost}} of capital of a foreign subsidiary, financed by its parent from abroad, is {{dependent}} on repatriation taxes and this also applies to all <b>follow-up</b> <b>investments</b> financed from marginal foreign profits, representing the required return on the initial investment. Only investments financed from intra-marginal foreign profits are independent of repatriation taxes, but their {{cost of capital}} depends inversely on the dividend tax of the home-country parent?s owners. We calibrate the cost of capital formulae to the Estonian and Finnish parameters of taxing international investment income. The calculations show that Estonian subsidiaries, which pay no tax on undistributed profits but a corporate dividend tax, offer tax benefits to their parents {{only in terms of}} intra-marginal profits. Direct investment, tax incentives, corporate tax...|$|R
50|$|The sales {{division}} {{is responsible for}} commercially selling real estate {{that the federal government}} no longer requires. This includes residential property, commercial property, land, military installations and culturally significant buildings. The Institute for Federal Real Estate considers the division's specialty to be the marketing of military areas that have been used by the armed forces of Germany (Bundeswehr) and foreign military forces. The division's long-term aim is to dispose about 30,000 properties, by selling around 3,000 annually. The properties sold are often subject to <b>follow-up</b> <b>investments,</b> such as converting former military areas into residential estates and recreational facilities. The Institute for Federal Real Estate does not by itself engage in such real estate development, but rather works together with state authorities, local authorities and investors. The revenue generated by the sales division accounts for around 50% of the total revenue generated.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{literature}} on the investment decision-making of business angels. Using insights from entrepreneurial learning theory we explore whether angels learn from experience, how they learn and what they learn. These issues are addressed using Verbal Protocol Analysis, a methodology for examining decision-making in real time, on three groups of business angels with differing levels of <b>investment</b> experience, and <b>follow-up</b> interviews with these angels. This reveals some differences in the speed of decision making and the emphasis given to various investment criteria. The relatively limited extent of the contrasts can be attributed to two factors. First, angel learning has been in terms of their approach to investing rather than fundamentals. Second, this learning has had more effect on how they conduct their due diligence on opportunities that pass their initial screening than on the initial screening stage itself. Learning from other investors is important...|$|R
40|$|We study optimal ¢nancial {{contracting}} for centralized and decentralized ¢rms. Under centralized contracting, headquarters raises {{funds on}} behalf of multiple projects. Under decentralized contracting, each project raises funds separately on the external capital market. The bene¢t of centralization is that headquarters can use excess liquidity from high cash-£ow projects to buy continuation rights for low cash-£ow projects. The cost is that headquarters may pool cash £ows from several projects and self-¢nance <b>follow-up</b> <b>investments</b> without having {{to return to the}} capital market. Absent any capital market discipline, it is more di⁄cult to force headquarters to make repayments, which tightens ¢nancing constraints ex ante. Cross-sectionally, our model implies that conglomerates should have a lower average productivity than stand-alone ¢rms. BEGINNING WITH FAZZARI, HUBBARD, AND PETERSEN (1988), several studies document that the investment behavior of ¢rms is a¡ected by ¢nancing constraints. 1 In this paper, we explore the relation between ¢nancing constraints and organizationa...|$|R
40|$|Reciprocity {{is common}} in {{economic}} and social domains, {{and it has been}} widely documented in the laboratory. While positive and negative reciprocity are observed in investment and ultimatum games, respectively, prior laboratory studies often neglect the effect of time delays that are common in real-world interactions. This research investigates the effect of time delays on reciprocity in the investment and ultimatum games. We manipulate the time delay after second movers have been informed about the first movers’ decisions. We find that a delay is correlated with fewer rejections in the ultimatum game, but we find no effect of delays in the <b>investment</b> game. A <b>follow-up</b> study explores some of the processes that occur during time delay in the ultimatum game. We find delays correlated to increased reported feelings of satisfaction and decreased reported feelings of disappointment. Increased satisfaction is correlated to an increased probability of rejection, while disappointment has a more complex relationship to the probability of rejection...|$|R
40|$|Special {{events are}} {{important}} to many nonprofit organizations because they help raise awareness of a cause and help cultivate relationships with donors and potential donors. Events {{tend to be more}} costly than other fundraising strategies in terms of return on investment, but they are often incorporated into overall fundraising strategy because they provide visibility for the organization and opportunities to involve people in its activities. The literature on special events is largely focused on anecdotal descriptions of how-to's for producing events [...] budgets, checklists, timelines, descriptions of types of events, formats, use of media for events, managing volunteer involvement, securing in-kind support, and evaluation of the event. What is missing from the literature is benchmarking research that would help a nonprofit determine whether an event is appropriate considering its circumstances, how its event results compare with those of other like organizations, and effective ways to follow up with constituents, media and potential donors after the event. In this study, the AFP Foundation for Philanthropy collected information on event planning and management to enable nonprofit managers to compare their events with those of other organizations by type, size, region, metropolitan area size, and number and types of events per year. The study results provide a tool to help nonprofits make informed decisions about whether to invest in an event, how to plan a successful event(s), steps to maximize return on <b>investment,</b> and <b>follow-up</b> activities to help turn event attendees into donors. Study results will also be used by the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP) to plan formats for presenting event planning information to its members...|$|R
40|$|We model an {{investment}} in a foreign subsidiary, the outside finance to which is injected by its parent company from abroad. Sinn’s (1993) initial “underinvestment” problem due to taxes on repatriated dividends is argued to also concern all <b>follow-up</b> <b>investments</b> of the subsidiary financed from its marginal profits that represent the required return on the initial investment. The dividend tax capitalization hypothesis in the international context, or the Sinn-Hartman neutrality theorem, is valid only if the initial investment generates intra-marginal profits and concerns their reinvestment, the returns of which are repatriated dividends. The results reveal that the ownership structure of the parent and the consequent tax preference for dividends affect foreign source intra-marginal profits differently from domestic source ones. In particular, the cost of capital for foreign intra-marginal profits is inversely affected by the home-country dividend tax. We calibrate the cost of capital formulae to the parameter values of the Estonian and Finnish systems of taxing international investment income. The calculations show that the Estonian subsidiaries, paying no tax on undistributed profits but a corporate dividend tax, offer tax benefits to their parent companies only by their intra-marginal profits...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} extent to which Chinese {{government}} support of foreign direct investment (FDI) projects and host country institutional environments interact with prior entry experience by Chinese firms, and how this interrelationship affects FDI undertaken by Chinese firms. We hypothesize that home country government support and well-established host country institutions enhance organizational capabilities to take risks in FDI. As such, they reduce the need to accumulate experiential knowledge and capabilities relating to entering host countries based on prior entry experience in a particular country when undertaking <b>follow-up</b> <b>investment</b> projects. Using a unique, hand-collected panel data set of Chinese publicly listed firms during 2002 – 2009, we find that home government support and well-developed host country institutions reduce the importance of prior entry experience and significantly increase the likelihood of FDI entry into a host country. Further, from our subsample analyses we identify differences between entering developed and developing host countries in terms of the impact of home country government support and quality of host country institutions. Our findings help explain the puzzle concerning why emerging economy firms have rapidly internationalized {{in a short period of}} time and do not follow the pattern predicted by classical IB theories...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing concern}} exists {{regarding}} {{the efficiency of}} public resources spent in transport infrastructures. In this paper, we measure the efficiency of seven highway projects in Portugal {{over the past decade}} by means of a data envelopment analysis and the Malmquist productivity and efficiency indices. We distinguish between technical and technological efficiency and find that most highways face a reduction over time in both types of efficiency. This reduction is mainly due to an increase in operating and maintenance costs, <b>follow-up</b> <b>investments,</b> and a decline in traffic. Some highways only experience a reduction in technological efficiency after a decrease in traffic. They compensate with cost controls and stable investments. While controlling for scale efficiencies, we find a lack of pure technical efficiency in highways that are not subject to a competitive environment, which produces a lack of incentives for better management. Not only does evidence exist of poor management {{due to a lack of}} competition, but the increased use of outsourcing also increases inefficiencies. The introduction of tolls and the outburst of the economic crisis in Portugal have substantially reduced traffic that further contributes to inefficiency. The local context, such as highways in low-income areas and rural regions with a lower traffic density, also affects highway performance...|$|R

The UK Commission's Employer Skills Survey is a biennial UK-wide individual establishment telephone survey, providing the most detailed picture of training, vacancies, skills gaps, and investment in training. The aims are to provide rigorous and robust intelligence on the UK labour market and the market for skills. The ESS sits alongside the Employer Perspectives Survey (EPS) to produce insights that complement each other and are run in alternate years. The focus of the Employer Perspectives Survey is primarily outward-looking, covering provision of and engagement with the wider skills system, whereas the Employer Skills Survey is inward-looking and measures the current skills position and skill needs of employers. The 2015 Employer Skills Survey had two facets: The core survey of circa 91, 000 establishments: covering business strategy, recruitment, retention, skills gaps, training and workforce development, and high performance working; The <b>Investment</b> in Training <b>follow-up</b> survey of circa 13, 000 establishments : covering the investment establishments make in training their staff. The 2015 survey is the third UK-wide skills survey. Further information {{can be found on}} the UKCES Employer Skills Survey webpage. Main Topics : Topics covered by this study include the following: establishment characteristics; recruitment and vacancies; demand for skills and skills gap; hard-to-fill vacancies; workforce development and training; skills utilisation and high performance working; business strategy and structure...|$|R
