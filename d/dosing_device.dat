Materials and Methods. Magnetic particles (d = 2, 8 mm) were treated with pluronic and injected into the cytoplasm of HEK- 293 cell line, expressing GFP. The surgery was made under general anesthesia. HEK- 293 containing magnetic particles were injected into the subretinal space of rabbit eyes (eyes 96, 48 rabbits) using original <b>dosing</b> <b>device.</b> In the experimental group (48 eyes, 24 rabbits) we fixed episcleral magnetic implant to hold cells in local place.

40|$|This {{research}} {{assessed the}} consumer {{acceptance of a}} recycled paper scoop versus the existing polystyrene (PS) scoop as a <b>dosing</b> <b>device</b> for synthetic powder laundry detergents. Specifically: (1) Were the consumers aware of and {{in agreement with the}} environmental benefits of a recycled paper scoop versus the current plastic scoop? (2) Did consumers consider a recycled paper scoop as an acceptable replacement for the current plastic measuring scoop? The implementation of a recycled paper scoop would reduce packaging waste by approximately 20 % by weight and a significant source reduction through decreased consumption of raw materials. Additionally, it would provide a substantial cost savings of approximately $ 30 M USD annually. The recycled paper scoop consisted of 50 % of post industrial (external) recycled fibres, 40 % of post consumer recycled fibres and 10 % of virgin fibres and internal waste sources. The 10 % virgin fibres and internal sources was used to help increase the board strength and improve printability. The TAPPI (1989) test methods were used in the selection of the paperboard grades in meeting the performance requirements of the paper scoop application. The results of the home performance test indicated that a recycled paper measuring scoop was not an acceptable replacement for the plastic measuring scoop. Although there were positive ratings on the recycled paper scoop, they related to generalities and environmental preference.

However, microfluidic systems having enhanced functionality, e. g. differential pressure sensors, <b>dosing</b> <b>devices</b> and pumps, require active components that include electrically driven actuators. Up to now, only piezo-cantilevers, electromagnetic and thermo-pneumatic actuators have been engineered for the LTCC integration [1 - 4]. Due to their specific properties, they are not suitable for all applications that require an actuator. Therefore, a review on actuators capable of being integrated in LTCC is given.

40|$|Binding of {{hydrophobic}} {{chemicals to}} colloids such as proteins or lipids {{is difficult to}} measure using classical microdialysis methods due to low aqueous concentrations, adsorption to dialysis membranes and test vessels, and slow kinetics of equilibration. Here we employed a three-phase partitioning system where silicone (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) serves as a third phase to determine partitioning between water and colloids and acts {{at the same time}} as a <b>dosing</b> <b>device</b> for hydrophobic chemicals. The applicability of this method was demonstrated with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Measured binding constants (KBSAw) for chlorpyrifos, methoxychlor, nonylphenol, and pyrene were in good agreement with an established quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR). A fifth compound, fluoxypyr-methyl-heptyl ester, was excluded from the analysis because of apparent abiotic degradation. The PDMS depletion method was then used to determine partition coefficients for test chemicals in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) liver S 9 fractions (KS 9 w) and blood plasma (Kbloodw). Measured KS 9 w and Kbloodw values were consistent with predictions obtained using a mass-balance model that employs the octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) as a surrogate for lipid partitioning and KBSAw to represent protein binding. For each compound, Kbloodw was substantially greater than KS 9 w, primarily because blood contains more lipid than liver S 9 fractions (1. 84 % of wet weight vs. 0. 051 %). Measured liver S 9 and blood plasma binding parameters were subsequently implemented in an in-vitro to in-vivo extrapolation model to link the in-vitro liver S 9 metabolic degradation assay to in-vivo metabolism in fish. Apparent volumes of distribution (Vd) calculated from the experimental data were similar to literature estimates. However, the calculated binding ratios (fu) used to relate in-vitro metabolic clearance to clearance by the intact liver were 10 to 100 times lower than values used in previous modeling efforts. Bioconcentration factors (BCF) predicted using the experimental binding data were substantially higher than predicted values obtained in earlier studies and correlated poorly with measured BCF values in fish. One possible explanation for this finding is that chemicals bound to proteins can desorb rapidly and thus contribute to metabolic turnover of the chemicals. This hypothesis remains to be investigated in future studies, ideally with chemicals of higher hydrophobicity. JRC. I. 2 -Validation of Alternative Method...|$|E

The distribution of the spray formulation takes place below the cover ventilator and the formed aerosol particles are evenly distributed in the exposure room through the ventilator flow and the turbulent fresh air flow. The atomization device is centrally introduced below the cover ventilator and/or in the immediate proximity to the swirl outlet. The spray formulation is supplied to a <b>dosing</b> <b>device</b> for adjusting a suitable liquid mass flow and subsequently fed back to the atomization device. The air volume flow Q through the exposure room is 600 - 2000 m 3 /h. The exposure room is operated with an air change rate of 1000 - 1600. The distribution of the aerosol leads to allergen concentration in the room air of the exposure room in the range of 0. 01 - 1 mu g/m 3. The allergen concentration in the room air of the exposure room is constantly kept with a maximum deviation of 20 % over a time period of 1 - 5 hours. An aerosol monitor and/or laser particle counter are introduced in the exposure room for determining the allergen concentration. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a device for carrying out an inhalative allergen provocation. USE - Method for producing inhalation atmosphere in an exposure room for inhalative allergen provocation (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method allows realistic simulation of environmental exposure, site of action in the respiratory tract and bioavailability, high flexibility with respect to the allergen or allergen spectrum to be examined and very good control of allergen spectrum, allergen concentration and particle size, and uses only a technical procedure for the generation and monitoring...|$|E

40|$|SummaryInability to use inhaler devices {{correctly}} is a {{major source}} of non-compliance in patients with asthma. The problem of coordinating dose release with inspiration seen with pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) is overcome by dry powder inhalers (DPIs), since they use inspiratory flow energy to carry the drug dose to the respiratory tract. The first DPIs were not popular because they were single <b>dose</b> <b>devices</b> and inconvenient to use. The introduction of multiple dose DPIs improved the image of the dry powder systems in the eyes of both the clinician and the patient. The continued development of DPIs has led to inhaler <b>devices</b> which include <b>dose</b> counters, are easy to use, are refillable and provide feedback to the patient on a correct inhalation. Criteria that may improve patient compliance with an inhaler include: correct use of the device by most patients; ease and convenience of <b>device</b> use; <b>dose</b> release even at low inspiratory flow rates; feedback of drug release which could instill confidence that the dose has been inhaled; cartridge refills and overall confidence in the device. The Novolizer® has all the desirable features listed above and is expected to improve compliance if prescribed for the large number of patients who cannot use the conventional pMDI or less efficient DPIs...|$|R
