40|$|Navigation in {{a static}} {{environment}} along straight paths without eye movements produces radial optic flow fields. A singularity called {{the focus of}} expansion (FoE) specifies the direction of travel (heading) of the observer. Cells in primate visual area MSTd respond to radial fields and are therefore thought to be heading-sensitive. Humans frequently shift their focus of attention while navigating, for example, depending on the favorable or threatening context of approaching independently moving objects. Recent neurophysiological {{studies show that the}} spatial tuning curves of primate MSTd neurons change based on the difference in visual angle between an attentional prime and the FoE. Moreover, the peak mean population activity in MSTd retreats linearly in time as the distance between the attentional prime and FoE increases. We present a dynamical neural circuit model that demonstrates the same linear temporal peak shift observed electrophysiologically. The model qualitatively matches the neuron tuning curves and population activation profiles. After model MT dynamically pools short-range motion, model MSTd incorporates recurrent competition between units tuned to different radial optic flow templates, and integrates attentional signals from model area FEF. In the model, population activity peaks occur when the recurrent competition is most active and uncertainty is greatest about the relative position of the FoE. The nature of attention, multiplicative or non-multiplicative, is largely irrelevant, so long as attention has a Gaussian-like profile. Using an appropriately tuned sigmoidal signal function to modulate recurrent feedback affords qualitative fits of deflections in the population activity that otherwise appear to be low-frequency noise. We predict that these <b>deflections</b> <b>mark</b> changes in the balance of attention between the priming and FoE locations...|$|R

Inflammation of the joint may be primary resulting from infection of the joint itself or may result from extension of neighboring infection. The clinical features of ankylosis are limited mouth opening, with no pain and joint sounds, and <b>marked</b> <b>deflection</b> of the mandible to the affected side.

25|$|Helena {{lies within}} the {{northern}} part of the Intermountain Seismic Belt (ISB). This area of relatively intense seismicity runs roughly north-south from northwestern Arizona, through Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming, before dying out in northwestern Montana. It shows a <b>marked</b> <b>deflection</b> to the northwest near Helena, where it intersects with the Lewis and Clark fault zone, a zone of older WNW-trending faults. The ISB is characterised by normal faulting of late Quaternary age, indicating active extensional tectonics, as recognised throughout the Basin and Range province to the south. The focal mechanism of the two largest earthquakes of the 1935 sequence are consistent with right lateral strike-slip faulting on faults similar in trend to two major mapped NW-SE faults, the Bald Butte and Helena Valley Faults.|$|R
30|$|MST {{is located}} below CCD (Berger et al. 1976); therefore, 14 C dating method {{cannot be used}} for these cores as they contain few calcium carbonates. Therefore, we used a PSV method {{that has not been}} {{previously}} used for dating the deep-sea turbidites. The measurement procedure and the PSV records and magnetic susceptibility results are based on Kanamatsu et al. (2017). Obvious peak and trough intervals on the graphs of paleomagnetic inclinations and declinations (PSV labels; “A”–“E” and “a”–“i” in Fig.  2) were correlated with those of a Holocene secular variation curve from Lake Biwa (Ali et al. 1999) to infer the age of the cores. Refer to Additional file 4 : Figure S 4, Additional file 5 : Table S 1, Additional file 6 : Table S 2 for more details. Generally, directional <b>deflections</b> are clearly <b>marked</b> in the turbidite layers in our profiles (Fig.  2). These deflections are likely related to coarse material intercalations. Thus, the intervals, which show larger deflections, may not indicate proper PSV records. Therefore, we made stratigraphic correlations without those data.|$|R
40|$|The American Academy of Orofacial Pain (AAOP) defines {{ankylosis}} of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) as a {{restriction of}} movements due to intracapsular fibrous adhesions, fibrous changes in capsular ligaments (fibrous-ankylosis) and osseous mass formation {{resulting in the}} fusion of the articular components (osseous-ankylosis). The clinical features of the fibrous-ankylosis are severely limited mouth-opening capacity (limited range of motion during the opening), usually no pain and no joint sounds, <b>marked</b> <b>deflection</b> to the affected side and marked limitation of movement to the contralateral side. A variety of factors may cause TMJ ankylosis, such as trauma, local and systemic inflammatory conditions, neoplasms and TMJ infection. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{is one of the}} systemic inflammatory conditions that affect the TMJ and can cause ankylosis.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the experimental tests {{carried out on}} two prestressed thin walled V-shaped elements, used {{over a period of}} 18 years as the roof of an industrial building and removed after having exhibited <b>marked</b> <b>deflections</b> and crack patterns. The experimental program, including material characterization,impact load and ultimate static load tests, is aimed at evaluating the actual load carrying capacity of the elements. The survey of the elements geometry, with special attention to imperfections, is presented; then results of the impact load test, namely the fundamental frequencies and modal shapes of free vibration, are reported. Successively, the results of static load tests up to failure are discussed. Due to the small thickness of the cross section walls, second order effects strongly interact with the global failure mechanism. The combination of dynamic impact and ultimate static load tests allowed the calibration of an accurate finite element model, accounting for both mechanical and geometrical nonlinearities, capable to predict the behaviour of the elements up to collapse and useful to design repairing and strengthening works...|$|R
500|$|Robben was inflicted {{with yet}} another injury in a match against Liverpool on 20 January 2007. Robben made his return in a 3–0 victory against Middlesbrough in February, driving in a shot that took a <b>deflection</b> past <b>Mark</b> Schwarzer for an own goal by Abel Xavier. He came on as a {{substitute}} for Claude Makélélé in the 2007 League Cup final against Arsenal and set up the winning goal for Didier Drogba. Robben scored a goal {{in the second round of}} the Champions League against Porto, which led to Chelsea winning the tie 3–2 on aggregate. At the end of March 2007, Robben underwent a knee operation after sustaining a knee injury upon returning from international duty that was expected to rule him out for at least four weeks. He only made two further appearances for Chelsea, both of which were as a substitute and both of which would prove to be key games for the club. His first appearance since returning from injury was against Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final second leg which went to penalties. Robben went on to have his penalty saved by Pepe Reina, and Chelsea ultimately lost. His final appearance for the club came against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup Final. Robben replaced Joe Cole at half-time, but was then substituted himself for Ashley Cole in extra time as Chelsea emerged victorious. Spanish club Real Madrid were interested in two of Chelsea's players. Then manager Bernd Schuster is said to have demanded Michael Ballack, while Real Madrid's then president Ramón Calderón was known to favour Robben. Robben said to reporters of Spanish newspaper AS, [...] "I do not know when a deal will be reached. I would like to send a message to the Madrid fans, but I can't until my future is sorted." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{preliminary}} study examining the effects of valley presence on airflow direction and focuses on valleys situated in areas of low relief. Wind tunnel experiments are used to visualise near-surface airflow over a series of models representing valleys oriented at different angles to mean airflow. Results indicate that the presence of a valley has no significant influence on airflow direction when the approach angle of the wind is perpendicular to the valley strike. However, any wind approach-angle less than 90 degrees is found to cause <b>marked</b> <b>deflection</b> of airflow to become more parallel to the valley. Analogies can be drawn between the surface streamlines recorded on the negative terrain of the valley models and those around positive terrain such as hills. A discussion of air pressure perturbation over both positive and negative terrain concludes that valley structures can {{have a significant effect on}} overlying synoptic windflow. The nature and magnitude of this effect is dependent upon a complex range of environmental parameters including valley morphometry, wind speed and the thermal stability of the airflow. The findings outlined have implications for the development of aeolian bedforms and processes of aeolian sedimentation in the vicinity of valleys...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{has been made}} of the electrical responses recorded on the surface and within the substance of the first sacral spinal segment when the contained motoneurons are excited by single and repeated antidromic ventral root volleys. A succession of negative deflections, designated in order of increasing latency m, i, b, d, has been found. Each of those deflections possesses some physiological property or properties to distinguish it from the remainder. Indicated by that fact is the conclusion that the successive deflections represent impulse conduction through successive parts of the motoneurons that differ in behavior, each from the others. Since the spinal cord constitutes a volume conductor the negative deflections are anteceded by a positive deflection at all points except that at which the axonal impulses first enter from the ventral root into the spinal cord. Frequently two or more negative deflections are recorded together in overlapping sequence, but for each deflection a region can be found in which the onset of that <b>deflection</b> <b>marks</b> the transition from prodromal positivity to negativity. Deflection m is characteristic of axonal spikes. Latent period is in keeping with known axonal conduction velocity. Refractory period is brief. The response represented by m is highly resistant to asphyxia. Maximal along the line of ventral root attachment and attenuating sharply therefrom, deflection m can be attributed only to axonal impulse conduction. Deflection i is encountered only within the cord, and is always associated with a deflection b. The i,b complex is recordable at loci immediately dorsal to regions from which m is recorded, and immediately ventral to points from which b is recorded in isolation from i. Except for its great sensitivity to asphyxia, deflection i has properties in common with those of m, but very different from those of b or d. To judge by properties i represents continuing axonal impulse conduction into a region, however, that is readily depolarized by asphyxia. Deflection b possesses a unique configuration in that the ascending limb is sloped progressively to the right indicating a sharp decrease in velocity of the antidromic impulses penetrating the b segment. A second antidromic volley will not conduct from i segment to b segment of the motoneurons unless separated from the first by nearly 1 msec. longer than is necessary for restimulation of axons. This value accords with somatic refractoriness determined by other means. Together with spatial considerations, the fact suggests that b represents antidromic invasion of cell bodies. Deflection d is ubiquitous, but in recordings from regions dorsal and lateral to the ventral horn, wherein an electrode is close to dendrites, but remote from other segments of motoneurons, d is the initial negative deflection. In latency d is variable to a degree that demands that it represent slow conduction through rather elongated structures. When associated with deflection b, deflection d may arise from the peak of b with the only notable discontinuity provided by the characteristically sloped rising phase of b. Deflection d records the occupation by antidromic impulses of the dendrites. Once dendrites have conducted a volley they will not again do so fully for some 120 msec. Embracing the several deflections, recorded impulse negativity in the motoneurons may endure for nearly 5 msec. When the axonal deflection m is recorded with minimal interference from somatic currents, it is followed by a reversal of sign to positivity that endures as long as impulse negativity can be traced elsewhere, demonstrating the existence of current flow from axons to somata as the latter are occupied by impulses. Note is taken of the fact that impulse conduction through motoneurons is followed by an interval, measurable to some 120 msec., during which after-currents flow. These currents denote the existence in parts of the intramedullary motoneurons of after-potentials the courses of which must differ {{in different parts of the}} neurons, otherwise nothing would be recorded. The location of sources and sinks is such as to indicate that a major fraction of the current flows between axons and somata. For approximately 45 msec. the direction of flow is from dendrites to axons. Thereafter, and for the remaining measurable duration, flow is from axons to dendrites...|$|R
40|$|The {{fatigue crack}} {{initiation}} and propagation characteristics of Friction Stir Welds (FSW) and 13 mm gauge 2024 -T 351 A 1 alloy have been studied. Two failure locations have been identified: outside the weld nugget region {{and over the}} nugget region. The study shows that when failure occurs outside the nugget, fatigue crack growth is essentially conventional (mode I dominated), with initiation from S-phase particles. For failures over the nugget region initiations were linked to coarse intermetallics associated with macroscopic discontinuities in the weld flow pattern; with subsequent crack growth being seen to follow {{the curve of the}} banded structure within the weld nuggets region. A variety of microstructural and micromechanical contributions to fatigue failure have been identified, including the roles of local matrix ageing characteristics, intermetallic particle size and distributions, local flow stress characteristics and the residual stress distributions. The effect of varying the welding parameters has also been studied in partial penetration 25 mm gauge 2024 -T 351 Al alloy. Again, two failure locations have been identified: outside the weld nugget region and over the nugget region. Outside the nugget exhibited essentially conventional (mode I dominated) crack growth, with initiation occurring at S-phase particles. Failure over the nugget only occurred in samples from the slower of the two welding speeds, initiation was identified with linear defects at, or just below, the surface. Again a variety of microstructural and micromechanical facts were identified as having an influence on the subsequent growth, in particular the <b>marked</b> <b>deflection</b> from a conventional mode I path. The failure location however did not appear to significantly alter fatigue lives. <br/...|$|R
40|$|In {{a typical}} mollusc, the shell {{is the most}} {{important}} defensive mechanism. But the shell does not protect the mollusc from all predators, and {{it is for this reason}} that secondary defensive mechanisms have evolved in many species. In some cases, these secondary mechanisms become more important than the shell as a means of protection from predators, and where this occurs selection may favour the reduction and even the total loss of the shell. The shell has been lost independently in each of the nine orders of the Opisthobranchia except the Thecosomata, and in the Sacoglossa and the Nudibranchia it may have been lost two or three times. In all of these cases where the shell-less or nudibranch condition has evolved, the animal must be adequately protected by defensive mechanisms other than the shell. This thesis studies the defensive mechanisms of a number of nudibranch molluscs. In the Sacoglossa there is a series of forms from the primitive Arthessa, with a well-developed defensive shell, through Oxynoandeuml; and Lobiger, with reduced shells, to the nudibranch Stiliger on the one hand and to the bivalved Berthelinia on the other. The defensive mechanisms of Berthelinia and Stiliger are compared. It is shown that even in Berthelinia. which is protected by a tightly closing bivalved shell, there is a secondary defensive mechanism in the form of a secretion from the hypobranchial gland. In Stiliger, the defensive mechanisms are located in the cerata. Three types of gland are present of which at least one, and probably all, are defensive. In addition the cerata can be autotomised and regenerated, and this may also be of defensive importance. It is also shown that the ceratal glands of Stiliger and the hypobranchial gland of Berthelinia are muscle-operated. It is concluded that in both Stiliger and Berthelinia the defensive system involves two or three defensive mechanisms; and there is evidence that these mechanisms act in series just as do the defensive mechanisms of many tropical insects. The defensive mechanisms of the Doridacea are discussed. It is concluded that camouflage is of widespread occurrence, but that there is as yet no evidence for the occurrence of warning coloration. Many bright colours are <b>deflection</b> <b>marks,</b> but the importance of other bright colours is still not known. Dorsal papillae with a probable defensive function are present in some species of the Doridacea, and they are usually supplied with glands. The function of the caryphyllidia of certain species is not known. Autotomy of papillae has not been described, but autotomy of the mantle edge occurs in the Discodoridinae. Defensive glands are of widespread occurrence in the Doridacea. One type of defensive gland that has not been described before in dorids is the acid gland of Discodoris pusae and Anisodoris stellifera. Acid secretion is well known from certain other opisthobranch and prosobranch molluscs, and the discovery of its occurrence in dorids means that it has evolved independently at least four times in the Mollusca. In D. pusae and A. stellifera, the acid glands are large subepidermal pits with a mucous plug and a muscular sphincter. The acid is inorganic and contains sulphate ions. It may register pH 1 or 2 close to the skin of the mollusc. Another species of Discodoris was found to secrete acid of a similar pH. In this species acid-secretion is from the ordinary epidermal cells, and subepidermal glands are totally absent. In the light of these results, the evolution of acid-secretion is discussed. In all four suborders of the Nudibranchia and in the Sacoglossa, species with dorsal papillae or cerata have evolved. In all cases where these have been studied, they have been found to be of defensive importance. Cerata usually contain glands, are mobile, can be autotomised without harm to the mollusc, and may have yet other defensive mechanisms. The Eolidacea are the best known of these groups with defensive dorsal papillae. In the eolids, some species are camouflaged, but none has been shown to possess warning coloration. Cerata may be brightly coloured to direct attacks away from the head, and the behaviour of the mollusc supports this view. Cerata can be autotomised and regenerated, but the ease with which autotomy occurs varies between different species, Cerata are especially sensitive at their tips, and it is shown that this is because there is a high concentration of neurosensory cilia in this region. Stimulation, by touch, of these cilia can cause ejection of nematocysts or of glandular secretions as a defensive response. Ceratal glands are described for a number of species of solid. The role of the cellules spéciales is discussed, and it is concluded that these are not of defensive importance. Their content of RNA and of protein suggests that they synthesize protein, and their high glycogen content suggests that they are storage cells. They may have a duct in some species, and could thus be excretory. Simple, unicellular mucous glands occur in probably all eolids, but they may be epidermal or subepidermal in different species. They probably protect the animal from abrasion. They may also be responsible for the mucin cuticle, or for the presence of a mucous film just outside the cuticle which is continuously being carried off the tips of the cerata by ciliary action. Mucous glands are the only glands present in some species, for example Eolis M and Tergipes despectus. In other acleioproct eolids there are glands which have a defensive functions the species of Catriona studied have two types of defensive gland, whilst the eubranchids studied have three and possibly five types of defensive gland. These defensive glands are usually concentrated at the tips of the cerata and are exuded when the animal is violently disturbed. Some of them are muscle-operated and are proteinaceous, others contain mucopolysaccharides or mucoproteins. In the smaller species of both Catriona and Eubranchus, the surface area of ceratal epithelium is limited, and the defensive glands are packed so as to utilize all available space. The method of packing the glands is different in the two genera, suggesting that it is a case of parallel evolution. It is further suggested that the defensive glands of Calma, Catriona and the Eubranchidae are convergent. In the cleioprocts studied, no such concentration of glands at the ceras tip was found, but all species possess two or more types of ceratal gland. There is evidence that some of these may be defensive in function. Nematocysts are used in defence by many eolids, but for them to be effective, they must be ejected from the cnidosac and an appreciable percentage of them must explode. It is shown that whilst nematocysts are frequently ejected and exploded as a defensive reaction, there is considerable variation between different species. In Calma, glands are of considerable defensive value, but nematocysts are totally absent; whilst in Tergipes despectus, defensive glands are absent and nematocysts are important in defence. Other species utilize both defensive mechanisms, but to varying extents. In the Cleioprocta generally, and particularly in the Aeolidiidae, glands are not of great importance in defence whilst nematocysts are; but in the Eubranchidae and in Catriona glands are well-developed and of considerable defensive importance. There is even variation within one genus. Thus Catriona tina rarely uses glands but frequently uses nematocysts in defence, whilst C. perca rarely uses nematocysts but frequently uses glands. This interspecific variation in behaviour is probably related to the different predators which different species of eolid are likely to encounter. The predators of nudibranchs in the sea are not well known, but laboratory experiments have demonstrated that many nudibranchs are relatively unpalatable to many species of fish. However, some species of fish are not deterred from eating eolids by nematocysts, and it is likely that it is with relation to these predators that glandular defensive mechanisms have evolved. Thus nematocysts may be protective against one set of predators whilst glands are protective against another set of predators. Nematocysts may be damaging not only to potential predators of eolids, but also to the eolid itself when it crawls over coelenterates. The mechanism by which eolids escape damage from nematocysts is not known, but there is evidence that the vesicular structure of the epidermis is involved. It is concluded that in many nudibranchs the defensive system involves several distinct mechanisms which come into action in series. There is some evidence that certain mechanisms are adapted to specific predators. The eolidiform condition is a particularly efficient defensive adaptation since it concentrates several mechanisms into that part of the mollusc which is expendible, and which is the first to be encountered by a potential predator. Three papers are included in the appendix. The first describes the occurrence of Polycera elegans (Bergh) in Britain, and discusses its taxonomy. The second gives notice of a new species of bivalved gastropod from Jamaica, and the third is a description of this animal. </p...|$|R
