40|$|As a <b>driving</b> <b>parameter</b> {{is slowly}} altered, thermohaline ocean {{circulation}} models show either a smooth {{evolution of a}} mode of flow or an abrupt transition of temperature and salinity fields from one mode to another. An abrupt transition might occur at one value or over a range of the <b>driving</b> <b>parameter.</b> The latter has hysteresis because the mode in this range depends {{on the history of}} the <b>driving</b> <b>parameter.</b> Although assorted ocean circulation models exhibit abrupt transitions, such transitions have not been directly observed in the ocean. Therefore, laboratory experiments have been conducted to seek and observe actual (physical) abrupt thermohaline transitions. An experiment closely duplicating Stommel’s box model possessed abrupt transitions in temperature and salinity with distinct hysteresis. Two subsequent experiments with more latitude for internal circulation in the containers possessed abrupt transitions over a much smaller range of hysteresis. Therefore, a new experiment with even more latitude for internal circulation was designed and conducted. A large tank of constantly renewed freshwater at room temperature had a smaller cavity in the bottom heated from below with saltwater steadily pumped in. The cavity had either a salt mode, consisting of the cavity filled with heated salty water with an interface at the cavity top, or a temperature mode, in which the heat and saltwater were removed from the cavity by convection. There was no measurable hysteresis between the two modes. Possible reasons for such small hysteresis are discussed. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Concept One is {{designed}} to be the best electric supercar, not a supercar with electric motors. The independent drive system and low mounted batteries are specially designed for the driver to adjust. The whole car is developed around the powertrain and battery-pack. Gear changes or clutches are not needed and the reaction time is instant. The batteries can be located in the floor, together with all the other heavy propulsion components in order to achieve a low center of gravity. Thanks to the All Wheel Torque Vectoring System the driver can choose how he wants the car to behave - he can choose between over-steering, under-steering or a neutral handling, adjust the KERS (Kinetic Energy Recovery System) intensity and a whole range of other <b>driving</b> <b>parameters.</b> Each wheel is powered by a separate 12,000 rpm, 250 kW liquid-cooled permanent magnet motor for an overall 1088 hp and 1600 Nm of torque. The vehicle achieves the speed range from 0 to 100 km/h in 2.8 seconds with a limited maximum speed of 305 km/h. The batteries are also designed to be economic - one charge can operate the car for around 510 km (320 miles), and needs to recharge for only 30 min (with an 200 kW power supply station).|$|E
5000|$|BAE Systems {{have also}} claimed that Sampson {{eliminates}} the need for several separate systems. They suggest that on the Type 45 destroyer, the Alenia Marconi Systems/Signaal Thales Nederland S1850M long-range 3D radar that is designed to work in partnership with Sampson [...] "really is superfluous and is not needed to perform the mission of the ship". BAE Systems believes that the reason the large volume search radar has been incorporated into PAAMS is [...] "more of a historic nature, associated with the work sharing issues" [...] that were a huge problem during the trilateral Project Horizon. Some tasks are difficult to combine, for example (long range) volume search takes a lot of radar resources, leaving little room for other tasks such as targeting. Combining volume search with other tasks also results either in slow search rates or in low overall quality per task. <b>Driving</b> <b>parameters</b> in radar performance is time-on-target or observation time per beam. This is perhaps a the sic key reason why the Royal Navy selected the S1850M Long Range Radar to complement Sampson on the Type 45 destroyers. It is also a reason why NATO in its NATO Anti-Air Warfare System study (NAAWS) defined the preferred AAW system as consisting of a complementary Volume Search Radar and MFR. This - as NATO points out - gives the added advantage that the two systems can use two different radar frequencies; one being a good choice for long range search, the other a good choice for an MFR (which is especially nice as physics makes both tasks difficult to combine).|$|E
50|$|The SAMPSON uses two planar arrays {{to provide}} {{coverage}} over {{only part of}} the sky; complete coverage is provided by rotating the arrays, essentially similar to the way conventional radar systems operate. This is in contrast to the US AN/SPY-1 system (as used on the Ticonderoga class cruiser and Arleigh Burke class destroyer) or the Dutch/German/Canadian APAR system (as used on the Royal Dutch Navy's De Zeven Provinciën class frigates, the German Navy's Sachsen class frigates, and the Royal Danish Navy's Ivar Huitfeldt class frigates), which use multiple arrays fixed in place to provide continuous coverage of the entire sky. Whilst this may seem to be a disadvantage, the SAMPSON radar rotates at 30 revolutions per minute, with two back-to-back arrays, meaning no part of the sky lacks coverage for more than one half second on average - the precise time varies as the beams can also be swept back and forth electronically. In addition, the use of a smaller number of arrays allows the system to be much lighter, allowing placement of the arrays {{at the top of a}} prominent mast rather than on the side of the superstructure as in the US ships. Placing any radar emitter at higher altitude extends the horizon distance, improving performance against low level targets (see Sea skimming); SAMPSON is at approximately double the height above the waterline than the arrays of its US equivalents. Although precise details of the SAMPSON's performance in this regard are unlikely to enter the public domain, such factors may mitigate the disadvantages of fewer arrays.Some tasks are difficult to combine, for example (long range) volume search takes a lot of radar resources, leaving little room for other tasks such as targeting.

40|$|Molecular {{clouds are}} {{to a great}} extent {{influenced}} by turbulent motions in the gas. Numerical and observational studies indicate that the star formation rate and efficiency crucially depend on the mixture of solenoidal and compressive modes in the turbulent acceleration field, which can be quantified by the turbulent <b>driving</b> <b>parameter</b> b. For purely solenoidal (divergence-free) driving previous studies showed that b= 1 / 3 and for entirely compressive (curl-free) driving b= 1. In this study, we determine the evolution of the turbulent <b>driving</b> <b>parameter</b> b in magnetohydrodynamical simulations of molecular cloud formation and evolution. The clouds form due to the convergence of two flows of warm neutral gas. We explore different scenarios by varying the magnitude of the initial turbulent perturbations in the flows. We show that the driving mode of the turbulence within the cloud strongly fluctuates with time and exhibits no clear correlation with typical cloud properties, such as the cloud mass and the (Alfven) Mach number. We specifically find that $b$ strongly varies from b= 0. 3 to b= 0. 8 on timescales t< 5 Myr, where the timescale and range of variation can change from cloud to cloud. This rapid change of b from solenoidal to compressive driving is primarily associated with global contraction of the cloud and subsequent onset of star formation. We conclude that the effective turbulence <b>driving</b> <b>parameter</b> should be treated as a free parameter that can vary from solenoidal to compressive in both time and space.

Subsequently, the contributions of the <b>driving</b> <b>parameters</b> are unravelled. We apply the approach to a synthetic model of an upscaled gas field in the northern Netherlands. We find that the inversion procedure leads to coupling between the <b>driving</b> <b>parameters,</b> as it does not discriminate between the individual contributions to the compaction.

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that high-speed universal quantum gates {{can be realized}} by using non-Abelian holonomic transformation. A cyclic evolution path which brings the system periodically back to a degenerate qubit subspace is crucial to holonomic quantum computing.

We investigate the effects of fluctuations in these <b>driving</b> <b>parameters</b> on the transformation fidelity of a universal set of single-qubit quantum gates.

40|$|A {{system of}} two Schnakenberg-like reaction-diffusion {{equations}} is investigated analytically and numerically. The system {{has previously been}} used as a minimal model for concentrations of GTPases involved in the process of cell polarisation. Source and loss terms are added, breaking the mass conservation, which was shown previously to be responsible for the generation of stable fronts via a so-called wave-pinning mechanism. The extended model gives rise to a unique homogeneous equilibrium in the parameter region of interest, which loses stability via a pattern formation, or Turing bifurcation. The bistable character of the reaction terms ensures that this bifurcation is subcrtical for sufficiently small values of the <b>driving</b> <b>parameter</b> multiplying the nonlinear kinetics. This subcriticality leads to the onset of a multitude of localised solutions, through the homoclinic snaking mechanism. As the <b>driving</b> <b>parameter</b> is further decreased, the multitude of solutions transforms into a single pulse through a Belyakov-Devaney transition in which there is the loss of a precursive pattern. An asymptotic analysis is used to probe the conservative limit in which the source and loss terms vanish. Matched asymptotic analysis shows that on an infinite domain the pulse solution transitions into a pair of fronts, with an additional weak quadratic core and exponential tails. On a finite domain, the core and tails disappear, leading to the mere wave-pinning front and its mirror image...|$|R
