5|$|Although {{the fishing}} {{industry}} thrived in Christchurch, {{the importance of the}} harbour declined as it became inaccessible to vessels of a large draught. The harbour entrance was particularly troublesome with constantly shifting sandbars. In 1665 Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, bought the Lordship of the Manor of Christchurch. As part of his plans to improve trade in the town, he attempted to resolve the problems with the harbour entrance by cutting a new one through the sandspit at the foot of Hengistbury Head. However, upon completion the new entrance repeatedly silted up and in 1703 a large storm damaged a <b>groyne</b> which blocked the entrance entirely. Over the following 150 years alternative schemes were proposed but none were ever taken up.|$|E
5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the longshore current is. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a <b>groyne.</b> These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places at different stages of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E
25|$|Nourishment is one {{of three}} {{commonly}} accepted methods for protecting shorelines. The structural alternative involves constructing a seawall, revetment, <b>groyne</b> or breakwater. Alternatively, with managed retreat the shoreline is left to erode, while relocating buildings and infrastructure further inland. Nourishment gained popularity because it preserved beach resources and avoided the negative effects of hard structures. Instead, nourishment creates a “soft” (i.e., non-permanent) structure by creating a larger sand reservoir, pushing the shoreline seaward.|$|E
50|$|<b>Groynes</b> can be {{built with}} {{different}} planview shapes. Some examples include straight <b>groynes,</b> T head, L head, hockey stick, inverted hockey stick <b>groynes,</b> straight <b>groynes</b> with pier head, wing, and tail <b>groynes.</b>|$|R

Usually impermeable <b>groynes</b> are non-submerged, since flow {{over the top}} of solid <b>groynes</b> may cause severe erosion along the shanks. Submerged <b>groynes,</b> on the other hand, may be permeable depending on the degree of flow disturbance needed.|$|R
25|$|The damage George Holloway {{was doing}} to the Head and the {{coastline}} became apparent and local opposition grew. There was also some dispute {{as to whether he}} had violated the terms of his lease. Even so, {{by the time he was}} stopped in 1867, a third of the Head had been removed or lost through increased erosion and his mine had almost cut through to the sea beyond. Removal of the ironstone doggers on the sea side of the Head caused the Spit at the Harbour entrance to grow in length, extending to Steamer point by 1890. A long <b>groyne</b> had to be constructed to take the place of the missing doggers and check the erosion. In 1930, after Christchurch Council had refused to meet the asking price, Hengistbury Head (then in private ownership) was sold to Bournemouth for £25,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{foreshore}} {{boasts a}} quality seaside experience, {{with the local}} landmarks of the <b>Groyne</b> lighthouse and mile-long South Pier to the north, and Marsden Rock and Souter Lighthouse to the south.

25|$|At {{certain times}} of the year these beaches can be covered with dried seaweed from the {{extensive}} marine vegetation under the waters of Western Port, however when the seaweed is not in season, all of Somers beaches boast clean sand. The South Beach has an intricate system of rock pools, this is both of great interest to beachcombers, and something of a curse, as the beach is a difficult place to swim. The Merricks Creek Inlet is a tidal creek that flows with the tides of Western Port. About 50cm {{below the surface of the}} sandbed of the creek lies a darker sand that gives off a hydrogen sulphide smell when disturbed. Sand all these beaches is generally fine grain mixed with crushed sea shells. Small reefs exist in a few places and can be seen at low tide, but these are only rocky reefs incapable of supporting coral. At low tide these reefs can make navigation near the beach difficult for watercraft and are clearly marked with buoys. A succession of big storm tides came in on 24 March, 25 March, 22 April, 23 April and 15 June 2011, severely eroding the sand dunes east the Merricks Creek. In 2012, the wooden wall that had fixed that path of the Merricks Creek since 1974, was taken down, as it was deemed unsafe and not adequately performing its job anymore. Starting in July 2012 and finishing in September 2012, a new rock wall was built, to fix the creek on a path straight into Westernport. For the three and a half years the wall has been in place, a noticeable buildup of sand has occurred east of the wall, while considerable erosion has occurred west of the wall. In November 2015, the entrance to the Merricks Creek was filled in with a sand <b>groyne,</b> as a short term solution to the constant hydrogen sulphide odour caused by the breakdown of sea grasses within the creek. As of June 2016, the sand <b>groyne</b> is still in place, and as such the surrounding beaches have benefitted with the buildup of sand.|$|E
40|$|In October and November 2009 a {{pilot project}} has been {{executed}} at the Delfland Coast in the Netherlands, constructing three small sandy headlands called Sand <b>Groynes.</b> Sand <b>Groynes</b> are nourished from the shore in seaward direction and anticipated to redistribute in the alongshore due {{to the impact of}} waves and currents to create the sediment buffer in the upper shoreface. The results presented in this paper intend to contribute to the assessment of Sand <b>Groynes</b> as a commonly applied nourishment method to maintain sandy coastlines. The morphological evolution of the Sand <b>Groynes</b> has been monitored by regularly conducting bathymetry surveys, resulting in a series of available bathymetry surveys. It is observed that the Sand <b>Groynes</b> have been redistributed in the alongshore, mainly in northward direction driven by dominant southwesterly wave conditions. Furthermore, data analysis suggests that Sand <b>Groynes</b> have a trapping capacity for alongshore supplied sand originating from upstream located Sand <b>Groynes.</b> A Delft 3 D numerical model has been set up to verify whether the morphological evolution of Sand <b>Groynes</b> can be properly hindcasted. Although the model has been set up in 2 DH mode, hindcast results show good agreement with the morphological evolution of Sand <b>Groynes</b> based on field data. Trends of alongshore redistribution of Sand <b>Groynes</b> are well reproduced. Still the model performance could be improved, for instance by implementation of 3 D velocity patterns and by a more accurate schematization of sediment characteristics.

500|$|The spit {{is subject}} to coastal erosion which has {{gradually}} pushed the spit towards the shore, a process which has eaten away at {{the remnants of the}} 1852 west wing battery and barracks, and has exposed the foundations of the later fortress on occasions. This erosion has increased significantly since the 1940s, due to the construction of <b>groyne</b> barriers at nearby Bournemouth and Christchurch which prevented the natural renewing of the spit with pebbles washed from local cliffs. Erosion caused fresh damage to the eastern end of the castle in early 2013, leading to renewed concerns. Government efforts began in the 1960s to try to stabilise the spit in its current position, both to protect the castle and neighbouring towns, with over [...] of gravel being laid down in the 1990s, and is continuing in the 21st century. The spit and the adjoining coastline is protected as an SSSI.|$|E
500|$|The {{sand and}} clay on which Weymouth is built is very low-lying—large areas are below sea level, which allowed the eastern areas of the town to flood during extreme low {{pressure}} storms. In the 1980s and 1990s a sea wall was built around Weymouth Harbour and along the coast road in Preston; a rip rap <b>groyne</b> in Greenhill and beach nourishment up to Preston have created a wide and artificially graded pebble beach, {{to ensure that the}} low-lying land around Lodmoor does not flood. The defences at Preston, the extended ferry terminal and the widening of the Esplanade have changed the sediment regime in Weymouth Bay, narrowing the beach at Greenhill and widening the sands in Weymouth. A study conducted as part of the redevelopment of the Pavilion complex showed that the proposed marina will contribute slightly to this effect, but sand dredged out of the marina could be used to make the beach up to [...] wider.|$|E

The <b>Groyne</b> shows an occulting light which marks a safe entrance course between the piers, showing white to a vessel approaching from seaward on the correct course, green to a vessel off-course to the north, and red to one off-course to the south. Built by Newcastle-upon-Tyne Trinity House in 1882, It consists of an upper hexagonal part, including the lantern, of wood and corrugated iron construction, sitting on twelve cylindrical steel legs. The whole structure is painted red and stands [...] in height. The Herd <b>Groyne</b> lighthouse was refurbished and repainted in 2014.|$|E
5000|$|Measures of {{protection}} against the continuous erosion {{date back to the}} early 19th century when <b>groynes</b> of wooden poles were constructed. Those were built at right angles into the sea from the coast line. Later they were replaced by metal and eventually by armoured concrete <b>groynes.</b> The constructions did not have the desired effect of stopping the erosion caused by crossways currents.

2500|$|... and indeed, in 1535, Henry VIII {{had ordered}} the removal of all fish weirs as they impeded navigation. The most {{difficult}} part of the journey was gaining entrance to the harbour with its constantly shifting sandbars. In 1665 Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, bought the Lordship of the Manor of Christchurch. As part of his plans to improve trade in the town, he decide to resolve the problems with the entrance to the harbour by cutting a new one through the sandspit at the foot of Hengistbury Head. He commissioned a report which outlined the advantages of doing so, which also suggested that 5th and 6th rate ships could be built there with wood from the New Forest and armed with guns cast from the ironstone doggers which lay in great piles nearby. The building of a fort on the headland, the report concluded, would make the anchorage 'almost impregnable'. In addition an act was proposed to dredge the Avon to make it navigable for larger vessels but this came to nothing. Despite this, Hyde started work on the new entrance, laying down a line of ironstone doggers. These doggers, now known as Clarendon's Rocks, can still be seen at low tide. The new entrance however was continually silting up and in 1703 a large storm hit, damaging the <b>groyne</b> and filling up the new entrance. This appears to have been the last straw and the attempt was abandoned. Over the following 150 years many alternative schemes were put forward but none of them were taken up.|$|E
2500|$|Coastal erosion at Hampton-on-Sea {{has been}} {{estimated}} at [...] per annum between {{the construction of the}} old Hampton Pier in 1865 to 1959 when the Council built the sea wall. The direction and rate of influential currents is unknown, but it is calculated that [...] of coastal sediment per annum is scoured by the sea from the Hampton-on-Sea coast and deposited [...] to the west at Long Rock, Swalecliffe. This area with a defensive frontage of [...] is now known as the Hampton Flood Basin and Hampton Brook, now officially Westbrook, is still prone to floodlocking, as occurred in 2001. Although the 1959 sea wall and groynes were updated in 1983, and Hampton Pier Avenue's rock armour revetment was upgraded in 1994, it is thought that eventually the sea defences would need to be raised. Nevertheless, although sea-damage was done by the great 1953 and 1978 storms, the upgraded defences protected this coast from the severe 1996 storm. Costs of increasing flood defences here are estimated at £1–7million, especially as the work has to be modified because this area is a SSSI and SPA. Cost and limitations meant that a short-term solution of £635,000 capital works was recommended by the Council Steering Group on 29 June 2009 to be implemented from winter 2011 to spring 2011. The recommendation was to hold the line with replacement and improvement of six timber groynes, importing a new beach of [...] partly taken from Long Rock, raising and extending the rear wall and closing off openings with floodgates.
