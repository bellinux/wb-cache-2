50|$|Constructed of <b>elasticized</b> <b>fabric</b> and {{sometimes}} fastened with hook and eye closures, the modern girdle {{is designed to}} enhance a woman's figure. Most open-bottom girdles extend from the waist to the upper thighs. In the 1960s, these models fell from favor and were {{to a great extent}} replaced by panty girdles, which resemble a tight pair of athletic shorts. Both models of girdles may include suspender clips to hold up stockings.|$|E
5000|$|A dance belt {{resembles a}} thong {{undergarment}} in design {{but has a}} wider waist belt so the flesh at the waist is not pinched in. At the back this waist belt {{is connected to the}} bottom of the front triangular panel that covers and supports the male genital parts by a very narrow piece of <b>elasticized</b> <b>fabric.</b> This strip of fabric passes between the wearer's legs and is recessed in the crevice formed by the two buttocks and is sometimes referred to as a [...] "T-back" [...] design.|$|E

5000|$|Since the 20th century, {{the word}} [...] "girdle" [...] {{also has been}} used to define an {{undergarment}} made of <b>elasticized</b> <b>fabric</b> that was worn by women. It is a form-fitting foundation garment that encircles the lower torso, perhaps extending below the hips, and worn often to shape or for support. It may be worn for aesthetic or medical reasons. In sports or medical treatment, a girdle may be worn as a compression garment. This form of women's foundation wear replaced the corset in popularity, and was in turn to a large extent surpassed by the pantyhose in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|The {{shaft of}} a fashion boot can be fitted (i.e. {{following}} {{the curve of}} the wearer’s calf), straight-legged, or loose-fitting (or “slouchy”). In close-fitting boots, flexibility is achieved by the use of gussets; slits in the material either {{at the top of the}} shaft (in knee-length boots), or wider panels at the sides of the shaft (in ankle boots), which are backed with <b>elasticized</b> <b>fabric.</b> Compression folds around the ankle allow for movement of the foot. In over-the-knee boots, flexion of the knee is usually attained by a vent at the back of the boot, running from the top of the shaft to the back of the knee. This may be closed with laces, elasticized, or left open. Where a vent is not used, freedom of movement is achieved either by having the top of the shaft flare outwards above the knee, or making all or part of the shaft out of a stretchable material.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} testing results of a prototype passive downdraft evaporative cooling tower PDEC installed and tested to guide {{the design of a}} permanent tower intended as a cost effective retrofit to the Miele Showroom at the South African head offices in Johannesburg. The showroom forms {{a large part of the}} building which was completed 2 years ago. The building was designed without air conditioning but without quantifiable passive strategies. The occupants experience discomfort during the winter and summer extremes and air conditioning systems are being installed as a retrofit. The Tshwane University of Technology was approached to measure the performance of the building and to suggest interventions to improve the performance. Paul Carew was consulted for assistance and advice. One of the interventions suggested was a “shower tower’ to temper the showroom during hotter periods. This paper describes the space that is to be served by the tower, the tower itself and some lessons learnt during the construction of the tower and argues that the strategy is appropriate to the space and the climate. The prototype shower tower consists of a tube of <b>elasticized</b> <b>fabric</b> suspended from the roof structure with a metal hoop at the top and the bottom to hold the shape. Water is vaporise...|$|E
