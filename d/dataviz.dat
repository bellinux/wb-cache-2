50|$|In 2004, he co-founded {{with visual}} artist Yann Le Guennec the {{research}} group Anoptique that developed <b>dataviz</b> experiences on the Internet. In this regard were conducted several projects {{in partnership with}} the Fondation Internet Nouvelle Génération (FING), Orange Lab/France Telecom R&D and INRIA, which led from 2005 on the development of many visualization tools. Anoptique commonly advised organizations such as UNESCO, the Ministry of Culture, the French Development Agency on their strategy of free software, groupware, interactive mapping and open data.|$|E

50|$|Documents To Go is BlackBerry's {{cross-platform}} office suite for Palm OS, Windows Mobile, Maemo, BlackBerry OS, Symbian, Android, and iOS. Also, a larger-screen version {{would have}} been included with the Palm Foleo, but Palm, Inc. cancelled the device before its release. The desktop tool, which provides document synchronization between one's handheld device and one's computer, is available for both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.

40|$|This is an {{introduction}} to creating figures in R using the package ggplot 2. We will show how to read data into R using a few sources, including the data repository Dataverse. We then will introduce ggplot 2, which we think provides an elegant and lego-like way to provide {{an introduction}} to <b>dataviz.</b> It implements a grammar of graphics that lets users layer graphical elements in a modular and adaptable way.

40|$|While basic Web {{analytics}} {{tools are}} widespread and provide statistics about Web site navigation, no approaches exist for merging such statistics {{with information about}} the Web application structure, content and semantics. We demonstrate the advantages of combining Web application models with runtime navigation logs, at the purpose of deepening the understanding of users behaviour. We propose a model-driven approach that combines user interaction modeling (based on the IFML standard), full code generation of the designed application, user tracking at runtime through logging of runtime component execution and user activities, integration with page content details, generation of integrated schema-less data streams, and application of large-scale analytics and visualization tools for big data, by applying both traditional <b>dataviz</b> techniques and direct representation of statistics on visual models of the Web application...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAnalysts {{are today}} given (or develop) {{a wide range}} of {{powerful}} visual reasoning tools, of leading-edge platforms where services like high interactivity, high computing capacity, structured knowledge, processing of complex reasoning tasks on massive data, are duly implemented. Classic XVIIIth or XIXth century <b>dataviz</b> solutions may then appear as respectable, but deprecated - far too simple to match today's challenges. In this paper we try to show that the very simplicity of these solutions can still be of help in problem-solving situations. We first revisit some great classics in order to uncover patterns and exceptions inside a data set consisting of incomplete historical evidence on groups of stalls that used to be located on the market square in Cracow. We show that, once reinterpreted and re-implemented, classic visualisations like Charles De Fourcroy's tableau poléométrique or Munehisa Homma's candlestick chart do help the analyst to re-read the data, and to augment his level of knowledge. We then introduce an online, free to use implementation of these classics that we expect to weigh through a sort-of crowdsourcing approach to which extent they can act as relevant and generic visual formalisms. Finally, we underline the potential contribution of this research in terms of methodology, and discuss in what simplicity proves here helpful...|$|E
