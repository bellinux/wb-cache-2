50|$|If the {{formation}} pressure is relatively high, using a lower density mud {{will reduce the}} well bore pressure below the pore pressure of {{the formation}}. Sometimes an inert gas is injected into the drilling mud to reduce its <b>equivalent</b> <b>density</b> and hence its hydrostatic pressure throughout the well depth. This gas is commonly nitrogen, as it is non-combustible and readily available, but air, reduced oxygen air, processed flue gas and natural gas have all been used in this fashion.|$|E

This is usually because, {{in order to}} reduce the <b>equivalent</b> <b>density</b> of the drilling mud, a compressible gas is injected into the mud. This causes high signal attenuation which drastically reduces the ability of the mud to transmit pulsed data. In this case, it is necessary to use methods different from mud pulse telemetry, such as electromagnetic waves propagating through the formation or wired drill pipe telemetry.|$|E

50|$|Under extreme {{conditions}} such as when cooled beyond Tλ, helium {{has the ability to}} form a new state of matter, known as a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), in which the atoms virtually lose all their energy. Without energy to transfer between molecules, the atoms begin to aggregate creating an area of <b>equivalent</b> <b>density</b> and energy. From observations, liquid helium only exhibits super-fluidity because it contains isolated islands of BECs, which have well-defined magnitude and phase, as well as well-defined phonon-roton (P-R) modes. A phonon refers to a quantum of energy associated with a compressional wave such as the vibration of a crystal lattice while a roton refers to an elementary excitation in superfluid helium. In the BEC’s, the P-R modes have the same energy, which explains the zero point vibrational energies of helium in preventing lattice formation.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new fast {{multipole}} method for particle simulations. The main feature of our algorithm {{is that it}} does not require the implementation of multipole expansions of the underlying kernel, and it is based only on kernel evaluations. Instead of using analytic expansions to represent the potential generated by sources inside a box of the hierarchical FMM tree, we use a continuous distribution of an <b>equivalent</b> <b>density</b> on a surface enclosing the box. To find this <b>equivalent</b> <b>density</b> we match its potential to the potential of the original sources at a surface, in the far field, by solving local Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. The far field evaluations are sparsified with singular value decomposition in 2 D or fast Fourier transforms in 3 D. We have tested the new method on the single and double layer operators for the Laplacian, the modified Laplacian, the Stokes, the modified Stokes, the Navier, and the modified Navier operators in two and three dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that our method compares very well with the best known implementations of the analytic FMM method for both the Laplacian and modified Laplacian kernels.

In Si 3 N 4 - 6 wt% Y 2 O 3 increasing the heating rate from 7 C/min to 25 C/min to 90 C/min results in a corresponding decrease in the final density from 3. 01 g/cu cm to 2. 92 g/cu cm to 2. 76 g/cu cm.

40|$|A solid {{corrosion-resistant}} torsional waveguide of diamond {{cross section}} {{has been developed}} to sense on-line and in real-time {{the characteristics of the}} liquid in which it is submerged. The sensor can measure, among other things, the liquid content of a bubbly medium; the density of adjacent pure liquids; the <b>equivalent</b> <b>density</b> of liquid-vapor mixtures or particulate suspensions; a suspension 2 ̆ 7 s concentration; and the liquid level. The sensor exploits the phenomenon that the speed of propagation of a torsional stress wave in a submerged waveguide with a noncircular cross section is inversely proportional to the <b>equivalent</b> <b>density</b> of the liquid in which the waveguide is submerged. The sensor may be used to conduct measurements along distances ranging from 20 mm to 20 m and over a wide range of temperatures and pressures, e. g., from the cryogenic temperature of liquid nitrogen, - 196 °C, up to hot pressurized water at 300 °C and 7 MPa. A self-calibrating three-zone sensor and associated electronics have also been developed to compensate for any sensor inaccuracies due to operation over a wide range of temperature. In some of the water experiments at room temperature, unexpected attenuation of the guided torsional waves was observed. This excess attenuation depends in part on the waveguide 2 ̆ 7 s surface finish. It appears to be caused by air microbubbles adhering to the waveguide, imposing one of the practical limits on the maximum sensor length in nondegassed or aerated water...|$|E
