According to Carey, the video had already been conceptualized by mid-March, with a script featuring Carey, Keaton and a church choir as the main focuses. In a later interview, Carey said, [...] "We don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to do it. It's not a big-budget thing. But it doesn't need to be. It just needs to be about the song, capturing the song and the emotion of it." [...] While plans for the video's filming were made, a final version was never released or commissioned.|$|E

[...] He appreciated the film's hand-drawn animation: [...] "I think the movie's drawings are much superior than the TV show", although CGI animation was flourishing {{at the time of the}} film's release. [...] "There's a lot of talk about 2-D being dead, and I hope people don't think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it's all about what you're trying to say. There are many ways to tell a story, and what's unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story." [...] The clay animation scenes were shot by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan at Screen Novelties in Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Morse portrayed George Washington in the HBO miniseries John Adams, {{for which}} {{his nose was}} made bigger. Morse commented: [...] "The first {{thing that comes to}} mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> because they asked me to do this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|According to Staten, Tor Books asked Bungie if {{they had}} someone suited to writing the next novel; Staten, having written much of the Halo series canon, was the obvious choice. The author found that the book was {{the perfect way to}} {{elaborate}} on the Halo story without stripping it down for a video game: [...] "I always felt we shortchanged [...] We don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to tell story while the bullets are flying." [...] In addition, Staten said that the novel was the perfect way to do the character of Sergeant Johnson—who had appeared somewhat one-dimensional in the games—proper justice as a well-rounded character. Replying to G4TV's question about writing action, Staten replied that he felt that writing [...] "involves slowing things down", in comparison to a game of Halo. The author also said that the work of his favorite science-fiction authors helped teach him the importance of honing a [...] "strong, consistent voice".|$|E
500|$|A major effect {{required}} {{throughout the}} episode was face replacements, {{especially during the}} 'May vs. May' fight where it had to appear as if Wen was fighting herself. All the effects were completed in the two weeks between the filming and airing of the episode. Wen noted that [...] "Kevin Tancharoen directed [...] and he’s amazing with his directing with the Mortal Kombat series. So we had this really complicated sequence where we do this 360 and it reveals me and it reveals me again and there’s no cut and you wonder how that happens {{in one of the}} fight sequences. And that’s because they completely scanned and CGIed my face onto the stunt double. So there’s a tremendous amount of work that went into the fight scenes and we did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to do it." [...] She also elaborated that [...] "On the day of, you have the set and you have the cameras, and {{you have to deal with}} special effects, because on top of everything else we had to scan my face and go through this incredible process of taking a million pictures so they were able to meld it onto Sam’s face." ...|$|E

Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, [...] "This has been the easiest post process we've ever had on a film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, the tricky thing is the effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and everyone has very high standards. So everyone starts killing themselves at this point...we'll be done with the movie in two and a half months."

Rubby De La Rosa pitched a career-high seven innings, allowing just the one run on six hits, but it was not enough as the Dodgers offense went back into hibernation. The team finished the month ten games under [...]500 and fell into last place in the National League Western division. Matt Kemp summed up the team's attitude, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> left, we're going to keep playing, keep battling, and we're going to try our best to turn this thing around.
