5|$|Bickford {{was born}} in Kentucky but raised in West Virginia. He began his {{professional}} career in 1939 and, after serving in World War II, made the majors in 1949. Acquired by the Braves organization due to a <b>flip</b> <b>of</b> a coin, Bickford {{became one of the}} most promising National League pitchers during his playing career, earning All-Star honors in 1949 and leading the National League in complete games in 1950. However his career was soon shorted by multiple arm injuries, and he was out of baseball by 1955. After working an assortment of jobs, he was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1960 and died after a three-month illness.|$|E
5|$|Using the riddles, Bruce and his butler, Alfred, deduce the Riddler's secret identity. Chase is {{imprisoned by}} The Riddler and Two-Face in their hideout. Dick returns and becomes Batman's sidekick, Robin, after {{realising}} that the Caped Crusader {{could use a}} hand. Batman and Robin head to Riddler and Two-Face's lair, Claw Island, where they are separated. Robin encounters Two-Face and nearly kills him, but realizing {{that he does not}} have it in him to murder, Robin spares him. Two-Face gets the upper hand and captures Robin. Batman arrives at the lair, where Robin and Chase are held as hostages. The Riddler gives Batman a chance to save only one hostage, but Batman destroys the Riddler's brainwave collecting device, causing the Riddler to suffer a mental breakdown. Batman then rescues both Robin and Chase. Two-Face corners the trio and determines their fate with the <b>flip</b> <b>of</b> a coin, but Batman throws a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to stumble and fall to his death. The Riddler is taken to Arkham Asylum and imprisoned, but he claims he knows who Batman is. Chase is asked to consult on the case, but Nygma says that he himself is Batman, due to his damaged memories. Chase meets Bruce outside and tells him that his secret is safe before parting ways. Bruce resumes his crusade as Batman with Robin as his partner to protect Gotham from crime.|$|E

In this paper, they speculate that code constraints on nucleotide sequences allow protein synthesis {{without the need for}} a ribosome. It, however, requires a five base binding between the mRNA and tRNA with a <b>flip</b> <b>of</b> the anti-codon creating a triplet coding, even though it is a five-base physical interaction. Thomas H. Jukes pointed out that the code constraints on the mRNA sequence required for this translation mechanism is still preserved.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} (3×3×3) Rubik's Cube {{has eight}} corners and twelve edges. There are 8! (40,320) ways {{to arrange the}} corner cubes. Each corner has three possible orientations, although only seven (of eight) can be oriented independently; {{the orientation of the}} eighth (final) corner depends on the preceding seven, giving 37 (2,187) possibilities. There are 12!/2 (239,500,800) ways to arrange the edges, restricted from 12! because edges must be in an even permutation exactly when the corners are. (When arrangements of centres are also permitted, as described below, the rule is that the combined arrangement of corners, edges, and centres must be an even permutation.) Eleven edges can be flipped independently, with the <b>flip</b> <b>of</b> the twelfth depending on the preceding ones, giving 211 (2,048) possibilities.|$|E

25|$|The Bedser {{brothers}} {{began playing}} cricket together at age seven for local school sides and Woking Cricket Club. Both twins also played football for Surrey Boys, and considered a professional career in that sport. They were educated at Maybury Junior School and Monument Hill Central School. From {{the age of}} 14, the twins worked as clerks at a solicitor's office in Lincoln's Inn Fields. They were spotted by Surrey coach Alan Peach in 1938 and joined the Surrey county squad staff at the Oval, making their first-class debuts in the same match in June 1939. There is a famous story that when Eric and Alec were first selected for Surrey, they agreed they couldn't both be fast bowlers, as at that time they were. A <b>flip</b> <b>of</b> the coin saw Alec win the toss, and Eric consequently took up off-spin bowling, at which he became very adept in a Surrey county team that was dominated by famous spinners such as Jim Laker and Tony Lock, and concentrated on his batting.|$|E
500|$|He was {{promoted}} to the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association for the 1947 campaign when Indianapolis owner Frank McKinney bought controlling interest in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. [...] Allegedly, Bickford stayed {{as part of the}} Braves organization due to a <b>flip</b> <b>of</b> a coin at a local bar. An argument endured between McKinney, Braves president Lou Perini and Braves general manager John Quinn during spring training over the fate of the players in the organization, with McKinney wanting to move Indianapolis and all its players to the Pirates organization. [...] Via a gentleman's agreement, they decided to split the players with a <b>flip</b> <b>of</b> a coin. They flipped a coin for the first selection, similar to a sports draft. [...] If the coin landed heads, the player was headed to the Pirates organization and if it landed tails they stayed in Braves organization. The coin landed on tails, and the Braves picked Bickford and took over his contract. Perini later recalled on why he selected Bickford. Brooklyn's general manager Branch Rickey had interest in the young right-hander, and Perini thought that [...] "if Bickford was good enough for Rickey, he was good enough for the Braves". Bickford played for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1947, where he had a 9–5 win-loss record with a 3.78 earned run average in 29 games, 14 of which were starts.|$|E
500|$|The {{first class}} of {{students}} at the Georgia School of Technology was small and homogeneous, and educational options were limited. 85students signed up on the first registration day, October 7, 1888, and the enrollment {{for the first year}} climbed to a total of 129 by January 7, 1889. The first student to register was William H. Glenn. All but {{one or two of the}} students were from Georgia. Tuition was free for Georgia residents and $150 (...) for out-of-state students. The only degree offered was a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, and no elective courses were available. All students were required to follow exactly the same program, which was so rigorous that nearly two thirds of the first class failed to complete it.

At the end of that season, Porto finished runners-up to Benfica in the league and qualified for the following season's Fairs Cup. The club's performance was similar to that of the previous campaign: a first-round elimination of a French team (Stade Français) followed by a second-round loss to a German team (Hannover 96), [...] which included a 5–0 away defeat that was, at the time, Porto's heaviest in Europe.

Drake told MTV News, that {{the song was}} [...] "definitely" [...] a choice of his for releasing as a single, {{and that it was}} a song he did for himself. [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song, [...] "a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness." [...] The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a <b>flip</b> <b>of</b> hip-hop group Dead Prez's [...] "Hip-Hop", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. Ironically, Dead Prez's track is meant as a jab at media controlled artists like Drake, stating, [...] "One thing about music when it hits you feel no pain/ White folks say it controls your brain/ I know better than that/ It's just game", to which Drake stated when asked about it, [...] "I love that flow. So I took that flow and flipped it in the second verse." [...] He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his [...] "Thriller" [...] video, though the lines, [...] "'Bout to go 'Thriller' Mike Jackson on these niggas/ All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers." [...] On the reference, Drake said, [...] "That was sort of my reference point; that phenomenon of Michael. He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move.
