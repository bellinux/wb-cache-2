500|$|James first {{recorded}} {{the song in}} August 1954 at Modern Records' new studio in Culver City, California. [...] Maxwell Davis supervised the session {{and a group of}} professional studio musicians provided the backup. [...] The song was produced in a newer style that Modern used successfully for B.B. King and James' slide guitar was placed further back in the mix. [...] Flair Records, another of the Bihari brothers' Modern labels, released the single, backed with [...] "Sunny Land". [...] The song became a regional hit, but did not reach the national charts. [...] Labels associated with Modern included [...] "Standing at the Crossroads" [...] on several James compilation albums, such as Blues After Hours (Crown), The Blues in My Heart – The Rhythm <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Soul</b> (Custom Records), and Original Folk Blues (Kent Records).|$|E
500|$|In a {{dramatic}} debate with Frederick Douglass at the AERA convention in 1869, Stone argued that suffrage for women {{was more important}} than suffrage for African Americans. She nevertheless supported the amendment, saying, [...] "But I thank God for that XV. Amendment, and hope that it will be adopted in every State. I will be thankful <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>soul</b> if any body can get out of the terrible pit. [...] But I believe that the safety of the government would be more promoted by the admission of woman as an element of restoration and harmony than the negro." [...] Stone and her allies expected that their active support for the amendment to enfranchise black men would lead their abolitionist friends in Congress to push for an amendment to enfranchise women as the next step, but that did not happen.|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky {{first visited}} Ukraine in 1864, staying in Trostianets where {{he wrote his}} first orchestral work, The Storm overture. Over the next 28 years, he visited over 15 places in Ukraine, where he stayed a few months at the time. Among his most {{favorite}} places was Kamianka, Cherkasy Oblast, where his sister Alexandra lived with her family. He wrote of Kamianka: [...] "I found a feeling of peace <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>soul,</b> which I couldn't find in Moscow and St Petersburg". Tchaikovsky wrote more than 30 compositions while in Ukraine. He also visited Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko and attended his Taras Bulba opera performance in 1890 in the Kiev Opera House. Tchaikovsky {{was one of the}} founders of the Kiev Music Conservatory, which was later renamed after him. He also performed in concerts as a conductor in Kiev, Odessa, and Kharkiv.|$|E

500|$|At the time, Warner Bros. had a {{deal with}} Inherit Productions, the {{production}} arm of Schwaid-Merenstein which was founded by manager Bob Schwaid (who worked for Warners Publishing) and producer Lewis Merenstein. Merenstein {{received a call from}} Warner Bros. to go see Morrison in [...] Boston and related how eight or nine producers had gone to hear Morrison thinking they were going to hear [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] and [...] "it was another person with the same voice". Merenstein first heard Morrison play at Ace Recording studio and recalled that when [...] Morrison played the song [...] "Astral Weeks" [...] for him, [...] "I started crying. It just vibrated <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>soul,</b> and I knew that I wanted to work with that sound." [...] While Merenstein had been to see Morrison, [...] Schwaid had set to work on resolving Morrison's contractual [...] troubles.|$|E
500|$|Nada Es Igual... is {{an album}} which {{consists}} of [...] uptempo [...] "jazzy, brassy, Al Jarreau-like" [...] pop songs and power ballads. [...] Its uptempo tracks include [...] "Si Te Vas" [...] and [...] "Todo Por Su Amor" [...] which utilize horn instruments and [...] "Cómo Es Posible Que a Mi Lado" [...] which incorporates house music. [...] "Dame" [...] is a R-lite" [...] with tune hip-hop influences. Los Angeles Times music critic Enrique Lopetegui wrote that the album is [...] "basically {{a continuation of the}} singer's favorite turf - ... woman-melting ballads." [...] The first track on the album, [...] "Si Te Vas", is a song about the narrator who yearns to remain with his lover: ("Every morning when I wake up, I feel anxiety <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>soul,</b> I want to listen to your voice, I want to feel your kisses"). The power ballads in the album are [...] "Que Tú Te Vas", [...] "Abrázame", [...] "Un Día Más", and the title track. For arrangements on the ballads, Miguel received assistance from the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The album also features the song [...] "Sueña", the Spanish-language version of [...] "Someday" [...] by All-4-One from the movie The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It was released as a single for the Latin American edition of The Hunchback of Notre Dame soundtrack and peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs, and number one on the Latin Pop Songs charts.|$|E

2500|$|Robinson {{answered}} his critics {{the following year}} with A Quiet Storm, released in 1975. The album launched three singles – the number-one R hit [...] "Baby That's Backatcha", [...] "The Agony & The Ecstasy" [...] and [...] "Quiet Storm". However, Robinson's solo career suffered from his work as Motown's vice president, and his own music took the backseat. As a result, several albums including Smokey's Family Robinson, Deep <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Soul,</b> Love Breeze and Smokin, saw poor promotion and received bad reviews. At this point Robinson relied on other writers and producers {{to help him with}} his albums.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} Warner Bros. {{released}} George's only solo album, Thanks, I'll Eat It Here, {{for which he}} had signed a contract in 1975. The album was mostly a collection of cover versions that George had been working on as a side project for several years and, in his biography, Rock And Roll Doctor, Mark Brend states that George had hinted he only signed the solo contract in order to obtain funds to finance Little Feat (and Bill Flanagan states in Written <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Soul</b> that George [...] "didn't want his audience to assume a collection of other people's material marked the direction of Lowell George's solo career").|$|E

2500|$|George {{did some}} work {{on what would}} {{eventually}} become Down on the Farm but then [...] declared that Little Feat had disbanded. In an interview with Bill Flanagan (for the book Written <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Soul)</b> conducted eleven days before his death, George {{made it clear that}} he felt the demise of Little Feat was due to his having allowed the band to be run democratically, with the result that Payne and, to a lesser extent, Barrere, had a presence as songwriters and in production which was disproportionate to their abilities. George was particularly scathing about Payne's attempts at jazz/fusion, citing an instance when Payne jammed with Weather Report on a TV show and dropped [...] "into one of his 'Day at the Dog Races'. I just got out of there as fast as I could. It was embarrassing". In the same interview, George stated that he planned to reunite Little Feat without Payne and Barrère.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass I yielded to a {{drowsiness}} similar to a sweet sleep. [...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>soul.</b> I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from her}} Communist Party membership, her Irish {{heritage}} {{is the other}} sensitive aspect of Murdoch's political life that seems to attract interest. [...] Part of the interest revolves around the fact that, although Irish by both birth and traced descent on both sides, Murdoch does not display the full set of political opinions that are sometimes assumed to go with this origin: [...] "No one ever agrees about who is entitled to lay claim to Irishness. [...] Iris's Belfast cousins today call themselves British, not Irish... with both parents brought up in Ireland, and an ancestry within Ireland both North and South going back three centuries, Iris has as valid a claim to call herself Irish as most North Americans have to call themselves American". [...] Conradi notes A.N. Wilson's record that Murdoch regretted the sympathetic portrayal of the Irish nationalist cause she had given earlier in The Red and the Green, and a competing defence of the book at Caen in 1978. The novel while broad of sympathy is hardly an unambiguous celebration of the 1916 rising, dwelling upon bloodshed, unintended consequences and the evils of romanticism, besides celebrating selfless individuals on both sides. Later, of Ian Paisley, Iris Murdoch stated [...] " [...] sincerely condemns violence and {{did not intend to}} incite the Protestant terrorists. That he is emotional and angry is not surprising, after 12–15 years of murderous IRA activity. All this business is deep <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>soul,</b> I'm afraid." [...] In private correspondence with her close friend and fellow philosopher Philippa Foot, she remarked in 1978 that she felt [...] "unsentimental about Ireland to the point of hatred" [...] and, of a Franco-Irish conference she had attended in Caen in 1982, said that [...] "the sounds of all those Irish voices made me feel privately sick".|$|E
