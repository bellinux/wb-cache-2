A similar process occurs in the formation of DNA, except that ATP is first converted to the <b>deoxyribonucleotide</b> dATP. [...] Like many condensation reactions in nature, DNA replication and DNA transcription also consumes ATP.|$|E
2500|$|The {{replisome}} {{is responsible}} for copying the entire genomic DNA in each proliferative cell. The base pairing and chain formation reactions, which form the daughter helix, are catalyzed by DNA polymerases. These enzymes move along single-stranded DNA and allow for {{the extension of the}} nascent DNA strand by [...] "reading" [...] the template strand and allowing for incorporation of the proper purine nucleobases, adenine and guanine, and pyrimidine nucleobases, thymine and cytosine. Activated free deoxyribonucleotides exist in the cell as <b>deoxyribonucleotide</b> triphosphates (dNTPs). These free nucleotides are added to an exposed 3'-hydroxyl group on the last incorporated nucleotide. In this reaction, a pyrophosphate is released from the free dNTP, generating energy for the polymerization reaction and exposing the 5' monophosphate, which is then covalently bonded to the 3' oxygen. Additionally, incorrectly inserted nucleotides can be removed and replaced by the correct nucleotides in an energetically favorable reaction. This property is vital to proper proofreading and repair of errors that occur during DNA replication.|$|E

50|$|A <b>deoxyribonucleotide</b> is the monomer, {{or single}} unit, of DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid. Each <b>deoxyribonucleotide</b> {{comprises}} three parts: a nitrogenous base, a deoxyribose sugar, and one phosphate group. The nitrogenous base is always bonded to the 1' carbon of the deoxyribose, which is distinguished from ribose {{by the presence}} of a proton on the 2' carbon rather than an -OH group. The phosphate groups bind to the 5' carbon of the sugar.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of hydrolases, {{specifically}} those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds.

50|$|The RNA {{fragments}} {{are then}} removed by DNA polymerase I for prokaryotes or DNA polymerase δ for eukaryotes (different mechanisms {{are used in}} eukaryotes and prokaryotes) and new <b>deoxyribonucleotides</b> are added to fill the gaps where the RNA was present. DNA ligase then joins the <b>deoxyribonucleotides</b> together, completing the synthesis of the lagging strand.|$|R
50|$|Once priming is complete, DNA {{polymerase}} III holoenzyme {{is loaded}} into the DNA and replication begins. The catalytic mechanism of DNA polymerase III {{involves the use of}} two metal ions in the active site, and a region in the active site that can discriminate between deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. The metal ions are general divalent cations that help the 3' OH initiate a nucleophilic attack onto the alpha phosphate of the <b>deoxyribonucleotide</b> and orient and stabilize the negatively charged triphosphate on the <b>deoxyribonucleotide.</b> Nucleophilic attack by the 3' OH on the alpha phosphate releases pyrophosphate, which is then subsequently hydrolyzed (by inorganic phosphatase) into two phosphates. This hydrolysis drives DNA synthesis to completion.|$|E
50|$|In sequencing, dideoxy{{nucleotides}} are used. These nucleotides {{possess the}} non-canonical sugar dideoxyribose, which lacks 3' hydroxyl group (which accepts the phosphate). It therefore cannot {{bond with the}} next base and terminates the chain, as DNA polymerases cannot distinguish between it and a regular <b>deoxyribonucleotide.</b>|$|E
50|$|Biochemical {{research}} has explored {{its role as}} a DNA replication inhibitor which causes <b>deoxyribonucleotide</b> depletion and results in DNA double strand breaks near replication forks (see DNA repair).

50|$|The {{reduction}} of ribonucleotides to <b>deoxyribonucleotides</b> is catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) {{is an essential}} enzyme for all living organisms since it {{is responsible for the}} last step in the synthesis of the four <b>deoxyribonucleotides</b> (dNTPs) necessary for DNA replication and repair. The reaction also requires two other proteins: thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase. Ribonucleoside diphosphate (NDP) is reduced by thioredoxin to a deoxyribonucleoside diphosphate (dNTP).|$|R
50|$|In the {{synthesis}} of the nucleic acid RNA, adenosine derived from ATP {{is one of the}} four nucleotides incorporated directly into RNA molecules by RNA polymerases. The energy driving this polymerization comes from cleaving off a pyrophosphate (two phosphate groups). The process is similar in DNA biosynthesis, except that ATP is reduced to the <b>deoxyribonucleotide</b> dATP, before incorporation into DNA.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{functions}} in dephosphorylating nucleoside triphosphates, especially the 5′- and 2′(3′)-phosphates of uracil and thymine deoxyribonucleotides (dUMPs and dTMPs). Due to this function, mdN regulates {{the size of}} pyrimidine <b>deoxyribonucleotide</b> pools within mitochondria, {{in conjunction with the}} mitochondrial thymidine kinase, as part of the thymidine (dTTP)/dTMP substrate cycle. Since excess dTTP leads to aberrant mitochondrial DNA replication, the regulatory role of mdN serves to maintain dTTP levels to ensure proper mitochondrial DNA replication.|$|E
50|$|Cytosine is a {{nucleotide}} that {{is present}} in both DNA and RNA. However, uracil is only found in RNA. Therefore, after UTP is synthesized, it is must be converted into a deoxy form to be incorporated into DNA. This conversion involves the enzyme ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase. This reaction that removes the 2’-OH of the ribose sugar to generate deoxyribose is not affected by the bases attached to the sugar. This non-specificity allows ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase to convert all nucleotide triphosphates to <b>deoxyribonucleotide</b> by a similar mechanism.|$|E
40|$|A new column, Dionex AS 4 A, (polystyrenedivinylbenzene matrix) {{used for}} the {{separation}} of ribonucleotides and <b>deoxyribonucleotides</b> for the first time, and previously used for ion analysis was found superior to conventional silica columns because it separates ribonucleotides and <b>deoxyribonucleotides.</b> Resolution of dGTP was not possible with the Dionex column and CTP and GDP often co-eluted. Using conventional silica columns, monophosphates separated from diphosphates and diphosphates from triphosphates. Using the new Dionex column resolves all three simultaneously. The Dionex column resolved nucleotides with sharper peaks than silica columns, and the longer its retention time the better was the resolution. This Dionex column is stable, with 80 runs possible without cleaning while resolving ribonucleotides and <b>deoxyribonucleotides</b> to the picomole level...|$|R
40|$|Lactobacillus acidophilus R- 26 {{a strain}} {{deficient}} in ribonucleotide reductase, was grown with [G- 14 C]deoxycytidine {{as the only}} source of deoxyribose in the medium. Of the radioactivity incorporated into deoxyribonucleic acid, a fifth moved directly into deoxyribonucleic acid deoxycytidylate, without deamination. Furthermore, deoxycytidine and thymidine nucleotides had similar sugar/base ratios, suggesting a direct conversion of deoxycytidine nucleotides to thymidine nucleotides through deamination, without further dilution by glycosyl transfer. Although radioactivity was incorporated into both the sugar and base moieties of deoxyribonucleic acid pyrimidine <b>deoxyribonucleotides,</b> only the sugar moiety of purine <b>deoxyribonucleotides</b> was labeled. Purine <b>deoxyribonucleotides</b> probably were synthesized by glycosyl transfer from [G- 14 C]deoxycytidine to unlabeled purines, followed by phosphorylation of the deoxynucleotides...|$|R

50|$|In biochemistry, a {{ribonucleotide}} or ribotide is a nucleotide containing ribose as its pentose component. It {{is considered}} a molecular precursor of nucleic acids. Nucleotides are the basic building blocks of DNA and RNA. The monomer itself from ribonucleotides forms the basic building blocks for RNA. However, the reduction of ribonucleotide, by enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), forms <b>deoxyribonucleotide,</b> which is the essential building block for DNA. There are several differences between DNA deoxyribonucleotides and RNA ribonucleotides. Successive nucleotides are linked together via phosphodiester bonds by 3'-5'.|$|E
50|$|A {{microwell}} {{containing a}} template DNA strand to be sequenced is flooded {{with a single}} species of <b>deoxyribonucleotide</b> triphosphate (dNTP). If the introduced dNTP is complementary to the leading template nucleotide, it is incorporated into the growing complementary strand. This causes {{the release of a}} hydrogen ion that triggers an ISFET ion sensor, which indicates that a reaction has occurred. If homopolymer repeats are present in the template sequence, multiple dNTP molecules will be incorporated in a single cycle. This leads to a corresponding number of released hydrogens and a proportionally higher electronic signal.|$|E
50|$|The siDNA family, led by Dbait {{consists}} of 32 base pairs <b>deoxyribonucleotide</b> forming an intramolecular double helix, which mimicks DNA double-strand break lesions. Dbait binds to and hyperactivate DNA-PK, an enzyme involved in DNA breaks signaling and repair. DNA-PK hyperactivation induces pan-nuclear phosphorylation of histone H2AX {{among all the}} chromatin. H2AX phosphorylation is the signal, which allows double-strand break repair proteins (from NHEJ and Homologous recombination pathways) to form DNA repair complexes selectively on DNA double-strand breaks. Dbait-dependent unspecific phosphorylation of H2AX results in inefficient double strand break recognition and repair.|$|E
50|$|To {{illustrate}} this equation, dATP and dGTP are synthesized from ADP and GTP, respectively. They are first reduced by RNR and then phosphorylated by nucleoside diphosphokinases to dATP and dGTP. For pyrimidine <b>deoxyribonucleotides</b> however, UDP is first converted to dUDP {{and then to}} dTMP and dCTP. This reaction is controlled by allosteric interactions. Once dATP binds to ribonucleotide reductase, the overall catalytic activity of the enzyme decreases, as it signifies an abundance of <b>deoxyribonucleotides.</b> This feedback inhibition is reversed once ATP binds.|$|R

50|$|HrrF RNA (Haemophilus {{regulatory}} RNA {{responsive to}} iron Fe) {{is a small}} non-coding RNA involved in iron homeostasis in Haemophilus species. Orthologues exist only among other Pasteurellacae. Iron- regulated sRNAs JA01- JA04 were identified in related Aggregatibacter. It is an analog to PrrF and RyhB RNAs. HrrF is maximally expressed when iron levels are low. Ferric uptake regulator (Fur) binds upstream of the hrrF promoter. HrrF stability is not dependant on the RNA chaperone Hfq. RNA-seq has shown that that HrrF targets are mRNAs of genes whose products are involved in molybdate uptake, <b>deoxyribonucleotide</b> synthesis, and amino acid synthesis.|$|E
5000|$|Dideoxynucleotides {{are used}} in {{sequencing}} [...] These nucleoside triphosphates possess a non-canonical sugar, dideoxyribose, which lacks the 3' hydroxyl group normally present in DNA and therefore cannot bond with the next base. The lack of the 3' hydroxyl group terminates the chain reaction as the DNA polymerases mistake it for a regular <b>deoxyribonucleotide.</b> Another chain-terminating analogue that lacks a 3' hydroxyl and mimics adenosine is called cordycepin. Cordycepin is an anticancer drug that targets RNA replication. Another analogue in sequencing is a nucleobase analogue, 7-deaza-GTP and is used to sequence CG rich regions, instead 7-deaza-ATP is called tubercidin, an antibiotic.|$|E
50|$|Both prokaryotic and {{eukaryotic}} H2 enzymes can cleave single ribonucleotides in a strand. {{however, they}} have slightly different cleavage patterns and substrate preferences: prokaryotic enzymes have lower processivity and hydrolyze successive ribonucleotides {{more efficiently than}} ribonucleotides with a 5' <b>deoxyribonucleotide,</b> while eukaryotic enzymes are more processive and hydrolyze both types of substrate with similar efficiency. The substrate specificity of RNase H2 gives it a role in ribonucleotide excision repair, removing misincorporated ribonucleotides from DNA, in addition to R-loop processing. Although both H1 and H2 {{are present in the}} mammalian cell nucleus, H2 is the dominant source of RNase H activity there and is important for maintaining genome stability.|$|E
40|$|Degradation of {{pyrimidine}} deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates plays a {{major role}} in the regulation of their pool sizes in 3 T 6 cells. During normal growth, these cells excrete deoxyribonucleosides (mostly deoxyuridine) into the medium.

This effect appears to be caused by a large drop in the size of the intracellular dUMP pool. We propose that substrate cycles, involving phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides by kinases and dephosphorylation of deoxyribonucleoside 5 '-phosphates by a nucleotidase, participate in the regulation of the size of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools by directing the flow of deoxyribonucleosides across the cell membrane. While kinases are regulated mainly by allosteric effects, the activity of the nucleotidase appears to be regulated by substrate concentration...|$|R

At a 0. 4 : 1 sDNA/enzyme ratio, sDNA was the most active coenzyme for monoADP-ribosylation. At 200 μM NAD+, resulting in polymer synthesis and with histones as secondary polymer acceptors, duplex C was the most active coenzyme, and the octamer containing the steroid hormone receptor binding consensus sequence of DNA was a close second, whereas sDNA exhibited an anomalous biphasic kinetics. sDNA was effective on mono- ADP-ribosylation at a concentration 150 – 200 -times lower than on polymer formation. When comparison of <b>deoxyribonucleotides</b> was based on method ii (kD values), by far the most efficiently binding coenzyme for both mono and polymer synthesis was sDNA, followed by duplex C, with (dA-dT) 8 exhibiting the weakest binding.
