5|$|He was {{expected}} {{by some to}} mount a challenge for promotion to the Premiership in 2005–06, which was the club's first season in the new Ricoh Arena. The team started out poorly, but improved {{in the second half}} of the season to rise up the table, with Adams making an inspired signing in Dennis Wise. However, despite excellent home form, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> guide Coventry as high as 8th, missing out on a play-off place by only two league places, though several points adrift of that year's standard.|$|E
5|$|In WWE's {{documentary}} CM Punk: Best in the World {{released in}} 2012, {{it was documented}} from the out-of-universe perspective that a disenchanted Punk rejected signing a new contract with WWE {{for more than a}} year leading up to Money in the Bank. After being persuaded by Joey Mercury and Lars Frederiksen that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> help wrestlers underappreciated by WWE (like himself) if he stayed, Punk signed a new contract with WWE about an hour before capturing the WWE Championship from Cena, while the pay-per-view event was ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Of the First Test team, all bar Toshack scored {{multiple}} first-class {{centuries in}} their careers, and all averaged under 27.50 with the ball. As Bradman wanted all four spin techniques covered, {{as well as}} both left and right-arm seamers, this also meant that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> have two fast bowlersLindwall and Milleras three positions were occupied by spinners and a fourth by Toshack, who was of medium pace.|$|E

5|$|Renoart of Nephin pillaged the {{countryside}} and led his troops to Tripoli in late 1204. Bohemond lost an eye in a battle {{at the gates of}} the town. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> crush the rebellion after Aimery of Cyprus and Jerusalem died in April 1205. He captured both Nephin and Gibelcar {{before the end of the}} year, forcing Renart to flee to Cyprus. Before long, Bohemond returned to Antioch.|$|E
5|$|The {{struggle}} between Basiliscus and Zeno impeded the Eastern Roman Empire's ability {{to intervene in}} the fall of the Western Roman Empire, which happened in early September 476. When the chieftain of the Heruli, Odoacer, deposed Western Emperor Romulus Augustus, sending the imperial regalia to Constantinople, Zeno had just regained his throne, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> appoint Odoacer dux of Italy, thereby ending the Western Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|After 1462 Wallachia {{preserved}} its autonomy {{mainly through}} {{the intervention of}} Stephen the Great of Moldavia. At {{the end of the}} century, however, Radu IV the Great (14951508) became an obedient subject of the sultan and visited Istanbul annually to personally offer the tribute. Even so, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> stay in power by collaborating with the powerful Craioveşti family, strongly connected to the Ottomans by trading. In 1512 a member of this family, Neagoe (15121521) rose to throne, but he adopted the dynastic name of Basarab in order to legitimize his rule. He wrote the first original work of Romanian literature, titled Teachings, to his son, Teodosius on moral, political, and military questions.|$|E

5|$|Amir's brigade {{began to}} reach the plain between Artillery Road and the Firdan bridge at 09:00. So far no Egyptian {{resistance}} of any significance had been encountered. The brigade had the objective of attacking 2nd Division's bridgehead. Abu Sa'ada, the division commander, had the 24th Armored Brigade as the divisional reserve, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> commit it {{in case of an}} Israeli penetration. Gonen wanted Adan {{to reach the}} Hizayon strongpoint, and contacted Elazar in Tel Aviv at 09:55 to request a crossing of the canal. Gonen either downplayed or ignored negative reports and only told Elazar of positive developments. Elazar, who was at a meeting, communicated with Gonen through his assistant and approved of a crossing, also giving permission for Sharon's division to move south.|$|E
5|$|Barrow became {{manager of}} the Boston Red Sox in 1918. As the team lost many of its better players during World War I, Barrow {{encouraged}} owner Harry Frazee to purchase Stuffy McInnis, Wally Schang, Bullet Joe Bush, and Amos Strunk from the Philadelphia Athletics for $75,000 ($ in current dollar terms). During the season, Barrow feuded with his assistant, Johnny Evers, who undermined Barrow's leadership. The Red Sox won the 1918 World Series. Recognizing that star pitcher Babe Ruth was also a great power hitter, Barrow had Ruth pinch hit on days when he wasn't scheduled to pitch. When Ruth told Barrow that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> pitch or hit, Barrow decided that Ruth's bat was more useful than his pitching, and transitioned him from a pitcher into an outfielder.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century English chivalric {{ideas of}} selfless {{service to the}} king had been corrupted. Armed forces were mostly raised through musters in {{individual}} estates; every able-bodied man had to respond to his lord's call to arms, and each noble had exclusive authority over his militia. Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> muster a significantly large army through {{the support of his}} nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships. Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege's side or else they might turn against him. Three groups, each with its own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.|$|E
50|$|Augustus, having {{decided that}} those whom <b>he</b> exiled <b>could</b> <b>only</b> reside on islands more than 400 stadia (50 km) from the continent, the Cyclades became places of exile, chiefly Gyaros, Amorgos and Serifos.|$|R

5|$|Despite United's early pressure, it was Barcelona {{who scored}} the first {{goal of the}} match. Edwin van der Sar cleared the ball downfield for Manchester United, but it was headed away by Barcelona's midfield anchor Sergio Busquets. Carrick was first to the ball for Manchester United, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> head {{it as far as}} Xavi, who passed to Andrés Iniesta. The Manchester United defence backed away from the Spaniard, who – after exchanging passes with Lionel Messi – played the ball into the path of Samuel Eto'o in the Manchester United penalty area. Nemanja Vidić {{attempted}} to shepherd the Cameroonian striker towards the goal line, but Eto'o easily stepped inside him and toe-poked the ball past Van der Sar to make it 1–0 to Barcelona inside 10minutes.|$|E
5|$|During September and October of the 1999–2000 season, Boulding {{scored in}} four {{successive}} league games. However, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> score another two goals {{during the rest}} of the campaign to once again record a tally of six goals. His last goal came only two minutes after he had come on as a substitute during Mansfield's penultimate game of the season against Scunthorpe United, which helped the team to their fourth successive home victory and a final league position of 13th. Boulding's two-year contract with Mansfield had finished and he left after playing 74appearances in all competitions for Mansfield, of which 41 were as a substitute. During his two seasons he scored 12goals, all in the league.|$|E
5|$|Grace's final {{appearance}} in 1878 {{was for the}} USEE against Twenty of Essex in a two-day match at Witham, starting on Friday, 13 September. The game was played {{for the benefit of}} the Essex and USEE stalwart Frank Silcock. Essex at this time was not a first-class club but capable of providing the USEE with a stern test, especially with odds in their favour, and they had by far the best of a drawn game. Essex scored 175 and 235; USEE replied with 134 and 65–5, so Essex would almost certainly have won with more time. Grace starred with the ball and took a total of 26 wickets. But his indifferent form with the bat haunted him right to the end of the season and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> score 10 and 4.|$|E

5|$|In 1043 Edward {{appointed}} Stigand to the see of Elmham. Four {{years later}} he {{was appointed to the}} see of Winchester, and then in 1052 to the archdiocese of Canterbury, which Stigand held jointly with Winchester. Five successive popes, including Nicholas II and Alexander II, excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury. Stigand was present at the deathbed of King Edward and at the coronation of Harold Godwinson as king of England in 1066. After Harold's death, Stigand submitted to William the Conqueror. On Christmas Day 1066 Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, crowned William King of England. Stigand's excommunication meant that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> assist at the coronation.|$|E
5|$|Inexplicably, Generals Floyd and Pillow were upbeat {{about the}} day's {{performance}} and wired General Johnston at Nashville {{that they had}} won a great victory. Buckner, however, argued {{that they were in}} a desperate position that was getting worse with the arrival of Union reinforcements. At their final council of war in the Dover Hotel at 1:30a.m. on February 16, Buckner stated that if C.F. Smith attacked again, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> hold for thirty minutes, and he estimated that the cost of defending the fort would be as high as a seventy-five percent casualty rate. Buckner's position finally carried the meeting. Any large-scale escape would be difficult. Most of the river transports were currently transporting wounded men to Nashville and would not return in time to evacuate the command.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 1917 McCudden scored {{his first}} victory as an {{official}} member of 56 Squadron over an Albatros D.V. Another the following day and two on 20 August raised his tally from 7 to 11 victories. He was pleased with his success but berated the armourers for the frequent gun-stoppages. Over the next four weeks his machine suffered engine difficulties and gun-jams. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> claim damaged enemy aircraft and once suffered a galling experience when the DFW C.V reconnaissance he was attacking holed his engine while his guns jammed. It had to be sent for major repairs. He received a new fighter, B4863, which then became his regular mount.|$|E

5|$|On April 10, 2008, Ice {{was arrested}} in Palm Beach County on a battery charge for {{allegedly}} kicking and hitting his wife. He was released the following day after she declared {{that her husband had}} only pushed her. In court, the couple's neighbor, Frank Morales, stated that it was merely a verbal argument. Ice was ordered by a Florida court to stay away from his wife following his arrest, and to communicate with his children only if Morales accompanied him. The judge told Ice that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> contact his wife via telephone. On April 29, 2008, Ice's lawyers, Bradford Cohen and Joseph LoRusso, were able to get the case dropped after providing the state attorney with evidence that conflicted with what was originally reported.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was {{too weak}} to move any farther. Norris was well aware of the {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he {{would have to go to}} him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in New York over 23 days in March 2014. Most of the film was shot in a townhouse on West 162nd Street in Manhattan. Some scenes were filmed in an apartment building in Yonkers and a senior's home in Hastings-on-Hudson. The film was shot by French cinematographer Denis Lenoir, whom Glatzer and Westmoreland had met at a film screening in 1999; they had {{wanted to work with}} him ever since. During filming, Glatzer and Westmoreland attempted to divide the directing duties equally between themselves, even though Glatzer's physical condition had deteriorated to the point that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>only</b> communicate by typing on an iPad with a single finger.|$|E
