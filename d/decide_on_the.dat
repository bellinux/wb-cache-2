5|$|As Baghdad {{raised the}} spectre of an {{extensive}} network of British spies, the group again split. Pratap and von Hentig's party left on 1 June 1915 {{to make their}} way towards the Persian border. Eight days later they were received by the Turkish military commander Rauf Orbay at the Persian town of Krynd. Leaving Krynd, the party reached Turkish-occupied Kermanshah on 14 June 1915. Some members were sick with malaria and other tropical diseases. Leaving them under the care of Dr. Becker, von Hentig proceeded towards Tehran to <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subsequent plans with Prince Heinrich Reuss and Niedermayer.|$|E

This surprises Bill and Marty, who believed that nobody would ever choose an elephant, and thus have no elephant to give away. They offer Bart {{a variety of other}} prizes, all of which he refuses. Word spreads throughout town about Bill and Marty's refusal to give Bart an elephant, prompting their boss to give them a choice: either arrange for delivery of the elephant, or lose their jobs.

5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was to <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and {{his understanding of the}} former made his advice invaluable.|$|E
5|$|The verdict (8 November 2013) and {{sentence}} (6 December 2013) {{were both}} {{delivered at the}} Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire. The judge advocate (the civilian judge heading the panel at a court-martial) was Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett. The verdict carried with it a mandatory life sentence, so {{it was only in}} the judge advocate's and court-martial board's power to <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> minimum sentence once the board had found Blackman guilty. He was sentenced to a minimum of 10 years in prison. On 22 May 2014, at the Courts Martial Appeal Court, its most senior judge, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, upheld the life sentence, but reduced Blackman's minimum term to 8 years.|$|E
5|$|To {{cope with}} the ongoing war situation, Charles had {{introduced}} martial law to large swathes of the country; he extended this during 1626 and 1627, as the financial constraints imposed by Parliament began to cut into pay, leading to soldiers rioting. Under {{the law of the}} time, martial law was declared by the local military commander, at which point a group of Commissioners would be empowered to <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> facts of offences, before passing the case to the commander, who would pass judgment. In practice, things worked completely differently. In Dover, the forces were commanded by Lord Conway, who declared martial law. Not only were commissioners authorised to <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> facts, they were also permitted to authorise summary judgments, including the execution of people they deemed to be guilty. In addition, the commissioners were given the power not only to resolve billeting disputes between soldiers and civilians, but to order civilians to provide quarters for the troops. A later declaration of martial law in Portsmouth extended the commission's remit yet again, allowing for civilians to be tried under martial law and, if necessary, sentenced to death. Even this did not solve the problems, as soldiers would often wander outside the jurisdiction of the commissioners; to deal with this, February 1627 saw a Provost Marshal introduced to each county, bringing the entire nation under martial law.|$|E

5|$|Today, Haifa {{is governed}} by its 12th city council, headed by the mayor Yona Yahav. The results of {{municipal}} elections <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> makeup of the council, similarly to the Knesset elections. The city council is the legislative council in the city, and {{has the authority to}} pass auxiliary laws. The 12th council, which was elected in 2003, has 31 members, with the liberal Shinui-Greens ticket holding the most seats (6), and Likud coming second with 5. Many of the decisions passed by the city council are results of recommendation made by the various municipal committees, which are committees where non-municipal organs meet with representatives from the city council. Some committees are spontaneous, but some are mandatory, such as the security committee, tender committee and financial committee.|$|E
5|$|According to Baley, {{political}} and economic factors prompted two Hedgpeth and two Baley families to leave northwestern Missouri for California in early 1858. One factor was {{the enactment of the}} Kansas-Nebraska Act, which admitted Nebraska into the Union as a free territory and granted Kansas the right to <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> legality of slavery within the state. The resulting tensions between pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups fueled conflict near the Missouri state line, affecting its western counties, including Nodaway, where the Baleys and Hedgpeths lived. In Baley's opinion, the financial Panic of 1857 further contributed to instability in the region, driving many mid-westerners to seek a better life in California. The combined Baley-Hedgpeth outfits were led by a forty-four-year-old veteran of the Black Hawk War, Gillum Baley, and comprised eight Murphy wagons, sixty-two oxen, seventy-five head of cattle, and several riding horses. They employed half-a-dozen grubstakers to tend their stock.|$|E
5|$|For {{refusing to}} {{contribute}} to the forced loan, over 70 gentlemen were arbitrarily jailed, without trial or charges brought against them. Five of them, Sir Thomas Darnell, Sir John Corbet, Sir Walter Erle, Sir John Heveningham and Sir Edmund Hampden, attempted to gain their freedom, petitioning the Court of King's Bench for a writ of habeas corpus. These were awarded on 3 November 1627, with the court ordering the bailiffs to present these prisoners to the King's Bench for examination by 8 November. None of the prisoners were presented, because the bailiffs were unable to determine what they were charged with; in an attempt to get a test case to <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> legality of the forced loans, the Attorney General Sir Robert Heath secured a writ for Darnell. This led to the Five Knights' Case, known as Darnell's Case. Darnell, unnerved by the situation, ceased pursuing his freedom, and the other four secured writs instead, represented by John Bramston, Henry Calthorp and John Selden.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, the Autism Resource Centre (ARC) {{launched}} {{a project to}} provide comprehensive support for autistic Singaporeans, which included plans {{to set up the}} first autism-focused special school in Singapore. The ARC collaborated with the Rainbow Centre over a period of five months to renovate the temporary campus, recruit school staff, <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> school values and develop the school programmes. After opening in 2004 with 10 teachers and 41 students, Pathlight School conducted charity walks, merchandise sales and other events to raise funds for the introduction of more programmes for an expanding intake. In 2007, two teachers from Pathlight School won the inaugural Most Outstanding Special Education Teacher Award and Most Innovative Special Education Teacher Award, given by the Singaporean Ministry of Education and National Council of Social Service. In 2009, the Autism Association of Singapore {{launched a}} second autism-focused special school, Eden School, and the two schools formed a partnership. The following year, Pathlight School moved to its permanent campus and announced plans to develop student internship programmes, build an information technology centre, and set up a lifelong learning club for alumni.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Submarine Corporation {{construction}} {{facility was}} established on previously undeveloped {{land on the}} bank of the Port River, at Osborne, South Australia. Work on the site began on 29 June 1987, and it was opened in November 1989. South Australia was selected as the site of the construction facility based on the proposed location of the facility and promises by the State Government to help minimise any problems caused by workers unions. The state's bid was aided by careful promotion to both Kockums and IKL/HDW during early in the project, and problems with the other states' proposals: Tasmania and Western Australia lacked the necessary industrial base, New South Wales could not <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> location of the construction facility, Victoria's proposed site was poorly sited, and building in Liberal-led Queensland would have been politically unwise for the project when Labor was in power both federally and in all other states.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Ali {{spent his}} last years in Umbai, Malacca, and {{supported}} {{himself with a}} small monthly stipend which the British East India Company had granted him. He built a palace for himself and lived with his third wife, Cik' Sembuk {{until his death in}} June 1877, and was buried in a Mausoleum {{within the confines of the}} Umbai mosque. Shortly before his death, Sultan Ali willed the Kesang territory to Tengku Mahmood, his 11-year-old son with Cik' Sembuk. His decision was met with considerable disproval among the some Malays in Singapore, who felt that Tengku Alam should be the heir to the Kesang territory as he was the oldest son with Daing Siti, who was the daughter of a Bugis nobleman, while Cik' Sembuk was a commoner. At the time of Sultan Ali's death, custody of the Kesang territory lay in the hands of Ungku Jalil, Sultan Ali's elder brother. Ungku Jalil handed over the custodianship of the Kesang territory to Maharaja Abu Bakar, after the British government held an election for the Temenggong Paduka Tuan of Muar and the territory's chieftains to <b>decide</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> destiny of the Kesang territory, and voted unanimously for Maharaja Abu Bakar as their leader. The British Governor handed over administrative charge of the Kesang territory over to the Maharaja, which upset Tengku Alam and many of his supporters. Their continued claims to the Kesang territory led to the instigation of the Jementah Civil War in 1879.|$|E
