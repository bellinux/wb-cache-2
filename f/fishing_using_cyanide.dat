40|$|A survey made at {{the landing}} centres north of Madras Fisheries Harbour upto Ennore {{revealed}} that the local fishermen use some chemical for fishing in areas with rocky bottoms and boulders mostly during rough seas. Since the chemical contains cyanide and lead {{there is no doubt}} that the chemical complex material is a health hazard not only to the local fishermen but also to those consumers who use the fish for food. Investigations revealead that more and more fishermen resort to toxic and poisonous agents to narcotize the fish in their environments and catch them since it is an easy way without involving expenditure or much fishing effort. This method of <b>fishing</b> <b>using</b> <b>cyanide</b> and lead containing products will pose a health problem even to those fishermen in the long run by their constant handling of these chemicals...|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the bluespotted ribbontail ray as Near Threatened. Although still relatively common and widely distributed, this species faces continuing degradation of its coral reef habitat throughout its range, from development and destructive <b>fishing</b> practices <b>using</b> <b>cyanide</b> or dynamite. In addition, its populations are under heavy pressure by artisanal and commercial fisheries, and by local collecting for the aquarium trade.|$|R
50|$|Polgas soon {{learns that}} {{mainland}} Chinese frequently entered and illegally <b>fished</b> Palawan waters <b>using</b> <b>cyanide</b> and dynamite.

Using the satellite phone built into his garapata gun, Polgas calls Khalid, the former Muslim pirate he had befriended, and asks for the Red Marlin Group's help in stopping the illegal fishermen. He then calls OCB headquarters and requests that a special package be shipped to his current location. Needless to say, Polgas then assumes his Dobermaxx persona.|$|R
40|$|Destructive <b>fishing</b> such as <b>using</b> <b>cyanide</b> in {{capture of}} {{ornamental}} fish has caused {{damage to the}} coral reefs, this is suggested the use of clove oil which considered eco-friendly fishing. This study aims to analyze the changes of color, zooxanthellae density and mitotic index of coral Porites lobata after exposure to several concentrations of clove oil. Experimental design was a factorial design, which consists of six concentrations and five time treatments with 3 replication. Coral was placed into the 1. 0 x 0. 5 x 1. 0 m aquarium that contains clove oil solution in different concentrations (control, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 ppm) for 5 min and then transferred to a tank containing clean seawater for 60 seconds and then removed to tanks for the recovery process. Observation was made everyday for coral color changes in 17 days period and on day 1, 5, 9, 13 and 17 for zooxanthellae density and mitotic index. The {{results showed that the}} were no changes in Porites lobata colors until the 17 th day after exposure to 20 ???????? 60 ppm of clove oil and {{there was no significant difference}} in the zooxanthellae density and mitotic index of the Porites lobata on concentration variation, while zooxanthellae densities and mitotic index showed significant difference on time (day) variation. This suggested that exposure to clove oil at a concentration of 20 ???????? 60 ppm did not affect the color change, zooxanthellae density and mitotic index of Porites lobata...|$|R

50|$|This is {{especially}} harmful to island {{nations such as}} Samoa, Indonesia, and the Philippines, because many people there depend on the coral reef ecosystems to feed their families {{and to make a}} living. However, many fishermen are unable to catch as many <b>fish</b> as they <b>used</b> to, so they are increasingly <b>using</b> <b>cyanide</b> and dynamite in fishing, which further degrades the coral reef ecosystem. This perpetuation of bad habits simply leads to the further decline of coral reefs and therefore perpetuates the problem. One way of stopping this cycle is by educating the local community about why the conservation of marine spaces that include coral reefs is important. Once the local communities understand the personal stakes, then they will fight to preserve the reefs. Conserving coral reefs has many economic, social, and ecological benefits, not only for the people who live on these islands, but for people throughout the world.|$|R
