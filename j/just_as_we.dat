5|$|A {{narrative}} rational for {{the concept}} of Hell {{can be found in}} the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. This narrative ends with Yudhishthira's visit to hell after being offered acceptance into heaven. This journey creates a scene for the audience that helps illustrate the importance of understanding hell as well as heaven before accepting either extreme. This idea provides an essential lesson regarding Dharma, a primary theme within the Mahabharata. Dharma is not a black and white concept, and all people are not entirely good or entirely evil. As such, tolerance is essential in order to truly understand the “right way of living”. We all must understand the worst to truly understand and appreciate the best <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> must experience the best before we can experience the worst. This narrative utilizes the Hindu religion in order to teach lessons on tolerance and acceptance of one another's faults as well as virtues.|$|E
5|$|The work {{ends with}} the {{following}} words: Fichte and the powerful men who have inherited his ideals, when they see children, think: 'Here is material that I can manipulate'... All this, to any person with natural affection for the young, is horrible; <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> teach children to avoid being destroyed by motor cars if they can, so we should teach them to avoid being destroyed by cruel fanatics... This is the task of a liberal education: to {{give a sense of}} the value of things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free community, and through the combination of citizenship with liberty in individual creativeness to enable men to give to human life that splendour which some few have shown that it can achieve (Russell 1938:251).|$|E
25|$|<b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have co-adaptation, {{there is}} also co{{extinction}}. Coextinction {{is the loss of}} a species due to the extinction of another with which it is coadapted, as with the extinction of parasitic insects following the loss of their hosts, or when a flowering plant loses its pollinator, or when a food chain is disrupted.|$|E

[...] This line is often misheard, and mis-transcribed, <b>as</b> [...] "dance <b>just</b> <b>as</b> good <b>as</b> <b>we</b> walk". Asked to clarify by writer Michael Corcoran, Archie Bell responded, [...] "We dance <b>just</b> <b>as</b> good <b>as</b> <b>we</b> want. Hell, we dance {{a lot better than}} we walk." ...|$|R

But we're not looking to have a debate on whether fighting is good or bad or should be part of the game." ...|$|E

[...] When asked by reporters about the conversation, Palin said that she would [...] "keep a sense of humor through all of this, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> [...] did with SNL , too."

500|$|In {{his review}} of Harrison's 2014 Apple reissues, Paul Trynka of Classic Rock cites [...] "Run of the Mill" [...] as [...] "the perfect example" [...] of how All Things Must Pass still [...] "sounds fresh despite its familiarity". Trynka continues: [...] "Like many of Harrison's songs, the opening and chords are sweet, {{reassuringly}} recognisable, but <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> settle down the melody skips away, aided by his trademark trick of a brief switch of time signature. It's dazzling craftsmanship – yet sweet and unforced." ...|$|E

500|$|Neutral monism, in philosophy, is the meta{{physical}} {{view that the}} mental and the physical are two ways of organizing or describing the same elements, which are themselves [...] "neutral", that is, neither physical nor mental. [...] This view denies that the mental and the physical are two fundamentally different things. Rather, neutral monism claims the universe consists of only one kind of stuff, {{in the form of}} neutral elements that are in themselves neither mental nor physical. These neutral elements might have the properties of color and shape, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> experience those properties. But these shaped and colored elements do not exist in a mind (considered as a substantial entity, whether dualistically or physicalistically); they exist on their own.|$|E

500|$|The Kazon were {{inspired}} by Los Angeles gangs, and were referenced in a [...] "shorthand 'Crips' and 'Bloods' fashion". The idea for the Kazon as warrior sects, {{as opposed to a}} unified race, was introduced by Taylor, who drafted them as [...] "three gangs, with constantly shifting relationships and allegiances. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> think we have sorted it out, the balance shifts again." [...] While discussing the Kazon's original inspiration, Taylor viewed them as a way [...] "to address the tenor of our times and what [...] was happening in our cities and recognizing a source of danger and social unrest". Piller further described the premise for the Kazon as rooted in gang violence and warfare by clarifying: [...] "Our intention was to create a sort of disorganized anarchy, them-against-them as much as them-against-us." ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to conceive of disconnected spacetimes, each existing but unable to interact with one another. An easily visualized metaphor {{is a group of}} separate soap bubbles, in which observers living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles, even in principle. According to one common terminology, each [...] "soap bubble" [...] of spacetime is denoted as a universe, whereas our particular spacetime is denoted as the Universe, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> call our moon the Moon. The entire collection of these separate spacetimes is denoted as the multiverse. With this terminology, different Universes are not causally connected to each other. In principle, the other unconnected Universes may have different dimensionalities and topologies of spacetime, different forms of matter and energy, and different physical laws and physical constants, although such possibilities are purely speculative. Others consider each of several bubbles created as part of chaotic inflation to be separate Universes, though in this model these universes all share a causal origin.|$|E
500|$|After {{the more}} {{produced}} Rings Around the World, which {{relied heavily on}} computers and electronics, the group were keen to make Phantom Power [...] "a little more human" [...] with guitarist Huw Bunford stating: [...] "with technology {{you can do anything}} these days, but sometimes less is more". Many songs on the album are acoustic based and bass player Guto Pryce has claimed that they sounded [...] "pretty good right from the start" [...] which also contributed to the decision to avoid [...] "over-tweak them in the studio". Despite this the group did work electronic loops into several tracks after Ciaran bought a large number of [...] "sound effect and light music" [...] vinyl records from a man who worked in the same building. According to Rhys: [...] "he knocked on the door <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were beginning the album: [...] "hey, I've got these records to sell, are ya interested?" [...] And Cian went down to check them out and gave him a hundred pounds on the spot and carried 700 albums back to our tiny room".|$|E

500|$|Parker {{also said}} he and Stone {{purposely}} wrote the episode to present Jesus as the hero from a [...] "humanist approach"; Clasquin said this is demonstrated {{by the fact that}} Jesus becomes caught up in people's expectations for the fight and becomes offended when people bet against him: [...] "This satirical gesture beautifully draws attention to the sheer humanity of Jesus. He really is a man, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> are men and women. He is open to fear and uncertainty." [...] Several writers said the episode also lampooned the way Americans can turn anything, even a religious situation, into a commercially hyped event. Matt Zoller Seitz of The Star-Ledger said: [...] "They aren't making fun of organized religion (though they have in the past). They're making fun of those who would turn religion into entertainment and entertainment into a kind of religion." [...] Seitz said the episode mocks [...] "morality cops who misbehave in private" [...] like Priest Maxi, who secretly bets the parish against Jesus even as he admonished congregation members for siding with Satan.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{have placed}} parts the novel in the mystery genre. Edinger found {{that despite the}} broad genres, the novel is mainly [...] "a thrilling puzzle". She relates the pieces slowly; clues {{are found in the}} story itself, on the map, in words and chapter titles. At {{the end of the book}} {{everything}} is tied together and makes sense. Ann Crewdson of School Library Journal found that each note Miranda receives foreshadows the next event. Each note is [...] "skillfully" [...] integrated into the novel, along with subsequent clues, until the climax is reached and all the clues come together. Stead's editor Lamb agreed with the mystery genre, in that [...] "there's plenty to wonder about after you finish the book. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> wonder why our feelings change so suddenly, or why someone like the laughing man appears on the corner one day." [...] Gurdon of The Wall Street Journal concurred with Lamb, adding that although the novel is clearly a mystery, the mystery itself is not revealed until the end where the last note comes and where everything ties together.|$|E
500|$|Maria Amélia and her mother, who had {{accompanied}} her, disembarked on 31 August in Funchal, {{the capital of}} Madeira. The entire town greeted her joyfully, and a crowd followed the princess to her new home. She adored the island and told her mother: [...] "If I one day recover my previous robust health, isn't that so mommy, we will stay {{a long time in}} this island. We will make long excursions in the mountains, we will find new paths, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> did in Stein!" [...] But her health worsened, {{and by the end of}} November, all hope was gone. By the beginning of 1853, the princess was bedridden, and she knew death was approaching: [...] "My strength diminishes from day to day; I can feel it... we are reaching the beginning of the end." [...] A little after midnight in the early hours of 4 February, a priest administered the last rites. Maria Amélia tried to comfort her mother: [...] "Do not cry... let God's will be done; may He come to my aid in my last hour; may He console my poor mother!" [...] She died later that morning at around 04:00.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Wilkinson was an {{opponent}} of imperialism. In February 1927 she attended the Founding Congress of the League Against Imperialism in Brussels, where she met and befriended the Indian nationalist leader Jawaharlal Nehru. In 1927 she {{was elected to the}} Labour Party's National Executive, which gave her a voice in the formulation of party policy. Her advance was noted with approval by Beatrice Webb, who saw in her a future candidate for high office—ahead of more senior Labour women such as Margaret Bondfield and Susan Lawrence. A tireless campaigner for women's equality, she challenged the caricature of voteless younger women as 'flappers'. On 29 March 1928 Wilkinson voted in the House of Commons for the bill that became the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928, granting the vote to all women aged 21 or over. During the debate she said: [...] "e are doing at last a great act of justice to the women of the country... <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have [...] {{opened the door to the}} older women, tonight we are opening it to those who are just entering on the threshold of life and in whose hands is the new life of the future country that we are going to build".|$|E
500|$|In October, Sallal's {{palace in}} San'a was {{attacked}} with a bazooka, and insurgents began targeting an Egyptian army camp {{outside the city}} and setting fire to Egyptian installations, killing a reported 70 Egyptian troops. Sallal arrested about 140 suspects, including Mohamed Ruwainy, the ex-Minister for Tribal Affairs, and Colonel Hadi Issa, former {{deputy chief of staff}} of the armed forces. Sallal accused Ruwainy and Issa of organizing a [...] "subversive network seeking to plunge the country into terrorism and panic" [...] and planning a campaign of assassination, financed by Saudi Arabia, Britain, Israel and the US. Ruwainy, Issa and five others were executed, while eight others received prison sentences ranging from five years to life. In February, 1967, Nasser vowed to [...] "stay in Yemen 20 years if necessary", while Prince Hussein bin Ahmed said [...] "We are [...] prepared to fight for 50 years to keep Nasser out, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> did the Ottoman Turks." [...] Tunisia broke diplomatic relations with the republic, saying that the Sallal government no longer has power to govern the country. Sallal's chargé d'affaires in Czechoslovakia flew to Beirut and announced that he was on his way to offer his services to the royalists. Nasser said that [...] "As the situation now stands, Arab summits are finished forever." ...|$|E
500|$|Interviewed by the Israeli daily {{newspaper}} Haaretz {{about the fact}} that some of her European senior colleagues had formed alliances with, and visited, some Israeli settlers and groups, Marine Le Pen said: [...] "The shared concern about radical Islam explains the relationship ... but it is possible that behind it is also the need of the visitors from Europe to change their image in their countries ... As far as their partners in Israel are concerned, I myself don't understand the idea of continuing to develop the settlements. I consider it a political mistake and would like to make it clear in this context that we must have the right to criticize the policy of the State of Israel – <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> are allowed to criticize any sovereign country – without it being considered anti-Semitism. After all, the National Front has always been Zionistic and always defended Israel's right to exist". She has opposed the immigration of French Jews to Israel in response to radical Islam, explaining: [...] "The Jews of France are Frenchmen, they're at home here, and they must stay here and not emigrate. The country is obligated to provide solutions to the development of radical Islam in the problematic regions".|$|E
