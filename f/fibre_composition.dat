Treatment with PTU decreased body oxygen consumption and the concentration of triiodothyronine in plasma. The capacity of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles' homogenates to oxidize pyruvate plus malate and their cytochrome c oxidase activity were reduced after 21 or 42 days of treatment with PTU. <b>Fibre</b> <b>composition</b> in the soleus muscle was changed by treatment with PTU.

40|$|The insulin {{sensitivity}} of protein synthesis and glucose incorporation into glycogen by the soleus and epitrochlearis muscles from fed rats and 24 h-starved rats was determined in vitro {{during the first}} and second hours of incubation after isolation of the muscles. Rates of protein synthesis by both muscles from fed rats in the first hour of incubation were 2 -fold higher than in the second hour and were not increased by insulin. Rates of protein synthesis during the first hour in the presence of 6000 microunits of insulin/ml were increased in soleus, but not in epitrochlearis, muscles from starved rats. Rates of protein synthesis in both muscles from fed and starved rats were increased significantly by insulin during the second hour. High concentrations of insulin caused a marked stimulation of the rates of glucose incorporation by both muscles from fed and starved rats in both {{the first and second}} hours of incubation. The insulin {{sensitivity of}} glucose incorporation during the second hour, defined as the concentration of insulin causing half-maximal stimulation, was increased 10 -fold for both muscle types from starved rats (soleus, 65 microunits/ml; epitrochlearis, 45 microunits/ml) relative to muscles from fed rats (soleus, 600 microunits/ml; epitrochlearis, 500 microunits/m). The insulin sensitivity of protein synthesis in the second hour was greater for soleus muscles from starved rats (65 microunits/ml) than from fed rats (500 microunits/ml). In contrast, the insulin sensitivity of protein synthesis in epitrochlearis muscles from starved rats was significantly decreased (225 microunits/ml) compared with fed rats (25 microunits/ml Maximal rates achieved by high concentrations of insulin were not different from those in the same muscle from fed rats. It is suggested that protein synthesis, in distinction to glucose utilization, may be resistant to insulin stimulation during periods of acute starvation in muscles with <b>fibre</b> <b>compositions</b> similar to the epitrochlearis, but not in muscles with <b>fibre</b> <b>compositions</b> similar to the soleus.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the relation between}} the vibromyographic (VMG) frequency characteristics and <b>fibre</b> <b>composition</b> in postural and non-postural human muscle undergoing a standardised voluntary contraction. METHODS [...] Two human muscles with different fibre compositions [soleus: postural, mainly type I (slow) fibres; biceps brachii: non-postural, mixed type I and II (fast) fibres] were recorded from 18 healthy males isometrically contracting at 50 % of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Muscle vibrations were recorded using a contact microphone and the frequency content of the signals calculated using fast fourier transform algorithms. RESULTS [...] The non-postural biceps brachii showed predominantly bimodal power spectra with significantly increased power in the 10 - 30 Hz bands (P < 0. 01), as compared with soleus recordings which tended to be unimodal, with the majority of power below 10 Hz. CONCLUSIONS [...] Muscles with a large proportion of type I fibres generate VMG signals which contain an increased percentage of low frequencies as compared to muscles with a mixed population of type I and type II fibres. The VMG appears to be generated, in part at least, by the mechanical twitching of motor units within the muscle; frequency domain analysis of this signal may provide a non-invasive measure of muscle <b>fibre</b> <b>composition...</b>|$|E

METHODS: Thirty-nine male patients with T 2 D, 44 male subjects with IGT and 58 subjects with NGT matched for age, weight and body mass index (BMI) participated in the study. Insulin sensitivity was obtained with hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, muscle fibre distribution with a biopsy and exercise capacity from an incremental exercise test. Anthropometric measurements as height, weight, waist and hip circumference were performed. RESULTS: There were small differences between groups in waist hip ratio (WHR) with significance attained between NGT and T 2 D. There was a progressive reduction in exercise capacity, both expressed as VO(2 peak) and work rate from subjects with NGT to IGT to T 2 D. Multiple regression analysis with VO(2 peak) as dependent variable showed insulin sensitivity to be the most important factor followed by Type I fibres.

40|$|In this review, {{the term}} muscle fibre {{regionalization}} signifies {{the presence of}} regional intramuscular differences in <b>fibre</b> type <b>composition.</b> As is well known, highly regionalized muscles commonly have greater concentrations of slow fibres deep than superficially. However, the degree of regionalization varies markedly between muscles and {{is not confined to}} deep vs. superficial locations. Fibres of the same myosin type may show regionalized differences in their metabolic enzyme activity, even within single motor units (Larsson, 1992). Regionalization of <b>fibre</b> type <b>composition</b> occurs also within single neuromuscular partitions. The intraspinal position of motoneurones is often coarsely related to the intramuscular sites of their muscle units. Muscles with a marked fibre type regionalization tend to show a corresponding regionalization of activity; in several muscles, however, the activity regionalization may vary depending on the motor task. During early development, fibre type regionalization emerges even under aneural conditions. The mechanisms are still unknown; relevant aspects of early development are briefly reviewed...|$|R

One group performed mild exercise, as did a normoxic control group. After hypoxia we investigated <b>fibre</b> type <b>composition,</b> <b>fibre</b> diameter and capillarity of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (e. d. l.) muscles. Mitochondrial volume densities were determined by morphometric analysis. In both e. d. l. and soleus muscle <b>fibre</b> type <b>composition</b> was unchanged and fibre diameter was reduced after hypoxia. Capillary network was unchanged, hence capillary density was increased in both muscles after hypoxia (P less than 0. 05 in untrained soleus). Total mitochondrial volume density was increased in soleus muscle, which was due to an increase in the volume density of intermyofibrillar mitochondria (P less than 0. 05 in the trained group), whereas the volume density of subsarcolemmal mitochondria decreased. In e. d. l. muscle the volume density of both intermyofibrillar and subsarcolemmal mitochondria decreased. We conclude that subsarcolemmal aggregation of mitochondria did not occur after chronic hypoxia. In soleus and e. d. l. muscle, different changes in the volume densities of mitochondria occurred.

The differences between measurements were evaluated using a repeated-measures anova and Scheffé test for post-hoc analysis. Our study showed that the human psoas major muscle was composed of type I, IIA and IIX muscle fibres.

Samples were mounted, frozen and sectioned for histochemical analysis. On the basis of the pH dependent lability of the myosin ATP-ase reaction, fibres were classified as Type I, Type IIA or Type II B. Using computerized planimetry, muscle fibre cross-sectional areas were measured on serial sections stained for succinate dehydrogenase activity. As previously described, muscle strength (maximum voluntary contraction) was correlated with the muscle cross-sectional area (r = 0. 70, P less than 0. 01). The ratio of strength (in N) to cross-sectional area (in cm 2) was 8. 92 +/- 1. 01 (mean +/- S. D.) with a wide range of values, from 7. 09 to 10. 85. Muscle <b>fibre</b> <b>composition</b> of m. vastus lateralis in these subjects was 46. 1 +/- 10. 5 % Type I, 42. 8 +/- 11. 4 % Type IIA and 11. 1 +/- 9. 7 % Type IIB. After correction for differences in the cross-sectional areas of the different fibre types, the proportions of total area occupied by the different fibre types were: 43. 6 +/- 11. 9 % Type I, 46. 4 +/- 13. 1 % Type IIA and 10. 0 +/- 9. 1 % Type IIB. No relationship was observed to exist between muscle strength and muscle <b>fibre</b> <b>composition.</b> Similarly, the muscle strength/cross-sectional area ratio was not related to the proportions of the different fibre types present or to the fraction of the total cross-sectional area occupied by the different fibre types. From the results it can be concluded that there is no difference in the force per unit area which can be generated by the different muscle fibre types present in human skeletal muscle. Variations in muscle <b>fibre</b> <b>composition</b> between individuals cannot, therefore, account for the large variations observed in the ratio of strength to muscle cross-sectional area...|$|E
40|$|Muscle <b>fibre</b> <b>composition</b> and {{capillarity}} {{were evaluated}} in frozen sections stained for myosin ATPase of the soleus {{and the white}} area of the medial head of the gastrocnemius of rats made hyperthyroid by injections of triiodothyronine (300 - 400 micrograms/kg body weight, every other day) for 2, 3 and 4 weeks. O 2 consumption of homogenates of these muscles {{in the presence of}} excess inorganic phosphate (Pi) and ADP with pyruvate and malate as substrates was also measured. Increased oxidative capacity was observed in the soleus homogenates of hyperthyroid animals after 2 weeks of treatment while no changes were observed in the oxidative capacity of the homogenates of the white area of the medial head of the gastrocnemius, even after 4 weeks of treatment. Hyperthyroid animals showed a greater capillarity than controls in both muscles. In the soleus this was evident after 2 weeks of treatment while in the white area of the medial head of the gastrocnemius, it was evident only after 4 weeks of treatment. <b>Fibre</b> <b>composition</b> was affected in the soleus after 4 weeks of treatment. In control animals two fibre types were present in the soleus: slow-twitch oxidative fibres (s. o. or type I fibres) with a high ATPase activity after acid pre-incubation and fast-twitch glycolytic oxidative fibres (f. o. g. or type IIa fibres) with a low ATPase activity after acid pre-incubation. In the soleus of the hyperthyroid animals, a third fibre type with intermediate ATPase activity after acid pre-incubation was also present. This most probably represents a change in the type of myosin being synthesized by some fibres. No changes in <b>fibre</b> <b>composition</b> were observed in the white area of medial head of the gastrocnemius which was made up of only fast-twitch glycolytic fibres (f. g. or type IIb fibres). The changes in oxidative capacity and capillarity in the soleus preceded and {{did not seem to be}} related to the changes in the type of myosin being synthesized. The increased capillarity found in the white area of the medial head of the gastrocnemius of the hyperthyroid animals, in the absence of an increase in the oxidative capacity, indicates that the latter is not the only factor that determines capillarity in skeletal muscle...|$|E
40|$|Reinforcement of {{flexible}} {{fibre reinforced plastic}} (FRP) composites with standard textile fibres is a potential low cost solution to less critical loading applications. The mechanical behaviour of FRPs based on mechanically bonded nonwoven preforms composed of either low or high modulus fibres in a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) matrix were compared following compression moulding. Nonwoven preform <b>fibre</b> <b>compositions</b> were selected from lyocell, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyamide (PA) as well as para-aramid fibres (polyphenylene terephthalamide; PPTA). Reinforcement with standard fibres manifold improved the tensile modulus and strength of the reinforced composites {{and the relationship between}} fibre, fabric and composite’s mechanical properties was studied. The linear density of fibres and the punch density, a key process variable used to consolidate the nonwoven preform, were varied to study the influence on resulting FRP mechanical properties. In summary, increasing the strength and degree of consolidation of nonwoven preforms did not translate to an increase in the strength of resulting fibre reinforced TPU-composites. The TPU composite strength was mainly dependent upon constituent fibre stress-strain behaviour and fibre segment orientation distribution...|$|R
40|$|Skeletal {{muscle is}} {{spatially}} heterogeneous in muscle <b>fibre</b> type <b>composition</b> and microvascular supply. The capacity to quantify this heterogeneity in skeletal muscle is not routinely performed for it’s a laborious and time consuming technique. We {{have developed a}} high throughput data pipeline that utilises the simultaneous immunohistochemical labelling of muscle fibre type and microvascular supply, as an input for a semi-automated analysis software package that allows {{for the analysis of}} fine morphometric indices of <b>fibre</b> type <b>composition</b> and the interactions with microvascular supply. We have successfully shown that regional variation in <b>fibre</b> type <b>composition</b> impacts the functional characteristics of a muscle. After successful characterisation of regional heterogeneity in both structure and function we sought to establish their influence in physiological (adaptive) angiogenesis. Utilising animal angiogenic models we have shown that shear stress driven angiogenesis is principally a stochastic response that does not promote improved oxygen delivery when we analyse the spatial heterogeneity of the neovasculature. Conversely, skeletal muscle overload (abluminal stretch of microvasculature) increases the homogeneity of the oxygen supply area of the capillary bed, suggesting a tissue driven angiogenic response that is not evident in shear stress. Spinal cord injury induced rarefaction of the capillary bed attempts to maintain a homogeneous distribution of fibre size and capillary supply. The combination therapy of epidural stimulation and locomotor training can ameliorate the phenotypic change and rarefied capillary bed seen with spinal cord injury to that of intact levels. Endurance and resistance exercise have a largely similar global genomic response following a chronic training regime, which we are able to replicate in animal models of exercise through indirect electrical stimulation. The shear stress and muscle overload driven angiogenic response have distinctly different angiogenic pathways that contain no commonly expressed networks. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{middle ear}} muscles of {{several species of}} {{carnivores}} (cat, dog, fox, ferret and stone-marten) and some New World monkeys (Callithrix, Saimiri) and Old World monkeys (Cercopithecus, Macaca) were examined. The <b>fibre</b> type <b>compositions</b> of these muscles were determined {{by a combination of}} the standard histochemical myofibrillar ATPase method, and immunohistochemical techniques using myosintype-specific antisera. Immunohistochemically slow-tonic fibres were found in the stapedius muscles of only two carnivores, the ferret and stone-marten. In all the carnivores and the New World monkeys, tensor tympani muscle contained IIM, slow-tonic and slow-twitch fibres, but in the Old World monkeys it resembled stapedius muscle, and contained only Type I (slow-twitch) and IIA fibres. Thus, because all the species examined had IIM fibres in the jaw-closer muscles, this means that the common embryological origin of tensor tympani muscle and the jaw-closers does not necessarily result in tensor tympani muscle containing this fibre type even though IIM fibres occur only in first branchial arch muscles. This fact, together with other species differences in the <b>fibre</b> type <b>composition</b> of these muscles, shows that there is no typical composition of middle ear muscles in general, and suggests that the differences are related to very different functional requirements...|$|R
