40|$|The Columbia Channel (CCS) {{system is}} a depositional system located in the South Brazilian Basin, south of the Vitoria-Trindade {{volcanic}} chain. It lies in a WNW-ESE direction on the continental rise and abyssal plain, {{at a depth of}} between 4200 and 5200 m. It is formed by two depocenters elongated respectively south and north of the channel that show different sediment patterns. The area is swept by a deep western boundary current formed by AABW. The system has been previously interpreted has a mixed turbidite-contourite system. More detailed study of seismic data permits a more precise definition of the modern channel morphology, the system stratigraphy as well as the sedimentary processes and control. The modern CCS presents active erosion and/or transport along the channel. The ancient Oligo-Neogene system overlies a ""upper Cretaceous-Paleogene"" sedimentary substratum (Unit U 1) bounded at the top by a major erosive ""late Eocene-early Oligocene"" discordance (D 2). This ancient system is subdivided into 2 seismic units (U 2 and U 3). The thick basal U 2 unit constitutes the larger part of the system. It consists of three subunits bounded by unconformities: D 3 (""Oligocene-Miocene boundary""), D 4 (""late Miocene"") and D 5 (""late Pliocene""). The subunits have a fairly tabular geometry in the shallow NW depocenter associated with predominant turbidite deposits. They present a mounded shape in the deep NE depocenter, and are interpreted as forming a contourite drift. South of the channel, the deposits are interpreted as a contourite sheet drift. The surficial U 3 unit forms a thin carpet of deposits. The beginning of the channel occurs at the end of U 1 and during the formation of D 2. Its location seems to have been determined by active faults. The channel has been active throughout the late Oligocene and Neogene and its depth increased continuously as a consequence of erosion of the channel floor and deposit aggradation along its margins. Such a mixed turbidite-contourite system (or <b>fan</b> <b>drift)</b> is characterized by frequent, rapid lateral facies variations and by unconformities that cross the whole system and are associated with increased AABW circulation.

50|$|The drive-by {{shooting}} murder of Shakur on September 13, 1996 {{was a major}} turning point for hip-hop as a whole. Shakur had been the West Coast's most popular rapper and among the most critically acclaimed. After his death and Suge Knight's incarceration, Death Row Records - once home {{to the majority of}} the West Coast's mainstream rappers - fell into obscurity. The death of the East Coast rapper and former Tupac adversary, the Notorious B.I.G., concluded the West-East feud that had riddled hip hop throughout the 1990s. The West Coast scene slowly started to fade from the mainstream in the early 2000s, as <b>fans</b> <b>drifted</b> more towards the East Coast scene, with new artists such as 50 Cent coming to the fore alongside veterans such as Nas and the Wu-Tang Clan. In addition, Southern hip hop reached the mainstream in the early 2000s and, arguably, Atlanta's rap scene became the most popular in the country with the rise of crunk in 2003-2004.|$|R
40|$|International audienceEntry to mine {{workings}} is normally gained {{by means of}} vertical shafts or horizontal or inclined tunnels called adits. Other mining objects such as <b>fan</b> <b>drifts</b> and wheel pits are often associated with mine shafts. Such mining objects {{may or may not}} have been filled, wholly or partially, or otherwise sealed to prevent entry when the mine was abandoned. Nowadays mine entries are usually adequately protected on abandonment to prevent accidental ingress. Many earlier mine entries remain open, however, and may pose a threat to human safety. Within the framework of MISSTER (Mine shafts: improving security and new tools for the evaluation of risks), a European RFCS project (Research Fund for Coal and Steel), a selection of representative cases of mine shafts incidents was reviewed. This work was carried out by INERIS (France), GEOCONTROL (Spain), University of Nottingham and Mine Rescue Service Ltd (United Kingdom), Central Mining Institute and KWSA (Poland). The experience accumulated through this work will allow a fuller determination of risk scenarios associated with mine shafts...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{propeller}} <b>fans</b> in underground <b>drift</b> stone mines {{has shown}} that significant ventilation improvements can be achieved. In large-entry mines {{that do not have}} any high resistance-sections (shafts> 100 ft long or shaft diameters < 12 ft), propeller fans can greatly increase the total system airflow. Propeller fans can be used as either main mine fans or as freestanding auxiliary (jet) fans. NIOSH researchers have documented the performance of two recently installed propeller fans in a working limestone mine (figure 1). Together the fans exhausted 750, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 200. These fans replaced an axial vane main mine fan that produced 300, 000 cfm at a rated hp of 250. The use of the propeller fans more than doubled the air quantity while operating at 50 hp less than the original main mine fan system. In addition, the new fans, when used with effective air-coursing methods such as stoppings, reduced or eliminated recirculation near the face areas. This is because propeller fans are more efficient at lower pressures and can produce large air quantities at lower horsepower requirements than axial vane fans.

40|$|Geological {{evidence}} indicates that sediment reworking is common around the continental margins and abyssal depths of the Norwegian-Greenland Sea, a high-latitude setting with glacier-influenced margins. Detailed analysis of 22 cores up to 5 in long, placed in context by accompanying geophysical data including high resolution sub-bottom profiles, swath bathymetry and backscatter maps, indicates that reworking is variable and ranges from debris flows and turbidity currents, to bottom-current activity, as well as iceberg scouring. Reworking by debris flows appears to be restricted mainly to the main trough-mouth fans and sediment slides. Elsewhere, turbidity-current activity frequently dominates, although iceberg ploughing down to 600 in depth and current winnowing assume increasing significance on continental shelves. Reworking in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea reflects variations in ice-sheet dynamics that, in turn, influence the rate of sediment delivery and location of depocentres. Spatial variations {{in the style of}} reworking may also reflect the influence of continental slope gradient and bedrock geology on continental shelves. The widespread nature of sediment reworking has important implications for palaeoceanographic investigations in the region, as reworking can result in erosion and disturbance of the sediment column. It is estimated that less than 7 % of material delivered to the Norwegian-Greenland Sea since the Late Weichselian is derived from hemipelagic and pelagic sedimentation. This problem is significant where continuous, high-resolution records of hemipelagic and pelagic sedimentation are required, and attempts are made to correlate with other high-resolution proxy records, such as ice cores, at sub-millennial scales. Bioturbation results in the smoothing of high-resolution records and imposes a maximum resolution for sediment-core time-slices of generally 400 years or more. In the Norwegian-Greenland Sea, areas of high sedimentation such as trough-mouth <b>fans</b> or contourite <b>drifts</b> are commonly associated with extensive reworking. Identification of reworking is particularly important where attempts are made to link records of iceberg-rafted debris to past ice-sheet dynamics, as bottom-current winnowing and mass-flow processes can increase the concentration of coarse-grained iceberg-rafted debris. Such localized accentuation of the iceberg-rafted debris signal may lead to erroneous palaeo-environmental interpretations. It is therefore critical that palaeoceanographic interpretations are firmly underpinned by an explicit sedimentological assessment of reworking...|$|R
40|$|The Environmental {{and health}} risks of {{pesticide}} application {{have been the}} subject of research for more than fifty years and still continue to be a great concern. Ground/surface water contamination and bystander exposure from pesticide drift occurring during and after application and health risks of excessive pesticide residues detected on agricultural products are continuously in the spotlight. Orchard spray application received special emphasis due to the relatively large amount of pesticides applied and the complexity of the process involved. Both experimental and modelling approaches have been used in the past to determine pesticide drift for regulatory risk assessment studies. However, the complexity and variability of the drift process and the efforts needed for a proper analysis remain considerable hurdles in development of approaches to mitigate negative impacts of spraying. The main objective of this thesis was, therefore, to contribute to the understanding of spray deposition and drift in orchards by developing a mechanistic drift model of the air assisted spray process using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). An integrated research approach combining experiments and simulations was used throughout the thesis. Spray nozzles and three different air-assisted orchard sprayer designs (a cross-flow sprayer, an axial sprayer and a sprayer with individual spouts) were first characterized under controlled laboratory conditions in terms of their spray liquid distribution and air flow pattern. The results obtained from this indoor trials were used to validate a CFD orchard spray model. The results obtained from both the experiment and the CFD model showed important differences in air flow pattern and liquid distribution generated by the different sprayer designs. It was also seen that the liquid distribution follows the air flow pattern which is strongly influenced by the architecture of the air discharge unit on the sprayers. The CFD model was further used to optimize the outlet design of the sprayer with individual spouts. The measurement and modelling of the spray distribution was done at this stage using a vertical patternator wall rather than the actual trees. An extensive field trial was then performed using the three air assisted orchard sprayers designs and four different training systems of apple and pear to investigate the effect of tree architecture on spray distribution and to check whether the differences in air flow profiles among the three sprayer designs affect the on-target spray distribution. The results obtained showed that total leaf cover, leaf wall porosity and tree volume strongly affected the total on-target deposition. There was a strong relationship between the vertical leaf deposition profile and the air flow pattern from the sprayers. Predicted vertical deposition profiles from a canopy CFD model of spray application in orchards that incorporates the actual tree architecture, were validated against experimental profiles. This CFD model was then used to assess the effect of wind and sprayer design on spray distribution within the four training systems. The analysis performed on the axial sprayer using the CFD model showed that wind blowing in the direction of spraying actually gave the largest deposition on the tree, constraining the spray in the canopy region. A wind direction opposite to the spraying direction, however, resulted in an increase of the ground deposition and the amount of spray remaining in air. Further analysis on the effect of increasing the magnitude of a cross flow wind showed an increase in the off-target spray distribution. The CFD model was further elaborated to predict spray drift from orchard sprayers away from the orchard. This model was validated against drift measurements from an apple orchard with different nozzle arrangements. The model predicted the transient spray profile, calculates the fraction captured by the trees, the airborne spray and the ground deposition up to 40 m from the last tree row in agreement with the measured profiles. This model was then used to evaluate the effect of drift reducing nozzles and <b>fan</b> speed on <b>drift.</b> Drift reducing nozzles reduced the drift distance (the maximum downstream distance droplets travel behind the target canopy), but increased near-tree ground deposition. Further analysis done using different nozzle arrangements showed that the increase in ground deposition near the tree can be avoided (keeping the reduction in the drift distance) by combining the drift reducing nozzles with the standard ones. A reduced sprayer airflow resulted in further reduction of the percentage drift. The analysis showed that the model can be used to analyse different drift mitigation strategies and perform sprayer optimization. Future investigations could focus on developing a database of drift curves that are obtained from in silico experiments performed under different orchard spraying scenarios using the developed model. These drift curves could then be used to develop online drift monitoring tools or combined with recommended drift mitigation scenarios to be used by applicators. status: publishe...|$|R
