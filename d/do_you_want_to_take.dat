According to Nikita Khrushchev, the latter became a source of dispute between the Soviet Union and the Republic of Turkey in the 1950s, when Turkey objected to the {{inclusion}} of Mount Ararat, which holds a deep symbolic importance for Armenians but is located on Turkish territory, in the coat of arms. Turkey felt {{that the presence of}} such an image implied Soviet designs on Turkish territory. Khrushchev retorted by asking, [...] "Why do you have a moon depicted on your flag? After all, the moon doesn't belong to Turkey, not even half the moon... <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over the whole universe?" [...] Turkey dropped the issue after this.|$|E

5000|$|At first, Armenia was not {{impacted}} significantly by {{the policies}} {{set forth by}} Lenin's government. Prior to his debilitating illness, Lenin encouraged the policy of Korenizatsiya or [...] "nativization" [...] in the republics which essentially called for the different nationalities of the Soviet Union to [...] "administer their republics", establishing native-language schools, newspapers, and theaters. In Armenia, the Soviet government ruled that all illiterate citizens up {{to the age of}} fifty to attend school and learn to read Armenian, which became the official language of the republic. The number of Armenian-language newspapers (Sovetakan Hayastan), magazines (Garun), and journals (Sovetakan Grakanutyun, Patma-Banasirakan Handes) grew. An institute for culture and history was created in 1921 in Echmiatsin, the Yerevan Opera Theater and a dramatic theater in Yerevan were built and established in the 1920s and 1930s, the Matenadaran, a facility to house ancient and medieval manuscripts was erected in 1959, important historical studies were prepared by a new cadre of Soviet-trained scholars, and popular works in the fields of art and literature were produced by such luminaries as Martiros Saryan, Avetik Isahakian and Yeghishe Charents, who all adhered to the socialist dictum of creating works [...] "national in form, socialist in content." [...] The first Armenian film studio, Armenkino, released the first fiction film, Namus (Honor) in 1925 and the first sound film Pepo, both directed by Hamo Bek-Nazarov.Like all the other republics of the Soviet Union, Armenia had its own flag and coat of arms.
