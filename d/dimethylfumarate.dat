We now report the inhibitory effect of <b>dimethylfumarate</b> on tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha- or interleukin- 1 alpha -induced intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression in normal human dermal fibroblasts. Western blots of normal human dermal fibroblast cytoplasmic extracts showed that <b>dimethylfumarate</b> has minor effects on the I kappaB alpha, beta and epsilon proteins: their cytokine-induced degradation and resynthesis is only slowed down, an effect most prominently observed for I kappaB beta. No inhibitory effect of <b>dimethylfumarate</b> was observed on cytokine-induced RelA/p 65 or c-Rel accumulation in nuclear extracts of cytokine-treated normal human dermal fibroblast cells. In contrast, cytokine-induced nuclear factor beta B 1 /p 50 nuclear accumulation was specifically inhibited by <b>dimethylfumarate.</b> This inhibitory effect on nuclear factor kappa B 1 nuclear localization in normal human dermal fibroblasts proved sufficient to inhibit nuclear factor kappa B 1 -RelA binding to nuclear factor kappaB consensus oligonucleotides in DNA binding assays. Likewise, cytokine-induced activation of a pNF kappaB::luciferase reporter construct in transiently transfected normal human dermal fibroblasts was inhibited by <b>dimethylfumarate.</b> The observations support a mechanistic model for the oral antipsoriatic <b>dimethylfumarate</b> in which lowering of nuclear factor kappa B 1 leads {{to changes in the}} nuclear factor kappa B 1 -ReLA nuclear balance and inhibition of cytokine-induced adhesion molecule expression in normal human dermal fibroblasts...|$|E

To determine specificity, kinetics, and molecular mechanisms of different fumaric acid esters {{in their ability to}} inhibit endothelial cell activation, we analyzed CD 62 E and CD 54 expression in endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. In lesional skin of psoriatic patients, oral fumaric acid ester treatment resulted in a marked reduction of CD 62 E but not CD 54 expression on dermal microvessels. Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells, <b>dimethylfumarate</b> almost completely inhibited tumor-necrosis-factor-induced CD 62 E, but not CD 54 expression at concentrations ≨ 70 µM, mimicking the situation in vivo. A 60 min <b>dimethylfumarate</b> preincubation was sufficient to block tumor-necrosis-factor-induced CD 62 E expression for up to 24 h. In contrast, equimolar concentrations of methylhydrogenfumarate, the hydrolysis product of <b>dimethylfumarate,</b> did not suppress tumor-necrosis-factor-induced CD 62 E expression. Likewise, all fumaric acid esters other than <b>dimethylfumarate</b> were ineffective. Using CD 62 E, NF-κB, or AP- 1 -responsive promoter constructs, <b>dimethylfumarate</b> inhibited tumor-necrosis-factor-induced activation of the CD 62 E and the NF-κB but not the AP- 1 promoter construct.

40|$|Inflammation and {{oxidative}} stress {{are thought to}} promote tissue damage in multiple sclerosis. Thus, novel therapeutics enhancing cellular resistance to free radicals could prove useful for multiple sclerosis treatment. BG 00012 is an oral formulation of <b>dimethylfumarate.</b> In a phase II multiple sclerosis trial, BG 00012 demonstrated beneficial effects on relapse rate and magnetic resonance imaging markers indicative of inflammation as well as axonal destruction. First we have studied effects of <b>dimethylfumarate</b> on the disease course, central nervous system, tissue integrity and the molecular mechanism of action in an animal model of chronic multiple sclerosis: myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. In the chronic phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, preventive or therapeutic application of <b>dimethylfumarate</b> ameliorated the disease course and improved preservation of myelin, axons and neurons. In vitro, the application of fumarates increased murine neuronal survival and protected human or rodent astrocytes against {{oxidative stress}}. Application of <b>dimethylfumarate</b> led to stabilization of the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -related factor 2, activation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -related factor 2 -dependent transcriptional activity and accumulation of NADP(H) quinoline oxidoreductase- 1 as a prototypical target gene. Furthermore, the immediate metabolite of <b>dimethylfumarate,</b> monomethylfumarate, leads to direct modification of the inhibitor of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -related factor 2, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, at cysteine residue 151. In turn, increased levels of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -related factor 2 and reduced protein nitrosylation were detected in the central nervous sytem of dimethylfumarate-treated mice. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -related factor 2 was also upregulated in the spinal cord of autopsy specimens from untreated patients with multiple sclerosis. In dimethylfumarate-treated mice suffering from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, increased immunoreactivity for nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -related factor 2 was detected by confocal microscopy in neurons of the motor cortex and the brainstem {{as well as in}} oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. In mice deficient for nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -related factor 2 on the same genetic background, the <b>dimethylfumarate</b> mediated beneficial effects on clinical course, axon preservation and astrocyte activation were almost completely abolished thus proving the functional relevance of this transcription factor for the neuroprotective mechanism of action. We conclude that the ability of <b>dimethylfumarate</b> to activate nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -related factor 2 may offer a novel cytoprotective modality that further augments the natural antioxidant responses in multiple sclerosis tissue and is not yet targeted by other multiple sclerosis therapies. © The Author (2011) ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the last}} two years several cases of severe contact {{dermatitis}} related to newly acquired sofas and armchairs originating from China have been published.

Oral fumaric acid esters are an effective therapy for psoriasis and {{are believed to}} exert their effects mainly through their anti-inflammatory properties. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differential effects of <b>dimethylfumarate</b> (BG- 12; FAG- 201) for psoriasis on lesional T-cell subsets, natural killer (NK) T cells, and keratinocyte hyperproliferation and differentiation. STUDY DESIGN: A before-and-after clinical and immunohistochemical study {{as part of a}} larger clinical trial. SETTING: Single outpatient clinic. PATIENTS: Six patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. INTERVENTION: <b>Dimethylfumarate</b> 720 mg daily for 16 weeks. METHODS: Biopsies were taken from the lesional skin of six psoriatic patients, at baseline and after 16 weeks of treatment with <b>dimethylfumarate.</b> Clinical severity scores were obtained (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI] and psoriasis severity SUM scores). T-cell subsets (CD 4 +, CD 8 +, CD 45 RO+, CD 45 RA+, CD 2 +, CD 25 +), cells expressing NK receptors (CD 94, CD 161), an epidermal proliferation marker (Ki 67), and a keratinization marker (K 10) were immunohistochemically stained and, together with 'epidermal thickness,' quantified using image analysis. RESULTS: At week 16, the mean PASI and SUM scores were reduced by 55 % (p < 0. 01) and 49 % (p < 0. 01), respectively. In line with these results, epidermal hyperproliferation, keratinocyte differentiation, and epidermal thickness significantly improved. In the dermis and the epidermis, the relevant T-cell subsets significantly declined. However, in both the lesional psoriatic dermis and epidermis, cells expressing NK receptors (CD 94 and CD 161) persisted after 16 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Dimethylfumarate</b> is an effective therapy for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

40|$|Fumaric {{acid esters}} {{have proved to}} be {{effective}} for the systemic treatment of severe psoriasis vulgaris. These compounds have been shown to induce a Th 2 -like cytokine secretion pattern in T cells and to reduce keratinocyte proliferation in vitro. Dendritic cells seem to be of major importance as regulatory cells driving the psoriatic tissue reaction. Monocytes or CD 34 -positive myeloid progenitor cells are precursors of dendritic cells that can be generated in vitro by culture with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin- 4. Using this model the effect of fumaric acid esters on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/interleukin- 4 -induced differentiation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells was investigated. The results of this study show that <b>dimethylfumarate</b> as well as methylhydrogenfumarate-calcium-salt (0. 01 – 100 [*]μg per[*]ml) concentration-dependently inhibit monocyte-derived dendritic cell differentiation. This was reflected by an inhibition of CD 1 a, CD 40, CD 80, CD 86, and HLA-DR expression as well as by a reduced capacity of dimethylfumarate-treated monocyte-derived dendritic cells to stimulate lymphocytes in the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction. Other fumaric acid esters showed no effect on monocyte-derived dendritic cell-differentiation. At higher concentrations (30 – 100 [*]μg per[*]ml) <b>dimethylfumarate,</b> but not methylhydrogenfumarate calcium-salt induced apoptosis in monocyte-derived dendritic cells as measured by expression of Apo 2. 7 and DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay). These data point to a high susceptibility of the monocyte/dendritic cell system to <b>dimethylfumarate</b> and its main metabolite methylhydrogenfumarate.

We report a patient with recalcitrant DGA who was treated with fumaric acid esters (FAE). Case presentation A 40 -year old Caucasian woman presented with a 25 -year history of recalcitrant DGA. On both legs and the abdomen there were erythematous annular plaques. She was treated with FAE in tablet form using two formulations differing in strength (low strength tablets: 30 mg <b>dimethylfumarate,</b> 67 mg monoethylfumarate Ca salt, 5 mg monoethylfumarate Mg salt, 3 mg monoethylfumarate Zn salt; high strength tablets: 120 mg <b>dimethylfumarate,</b> 87 mg monoethylfumarate Ca salt, 5 mg monoethylfumarate Mg salt, 3 mg monoethylfumarate Zn salt). After three-month therapy, an almost complete clearance of skin lesions was achieved. With the exception of temporary lymphopenia, no adverse effects were observed. The patient remained in remission during a six-month follow up period.

30|$|The {{accumulation}} of D- 2 -HG, succinate, and fumarate all lead to impaired activity {{of a class}} of enzymes called α-KG-dependent dioxygenases. These oxygenases include prolyl hydroxylase (PHD), which causes HIF 1 α degradation [88]. Hence, the {{accumulation of}} D- 2 -HG, succinate, and fumarate causes HIF 1 α accumulation. Other α-KG-dependent dioxygenases include the JMJD family KDMs and the TET family of 5 mC hydroxylases, which impact epigenetic events [89]. Ultimately, by impacting cellular processes such as hypoxia response and epigenetic modifications, D- 2 -HG, succinate, and fumarate promote tumorigenesis. Such metabolites whose abnormal accumulation causes both metabolic and nonmetabolic dysregulation and promotes tumorigenesis are often called oncometabolites. However, there is only limited evidence linking these oncometabolites to metastatic progression. For example, treatment with <b>dimethylfumarate,</b> a cell-permeable form of fumarate, strongly reduces invasion and metastasis formation in melanoma [90 – 92], although overexpression of FH in a FH-deficient renal cell carcinoma line inhibits cellular migration and invasion [93].|$|E

40|$|Background: Head {{and neck}} {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an aggressive and recurrent malignancy owing to intrinsic radioresistance and lack of induction of apoptosis. The major focus of this work was to design a transient glutathione depleting strategy {{during the course of}} irradiation of HNSCC in order to overcome their radioresistance associated with redox adaptation. Methodology/Principal Findings: Treatment of SQ 20 B cells with <b>dimethylfumarate</b> (DMF), a GSH-depleting agent, and L-Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis 4 h before a 10 Gy irradiation led to the lowering of the endogenous GSH content to less than 10 % of that in control cells and to the triggering of radiation-induced apoptotic cell death. The sequence of biochemical events after GSH depletion and irradiation included ASK- 1 followed by JNK activation which resulted in the triggering of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through Bax translocation to mitochondria.

Inflammation and oxidative stress are also thought to promote tissue damage in multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent data point at an important role of anti-oxidative pathways for tissue protection in chronic-progressive MS, particularly involving the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -related factor 2 (Nrf 2).

No change was observed for CD 54, VLA- 4, and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand- 1. An enhancement of CD 69 expression was noted (22 %). DMF led to a significant reduction in binding of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to E-selectin (72 %), P-selectin (36 %), and vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (33 %) in vitro. Intravital microscopy of PBMCs in ear vasculature of wild-type and knockout mice showed that rolling was mainly P-selectin-dependent and could be reduced by 61 % through DMF incubation. We provide early evidence that DMF affects adhesion molecule expression on human leukocytes and their rolling behavior in vivo, indicating that DMF directly affects the initial step of leukocyte extravasation...|$|E
40|$|The {{fumaric acid}} esters (FAEs) {{have been used}} for the oral {{treatment}} of psoriasis for some 50 years. Given that a persistent and maintained angiogenesis is associated with several cutaneous diseases, including psoriasis, we sought in our study to gain further insight into their mechanism of action by investigating whether FAEs are able to interfere with angiogenesis mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that <b>dimethylfumarate</b> (DMF) inhibits certain functions of endothelial cells, namely, differentiation, proliferation, and migration. This activity was not exhibited by similar concentrations of monomethylfumarate or fumaric acid. Our data indicate that DMF inhibits the growth of transformed and nontransformed cells in a dose-dependent manner. The growth-inhibitory effect exerted by this compound on proliferating endothelial cells could be due, at least in part, to an induction of apoptosis. Inhibition by DMF of the mentioned essential steps of in vitro angiogenesis is consistent with the observed inhibition of in vivo angiogenesis, substantiated using chick chorioallantoic membrane and live fluorescent zebrafish embryo neovascularization assays. The antiangiogenic activity of DMF may contribute to the antipsoriatic, antitumoral, and antimetastatic activities of this compound and suggests its potential in the treatment of angiogenesis-related malignancies...|$|E
40|$|A {{mixture of}} {{different}} fumaric acid esters (FAE) is established for systemic therapy of psoriasis, a frequent inflammatory skin disease. The main active compound of FAE, however, {{has not been}} identified so far, and the mechanisms of activity are only partially understood. We analyzed the impact of FAE on in vitro immune function and aimed to gain knowledge about the mode of action. <b>Dimethylfumarate</b> (DMF) and diethylfumarate (DEF), but not fumaric acid, methylhydrogenfumarate and ethylhydrogenfumarate, exhibited potent depression of inflammatory cytokine secretion (e. g., tumor necrosis factorα, IL- 12, and IFNγ) in activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Moreover, solely DMF and DEF inhibited alloreactive T-cell proliferation in mixed leukocyte reaction. Interestingly, these immunosuppressive effects were accompanied by the strong induction of the anti-inflammatory stress protein heme oxygenase 1 (HO- 1). Supplementation with exogenous glutathione (GSH), which is known to bind DMF, prevented both HO- 1 induction {{as well as the}} anti-inflammatory effects of DMF. Moreover, inhibition of HO- 1 activity restored the diminished IL- 12 and IFNγ production after FAE treatment. These results suggest that DMF acts as active compound within the FAE mixture and at least partially mediates its immunomodulatory activity by the induction of the anti-inflammatory stress protein HO- 1 ascribed to the functional depletion of reduced GSH...|$|E
40|$|Psoriasis and {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) are chronic inflammatory diseases sharing similar pathogenic pathways. Intestinal microbial changes such as {{a decrease}} of bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{have been reported in}} IBD, suggesting the presence of a gut-skin axis. To investigate whether the S. cerevisiae abundance was altered in psoriasis patients versus healthy controls, and whether <b>dimethylfumarate</b> (DMF) interacted with this yeast. Using qPCR, faecal samples were compared between psoriasis patients without DMF (n = 30), psoriasis patients with DMF (n = 28), and healthy controls (n = 32). Faecal S. cerevisiae abundance was decreased in psoriasis compared to healthy controls (p< 0. 001). Interestingly, DMF use raised S. cerevisiae levels (p< 0. 001). Gastrointestinal adverse-effects of DMF were correlated with a higher S. cerevisiae abundance (p = 0. 010). In vitro, a direct effect of DMF on S. cerevisiae growth was observed. In addition, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies were not elevated in psoriasis. The abundance of baker's yeast S. cerevisiae is decreased in psoriasis patients, but appears to be restored upon DMF use. S. cerevisiae is generally classified as a yeast with beneficial immunomodulatory properties, but may also be involved in the occurrence of DMF's gastrointestinal adverse-effects. Potentially, DMF might be a new therapy for IBD...|$|E
40|$|Host {{defense against}} {{pathogens}} relies on neutrophil activation. Inadequate neutrophil activation is {{often associated with}} chronic inflammatory diseases. Neutrophils also constitute a significant portion of infiltrating cells in chronic inflammatory diseases, for example, psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. Fumarates improve the latter diseases, which so far has been attributed to the effects on lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Here, we focused on the effects of <b>dimethylfumarate</b> (DMF) on neutrophils. In vitro, DMF inhibited neutrophil activation, including changes in surface marker expression, reactive oxygen species production, formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, and migration. Phagocytic ability and autoantibody-induced, neutrophil-dependent tissue injury ex vivo was also impaired by DMF. Regarding the mode of action, DMF modulates—in a stimulus-dependent manner-neutrophil activation using the phosphoinositide 3 -kinase/Akt-p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 pathways. For in vivo validation, mouse models of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, an organ-specific autoimmune disease caused by autoantibodies to type VII collagen, were employed. In the presence of DMF, blistering induced by injection of anti-type VII collagen antibodies into mice was significantly impaired. DMF treatment of mice with clinically already-manifested epidermolysis bullosa acquisita led to disease improvement. Collectively, we demonstrate a profound inhibitory activity of DMF on neutrophil functions. These findings encourage wider use of DMF in patients with neutrophil-mediated diseases...|$|E

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, which results from the deregulated interaction of inflammatory cells and tissue forming cells. Beside the derangement of the epithelial cell layer, the most prominent tissue pathology of the asthmatic lung is the hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the airway smooth muscle cell (ASMC) bundles, which actively contributes to airway inflammation and remodeling. ASMCs of asthma patients secrete proinflammatory chemokines CXCL 10, CCL 11, and RANTES which attract immune cells into the airways and may thereby initiate inflammation. None of the available asthma drugs cures the disease—only symptoms are controlled. <b>Dimethylfumarate</b> (DMF) is used as an anti-inflammatory drug in psoriasis and showed promising results in phase III clinical studies in multiple sclerosis patients. In regard to asthma therapy, DMF has been anecdotally reported to reduce asthma symptoms in patients with psoriasis and asthma. Here we discuss the potential use of DMF as a novel therapy in asthma {{on the basis of}} in vitro studies of its inhibitory effect on ASMC proliferation and cytokine secretion in ASMCs. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} two years, Europe has {{experienced}} a rise in skin allery and dermatitis due to goods and Asian provenance that have been treacted with <b>dimethylfumarate</b> (DMFU). Accordingly,laboratories in the leather and foodwear sectors have been obliged to develop analytical methods to determine {{the presence of this}} substance given de absence of an official method. The ban on DMFU as laid down in Decision 2009 / 251 of the European Union establishes a maximun concentration of DMFU in products of 0. 1 mg/Kg. A simple nom-destructive rapid method based on manual headspace solid-phase micro extraction (HS-SPME) and gas cromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is proposed to detect DMFU in leather and footwear. Thereafter, the samples which DMFU is detected are analysed by solid-liquid extraction (SLE) with acetone after which DMFU is quantitatively determined by GC-MS. The quantitative method in validated in terms of linearity, precision, sensivity and recovery; demostrating its reliability. Quantification of this performed used naphthalene-D 8 as internal standard. The detection limits are 0. 005 mg/Kg and 0. 03 mg/Kg for the HS-SPME-GC-MS and SLE-GC-MS methods, respectively. Given that these limits are bellow the maximun limit of 0. 1 mg/Kg imposed by the European Union, the proposed methods are suitable for determining DMFU content in real samples.

40|$|The {{association}} between angiogenesis and chronic inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis, {{seems to be}} an important phenomenon implicated in the pathogenesis of these medical conditions. Recent studies provide evidence that <b>dimethylfumarate</b> (DMF) has a profound anti-inflammatory as well as anti-tumorigenic action, although the effect of DMF on angiogenesis is unknown. Signaling via the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 2 (VEGFR 2) pathway is critical for angiogenic responses. Therefore, we explored whether the known anti-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic properties of DMF might be mediated in part by anti-angiogenic effects through the reduction in VEGFR 2 expression. In this study, DMF was found to inhibit endothelial VEGFR 2 expression; time- and concentration-dependent inhibition was demonstrated both at the level of protein and mRNA expression. This blockade was coincident with the inhibition of the formation of capillary-like structures. The DMF-dependent inhibition of VEGFR 2 transcription was found to be mediated by an element located between base pairs - 60 and - 37, which contains two adjacent, consensus Sp 1 transcription factor-binding sites, and the constitutive formation of complexes containing Sp 1 at this site is decreased by DMF treatment. Inhibition of VEGFR- 2 is shown to be one critical aspect in DMF-mediated anti-angiogenic effects...|$|E
40|$|Rhinovirus-(RV-) induced asthma {{exacerbations}} {{account for}} high asthma-related health costs and morbidity in Australia. The cellular mechanism underlying this pathology is likely {{the result of}} RV-induced nuclear-factor-kappa-B-(NF-κB-) dependent inflammation. NF-κB may also be important in RV replication as inhibition of NF-κB inhibits replication of other viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and cytomegalovirus. To establish the role of NF-κB inhibitors in RV-induced IL- 6 and IL- 8 and RV replication, we used pharmacological inhibitors of NF-κB, and steroids and/or β 2 agonists were used for comparison. Primary human lung fibroblasts were infected with RV- 16 {{in the presence of}} NF-κB inhibitors: BAY- 117085 and dimethyl fumarate; β 2 agonist: salmeterol; and/or corticosteroids: dexamethasone; fluticasone. RV-induced IL- 6 and IL- 8 and RV replication were assessed using ELISAs and virus titration assays. RV replicated and increased IL- 6 and IL- 8 release. Salmeterol increased, while dexamethasone and fluticasone decreased RV-induced IL- 6 and IL- 8 (P< 0. 05). The NF-κB inhibitor BAY- 117085 inhibited only RV-induced IL- 6 (P< 0. 05) and dimethyl fumarate did not alter RV-induced IL- 6 and IL- 8. <b>Dimethylfumarate</b> increased RV replication whilst other drugs did not alter RV replication. These data suggest that inhibition of NF-κB alone is unlikely to be an effective treatment compared to current asthma therapeutics...|$|E
