50|$|The Times reviewer, Michael Billington, was not impressed: Inspired by Jules Verne", {{the credits}} for this film rather cryptically announce. One cant {{argue with the}} credits, of course; but a more {{instantly}} recognizable inspiration is that brand of screen comedy that assumes that a large gathering of well-known names plus some vintage piece of machinery (a car for preference, but a plane or rocket will do) adds up to irresistible mirth. But, as this film takes nearly two hours to demonstrate, its no use cramming the cast with comedy actors <b>if</b> <b>youre</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give them anything very funny to do.|$|R
5000|$|I {{was told}} that at Disney the actor was told to play it like a cartoon with all that exaggeration. In Lord of the Rings, I had the actors play it straight. The {{rotoscope}} {{in the past has}} been used in scenes and then exaggerated. The action becomes cartoony. The question then comes up that <b>if</b> <b>youre</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be cartoony, why animate? ...It is the traditional method of rotoscoping but the approach is untraditional. Its a rotoscope realism unlike anything thats been seen. It really is a unique thing for animation. The number of characters moving in a scene is staggering. In The Lord of the Rings, you have hundreds of people in the scene. We have cels with a thousand people on them. It was so complex sometimes wed only get one cel a week from an artist. It turned out that the simple shots were the ones that only had four people in them. Ralph Bakshi ...|$|R
5000|$|This open {{promotion}} of certain viewpoints resulted in criticism from journalism professors and other newspaper editors, who worried that negative news about {{topics such as}} the military and business might not be covered.

Wheres the cheerleading there?" [...] {{a reference to the}} Union-Tribunes Pulitzer Prize winning coverage of the Duke Cunningham bribery scandal.

Do you remember your Crofts scholarship at Newnham? Well, that was founded by my brother the M.P.

When Moon Mullins creator Frank Willard taught briefly there, Willard invited the talented youngster to visit his workplace, The Chicago Tribune.

He finally turned around and said, Ferd, <b>if</b> <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hang around here all this time, Im going to put you to work. So I got a job as assistant at 15 bucks a week.

60|$|GUNN [interrupting him] I {{know what}} <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say, Count. <b>Youre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{say that the}} whole thing seems to you to be quite new and unusual and original. The naval {{lieutenant}} is a Frenchman who cracks up the English and runs down the French: the hackneyed old Shaw touch. The characters are second-rate middle class, instead of being dukes and millionaires. The heroine gets kicked through the mud: real mud. Theres no plot. All the old stage conventions and puppets without the old ingenuity and the old enjoyment. And a feeble air of intellectual pretentiousness kept up all through to persuade you that if the author hasnt written a good play it's because hes too clever to stoop to anything so commonplace. And you three experienced men have sat through all this, and cant tell me who wrote it! Why, the play bears the author's signature in every line.|$|R

5000|$|The band also {{revealed}} that within their concept album trilogy, Holy Wood serves as prequel to Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar despite the latter two preceding Holy Wood in release date. Each album contains its own distinct storyline, which can be linked {{together to create a}} larger overarching storyline encompassing all three. Manson has offered this {{much in the way of}} an interpretation: [...] "Wood is about wanting to fit into a world that didnt want me, and fighting really hard to get there. albums deepest elements are idealism and the desire to start a revolution. If you begin with Holy Wood, then Mechanical Animals really talks about how that revolution gets taken away from you and turned into a product, and then Antichrist Superstar is where youre given a choice to decide <b>if</b> <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be controlled by the power that you created or if you want to destroy yourself and then start over.

5000|$|After {{the episode}} aired, Parker and Stone {{received}} feedback that audiences felt [...] "Starvin Marvin" [...] was especially unkind to Struthers. Although {{they did not}} speak to her themselves, the duo received word that Struthers was {{a fan of the}} show until [...] "Starvin Marvin" [...] aired, after which she was very upset and reportedly reacted emotionally over her portrayal. Struthers was particularly saddened by the fact that her character steals food from the same starving children she had been working to help. Parker and Stone were slightly remorseful when they learned of her reaction and have said they did not have anything against Struthers personally. Nevertheless, Struthers was portrayed in an even less flattering way in the third season episode [...] "Starvin Marvin in Space" [...] as a Jabba the Hutt-like creature. In a DVD commentary track, Parker said of Struthers, [...] "Dude, youre really setting yourself up <b>if</b> <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be that fat and go on the air talking about children. ... We dont think shes a bad person, shes probably nice to try to do this, but cut down on the Twinkies a little bit before going on the air." ...|$|E
40|$|FORWARD: Message from Editorial Staff and Designer, Jocelyn Kornfeld Nearly 100 submissions. That???s {{what the}} {{editorial}} {{staff of the}} Island Fox had to choose from to create this year???s journal. When {{we looked at the}} pieces collectively we realized that each of them deals, in some way with discovery whether it???s self-discovery learning to cope with death, love, and depression, dealing with family, or becoming politically active. Each of us, as college students and human beings, can relate to all of these issues. Our hope is that as you read the Island Fox, you find something you can connect with. The chosen pieces were submitted to our graphic designer, Jocelyn Kornfeld, who was given free range with design and layout. How you see things on the pages is all hers ??? she is the creative genius behind the scenes. The only caveat was that she keep the format of everything the same way it was when the pieces were originally submitted. Her task was tough: she had to see how the pieces were interconnected. The end result is this Island Fox, and we believe that it represents this year???s submissions well. page 5 Whether or not you have pieces in this year???s journal, <b>if</b> <b>you???re</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be here next year, make sure you submit! It???s a diffcult task to narrow down the submissions into something that will fit into just over a hundred pages. Creativity comes in all shapes and colors, so next year???s journal maybe the perfect fit for your work. And no mater what, whether you submit or not, keep on writing. Do what you love. Make it a good one, The 2008 Island Fox Staf...|$|E
