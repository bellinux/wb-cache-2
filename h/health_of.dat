40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{factors that}} affect awareness <b>of</b> <b>health</b> implications <b>of</b> agrochemical use {{and its effects on}} maize production in Ejura-Sekyedumase Municipality of Ashanti Region, Ghana. One hundred and fifty-four (154) maize farmers were randomly sampled from the municipality. The study used awareness indicators to estimate an index representing farmers’ awareness levels <b>of</b> <b>health</b> implications <b>of</b> agrochemical use. An ordered logit compliment with multivariate linear regression model was used to identify the drivers of farmers’ awareness level <b>of</b> <b>health</b> implications <b>of</b> agrochemical use. Also, a multivariate linear regression model was used to analyze the effects <b>of</b> <b>health</b> implications <b>of</b> agrochemical use on maize output. On average, the respondents have the moderate awareness level <b>of</b> <b>health</b> implications <b>of</b> agrochemical use (0. 578). The awareness level was significantly explained by education, the number of children in school, ownership of TV/radio, experience in agrochemicals use, and farm size. The multivariate linear regression results showed that awareness levels <b>of</b> <b>health</b> implications <b>of</b> agrochemical use increase maize output. It is therefore recommended that interventions aimed at increasing farmers’ awareness levels <b>of</b> <b>health</b> implications <b>of</b> agrochemicals use should focus on educating farmers through interactive radio discussion and training sessions on the field and incorporate safety use of agrochemical in our educational curriculum...|$|R

We examined the self-esteem, internal <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control, and external <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control through sociodemographic and neurocognitive factors. Methods: Forty-six schizophrenic patients and 31 healthy residents from the community or hospital were recruited as the control group. All subjects participated in the self-esteem questionnaire, <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control questionnaire, {{and a series of}} neuropychological measures. Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that inhibition of attention and external <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control were predictors for self-esteem (r=− 0. 30, P< 0. 05; r= 0. 41, P< 0. 01); inhibition of attention and external <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control were contributors for internal <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control (r=− 0. 43, P< 0. 01; r= 0. 61, P< 0. 001); and education was related to external <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control (r=− 0. 31, P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The current study integrated background characteristics and cognitive function to better understand the impact <b>of</b> self-esteem and <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control in schizophrenia. The findings indicated that inhibition <b>of</b> attention, external <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control, and education contributed to self-esteem, internal <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control and external <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control. However, the overall predicted variance accounted for by these predictors was small; thus, further research is necessary to examine imperative variables related with self-esteem and <b>health</b> locus <b>of</b> control in schizophrenia.
