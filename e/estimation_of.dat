Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker base than water, so the amide behaves as a strong base in this medium. It then can be titrated using a solution in glacial acetic acid of a very strong acid, such as perchloric acid.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} an interesting {{feature of the}} Generalized Least Absolute Deviations (GLAD) method for Seemingly Unrelated Regression Equations (SURE) models. Contrary {{to the collapse of}} Generalized Least Squares (GLS) parameter <b>estimations</b> <b>of</b> SURE models to the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) <b>estimations</b> <b>of</b> the individual equations when the same regressors are common between all equations, the <b>estimations</b> <b>of</b> the proposed methodology are not identical to the Least Absolute Deviations (LAD) <b>estimations</b> <b>of</b> the individual equations. This is important since contrary to the least squares methods, one can take advantage of efficiency gain due to cross-equation correlations even if the system includes the same regressors in each equation. This kind of methodology is useful say when estimating the factors that affect firms’ innovation investments across European countries.
