5|$|In February 2011, Dugan {{demonstrated}} an automixer card, marketed by Yamaha, to plug into the accessory slot of a Yamaha <b>digital</b> <b>mixer</b> {{such as the}} O1V96, LS9, M7CL or PM5D. This card, the Dugan-MY16, could mix up to 16 channels of microphone inputs, assigned to selected inserts in the mixer's graphic user interface. Like the Model E-1, the automixer could be adjusted through a web browser interface, allowing remote control with an iPad, touchscreen computer or laptop over wireless network. The Dugan algorithm moved inside Yamaha's QL-eeries of mixers in March 2014, as an option on the graphic equalizer processing page. This internal version could mix 8 or 16 microphones.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2001, {{with the}} release of Reason V1, Propellerhead upped the ante in {{providing}} a £300 software-based electronic music studio, comprising a 14-input automated <b>digital</b> <b>mixer,</b> 99-note polyphonic 'analogue' synth, classic Roland-style drum machine, sample-playback unit, analogue-style step sequencer, loop player, multitrack sequencer, eight effects processors, and over 500MB of synthesizer patches and samples. With this release Propellerhead were credited with [...] "creating a buzz that only happens when a product has really tapped into the zeitgeist, and may just be the one that many [...] waiting for." [...] Reason has since achieved popular appeal and is as of 2016 at version 9.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1982 when the Compact Disc was being introduced, Blyth {{researched}} {{the possibilities of}} creating a digital mixing console. He told Billboard magazine that Soundcraft would not be [...] "leaping into digital {{in the way that}} Neve has done. I think they have gone too far, too quickly.... We are looking at the digital control of analog functions as the first step in that direction." [...] Picking up the pace in the 2000s, Blyth, together with Product Manager Andy Brown, created the Soundcraft Vi6, a <b>digital</b> <b>mixer</b> intended for sound reinforcement applications, released mid-2006. Its interface was a development of Vistonics, a broadcast and studio mixing concept from Harman-owned Studer combined with a digital effects package from Lexicon. Regarding digital audio equipment, Blyth is of the opinion that [...] "companies that take great care over their analog stages, use the best internal digital format and write the best DSP code end up with the best sounding product." [...] He said that he has [...] "strong views on the whole subject of digital consoles, which could fill an article with mostly purple prose", but he notes that [...] "best-in-class analog product these days is truly excellent, but so is digital." [...] Blyth continues today as technical director at Soundcraft Studer's design offices at Potters Bar, [...] north of London.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>digital</b> <b>mixers</b> use {{technology}} to reduce physical space requirements, entailing compromises in user interface {{such as a}} single shared channel adjustment area that is selectable for only one channel at a time. Additionally, most <b>digital</b> <b>mixers</b> have virtual pages or layers that change fader banks into separate controls for additional inputs or for adjusting equalization or aux send levels. This layering can be confusing for some operators. Analog consoles make for simpler understanding of hardware routing. Many <b>digital</b> <b>mixers</b> allow internal reassignment of inputs so that convenient groupings of inputs appear near {{each other at the}} fader bank, a feature that can be disorienting for persons having to make a hardware patch change.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>digital</b> <b>mixers</b> allow {{multiple}} {{effects to}} be inserted virtually, still others allow multiple third party plugins {{to be used}} as virtual inserts.|$|R

50|$|Every analog {{to digital}} {{conversion}} and {{digital to analog}} conversion within a <b>digital</b> <b>mixer</b> entails propagation delay.

50|$|Digital {{mixing console}} sales have {{increased}} dramatically since their introduction in the 1990s. Yamaha {{sold more than}} 1000 PM5D mixers by July, 2005, and other manufacturers are seeing increasing sales of their <b>digital</b> products. <b>Digital</b> <b>mixers</b> are more versatile than analog ones and offer many new features, such as reconfigure signal routing {{at the touch of}} a button. In addition, digital consoles often include processing capabilities such as compression, gating, reverb, automatic feedback suppression and delay. Some products are expandable via third-party software features (called plugins) that add further reverb, compression, delay and tone-shaping tools. Several <b>digital</b> <b>mixers</b> include spectrograph and real time analyzer functions. A few incorporate loudspeaker management tools such as crossover filtering and limiting. Digital signal processing can perform automatic mixing for some simple applications, such as courtrooms, conferences and panel discussions. Consoles with motorized faders can read and write console automation.|$|R
50|$|Voice Systems was {{the first}} of the {{aforementioned}} brands to be created, in 2000, and sells products for the low-end market, specifically: small live gigs, light sound reinforcement systems for speeches or small venues. Under this brand many unique products were or are sold: tiny mixers, such as Micropad, quarter-rack reverb units, 8-channel <b>digital</b> <b>mixers,</b> compact all-in-one systems (e.g. Factotum).|$|R
50|$|Within a <b>digital</b> <b>mixer</b> {{there can}} be differing amounts of latency, {{depending}} on the routing and on how much DSP is in use. Assigning a signal to two parallel paths with significantly different processing on each path can result in extreme comb filtering when recombined. Some digital mixers incorporate internal methods of latency correction so that such problems are avoided.|$|E
50|$|Lexicon was {{a pioneer}} in the hard disk {{recording}} market, introducing the Opus system in 1988. This system feature 8 channels of disk I/O along with an integrated 12 channel <b>digital</b> <b>mixer.</b> In the following years, Opus was upgraded with EQ and console automation. In the mid 1990s Lexicon Studio and Core2 audio interfaces were introduced. They were notable in that they could be expanded with a Lexicon reverb daughterboard that was then accessible to the recording software.|$|E
