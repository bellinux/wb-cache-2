40|$|The marine sub-tropic {{climate of}} Hawaii is {{particularly}} {{suited to the}} use of semi-contained hydraulic lysimeters. Field experiences in the use of these lysimeters reveal a number of problems among which were factors related to the unusual tropical crops of pineapple and sugarcane. This project investigated the modification of the lysimeters to minimize some of these problems. Modular planting schemes in 1. 52 meter rows or beds and tillage depths of 0. 3 to 0. 6 meters dictated minimal lysimeter size. The great height and lodging of the cane required a large lysimeter area to help in the definition of the effective transpiring area. Polyester resin fiberglass reinforced tanks, 3 x 3 x 1. 52 m deep with paper honeycomb strengthened bottoms were designed to meet the need for a large and relatively deep container of minimal weight. The prevalence of high relative humidities necessitated the use of engineering graph paper to reduce distortion of recording traces from shrinkage and swelling of the paper. Despite the limited diurnal and annual temperature variations, careful insulation of the exposed portions of the manometer was necessary. The regular diurnal changes in wind velocity imposed fluctuations on the open-end manometer used for recording the pressure changes in the hydraulic load cells that were offset by venting near ground level. Nylon reinforced butyl rubber <b>irrigation</b> <b>hose</b> with the ends clamped was used to form the bolsters for the load cells. A silicone rubber sealant was used to ensure water tight fittings with standard copper tubing connectors to the bolsters. Stability against rolling was achieved by placing some of the bolsters at right angles to the others. Large tensiometers of perforated polyvinyl pipe covered with porous Porvic membrane were designed to induce suction {{at the base of the}} soil column. The water release curves for the Latosols suggested a 0. 1 bar suction for an approximation of field capacity. U. S.

50|$|The {{homes were}} bulldozed after the {{withdrawal}} on August 14, {{leaving only the}} greenhouses, which {{were part of a}} transaction in which private American citizens bought them for the Palestinians. The donors spent $14 million on the purchase. Former World Bank President James Wolfensohn put up $500,000 of his own cash. Despite the presence of Palestinian security guards, dozens of greenhouses were looted by Palestinians, who emptied them of <b>irrigation</b> <b>hoses,</b> water pumps and plastic sheeting.|$|R

40|$|International audienceFor better {{benefits}} and yields, a good {{estimation of the}} quantity of grapes in a vineyard is necessary. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3 D) imagery technique using conventional 24 GHz frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar is applied for detecting and remotely estimating the intra-parcel quantity of grapes. An estimation is possible even {{in the presence of}} natural or artificial clutters such as leaves, wood, or <b>irrigation</b> <b>hoses.</b> The microwave sensing is performed from the radar beam scanning of a vineyard, and an estimator is defined to derive the quantity of grapes in grapevines from the radar echoes distribution in the interrogated 3 D scene. An algorithm based on contour detection is applied to the 3 D radar image and a new parameter, called the spread factor, is defined for classifying the echo levels of grapes. The quantity of grapes is finally deduced from an appropriate estimator. This remote sensing approach brings a new and flexible solution for precision viticulture by estimating the grape quantity even for grapes hidden by leaves...|$|R
40|$|In ItalyProcessing tomato is {{the first}} Italian {{vegetable}} crop for harvested area (about 94000 ha). A three year “on-farm” open field research on processing tomato was carried out from 2006 to 2008 in a conventional farm in the Serchio Valley (Pisa, Central Italy), {{with the aim of}} testing innovative strategies for non-chemical weed control. The innovative strategy was compared with the farm conventional technique (consisting in chemical treatments and rotary inter-row hoeing interventions). The innovative strategy was carried out by means of the stale-seedbed technique (consisting in a rolling harrowing and flaming treatments) and post-transplanting precision hoeing interventions (with innovative hoes equipped with rigid or rotating tools). All the operative machines were on purpose adapted or modified according to tomato space arrangement. The rolling harrow was equipped with spike disks (placed in the front) and cage rolls (placed at the rear), connected by an overdrive with a ratio equal to 2. The flaming machine was equipped with three 50 cm wide rod burners, for a total working width of 1, 5 m. The precision hoe was equipped with rigid elements for inter-row cultivation, elastic elements for in-row selective weed control and a precision guidance system. With this machine it was possible to till soil and control weeds even inside the crop pairs, without removing the drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>hoses.</b> Furthermore, “V” shaped elements, that allow to “open” crop vegetation during late hoeing interventions, were appositely built. The operative machines performances, weed density during the crop cycle, dry weed biomass at harvest and crop fresh yield were recorded. The innovative strategy allowed to reach significantly higher yield values, an efficient weed control and a relevant increase of gross marketable production with respect to conventional management in all the three years of experiment...|$|R
40|$|During the {{cultivation}} of crops, irrigation is included in necessary working operations like tillage, fertilization and sowing. For irrigation, we require the highest quality of work. Therefore, in this contribution, we focused on monitoring the quality of work of a <b>hose</b> reel <b>irrigation</b> machine. For determining the longitudinal uniformity of winding a hose on a reel, {{the development of a}} digital device was necessary. During the development, we had to design its two basic parts – the hardware and software. After construction of the device, its function was tested directly in working conditions of the particular reel <b>hose</b> <b>irrigation</b> machine. The results of our developed device were compared with the results of the Ecostar 4000 (Bauer, Austria) microcomputer, both with the same hose winding speed. On the microcomputer, we set the hose winding speed to + 2. 1 m*h- 1. The average measured value of speed using the first device Speedmeter SM 1 (2000, KSVS) was 11. 7 m*h- 1. The difference between the set and measured speed was 0. 4 m*h- 1 (absolute error of measurement, the relative error of measurement was 3. 42 %). In the second case, the measurement was performed using a more modern device – Speedmeter SM 2, which allows saving of results into its internal memory (2012, KSVS). The average measured value of winding speed was 12. 26 m*h- 1, which represents the relative error of measurement 2. 77 % compared to the set value of 12. 6 m*h- 1. Based on the results obtained, we recommend the maintenance of the irrigation machine...|$|R
