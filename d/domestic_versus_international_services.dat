40|$|A model {{focusing}} {{on the role of}} the individual in national and corporate culture clash situations, during post-merger integration, is presented. The theory of psychological contract is adapted to explain different individual expectations in <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> mergers and acquisitions (M&As). It is proposed that expectations on the part of both parties to the merger can act to moderate the effects of culture clash in M&As on acquired management attitudes and behavior, and thereby influence post-merger turnover and integration success. Thus, the model explains the inconsistencies of empirical findings about the different effects of national versus corporate cultural differences on M&A performance.

30|$|Moreover, crucial {{differences}} {{between our two}} case study countries are observed {{with respect to the}} importance of <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> C&T-trade. Overall, for Italy domestic C&T-trade of directly embodied C&T-value added was by far more important in both years than for Portugal. Apart from one exception—intermediate demand outflows—Portugal was much more dependent on the international market. For directly embodied C&T-labor a different scenario prevailed: The domestic market relative to the international market played a much more significant role for Portuguese inflows and also for intermediate demand outflows. With respect to C&T-labor directly embodied in final demand C&T-outflows it was, however, again Italy, which was less open to the international market. As regards intertemporal changes, we observe that overall the importance of the domestic market relative to the international market in terms of C&T-value added and C&T-labor directly embodied in C&T-trade flows increased for C&T-outflows and decreased for C&T-inflows for both countries which gives a first hint that outsourcing activities took place. To sum up, our findings also indicate that the relative importance of the <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> the <b>international</b> market for directly embodied C&T-value added and C&T-labor could be a source of different degrees of vulnerability to the restructuring of C&T-trade in the two case study countries.|$|R

The {{evolution of the}} policies can be assessed by the unique domestic and international environment that existed during the most pivotal parts of India's economic history. This research explores {{some of the most}} notable parts of India's political economy and analyzes the domestic and international factors during that time. The research concludes that India's political economy is undoubtedly influenced by both types of factors. More surprisingly, the relative weight of <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> factors has been gradually shifting in the past six decades.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} motivations of {{visitors}} undertaking a volcano tour at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. The study identifies push and pull motives for visiting a non-erupting active volcano; tests {{the influence of}} age, gender and prior experience of volcanic tourism on visitors; and examines differences in motivations for <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> visitors. A total of 174 survey responses were collected and analysed. The results reveal four push motives, namely escape and relaxation, novelty-seeking, volcano knowledge-seeking and socialisation, and two pull motives, namely disaster and cultural heritage-induced and volcanic and geological attribute-driven. Novelty-seeking was found as the strongest motive for visiting volcanic sites. Domestic visitors display higher escape and relaxation and socialisation motives compared to international visitors. The findings provide implications for developing and marketing volcanobased geotourism and for diversifying the Philippines’ tourism products. This study makes a valuable contribution to the under-researched understanding of geotourism at volcanic sites...|$|R

Because of strong correlations with repurchase intention and positive word of mouth, customer delight is a quintessentially germane topic of inquiry. This study illustrates that determinants of customer delight in tourism venues can be identified through travel blog analysis. Using the hotel sector as the context, this research text-mines and content-analyzes 743 pertinent travel blogs that contain the phrase “pleasant surprise, ” “delightful surprise, ” excellent surprise, ” or “positive surprise ” and finds that the most frequent cause of guest delight in the hotel sector appears to be customer service, followed by cleanliness. In addition, this study also finds that triggers of delight are statistically different for <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> travel and for travelers to more-developed versus less-developed countries.

Such ‘post-conflict elections’ are now a feature of almost all efforts to democratize war-torn regions, with peace agreements routinely including provisions for elections be held as {{part of the process of}} conflict termination, often with the assistance, supervision or sometimes direct control of the international community. But while post-conflict elections have become an integral element of contemporary peace agreements, they can also themselves become the focus of increasing tension and renewed violence. Taking a comparative perspective, this paper focuses on several inherent dilemmas of post- conflict elections, including issues of timing, sequencing, mechanics, political parties, and the role of the international community. In each of these areas, post-conflict elections forces difficult choices to be made between short-term versus long-term priorities, representation <b>versus</b> stability, <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> legitimacy, and a range of other sometimes incompatible objectives...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Understanding {{the spatial}} {{dimensions}} of tourism {{is one of}} the core challenges for geographers involved in tourism studies. The aim in this paper is to pursue a geographical analysis of uneven patterns of tourism in South Africa and specifically to unpack the key trends observed in the country‟s tourism space economy. The analysis is conducted between three groupings of municipalities as destinations or tourism spaces. These three groups are demarcated as the metropolitan areas, the rural spaces of the priority district municipalities, and what is called the intermediate space of the remaining non-priority district municipalities. The findings show the dominance of South Africa‟s tourism space economy by the metropolitan areas. In addition, the analysis shows these three different tourism spaces exhibit different trajectories in terms of growth performance (numbers of trips, bednights and visitor spend), origin of visitors (<b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international)</b> and purpose of travel (leisure, business, VFR and other). Interpreting the characteristics of these tourism spaces is an essential first step for improved local tourism planning...|$|R

We maintain that despite the apparent diversity of events of financial instability, a useful summary categorisation is between bank, market-price and market-liquidity based crises.

We derive a framework for analysing the evolution of such crises, highlighting that it is vulnerability of a financial system that is the key common element to a crisis, besides the nature of propagation of a crisis to the wider economy. Besides having general applicability, notably to OECD countries, the typology and generic features have some relevant implications for euro area countries.

40|$|Tourism {{may have}} a {{favourable}} impact on economic growth and development in Africa. In South Africa, tourism is widely seen to be a growth catalyst {{and to be able}} to contribute towards the economic upliftment of poorer regions. The magnitude of the impact of tourist spending may, however, depend on the extent of leakages from the country or region, and the ability of the region to create backward and forward linkages with other sectors. In this paper an input-output model is used to empirically quantify the impact of tourist spending in South Africa. A distinction is made between international tourist spending and domestic tourist spending. It is argued here that the sectoral effects of tourism might depend, inter alia, on the spending patterns of <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> tourists. Using an input-output model, support was found for the notion that, from a regional development perspective, there should be a stronger emphasis on the development of the domestic tourism market in South Africa over the short-term, with investments in transport services and infrastructure as a strategy over the longer-term to reduce path dependency effects more inherent in international tourism.

40|$|Quantities with right-skewed {{distributions}} are {{ubiquitous in}} complex social systems, including political conflict, economics and social networks, and these systems sometimes produce extremely large events. For instance, the 9 / 11 terrorist events produced nearly 3000 fatalities, nearly six {{times more than}} the next largest event. But, was this enormous loss of life statistically unlikely given modern terrorism’s historical record? Accurately estimating the probability of such an event is complicated by the large fluctuations in the empirical distribution’s upper tail. We present a generic statistical algorithm for making such estimates, which combines semi-parametric models of tail behavior and a non-parametric bootstrap. Applied to a global database of terrorist events, we estimate the worldwide historical probability of observing at least one 9 / 11 -sized or larger event since 1968 to be 11 – 35 %. These results are robust to conditioning on global variations in economic development, <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> events, the type of weapon used and a truncated history that stops at 1998.

Results from three {{studies indicate that}} moral identity importance tends to increase donations to out-groups (Iraq, Indonesia) and not to in-groups (London, New Orleans). How-ever, this occurs only for consumers with a feminine gender identity. For consumers with a masculine gender identity, moral identity importance increases donations to the in-group but not the out-group. Inclusion of Other in the Self (IOS) mediates the moderating role of gender identity {{on the effect of}} moral identity on in-group and out-group donations. Donating to charitable causes is an incontrovertible partof the American consumer’s life (Brooks 2006; In-dependent Sector 2001).

These academic labour migrants include professors, lecturers, researchers and postdoctoral research fellows. The study took a qualitative approach to document the experiential perceptions of academic labour migrants at Rhodes University. In-depth interviews were conducted with twelve respondents, to analyse how academic labour migrants perceive South Africa’s changing visa policies in the context of regional integration and development, migration networks and choice, host-migrant relations.

40|$|Questions: What is the {{economic}} value {{for an individual}} to invest in physiotherapy undergraduate education in Australia? How is this affected by increased education costs or decreased wages? Design: A cost-benefit analysis using a net present value (NPV) approach was conducted and reported in Australian dollars. In relation to physiotherapy education, the NPV represents future earnings as a physiotherapist minus the direct and indirect costs in obtaining the degree. Sensitivity {{analyses were conducted to}} consider varying levels of experience, public versus private sector, and <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> student fees. Comparable calculations were made for educational investments in medicine and nursing/midwifery. Results: Assuming an expected discount rate of 9. 675 %, investment in education by domestic students with approximately 34 years of average work experience yields a NPV estimated at $ 784, 000 for public sector physiotherapists and $ 815, 000 for private sector therapists. In relation to international students, the NPV results for an investment and career as a physiotherapist is estimated at $ 705, 000 in the public sector and $ 736, 000 in the private sector. Conclusion: With an approximate payback period of 4 years, coupled with strong and positive NPV values, physiotherapy education in Australia is a financially attractive prospect and a viable value proposition for those considering a career in this field.

This issue is particular novel and important as users provide information that will be very useful for generating new products and making the innovation process more efficient. The findings confirm that cooperation with users is a tool for progress and development as it has a positive influence on both input and output of firms? innovation process. This paper makes three important contributions to the literature. First, we analyse the effect of cooperation with users on how firms distribute their R&D expenditures (basic research, applied research and technological development) in order to make clear how this tool can affect the different strategies for generating knowledge. Second, we also study the impact of this kind of cooperation on the degree of novelty of new products, with the aim of explaining how it affects the productivity of R&D activities. Third, to estimate these effects, the study analyses these relationships and explore the role of proximity in the cooperation with users taking into account the location of this agent (<b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> users). Results confirm that cooperation with users increases investments in activities that generate knowledge with a specific practical objective and which are near to firms? technological domain (applied research and technological development). Independently of user?s location, firms increase their investment in technological development to act quickly in the market and to obtain profits. The study also concludes that cooperation with users has positive effects on innovation outputs and its degree of novelty (radical versus incremental innovations). Nonetheless, these effects are different according to user?s location. Cooperation with domestic users stimulates the sales of radical innovations and cooperation with international users increase sales of incremental innovations.

40|$|For an {{engineering}} course {{to be effective}} and acceptable to industry it must be continually revised to incorporate new technology and the latest thinking. Traditionally, the method used was to approach companies in the immediate locale of the teaching institution and elicit membership to form an industrial advisory board (IAB). The IAB had limited power and influence over activities within the school and was most prominent in ensuring the course obtained accreditation from an appropriate and relevant body. However, as industry transitioned first into international and then global companies, the geographically centric advisory board became a limitation; the original strengths and benefits of engaging with local companies were outweighed {{by the need to}} embrace cultural differences. Furthermore, as system and product integration extended beyond the single engineering disciplines, the membership of the advisory board had to be similarly extended. The most recent illustration of this is the blurring of the boundaries between Computer Science and Electronic Engineering in the emergent market for the Internet of Things. With the advent of trans-national joint degree programmes between Universities in separate continents, the problem is exacerbated. This paper looks at the challenges and approaches taken to address some of these issues when establishing an Industrial Advisory Board that is not only international, but is also multi-cultural and multi-discipline in support of a joint undergraduate degree programme in Electronic and Electrical Engineering in China. It proposes a balance between <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> organisations to ensure that the educational content delivers the widest possible opportunities to the students. Finally, it examines how an effective advisory board can assist the academic staff in delivering the most appropriate, up to date training possible through the utilisation of members of the Advisory Board. Using this approach, the School can deliver best-in-class, up-to-date knowledge and experience from an industrial perspective, combined with traditional teaching of the fundamental disciplines. By involving the Industrial Advisory Board, both students and industrialists get a richer, more relevant experience and interaction...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{corporate}} reputation {{has gained}} {{the attention of}} many scholars in the strategic management and related fields. There is a general consensus that higher corporate reputation is positively related to firm success or performance. However, the link is not always straightforward; as a result, it calls for researchers to dedicate their efforts to investigate the causes and effects of firm reputation {{and how it is}} related to performance. In this doctoral dissertation, innovation is suggested as a mediating variable in this relationship. Innovation is a critical factor for firm success and survival. Highly reputed firms are in a more advantageous position to attract critical resources for innovation such as human and financial capital. These firms face constant pressure from external stakeholders, e. g. the general public, or customers, to achieve and remain at high levels of innovativeness. As a result, firms are in constant search, internally or externally, for new technologies expanding their knowledge base. Consequently, these firms engage in firms acquisitions. In the dissertation, the author assesses the effects of <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> acquisitions as well as related versus unrelated acquisitions on the level of innovativeness and performance. ^ Building upon an established measure of firm-level degree of internationalization (DOI), the dissertation proposes a more detailed and enhanced measure for the firm 2 ̆ 7 s DOI. It is modeled as an interaction effect between corporate reputation and resources for innovation. More specifically, firms with higher levels of internationalization will have access to resources for innovation, i. e. human and financial capital, at a global scale. Additionally, the distance between firms and higher education institutions, i. e. universities, is considered as another interaction effect for the human capital attraction. ^ The dissertation is built on two theoretical frameworks, the resource-based view of the firm and institutional theory. It studies 211 U. S. firms using a longitudinal panel data structure from 2006 to 2012. It utilizes a linear dynamic panel data estimation methodology for its hypotheses analyses.

40|$|We study {{jury trial}} waivers in a data set of 2, 816 {{contracts}} contained as exhibits in Form 8 -K filings by reporting corporations during 2002. Because these contracts {{are associated with}} events deemed material to the financial condition of SEC-reporting firms, they likely are carefully negotiated by sophisticated, well-informed parties and thus provide presumptive evidence about the value associated with the availability of jury trials. A minority of contracts, about 20 percent, waived jury trials. An additional 9 percent of contracts had arbitration clauses that effectively preclude jury trials though the reason for arbitration clauses need not specifically relate to juries. We explore three groups of factors to explain the pattern of jury trial waivers: (1) contract-specific factors: {{the subject matter of}} a contract, a measure of its standardization, choice of law, and choice of forum, (2) contracting-party factors: <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> status, place of business, place of incorporation, attorney locale, and industry, and (3) factors external to the contracts and parties: perceptions of jury fairness in the forum specified in the contract and the relative length of jury and bench trial queues in that forum. Contract type is significantly associated with jury trial waivers. For example, over 50 percent of security agreements and over 60 percent of credit commitments waived jury trials. In contrast, 5 percent of employment contracts, 2 percent of bond indentures, and 3. 5 percent of pooling service agreements waived jury trials. The presence of a forum selection clause, greater contract standardization, and perceived fairness of juries are significantly associated with jury trial waivers. Over 80 percent of the contracts designating Illinois as a forum contained jury trial waivers whereas less than half the contracts designating New York as a forum, and only about one-third of the contracts designating California, Texas, or Florida as a forum, contained waiver clauses. Jury trial waivers were not more common in international contracts. Our results suggest that, contrary to a widespread perception about the alleged inadequacies of juries in complex business cases, sophisticated actors may perceive that juries add value to dispute resolution...|$|R
40|$|Many {{renewable}} resources, such as fish stocks, {{water or}} environmental quality, are shared between different countries. The management of such resources then relies on international agreements. We develop {{a model of}} a shared renewable resource for which there is an international agreement that determines each country’s share of total extractions. Each government is responsible for the enforcement of their national quota. The countries can cheat on the agreement by reducing enforcement efforts and thereby inducing their firms to violate their quotas. We analyze the effects of this in a differential game framework. There are two games. First, a Stackelberg game {{between the government and the}} firms within each country. Second, an enforcement game at the international level between different governments. Our results suggest that no free-riding only occurs if countries have asymmetric beliefs regarding the environmental preferences of rival countries. The extent of free-riding in enforcement can be influenced by both domestic and international policy instruments. The effectiveness of <b>domestic</b> instruments (legislation) <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> instruments (treaties) depends to a large extent on resource dynamics and the countries’ preferences for sustainability...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the entrepreneurial internationalisation activities of Australian Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) through an entrepreneurial theoretical perspective. The field of international entrepreneurship evolved from McDougall&rsquo;s (1989) study which compared <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> new ventures and provided an early {{definition of the}} term &lsquo;international entrepreneurship&rsquo; (IE) as new ventures that engaged in international business. Research in IE has mainly focused on new patterns and timing of SME internationalisation without reference to entrepreneurship theory as the primary theme. According to Shane and Venkataraman (2000, p. 218) entrepreneurship theory is &lsquo;the &lsquo;study of discovery, evaluation, and exploitation of opportunities&rsquo;. Oviatt and McDougall (2005, p. 540) define IE as &lsquo;the discovery, enactment, evaluation, and exploitation of opportunities &ndash; across national borders &ndash; to create future goods and services&rsquo;. International new venture creation, a process influenced by founder-managers, firm characteristics and capabilities, and the external environment, is examined through an entrepreneurial theoretical lens. This thesis was undertaken for three key reasons. The first was to examine entrepreneurial internationalisation through an entrepreneurial theoretical lens as opposed to using international business theories. The second was to conduct qualitative studies to investigate and advance theoretical insights. Finally, the examination of entrepreneurial internationalisation utilising entrepreneurship as the primary theme encompassed issues such as opportunity recognition and exploitation. Case study was the prime methodology for this research and in-depth case interviews were conducted with eight founders and senior managers involved in internationalisation. Multiple sources of data were used for validity and reliability through triangulation. The sample consisted of eight internationalised Australian ICT SMEs that produce hardware or software for international markets. The findings revealed that firstly, opportunity seeking actors have the ability to scan and exploit trends of change and introduce new products, services or processes by starting a new international venture. Secondly, opportunity seeking drives firms to leapfrog stages of international strategies when this suits the opportunity being exploited. Thirdly, agile entrepreneurial firms have the ability to innovate rapidly and simultaneously to adapt and integrate product, processes, services and strategies to match and create global ICT markets. Finally, agile entrepreneurial firms have the ability to collaborate and manage partnerships with internal and external stakeholders for knowledge creation and risk sharing. Overall, the findings support other findings that international entrepreneurship is a dynamic and adaptive phenomenon (Evangelista 2005; Coviello, McDougall &amp; Oviatt 2011; Jones, Coviello &amp; Tang 2011). Through the entrepreneurial viewpoint of internationalisation, the results reveal that there is a &lsquo;hostile&rsquo; and small Australian ICT market which has fostered opportunity-seeking and advantage-seeking behaviour for founders and managers of ICT SMEs. Management teams are seeking global opportunities that increase firm sales and profitability. They are seeking global advantages by collaborating with partners that give them the best advantages for knowledge creation and risk minimisation. Implications for theory suggest that a holistic view of entrepreneurial internationalisation should be dynamic, so that entrepreneurial firms adapt readily and collaborate with internal and external stakeholders to create wealth...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addressed people’s <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> foreign cultural consumption. In many countries, {{including the}} Netherlands {{which is the}} main focus of this dissertation, a large share of the cultural goods people consume originates from foreign cultures. However, in contrast with increasing economic interdependencies and growing flows of foreign imports, domestic music artists have become increasingly popular since the late 1980 s in the Netherlands and other Western countries (Achterberg et al., 2011; Frith, 2004; Hitters and Van de Kamp, 2010; Wolther, 2008). Though research has examined the popularity of domestic culture at a macro level, it is largely unknown to what extent the distinction between domestic and foreign culture is a structuring dimension in individuals’ cultural consumption and which groups are more likely to consume domestic culture and why. Therefore, this dissertation studied {{the extent to which the}} music people listen to, the books people read and the films people watch originate from the country they live in or from abroad, i. e. to what extent people ‘consume the nation’. The distinction between domestic and foreign cultural goods is mainly assessed by the current residence of the artist. The aim of this dissertation was threefold: (1) to examine the extent to which the distinction between domestic and foreign cultural goods is a separate dimension of cultural consumption behaviour, (2) to study which groups are likely to consume <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> foreign cultural goods, and (3) to examine whether nationalist attitudes play a role in the choice for <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> foreign cultural consumption. The first main conclusion is that <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> foreign cultural consumption can be empirically distinguished from previously defined dimensions of cultural consumption such as people’s general cultural (dis-) engagement and high- and lowbrow (or emerging) consumption. Consequently, the distinction between domestic and foreign cultural goods seems to play a role in people’s cultural consumption patterns and seems a valuable subject for further research. Secondly, the current study has extended the focus of cultural consumption research by showing that <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> foreign cultural consumption is stratified by education and social class. Individuals’ educational level is negatively related to <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> foreign cultural consumption. Higher social classes (high- and low-grade professionals) are less likely to consume <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> foreign cultural goods than middle classes (routine non-manuals and lower service sales employees) and lower classes (skilled manual workers, and semi-unskilled manual workers). This social stratification cannot be fully explained by individuals’ nationalist attitudes or the (middle- or lowbrow) genre or language of the cultural goods. Finally, this dissertation showed that nationalist attitudes (i. e. chauvinism and cultural patriotism) are manifested in <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> foreign consumption and provides insights into nationalist behaviour in everyday life. Concluding, this study has indicated the relevance of <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> foreign cultural consumption on the micro level and has provided future studies with indications that the consumption of <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> foreign cultural goods might mark group boundaries both in terms of social position as well as in terms of nationalist attitudes...|$|R

Two pairs of beef strip steaks were evaluated - <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> Australian grass-fed and <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> Canadian. Consumers gave significantly higher scores for flavor, tenderness and overall acceptability to domestic steaks compared to Australian grass-fed steaks and Canadian steaks. A significantly higher value also {{was placed on the}} domestic samples compared to Australian grass-fed steaks ($ 3. 68 /lb versus $ 2. 48 /lb) and Canadian steaks ($ 3. 95 /lb versus $ 3. 57 /lb). U. S. consumers preferred and were willing to pay significantly more for domestic steaks than Australian and Canadian steaks...|$|R

First, how can partner selection {{be used as a}} mechanism to minimize R&D alliance participants?????? concerns about knowledge leakage? And {{what is the nature of}} the relationship among partner selection and two previously-studied protection mechanisms ?????? governance structure and alliance scope? Extending this research question to the international context, the second set of research questions asks how international R&D alliances differ from their domestic counterparts in partner selection to protect their participants?????? valuable knowledge, and how different types of international R&D alliances vary in this regard. Distinguishing bilateral from multilateral R&D alliances, this dissertation examines a third set of questions about how multilateral R&D alliances differ from bilateral ones in partner selection for the purpose of protecting participants?????? technological assets. Hypotheses are proposed and tested with a sample of 2, 185 R&D alliances involving companies in high technology industries. Results indicate that the more radical the innovation an R&D alliance intends to develop, the more likely the alliance will be formed between Friends than Strangers. However, under the same situation, firms are less likely to select Acquaintances than Strangers. A substitution effect was detected among partner selection, governance structure, and alliance scope used by firms to protect their valuable technological assets from being appropriated in R&D alliances. In addition, no empirical support was found for different partner selection preferences for firms forming <b>domestic</b> R&D alliances <b>versus</b> <b>international</b> R&D alliances. However, results show that firms, when forming trinational R&D alliances and/or traditional international R&D alliances, are more likely to select their prior partners than when forming cross-nation domestic R&D alliances. Moreover, this study shows that when an R&D alliance is formed by multiple companies, partner firms are more likely to be prior partners. I argue that concerns about knowledge leakage explain this result...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{research}} conducted on economic sectors in the U. S., Germany, Australia and Scotland {{has shown that}} factors such as age, size, location, legal form, and industry are related to business growth rates. Much of this {{research has focused on}} manufacturing firms thus providing little information about the effect of industrial sector differences upon the factors that are found to be significant. This article uses Swedish data to replicate the previous research while using a different definition of business to enhance the study of effects from industry, <b>international</b> <b>versus</b> <b>domestic</b> businesses, and <b>domestic</b> <b>versus</b> foreign ownership. We seek to confirm that small independent firms demonstrate the greatest growth rates in Sweden as elsewhere and to explore the effects of different industrial sectors on this conclusion. Multiple regression analysis with growth as the dependent variable shows that business age (younger grow more), beginning size (smaller grow more), independence of ownership, type of business activities (indus-trial sectors), and legal form are the most important factors related to growth. Although business growth differs among industrial sectors, across all sectors youth, ownership independence and small size are major factors that underlie growth across all industrial sectors...|$|R
