40|$|Wheel loaders in the V-type {{loading cycle}} are {{characterized}} by complicated loading conditions, nonlinear power-train system, and time-variable engine power distribution. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} predict the fuel consumption of wheel loaders in the V-type loading cycle. The static matching methods cannot provide fuel consumption prediction for the loading cycle. In this paper, the prediction method and model of the fuel consumption for wheel loaders in the V-type loading cycle were proposed. Firstly, the hydraulic system data were tested when a wheel loader loaded three different materials in a typical V-type loading cycle. Secondly, the tested data were filtered by the 8 th-order Butterworth filter and the dimensionless power deduction equations of hydraulic power system for loading three different materials were obtained by Gaussian and linear fitting based on the filtered data in the loading cycle. Finally, fuel consumption was obtained with the compiling <b>dynamic</b> <b>calculation</b> program as well as input parameters of tested vehicle speed, throttle parameter, and the dimensionless equation.

40|$|The {{construction}} of new high speed railway infrastructure in many European countries is actually a great civil engineering effort. One of the main design issues {{is related to the}} fact that trains at speeds above 220 km/h may induce resonance effects in structures as bridges, subway frames, etc. In consequence, the design of such structures requires <b>dynamic</b> <b>calculations.</b> Several methods are available for the <b>dynamic</b> <b>calculations</b> of structures under high speed train loads.

These methodologies suitable for hyperestatic structures, performed on full or reduced models, are discussed in this paper.

40|$|To {{study the}} phase {{transformation}} mechanism and gas dynamic {{process for the}} laser-ablated plume, direct and indirect evidences of potential laser ablation mechanisms were sought experimentally and analytically. Two phase transformation mechanisms, normal vaporization and phase explosion, were introduced as the laser ablation mechanisms for the interaction between a KrF excimer laser (λ = 248 nm) and a nickel specimen in ambient air. For each experimental condition the flow processes of the plume were modeled based on gas dynamic theories. Measuring the velocity of the plume front, the transmissivity of the plume, and laser energy loss to the ambient, the laser-ablated plume was diagnosed experimentally. Employing the measured velocity of the plume front as an input variable for the gas <b>dynamic</b> <b>calculations</b> of the normal vaporization model and performing the calculations, the laser ablation mechanism was determined analytically. As the laser fluence increases, both experimental and analytical studies show evidence of a transition of the laser ablation mechanism from normal vaporization to phase explosion at a laser fluence of 5. 0 J/cm 2. To verify this transition, the recoil pressure exerted on the target surface was also calculated from the gas <b>dynamic</b> <b>calculations,</b> and compared to the measured value obtained by using a PVDF transducer and the impedance mismatch method. As a result, the use of gas <b>dynamic</b> <b>calculations</b> for the normal vaporization model was validated when the laser fluence was less than 5. 0 J/cm 2, and the transition of the laser ablation mechanism was confirmed. Morphological studies of ablation craters were performed to obtain direct evidence of phase explosion, and showed re-solidified droplets deposited {{on the periphery of}} the ablation crater when the laser fluence was greater than 5. 0 J/cm 2. Finally, the ablation rate was measured and compared to the calculated value obtained based on equilibrium evaporation kinetics and the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The comparison showed that the Clausius-Clapeyron equation was inappropriate for the temperature-pressure relation at the target surface during pulsed laser ablation. ...|$|R
