50|$|The {{competitive}} {{procedure with}} negotiation {{may only be}} used in cases where the contracting authority's needs cannot be met through use of 'readily available solutions' without their adaptation, where there is a design or innovation element to the goods, works or services to be procured, where the nature, complexity or legal and financial aspects of contractual risk demand a negotiated solution. In addition, where a procurement for goods, works or services falling outside the above criteria has been undertaken and only <b>irregular</b> or unacceptable <b>tenders</b> have been received, the contracting authority may then adopt the {{competitive procedure with negotiation}} as the next stage of the procurement process.|$|R
