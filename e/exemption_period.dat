On October 6, Prime Minister of the Bahamas Perry Christie signed an order waiving import duties on materials needed for rebuilding by storm victims and registered charities on 12 islands. Local leaders called for {{an extension of the}} three-month <b>exemption</b> <b>period,</b> which many saw as inadequate. In what residents feared to be a major economic setback, storm-related damage forced Club Med to delay the annual opening of its San Salvador resort—the largest employer on the island—by two months. At the end of October, the National Emergency Management Agency began to shift its focus from emergency relief distribution to permanent rebuilding efforts.|$|E

Silk production (introduced in Tours in 1470 and in Lyon in 1536) enabled the French to join a thriving market, but French products remained of lesser quality than Italian silks. Wool production was widespread, as was the production of linen and of hemp (both major export products).|$|R
2500|$|As a {{follow-up}} to earlier legislation, in 1985 the eligibility of projects in the restricted area for 421-a tax benefits was restricted to projects that either received financial help from any level of government or had 20% of their housing units be certified by the HPD to be affordable. The restricted area {{at that time was}} in Manhattan, roughly bounded by 14th Street to the south and 96th Street to the north. Outside of the excluded zone area, projects had an [...] "as-of-right" [...] exemption of between ten and fifteen years. In addition, the 1985 legislation allowed for a 25-year <b>exemption</b> <b>period</b> if the project took place in a neighborhood preservation area, was in an area eligible for mortgage insurance made available by the rehabilitation mortgage insurance corporation, or received funding under the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation Act.

5000|$|The above {{outlined}} {{debt brake}} rule, already entered into {{force at the}} EU level on 13 December 2011, {{as part of the}} amendment of EU Regulation 1467/97 introduced by the sixpack reform. As it is also {{an essential part of the}} Fiscal Compact, the signatories are encouraged to refer to EU Regulation 1467/97 when they implement the rule into domestic law. For transitional reasons, the regulation granted all 23 EU Member States with an ongoing EDP in November 2011, a 3-year <b>exemption</b> <b>period</b> to comply with the rule, which will start in the year when the member state have its 2011-EDP abrogated. For example, Ireland will only be obliged to comply with the new debt brake rule in 2019, if they, as expected, manage to correct their EDP in fiscal year 2015 - with the formal EDP abrogation then taking place in 2016. During the years where the 23 member states are exempted from complying with the new debt brake rule, they are still obliged to comply with the old debt brake rule that requires the debt-to-GDP ratios in excess of 60% to be [...] "sufficiently diminished", meaning that it must approach the 60% reference value at a [...] "satisfactory pace" [...] ensuring it will succeed to meet the debt reduction requirement of the new debt brake rule three years after its EDP is abrogated.

25|$|The most {{important}} legal instruments {{for the promotion}} of renewable energy are Law 25,019 from 1998 and Law 26,190 from 2007. The 1998 law, known as the “National Wind and Solar Energy Rules”, declared wind and solar generation of national interest and introduced a mechanism that established an additional payment per generated kWh which, in 1998, meant a 40% premium over market price. It also granted certain tax <b>exemptions</b> for a <b>period</b> of 15 years from the law's promulgation. The 2007 Law complemented the previous one, declaring of national interest the generation of electricity from any renewable source intended to deliver a public service. This law also set an 8% target for renewable energy consumption in the period of 10 years and mandated the creation of a trust fund whose resources will be allocated to pay a premium for electricity produced from renewable sources.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the nexus between life insurance and suicide behavior using OECD cross-country data from 1980 to 2002. Through semiparametric instrumental variable regressions with fixed effects, {{we find that}} {{for the majority of}} observations, there exists a positive relationship between suicide rate and life insurance density (premium per capita). Since life insurance policies pay death benefits even in suicide cases after the suicide <b>exemption</b> <b>period,</b> the presence of adverse selection and moral hazard suggests an incentive effect that leads to this positive relationship. The novelty of our analysis lies in the use of cross-country variations in the length of the suicide <b>exemption</b> <b>period</b> in life insurance policies as the identifying instrument for life insurance density. Our results provide compelling evidence suggesting the existence of adverse selection and moral hazards in life insurance markets in OECD countries. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCommon suicide clauses {{preclude}} protection {{coverage for}} insureds whokill themselves {{during the first}} few years of exemption. Similar clauses have beenadopted by Islamic insurance (takaful) companies. Is this justan emulation of what has been practiced by the conventional insurer or is there any basis in Islamic law that supports this practice?This paper attempts to examine the Islamic perspective on the act of suicide and the current practices of the Malaysian takaful operators regarding the coverage of this event. The issue is whether it is appropriate for takaful operators to exclude the coverage in the event of suicide, as it is established based on mutual help, solidarity and brotherhood. Although suicide is an unacceptable act in Islam, the main concern in the case of theoccurrence of this act is the welfare of the next of kin who may have lost their main breadwinner. It was found that, in the past, the act of suicide was not covered by takafuloperators, and, thus, the beneficiaries are not entitled to claim compensation on the death of the participant due to suicide. However,it is observed that thepractice is changing, whereby the trend is that takaful operators are allowingthe beneficiaries to claim compensation on the participant s death due to suicide albeit after the <b>exemption</b> <b>period.</b> The paper explores the Shariahjustification deliberated by theShariah committee members of the takaful operators in their decision to allow such compensation. The main focus of our examination is whether this practiceis allowed in accordance with the purpose of Islamic law (maqasidal-Shariah) ...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} article, we argued that {{contrary to the}} state of the law over 35 years ago — when George Cooper wrote his seminal article on the estate tax (A Voluntary Tax? New Perspectives on Sophisticated Estate Tax Avoidance, 77 Colum. L. Rev. 161 (1977)) —taxpayers today generally ‘‘can reduce the value of assets subject to transfer tax in many instances only if they are willing to assume the risk that the reduction may be economically real and reduce the actual value of assets transferred to heirs or, alternatively, in narrow situations if they are willing to incur some tax risk. ’’ (The Estate Tax Non-Gap: Why Repeal a Voluntary Tax?, 20 Stan. L. 2 ̆ 6 Pol’y Rev. 153 (2009)) In another article, we documented the dramatic increase in income and wealth inequality over the past 30 years and the accompanying adverse social consequences and long-term negative effect on economic growth. (Occupy the Tax Code: Using the Estate Tax to Reduce Inequality and Spur Economic Growth, 40 Pepp. L. Rev. 1255 (2013)) We argued that tax policy historically has {{played an important role in}} reducing inequality and that the estate tax is a particularly apt reform vehicle in light of the role of inherited assets among the very rich and the adverse economic effects of that inherited wealth. In this article, we advance five estate and gift tax reform proposals that would generate needed revenue, reduce inequality, and contribute to economic growth: (1) disallow minority discounts when the transferred asset or business is controlled by family before and after the transfer; (2) maintain parity between the unified credit exemption amounts for the estate and gift taxes; (3) reduce the wealth transfer tax exemptions to 3. 5 million, increase the maximum tax rate to 45 percent, and limit the generation-skipping transfer tax (GSST) <b>exemption</b> <b>period</b> to 50 years; (4) restrict the ability for gifts made in trust to qualify for the gift tax annual exclusion; and (5) impose a lifetime cap on the amount that can be contributed to a grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT). This article was presented on January 17 at a symposium in Malibu, California cosponsored by Pepperdine University School of Law and Tax Analysts. Twenty of the nation’s leading tax academics, practitioners, and journalists gathered to discuss the prospects for tax reform as it is affected by two crises facing Washington: dangerously misaligned spending and tax policies, resulting in a crippling 17. 4 trillion national debt; and the IRS’s alleged targeting of conservative political organizations.

50|$|Independent {{schools in}} British Columbia are {{partially}} financed by municipal governments by Statutory and Permissive tax exemptions. The {{objective of the}} legislation appears to be {{to level the playing}} field between the private and public sector schools. These tax <b>exemptions</b> over a <b>period</b> of time result in considerable investment by municipal governments in the private school sector, yet legally they have no stake in the properties, as they remain in private hands. Depending on the financial structure of the school, parents may have a financial stake while their offspring are enrolled, but the investment is not continuous, and the enrollment deposit, which finances the school's capital expenditures, is returned upon leaving the school. The returned deposit is paid from the subsequent new enrollment, and it follows that no parent makes a long term investment in the school.The municipal governments appear on balance to be the only long term investors, through the statutory and permissive tax exemptions, with no right to recapture these costs if the school is dissolved or any part of the assets is disposed of.|$|R
40|$|The present Iowa laws {{pertaining}} to landlord-tenant relationships do {{not distinguish between}} urban and agricultural conditions, with only two exceptions: The agricultural landlord’s lien and the termination of indefinite agricultural leases. This lien applies to the total crop and to all personal property of the tenant, except to the property exempted from execution. In addition, leases usually contain a provision in which the tenant waives his <b>exemption</b> rights. In <b>periods</b> of excessive price decline or crop failure, and if production credit is sought by the tenant, the landlord’s lien may work serious hardship. As a possible corrective, placing of certain limitations on the landlord’s lien, and declaring invalid any waivers of exemption rights might be considered. An Iowa statute provides that any lease with a fixed date of termination shall expire without notice and that only 1 month’s notice is necessary to terminate an indefinite tenancy. The old common law rule provided for a 6 months’ period of notice for termination of leases without a definite expiration date. It was changed by legislation {{in order to accommodate}} urban tenants and landlords. A statute requiring a 6 months’ notice for the termination of any farm lease would be better adapted to agricultural needs...|$|R
