5|$|The P90 uses {{a unique}} {{horizontally}} mounted feeding system—patented in the United States—that {{contributes to the}} weapon's compact profile and unusual appearance. U.S. Patent 4,905,394 ("Top mounted longitudinal magazine") was awarded in 1990, naming René Predazzer as the sole inventor. The detachable box magazine is mounted parallel to the P90's barrel, fitting flush with {{the top of the}} weapon's frame, and it contains 50 rounds of ammunition which lie in two rows facing left, offset 90° from the bore axis. As the cartridges are pushed back by spring pressure and arrive at the rear end of the magazine, they are fed as a single row into a spiral <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> and rotated 90 degrees, aligning them with the chamber. The magazine body is composed of polymer, and it is semi-transparent to allow the shooter to see the amount of ammunition remaining at any time.|$|E
2500|$|The Beretta 92 pistol {{evolved from}} earlier Beretta designs, {{most notably the}} M1923 and M1951. From the M1923 comes the open slide design, while the alloy frame and locking block barrel, {{originally}} from Walther P38, were first used in the M1951. The grip angle and the front sight integrated with the slide were also common to earlier Beretta pistols. What were perhaps the Model 92's two most important advanced design features had first appeared on its immediate predecessor, the 1974 [...]380 caliber Model 84. These improvements both involved the magazine, which featured direct feed; that is, there was no <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> between the magazine and the chamber (a Beretta innovation in pistols). In addition, the magazine was a [...] "double-stacked" [...] design, a feature originally introduced in 1935 on the Browning Hi-Power.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]40 S {{has been}} noted {{in a number of}} {{cartridge}} case failures, particularly in older Glock pistols due to the relatively large area of unsupported case head in those barrels, given its high working pressure. The <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> on the Glock [...]40 S pistols is larger than on other Glocks, which leaves the rear bottom of the case unsupported, and it is in this unsupported area that the cases fail. Most, but not all, of the failures have occurred with reloaded or remanufactured ammunition. Cartridges loaded at or above the SAAMI pressure, or slightly oversized cases which fire slightly out of battery are often considered to be the cause of these failures, which are commonly referred to as [...] "kaBooms" [...] or [...] "kB!" [...] for short. While these case failures do not often injure the person holding the pistol, the venting of high pressure gas tends to eject the magazine out of the magazine well in a spectacular fashion, and usually destroys the pistol. In some cases, the barrel will also fail, blowing the top of the chamber off.|$|E
50|$|In newer pistols the {{magazines}} are positioned 2 mm {{higher in the}} gun to get the rounds nearer to the <b>feeding</b> <b>ramp.</b> The required replacement part to position the magazine higher in older pistols that exhibit feeding problems is offered by Tanfoglio Germany for their customers without charge.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>feeding</b> <b>ramp</b> {{between the}} ESP85 and ESP85A {{is also a}} bit different. While one may attach the barrel to the frame, the trigger will not work, because {{rearward}} movement will stop against the feeding-ramp. But a usable conversion {{can be made with}} the help of a gunsmith.|$|R
50|$|Upper {{and lower}} receivers: The rifles were {{produced}} by the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) at Fort Benning, Georgia using either new semi-automatic ArmaLite lower receivers or existing Army M16A2 or A4 lower receivers previously supplied by either Colt or Fabrique Nationale de Herstal. All rifles were equipped with a fixed A2 stock and a Knight's Armament Company 2-stage match grade trigger capable of only semi-automatic fire. The upper receivers were flat-top style, but unlike the SAM-R and SPR, {{they did not have}} extended <b>feed</b> <b>ramps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> is {{a common}} point of {{mechanical}} failure {{that leads to a}} [...] "jam" [...] of an automatic pistol. A rough surface or the presence of debris on the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> will eventually lead to the bullet being directed off-center, causing the gun to fail to complete the reloading cycle. Polishing a <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> is among the tasks commonly performed by gunsmiths.|$|E
50|$|The <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> is a {{critical}} part of a semi-automatic pistol or automatic rifle. When the pistol is fired and the spent case is ejected, the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> functions to direct a fresh cartridge from the magazine into firing position; that is, the slides along the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> into battery. The need for the cartridge to slide both forwards and upwards along the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> and into the barrel is the primary design consideration that makes the ogive the preferred shape for all modern automatic pistol rounds (a hollow point bullet is a truncated ogive), as there are many other shapes that are stable in ballistic flight.|$|E
50|$|<b>Feed</b> <b>ramp</b> {{is a basic}} {{feature of}} many breech loading {{cartridge}} firearm designs. It is a tightly machined and polished piece of metal which guides the cartridge {{at the top of}} the magazine into the firing chamber of the barrel. Depending on design, the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> may be part of the magazine (AR-7), part of the receiver or frame (Mauser C96), or part of the barrel (H&K USP). However, some firearms, like the FN Five-seven, have a beveled chamber instead of a <b>feed</b> <b>ramp.</b>|$|E
40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate using RAMP, a complete starter feed (Cargill Corn Milling, Blair NE) which contains {{a high level of}} Sweet Bran and a minimal amount of forage, for receiving lightweight calves and adapting cattle to high-grain diets. Two {{experiments were}} conducted to compare <b>feeding</b> <b>RAMP</b> with a traditional receiving diet to lightweight calves for the first 30 d of the feeding period. Seven experiments compared using RAMP to adapt cattle to high grain diets to a traditional grain adaptation program or evaluated using RAMP to adapt cattle to high grain diets in fewer days. Three of these trials were metabolism studies that evaluated DMI and ruminal pH of cattle during grain adaptation. <b>Feeding</b> <b>RAMP</b> to newly received lightweight calves improved G:F and did not affect the incidence of BRD. Using RAMP to adapt cattle to high grain diets resulted in increased G:F and HCW when compared using a traditional grain adaptation program with alfalfa hay. No major differences in ruminal pH were observed between cattle adapted with RAMP or a traditional system but RAMP decreased ruminal pH variation during grain adaptation which may suggest less acidosis. In a metabolism study eliminating the adaptation period resulted in decreased ruminal pH and increased pH variance when compared to longer more traditional adaptation with more step diets. Although pH was lower in the metabolism study for cattle transitioned directly from RAMP to a finishing diet, performance was not affected in 2 feedlot trials when compared to a 4 -step adaptation program with RAMP. In the final metabolism study, regardless of adaptation period length (10 or 22 d), RAMP treatments increased eating time and average ruminal pH during the adaptation period. This may suggest less acidosis when using RAMP to start cattle on <b>feed.</b> Cattle fed <b>RAMP</b> for 10 d can be transitioned directly to a finishing diet containing 47. 5 % Sweet Bran without negatively affecting performance. ...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{of newly}} arrived 570 lb. steer calves fed RAMP or a control ration was {{evaluated}} in two trials completed in 2010 and 2011. Treatment diets were fed {{for an average}} of 31 days in year 1 and 24 days in year 2. Diets included a control receiving diet consisting of alfalfa hay, Sweet Bran®, dry rolled corn, and supplement or RAMP which is a complete starter ration containing a high level of Sweet Bran and a minimal amount of forage. Across both years, RAMP improved F:G but was due to increased ADG in year 1 and decreased DMI in year 2. <b>Feeding</b> <b>RAMP</b> to newly arrived calves improved feed efficiency the first three weeks cattle were in the feedlot...|$|R
2500|$|Behind {{the bolt}} carrier is a plastic or metal buffer, which rests {{in line with}} a return spring. The buffer spring begins to push the bolt carrier and bolt back toward the chamber once it is {{compressed}} sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver guides the bolt cam pin and prevents it and the bolt from rotating into a closed position. The bolt's locking lugs push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is guided by <b>feed</b> <b>ramps</b> into the chamber. As the bolt's locking lugs move past the barrel extension, the cam pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver. This twisting action follows the groove cut into the carrier and forces the bolt to twist and [...] "lock" [...] into the barrel extension.|$|R

5000|$|Kahr's trigger {{is similar}} to a {{double-action}} revolver, with a short -inch trigger travel. On polymer-framed models, the slide travels on steel inserts that are permanently set into the polymer frame. There are also polymer rails, which are not structurally functional, but aid in keeping out dirt, and with aligning the slide when reassembling the slide onto the polymer frame. In steel framed versions, the rail design is traditional and very {{similar to that of the}} M1911 pistol. Kahr pistols have their <b>feed</b> <b>ramps</b> offset to the left, which allows the trigger draw bar to lie flatter against the right side of the frame. This feature helps the Kahr pistol line to achieve a slide width of [...]90 of an inch in 9mm and [...]40 S&W models, and 1.01 inches when chambered in [...]45ACP, narrower than many popular pistols.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} wadcutter types exist: HBWC (Hollow Base Wadcutter), DEWC (Double-ended wadcutters), BBWC (Beveled-Base Wadcutters), and SWC (Semi-Wadcutters). HBWC rounds are best used at only the lowest velocities, as by being hollow {{at the rear}} end, they can split under heavy loads. DEWC rounds are best suited for {{automatic}} press reloading uses, {{as they may be}} used when loaded with either end pointed forward. BBWC have been developed to permit easier bullet insertion into the case when reloading. SWC rounds were developed to permit them to be loaded in either semi-automatic pistols or revolvers, where the rounded bullet shape often works better with <b>feed</b> <b>ramps</b> on semi-automatic pistols, and they are often used for heavy loads intended either for hunting or for self-defense. Some SWC bullet designs have a smaller diameter rear end, making these bullets suitable for use with gas checks. Properly lubricated SWC bullets with gas checks are suitable for use at velocities exceeding 1700 ft/s (518 m/s), the gas check reducing leading within the bore.|$|R
5000|$|During {{its service}} life, the weapon was modernized several times. Initially, the gas block was {{modified}} {{as was the}} rear sight, where the windage adjustment knob for the rear sight {{was moved to the}} left side of the notch. Later, the RPD was modified with a non-reciprocating cocking mechanism with a folding charging handle (replacing the fixed charging handle connected to the bolt carrier) that does not move during firing. The feed port received a dust cover, which when open, serves as a <b>feeding</b> <b>ramp</b> for the ammunition belt. This version of the light machine gun was produced mainly in China and Poland. A further modified variant (sometimes referred to as the RPDM) includes an extended gas cylinder and a recoil buffer mechanism in the stock. Late production RPD variants also had the fixed drum attachment removed (instead, the ammunition container was [...] "hung" [...] from the feed port cover) and feature a folding cleaning rod, that is stored in the weapon's butt (in the Chinese Type 56-1 variant).|$|R
5000|$|Brennan {{moved the}} <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> from the AR-10 barrel {{extension}} to the detachable magazines. According to Brennan, this alteration {{is one reason}} why the 45 Raptor can feed wide-mouth hollow point rounds better than competing cartridges. [...] Standard, straight-wall magazines are modified by shortening the follower and installing an insert that includes the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp.</b> Curved magazines cannot accept the insert, and are therefore incompatible with the 45 Raptor conversion. Magazine capacity is not altered.|$|E
50|$|In 2013 thin {{aluminum}} grips and a {{fiber optic}} front sight were added and improvements {{were made to}} the <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> to improve reliability.|$|E
50|$|Options offered {{with the}} K9 include Tritium night sights, and wood Hogue grips. The Elite {{version of the}} pistol offers a {{polished}} <b>feed</b> <b>ramp,</b> polished and deburred slide, beveled magazine well, and enlarged trigger with a smoother action.|$|E
50|$|The REC7 {{outfitted}} in a shortened barrel PDW configuration {{was one of}} {{the weapons}} displayed to U.S. Army officials during an invitation-only Industry Day on November 13, 2008. The goal of the Industry Day was to review current carbine technology prior to writing formal requirements for a future replacement for the M4 carbine.The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance.At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices {{do not need to be}} zeroed after routine maintenance.The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 hardcoat anodized. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 <b>feed</b> <b>ramps</b> machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle.|$|R
5000|$|Examples of 8×68mm S based wildcats are the {{relatively}} well known American 7 mm and [...]30 caliber Boo Boo and 7 mm and [...]30 HV wildcats. The Boo Boo wildcats were developed for long range target shooting where participants usually handload their ammunition. Several 1,000 yard shooting competitions have been won with Boo Boo wildcats. A wildcat from Europe {{that uses the}} 8×68mm S as its parent case is the [...]30 Kovacs. It was designed in 1996 by Stefan Kovács, Austria-7041 Wulkaprodersdorf. The [...]30 Kovacs has much more powder-room (longer L2, wider P2, 40 degree Ackley-shoulder) then its parental case. It falls powder-room-wise between the [...]300 Winchester Magnum and [...]300 Weatherby Magnum but has energy and velocity falling between [...]300 Weatherby Magnum and the [...]300 Remington Ultra Magnum. This wildcat cartridge will be fitted only by Büchsenmachermeister Egon Kriebernegg. Another European wildcat based on the 8×68mm S is the [...]300 Styria Magnum. It was developed by Ing. Michael W. Mayerl from the Styria Arms company in Austria in 2005 as a reliable beltless high power cartridge for Mauser 98 rifles. The parent case is shortened to 65 mm (2.559 in) case length and necked down to 7.82 mm (.308 in) calibre. The shoulder angle {{is the same as}} the 8×68mm S so fire forming is not necessary and no new headspace gages are needed. The development goal of this cartridge was to get a highly reliable [...]30-calibre magnum cartridge that fits in the standard Mauser 98 action without any modification of the feeding lips, follower, <b>feeding</b> <b>ramp</b> or magazine length. Only the bolt face must be opened to a diameter of 13.3 mm (0.524 in). The throat of the [...]300 Styria Magnum is similar to the proven [...]308 Winchester and short enough to seat the bullets to the lands without exceeding the maximum length of 84.8 mm (3.339 in) to fit the original Mauser 98 magazine. The thick-walled 8×68mm S parent case manufactured by RWS can handle a usage piezo pressure up to 460 MPa (66717 psi).|$|R

The box contains raised guides and holes depending on which face is showing. Beside the left ramp is a saucer containing the Small Wheel. In single-ball mode, shooting this saucer awards a random Small Wheel award, which includes lighting a timed jackpot. During multiball and after the Metamorphosis, the player must lock both balls to spin the Big Wheel, which awards larger random prizes including lighting the center ramp (called the [...] "Heartbeat Ramp") on a timed interval for a shot worth one billion points.

50|$|I-294 {{was built}} largely before {{the growth and}} {{maturation}} of the suburbs that run along the corridor. As a result, {{the vast majority of}} the interchanges are partial, or were configured to have entrance <b>ramps</b> <b>feeding</b> the toll plazas. Gaps between exit ramps are common, the 6.5 mi gap between Cicero Avenue (IL 50/IL 83) and 95th Street (US 12/US 20) being one of the more notable ones. Partial interchanges are located at Roosevelt Road (IL 38; northbound exit, southbound entrance), Irving Park Road (IL 19) (southbound exit, northbound entrance), Touhy Avenue (northbound exit, southbound entrance), Dempster Street (US 14; northbound exit, southbound entrance), and Golf Road (IL 58; southbound exit, northbound entrance). Several former partial interchanges have been converted to full interchanges, with automated toll collection facilities on the new ramps, such as at 159th Street (US 6; northbound on and southbound off added) and 95th Street (US 12/US 20; southbound on and northbound off added). The 79th Street exit was moved to 75th Street/Willow Springs Road, and made a complete interchange in the same manner.|$|R
40|$|AbstractExperimental data is {{presented}} relating to surface roughness (2 D and 3 D) and workpiece integrity when drilling unidirectional CFRP laminates with varying lay-up configurations (Type 1, 2 and 3) at different feed rates (0. 2 and 0. 4 mm/rev) using diamond coated carbide tools. Drill <b>feed</b> rate was <b>ramped</b> down to 0. 01 mm/rev {{for the final}} 0. 5 mm in all trials. Surface roughness at hole exit was typically lower (up to 4. 04 μm Ra) compared with the entry section in all tests due to the lower feed rate applied. High resolution SEM micrographs and 3 D topographic maps showed that Type 2 ([45 / 0 / 135 / 0 / 90 / 0 / 135 / 0 / 45] 2 S) lay-up gave the lowest roughness of ∼ 1. 16 μm Sa after 384 holes at a cutting speed and feed rate of 90 m/min and 0. 4 mm/rev respectively.

5000|$|Reliability of the AR-7 {{is highly}} {{dependent}} {{on the condition of}} the magazine and on the ammunition used, perhaps more so than with other models of semi-automatic [...]22 caliber rifles. The <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> is part of the magazine and subject to damage from mishandling. Flat-nosed bullets tend to jam {{on the edge of the}} chamber of the barrel. The transition of cartridge from magazine to barrel can be smoothed by minor beveling of the chamber of the barrel, by using round-nosed as opposed to flat-nosed bullets and by paying attention to condition of the feed lips and <b>feed</b> <b>ramp</b> of the magazine. Later production magazines include an external wire spring to align the cartridge; earlier magazines used two pinch marks at the top of the magazine body, which in use could become sprung open or worn.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} a modeling approach to analyzing an integrated system that includes freeway mainlines, ramp metering, and an upstream signalized diamond interchange. The modeling approach takes into {{consideration of the}} various components, their operational characteristics, and their interactions within the system. Strategies are also proposed for real-time operation and possible field implementation. The key element of achieving an integrated operation is to control the <b>ramp</b> <b>feeding</b> traffic through special signal timings at the diamond interchange. Whenever a long queue is detected at the metered ramp, the signal timing should be adjusted to reduce the traffic flows entering the ramp. In this way, the ramp meter will remain in operation {{for as long as}} possible, which would delay the onset of queue flush (i. e., termination of ramp meter) and minimize the possibilities of a freeway breakdown. Because a diamond interchange is usually controlled by special signal phasing and timing, the control strategies are specially focused on the special diamond signal phasing schemes. The system design and system architecture are also presented for potential deployment of the system in the field. Key Words: ramp metering; freeway; integration; diamond interchange...|$|R
