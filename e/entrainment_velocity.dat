40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a canal in the Gunnison Valley, located in central Utah, which diverts water from the sediment-laden Green River. Grain size {{analyses}} were performed on sediment samples taken from the canal. These grain size analyses {{were used to determine}} the grain size distribution of the fine sediment, classify the fine sediment, and compare the fine sediment to a sediment deposit in the Green River. The critical incipient velocity for the D 50 and D 100 and the critical grain <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> corresponding to the D 95 were determined through flume experimentation. Two methods, developed by prior researchers, were chosen by the author to calculate the critical incipient velocity for the D 50 and D 100 of the fine sediment in the Green River Canal. The calculated critical incipient velocity for the D 50 and D 100 was compared to the critical incipient velocity for the D 50 and D 100 as determined from flume experimentation. Using flume data and one of the previously mentioned methods, the critical grain <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> was calculated and compared to the critical grain <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> as determined by flume experimentation. This study concluded that a minimum required average velocity of 1. 14 feet per second will retain in suspension the fine sediment sampled from the Green River Canal. This minimum average critical grain <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> corresponds to the D 95 of the fine sediment deposited in the Green River Canal. However, it is recommended that further research be conducted to determine if critical incipient velocity formulae accurately estimates the critical grain <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity.</b> If so, the further research should address the grain diameter that should be used in the calculations...|$|E

40|$|The {{genesis of}} {{nummulite}} banks remains a poorly understood topic and {{the aim of}} this work is to shed light on it by observing the hydrodynamic behavior of selected larger foraminifera collected from both bank and non- bank deposits. <b>Entrainment</b> and settling <b>velocity</b> of both recent and fossil larger foraminifera were measured using a flume channel and settling tube. Both velocities give information about the reaction of foraminiferal shells to different hydrodynamic conditions affecting their capability to build bank-like sedimentary structures. To assess entrainment, experiments were performed on different substrates to simulate bed load transport on smooth surfaces, fine sand, coarse sand, and bioclastic substrates. Thirty-four recent and 49 fossil shells of foraminifera were used; recent taxa used are Operculina ammonoides, Heterostegina depressa, and Palaeonummulites venosus and fossil taxa used are Nummulites perforatus, N. fabianii, and N. tavertetensis (only A forms were used in this study). Our results seem to differentiate the hydrodynamic behavior of shells collected from banks from those collected from non-bank deposits. The latter possess settling velocities significantly lower than their <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocities,</b> while for taxa collected from nummulite banks, settling velocities are always close to <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocities.</b> Therefore, the relation between hydrodynamics and shape and size may explain why modern larger foraminifera, consistently of smaller size than fossil forms, cannot produce banks and that transport as bed load in moving water was possibly the main trigger for the production of nummulite banks...|$|R

However, the <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> can deviate from the evaporative cooling trend and even become insensitive to variations in the inversion properties. Here the efficiency of evaporative cooling at amplifying the <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> is quantified by means of direct numerical simulations of a cloud top mixing layer. We demonstrate that variations in the efficiency modulate the effect of evaporative cooling on entrainment, explaining the different trends. These variations {{are associated with the}} evaporation of droplets in cloud holes below the inversion point. The parametrization of the efficiency provides the evaporative amplification of the <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> as a function of a single parameter that characterizes the inversion.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{sedimentation}} on stratocumulus entrainment is investigated using direct numerical simulations of a cloud-top mixing layer driven by radiative and evaporative cooling. The simulations {{focus on the}} meter and submeter scales {{that are expected to}} be relevant for entrainment, and the finest grid spacing is Δx = 26 cm. The <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> is investigated from the analysis of the integrated-buoyancy evolution equation, which is exactly derived from the flow evolution equations. The analysis shows that sedimentation interacts with entrainment through two different mechanisms. As previously reported, sedimentation prevents droplets from evaporating in the entrainment zone, which in turn reduces the <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity.</b> Here it is shown that sedimentation also promotes a positive buoyancy flux that directly opposes entrainment. The strengths of both mechanisms are characterized by two different settling numbers, which allow for predicting which meteorological conditions favor the reduction of entrainment by sedimentation. These new insights allow for including sedimentation in a parameterization of the <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity.</b> The reduction of the <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> by sedimentation predicted by the parameterization and observed in the simulations is 3 times larger than previously reported in large-eddy simulations, which implies that meter- and submeter-scale turbulence {{plays an important role in}} the interaction of entrainment with sedimentation.

40|$|New {{experimental}} research is presented {{on the characteristics}} of interfaces and internal shear layers that are present in a turbulent boundary layer (TBL). The turbulent/non-turbulent (T/NT) interface at the outer boundary of the TBL shows the presence of a finite jump in streamwise velocity and is characterised by a thin shear layer. It appears that similar layers of high shear occur also within the TBL which separate regions of almost uniform momentum. It turns out that they exhibit similar characteristics as the external T/NT interface. Furthermore, the spatial growth rate of the TBL, that is derived from theoretical analysis, can be correctly predicted from a momentum balance near the external T/NT interface. Similarly, the <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocities</b> for the average internal layers have been determined. Results indicate that internal layers move slower {{in the vicinity of the}} wall, whereas they move faster than the large scale boundary layer growth rate in the outer region of the TBL. It is believed that shear layers bound large scale flow regions of approximately uniform momentum.

40|$|Transition {{in shear}} flows is {{characterized}} by localized turbulent regions embedded in the surrounding laminar flow. These so-called turbulent spots or puffs are observed {{in a variety of}} shear flows and in certain Reynolds-number regimes, and they are advected by the flow while keeping their characteristic length. We show here for the case of pipe flow that this seemingly passive advection of turbulent puffs involves continuous entrainment and relaminarization of laminar and turbulent fluid across strongly convoluted interfaces. Surprisingly, interface areas are almost two orders of magnitude larger than the pipe cross-section, while local <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocities</b> are much smaller than the mean speed. Even though these velocities were shown to be small and proportional to the Kolmogorov velocity scale (in agreement with a prediction by Corrsin) in a flow without mean shear before, we find that, in pipe flow, local <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocities</b> are about an order of magnitude smaller than this scale. The Lagrangian method used to study the dynamics of the laminar–turbulent interfaces allows accurate determination of the leading and trailing edge speeds. However, to resolve the highly complex interface dynamics requires much higher numerical resolutions than for ordinary turbulent flows. This method also reveals that the volume flux across the leading edge has the same radial dependence but the opposite sign as that across the trailing edge, and it is this symmetry that is responsible for the puff shape remaining constant...|$|R

The <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocities</b> into the jets were studied using a particle image velocimetry technique, which resulted in velocity vector maps of the entrainment at a vertical centreline section and at a cross-section. The {{results indicated that the}} cross flow affected the entrainment into the buoyant jet and supported the hypothesis of superposition of the crossflow and <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocities</b> in the irrotational flow region outside the jet. This was incorporated into the analysis of a buoyant jet having Gaussian distributions of excess velocity and buoyancy in a crossflow and resulted in equations showing how, as the crossflow increased, the normal entrainment changed naturally into a forced entrainment formulation, in which the entrainment flux is approximately equal to the projected area of the jet. The theoretical predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results. The mean properties of the advected line thermal were studied using planar laser induced fluorescence. The results compared well to the existing theory and previous research. Turbulence in the ambient was determined to disrupt the flow structure and result in greater dilutions. The experiments revealed the advected thermals as a complex and irregular three dimensional flow characterized by subthermal structures. The unsteady behaviour and the three dimensional structure were studied using statistical studies of the concentration fluctuations and the temporal intermittency of the flow.

All tests were performed under a N 2 purge (R. H. < 1. 0 %) and utilized 52100 steel balls (R(sub a) = 0. 02 mm). Tribometer operations and capacitance-to-film-thickness accuracy were verified by comparing the film thickness approximations to established theoretical predictions for test conditions involving pure rolling. Pure rolling experiments were performed under maximum contact stresses and entrainment velocities of 1. 0 GPa and 1. 0 m/s to 3. 0 m/s, respectively. All data from these baseline tests conformed to theory. ZEV tests were initiated after calibration of the tribometer and verification of film thickness approximation accuracy. Maximum contact stresses up to 0. 57 GPa were supported at zero <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> with sliding speeds from 6. 0 to 10. 0 m/s for sustained amounts of time up to 28. 8 minutes.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{experiment is}} designed to study the interaction at the stratocumulus top between a mean vertical shear and the buoyancy reversal due to evaporative cooling, without radiative cooling. Direct numerical simulation is used to eliminate the uncertainty introduced by turbulence models. It is found that the enhancement by shear-induced mixing of the turbulence caused by buoyancy reversal can render buoyancy reversal comparable to other forcing mechanisms. However, it is also found that (i) the velocity jump across the capping inversion u needs to be relatively large and values of about 1 m s(- 1) that are typically associated with the convective motions inside the boundary layer are generally too small and (ii) {{there is no indication}} of cloud-top entrainment instability. To obtain these results, parameterizations of the mean <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> and the relevant time scales are derived from the study of the cloud-top vertical structure. Two overlapping layers can be identified: a background shear layer with a thickness (1 / 3) (u) (2) /b, where b is the buoyancy increment across the capping inversion and a turbulence layer dominated by free convection inside the cloud and by shear production inside the relatively thin overlap region. As turbulence intensifies, the turbulence layer encroaches into the background shear layer and defines thereby the <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity.</b> Particularized to the first research flight of the Second Dynamics and Chemistry of the Marine Stratocumulus (DYCOMS II) field campaign, the analysis predicts an <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> of about 3 mm s(- 1) after 5 - 10 mina velocity comparable to the measurements and thus indicative of the relevance of mean shear in that case...|$|E

Both the turbulent non-turbulent interface (T/NT) and internal shear layers are detected in snapshots of the stereo-PIV data.

A theoretical approximation of the large scale boundary layer growth indicates that the correct boundary layer growth can be obtained by employing a modified first order jump model on the conditional statistics. Employing the same framework to the internal shear layers indicates that shear layers tend to move slower in close proximity to the wall, whereas they accelerate when moving away from the wall.

The integral model is based on the insights gained from the measurements presented here and other recent experiments, which suggest that the turbulent flow is simply advected and the entrainment is that normal for a jet or plume in a still ambient fluid. General equations for the turbulent flow trajectories are also developed. The predictions of the theory are verified for the no cross-flow case and the cases where the jet or plume is ejected vertically or horizontally into a very small cross-flow. The results of experiments in which a buoyant jet is released {{in the same direction as}} the horizontal ambient flow, show that outside the turbulent region the <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocities</b> can be represented with uniform flow and the appropriate sink.

40|$|We {{report on}} effects of mean shear on the {{turbulent}} entrainment process, focusing in particular on {{their relation to}} small-scale processes in {{the proximity of the}} turbulent/non-turbulent interface (TNTI). Three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry (3 D-PTV) measurements of an axisymmetric jet are compared to data from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a zero-mean-shear (ZMS) flow. First, conditional statistics relative to the interface position are investigated in a pseudo-Eulerian view (i. e. in a fixed frame relative to the interface position) and in a Lagrangian view. We find that in a pseudo-Eulerian frame of reference, both vorticity fluctuations and mean shear contribute to the vorticity jump at the boundary between irrotational and turbulent regions. In contrast, the Lagrangian evolution of enstrophy along trajectories crossing the entrainment interface is almost exclusively dominated by vorticity fluctuations, at least during the first Kolmogorov time scales after passing the interface. A mapping between distance to the instantaneous interface versus conditional time along the trajectory shows that entraining particles remain initially close to the TNTI and therefore attain lower average enstrophy values. The ratio between the rate of change of enstrophy in the two frames of references defines the local <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> v_n = - (Dω^ 2 / D t) / (∂ω^ 2 / ∂x̂_n), where ω^ 2 is enstrophy and x̂_n is the coordinate normal to the TNTI.

Further, the analysis substantiates that for all investigated flow configurations the local <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> depends considerably on the geometrical shape of the interface. Depending on the surface shape, different small-scale mechanisms are dominant for the local entrainment process, i. e. viscous effects for convex shapes and vortex stretching for concave shapes, looking from the turbulent region towards the convoluted boundary.

The results demonstrate the importance of turbulent entrainment and shear {{at the edges of}} the skirt in reducing the concentration of therapeutant within the cage. The effect of cross currents in establishing cellular circulations within the cage is identified as potentially playing a key role in the entrainment process, with the consequential finding that the rate of retention of therapeutant depends upon not only the current speed beneath the cage but also the aspect ratios of the cage and skirt attachment (h/H) respectively. Entrainment of water into the skirt and subsequent reduction in dye concentration increased by a factor of 2 when h/H = 0. 24, compared against h/H = 1. Scaling arguments, together with measured values of <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocities</b> for geometrically-similar flows, are used to estimate typical e-folding retention times of therapeutant within the skirted cage. E-folding retention for an illustrative values of U = 0. 076 m. s- 1 and 0. 003 m. s- 1 the corresponding mean values for T (dye retention time) were 1. 46 h and 37 h respectively. Such time scales are in excess of the current treatment times in the field, albeit subject a number of assumptions that needed to be tested in the field more fully...|$|R

The momentum equations include the turbulent dynamics and the time-dependent and nonlinear terms in both the cross-shelf and alongshelf directions.

40|$|An {{important}} {{process in}} predicting {{the evolution of the}} boundary layer is the entrainment rate, which has received little verification using observed data. The entrainment rate is therefore computed using aircraft measurements obtained off the coast of California during FIRE in 1987. The entrainment zone is defined and determined to be typically less than 10 meters deep. The structure above the boundary layer is found very complex and consists of a layered structure located in the first few hundred meters above the cloud top. These layers are 20 - 130 meters deep and posses properties that relate the layers to boundary layer processes. A conceptual model is presented to explain the formation of these layers. The added presence of the layered structure above the cloud top complicates the determination of jump conditions and thus the calculation of <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity.</b> In addition, jumps in conserved quantities vary considerably between soundings, which questions the validity of using a simple average to calculate the entrainment rate. Therefore, a new method for calculating <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> is presented, which decreases the variation in jump conditions. This method is physically based and yields an entrainment rate with significantly less uncertainty. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{classical}} fluid lubrication {{the film}} thickness is mainly determined by <b>entrainment</b> <b>velocity</b> and oil viscosity. At high pressure, elastic deformation occurs changing the local geometry: {{this is the}} elastohydrodynamic lubrication regime (EHL). When {{a limited amount of}} lubricant is available to the contact, a component failure due to lubricant starvation can result. A new starvation model is presented, using the amount of oil on the surfaces as the key parameter controlling starvation. It is successfully applied to describe the contacts lubricated with multi-phase fluids such as emulsions and greases, which combine starvation with a very complex rheolog...|$|E

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} may be located at [URL] flux measurements of isoprene were performed over the Californian oak belts surrounding the Central Valley. The authors demonstrate {{for the first}} time 1) the feasibility of airborne eddy covariance measurements of reactive biogenic volatile organic compounds; 2) the effect of chemistry on the vertical transport of reactive species, such as isoprene; and 3) the applicability of wavelet analysis to estimate regional fluxes of biogenic volatile organic compounds. These flux measurements demonstrate that instrumentation operating at slower response times (e. g., 1 – 5 s) can still be used to determine eddy covariance fluxes in the mixed layer above land, where typical length scales of 0. 5 – 3 km were observed. Flux divergence of isoprene measured in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is indicative of OH densities in the range of 4 – 7 3 106 molecules per cubic centimeter and allows extrapolation of airborne fluxes to the surface with Damk€ohler numbers (ratio between the mixing time scale and the chemical time scale) in the range of 0. 3 – 0. 9. Most of the isoprene is oxidized in the PBL with entrainment fluxes of about 10 % compared to the corresponding surface fluxes. <b>Entrainment</b> <b>velocities</b> of 1 – 10 cm s 21 were measured. The authors present implications for parameterizing PBL schemes of reactive species in regional and global models...|$|R
