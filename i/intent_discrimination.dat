30|$|In this study, a signal-processing-based technique, called {{template}} matching, {{used for}} detecting {{the presence of}} P 300 evoked potentials with the applications into automated character recognition is proposed. It {{should be noted that}} the use of template matching to detect brain potentials may not be novel and has been addressed before. For example, Kim et al. have proposed a template-matching-based algorithm for spike detection[16]. The method itself has proven that it can quickly and reliably detect action potentials of a variety of morphologies in extracellular neuronal recordings, in comparison with the conventional threshold detection algorithm. Moreover, while visually evoked P 300 response has attracted great attention for the BCI system design, some previous works focused on the use of a so-called m-sequence to induce/evoke responses in the visual cortex. In this aspect, Nezamfar et al. used multiple m-sequences for <b>intent</b> <b>discrimination</b> in the brain interface, instead of using a single m-sequence and its shifted versions previously[17]. They employed a correlation coefficient-based template matching scheme to define the classifier. On the other hand, in addition to the brain potential detection, template matching has also been successfully applied to a variety of topics in biomedical signal processing area, such as the ECG component detection (e.g., QRS detection[18]).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Intent</b> and <b>discrimination</b> may {{determine}} both pro- and anti-social behavior. Infants may act in seemingly anti-social ways and yet be generally accepted as {{too young to}} know the difference before the age of 4 or 5. Berger states that parents should teach their children that [...] "emotions need to be regulated, not depressed". Studies have shown that in children between ages 13-14 who bully or show aggressive behavior towards others exhibits anti-social behaviors in their early adulthood. There are strong statistical relationships that shows this significant association between childhood aggressiveness and anti-social behaviors. Analyses saw that 20% of these children who exhibit anti-social behaviors at later ages had court appearances and police contact {{as a result of their}} behavior.|$|R

5000|$|Title IX {{would affect}} men's {{athletics}} and prompted some concern {{to look for}} ways to limit the influence of Title IX. Senator Bayh spent the next three years keeping watch over HEW to get regulations formulated that carried out its legislative <b>intent</b> of eliminating <b>discrimination</b> in higher education on the basis of sex. When they were issued in summer 1975 they were contested, and hearings were held by the House Subcommittee on Equal Opportunities on the discrepancies between the regulations and the law. In 1974, Senator John Tower introduced the Tower Amendment, which would have exempted revenue-producing sports from Title IX compliance. Later that year, the Tower Amendment was rejected and the Javits Amendment, proposed by Senator Jacob Javits, stating that the HEW must include [...] "reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports" [...] was adopted in its place.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{complaints}} {{about the use of}} migrant workers, the Act does not require that contractors show that workers engaged are local residents, but rather requires that laborers be paid the local prevailing wage. Due to the way the data were collected at that time and {{due to the fact that}} construction trades were heavily unionized at that time by craft unions, “prevailing wage” effectively meant “union journeyman wage” as discussed above. Unions operate by negotiating for higher wages, and then working to restrict those eligible for the higher wages to union membership. Craft unions did not admit black apprentices, and therefore black laborers did not have the opportunity to advance to journeyman status. According to Bernstein, “as of 1940 blacks composed 19 percent of the 435,000 unskilled [...] "construction laborers" [...] in the United States and 45 percent of the 87,060 in the South”, and according to Hill, [...] "the increase of Negro participation in building trades apprenticeship training programs rose only from 1.5% to 2%" [...] in New York between 1950 and 1960. Furthermore, Hill pointed out that [...] "ecause the National Labor Relations Board has done little to enforce the anti-closed shop provisions of the Taft Hartley Act, building trades unions affiliated to the AFL-CIO in most instances are closed unions operating closed shops". Therefore, the requirements and mechanisms of the Davis–Bacon Act necessarily prevented black laborers from participating in federally funded construction projects. “According to a study on youth and minority employment published by the Congressional Joint Economic Committee on July 6, 1977, Davis–Bacon wage requirements discourage nonunion contractors from bidding on Federal construction work, thus harming minority and young workers who are more likely to work in the nonunionized sector of the construction industry.” Thus, even if racism was not the <b>intent,</b> racial <b>discrimination</b> was a result of the law.|$|R
40|$|American {{disability}} discrimination laws contain few intent requirements. Yet courts frequently demand showings of <b>intent</b> in disability <b>discrimination</b> lawsuits. <b>Intent</b> requirements arose {{almost by}} accident: through a false statutory analogy; by repetition of obsolete judicial language; and by doctrine developed {{to avoid a}} nonexistent conflict with another law. Demanding that section 504 and Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claimants show intent imposes a burden not found in those statutes or their interpretive regulations. This Article provides reasons not to impose intent requirements for liability or monetary relief in section 504 and ADA cases concerning reasonable accommodations. It demonstrates that no intent requirement applies to ADA employment cases, then explains that the same conclusion should apply to cases under the ADA’s {{state and local government}} provisions and section 504. It rebuts an analogy to caselaw under Title VI and Title IX of the Civil Rights Act that some courts use to impose intent requirements. It then discusses the reasoning of cases relying on the inappropriate analogy, cases resting on obsolete precedent, and cases refusing to apply remedies to avoid conflicting with federal law. This Article relies on a contextual reading of Supreme Court decisions, the history of the ADA, and policy considerations...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesStigma towards {{people living}} with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is strong in Malaysia. Although stigma has been understudied, {{it may be a}} barrier to {{treating}} the approximately 81000 Malaysian PLWHA. The current study explores correlates of intentions to discriminate against PLWHA among medical and dental students, the future healthcare providers of Malaysia. MethodsAn online, cross-sectional survey of 1296 medical and dental students was conducted in 2012 at seven Malaysian universities; 1165 (89. 9 %) completed the survey and were analysed. Socio-demographic characteristics, stigma-related constructs and intentions to discriminate against PLWHA were measured. Linear mixed models were conducted, controlling for clustering by university. ResultsThe final multivariate model demonstrated that students who intended to discriminate more against PLWHA were female, less advanced in their training, and studying dentistry. They further endorsed more negative attitudes towards PLWHA, internalised greater HIV-related shame, reported more HIV-related fear and disagreed more strongly that PLWHA deserve good care. The final model accounted for 38 % of the variance in <b>discrimination</b> <b>intent,</b> with 10 % accounted for by socio-demographic characteristics and 28 % accounted for by stigma-related constructs. ConclusionsIt is critical to reduce stigma among medical and dental students to eliminate intentions to discriminate and achieve equitable care for Malaysian PLWHA. Stigma-reduction interventions should be multipronged, addressing attitudes, internalised shame, fear and perceptions of deservingness of care...|$|R
