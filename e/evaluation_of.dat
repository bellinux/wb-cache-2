40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{structure}} of subjective well-being is analyzed by multidimensional mapping <b>of</b> <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> life concerns. For example, one finds that <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> Income {{are close to}} (i. e., relatively strongly related to) <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> Standard of living, but remote from (weakly related to) <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> Health. These structures show how <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> life components fit together and hence illuminate the psychological meaning of life quality. They can be useful for determining the breadth of coverage and degree of redundancy of social indicators of perceived well-being. Analyzed here ar...|$|R

40|$|Cultures {{differ in}} many {{important}} ways, but one trait {{appears to be}} universally valued: prosociality. For one’s reputation, around the world, it pays {{to be nice to}} others. However, recent research with American participants finds that <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> prosocial actions are asymmetric—relatively selfish actions are evaluated according to the magnitude <b>of</b> selfishness but <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> relatively generous actions are less sensitive to magnitude. Extremely generous actions are judged roughly as positively as modestly generous actions, but extremely selfish actions are judged much more negatively than modestly selfish actions (Klein & Epley, 2014). Here we test whether this asymmetry in <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> prosociality is culture-specific. Across 7 countries, 1, 240 participants evaluated actors giving various amounts of money to a stranger. Along with relatively minor cross-cultural differences in <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> generous actions, we find cross-cultural similarities in the asymmetry in <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> prosociality.

40|$|<b>Evaluations</b> <b>of</b> {{political}} leaders {{have long been}} considered {{an important component of}} the vote decision. Nevertheless, little research has been conducted in Canada on voters’ overall <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> their {{political leaders}}. Indeed, the topic has only recently received much systematic attention in the comparative literature. The study of how voters’ judgements about the personality characteristics of candidates affect their overall <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> those candidates is an area that has been particularly neglected. In this thesis, we test three hypotheses about the impact of personality trait attributions on voters’ overall <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> Canadian federal party leaders. The data for our analyses are drawn from the 1974, 1979 and 1984 Canadian National Election Studies. The first hypothesis is that there is a relationship between trait attributions and voters’ overall <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> Canadian political leaders that is independent of such factors as party identification, issue positions, and other impressions of the parties and leaders. This hypothesis is supported. The second hypothesis is that trait attributions will have an impact on voters’ overall <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> Liberal and PC leaders second in importance to party identification, and that trait attributions will be second in importance to issue positions with regard to <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> NDP leaders. This hypothesis is only partially supported. For Liberal and PC leaders, the impact of party identification on evaluation is generally surpassed by the impact of positive trait attributions. With regard to <b>evaluations</b> <b>of</b> NDP leaders, the impact of issue positions is generally surpassed by the impact of party identification, positive trait attributions and negative trait attributions. The third hypothesis is that attributions of competence and integrity will have a greater impact on overall <b>evaluation</b> than attributions <b>of</b> other personality traits. This hypothesis is also only partially supported. The impact of integrity is considerably less than has been found to be the case by other researchers...|$|R
