40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a general {{dimensionality}} reduction method for data generated {{from a very}} broad family of distributions and nonlinear functions based on the generalized linear model, called Generalized Linear Principal Component Analysis (GLPCA). Data of different domains often have very different structures. These data can be modeled by different distributions and reconstruction functions. For example, real valued data can be modeled by the Gaussian distribution with a linear reconstruction function, whereas binary valued data may be more appropriately modeled by the Bernoulli distribution with a logit or probit function. Based on general linear models, we propose a unified framework for extracting features from data of different domains. A general optimization algorithm based on natural gradient ascent on <b>distribution</b> <b>manifold</b> is proposed for obtaining the maximum likelihood solutions. We also present some specific algorithms derived from this framework to deal with specific data modeling problems such as document modeling. Experimental results of these algorithms on several data sets are shown for the validation of GLPCA. ...|$|E
40|$|A logic-based {{systematic}} {{method of}} designing manifold systems to achieve flowrate uniformity among the channels that interconnect a <b>distribution</b> <b>manifold</b> {{and a collection}} manifold has been developed, implemented, and illustrated by case studies. The method is based on tailoring the flow resistance of the individual channels to achieve equal pressure drops for all the channels. The tailoring of the flow resistance is accomplished {{by the use of}} gate-valve-like obstructions. The adjustment of the valve-like obstructions is determined here by means of numerical simulations. Although the method is iterative, it may converge in one cycle of the iterations. Progress toward the goal of per-channel uniformity can be accelerated by tuning a multiplicative constant. The only departure of the method from being fully automatic is the selection of the aforementioned multiplicative constant. The method is described in detail in a step-by-step manner. These steps are illustrated both generically and specifically for four case studies. As an example, in one of the case studies, an original flow imbalance of over 100 % in an untailored manifold system was reduced to a flow imbalance of less than 10 % in one cycle of the method...|$|E

40|$|Effective and {{efficient}} spatial normalization {{of a large}} population of brain images is critical for many clinical and research studies, but it is technically very challenging. A commonly used approach is to choose a certain image as the template and then align all other images in the population to this template by applying pairwise registration. To avoid the potential bias induced by the inappropriate template selection, groupwise registration methods have been proposed to simultaneously register all images to a latent common space. However, current groupwise registration methods do not make full use of image distribution information for more accurate registration. In this paper, we present a novel groupwise registration method that harnesses the image distribution information by capturing the image <b>distribution</b> <b>manifold</b> using a hierarchical graph with its nodes representing the individual images. More specifically, a low-level graph describes the image distribution in each subgroup, and a high-level graph encodes the relationship between representative images of subgroups. Given the graph representation, we can register all images to the common space by dynamically shrinking the graph on the image manifold. The topology of the entire image distribution is always maintained during graph shrinkage. Evaluations on two datasets, one for 80 elderly individuals and one for 285 infants, indicate that our method can yield promising results...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the nonholonomic Lagrangian setting of {{mechanical}} systems in local coordinates on finite-dimensional configuration manifolds. We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions by reducing the basic equations of motion {{to a set of}} ordinary differential equations on the underlying <b>distribution</b> <b>manifold</b> $D$. Moreover, we show that any $D-$preserving discretization may be understood as beeing generated by the exact evolution map of a time-periodic non-autonomous perturbation of the original continuous-time nonholonomic system. By means of discretizing the corresponding Lagrange-d'Alembert principle, we construct geometric integrators for the original nonholonomic system. We give precise conditions under which these integrators generate a discrete flow preserving the distribution $D$. Also, we derive corresponding consistency estimates. Finally, we carefully treat the example of the nonholonomic particle, showing how to discretize the equations of motion in a reasonable way, particularly regarding the nonholonomic constraints. The exploration in this paper lays the ground to analyze the dynamics of appropriate discretizations of nonholonomic mechnical systems in the Lagrangian framework and to relate that dynamics to the dynamics of the original nonholonomic systems. We postpone this analysis to a series of forthcoming papers.

To calculate the Solov'ev sectional and Ricci curvatures for homogeneous sub-Riemannian manifolds, the author suggests to use in some cases special riggings of invariant completely non- holonomic <b>distributions</b> on <b>manifolds.</b> As a justification, we find a foliation on the cotangent bundle over a Lie group G whose leaves are tangent to invariant Hamiltonian vector fields for the Pontryagin-Hamilton func- tion. This function was applied in the Pontryagin maximum principle for the time-optimal problem. The foliation is entirely described by the co-adjoint representation of the Lie group G. Also we use the canonical symplectic form and its values for the above mentioned invari- ant Hamiltonian vector fields. In particular, the above rigging method is applicable to contact sub-Riemannian manifolds, sub-Riemannian Carnot groups, and homogeneous sub-Riemannian manifolds possessing a subme- try onto a Riemannian manifold.

One way to improve uniformity in NH 3 applicators is the use of a better <b>distribution</b> <b>manifold.</b> Impellicone and pulse-width-modulated (PWM) manifolds are newer design alternatives to a Vertical-Dam manifold. Uniformity measurements during field application were made comparing Vertical-Dam manifolds with several Impellicone manifold designs and also a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) valve design as these manifolds were refined for commercial production. Application rates ranged from 23. 7 to 224 kg N/ha (21. 2 to 200 lb N/acre) depending on experiment with many applications near 84 kg N/ha (75 lb N/acre; “low” rate) and 168 kg N/ha (150 lb N/acre; “high” rate) during Impellicone tests.

Modified Impellicone manifolds had average coefficients of variation (CVs) 9 and 6 percentage points lower, than the Vertical-Dam manifold at the low rate and high application rates, respectively.

40|$|Abstract—Conventional linear {{subspace}} learning methods like {{principal component}} analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) derive subspaces from the whole data set. These approaches have limitations {{in the sense that}} they are linear while the data dis-tribution we are trying to model is typically nonlinear. Moreover, these algorithms fail to incorporate local variations of the intrinsic sample <b>distribution</b> <b>manifold.</b> Therefore, these algorithms are ineffective when applied on large scale datasets. Kernel versions of these approaches can alleviate the problem to certain degree but face a serious computational challenge when data set is large, where the computing involves Eigen/QP problems of size NN. When N is large, kernel versions are not computationally practical. To tackle the aforementioned problems and improve recognition/searching performance, especially on large scale image datasets, we propose a novel local subspace indexing model for image search termed Subspace Indexing Model on Grassmann Manifold (SIM-GM). SIM-GM partitions the global space into local patches with a hi-erarchical structure; the global model is, therefore, approximated by piece-wise linear local subspace models. By further applying the Grassmann manifold distance, SIM-GM is able to organize local-ized models into a hierarchy of indexed structure, and allow fast query selection of the optimal ones for classification. Our proposed SIM-GM enjoys a number of merits: 1) it is able to deal with a large number of training samples efficiently; 2) it is a query-driven approach, i. e., it is able to return an effective local space model, so the recognition performance could be significantly improved; 3) it is a common framework, which can incorporate many learning al-gorithms. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results confirm the validity of this model.
