5|$|The {{design of}} the medal is modeled after one used for the <b>Hero</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. Unlike the <b>Hero</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, Hero of Socialist Labor and the <b>Hero</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian Federation titles, there is no {{engraving}} on the reverse of the star. The ribbon also copies the Soviet Hero medal's ribbon, since a flag design was also {{used to make the}} ribbon of that medal. The medal is always worn in full {{on the left side of}} the breast above all other medals and orders. Chapter 4, Article 69 of Law N 288-З states that any awards and titles presented by the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR must be placed after awards from the Republic of Belarus.|$|E

5|$|At {{his death}} in 1799 he left a {{critical}} legacy; he exemplified the core ideals of the American Revolution and the new nation: republican virtue and devotion to civic duty. Washington was the unchallenged public icon of American military and civic patriotism. He was also identified with the Federalist Party, which {{lost control of the}} national government in 1800 to the Jeffersonian Republicans, who were reluctant to celebrate the <b>hero</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opposition party.|$|E
5|$|At the Battle of Kursk, Novikov {{introduced}} new innovations such as shaped-charge bombs, night {{fighters and}} ground-attack aircraft. The Battle of Königsberg saw 2,500 combat aircraft under Novikov being {{made available to}} the besieging armies, with the Soviet air marshal recommending low level heavy night bombers being used. 514 of these dropped 4,440 tons of bombs on the beleaguered city. For his part in the operation Novikov was made <b>Hero</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, and on June 24, 1944 the United States awarded him a Legion of Merit. Novikov then transferred to the Pacific Theatre to fight against Japan, where he was made <b>Hero</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union a second time for his work in forming large air armies to bomb Japanese forces in China and Korea.|$|E

Conversely, he has been derided as a dictator responsible for economic mismanagement, widespread corruption, anti-white racial discrimination, human rights abuses, suppression of political critics and crimes against humanity.|$|E

5|$|The idea {{of using}} {{anthropomorphic}} furry animals as protagonists in a story set in the American West pre-dated Popol Out West by several years. In December 1931, Hergé produced Tim-L'Ésureuil, Héros du Far-West ("Tim the Squirrel, <b>Hero</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Far West") for L'Innovation, a large department store in Brussels.

5|$|A map of Vilnius {{published}} in 1942, while {{the city was}} under Nazi rule, shows {{the northern part of}} Žirmūnai as Paneriškės, the middle section as Kareiviškės ("place of soldiers") and the southern part, close to the Tuskulėnai Manor, as Mantiškės ("a place named in honour of Mantas"). One of the streets in the area, Enriko Manto Street, referred to Herkus Mantas (Herkus Monte), a <b>hero</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Prussian Uprising; today H.

5|$|Boone's adventures, {{real and}} mythical, {{formed the basis}} of the archetypal <b>hero</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American West, popular in 19th-century novels and 20th-century films. The main {{character}} of James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales, the first of which was published in 1823, bore striking similarities to Boone; even his name, Nathaniel Bumppo, echoed Daniel Boone's name. As mentioned above, The Last of the Mohicans (1826), Cooper's second Leatherstocking novel, featured a fictionalized version of Boone's rescue of his daughter. After Cooper, other writers developed the Western hero, an iconic figure which began as a variation of Daniel Boone.|$|E

5|$|In April 1991 Vladimir Bukovsky visited Moscow for {{the first}} time since his {{deportation}} fifteen years before. In the run-up to the 1991 presidential election Boris Yeltsin's campaign team included Bukovsky on their list of potential vice-presidential running-mates. In the end, army officer Alexander Rutskoy, a veteran of the 1979–1989 war in Afghanistan and <b>Hero</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union was selected. On 5 December 1991 both of Bukovsky's Soviet-era convictions were annulled by a decree of the RSFSR Supreme Court. The following year President Yeltsin formally restored Bukovsky's Russian citizenship: he had never been deprived of his Soviet citizenship, despite deportation from the country.|$|E
5|$|In January 2114, 42 {{years after}} the Citadel events and 12 years into {{rebuilding}} TriOptimum, the company created an experimental FTL starship, the Von Braun, which is now on its maiden voyage. The ship is also followed by a UNN space vessel, the Rickenbacker, which is controlled by Captain William Bedford Diego, son of Edward Diego, the Citadel Station's infamous commander and public <b>hero</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Boston Harbor during the Eastern States Police Action. Because the Rickenbacker {{does not have an}} FTL system of its own, the two ships are attached for the trip. However, Korenchkin was egotistical enough to make himself the captain of the Von Braun despite being inexperienced.|$|E
5|$|In March 1825, Lafayette {{began to}} tour the {{southern}} and western states.

There would be special events, visits to battlefields and historic sites, celebratory dinners, and time set aside for the public to meet the legendary <b>hero</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Revolution.|$|E
