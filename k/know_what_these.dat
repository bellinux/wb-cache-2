5|$|Scientists {{do not yet}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>these</b> dinosaurs ate. Having very small, ridged teeth {{they could}} not have chewed tough, fibrous plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period. It is assumed that pachycephalosaurs lived on a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, and fruits. The sharp, serrated teeth would have been very effective for shredding plants.|$|E
25|$|Astrology (the {{operation}} of the stars): Hermes claims that Zoroaster discovered {{this part of the}} wisdom of the whole universe, astrology, and taught it to man. In Hermetic thought, {{it is likely that the}} movements of the planets have meaning beyond the laws of physics and actually hold metaphorical value as symbols in the mind of The All, or God. Astrology has influences upon the Earth, but does not dictate our actions, and wisdom is gained when we <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>these</b> influences are and how to deal with them.|$|E
25|$|I {{would be}} a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people {{of the public and}} we have found you wanting. The old Inquisition had its rack and its {{thumbscrews}} and its instruments of torture with iron teeth. We <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>these</b> things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the thumbscrews are the high-powered and swift machinery close to which we must work, and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{references}} to [...] "Paraiya chieftainships" [...] in the 8th and 10th centuries, {{but it is}} not <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>these</b> were and how they were integrated into the Chola political system.|$|R

60|$|He <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>these</b> cheers were worth, {{and that}} even Fitzjocelyn might not long be the popular hero; {{but he was not}} the less gratified and triumphant, and felt that no success of his whole life had been worth the present.|$|R
25|$|Like other Slavs, the Great Moravian Slavs {{originally}} practised polytheistic religion {{with the}} cult of ancestors. Several cult places used prior the Christianization of Moravia are known from Moravia (Mikulčice and Pohansko). However, we do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>these</b> objects, such as a ring ditch with a fire, a horse sacrifice, or human limbs ritually buried in a cemetery, meant for Great Moravians. An alleged cult object in Mikulčice was reportedly used until the evangelization of the Moravian elite in the mid-9th century and idols in Pohansko were raised {{on the site of}} a demolished church during the pagan backlash in the 10th century. The only one Slavic pagan shrine known from today's Slovakia is an object in Most in Bratislave dedicated probably to the god of war and thunder Perun. The shrine was abandoned in the mid-9th century and never restored.|$|E
500|$|Though {{naturally}} left-handed, Gallagher plays guitar right-handed, {{which he}} claims {{is the only}} thing he can do with his non-dominant hand. Gallagher has said he sometimes does not understand his own lyrics, commenting in 2005 that [...] "when I'm halfway through 'Don't Look Back in Anger' I say to myself. 'I still don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>these</b> words mean!'" [...] Gallagher has declared to be dyslexic, which slows down the process of his songwriting, nor can he read or write music.|$|E
500|$|Ó Corrain {{also offers}} {{argument}} against the identification of Ímar and Ingvar/Ivar: [...] "To take but one example, if Ivarr of Dublin is identical with Inguar, {{how are we to}} give any credence to Smyth's reconstruction of Brompton (p. 229) which shows Ivarr in East Anglia in 871 when we know from contemporary Irish sources that Ivarr of Dublin was besieging Dumbarton for four months in 870 and returned to Ireland in early 871 with the takings?... Taken all together, the genuine material on Inguar in contemporary English sources is slight". He also states [...] "there is nothing new in the suggestion that Ímar of Dublin and Igwar/Ingwar/Iuuar of English history are identical. It has frequently been put forward....and has equally frequently been rejected or treated as a mere possibility". Downham concludes [...] "while medieval writers seem to have been as interested as modern historians about Ívarr’s origins, it is perhaps wiser to accept that we do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>these</b> really were".|$|E

2500|$|In December 2012, in an {{interview}} with Rap-Up, T.I. shared details about his collaboration with singer-songwriter Pink on the T-Minus-produced [...] "Guns and Roses," [...] which he describes as a [...] "bittersweet romantic story." [...] "We found that we had a few things in common," [...] says T.I. of the pop-rocker. [...] "We clicked. She real people, she from the streets. I’m a real cat, I’m from the streets. We found ourselves in rooms where we were like, ‘You <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> <b>These</b> people fake as hell in here. Let’s get out of here.’" [...] In a listening session at NYC's Germano Studios, where T.I. played ten songs from the album for industry tastemakers and label executives, he stated he had big hopes for the song.|$|E
2500|$|In {{one of two}} {{instances}} {{throughout the}} trial when prosecutor Stephen Kay was reduced to tears, {{he walked out of}} the courtroom during the recess following the hearing of the recording of Shirley Ledford's rape, abuse and torture. Weeping openly, Kay stated to the reporters gathered outside the courtroom: [...] "Everybody who has heard that tape has had it affect their lives. I just picture those girls... how alone they were when they died." [...] When questioned by reporters as to whether the audio tape should have been introduced into evidence, given the obvious psychological and emotional trauma caused to many in the courtroom through the contents being broadcast, Kay simply stated: [...] "You're darn right it [...] should have been. The jury needs to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>these</b> guys did." ...|$|E
60|$|Monday passed, and Ciccio did not come: Tuesday passed: and Wednesday. In {{her soul}} she was sceptical of their keeping their promise--either Madame or Ciccio.

6000|$|This {{reflection}} {{reminded me}} that she had promised us a further exhibition of those powers and within an hour or two. Remembering this I began to regret that I had ever asked for any such manifestations, for who <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>these</b> might or might not involve? ...|$|R

60|$|For {{some weeks}} past, the master had again begun {{to spend the}} whole {{of his time in}} the mysterious laboratory.

50|$|There {{have been}} some recent rumblings between {{the city and the}} Emerald Enclave. While Reth {{eventually}} decided to back down from its harvesting of trees from the Nunwood, the Enclave has retained an open presence within the city. The little tree harvesting the city has done lately has been complicated by reports of monsters in the Nunwood. No one <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>these</b> creatures are. They attack under cover of darkness and cause great confusion before retreating into the forest. The Emerald Enclave has remained silent, but many suspect they’re behind the recent altercations.|$|R
