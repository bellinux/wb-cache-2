5|$|Birmingham's {{explosive}} <b>industrial</b> <b>expansion</b> started {{earlier than}} that of the textile-manufacturing towns of the North of England, and was driven by different factors. Instead of the economies of scale of a low-paid, unskilled workforce producing a single bulk commodity such as cotton or wool in large, mechanised units of production, Birmingham's industrial development was built on the adaptability and creativity of a highly paid workforce with a strong division of labour, practising a broad variety of skilled specialist trades and producing a constantly diversifying range of products, in a highly entrepreneurial economy of small, often self-owned workshops. This led to exceptional levels of inventiveness: between 1760 and 1850 – the core years of the Industrial Revolution – Birmingham residents registered over three times as many patents as those of any other British town or city.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{sought to}} erect a new {{building}} to address the increasingly cramped conditions of the original Boylston Street campus located near Copley Square, in the increasingly fashionable and crowded Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. Because the stipulations of the original land grant prevented MIT from covering more than two-ninths of its current lot, Walker announced his intention to build the <b>industrial</b> <b>expansion</b> on a lot directly across from the Trinity Church fully intending that expected opposition would lead to favorable terms for selling the proposed land and funding construction elsewhere. With the financial health of the Institute only beginning to recover, Walker began construction on the partially-funded expansion, fully expecting the immediacy of the project to be a persuasive tool for raising its funds. The strategy was only partially successful, as the 1883 building had laboratory facilities that were second-to-none but also lacked the outward architectural grandeur of its sister building and was generally considered an eyesore on its surroundings. Mechanical shops were {{moved out of the}} original Rogers Building in the mid-1880s to accommodate other programs, and in 1892 the Institute began construction on another Copley Square building.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{completion}} of the Chita-Khabarovsk highway, the Transbaikalia was a dead end for automobile transport. While this recently constructed through road will at first benefit mostly the transit travel to and from the Pacific provinces, it will also boost settlement and <b>industrial</b> <b>expansion</b> in the scarsely populated regions of Zabaykalsky Krai and Amur Oblast.|$|E
2500|$|In 1916, after Europe {{had entered}} the Great War (World War I), a {{shipyard}} was constructed on the Saint Louis River. A new workers neighborhood, today known as Riverside, developed around the large operation. Similar <b>industrial</b> <b>expansions</b> {{took place during the}} Second World War, as Duluth's large harbor and the area's vast natural resources were put to work for the war effort. Tankers and submarine chasers (usually called [...] "sub-chasers") were built at the Riverside shipyard. The population of Duluth continued to grow in the postwar decade and a half, peaking at 107,884 in 1960.|$|R

50|$|In 1837, the Dakota ceded {{their lands}} {{east of the}} Mississippi River (35 million acres) after the early American {{expansion}} of the 1830s. Fourteen years later, the Mdewakanton Dakota ceded their lands west of the river for reservations up to the Minnesota River. After the Dakota were forced to leave, European immigrants took over the land and cultivated it, leading to <b>industrial</b> <b>expansions.</b> The North Star Brewery was built into the bluff in 1853 and later became Jacob Schmidt's first brewery. In the 1880s the land was claimed for industrial use, resulting in the expansion of railroads {{and the destruction of}} the Wakan Tipi petroglyphs.|$|R
25|$|After the war, a large oil {{refinery}} {{was built in}} Gela's territory, {{as a part of}} Eni's <b>industrial</b> <b>expansion</b> plan in South Italy. This was to help the economy of the region, but instead it caused significant damage to the area's visual appearance and touristic appeal. In 2014 the refinery closed down.|$|E

The eight models produced at the state's auto factories totaled combined sales of 74,335 vehicles for 2012. The strongest model sales during this period were the Hyundai Elantra compact car, the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class sport utility vehicle and the Honda Ridgeline sport utility truck.|$|E
25|$|In 1871, {{the railway}} came to Szepes {{and this was}} to have {{profound}} consequences. On the one hand, it enabled economic and <b>industrial</b> <b>expansion.</b> On the other, it bypassed the old capital of the region, Lőcse (now Levoča), and favoured the growth of centres on its route, such as Poprád (now Poprad) and Igló (now Spišská Nová Ves).|$|E

25|$|From {{the second}} half of the 19th century up to around 1920, Argentina {{experienced}} rapid economic growth and <b>industrial</b> <b>expansion,</b> becoming a world economic power. Foreign capital was the driving force for this development, with 92% of the workshops and factories in 1887 being owned by non-Argentines, according to a census. Similarly, most of the workers in this period were immigrants; 84% according to the same census.|$|E
25|$|The North's most {{important}} war measure {{was perhaps the}} creation of a system of national banks that provided a sound currency for the <b>industrial</b> <b>expansion.</b> Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately turned that money over to the Treasury for war needs.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cement {{forms the}} {{cornerstone}} of the construction sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Despite its relatively low price, cement constitutes {{a significant portion of the}} costs of constructing any building. Therefore, any increase in cement selling prices has a considerable effect on a project’s costs and profitability. The construction and building materials sector usually follows the growth in a country’s GDP, with the main drivers of demand being real estate, tourism and infrastructure projects. <b>Industrial</b> <b>expansions</b> also have an effect on the demand for cement. During expansionary periods, demand for building materials (including cement) tend to surge at a higher rate than GDP growth, while an economic slowdown severely affects demand for building materials. This paper provides insight into the cement and construction industries of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It covers a period of several years with respect to cement production and consumption. Various trends are highlighted, and a forecast for the general sector development in coming years is presented. 1...|$|R
50|$|On September 30, 1899 Preston was {{incorporated}} as {{a town with}} a population of just under 11,000. The Great Road between Dundas and Berlin (Kitchener) as well as the railroad connections helped the community to continue growing into an important industrial centre. Products made here included flour, agricultural implements, furniture, stoves, shoes and textiles. Preston grew and continued to be a successful <b>industrial</b> area; <b>expansion</b> followed in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R
25|$|The South American {{cane toad}} was {{introduced}} to sugar cane fields {{to the south of}} Cairns in early 1935 to assist in the control of the cane beetle. The toxic animal developed into one of the worst feral pests in Australia's history, resulting in ecological disaster to many native species. In November of the same year, the Barron Falls Hydro Electricity scheme began to provide power for an era of major <b>industrial</b> <b>expansion.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Great Depression {{slowed the}} pace of <b>industrial</b> <b>expansion.</b> In 1930, a Lima {{directory}} listed 93 industrial employers with some 8,000 employees. By 1934, industrial employment was reduced by half. In 1935, Westinghouse located a Small Motor Division in Lima to build fractional horsepower electric motors. The Ohio Steel Foundry turned the corner and grew, eventually expanding its successes in its industry. The thirties were a decade for organizing labor in Lima. By 1940 {{there were at least}} fifty labor unions representing local workers.|$|E

Giolitti’s prominent role in the years {{from the start of}} the 20th century until 1914 is known as the Giolittian Era, in which Italy experienced an <b>industrial</b> <b>expansion,</b> the rise of organised labour and the emergence of an active Catholic political movement.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} the coastal regional trends in urbanization processes using {{remotely sensed images}} around the Kucukcekmece Lagoon as a case study, located {{in the western part}} of Istanbul, Turkey. Throughout the examination process, the coastline changes are determined for a long-term period. To achieve this goal, post-classification comparison method is applied to the CORONA and LANDSAT TM satellite images of 1963, 1987 and 2005. In order to identify the land use changes, common landscape structures in the region were distinguished as water, green and open land, urban and industrial areas. Due to the mix up of land-cover types between urban and industrial areas, the classified images are integrated with geographic information system data obtained from visual interpretation of the enhanced images and auxiliary data sets. The results of the change analyses in coastal region showed that important alterations are taking place in the area due to the unplanned urban and <b>industrial</b> <b>expansions</b> that has irreversibly changed the physical features of the Kucukcekmece Lagoon. According to image classification results, th...|$|R

25|$|Northumberland {{played a}} key role in the Industrial Revolution from the 18th century on. Many coal mines {{operated}} in Northumberland until the widespread closures in the 1970s and 1980s. Collieries operated at Ashington, Bedlington, Blyth, Choppington, Netherton, Ellington and Pegswood. The region's coalfields fuelled <b>industrial</b> <b>expansion</b> in other areas of Britain, and the need to transport the coal from the collieries to the Tyne led to the development of the first railways. Shipbuilding and armaments manufacture were other important industries before the deindustrialisation of the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>expansion</b> {{began in}} earnest {{following}} the 1933–37 construction of the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River. Hydroelectric power, food, and lumber provided by Oregon helped fuel {{the development of the}} West, although the periodic fluctuations in the U.S. building industry have hurt the state's economy on multiple occasions. Portland in particular experienced a population boom between 1900 and 1930, tripling in size; the arrival of World War II also provided the northwest region of the state with an industrial boom, where Liberty ships and aircraft carriers were constructed.|$|E
25|$|Major {{railroad}} infrastructure, {{known as}} the Milwaukee Junction, {{was built in the}} 1890s to facilitate <b>industrial</b> <b>expansion</b> in the city of Detroit.

25|$|The American Dream is {{the belief}} that through hard work and determination, any United States {{immigrant}} can achieve a better life, usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal freedom of choice. According to historians, the rapid economic and <b>industrial</b> <b>expansion</b> of the U.S. is not simply a function of being a resource rich, hard working, and inventive country, but the belief that anybody could get a share of the country's wealth if he or she was willing to work hard. This dream has been a major factor in attracting immigrants to the United States.|$|E
25|$|The Iron {{industry}} in Scunthorpe {{was established in}} the mid 10th century, following the discovery and exploitation of middle Lias ironstone east of Scunthorpe. Initially iron ore was exported to iron producers in South Yorkshire. Later, after the construction of the Trent, Ancholme and Grimsby Railway (1860s) gave rail access to the area iron production in the area rapidly expanded using local ironstone and imported coal or coke. Rapid <b>industrial</b> <b>expansion</b> in the area led directly {{to the development of the}} town of Scunthorpe, eventually incorporating several other former hamlets and villages, located in a formerly sparsely populated entirely agricultural area.|$|E

50|$|During the heyday, {{people had}} {{established}} {{trade relations with}} Ceylon. The British East India Company had started its <b>industrial</b> <b>expansions</b> in Malaya and turning Singapore into a flourishing free port by the dawn of 19th century {{and there was a}} big flow of human resources from China and India to these areas. That might have been a possible reason for Puthenthopians’ first journey out from his secluded land. Malaya and Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1941 and the Puthenthopinas who joined INA might have been those who were already in Singapore, rather than they going out from Puthenthope to join INA (INA was supported by Japan - it was not easy to join INA in British India and British Singapore). It was during the Second World War that our people joined British army as koolipattalam.The traveling of Puthenthopians {{to other parts of the}} world was purely on job hunt rather than any other social inevitability. Many people from Puthenthope have traveled to Malaysia and Singapore before and after the Second World War. It might have been from there that some Puthenthopians moved on to England, after the independence of these countries in 1957. British must have allowed some of their civil servants to accompany them on their withdrawal (a possible reason).|$|R
