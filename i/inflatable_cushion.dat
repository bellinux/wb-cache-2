50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{materials of}} modern tires are synthetic rubber, natural rubber, fabric and wire, {{along with other}} compound chemicals. They consist of a tread and a body. The tread provides traction while the body ensures support. Before rubber was invented, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal that fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear. Today, {{the vast majority of}} tires are pneumatic inflatable structures, comprising a doughnut-shaped body of cords and wires encased in rubber and generally filled with compressed air to form an <b>inflatable</b> <b>cushion.</b> Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, such as cars, bicycles, motorcycles, trucks, earthmovers, and aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Hip {{fractures}} can be {{a life-threatening}} injury among the elderly. Annually, thirty million falls are reported, of which {{two hundred and fifty}} thousand result in hip fractures. Medical costs for these fractures are estimated between seven and ten billion dollars annually. However, the number of hip fractures is expected to double in the next fifty years, which defines the current problem as critical and alarming. In order to provide a suitable solution to this problem, Dr. Jorge Santiago from the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of Pennsylvania has developed a project to build such device. The product will be a belt-like device that would prevent hip injuries by means of sensors that will recognize a potentially injurious fall and then trigger an <b>inflatable</b> <b>cushion</b> before impact. 1...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} OrthoJacket {{is to develop a}} lightweight, portable, and active {{orthosis}} for the upper limps. The system consists of two special designed fluidic actuators which are used for supporting the elbow function and the internal rotation of the shoulder. A new design of flexible fluid actuator (FFA) is presented that enables more design options of attaching parts, as it is allowed by conventional actuators with a stationary centre of rotation. This advantage and the inherent flexibility and the low weight of this kind of actuator predestined them for the use in exoskeletons, orthoses, and prostheses. The actuator for the elbow generates a maximum torque of 32 [*]Nm; the internal rotation is supported with 7 [*]Nm. Both actuators support the movement with up to 100 % of the necessary power.

50|$|During the 1950s, British {{manufacturing}} firm Saunders-Roe was diversifying {{in various}} new fields and product lines; {{this had been}} {{in part due to}} urgency having been placed on seeking alternative projects {{to take the place of}} the cancelled Saunders-Roe SR.177 interceptor aircraft. In particular, the firm held an intense interest in developing advanced watercraft, such as its commissioning of a two-year study into the potential production of nuclear submarines for freight delivery purposes and the development of an advanced amphibious beach survey vessel, known as WALRUS. Also during this time, British engineer and inventor Christopher Cockerell had been exploring his own concepts on how to produce more efficient fast-moving watercraft, involving multiple technologies such as <b>inflatable</b> air <b>cushions,</b> pump-jets and centrifugal fans; these would effectively emerge as a single new form of amphibious vehicle, later known as the hovercraft.|$|R
40|$|AbstractHybrid {{photovoltaic-thermal}} (PVT) collectors co-generate {{solar electricity}} and heat in a single component with an optimum utilization of space. Spectrally selective but transparent low-emissivity (low-e) coatings are a proven method to reduce thermal losses. However, overheating and stagnation are critical issues for these collectors due to material degradation, thermal stress, and low electrical efficiency. This paper presents a PVT collector concept with variable film insulation as overheating protection. An <b>inflatable</b> glass-film <b>cushion</b> regulates thermal losses. Performance and stagnation tests were carried out with a prototype. During normal operation the collector achieves a high thermal efficiency. In periods of standstill, the deflated cushion has a high heat dissipation rate by deactivating the low-e coating. Stagnation temperatures are thus limited to 95 ̊C. To conclude, the PVT collector combines the advantages of glazed and unglazed PVT collectors which are a high thermal efficiency and low stagnation temperatures...|$|R
50|$|For {{bodies with}} atmospheres, the landing occurs after {{atmospheric}} entry. In these cases, landers may employ parachutes {{to slow down}} and to maintain a low terminal velocity. Sometimes small landing rockets are fired just before impact to reduce the impact velocity. Landing may be accomplished by controlled descent and setdown on landing gear, with the possible addition of a post-landing attachment mechanism for celestial bodies with low gravity. Some missions (for example, Luna 9 and Mars Pathfinder) used <b>inflatable</b> airbags to <b>cushion</b> the lander's impact rather than a more traditional landing gear.|$|R

40|$|Ethylene-tetra-fluoro-ethylene (ETFE) is a {{synthetic}} fluoropolymer. In {{the form of}} ETFE-foil it is applied in building envelopes {{in a single layer}} or more commonly, as <b>inflatable</b> <b>cushions</b> composed of multiple layers. ETFE-foils are widely used as a lightweight building envelope where high translucency, low structural weight, and complex shape is essential. However, limited research in the field of thermal performance of ETFE-foil panels and spaces enclosed with it instigated this study. Therefore, this study investigated (I) the thermal behaviour of ETFE-foil materials and the thermal performance of spaces enclosed with ETFE cushion roofs, (II) used commercially available thermal simulation software to predict the thermal performance of spaces enclosed with ETFE cushion and glass roofs and compared this with actual monitored behaviour (III) identified strategies to improve the thermal performance of spaces enclosed with ETFE cushion roofs in current and projected climate scenarios; and finally (IV) proposed design recommendations of ETFE-foil panels/cushions as a building fabric components. Material properties were investigated in laboratory based experiments. Further data were collected from two custom built outdoor test-rigs equipped with single-, two- and three-layer ETFE-foil panels. Environmental data were collected from two case study buildings to evaluate the thermal performance of the spaces enclosed with ETFE-foil cushion roofs. In addition, building simulation was conducted using EDSL TAS version 9. 3. 3. b to further analyse the indoor thermal environment and compare with monitored behaviour. The study identified variable thermal-optical properties of ETFE foils caused by various percentages of fritted area and its pigment density. The results also identified that the thermal environment of the test-rigs was affected by the variations in the surface temperatures of ETFE-foils and the temperature of air volume between multiple ETFE-foils (in case of two and three layer panels) by convective and radiative heat transfer mechanisms. The results from the case study buildings identified that during hot summer days, indoor air temperature and temperature stratification was higher in the atrium space enclosed with three-layer ETFE-foil cushions compared to the space enclosed with two-layer ETFE-foil cushion covered with rain mesh. However, both of the spaces were overheated during the summer of 2015. To develop an accurate simulation model for ETFE cushion roofs, a novel approach of modelling was developed. The simulation model was validated and calibrated by comparing with measured data from test-rigs and case study buildings. A comparison of predicted results of the spaces enclosed with a multi-layer ETFE-foil cushion roof and a glass roof showed that the extent of overheating was high when spaces were enclosed with glass roofs. Among two-and three-layer ETFE-foil cushion and glass roofs, two-layer ETFE-foil cushions with 75...|$|R
50|$|The {{selection}} of the OR table depends on the primary use of the system. Interventional tables with floating table tops and tilt and cradle compete with fully integrated flexible OR tables. Identification of the right table is a compromise between interventional and surgical requirements. Surgical and interventional requirements may be mutually exclusive. Surgeons, especially orthopedic, general and neurosurgeons usually expect {{a table with a}} segmented tabletop for flexible patient positioning. For imaging purposes, a radiolucent tabletop, allowing full body coverage, is required. Therefore, non-breakable carbon fibre tabletops are used. Interventionalists require a floating tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during angiography. Cardiac and vascular surgeons, in general, have less complex positioning needs, but based on their interventional experience in angiography may be used to having fully motorized movements of the table and the tabletop. For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. <b>inflatable</b> <b>cushions.</b> Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table. The position of the table in the room also impacts surgical workflow. A diagonal position in the OR may be considered in order to gain space and flexibility in the room, as well as access to the patient from all sides. Alternatively, a conventional surgery table can be combined with an imaging system if the vendor offers a corresponding integration. The operating room can then be used either with a radiotranslucent but not breakable tabletop that supports 3D imaging, or with a universal breakable tabletop that provides enhanced patient positioning, but restricts 3D imaging. The latter are particularly suited for neuro- or orthopedic surgery, and these integrated solutions recently also became commercially available. If it is planned to share the room for hybrid and open conventional procedures, these are sometimes preferred. They provide greater workflow flexibility because the tabletops are dockable and can be easily exchanged, but require some compromises with interventional imaging. In summary, important aspects to be included considered are the position in the room, radiolucency (carbon fiber tabletop), compatibility, and integration of imaging devices with the operating table. Further aspects include table load, adjustable table height, and horizontal mobility (floating) including vertical and lateral tilt. It is important to also have proper accessories available, such as rails for mounting special surgical equipment retractors, camera holder). Free floating angiography tables with tilt and cradle capabilities are best suited for cardiovascular hybrid operating rooms.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{speculated that}} SPD {{may be a}} {{misdiagnosis}} for persons with attention problems. For example, a student who fails to repeat what has been said in class (due to boredom or distraction) might be referred for evaluation for sensory integration dysfunction. The student might then be evaluated by an occupational therapist to determine why they are having difficulty focusing and attending, and perhaps also evaluated by an audiologist or a speech-language pathologist for auditory processing issues or language processing issues.Similarly, a child may be mistakenly labeled [...] "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)" [...] because impulsivity has been observed, when actually this impulsivity is limited to sensory seeking or avoiding. A child might regularly jump out of their seat in class despite multiple warnings and threats because their poor proprioception (body awareness) causes them {{to fall out of}} their seat, and their anxiety over this potential problem causes them to avoid sitting whenever possible.If the same child is able to remain seated after being given an <b>inflatable</b> bumpy <b>cushion</b> to sit on (which gives them more sensory input), or, is able to remain seated at home or in a particular classroom but not in their main classroom, it is a sign that more evaluation is needed to determine the cause of their impulsivity.|$|R

Currently, we developed dual CPM device, in which additional CPM cushion was located in the anterior portion of the seat. Effects of these devices in prolonged sitting were determined. A total of 23 male volunteers without {{low back pain}} was recruited. The dual CPM has synchronized two bladders with reciprocal motion in the opposite phase: When one bladder inflates the other deflates. Subjects {{sat in a chair}} for a two-h period on each of four consecutive days under four randomized test modalities: 1, no lumbar support; 2, static lumbar support; 3, lumbar support CPM; and 4,dual CPM. The CPM cycle rate was set at 60 seconds inflation and 60 seconds deflation. Each subject selected an optimal maximum bladder pressure through trial and error. Finally, each subject indicated lumbar discomfort, stiffness, fatigue, and buttock numbness on 10 -cm visual analog scales(VAS). The mean VAS scores from the 4 periods were compared with paired T tests. It was 8. 2 ± 1. 6 without lumbar support, 5. 9 ± 1. 9 with the fixed support, and 5. 7 ± 2. 3 with lumbar support CPM. There was no statistical significant difference between the fixed support and lumbar support CPM. Compared to the lumbar support CPM, significant improvement was obtained with the dual CPM device(p< 0. 05). The benefits of lumbar support CPM over static lumbar support are limited. The effect of dual CPM can be explained by anterior rotation of the pelvis. The dual CPM may provide a comprehensive solution for occupational disability due to sitting intolerance...|$|R
