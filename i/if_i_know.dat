500|$|Pratchett had a {{tendency}} to avoid using chapters, arguing in a Book Sense interview that [...] "life does not happen in regular chapters, nor do movies, and Homer did not write in chapters", adding [...] "I'm blessed <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what function they serve in books for adults." [...] However, there have been exceptions; Going Postal and Making Money and several of his books for younger readers are divided into chapters. Pratchett offered explanations for his sporadic use of chapters; in the young adult titles, he said that he must use chapters because ' editor screams until [...] does', but otherwise felt that they were an unnecessary 'stopping point' that {{got in the way of}} the narrative.|$|E

[...] "Jim's {{the kind of}} director who knows exactly what he wants. As an actor, I {{can find a way}} to get there <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> specifically what I'm going for, and Jim gives me that. The fact that he won't move on until he's got exactly what he wants creates a safe environment, which allows me to experiment and try different things". [...] Cloke described her part as [...] "strong and sassy – in control. After the crash she comes unglued, probably more than any of the kids, and it's a quick, drastic change. I had to understand the psychology of a person who can turn on a dime like that".|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Uhura and Chekov {{question}} passersby about the location of nuclear vessels was filmed with a hidden camera. However, {{the people with whom}} Koenig and Nichols speak were extras hired off the street for that day's shooting and, despite legends to the contrary, knew they were being filmed. In an interview with StarTrek.com, Layla Sarakalo, the extra who said, [...] "I don't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the answer to that... I think it's across the bay, in Alameda," [...] stated that after her car was impounded because she refused to move it for the filming, she approached the assistant director about appearing with the other extras, hoping to be paid enough to get her car out of impoundment. She had been told to act naturally, and so she answered them and the filmmakers kept her response in the film, though she had to be inducted into the Screen Actors Guild in order for her lines to be kept.|$|E
500|$|In late 1910, the new {{government}} introduced legislation to revoke the A's charter and confiscate the proceeds {{from the sale of}} bonds, which were still held by the province. [...] In introducing the bill, Sifton made no commitment as to what would be done with the funds once confiscated. [...] Many northern MLAs, including Cornwall and Cross, suspected that the Premier's plans for the money did not include construction of a northern railway, and opposed the bill on that basis. [...] Clarke re-surfaced in Winnipeg to deny Sifton's charge that the A had defaulted on any of its obligations, and Conservative leader Bennett opposed the confiscation out of stated respect for private property: [...] "Clarke I despise but Clarke I am bound to respect because this province gave him a right by charter and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the United States I do not think it will allow this province to take his property 'without due process of law'." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{speaking}} of A President William Clarke (an American), Bennett {{went on to}} say [...] "Clarke I despise but Clarke I am bound to respect, because this province gave him a right by charter and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the United States I do not think it will allow this province to take his property without due process of the law." [...] The Conservatives, however, had not been expected to support the legislation; the real question was whether Sifton could command enough support among Liberals to pass it. [...] After all, during the Alberta and Great Waterways crisis only nine months earlier, a legislature of very similar makeup had endorsed the Rutherford government's handling of railway policy by a vote of twenty-three votes to fifteen; would Sifton's bill, effectively a repudiation of the Rutherford policy, convince enough Liberals to change sides? [...] The answer came in December, when the bill passed third reading by a vote of twenty-five votes to fourteen. [...] Nine Liberals had reversed themselves and saved Sifton's government, though both Cross and Rutherford were among those to vote against it.|$|E
500|$|Even by the {{standards}} of the British Army, the Regiment (and the 1st Battalion in particular) seems to have gained a reputation during the First World War for profane language. When the 1st Battalion was relieved in the front line following its defence of Delville Wood in September 1916, one of the advanced posts was missed out by mistake. The Lance-Corporal in command, suspecting something was amiss, sent a man back to the front-line trench to investigate. The soldier realised he was at some risk of being shot by his own side, and so [...] "when he had crawled within shouting distance he enquired politely but firmly what —— bastards were holding that —— trench. The 9th East Surreys, who were the troops thus addressed, recognised the North Stafford idiom and let him in unhurt". Bernard Martin, who served as a 2nd Lieutenant with the 1st Battalion, records another incident which probably took place in 1917, when (very unusually) the battalion was addressed at a church parade by a general, who railed against [...] "the disgusting word many of you utter every time you speak. ... I tell you again this indecent word is not to be used any longer. It is so common amongst you that it has become the shameful nickname by which your battalion is known throughout my Division". As the parade ended, one soldier was heard to ask, [...] "What was that bugger gassing about?"; to which another replied, [...] "Buggered <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> I was having a kip. Where's the old bugger gone now?".|$|E

Steve Morse of The Boston Globe said the record [...] "has great songs that tie together beautifully—a welcome {{change from the}} disjointed nature of U2 discs such as 1993's Zooropa and 1997's Pop". He believed that Bono took extra care in crafting the lyrics, resulting in the [...] "most thoughtful, personal, and tender U2 songs in memory". In his review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau felt that the album eschewed the artsier tendencies of U2's previous work in favor of hooky pop songs and stated, [...] "The feat's offhandedness is its most salient charm and nagging limitation. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> anything, which with this band I never have, their best." ...|$|E

They have their own traditions to give us, formed in the society's work of teaching since 1802, and the fruit of the experience gathered, to speak only of Australia and New Zealand, of over 500 Brothers teaching more than 20,000 boys". Liston added, [...] " ... <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the Brothers at all, the boys under their care will be put to hard work - an excellent thing - and teachers will not do for them what they should do for themselves. The thought of the years ahead and of the eternal life will be regarded as of first importance. Teachers will feel it their daily duty to fit the boys to bear life's burdens with a spirit of nobility and to meet life's problems with unfaltering courage". At the conclusion of his speech, Bishop Liston said, [...] "This is a very happy day for me indeed for I owe much more than I can say to the training I received {{at the hands of the}} Christian Brothers in Dunedin long years ago".|$|E
2500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{used for}} the first 26 episodes lists the show's title as The Mechanical Universe, whereas the latter 26 episodes are titled The Mechanical Universe ...and Beyond. The reason for the addition is explained by Goodstein in the closing lecture segment of the final episode: In the first scientific revolution, disputation over the interpretation of human or divine authority was replaced by observation, by measurement, by the testing of hypotheses, all of it with the powerful help of quantitative mathematical reasoning. And the result of all that was the mechanical universe, a universe that inexorably worked out its destiny according to precise, predictable, mechanical laws. Today, we no longer believe in that universe. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the precise position of some particle at some instant of time, I cannot {{have any idea of}} where it's going or how fast. And it doesn't make any difference at all if you say, [...] "All right, you don't know where it's going, but where is it really going?" [...] That is precisely the kind of question that is scientifically meaningless. That {{is the nature of the}} world we live in. That is the quantum mechanical universe.The series can be purchased from Caltech or streamed from online video sources, including Caltech's official YouTube channel. Caltech also posted on YouTube a series of short videos made by Blinn to demonstrate the show's computer animation at SIGGRAPH conferences.|$|E

[...] Wei responded, [...] "I give adverse advise only when I believe that something should not be done. [...] If Your Imperial Majesty did not follow my advice, then if I continued to speak about it, the matter would be settled and would be done. [...] That is why I spoke no further." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "You can first continue planning and then try to advise me again. [...] What harm is there?"
