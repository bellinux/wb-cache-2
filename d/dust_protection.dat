40|$|AbstractDust explosions have {{accounted}} for numerous deaths, disappearance of companies, and large financial losses, and yet {{they are one of}} the least recognized of industrial fire hazards. They can occur within any process where a combustible dust is handled, produced or stored, and can be triggered by any energy source, including static sparks, friction and incandescent material. The management of dust explosion risk includes the implementation of both preventive and protective measures. Whereas preventive measures may reduce explosion risks efficiently, they rarely are sufficient to eliminate explosions completely. Therefore, explosion protection measures often need to be considered as well.

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{cooperated with}} 3 M Company {{in the design}} and testing of a new {{environmentally}} controlled primary crusher operator booth at the company's Wausau granite quarry near Wausau, WI. This quarry had an older crusher booth without a central heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, and without an air filtration and pressurization system. A new replacement operator booth was designed and installed by 3 M based on design considerations from past NIOSH research on enclosed cab filtration systems. NIOSH conducted pre-testing of the old booth and post-testing of the new booth to assess the new filtration and pressurization system's effectiveness in controlling airborne dusts and particulates. The booth's dust and particulate control effectiveness is described by its protection factor, expressed as a ratio of the outside to inside concentrations measured during testing. Results indicate that the old booth provided negligible airborne respirable <b>dust</b> <b>protection</b> and low particulate protection from the outside environment. The newly installed booth provided average respirable <b>dust</b> <b>protection</b> factors from 2 to 25 over five shifts of dust sampling with occasional worker ingress and egress from the booth, allowing some unfiltered contaminants to enter the enclosure. Shorter-term particle count testing outside and inside the booth under near-steady-state conditions, with no workers entering or exiting the booth, resulted in protection factors from 35 to 127 on 0. 3 - to 1. 0 - respirable size particulates under various HVAC airflow operating conditions.
