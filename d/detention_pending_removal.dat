Hong Kong Immigration Department {{officers}} interviewed him, but due to his limited English made little headway in determining who he was or whence he came. They ordered his continued <b>detention</b> <b>pending</b> <b>removal</b> to [...] "a place to be specified". That place {{turned out to be}} mainland China; in early 2000, he was placed on a bus with mainland immigration offenders and sent to Shenzhen, told by police officers that he was going home. While in the mainland, he claims to have suffered electric shock torture and beatings over a period of forty days in two different jails. He was also given a Chinese name.

He appeared in court again on July 8, and was ordered by the judge to remain in <b>detention,</b> <b>pending</b> trial. In court, Harroun's lawyer Geremy Kamens claimed he was confused when he claimed to have joined al-Nusra, wanted to avoid extremists, spoke little Arabic, and actually joined the al Nasser (Victory) brigade (an associate of Jabhat al-Nusra which is not classed as a terrorist organisation). However the prosecution successfully argued that the four confessions Harroun had made to journalists were sufficient evidence {{due to the fact that}} they corroborated factual information, stating that the towns Harroun said he had been in were also strongholds of the al-Nusra front. The magistrate also maintained that he saw the confession as legitimate.|$|R
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 August agents of KGB arrested an activist of the {{campaign}} Michail Bashura and handed him over to officers of Soviet district Regional Office of Internal Affairs of Minsk.

25|$|AMC Networks {{responded to}} Dish's {{announcement}} of its <b>pending</b> <b>removal</b> of the channels as being {{related to a}} 2008 breach of contract lawsuit against Dish Network by former company parent Rainbow Media's Voom HD Networks, {{in which it is}} seeking more than $2.5 billion in damages against Dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract; Voom's high-definition channels were carried on the provider from May 1, 2005 until May 12, 2008 when Dish removed ten of Voom's fifteen channels from its lineup (the five remaining Voom HD channels were removed from Dish the day after).

30|$|Theoretically {{embedded}} in the migration/social policy nexus, this paper investigates cooperation with return (CWR) as a policy tool to remove practical deportation barriers for third-country nationals <b>pending</b> <b>removal.</b> Based on legal and policy documents and expert interviews with stakeholders in Austria and the Netherlands, the paper asks how CWR is implemented and what influence it has, both on migration control aims and on access to social rights. We argue that the politicization of the issue and diverging interests between policy networks of welfare and migration affect the regulation {{and implementation of the}} tool. By comparing the use of CWR within two country contexts, the analysis presented here adds valuable insights on features of governmental instruments in response to the “deportation gap”. The paper further adds to the literature on sanction-oriented, personalized migration policies.|$|R
