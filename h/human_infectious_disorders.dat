40|$|ABSTRACT Congenital Zika {{syndrome}} is an emergent {{cause of a}} congenital <b>infectious</b> <b>disorder,</b> resulting in severe damage to {{the central nervous system}} and microcephaly. Despite advances in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease, we still do not know all the mechanisms enrolled in the vertical transmission of the virus. As has already been reported in other types of congenital <b>infectious</b> <b>disorders</b> in dizygotic twin pregnancies, {{it is possible that the}} virus affects only one of the fetuses. In this article, we report on two cases of twin pregnancies exposed to the Zika virus, but with only one of the fetuses affected with microcephaly and brain damage. This indicates the urgent need for more studies regarding the pathophysiology of viral infection and the mechanisms involved in the natural protection against the virus...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the clinical efficacy of moxalactam {{for treatment of}} a variety of <b>infectious</b> <b>disorders</b> in 50 patients (38 males and 12 females).

Thirty-eight patients had gram-negative bacillary disease, nine had pneumococcal infection, and three had disorders caused by staphylococci or streptococci. Twenty-three patients had pneumonia, 17 had bacteremic diseases other than pneumonia, and 10 had miscellaneous infectious diseases. The overall efficacy of moxalactam was excellent. Forty-eight patients were cured by clinical criteria, and 45 were cured by bacteriological criteria. A total of 19 adverse reactions were {{associated with the use of}} moxalactam in 18 patients, but none were severe and only one necessitated discontinuation of treatment.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of lymphangiectasia is not known; {{however, the}} vesicles associated with lymphangiectasia are suggested to represent saccular dilations of local superficial lymphatics. We present the two cases, a child 12 -year-old, {{and a man}} 29 years old. Both patients had very similar disease history. The affected area appears to be speckled by numerous translucent vesicles with normal-appearing skin among the lesions. The cysts were lobulated, and in a very large number. The vesicles typically measure 2 - 5 mm in diameter. A noteworthy feature was the marked regularity {{in the size of}} the cysts and of their distribution over the surface. Laboratory tests are all physiological limits. Awareness of the occurrence of LC in the scrotum in adult men without prior disease is important to avoid missing the diagnosis, and to prevent inappropriate treatments, because its clinical presentation is similar to <b>infectious</b> <b>disorders.</b> Lymphangiectasia has a good prognosis because most conditions respond well to treatment modalities.

40|$|Purpose : to {{evaluate}} the effect of levoflaxacin 0. 5 % eye drops/Signicef® (Promed Exports, India) for prevention of infectious complications following ocular traumas and intraocular surgery as well as <b>infectious</b> <b>disorders</b> treatment. Methods : In retrospective analysis were included 102 cases of different ophthalmic pathologies following intraocular surgery, i. e., phacoemulsification (27 cases), extracapsular cataract extraction (40 cases), intravitreal injection/IVt of Lucentis (23 cases), abscess/phlegmon drainage (3 cases). Levofloxacin 0. 5 % (Signicef® Eye Drops) was prescribed according to a scheme before and following ocular surgery for prevention and treatment of infectious complications. Results : No infectious complications following eye surgery or IVt were observed.
