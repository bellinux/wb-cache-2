50|$|Intravenous <b>etilefrine</b> {{increases}} the pulse rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, {{central venous pressure}} and mean arterial pressure of healthy individuals. Peripheral vascular resistance falls during the infusion of 1-8 mg <b>etilefrine</b> but begins to rise at higher dosage. Marked falls in pulse rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and peripheral bloodflow, accompanied by rises in mean arterial pressure, occur when <b>etilefrine</b> is infused after administration of intravenous propranolol 2,5 mg. These findings indicate that <b>etilefrine</b> has both β1 and α1 adrenergic effects in man.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etilefrine</b> is {{a cardiac}} {{stimulant}} {{used as an}} antihypotensive. It is a sympathomimetic amine of the 3-hydroxy-phenylethanolamine series used in treating orthostatic hypotension of neurological, cardiovascular, endocrine or metabolic origin. Intravenous infusion of this compound increases cardiac output, stroke volume, venous return and blood pressure in man and experimental animals, suggesting stimulation of both α and β adrenergic receptors. However, in vitro studies indicate that <b>etilefrine</b> has a much higher affinity for β1 (cardiac) than for β2 adrenoreceptors.|$|E
5000|$|The International Tennis Federation {{tribunal}} noted, however, that [...] "The {{amount of}} <b>etilefrine</b> {{detected in the}} positive drugs test {{was too small to}} have any effect on his performance". Puerta appealed against the ban, claiming on his web site that he only ingested trace amounts of it accidentally left over by his wife in a glass. On July 12, 2006 his suspension was reduced to 2 years by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, making him eligible to restart his career on June 5, 2007.|$|E

The suspension was for 8 years, the longest in tennis history at that time. As a result, Puerta was forced to forfeit all his rankings points and prize money from the 2005 French Open onwards, and had all his 2005 results from after the French Open, annulled.

40|$|Acid {{dissociation}} in {{the excited}} state of antihypotensor drug <b>etilefrine</b> [2 -(ethylamino 1 - 3 -hydroxyphenyl) ethanol] is studied. Fluorescence of <b>etilefrine</b> decreases at pH� 7 and {{is related to}} phenolic group dissociation. However, intensity of <b>etilefrine</b> fluorescence diminishes as the concentration of the acetate anion increases at pH� 7. Analyses of the absorption and fluorescence spectra of aqueous solutions of <b>etilefrine</b> {{in the presence of}} acetate anions have been made. Considering the existence of an equilibrium in the excited state the values of 3. 47 × 10 − 9 and 0. 216 × 10 − 9 M − 1 s − 1 have been obtained for the rate constants for direct and inverse reactions, respectively. Moreover, the lifetime (� 0 � = 0. 58 × 10 − 9 s) and quantum yield (0. 01) of non-protonated <b>etilefrine</b> have been determined. Our results seem to support the existence of a dynamic quenching process based on a proton transfer mechanism induced by acetate anions. This process could represent a serious inconvenience in analytical fluorimetric techniques taking into account that the acetic acid/acetate pair is commonly used as a buffer. Additional fluorescence quenching by H + ions could be involved in acid aqueous mediums. At high concentrations of acetic acid, a value of 2. 98 × 10 − 9 M − 1 s − 1 for the bimolecular constant for the quenching by H + has been calculated. © 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Background—Etilefrine is an a-agonist {{agent with}} a potent {{vasoconstrictor}} effect, which is potentially useful in preventing vasovagal syncope by reducing venous pooling and/or by counteracting reflex arteriolar vasodilatation. The present multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled {{study was designed}} to evaluate the efficacy of this drug for the long-term management of patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Methods and Results—In the 20 participating centers, 126 patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope (at least 3 episodes in the last 2 years) and a positive baseline head-up tilt response were randomly assigned to placebo (63 patients) or <b>etilefrine</b> at a dosage of 75 mg/d (63 patients) and were followed up for 1 year or until syncope recurred. The primary end-point of the study was the first recurrence of syncope. There were no differences between the 2 study groups in the patients ’ baseline characteristics. During follow-up, the group treated with <b>etilefrine</b> had a similar incidence of first syncopal recurrence to that of placebo group both in the intention-to-treat analysis (24 % versus 24 %) and in on-treatment analysis (26 % versus 24 %). Moreover, the median time to the first syncopal recurrence did not significantly differ between the 2 study groups (106 days in the <b>etilefrine</b> arm and 112 days in the placebo arm). Conclusions—Oral <b>etilefrine</b> is not superior to placebo in preventing spontaneous episodes of vasovagal syncope. Randomized controlled studies are essential to assess the real usefulness of any proposed therapy for patients with vasovagal syncope. (Circulation. 1999; 99 : 1452 - 1457. ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. This study {{assessed}} {{the efficacy of}} oral <b>etilefrine</b> (10 mg three times a day) in preventing a positive response to head-up tilt testing. Background. Previous reports have suggested that oral etile-frine can be effective ither in preventing a positive response to head-up tilt testing or in reducing syncopal recurrences in pa-tients with vasovagal syncope. Up to now most studies assessing drug therapy in these patients have been uncontrolled. Methods. This was a randomized double-blind crossover study of <b>etilefrine</b> versus placebo in 30 consecutive patients with syncope and a baseline positive head-up tilt test. After the first test, patients had no treatment for 3 days and were randomized to receive tilefrine or placebo for 4 additional days. They underwent tilt testing under treatment and again after 3 days of washout; they then received the alternative treatment for 4 days, and a thir...|$|E

Firstly, on a urine sample spiked {{with a mixture}} of four control substances (methylphenidate, pethidine, caffeine and pipradrol) and secondly, on a real urine sample containing an <b>etilefrine</b> derivative and an artifact (BHT antioxidant), which were coeluted in the same GC peak. In both the cases clear full spectra of various component substances were extracted from the mixture spectra. The time of GC/MS analysis was significantly reduced. PCA was used in both the cases as an exploratory method of data analysis...|$|E
30|$|Chylothorax is a {{life-threatening}} complication after esophagectomy, and conservative treatments such as thoracostomy drainage, low-fat diet, nil per os (NPO), and TPN should be administered before resorting to lymphography. Marts et al. reported that chylothorax was resolved by conservative treatment in 79 % of patients [12]. Octreotide [13] and <b>etilefrine</b> [14] were also {{reported to be}} effective for chylothorax, and a pleurodesis is a conservative option if NPO is ineffective [15]. Thoracic duct ligation is also an effective therapy, and the success rate is now 85 – 100 % [3, 16]. Even if {{the location of the}} lymphatic leakage is not detected during surgery, ligation of the lymphatic duct just above the diaphragm improves chylothorax [1]. Reisenauer et al. reported an algorithm for the management of postoperative chylothorax [16], including surgical thoracic duct ligation if the chest tube output is >[*] 1100 [*]ml after NPO and TPN. If surgical ligation is ineffective, they advocated lymphangiography and thoracic duct embolization. We chose lymphography before surgical ligation because we considered that lymphography was less invasive than surgery and the location of lymphatic leakage could be identified. Given that our case presented with a rare but critical complication of Lipiodol lymphography, surgical ligation was an appropriate prevenient treatment strategy when the chest tube output exceeded 1100 [*]ml after NPO.|$|E
40|$|Background: Left {{ventricular}} wall rupture {{remains a}} major lethal complication of {{acute myocardial infarction}} and hypertension is a well-known predisposing factor of cardiac rupture after myocardial infarction. Case presentation: An 87 -year-old man was admitted to our hospital, diagnosed as acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The echocardiogram showed 0. 67 -cm 2 aortic valve, consistent with severe aortic stenosis (AS). A coronary angiography showed a chronic occlusion of the proximal left circumflex artery and a 99 % stenosis and thrombus in the mid right coronary artery. During percutaneous angioplasty of the latter, transient hypotension and bradycardia developed {{at the time of}} balloon inflation, and low doses of noradrenaline and <b>etilefrine</b> were intravenously administered as needed. The patient suddenly lost consciousness and developed electro-mechanical dissociation. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation followed by insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and percutaneous cardiopulmonary support were initiated. The echocardiogram revealed moderate pericardial effusion, though the site of free wall rupture was not distinctly visible. A left ventriculogram clearly showed an infero-posterior apical wall rupture. Surgical treatment was withheld because of the interim development of brain death. Conclusions: In this patient, who presented with severe AS, the administration of catecholamine to stabilize the blood pressure probably increased the intraventricular pressures considerably despite apparently normal measurements of the central aortic pressure. IABP, temporary pacemaker, or both are recommended instead of intravenous catecholamines for patients with AMI complicated with significant AS to stabilize hemodynamic function during angioplasty...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of chylous fistula, subsequent to neck nodal dissection, includes either unstandardized conservative procedures and reoperation. The main reason of controversy in literature is {{probably due to}} the rarity (1 - 2. 5 %) of such troublesome complication due to inadvertent disruption of the thoracic duct itself or of its tributary branches. We report one case of severe cervical chylous fistula, occurred after left lateral dissection for advanced papillary thyroid carcinoma, and successfully restored by a conservative approach. None of the following treatment modalities was effective: pressure dressing, low-fat diet, octreotide, <b>etilefrine,</b> and local tetracycline sclerotherapy. Instead, fasting combined with total venous nutritional replacement was successful in curing the leak. It may be hypothesized that the beneficial effect on chyle production observed in the present patient in fasting condition, could be explained by a decrease of splancnic blood flow consequent to intestinal feeding rest. The other treatment procedures can be adjunctive methods with impredictable effect. As a standard approach with the aim to prevent and treat cervical lymphorrea, we suggest preoperatory fat meal, intraoperative search for milky leak by positive respiratory pressure, ligation of the thoracic duct (a mesh coverage when necessary) if inadvertently damaged, but not a systematic search for it. Moreover, according to the amount and the duration of the leakage, fasting combined with venous supplement by central or peripheral access, in combination with local treatment by sclerosing agents appears to be efficacious. In our opinion, neck reoperation or intrathoracic ligation of the thoracic duct represent the last therapeutic option of unresponsive or untractable cases...|$|E
