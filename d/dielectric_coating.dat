25|$|Vacuum {{deposition}} {{began with}} {{the study of the}} sputtering phenomenon during the 1920s and 1930s, which was a common problem in lighting in which metal ejected from the electrodes coated the glass, blocking output. However, turning sputtering into a reliable method of coating a mirror did not occur until the invention of semiconductors in the 1970s. Evaporation coating was pioneered by John Strong in 1912. Aluminum was a desirable material for mirrors, but was too dangerous to apply with electroplating. Strong used evaporation coating to make the first aluminum telescope mirrors in the 1930s. The first dielectric mirror was created in 1937 by Auwarter using evaporated rhodium, while the first metallic mirror to be enhanced with a <b>dielectric</b> <b>coating</b> of silicon dioxide was created by Hass the same year. In 1939 at the Schott Glass company, Walter Geffcken invented the first dielectric mirrors to use multilayer coatings (stacks).|$|E

Also, in real interferometers, the thicknesses of the beamsplitters may differ, and the path lengths are not necessarily equal.

50|$|A G-line {{is a type}} of waveguide, {{rather than}} a wire in an {{electric}} circuit. The G-line functions by slowing the propagation velocity of EM waves below the free-space velocity, causing the wavefronts to slightly bend inwards towards the conductor, which keeps the waves entrained. Bends of large radius are tolerated, but too sharp a bend in the single wire will cause the line to radiate and lose energy into space. In theory the <b>dielectric</b> <b>coating</b> is a requirement, it slows the wave and focuses it along the wire.

Hence, the importance of a proper investigation tool that allows to determine and recognize the potential presence of perioperative and/or postoperative diseases becomes clear. Although the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique demonstrated several advantages over the other common tomography tools, it suffers from the arise of image artefacts if it is performed in presence of metallic prostheses. In particular, the so-called RF-artefacts are caused by the inhomogeneity in the radiofrequency magnetic field of MRI, due to the electric currents induced on the metal surface by the field itself. In this work, a near-zero permittivity <b>dielectric</b> <b>coat</b> is simulated to reduce those currents and, therefore, the RF-artefacts onset in the final image.

50|$|Dielectric {{coatings}} {{are used}} in Schmidt-Pechan roof prisms to cause the prism surfaces {{to act as a}} dielectric mirror. The non-metallic dielectric reflective coating is formed from several multilayers of alternating high and low refractive index materials deposited on the roof prism's reflective surfaces. Each single multilayer reflects a narrow band of light frequencies so several multilayers, each tuned to a different color, are required to reflect white light. This multi-multilayer coating increases reflectivity from the prism surfaces by acting as a distributed Bragg reflector. A well-designed <b>dielectric</b> <b>coating</b> can provide a reflectivity of more than 99% across the visible light spectrum. This reflectivity is much improved compared to either an aluminium mirror coating (87% to 93%) or silver mirror coating (95% to 98%).|$|E

50|$|A beam {{splitter}} {{that consists of}} a glass plate with a reflective <b>dielectric</b> <b>coating</b> on one side gives a phase shift of 0 or π, depending on the side from which it is incident (see figure). Transmitted waves have no phase shift. Reflected waves entering from the reflective side (red) are phase-shifted by π, whereas reflected waves entering from the glass side (blue) have no phase shift. This {{is due to the}} Fresnel equations, according to which reflection causes a phase shift only when light passing through a material of low refractive index is reflected at a material of high refractive index. This is the case in the transition of air to reflector, but not from glass to reflector (given that the refractive index of the reflector is in between that of glass and that of air).|$|E
50|$|In {{the most}} common configuration, the gain medium {{is in the form}} of a rod located at one focus of a {{mirrored}} cavity, consisting of an elliptical cross-section perpendicular to the rod's axis. The flashlamp is a tube located at the other focus of the ellipse. Often the mirror's coating is chosen to reflect wavelengths that are shorter than the lasing output while absorbing or transmitting wavelengths that are the same or longer, to minimize thermal lensing. In other cases an absorber for the longer wavelengths is used. Often, the lamp is surrounded by a cylindrical jacket called a flow tube. This flow tube is usually made of a glass that will absorb unsuitable wavelengths, such as ultraviolet, or provide a path for cooling water which absorbs infrared. Often, the jacket is given a <b>dielectric</b> <b>coating</b> that reflects unsuitable wavelengths of light back into the lamp. This light is absorbed and some of it is re-emitted at suitable wavelengths. The flow tube also serves to protect the rod in the event of a violent lamp failure.|$|E
50|$|The {{other major}} type of optical coating is the <b>dielectric</b> <b>coating</b> (i.e. using {{materials}} {{with a different}} refractive index to the substrate). These are constructed from thin layers of materials such as magnesium fluoride, calcium fluoride, and various metal oxides, which are deposited onto the optical substrate. By careful choice of the exact composition, thickness, and number of these layers, {{it is possible to}} tailor the reflectivity and transmitivity of the coating to produce almost any desired characteristic. Reflection coefficients of surfaces can be reduced to less than 0.2%, producing an antireflection (AR) coating. Conversely, the reflectivity can be increased to greater than 99.99%, producing a high-reflector (HR) coating. The level of reflectivity can also be tuned to any particular value, for instance to produce a mirror that reflects 90% and transmits 10% of the light that falls on it, over some range of wavelengths. Such mirrors are often used as beamsplitters, and as output couplers in lasers. Alternatively, the coating can be designed such that the mirror reflects light only in a narrow band of wavelengths, producing an optical filter.|$|E

50|$|Three-dimensional droplet {{actuation}} {{has been}} made possible by implementing a closed system; this system contains a µL sized droplet in immiscible fluid medium. The droplet and medium are then sandwiched between two electromagnetic plates, creating an EM field between the two plates. The purpose of this method is to transfer the droplet from a lower planar surface to an upper parallel planar surface and back down via electrostatic forces. The physics behind such particle actuation and perpendicular movement can be understood from early works of N. N. Lebedev and I. P. Skal’skaya. In their research, they attempted to model the Maxwell electrical charge acquired by a perfectly round conducting particle {{in the presence of}} a uniform magnetic field caused by a perfectly-conducting and infinitely-stretching surface. Their model helps to predict the Z-direction motion of the microdroplets within the device as it points to the magnitude and direction of forces acting upon a micro droplet. This can be used to help accurately predict and correct for unwanted and uncontrollable particle movement. The model explains why failing to employ <b>dielectric</b> <b>coating</b> on one of the two surfaces causes reversal of charge within the droplet upon contact with each electrode and in turn causes the droplets to uncontrollably bounce of between electrodes.|$|E
50|$|In {{binoculars}} with roof prisms {{the light}} path is {{split into two}} paths that reflect {{on either side of}} the roof prism ridge. One half of the light reflects from roof surface 1 to roof surface 2. The other half of the light reflects from roof surface 2 to roof surface 1. This causes the light to become partially polarized (due to a phenomenon called Brewster's angle). During subsequent reflections the direction of this polarization vector is changed but it is changed differently for each path in a manner similar to a Foucault pendulum. When the light following the two paths is recombined the polarization vectors of each path do not coincide. The angle between the two polarization vectors is called the phase shift, or the geometric phase, or the Berry phase. This interference between the two paths with different geometric phase results in a varying intensity distribution in the image reducing apparent contrast and resolution compared to a porro prism erecting system. These unwanted interference effects can be suppressed by vapor depositing a special <b>dielectric</b> <b>coating</b> known as a phase-correction coating or P-coating on the roof surfaces of the roof prism. This coating corrects for the difference in geometric phase between the two paths so both have effectively the same phase shift and no interference degrades the image.|$|E

The 1.55-meter telescope was also used to observe and track NASA's Deep Impact Spacecraft, as it navigated to a successful inter-planetary impact with the celebrated Comet 9p/Tempel, in 2005.
