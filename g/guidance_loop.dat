40|$|AbstractThis article {{analyzes}} the problem about the missile overload requirement in a homing terminal guidance under various engagement scenarios. An augmented proportional navigation guidance (APNG) model is introduced {{on the basis}} of linear kinematics. To analyze the peak-to-peak performance of the terminal guidance system, a new finite time L 1 performance measure for a linear time-varying (LTV) continuous system is proposed. Then, according to the idea of the adjoint system, a novel method for computing the L 1 norm of a linear continuous system is first derived. Within the finite time L 1 framework, the quantitative relation between the <b>guidance</b> <b>loop</b> dynamics and the maximum missile-target maneuver ratio is offered. This relation is expressed in the form of graphs and formulas {{that can be used to}} synthesize some of the major subsystem specifications for the missile guidance system.

40|$|Today {{the armed}} forces of many {{countries}} need to strike accurately potential enemies, wherever they might be, from a safe place. Since naval units can be deployed almost everywhere in the open sea, the idea of a naval cruise missile emerged in the 70 ’s. These missiles are designed to be launched from various naval vehicles such as frigates or submarines and strike deeply in the enemy territory. A program called Missile de Croisière Naval (MdCN Naval Cruise Missile) was therefore launched in 2006 by the DGA, the French procurement agency. MBDA is the industrial company appointed by the DGA to design and build the missile. Control aspects on a cruise missile are of primary interest since they impact the reliability, performance and availability of the weapon. In the aeronautics and weapon industry, gain scheduled controllers are used in most cases. However, many non-linear techniques have been developed in the literature and might improve the behaviour of the missile.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} at obtaining robust guidance laws to ensure zero miss distance (ZMD) for interceptors with parametric uncertainties. All these laws require {{the plant to}} be of minimum phase type to enable the overall <b>guidance</b> <b>loop</b> transfer function to satisfy strict positive realness (SPR). The SPR property implies absolute stability of the closed loop system, and {{has been shown in}} the literature to lead to ZMD because it avoids saturation of lateral acceleration. In these works higher order interceptors are reduced to lower order equivalent models for which control laws are designed to ensure ZMD. However, it has also been shown that when the original system with right half plane (RHP) zeros is considered, the resulting miss distances, using such strategies, can be quite high. In this paper, an alternative approach using the circle criterion establishes the conditions for absolute stability of the <b>guidance</b> <b>loop</b> and relaxes the conservative nature of some earlier results arising from assumption of in�nite engagement time. Further, a feedforward scheme in conjunction with a lead-lag compensator is used as one control strategy while a generalized sampled hold function is used as a second strategy, to shift the RHP transmission zeros, thereby achieving ZMD. It is observed that merely shifting the RHP zero(s) to the left half plane reduces miss distances signi�cantly even when no additional controllers are used to ensure SPR conditions...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally {{performance}} analysis of <b>guidance</b> <b>loops</b> against weaving targets is performed by {{assuming that the}} acceleration of the target is sinusoidal (barrel-S maneuver) or, in any case, periodic with a fixed period. Either by direct simulation, or by using the Adjoint Method, {{it is easy to}} compute the miss distance for each of these maneuvers and for different flight times. However, realistic targets never display perfectly periodic maneuvers. In reality, the period of the maneuver is likely to vary during the flight. In this paper, we study the performance against weaving targets when the weaving trajectory is uncertain and variable during the time of flight. First, the performance of classical Proportional Navigation against such maneuvers is considered. Subsequently, we consider a special guidance law designed to perform against weaving targets, if the weaving period is known. It is assumed that the weaving period is determinded using an (Extended) Kalman filter on the measurements of the seeker. Using the method proposed in this paper, it is possible to determine requirements for the accuracy of the estimates of the weaving trajectory that will allow the missile to fulfill its own performance requirements. © 2008 by TNO, The Netherlands...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{evaluating}} {{the performance of}} an uncertain <b>guidance</b> <b>loop</b> system is considered, when the uncertainty is {{described in terms of}} an integral quadratic constraint. The idea of the approach proposed in this paper is to determine the set of all possible state vector values {{at the end of the}} flight that are compatible with the model uncertainty and determine the upper and lower bound for the miss distance by solving two optimization problems on this set. The main theoretical result of the paper shows that this is a quadric that can be determined by the solving a differential Riccati equation and a set of coupled linear differential equations. Unfortunately, numerical experiments showed that the method is practically unusable for realistic models of guidance loops. A single integral quadratic constraint is a poor representation of the usual model uncertainties, meaning that the results are certainly too conservative. In addition, the optimization problem turns out to be badly conditioned in all cases of interest for homing <b>guidance</b> <b>loop</b> analysis. This is illustrated using a contrived numerical example based on a relatively well-behaved linear time-invariant system. Although in its present form, the approach taken in this paper did not achieve the results that were hoped for, the ideas advanced here, and some of the technical results are interesting in themselves and may be useful in future research on this theme...|$|E

40|$|A {{guidance}} system with reconfiguration capabilities {{has been developed}} for reusable launch vehicles (RLVs). The focus of the development is on reconfiguration after a catastrophic effector failure during final approach – a failure that would otherwise cause loss of the vehicle. We assume here that the vehicle employs a reconfigurable inner-loop control system that recovers some maneuvering capabilities and maintains attitude stability. However, for RLVs, it {{is often the case}} that nominal performance cannot be fully recovered, and the outer-loop {{guidance system}} must account for the degraded response characteristics. Two approaches are presented. The first approach augments the existing production guidance system with adaptation capabilities. A case study shows that stability is maintained following a primary pitch effector failure. However, it is shown that the trajectory commands to the <b>guidance</b> <b>loops</b> must also be re-targeted in order to achieve a safe landing. The second approach employs an on-line optimal trajectory re-targeting algorithm. A database of neighboring optimal trajectories is encoded in an efficient manner and interrogated on line at regular intervals.

Implementation of this algorithm broadens the range of possible applications of small unmanned aerial vehicles. The solution proposed takes explicit {{advantage of the fact}} that normally these vehicles are equipped with autopilots stabilizing the vehicles and providing angular-rate tracking capabilities. Therefore, the overall closed-loop system exhibits naturally an inner–outer (dynamics–kinematics) control loop structure. The outer-loop path-following control law developed relies on a nonlinear control strategy derived at the kinematic level, while the inner-loop consisting of the autopilot together with an L 1 adaptive augmentation loop is designed to meet strict performance requirements in the presence of unmanned aerial vehicle modeling uncertainty and environmental disturbances. A rigorous proof of stability and performance of the path-following closed-loop system, including the dynamics of the unmanned aerial vehicle with its autopilot, is given.
