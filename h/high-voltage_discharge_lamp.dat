Due to advantages such as long duration and significant bubble pulsation production, this technique is widely used in industrial production. Bubble pulsation is directly reflected by the pulsation efficiency, which is mainly embodied in the transformation efficiency from the <b>high-voltage</b> <b>discharge</b> energy to the bubble expansion energy, as well as the residual rate of bubble pulsation energy. In this study, <b>high-voltage</b> <b>discharge</b> was used in water to form pulsating bubbles. The vertical displacement of water was restricted by the experimental equipment, so horizontal displacement was mainly generated. Therefore, any influence caused by the ascending motion of the bubbles could be effectively ignored. Consequently, the bubble pulsation process could be measured at stable hydraulic pressure. The pressure, bubble pulsation period and pulsation times generated by bubble expansion were measured in our experiments. The transient voltage and current were also measured. The relationship between bubble pulsation efficiency with discharge voltage and hydrostatic pressure was analyzed by combining the experimental results with results from simulations of bubble pulsation expansion...|$|R

The paper treats their contributions to high pressure mercury <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps,</b> especially the water cooled super high pressure mercury <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> with a pressure of a few hundreds of atmosphere. Because of their rather white colour and high efficiency, high pressure mercury lamps were, from 1906 on, a potential rival of the incandescent lamps, especially for street and square lighting. However, severe problems with the ignition of the gas discharge and the lead-in wires prevented the introduction of these lamps at that time. In the early thirties Bol contributed to a great extend to {{the solution of the}} problem of the lead-in wires, after which super high pressure mercury <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> were technically feasible. Elenbaas theoretically derived mathematical relations between technically important variables, such as efficiency, candlepower and luminence, which were instrumental in the invention and development of super high pressure mercury lamps. Some remarks are made on the differences between scientifically and technically oriented theories. It is concluded that in an industrial context a special kind of theories is developed which could be denominated 'technological theories'. ...|$|R
