5|$|The Palace of Whitehall, to {{the east}} of the road, was {{originally}} named York Palace, but was renamed during the reign of Henry VIII. The palace was redesigned in 1531–32 and became the King's main residence later in the decade. He married Anne Boleyn here in 1533, followed by Jane Seymour in 1536, and died at the palace in 1547. Charles <b>I</b> <b>owned</b> an extensive art collection at the palace and several of William Shakespeare's plays had their first performances here. It ceased to be a royal residence after 1689, when William III moved to Kensington Palace. The palace was damaged by fire in 1691, following which the front entrance was redesigned by Sir Christopher Wren. In 1698, most of the palace burned to the ground accidentally after a fire started by a careless washerwoman.|$|E

500|$|Seara ( [...] , meaning [...] "The Evening") was a daily {{newspaper}} published in Bucharest, Romania, {{before and during}} World War <b>I.</b> <b>Owned</b> by politician Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino and, through most of its existence, managed by the controversial Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, it was an unofficial and unorthodox tribune for the Conservative Party. Its involvement in politics sparked numerous scandals, the longest of which came during the neutrality period (1914–1916). Strongly anti-Slavic, Seara stood out in that context for supporting the German Empire and Central Powers, and was widely alleged of having been financed by a German propaganda machine. In 1914, it was purchased by German businessmen, but continued to register mediocre success in comparison with its pro-Entente competitors. In late 1916, after Romania decided {{in favor of the}} Entente, Seara was disestablished.|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} {{decided to keep}} {{publicity}} down during the recording of their fourth album, as the group was taken aback by such press surrounding Infinity on High. Sessions proved to {{be difficult for the}} band as Wentz started taking LSD when Zach Blair lead guitarist for Rise Against made him try it at a party in April 2008. The goal in Wentz using LSD was to hope it would influence his songwriting, but it just made him distracted from writing songs, which annoyed Stump, so he stopped using LSD in August 2008. Wentz later said he had taken LSD over 50 times. Stump called the making of the album [...] "painful", noting that he and Wentz quarreled over many issues, revealing [...] "I threw something across the room over a major-to-minor progression." [...] On previous albums, Trohman felt he and Hurley did not have enough musical freedom and that Stump and Wentz exerted too much control over the group: [...] "I felt, 'Man, this isn't my band anymore.' It's no one's fault, and I don't want to make it seem that way. It was more of a complex I developed based off of stuff I was reading. It's hard to hear, 'Joe and Andy are just along for the ride.'" [...] To amend the situation, Trohman sat down with Stump to communicate his concerns, which led to more collaboration on Folie à Deux. [...] "It made me feel like <b>I</b> <b>owned</b> the songs a lot more. It made me really excited about contributing to Fall Out Boy and made me find my role in the band," [...] Trohman recalled.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{decided to keep}} {{publicity}} down during the album's recording, as they were taken aback by such press surrounding Infinity on High. Stump entered the studio with music for almost 50 songs. Folie à Deux {{was intended to be}} very different from the previous three Fall Out Boy albums, which were all interconnected musically and thematically; Stump described the new songs as [...] "having a lot of freedom [...] it's our first just plain old record in a while."

2500|$|In late December it was {{announced}} that Bank of America had bought up more than 300 Internet domain names in an attempt to preempt bad publicity that might be forthcoming in the anticipated WikiLeaks release. The domain names included as BrianMoynihanBlows.com, BrianMoynihanSucks.com and similar names for other top executives of the bank. Nick Baumann of Mother Jones ridiculed this effort, stating: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>owned</b> stock in Bank of America, this would not give me confidence that the bank is prepared for whatever Julian Assange is planning to throw at it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hapa Project {{was created}} to promote {{awareness}} and recognition {{of the millions of}} multiracial/multiethnic individuals of Asian/Pacific Islander descent in the U.S; to give voice to multiracial people and previously ignored ethnic groups; to dispel myths of exoticism, hybrid vigor and racial homogeneity; to foster positive identity formation and self-image in multiracial children; and to encourage solidarity and empowerment within the multiracial/Hapa community. [...] Fulbeck also notes that a main objective [...] "... was to make the book I wish <b>I</b> <b>owned</b> when I was a kid. I never knew anyone else like me, going through things I went through, not fitting in, always having to choose sides ... Identity is a personal process and I’m adamant that it should be a personal decision, not one made by a community, a government or others." ...|$|E

[...] Frank Goings, {{the chief of the}} Indian Police and interpreter for the agency, had brought the Boys’ Band from the boarding school, with all their instruments. In between the Indian songs, the band would play. I then started giving away things I had brought along. I kept this up until I had given away everything <b>I</b> <b>owned,</b> and my wife and I walked away with practically nothing. [...] We figured that we gave away that day about a thousand dollars’ worth of goods ourselves, not counting all the presents that had been donated to be distributed.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Stone grew up {{listening}} {{to a wide variety of}} music including 1960s and 1970s American R and soul music performed by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. [...] "My first CD that <b>I</b> <b>owned</b> was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, 'Oh yeah, that looks really good', so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, 'Can I have that for Christmas?' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved." [...] She would later tell MTV News: [...] "I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You've got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little." ...|$|E
