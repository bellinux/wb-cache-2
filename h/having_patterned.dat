30|$|This paper {{presents}} a non-contact manipulation method using rotational flow generated by {{high speed motion}} of a glass needle. In order to generate an applicable motion that can precisely control the speed and position of a target object around an end effector, a manipulator actuated by three piezoelectric actuators is proposed. A compact parallel link produces precise three-dimensional motions. To reach the required end-effector frequency and amplitude, which is necessary for generating the rotational flow that can make rotational movement of microbeads <b>having</b> <b>patterned</b> data, the end effector motion is generated by controlling the three piezoelectric actuators at high speed. In this paper, we focus on rotational flow created by two-dimensional circular motion of the end effector mounted on the parallel link. By changing the amplitude and frequency of the circular motion, the generated swirl flow is analyzed in 3 D space using 9.6 -μm microbeads. We analyzed the velocity toward {{to the root of}} the end effector and angular velocity around the end effector by formulating models. From the analyzed data, we verified that the rotational flow has potential to manipulate micro-objects precisely in 3 D space.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Thyrotropin (TSH) -secreting {{pituitary}} adenoma (TSHoma) {{and resistance}} to thyroid hormone (RTH) are two forms of inappropriate TSH secretion. Thyroid blood flow is largely TSH dependent. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether thyroid blood flow may help to differentiate TSHoma and RTH. DESIGN: Intrathyroidal color flow Doppler sonography (CFDS) pattern and peak systolic velocity (PSV) were assessed at baseline and during T(3) suppression test on eight consecutive patients with TSHoma and 10 with RTH. MAIN OUTCOME: All controls <b>had</b> CFDS <b>pattern</b> 0. Three RTH patients <b>had</b> <b>pattern</b> I and seven <b>had</b> <b>pattern</b> II. Two TSHoma patients <b>had</b> <b>pattern</b> I, five <b>had</b> <b>pattern</b> II, and one <b>had</b> <b>pattern</b> III. PSV at baseline was 3. 8 +/- 1. 3 cm/s in controls, 8. 8 +/- 2. 5 cm/s in RTH, 11. 1 +/- 2. 7 cm/s in TSHoma (p < 0. 0003 vs. controls, p = 0. 087 RTH vs. TSHoma). After T 3 suppression test, PSV values were lower in RTH than in TSHoma (4. 6 +/- 1. 8 vs. 7. 7 +/- 2. 6 cm/s, p = 0. 008). PSV values and CFDS pattern normalized in nine and eight RTH patients, respectively, after T(3) suppression test; conversely, only one TSHoma patient had a normalization of PSV values, and none had a normalization of CFDS pattern (p < 0. 003 vs. RTH). CONCLUSIONS: Both RTH and TSHoma <b>have</b> increased CFDS <b>pattern</b> and PSV values; however, after T(3) both parameters normalized in most patients with RTH but not in those with TSHoma. Accordingly, CFDS pattern and PSV are adjunctive tools to differentiate these two forms of inappropriate TSH secretion...|$|R

40|$|Demand for {{low-cost}} {{alternatives to}} conventional medical diagnostic sensors {{has been the}} driving force that has spurred significant developments in the diagnostics field. Paper-based fluidic devices, proposed by the Whitesides’ group in 2007, have been regarded as one such alternative. Research into the development of methodologies that control, and in particular delay the flow of fluids in these devices is an urgently needed requirement that would enable greater functionalities in such paper-based sensors. In this work, to control fluid-flow, we report {{the use of a}} new laser-based direct-write technique that allows programmable fluid delivery in channels within a paper-based device. The technique is based on laser-induced photo-polymerisation, and through adjustment of the laser writing parameters, such as the output power and writing/scanning speed, we can control the porosity of hydrophobic barriers which, when introduced in the fluid paths, produce controllable fluid delay. <b>Having</b> <b>patterned</b> these barriers at pre-defined locations within fluidic channels, we have achieved flow-delays with a time span ranging from few minutes to an hour and we have also performed a study to understand the influence of the number of barriers and their position on the flow-delay. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of such programmable flow delays through a semi-automated paper-sensor that implements a multi-step ELISA for detection of C-reactive protein with a limit-of-detection of 10 ng/mL (Figure 2) - wherein separate flow-arms (with differently programmed delays) were used to sequentially deliver the different reagents through to the detection zone for effecting the multi-step assay. Since the channels and flow delay barriers can be written via a common laser-writing process, this is a distinct improvement over other methods that require specialist operating environments, or custom-designed equipment. This technique can therefore be used for rapid fabrication of paper-based microfluidic sensors that can perform single or multistep analytical assays...|$|E
40|$|Demand for {{low-cost}} {{alternatives to}} conventional medical diagnostic tools {{has been the}} driving force that has spurred significant developments in the diagnostics field. Paper-based fluidics, proposed by the Whitesides’ group in 2007 has been regarded as one such alternative, and consequently, this field has been progressing rapidly {{and a range of}} paper-based fluidic devices that implement different assays have since been demonstrated. Research into the development of methodologies that control, and in particular delay the flow of fluids in these devices is an urgently needed requirement that would enable greater functionalities in such paper-based devices. In this work, to control fluid-flow, we report the use of a new approach that is based on the laser-based photo-polymerisation technique that we have reported earlier for the creation of fluidic patterns (channels/wells) in paper. The delay or slowing down, of the fluid-flow in a fluidic channel is achieved via the introduction of barriers aligned across the direction of the fluid-flow – in a fashion similar to how speed-bumps enable traffic-calming control on a road. The schematic in Figure 1 a shows how the delay can be introduced via the creation/insertion of barriers which are solid and impermeable and by controlling the ‘depth’ of the solid/impregnable barriers (Figure 1) to allow for controlled leakage of the fluids under the barriers. The control over the depth of the barriers is obtained by simply adjusting the laser-writing parameters such as the output power and writing/scanning speed. We observe that solid/impregnable barriers of various depths decrease the fluid flow by a rate that is proportional to their depth. <b>Having</b> <b>patterned</b> these barriers at pre-defined locations in the fluidic channel, using a pulsed laser operating at 266 nm (20 Hz, 10 ns) we have achieved flow-delays with a time span ranging from few minutes to over an hour. We have also performed a study to understand the influence of the number of barriers and their position on the flow-delay, and this is shown in Figure 2. Since the channels and flow-delay barriers can be written via a common laser-writing procedure, this technique has a distinct advantage over certain other methods that require specialist operating environments, or custom-designed equipment to enable both these aspects. We believe this rapid and versatile technique is therefore suited for fabrication of ‘sample-in-read-out’ type automated paper-based microfluidic devices that can implement single/multistep analytical assays...|$|E
