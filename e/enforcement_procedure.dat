40|$|The {{increase}} {{in international trade}} creates {{a growing number of}} disputes between parties from different countries. International arbitration is the most preferred mechanism to solve disputes in international trade. If the failing party does not voluntarily comply with the award, the successful party must apply for recognition and enforcement of the award in order to obtain the remedies. Since China {{is one of the major}} business markets in the world, several of the companies committed to arbitral procedures are likely to have assets in China. This means that, if a party fails to honour an award, an <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedure</b> may begin within a Chinese court. The enforcement procedures in China are said to be insufficient and not to comply with international standards. International conventions and treaties provide for a high level of security in the recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedure</b> of the arbitral award. The most used and important instrument for recognition and enforcement is the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958, to which China as well as Sweden are Contracting States. According to the Convention, an international arbitral award may only be refused under certain grounds laid down in the Convention. An analysis of the legal situation in China confirms that there are problems associated with the enforcement of arbitral awards. These problems are not, however, connected with the concept of international arbitral awards, but rather with the entire judicial system in China. Even though an enforcing party can do little to overcome these problems, certain measures can be taken in order to ease the <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the distrubution of {{responsibilities}} in the environmental law <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{between the state and}} the individual environmental actor. The state and its public authorities have a fundamental environmental responsibility. This responsibility is nevertheless shared with the actors. Actor responsibilities include taking sufficient precautionary measures, and controling the own activities. This also covers responsibilities for knowledge and investigation, which are in focus in the thesis analysis. Such responsibilities are enforced by administrative authorities. Enforcement, however, also entails exercise of public power against the individual, and thus warrants proper procedure and safeguards of legal certainty.  Such procedural responsibilities include ensuring decision making materials to support their exercise of authority. It also means that the authority has formulate clearly to the actor what their legal duties are, and what they need to do to avoid further enforcement. These administrative duties may entail the authority taking over the actor's information responsibilities under environmental law. Enforcement of actor responsibilities thus becomes inconsistent, or even contraproductive. This thesis comprises analysis of the meeting of environmental and administrative law in the enforcement situation. The analysis is focused on balancing effective implementation and enforcement of policy aims, and the safeguards of the individual's rights and freedoms. The aims is to find ways to coordingate instead of prioritising these objectives.  The research is based on a comparative study and analysis of the enforcement systems of Sweden, the United Kingdom (England and Wales), and the Netherlands. The importance of distinguising between the different purposes and aims of the responsibilities is argued. Actor responsibilities for precaution and information should be recognised also in the <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedure.</b> A communicative <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedure,</b> and more purposive assessment of the proper distribution of responsibilities in the individual case may provide both effective enforcement and legal certainty.

Chamber of enforcement agents is not completely autonomous but under control of the Ministry of Justice. Besides enforcement agents court bailiffs still continue to exist.

The Symposium is now an {{established}} tradition for the University. In 2015 it brought together in Kazan eminent scholars of civil procedure from cities across the whole of Russia: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Saratov, Ekaterinburg, Omsk, Samara, Nizhnekamsk and others. This large-scale event attracted the attention not only of Russian scholars, but also of legal scholars from abroad: Elisabetta Silvestri (Professor, University of Pavia, Italy), William B. Simons (Professor, University of Tartu, Estonia), Jaroslav Turlukovsky (Professor, Warsaw University, Poland), Stuart H. Schultz (Practising Attorney, USA), Irina Izarova (Associate Professor, Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, Ukraine). The opening ceremony of the Symposium began with greetings to all participants and best wishes for productive discussions. Participants were welcomed with remarks by Marat Khairullin, Deputy Chair of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Tatarstan, Radik Ilyasov, Head of the Federal Bailiff Service of the Republic of Tatarstan, and Ildar Tarkhanov, Academic Supervisor at the Faculty of Law. They expressed their appreciation for the great value {{of the journal}} Herald of Civil Procedure in the growth of the science of civil procedure and <b>enforcement</b> <b>procedure,</b> and for its contributions {{to the development of}} the judicial system of the Russian Federation. In addition to hearing prepared reports and discussing viewpoints on current issues of civil and arbitration procedure, participants attended presentations by representatives from procedural law periodicals in the frame of the Symposium. The Editor-in-Chief of Herald of Civil Procedure, Damir Valeev, and the Commercial Director of the Statut Publishing House (Moscow), Kirill Samoilov, presented new books in the series ‘Classics of Civil Procedure,’ which is a joint publication of the University and Statut. Editors of law periodicals noted this great event, too. Professor Vladimir Gureev introduced the first publication of the new scientific and practical journal Herald of <b>Enforcement</b> <b>Procedure</b> and Professor Dmitry Maleshin presented the new book Eurasian civil procedure: the 25 th anniversary of the CIS and Baltic countries.
