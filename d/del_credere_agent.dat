50|$|A <b>Del</b> <b>Credere</b> <b>Agent</b> {{not only}} {{establishes}} a {{privity of contract}} between the principal and the third party, but who also guarantees to the principal the due performance of the contract by the third party. The agent is liable, however, only when the third party fails {{to carry out their}} contract, e.g., by insolvency. The agent is not liable to the principal if the third party refuses to carry out the contract, for example if the buyer refuses to take delivery.|$|E
5000|$|Neither {{does the}} statute {{apply to the}} promise of a <b>del</b> <b>credere</b> <b>agent</b> to make no sales on behalf of his {{principal}} except to persons who are absolutely solvent, and renders the agent liable for any loss that may result from the non-fulfilment of his promise. A promise to give a guarantee is within the statute, though not one to procure a guarantee. The general principles which determine what are guarantees within the statute of frauds are: (1) the primary liability of a third person must exist or be contemplated; (2) the promise must be made to the creditor; (3) there must be no liability by the surety independent of an express promise of guarantee; (4) the main object of the parties to the guarantee must be the fulfilment of a third party's obligation; and (5) the contract entered into must not amount to a sale by the creditor to the promiser of the security for a debt or of the debt itself ...|$|E
5000|$|... a {{patentee}} utilizes {{the sales}} organization of another business—a business {{with which he}} has no intimate relationship—quite different problems are posed, since such a regimentation of a marketing system is peculiarly susceptible to the restraints of trade which the Sherman Act condemns. And when it is clear, {{as it is in}} this case, that the marketing systems utilized by means of the del credere agency agreements are those of competitors of the patentee, and that the purpose is to fix prices at which the competitors may market the product, the device is, without more, an enlargement of the limited patent privilege and a violation of the Sherman Act. In such a case, the patentee exhausts his limited privilege when he disposes of the product to the <b>del</b> <b>credere</b> <b>agent.</b> He then has, so far as the Sherman Act is concerned, no greater rights to price maintenance than the owner of an unpatented commodity would have.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Del</b> <b>credere</b> <b>agents</b> {{sell their}} principals’ goods and {{undertake}} to indemnify their principals {{in the event}} of the purchaser breaching the contract. This undertaking commonly entails guaranteeing payment of the purchase price.|$|R
5000|$|The Court {{then turned}} to the {{argument}} that the 1926 General Electric decision saved the arrangement from the antitrust laws. The Court did [...] "not agree that the 'agency' device saved the arrangement from the Sherman Act." [...] To be sure. del credereagency is a useful commercial device. [...] "But, however useful it may be in allocating risks between the parties and determining their rights inter se, its terms do not necessarily control when the rights of others intervene, whether they be creditors or the sovereign." [...] Even assuming [...] "that the agreements constituted the appellees as <b>del</b> <b>credere</b> <b>agents</b> of Masonite," [...] the Court insisted, that [...] "does not prevent the arrangement from running afoul of the Sherman Act." [...] because a patent owner [...] "cannot extend his statutory grant by contract or agreement" [...] and a patent [...] "affords no immunity for a monopoly not fairly or plainly within the grant." [...] Here, the agency agreements were used to fix the prices at which the [...] "agents" [...] disposed of the goods to their customers. Once the patented product [...] "passes to the hands of the purchaser, it is no longer within the limits of the patent monopoly. It passes outside of it, and is no longer under the protection of" [...] the patent law. [...] "In applying that rule, this Court has quite consistently refused to allow the form into which the parties chose to cast the transaction to govern." [...] Here, the form of the transaction is <b>del</b> <b>credere</b> agency, but in fact the other defendants operate their businesses on their own, not as Masonite's agents, and the purpose of the arrangement is to put together a combination among competitors to fix prices: ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of United States v. Masonite Corp., 316 U.S. 265 (1942), the U.S. Supreme Court {{evaluated}} the antitrust status of use of a <b>del</b> <b>credere</b> agency business structure. Such an arrangement often may, {{as it did in}} the Masonite case, involve the principal’s fixing the price at which the agent sells the goods that the principal supplies it. The Supreme Court held that, although the parties’ agency agreement could be assumed genuine rather than sham, use of <b>del</b> <b>credere</b> agency does not necessarily insulate the firms from antitrust liability.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>del</b> <b>credere</b> ( [...] ; Italian for [...] "belief" [...] or [...] "trust") agent, in English law, is one who, selling {{goods for}} their {{principal}} on credit, undertakes {{for an additional}} commission to sell only to persons who are absolutely solvent. The agent's position is thus that of a surety who is liable to the principal should the purchaser make default. The agreement between agent and principal need {{not be reduced to}} or evidenced by writing, for the undertaking is not a guarantee within the Statute of Frauds (29 Car 2 c 3).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} constitutionally mandated funds for financing regional development in Brazil and the regional financial institutions that manage them. These constitutionally mandated funds apply a fraction of federal tax revenues in the productive sectors of the North, Northeast and Midwest regions of Brazil. We investigate the occurrence of soft budget constraint on these institutions, induced by compensatory mechanisms for management of the resources of these funds (administration fee) and by the assumption of credit risk in lending (<b>del</b> <b>credere).</b> The concept of soft budget constraint, proposed by Hungarian economist Janos Kornai {{in the context of}} socialist economies, refers to the expectations for systematic bailout of economic organizations by governments or banks, usually associated with the paternalistic role of the state towards these organizations. Our analysis uses comparative graphics and spreadsheets. The results indicate more remuneration than administrative costs and credit risk assumed by financial institutions and confirm the hypothesis of legal parameters that induce soft budget constraint...|$|R
5000|$|The Court {{began by}} observing, [...] "But for Masonite's patents and the <b>del</b> <b>credere</b> agency {{agreements}} {{there can be}} no doubt that this is a price-fixing combination which is illegal per se under the Sherman Act." [...] That was true despite the district court's findings that in negotiating and entering into the first agreement, each of the defendants, other than Masonite, [...] "acted independently of the others, negotiated only with Masonite, desired the agreement regardless of the action that might be taken by any of the others, did not require as a condition of its acceptance that Masonite make such an agreement with any of the others, and had no discussions with any of the others." [...] The reason that was so was that here, as the Court said in Interstate Circuit, [...] "It was enough that, knowing that concerted action was contemplated and invited, the distributors gave their adherence to the scheme and participated in it." [...] The circumstances left [...] "no room for doubt that all had an awareness of the general scope and purpose of the undertaking." ...|$|R
