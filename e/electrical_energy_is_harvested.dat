In this work, an electromechanically coupled finite element model is combined with an unsteady aerodynamic model to develop a piezoaeroelastic model for airflow excitation of cantilevered plates representing wing-like structures. The electrical power output and the displacement of the wing tip are investigated for several airflow speeds and two different electrode configurations (continuous and segmented). Cancelation of electrical output occurs for typical coupled bending-torsion aeroelastic modes of a cantilevered generator wing when continuous electrodes are used. Torsional motions of the coupled modes become relatively significant when segmented electrodes are used, improving the broadband performance and altering the flutter speed.

40|$|The {{classical}} electrokinetic {{energy conversion}} mechanism {{relies on a}} single stage conversion by forcing liquid through a channel with charged walls. When the net charges inside the electrical double layer (EDL) are transported by water flow, the produced <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> can <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> via connection of electrodes at two ends of a channel. By introducing gas bubbles, the internal electrical resistance of the system can be increased, decreasing the conduction current. Following this approach, experimentally we achieved over 163 times efficiency increase compared with single water phase flow. However, the absolute efficiency is still quite low due to ions conduction in the liquid filled corner of microchannel. The microjet system was then used. The water droplets, broke from liquid jet, are absolutely isolated by air. It operates entirely different with traditional energy conversion from streaming potential, hence we term it “ballistic energy conversion”. Conversion occurs in two stages: first pressure is converted to kinetic energy and subsequently kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> converted to <b>electrical</b> <b>energy.</b> In the first stage a stream of high-velocity high-charge droplets is produced by forcing water through a micropore. In the second stage the charged droplets travel through an electrical field towards a high-potential target, decelerating them to zero speed. The target acquires its potential by droplet impact. Current is drawn from the target to do useful work. We strongly reduced loss factors by optimizing the setup from the physical model.
