40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a balloon pump with <b>floating</b> <b>valves</b> {{to control the}} {{discharge}} flow rates of sample solutions. Because the <b>floating</b> <b>valves</b> were made from a photoreactive resin, {{the shapes of the}} <b>floating</b> <b>valves</b> could be controlled by employing different exposure patterns without any change in the pump configurations. Owing to the simple preparation process of the pump, we succeeded in changing the discharge flow rates in accordance with the number and length of the <b>floating</b> <b>valves.</b> Because our methods could be used to easily prepare balloon pumps with arbitrary discharge properties, we achieved several microfluidic operations by the integration of the balloon pumps with microfluidic devices. Therefore, we believe that the balloon pump with <b>floating</b> <b>valves</b> will be a useful driving component for portable microfluidic systems...|$|R
40|$|Piston {{pumps are}} {{difficult}} to match to windmills. In first approximation the pump demands a constant torque for all rotational speeds. For this reason the combination of windmill and pump reaches its maximum performance for a single windspeed called the design windspeed. At standstill the mill only starts running when the windspeed is higher than about 1. 5 the design windspeed. It stops only when the windspeed drops below V which {{is lower than the}} design windsp~~ 8 ~ In the intermediate region the windmill is sometimes running, sometimes standing still. By this fact the overall efficiency is lower than can be expected theoretically. The introduction of start helps can improve the start behaviour considerably. A newly developed start help i. e. the <b>floating</b> <b>valve</b> is presented in this paper. A simple theoretical model of the <b>floating</b> <b>valve</b> is given, which is in fair agreement with the performed experiments. The pump with <b>floating</b> <b>valve</b> was tested under laboratory conditions as well as under field conditions. Comparison of the performance of a mill equipped with a normal pump and a pump with a <b>floating</b> <b>valve</b> showed an improved start behaviour and a 60 % increased overall efficiency...|$|R
5000|$|Between 1935 and 1938, {{the company}} {{introduced}} {{a long list}} of valve and thermostat products, including automatic spring <b>valves,</b> ball <b>float</b> <b>valves,</b> pressure-controlled valves, diaphragm valves, suction valves, constant-pressure valves, room thermostats and drying filters. A logo reading [...] "Danfoss"—a portmanteau of the Danish words [...] "Danmark" [...] (Denmark) and [...] "fosser" [...] (to stream or sparkle)—was attached to all valves.|$|R
5000|$|Cold water cisterns, {{where the}} <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> outlet must be above the {{overflow}} water level. The previous practice {{of taking a}} [...] "silencing tube" [...] from the <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> to under the water level is no longer acceptable. Under some plumbing codes. such silencing may still be acceptable {{if it is a}} soft collapsible tube which cannot syphon.|$|E

Down-hole equipment such as Centralizers and Turbolizers are used to ensure obtaining satisfactory zone isolation.

25|$|The {{use of the}} {{centrifugal}} governor by James Watt in 1788 to regulate the speed of his steam engine was one factor leading to the Industrial Revolution. Steam engines also use <b>float</b> <b>valves</b> and pressure release valves as mechanical regulation devices. A mathematical analysis of Watt's governor was done by James Clerk Maxwell in 1868.|$|R
50|$|Lone Chimney Lake {{has been}} plagued by drought-related {{problems}} for nearly a decade. It was nearly drained of municipal water in 2006, when high consumption caused the fixed intake valve to be above the lake's surface. It had to be replaced with a <b>floating</b> <b>valve.</b> The cost was about $19,000, but allowed the lake management to continue supplying its customers.|$|R

50|$|The main item in {{the room}} is the {{sanitation}} fixture itself, the toilet. This may be the flushing sort, which is plumbed into a cistern (tank) operated by a ballcock (<b>float</b> <b>valve).</b> Or it may be a dry model, which does not need water.|$|E

5000|$|Modern designs use {{silicone}} rubber in the mouthpiece and one-way clearing and <b>float</b> <b>valves</b> {{due to its}} resistance to degradation and its long service life. Natural rubber was formerly used, but slowly oxidizes and breaks down due to ultraviolet light exposure from the sun. It eventually loses its flexibility, becomes brittle and cracks, which can cause clearing valves to stick in the open or closed position, and <b>float</b> <b>valves</b> to leak due to {{a failure of the}} valve seat to seal. In even older designs, some snorkels were made with small [...] "ping pong" [...] balls in a cage mounted to the open end of the tube to prevent water ingress. These are no longer sold or recommended because they are unreliable and considered hazardous. Similarly, diving masks with a built-in snorkel are considered unsafe by scuba diving organisations such as PADI, BSAC because they can engender {{a false sense of security}} and can be difficult to clear if flooded.|$|R
50|$|Stiffer {{valve springs}} {{can help prevent}} <b>valve</b> <b>float</b> and <b>valve</b> bounce, but only {{at the expense of}} {{increased}} friction losses and higher stresses in the valvetrain. Various techniques have been used to offset the effect of stiffer springs, such as dual-spring and progressive-sprung valves, roller-tipped tappets, and pneumatic valve springs.|$|R
50|$|Mercury {{is used in}} thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, <b>float</b> <b>valves,</b> mercury switches, {{and other}} devices though {{concerns}} about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alcohol-filled, galinstan-filled, digital, or thermistor-based instruments. It remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam material for dental restoration. It is used in lighting: electricity passed through mercury vapor in a phosphor tube produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor to fluoresce, making visible light.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{ballcock}} or <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> {{is often}} used to regulate the filling of a tank or cistern. When the fluid level drops, the float descends, levering the valve opening and allowing more fluid to enter. Once the float reached the 'full' position, the arm presses the valve shut again.|$|E
50|$|The valve {{is often}} {{described}} as a needle valve, although this is a misnomer. A true needle valve uses a tapered needle in a tapered seat, so as to provide fine control over flow rate. The <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> uses a pointed needle against a square-edged seat, to give a positive shut-off.|$|E
50|$|Construction is of {{the usual}} cast brass housing for {{plumbing}} parts, with a threaded connection to the pipework at the base. The top has a small outlet, usually hidden beneath a plastic dust cap. Internally {{there is a large}} hollow body, normally filled with water, and containing a <b>float</b> <b>valve.</b> The valve must always be installed vertically, usually {{at the top of a}} short vertical pipe.|$|E
5000|$|A {{proportional}} control {{system is a}} type of linear feedback control system. Two classic mechanical examples are the toilet bowl <b>float</b> proportioning <b>valve</b> and the fly-ball governor.|$|R
25|$|An early {{scientific}} study of mercury poisoning was in 1923–6 by the German inorganic chemist, Alfred Stock, who himself became poisoned, together with his colleagues, by breathing mercury vapor that was being released by his laboratory equipment—diffusion pumps, <b>float</b> <b>valves,</b> and manometers—all of which contained mercury, and also from mercury that had been accidentally spilt and remained in cracks in the linoleum floor covering. He published {{a number of papers}} on mercury poisoning, founded a committee in Berlin to study cases of possible mercury poisoning, and introduced the term micromercurialism.|$|R
2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} legend, Sir Thomas Crapper did not invent the flush toilet. He was, however, in the {{forefront}} of the industry in the late 19th century, and held nine patents, three of them for water closet improvements such as the floating ballcock. His flush toilets were designed by inventor Albert Giblin, who received a British patent for the [...] "Silent Valveless Water Waste Preventer", a siphon discharge system. Crapper popularized the siphon system for emptying the tank, replacing the earlier <b>floating</b> <b>valve</b> system which was prone to leaks.|$|R
50|$|The {{water level}} in the {{condensate}} tank was controlled by a <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> which opened to replenish it from the fresh water tank {{as soon as the}} water level dropped to below 400 imp gal and automatically closed again as soon as that level was reached again. To provide for any malfunction in the water supply, a hand-operated stop cock was provided on the fresh water tank.|$|E
5000|$|Note {{that the}} <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> of a {{carburettor}} (controlling {{the fuel level}} within the carburettor) is not a needle valve, although it is commonly described as one. It uses a bluntly conical needle, but it seats against a square-edged seat rather than a matching cone. The intention here is to obtain a well-defined seat between two narrow mating surfaces, giving firm shutoff of the flow from only a light float pressure.|$|E
50|$|The rooftop water towers store 25000 to 50000 L {{of water}} {{until it is}} needed in the {{building}} below. The upper portion of water is skimmed off the top for everyday use while {{the water in the}} bottom of the tower is held in reserve to fight fire. When the water drops below a certain level, a pressure switch, level switch or <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> will activate a pump or open a public water line to refill the water tower.|$|E

40|$|A valve {{actuation}} device. The device {{may include}} a free <b>floating</b> <b>valve</b> bridge movably supported within a cavity {{in the engine}} housing. The bridge may be provided with a cavity and an orifice arrangement for pumping gases entrained with lubricating fluid toward the piston stems as the bridge reciprocates back and forth. The device may also include a rocker arm that has a U-shaped cross-sectional shape for receiving at least {{a portion of the}} valve bridge, valve stem valve spring and spring retainer therein. The rocker arm may be provided with lubrication passages for directing lubrication to the point wherein it is pivotally affixed to the engine housing...|$|R
50|$|Drum style (bypass) uses a pipe {{to bring}} water {{directly}} to a reservoir (a pan) attached to the furnace. The water level in the pan is controlled by a <b>float</b> <b>valve,</b> similar to a small toilet tank float. The wick is typically a foam pad mounted on a drum and attached to a small motor; hot air enters the drum {{at one end and}} is forced to leave through the sides of the drum. When the hygrostat calls for humidity, the motor is turned on causing the drum to rotate slowly through the pan of water and preventing the foam pad from drying out.|$|E
50|$|The {{phenomenon}} is {{also referred to}} as 'after-run', or 'run-on' or sometimes dieseling, when it causes the engine to carry on running after the ignition is shut off. This effect is more readily achieved on carbureted gasoline engines, because the fuel supply to the carburetor is typically regulated by a passive mechanical <b>float</b> <b>valve</b> and fuel delivery can feasibly continue until fuel line pressure has been relieved, provided the fuel can be somehow drawn past the throttle plate. The occurrence is rare in modern engines with throttle-body or electronic fuel injection, because the injectors will not be permitted to continue delivering fuel after the engine is shut off, and any occurrence may indicate the presence of a leaking (failed) injector.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} {{is illustrated in}} the diagram. When reservoir G is lowered, bulb B and tube T are filled with gas from the enclosure being evacuated (through tube A). When G is raised, mercury rises in tube F and cuts off the gas in B and T at C. This gas is then forced through the mercury in tube D into the atmosphere. The end of tube D is bent upward at E to facilitate collection of gas (or vapor). By alternately raising G, a pumping action results. Clearly tubes F and D must be long enough to support mercury columns corresponding to atmospheric pressure (76 cm at sea level). Instead of using mercury to provide a valving action at C, {{it is possible to}} use a glass <b>float</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E

5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates {{from side to side}} to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above {{the surface of the water}} when the animal is <b>floating.</b> <b>Valves</b> seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|R
500|$|Mercury {{is used in}} thermometers, barometers, manometers, sphygmomanometers, <b>float</b> <b>valves,</b> mercury switches, mercury relays, {{fluorescent}} lamps and other devices, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and sphygmomanometers being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as alcohol- or galinstan-filled glass thermometers and thermistor- or infrared-based electronic instruments. [...] Likewise, mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury sphygmomanometers. Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam for dental restoration in some locales. It is used in fluorescent lighting. Electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce, making visible light.|$|R
