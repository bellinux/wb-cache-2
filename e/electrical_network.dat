5|$|The {{earliest}} {{research into}} thinking machines {{was inspired by}} a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an <b>electrical</b> <b>network</b> of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon's information theory described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that {{it might be possible to}} construct an electronic brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear <b>electrical</b> <b>network</b> consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E

The storm damaged about 75% of the <b>electrical</b> <b>network</b> was damaged, which also disrupted water supply on the island, and about 30% of roads were damaged. Over 90% of the cropson the island were destroyed, with many livestock killed.

The species had regrown from a minimum of around 70 in 1971, and the trend toward regrowth continued after the storm, reaching about 3,500 in 2002. The storm also affected the Rodrigues warbler. The storm also injured nine people, and overall, Bella was considered the worst storm on the island in 20years.|$|E

Unusually, the landing gear was steerable, the Sperrin being one of the first British aircraft to be fitted with this feature; operation of the landing gear, along with various other pieces of onboard equipment, was achieved via the onboard Messier hydraulic system.

25|$|Power {{engineering}} {{deals with}} the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity {{as well as the}} design of a range of related devices. These include transformers, electric generators, electric motors, high voltage engineering, and power electronics. In many regions of the world, governments maintain an <b>electrical</b> <b>network</b> called a power grid that connects a variety of generators together with users of their energy. Users purchase electrical energy from the grid, avoiding the costly exercise of having to generate their own. Power engineers may work on the design and maintenance of the power grid as well as the power systems that connect to it. Such systems are called on-grid power systems and may supply the grid with additional power, draw power from the grid, or do both. Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid, called off-grid power systems, which in some cases are preferable to on-grid systems. The future includes Satellite controlled power systems, with feedback in real time to prevent power surges and prevent blackouts.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} {{the structure of}} electrical Lie algebras of finite Dynkin type. These Lie algebras were introduced by Lam-Pylyavskyy {{in the study of}} circular planar <b>electrical</b> <b>networks.</b> Among these <b>electrical</b> Lie algebras, the Lie group corresponding to type A electrical Lie algebra acts on such networks via some combinatorial operations studied by Curtis-Ingerman-Morrow and Colin de Verdi`ere-Gitler-Vertigan. Lam-Pylyavskyy studied the type A electrical Lie algebra of even rank in detail, and gave a conjecture for the dimension of electrical Lie algebras of finite Dynkin types. We prove this conjecture for all classical Dynkin types, that is, A, B, C, and D. Furthermore, we are able to explicitly describe the structure of some electrical Lie algebras of classical types as the semisimple product of the symplectic Lie algebra with its finite dimensional irreducible representations. We then introduce mirror symmetric circular planar <b>electrical</b> <b>networks</b> as the mirror symmetric subset of circular planar <b>electrical</b> <b>networks</b> studied by Curtis-Ingerman-Morrow [CIM] and Colin de Verdi`ere-Gitler-Vertigan [dVGV]. These mirror symmetric networks can be viewed as the type B generalization of circular planar <b>electrical</b> <b>networks.</b> We show that most of the properties of circular planar <b>electrical</b> viii <b>networks</b> are well inherited by these mirror symmetric <b>electrical</b> <b>networks.</b> In particular, the type B electrical Lie algebra has an infinitesimal action on such networks. Inspired by Lam [Lam], the space of mirror symmetric circular planar electrical net- works can be compactified using mirror symmetric cactus networks, which admit a stratification indexed by mirror symmetric matchings on [4 n]. The partial order on the mirror symmetric matchings emerging from mirror symmetric <b>electrical</b> <b>networks</b> is dual to a subposet of affine Bruhat order of type C. We conjecture that this partial order is the closure partial order of the stratification of mirror symmetric cactus networks...|$|R
