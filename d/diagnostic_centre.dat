40|$|Within cancer epidemiology, {{patients}} are not assigned randomly to <b>diagnostic</b> <b>centres</b> (hospitals). The stage of disease at diagnosis also affects prognosis. Survival {{and the impact}} of associated risk factors may vary according to both place of diagnosis (hospital) and stage at diagnosis. To address these issues we use latent class analysis (LCA). We use a dataset of patients in a large UK regional population diagnosed as having colorectal cancer. We choose to model the outcome as two-year survival (alive / dead) for ease of comparison with other studies and reports. A problem arises from the hierarchical nature of such datasets, since {{patients are}} clustered by <b>diagnostic</b> <b>centres</b> that are not strictly a random sample. Consequently, standard multilevel modelling may be inappropriate. Another issue is that standard regression models give rise to biased results when model covariates are measured with error or have missing values, and this bias is exacerbated within product interaction terms [1]. Since stage is measured with uncertainty and suffers a large degree of missingness, considering it as a covariate and exploring it in interactions with risk factors has the potential to introduce large bias. Bias may also arise where covariates (such as stage) lie on the causal path, due to th...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study in}} Pakistan {{aimed to develop}} an {{improved}} record-keeping mechanism for the DOTS programme to establish the final treatment status of patients recorded as “transferred-out”. In an intervention study in 40 DOTS <b>diagnostics</b> <b>centres</b> in Punjab province, a modification was made to the existing TB 03 register. DOTS facilitators were trained to keep proper records of patients who transferred-out and transferred-in. Among 4442 registered cases, 104 patients (2. 3 %) transferred out of reporting centres. Correct matching of “-out and-in” patients was achieved for 74 (71. 2 %) patients; the remaining 30 (28. 8 %) were untraced. By tracing transferred-ou...|$|R
