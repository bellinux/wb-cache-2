50|$|The Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas), {{also known}} as jumbo squid, <b>jumbo</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squid,</b> pota, or diablo rojo, is a large, predatory squid living {{in the waters of}} the Humboldt Current in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

40|$|Dosidicus gigas, {{the only}} {{species in the}} genus Dosidicus, is {{commonly}} known as the jumbo squid, <b>jumbo</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squid</b> (FAO, see Roper et al., 1984), or Humboldt squid. It is the largest ommastrephid squid and is endemic to the Eastern Pacific, ranging from northern California to southern Chile and to 140 oW at the equator (Nesis, 1983; Nigmatullin, et al., 2001). During the last two decades it has become an extremely important fisheries resource in the Gulf of California (Ehrhardt et al., 1983; Morales-Bojórquez et al., 2001), around the Costa Rica Dome (Ichii et al., 2002) and off Peru (Taipe et al., 2001). It is also an active predator that undoubtedly has an important impact on local ecology in areas where it is abundant (Ehrhardt et al., 1983; Nesis, 1983; Nigmatullin et al., 2001; Markaida and Sosa-Nishizaki, 2003) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} and abundance {{of the fleet}} targeting <b>Jumbo</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squid</b> (Dosidicus gigas) in the Eastern Pacific is examined during the 1999 fishery season. The commercial fishery consists of a multinational jigging fleet, which fish at night using powerful lights to attract squid. The emission of light from these vessels can be observed using satellite-derived imagery obtained by the United States Defence Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS). In order to quantify fishing effort using lights, data on the {{distribution and}} abundance of vessels were obtained via satellite tracking using the ARGOS system. The distribution of the fishery as derived from light signatures was found to closely resemble that derived from ship location data. By using ARGOS data to calibrate DMSP-OLS images, {{we are able to}} estimate fishing effort in terms of the ‘area illuminated’ by the fishing fleet.

Satellite imagery of the light-fishing fleet revealed fishing grounds to be situated off the coast of Peru (2 to 10 °S), with fishing on the high seas observed off both Peru (3 to 18 °S), and Central America (5 to 10 °N). The distribution of the fleet was not associated with bathymetry or proximity to coastal regions, but is likely to be linked to upwelling events in the Eastern Pacific. DMSP-OLS data can be used to provide synoptic imagery of the fleet for time periods from a single day to several years, and enables the study of fleet activity across management and political boundaries...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>Jumbo</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squid</b> Dosidicus gigas has a {{short life}} span and {{is subject to}} rapid changes in {{population}} size. This species inhabits the Eastern Pacific, {{one of the most}} variable oceanic environments in the world, subject to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This study examined the influence of environmental variability on squid abundance off Peru using mesoscale oceanographic indicators derived from remotely sensed satellite imagery. In the fishery area off Peru, squid abundance was positively associated with sea surface temperatures (SST) between 17 and 22 °C during July, corresponding to the peak of the fishery season. In the putative hatching area close to the Costa Rica Dome, squid abundance was positively associated with SST of between 24 and 28 °C during September, {{prior to the start of}} the fishery season. Squid abundance is apparently strongly influenced by mesoscale variability linked to ENSO, with low levels of upwelling during the very strong El Niño of 1997 to 1998 leading to very low catches of squid off Peru. Variability in upwelling off Peru and in the Costa Rica Dome region may drive primary and secondary production and transport processes affecting the planktonic early life stages and also the availability of food and suitable habitat for adult squid...|$|E

40|$|Dosidicus gigas (the <b>jumbo</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squid)</b> {{supports}} a major fishery {{in the eastern}} Pacific Ocean and exhibits large fluctuations in abundance from year to year. The commercial fishery consists of a multinational jigging fleet and the emission of light from these vessels can be observed using satellite-derived imagery obtained by the United States Defence Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS). Fishery abundance and fleet distribution were examined in Peruvian waters during years of intermediate (1994), La Niña (1996), and El Niño (1997) conditions, and compared with catch data {{from other parts of}} the species range (to the north and south of Peru). Squid catches off Peru were highest under intermediate conditions, with lower catch levels recorded during periods of cool or warm temperature anomalies. The fishery was distributed between 3 ° and 16 °S in both coastal and high seas waters, over depths of greater than 1000 m. Unusually cool or warm conditions may cause a reduction in the abundance of squid off the coast of Peru, with catches increasing in other parts of the species range, notably off the coast of Central America (close to the Costa Rica Dome) and in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Squid fishing took place in waters with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) between 17 and 22 °C, but SST was not directly associated with fleet distribution. It is likely that variability in upwelling strength and the occurrence of cool core mesoscale oceanographic features are important in influencing the distribution of D. gigas in Peruvian waters...|$|E
40|$|The <b>jumbo</b> <b>flying</b> <b>squid</b> Dosidicus gigas {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the eastern Pacific Ocean and supports an important fishery. Although many studies {{have been carried out}} on the biology of this species, limited biological information is available in the waters outside the Exclusive Economic Zone of Chile (EEZ) (20 °S- 41 °S and 74 ° 30 ’W- 84 °W). Three surveys were conducted in this area by the Chinese squid jigging vessels during the period from April 2006 to May 2008. The majority of the catch in the survey was from the two areas defined by 37 ° 30 ’- 41 °S and 78 ° 30 ’- 80 °W and by 25 °- 30 °S and 76 °- 77 ° 30 ’W. The sex ratio (M: F) of the catch was 1 : 2. 48. The mean mantle length (ML) was 376 mm for males with a range of 257 - 721 mm and 388. 7 mm for females with a range of 236 - 837 mm. Two distinguished size classes, medium- and large-sized groups, were identified in this study with the medium-sized group (350 - 450 mm ML) consisting of 89 % of the total catch. The sizes at first sexual maturity were 638 mm ML for females and 565 mm ML for males. This study suggests that all the individuals examined were hatched from March 2007 to February 2008, indicating that D. gigas might spawn all year around with a peak spawning time from November 2007 to January 2008. Most of the stomachs analyzed had food remains. The preys included three major groups: fish (mainly lanternfish), cephalopods and crustaceans, but D. gigas was the dominant species in the stomach contents, showing strong evidence of cannibalism. The information obtained from this study improves our understanding of the fishery biology of D. gigas off Chile...|$|E
