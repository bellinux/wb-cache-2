5|$|A similar {{suggestion}} {{holds the}} 21,636-year precession cycles solely responsible.

It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> ice built up over several precession cycles, only melting after four or five such cycles.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the {{surviving}} source material is of questionable reliability. The two witnesses who gave evidence, Robert Stubbs and James Kelsall, were strongly motivated to exonerate themselves from blame. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the figures concerning {{the number of}} slaves killed, {{the amount of water}} that remained on the ship, and the distance beyond Jamaica that Zong had mistakenly sailed are inaccurate.|$|E

5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|An Anglo-Saxon {{spearhead}} {{was found}} in July 1962 by D. Tamkin in a cutting through a natural knoll of sand on Messrs Reed's playing fields at Cobdown, Ditton.

5|$|As European-introduced {{diseases}} and raids by Peruvian slavers, including a final devastating raid in 1862 and a subsequent smallpox epidemic, had reduced the Rapa Nui population to under two hundred by the 1870s, it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> literacy had {{been wiped out}} by the time Eyraud discovered the tablets in 1866.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} sibling of Nyuserre is known with near-certainty: Neferefre, {{who was a}} son of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II, was Nyuserre's elder brother. Since the {{relation}} between Shepseskare and Nyuserre remains uncertain, it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> the two were brothers too, as suggested by Roth, although the dominant hypothesis is that Shepseskare was a son of Sahure and hence Nyuserre's uncle.|$|E

5|$|Generally {{when two}} or more rats from the same litter are {{of the same sex}} they live {{together}} with no disruptions but with the occasional friendly tussle and play fight.

Several measures have to be taken to provide security for both rats.|$|E
5|$|Giselle {{was first}} staged in Italy at Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 17 January 1843. The music however was not Adam's {{but that of}} Niccolò Bajetti.
