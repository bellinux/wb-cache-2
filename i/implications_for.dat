5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and gallium in pellet form added to {{water can be}} used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and {{does not need to be}} transported.|$|E

5|$|Gomułka's thaw {{was caused}} by several factors. The death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 and the {{resulting}} de-Stalinization and the Khrushchev Thaw prompted debates about fundamental issues throughout the entire Eastern Bloc.

5|$|Historically, {{attachment}} theory {{had significant}} policy <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> hospitalized or institutionalized children, {{and those in}} poor quality daycare. Controversy remains over whether non-maternal care, particularly in group settings, has deleterious effects on social development. It is plain from research that poor quality care carries risks but that those who experience good quality alternative care cope well although {{it is difficult to}} provide good quality, individualized care in group settings.|$|E

5|$|In Norse mythology, the Æsir–Vanir War was a {{conflict}} between two groups of deities that ultimately resulted in the unification of the Æsir and the Vanir into a single pantheon.

5|$|Non-fatal {{violence}} against women has severe <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> women’s physical, mental and reproductive health, and is seen as not simply isolated events but rather a systematic pattern of behaviour that both violates their rights but also limits their role in society and requires a systematic approach.|$|E
5|$|Pink-flowering {{populations have}} a {{relatively}} distinct genetic makeup, whereas red or white flowering populations have more evident sharing of genetic traits. Research based on DNA profiling has revealed substantial genetic diversity within and between flower colour races and site populations.

5|$|The {{decision}} {{may have}} important <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> other disputes {{relating to the}} extent of executive power and the unitary executive theory.

5|$|A catastrophic injury such as SCI puts {{strain on}} marriages and other romantic relationships, {{which in turn}} has {{important}} <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> quality of life. Partners of injured people often feel out of control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with responsibilities like parenting, and loss of wages. Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.|$|E

5|$|Current {{knowledge}} on genetic diversity is fragmentary {{and the total}} number of archaeal species cannot be estimated with any accuracy. Estimates of the number of phyla range from 18 to 23, of which only 8 have representatives that have been cultured and studied directly. Many of these hypothesized groups are known from a single rRNA sequence, indicating that the diversity among these organisms remains obscure. The Bacteria also contain many uncultured microbes with similar <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> characterization.|$|E
5|$|Education of {{families}} {{is critical in}} developing strategies for understanding strengths and weaknesses; helping the family to cope improves outcomes in children.

5|$|The current {{trend of}} {{enhancing}} {{security at the}} cost of passenger and baggage handling efficiency at international airports is expected to continue in the future. This places financial burden on airports, risks the flow of servicing processes, and has <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> the privacy of passengers. International flights often require a higher level of physical security than do domestic airports, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for both.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication has <b>implications</b> <b>for</b> designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need}} to eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E
