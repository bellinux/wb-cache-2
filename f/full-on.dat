5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, <b>full-on</b> to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E
5|$|When Mardonius' raids {{disrupted}} the Allied supply chain, it forced the Allies {{to rethink their}} strategy. Rather than now moving to attack, however, they instead looked to retreat and secure their lines of communication. Despite this defensive move by the Greeks, {{it was in fact}} the chaos resulting from this retreat that finally ended the stalemate. Mardonius perceived this as a <b>full-on</b> retreat, in effect thinking that the battle was already over, and sought to pursue the Greeks. Since he did not expect the Greeks to fight, the tactical problems were no longer an issue and he tried {{to take advantage of the}} altered strategic situation he thought he had produced. Conversely, the Greeks had, inadvertently, lured Mardonius into attacking them on the higher ground and, despite being outnumbered, were thus at a tactical advantage.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012, Sea World {{applied for}} a permit to {{demolish}} the Bermuda Triangle water ride system and the interior of its show building. The Bermuda Triangle had been sitting dormant since its closure in October 2010 and had been earmarked by the park as a site for a future attraction. On 12 July 2012, Christian von Elverfeldt from Mack Rides revealed Australia would be receiving a water roller coaster in 2013; leading to speculation that Sea World might have revived its plans. Further development application filings, and reports by the Roller Coaster DataBase and the Gold Coast Bulletin, confirmed this speculation. In September 2012, Sea World asked Austrian firm Dynamic Motion Rides (DyMoRides) to develop a theming and show design concept for the yet-to-be-announced Storm Coaster. DyMoRides was ultimately contracted for the full turnkey project in April 2013. DyMoRides subsequently contracted PEL Creative for creative direction, <b>Full-On</b> Lighting for lighting design, Volume One for audio and visual effects, and Sculpt Studios for theming design.|$|E
5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food onto the table. Nocchi is seen at the dining table, holding a fork and listen to music through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath a stool, opens it, and sees a small green room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. As the girls eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses turn into the outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start dancing in the fish bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking through the small door again, only to witness {{the dining room table}} empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than <b>full-on</b> vibrancy.|$|E
25|$|Mike Rawlins was a <b>full-on</b> Trotskyite in Till Death Us Do Part. For All In The Family, CBS had {{softened}} this considerably; in the American show, Mike Stivic, though {{sympathetic to}} the leftist beliefs of the Students for a Democratic Society movement, was simply a liberal Democrat.|$|E
25|$|During the 1940 {{assault on}} France and the Low Countries, the {{division}} helped beat back an Anglo-French assault on an associated Panzer {{column in the}} hopes of relieving troops besieged in Belgium during their <b>full-on</b> retreat. Following the campaign, the division remained stationed in the region until May 1941 in an occupational capacity, when it was ordered to return to East Prussia.|$|E
25|$|NGC 6745 is an {{irregular}} spiral galaxy in Lyra {{that is at}} a distance of 208 million light-years. Several million years ago, it collided with a smaller galaxy, which created a region filled with young, hot, blue stars. Astronomers do not know if the collision was simply a glancing blow or a prelude to a <b>full-on</b> merger, which would end with the two galaxies incorporated into one larger, probably elliptical galaxy.|$|E
25|$|In his heyday {{he was a}} {{truly great}} bowler able to gain {{vigorous}} off-break from even the most docile wickets. Hearne was also able to vary his pace and bowl a fast ball that swerved {{at a time when}} the skill was not well known. He had a long run for the time and a classic, <b>full-on,</b> high action that gave him higher bounce on hard, very fast wickets than most bowlers of the 1890s. His ability to thrive on hard work was seen in the dry summer of 1896 when he bowled over 10,000 balls – a feat performed previously only by Alfred Shaw, whilst in 1898 Hearne bowled over 9000 balls in a wetter summer.|$|E
25|$|The Cultural Revolution {{ended with}} {{chairman}} Mao Zedong's death in 1976. The movement, spearheaded by Mao, caused severe {{damage to the}} country's economic and social fabric. The country was mired in poverty as economic production slowed or came to a halt. Political ideology was paramount {{in the lives of}} ordinary people as well as {{the inner workings of the}} Communist Party itself. At the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee in December 1978, Deng Xiaoping emerged as China's de facto leader. Deng launched a comprehensive program to reform the Chinese economy. Within the span of several years, the direction of the country had shifted in its entirety. The focus on ideological purity was gone, replaced by a <b>full-on</b> drive to achieve material prosperity.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, Derbyshire {{finished}} twelfth, {{though the}} following season saw Derbyshire {{back up to}} tenth place, and Bestwick with one more ten-wicket match, beating out left-hander John Hulme, who had the best single-innings tally of the team with 8/52, but no ten-wicket haul to speak of, though Arnold Warren was to hit two similar hauls and outscore Bestwick with the bat, courtesy of a brace of half-centuries. Thanks to another South African tour, Derbyshire got <b>full-on</b> experience of an international side during the 1904 season, and Bestwick was to hit an average of under 30 once again, as he and Warren spearheaded the Peakites' bowling attack, as the two players missed just a single game of the eighteen Derbyshire played throughout the season between them.|$|E
25|$|The second release {{under the}} Method of Defiance moniker was a {{compilation}} style project focusing on drum 'n' bass. Inamorata stretched the concept out, pairing Laswell’s bass {{with a different}} combination of respected jazz and world musicians and drum 'n' bass producers on each track. Artists including Herbie Hancock, John Zorn, Pharoah Sanders, Nils Petter Molvaer, Toshinori Kondo and Buckethead were paired with drum 'n' bass producers including Amit, Paradox, Submerged, Evol Intent, Fanu and Corrupt Souls. He also released a <b>full-on</b> collaboration with Finnish drum 'n' bass maestro Fanu on Ohm Resistance (US) and Karl Records (Europe), entitled Lodge, which includes contributions from Molvaer and Bernie Worrell amongst others. The concept of the group has once again morphed into a full band concept. In 2009, RareNoiseRecords released Live in Nihon, which showcased this new direction/grouping. The group now consisted of Laswell, Guy Licata, Dr. Israel, Toshinori Kondo and Bernie Worrell.|$|E
25|$|Barolo {{is a red}} Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine {{produced}} in the northern Italian region of Piedmont. It is made from the Nebbiolo grape and {{is often described as}} one of Italy's greatest wines. The zone of production extends into the communes of Barolo, Castiglione Falletto, Serralunga d'Alba and parts of the communes of Cherasco, Diano d'Alba, Grinzane Cavour, La Morra, Monforte d'Alba, Novello, Roddi, Verduno, all in the province of Cuneo, south-west of Alba. Although production codes have always stipulated that vineyards must be located on hillsides, the most recent revision of the production code released in 2010 goes further, categorically excluding valley floors, humid and flat areas, areas without sufficient sunlight, and areas with <b>full-on</b> northern exposures. Barolo is often described as having the aromas of tar and roses, and the wines are noted for their ability to age and usually take on a rust red tinge as they mature. Barolo needs to be aged for at least 38 months after the harvest before release, of which at least 18 months must be in wood. When subjected to aging of at least five years before release, the wine can be labeled a Riserva.|$|E

500|$|All four modules of the S-series were {{included}} {{as part of}} the Dungeons of Dread hardcover collection, released on March 19, 2013. Lawrence Schick wrote in the foreword: [...] "Vegepygmies and robots. What more could you need to hear? Let’s go! S3 Expedition to the Barrier Peaks was Gary in <b>full-on</b> funhouse mode, having a high old time mixing elements of Jim Ward's Gamma World with fantasy to create a rollicking and memorable AD adventure." ...|$|E
500|$|James Robinson, {{the script}} editor for Planet B {{said that one}} of the main {{advantages}} of a series such as this is that it can be set anywhere saying, [...] "One week it's westerns, one week it's <b>full-on</b> sci-fi space operas, and that's one of the nice things about the best sci-fi concepts. I think, you know, the Doctor Who's and the Quantum Leap's, you kind of get a different show each week." ...|$|E
500|$|Thom Jurek of Allmusic {{described}} the album as [...] "an {{over the top}} rage and pummelfest with all the qualities that earned the group its enormous fan base by touring and recording" [...] and that the thrash metal element [...] "rivals Slayer at their best". Rock Sound magazine reviewer Eleanor Goodman awarded the album 9 out of 10, praising the first two minutes of the opening song, [...] "Clenching the Fists of Dissent", as [...] "a <b>full-on</b> old-skool thrash attack".|$|E
500|$|Paul {{described}} the band's sound as [...] "a familiar groove, {{with a new}} sound". Blabbermouth.net reviewer Don Kaye commented [...] "with little {{of the complexity of}} Mudvayne or angularity of Nothingface and much more of the <b>full-on,</b> pedal-to-the-metal style of Vinnie Paul's previous work". However, Kaye said the songs [...] "Star" [...] and [...] "Thank You" [...] border on musical cliché. Andrew Depedro of KNAC.com stated [...] "'Alcohaulin' Ass' showcases Gray's hidden talent as an outlaw country and western-type crooner in the intro", although he thought the band's lyrics were repetitive. Hellyeah has been categorized as groove metal and heavy metal.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, at age 19, Sevigny {{relocated}} {{from her}} Connecticut hometown {{to an apartment}} in Brooklyn, {{and worked as a}} seamstress. During that time, author Jay McInerney spotted her around New York City and wrote a seven-page article about her for The New Yorker in which he dubbed her the new [...] "it girl" [...] and referred to her as one of the [...] "coolest girls in the world". She subsequently appeared on the album cover of Gigolo Aunts' 1994 recording Flippin' Out and the EP <b>Full-On</b> Bloom, as well as a Lemonheads music video which further increased her reputation in New York's early 1990s underground scene.|$|E
500|$|Their {{style is}} {{described}} by Apar as [...] "mixing heavy hard rock dynamics with a moody demeanor that never slips into <b>full-on</b> dejection." [...] Spence D. characterizes the band as [...] " [...] in delivering crunching guitars topped off with somewhat generic, angst-ridden [...] that waffle between being plaintive and aggressive" [...] with vocals that [...] " [...] {{just the right amount}} of emotion, fluctuating between contemplative subjectivity and growling anger." [...] Young felt that Breaking Benjamin is [...] "indicative of early '00s modern rock, while also now and then being more Filter-esque or technically proficient, primarily on guitar during 2002's Saturate, and from then on with bass and drums." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, it was {{announced}} that model and television presenter Scott McGregor had joined the cast of Neighbours as Detective Mark Brennan. McGregor was originally given a four-week guest contract, but this was increased to six months. McGregor said that Mark is his [...] "first decent part" [...] after appearing in bit roles in other Australian dramas, such as Underbelly. McGregor's contract was then increased again to twelve months when Mark proved popular with viewers. In December 2010, it {{was announced}} that Mark would become a regular role. McGregor told a Herald Sun reporter that he was enjoying working on Neighbours, but he did not [...] "realise how <b>full-on</b> it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Loaded's {{music has}} often been {{described}} as hard rock with elements of punk, earning comparisons to the Ramones, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed, as well as McKagan's then-former band Guns N' Roses. The band cites influences from groups such as The Rolling Stones, The Saints, Thin Lizzy, Black Flag and Fear among others. Blogcritics reviewer Chris Beaumont stated that their music [...] "is bluesy hard rock that occasionally borders on the punk side of the coin. It is simultaneously slick and raw, yet it lacks the power and fury of old school Guns N' Roses or the <b>full-on</b> force of Velvet Revolver. Regardless, there is something decidedly infectious in its stripped-down nature." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Monsters of Rock appearance, Mustaine fired Behler and Young and {{canceled}} Megadeth's scheduled Australian tour. [...] "On the road, things escalated {{from a small}} border skirmish into a <b>full-on</b> raging war", Mustaine later recalled. [...] "I {{think a lot of}} us were inconsistent [...] because of the guy we were waiting for after the show." [...] During the tour, Mustaine noticed problems developing with Behler and brought in drummer Nick Menza as Behler's drum technician. As with Samuelson, Menza was expected to take over if Behler could not continue the tour. Menza replaced Behler in 1989. Young's dismissal resulted from Mustaine's suspicions that he {{was having an affair with}} Mustaine's girlfriend, an allegation Young denied.|$|E
500|$|Christian metal is not {{a solitary}} style of music, but rather an ideological {{umbrella}} term that comprises almost every subgenre of heavy metal music. The musicians within Christian metal bands typically base their lyrics on Judeo-Christian traditions. The lyrical approach of Christian metal bands is somewhat varied, as some emphasize {{the positive aspects of}} faith matters while others iterate the teachings of Christ. Some bands keep their message hidden in metaphors. Only a minority take an aggressive attitude towards those who speak against Christianity, [...] "preaching <b>full-on</b> fire and brimstone and Old Testament style God's wrath back at extreme Satanists". References to eschatology and apocalyptic themes, particularly the ongoing spiritual warfare between good and evil as well as the Last Judgment and fall from grace are typical.|$|E
500|$|The band's second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, was {{released}} on 23 April 2007, {{a week after the}} release of accompanying single [...] "Brianstorm". Like its predecessor, Favourite Worst Nightmare also quickly reached No.1 in the album charts. Turner described the songs as [...] "very different from last time", adding that the sound of some tracks are [...] "a bit <b>full-on</b> – a bit like [...] "From the Ritz to the Rubble", [...] "The View from the Afternoon", that sort of thing." [...] A secret gig played at Sheffield's Leadmill on 10 February 2007, debuted seven new songs (six from Favourite Worst Nightmare and one other). Early reviews of the release were positive, and described it as [...] "very, very fast and very, very loud." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] was {{generally}} well received by contemporary music critics. In {{a review of}} the group's debut album Spice, Chuck Campbell of the Star-News said it is [...] "a slamming dance song". Daniel Incognito of Sputnikmusic said that with a [...] "dynamite chorus harmonising the girls voices, 'Who Do You Think You Are' still feels relevant today", he added that [...] "each girl excels in their solo-lines", and believed that Chisholm [...] "provides [...] delicious contrast with her loud and spirited lines". The Daily Mirror called the song [...] "a <b>full-on</b> disco number which would get to No. 1 even if it wasn't by Spice Girls and even if they weren't giving all the money to Comic Relief".|$|E
500|$|Anderson later {{revealed}} that Charlie and Angelo would face tough times in 2011, stating: [...] "They've had {{their fair share}} of hurdles – and there are more to come." [...] Charlie and Angelo split up and Anderson admitted she was happy that there is always drama in Charlie's love life and she added [...] "I think it's going to be <b>full-on</b> for Ms Buckton this year. But, you know, romances in Summer Bay never last." [...] Of breaking Charlie and Angelo up, Welsh said, [...] "The thinking behind that was to challenge the characters and do something a bit different." [...] He went on to explain that with characters who have been together a long time, there is a temptation to repeat storylines and the team wanted to change the dynamic between Charlie and Angelo.|$|E
500|$|In May 2012, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Party" [...] {{during her}} [...] revue in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States' entertainment resort, hotel, casino and spa, Revel. Rebecca Thomas of MTV News described the performance, [...] "For {{one of our}} favorite numbers, 'Party,' the 4 singer donned <b>full-on</b> showgirl regalia in a heady rendition that saw confetti coming from the roof and dice-shaped beach balls being tossed through the crowd as dancers in large feathered headdresses magically turned up in the aisles." [...] Both, Maura Johnston of The Village Voice and Tris McCall of New Jersey On-Line noted that the confetti should have been dropped during the first or the last song. Dan DeLuca of The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that [...] "Party" [...] was one of the [...] "beat-savvy booty-shaking workouts" [...] performed during the show.|$|E
500|$|Terri {{has been}} poorly {{received}} by critics. The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan has called her [...] "the worst thing about Glee", and the show's [...] "one big flaw". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly has described {{her as a}} [...] "shrill, lying nag", whose main function is to bring the audience down. Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times, however, has praised Gilsig's acting in the role, and stated that his hatred of the character dissipated once her fake pregnancy was exposed. He noted that: [...] "Gilsig's superb acting isn't exactly doing anything to extinguish those flames", and while he still isn't [...] "in <b>full-on</b> Team Terri uniform [...] she did at least have my attention on the sidelines, as opposed to filing my nails until halftime. Baby steps, right?" ...|$|E
500|$|Oliver and {{his team}} {{promoted}} the character by sending shirts with his image to Togo and displaying billboards in Uruguay. During the segment, Oliver encouraged viewers to use the hashtag #JeffWeCan, which trended on Twitter. He also called on viewers to upload images of the mascot to Google+ accounts so Jeff would be displayed following Google Images searches for [...] "Marlboro". A live version of Jeff appears {{at the end of}} the [...] "Tobacco" [...] segment. Sarene Leeds of The Wall Street Journal called Jeff's appearance [...] "a <b>full-on</b> Disneyland-ish nightmare" [...] and wrote: [...] "there is nothing more disturbing – or awesome – that you will see today than the sight of John Oliver dancing around a guy dressed up as a smoking, infected lung surrounded by more than a dozen children".

500|$|A Flash Flood of Colour {{opens with}} the trance-like, spoken-word {{introduction}} to [...] "System...", featuring synthesised strings, a [...] "battle cry" [...] buildup and {{an outline of}} the album's lyrical themes (metaphorically comparing Britain's economy to an eroded cliff-top house). The next track, [...] "...Meltdown", opens with a dubstep-influenced breakdown. Both songs [...] "surf a plateau musically", highlighting the album's diversity and acting as a [...] "paean to internationalist idealism". [...] "Ssssnakepit" [...] mixes jungle music [...] "fury", thrash metal guitar riffing, an electro interlude and a catchy chorus; Reynolds also noted drum-and-bass and hardcore-punk influences. [...] "Ssssnakepit" [...] focuses on partying more than politics; Reynolds said about the song, [...] "It’s hard to write positive songs with everything {{going on in the}} world, but this track is basically one <b>full-on</b> party—it's about cherishing your friendships and living compassionately." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{released}} a [...] "Country Road Version" [...] {{of the song}} on March 15, 2011, via her Twitter account. The version opens {{with the sound of}} guitars and then introduces a fuzzed-out slide guitar and harmonica wheeze, with the original disco beats replaced by restrained brush drumming and a more laid-back vibe. Once the first chorus starts, the song chugs alongside the harmonica sounds. Just before the three-minute mark, Gaga sings new lyrics, [...] "If I wanna make it country, baby, then it's OK, cuz I was born, I was born, I was born this way," [...] over a picked mandolin. According to Gil Kaufman of MTV, the song breaks into <b>full-on</b> country-rock mode, reminiscent of late-period Bon Jovi music, in the final minute.

500|$|Portal {{received}} critical acclaim, often {{earning more}} praise than either Half-Life 2: Episode Two or Team Fortress 2, two titles {{also included in}} The Orange Box. It was praised for its unique gameplay and dark, deadpan humor. Eurogamer cited that [...] "the way the game progresses from being a simple set of perfunctory tasks to a <b>full-on</b> part of the Half-Life story is absolute genius", while GameSpy noted that [...] "What Portal lacks in length, it more than makes up for in exhilaration." [...] The game was criticized for sparse environments, and both criticized and praised for its short length. Aggregate reviews for the stand-alone PC version of Portal gave the game a 90/100 through 28reviews on Metacritic. In 2011, Valve stated that Portal had sold more than four million copies through the retail versions, including the standalone game and The Orange Box, and from the Xbox Live Arcade version.|$|E

500|$|The songwriting session—held at Absolute's studio {{located on}} Tagg's Island near Chertsey—did {{not seem to}} go well at the beginning, as the duo was heavily into R music at the time, while the group {{according}} to Wilson was [...] "always very poptastic". After two sessions the duo phoned their managers {{and told them that}} the musical association between them and the group was not working. At this point, the duo heard [...] "Wannabe" [...] for the first time, Wilson remembers: [...] "We listen to it, and we didn't get it at all. It was so different to what we were doing.

[...] Kreisberg and Guggenheim also reassured fans that both episodes would not focus solely on setting up the spin-off series, and that the crossover is still Oliver Queen and Barry Allen having their own adventure. [...] "These [...] have important stuff going on for the narratives of both The Flash and Arrow," [...] said Kriesberg, while Guggenheim added: [...] "The final moments of The Flash have a pretty big jaw-dropper and we pick up those threads in Arrow.
