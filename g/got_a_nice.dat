500|$|The first parody {{recorded}} for {{the album was}} [...] "Cavity Search", a parody of U2's hit [...] "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me". The song, which recounts the horror of {{having to go to}} the dentist, features the sound of an actual dental drill. To enhance the dental theme of the song, Yankovic called in his actual dentist, who brought a real drill and a human tooth, which the two took turns drilling while recording to create a genuine sound effect. The second parody was a pastiche of TLC's hit [...] "Waterfalls" [...] called [...] "Phony Calls", about prank calls. During the bridge, a clip from The Simpsons second season episode [...] "Blood Feud" [...] is played on top of the music. Because the sound clip was from a preexisting episode, Yankovic noted that [...] "it was a pretty sweet deal for the Simpsons' voice actors – they each <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> pile of money, and they didn't even have to come to the studio!" [...] The next parody {{recorded for}} the album was [...] "Gump", a parody of [...] "Lump" [...] by The Presidents of the United States of America. The song recounts the basic plot to the 1994 film Forrest Gump about a naïve and slow-witted yet athletically prodigious native of Alabama who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of {{the latter half of the}} 20th century in the United States. [...] "Gump" [...] was released as the second single from the album, and received a video.|$|E

In the Coen Brothers 1998 motion picture The Big Lebowski, the fictional chief of police describes it thus: [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice,</b> quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet".
