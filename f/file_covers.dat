40|$|Abstract –A {{systematic}} {{procedure for}} the assessment of EC criterion 3 is proposed. The procedure is based on relating the technical requirements of criterion 3 to the knowledge and skills acquired by each student. A Top-down analysis is required to transform the qualitative technical requirements of criterion 3 to a set of quantitative measures of skills and knowledge. This set can be measured through different methods of evaluation. The results of evaluation are used to go up using bottom-up approach to see if the final goals are achieved or not. Comparison with the desired outcome of the engineering education will be used to evaluate the success of each student to achieve the goals of engineering education. The new procedure should produce an education profile which will augment the A, B, C, D and F grades or GPA of each student. A student’s education profile will consist of three files that describe the technical requirements of criterion 3. The first <b>file</b> <b>covers</b> mathematics, physics and basic science part of the education profile, the second <b>file</b> <b>covers</b> the basic engineering part of education, and the third <b>file</b> <b>covers</b> the gained knowledge and skills of the students ’ engineering field of specialty. Each file gives the required skills and knowledge of the student, and the percentage of skills and knowledge each student achieved during college. The paper discusses the top-down and bottom up concepts, and explains the details utilizing functional block diagram representation of the engineering education system. Non-technical and humanities aspects of criterion 3 should be included in a fourth file and will not be discussed in this paper...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It is very {{important}} for the whole society {{to pay attention to the}} health condition of small children. The thesis is focused on a possible effect of chemical and toxic substances which may endanger childs health every day. In every house with children there are many types of food, products, medicine, or also plants which can endanger children. According to the research (e. g. with milk, vitamin A or paracethamol) there are provable food items unsuitable for children in many cases. Also house plants or bushes commonly grown at home or at yards in pre-schools may also be a cause of health problems of small children. Another important aspect, which is often neglected by parents, is a material that the toys are made of. The second part of the thesis is devoted to the research which was carried out at the territory of Karviná region in 19 pre-schools (PS). There were two files of entities designed for the needs of the thesis. In one file there are 87 pedagogical workers who are employed in pre-schools. The second <b>file</b> <b>covers</b> 155 parents whose children attend randomly selected pre-schools. Both parents and pedagogical workers were asked similar questions in the form of questionnaire, which are related to the information from the area of civilian protection. The main topic here was the danger of hazardous chemical substances release. These questions were to test theoretical competence of adults to react in proper way in such cases, immediately and correctly, thus protecting themselves and children mainly.

40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} {{important}} causes of complications and mortality in medical centers are nosocomial infections. Disinfection of hospital surfaces is essential element for ensuring that infectious agents are not transmitted to patients. Alcohol-based and chlorine-based disinfectants have unfavorable properties. Given that the antimicrobial effect of heavy metals such as silver is recognized as a viable option for eliminating bacteria, the exploration of nanotechnology in this context has been described in this study. Nanotechnology uses both science and technology to produce new materials with nano-scales [...] Objectives: The effect of silver nanoparticles on some common hospital bacteria has been studied in this research [...] Patients and Methods: We have selected nine patients' metal <b>file</b> <b>covers</b> and following sterilizing, we have infected them with one of these bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. Then, the infected surfaces have been disinfected with different dilutions of silver nanoparticles. Sampling and culturing has done following four specific intervals. Afterwards, the colonies that developed have been counted and compared [...] Results: All of the three dilutions of silver nanoparticles could bring the colony count out of 7. 5 x 106 to less than 100 which indicate more than a 99 percent reduction. No remarkable difference of the three dilutions of disinfectants was observed in reducing the colony count in 5, 15, 30 and 60 minute disinfection intervals (P value > 0. 05). The effect of constant dilution of silver nanoparticles on the reduction of organisms varied in response to the time of disinfection (P value < 0. 05) [...] Conclusion: Silver nanoparticles had appropriate effects in all three types of dilutions and allowing for a more protracted contact time has given significantly better results...|$|E

The New Europe Barometer (NEB) series, originally known as the New Democracies Barometer (NDB), has been conducted annually across Central and Eastern Europe since autumn 1991. The same questions are asked in each country and repeated from year to year, so trends can be analysed across {{a wide variety of}} post-Communist societies. Approximately 1, 000 respondents in each country are interviewed face-to-face each year about their economic, political and social attitudes and behaviour. Data are available for separate years and also as a trend dataset (SN 5241). Further information on the NEB is available on the CSPP Barometer Surveys web site, along with details of other survey series. New Europe Barometer I-XV Trend Dataset, 1991 - 2007 covers 15 post-Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union: 10 new EU member states (Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania); Croatia and Serbia; and three former Soviet Union (FSU) countries (Russia, Belarus and Ukraine). Trend data starts with the first NEB surveys in 1991. The latest trend data for most countries is from the seventh New Europe Barometer round, started in autumn 2004, with some surveys {{in the early part of}} 2005. In addition, data from New Russia Barometer surveys I (January 1992) through XV (April 2007) are included. The trend file includes 302 frequently used variables from a total of 103 NEB surveys.

The depositor recommends that only expert users who are familiar with the coding and weighting structures use this dataset as limited support is available. Some considerable understanding of the data is required before meaningful analyses can be made, and care must be taken when performing time series operations as codes can vary from year to year. Not all variables from one years dataset are used in other years. The data comprises five files, ALCOHOL, AIRMILES, QREGTOWN and QCONTACT with four quarters per file and SPORT, where one <b>file</b> <b>covers</b> all four quarters. These can be joined together using the variables YEAR, SERIAL, FLOW and QUARTER. The weighting of IPS data is complex and done in several stages. When working with the system weights, great care should be taken to read the documentation concerning weighting procedures as not all records are treated in exactly the same way. Main Topics : The main dataset for 2002 contains 147 variables and covers: AIRMILES - quarter; flow; serial; United Kingdom port or route; direct leg overseas port; final overseas port; distance from United Kingdom port to first port; from first to second port; from United Kingdom port to second port.
