The dynamical equations describing evolution for the usual classical color charge Q^a(t) and Grassmanian color charges θ^i(t), θ^† i(t) of hard particle taking into account the soft fermion degree of freedom of the system are suggested. On the basis of these equations and the Blaizot-Iancu equations iterative procedure of calculation of <b>effective</b> <b>currents</b> and sources generating the scattering processes under consideration is defined and their form up to third order in powers of free soft quark field, soft gluon one, and initial values of the color charges of hard particle, is explicitly calculated.

40|$|In general {{line with}} our early works [Yu. A. Markov, M. A. Markova, Nucl. Phys. A 770 (2006) 162; 784 (2007) 443] within the {{framework}} of a semiclassical approximation the general theory of calculation of <b>effective</b> <b>currents</b> and sources generating bremsstrahlung of an arbitrary number of soft quarks and soft gluons at collision of a high-energy color-charged particle with thermal partons in a hot quark-gluon plasma, is developed. For the case of one- and two-scattering thermal partons with radiation of one or two soft excitations, the <b>effective</b> <b>currents</b> and sources are calculated in an explicit form. In the model case of `frozen' medium, approximate expressions for energy losses induced by the most simple processes of bremsstrahlung of soft quark and soft gluon, are derived. On the basis of a conception of the mutual cancellation of singularities in the sum of so-called `diagonal' and `off-diagonal' contributions to the energy losses, an effective method of determining color factors in scattering probabilities, containing the initial values of Grassmann color charges, is suggested. The dynamical equations for Grassmann color charges of hard particle used by us early are proved to be insufficient for investigation of the higher radiative processes. It is shown that for correct description of these processes the given equations should be supplemented successively with the higher-order terms in powers of the soft fermionic field.
