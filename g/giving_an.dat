5|$|There {{are several}} types of plant oils, {{distinguished}} by the method used to extract the oil from the plant. The relevant part of the plant may be placed under pressure to extract the oil, <b>giving</b> <b>an</b> expressed (or pressed) oil. The oils included in this list are of this type. Oils may also be extracted from plants by dissolving parts of plants in water or another solvent. The solution may {{be separated from the}} plant material and concentrated, <b>giving</b> <b>an</b> extracted or leached oil. The mixture may also be separated by distilling the oil away from the plant material. Oils extracted by this latter method are called essential oils. Essential oils often have different properties and uses than pressed or leached vegetable oils. Finally, macerated oils are made by infusing parts of plants in a base oil, a process called liquid-liquid extraction.|$|E

5|$|At an {{estimated}} , IK Pegasi B {{is considered to}} be a high-mass white dwarf.

(A different source gives a value of 0.72%, so there remains some uncertainty in this result.) Thus this star packs a mass greater than the Sun into a volume roughly the size of the Earth, <b>giving</b> <b>an</b> indication of this object's extreme density.|$|E

5|$|Nickel is a silvery-white metal with {{a slight}} golden tinge that takes a high polish. It {{is one of only}} four {{elements}} that are magnetic at or near room temperature, the others being iron, cobalt and gadolinium. Its Curie temperature is , meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.352nm, <b>giving</b> <b>an</b> atomic radius of 0.124nm. This crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least 70GPa. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile.|$|E
