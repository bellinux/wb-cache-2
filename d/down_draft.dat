25|$|Existing {{low-cost}} units tend to {{be older}} than the housing stock in general. For example, in 1995, 68% of the affordable rental housing stock was constructed before 1970 and another 21% were built before 1980. A considerable share of the older affordable rental stock {{has been removed from}} the market since 1995, but many of the remaining units are in older buildings. Due for example to differences in building standards, technical development and historical maintenance, the older building stock is generally of worse quality than newer buildings.

500|$|Moderate {{to heavy}} rains fell across Puerto Rico, peaking at 4.95inches (125.7mm) at Matrullas Dam. [...] The outer bands of Cleo {{produced}} peak sustained winds of 52mph (85km/h) at Point Tuna, Puerto Rico. Offshore Puerto Rico on its initial penetration of Cleo on August 23, a Lockheed WC-121N Super Constellation {{used as a}} reconnaissance aircraft experienced its port wing tip fuel tank and portion of wing torn away by extreme updraft turbulence, which injured six of its crew. [...] While trying to exit the storm, the starboard tip tank and larger portion of wing were torn away by extreme <b>down</b> <b>draft</b> turbulence. [...] The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. Cleo led to the wettest known 24‑hour period recorded for any site within the Dominican Republic for any month, with 19.99inches (507.8mm) falling at Polo. [...] Les Cayes, Haiti was leveled as the storm struck the town. [...] The aircraft carrier U.S.S. Boxer arrived {{off the coast of}} Hispaniola on August 29 to provide medical aid and evacuation services to those in the worst impacted areas of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. [...] Damage in Cuba was minimal because the hurricane had weakened and moved through quickly.|$|E

40|$|This study {{utilizes}} aircraft measurements obtained off the California {{coast to}} analyze the geometric, thermodynamic, and micro physical characteristics of convective updrafts and <b>down</b> <b>drafts</b> in the stratocumulus- topped boundary layer (BL). The vertical structure of thermodynamic and micro physical properties is consistent. The difference in peak droplet concentration between updrafts, <b>down</b> <b>drafts,</b> and the defined environment increases near the cloud top. We observe larger mean droplet diameters in <b>down</b> <b>drafts</b> near the cloud top, {{as the number of}} small droplets in cloud top <b>down</b> <b>drafts</b> appears to decrease. The horizontal variability seen in the cloud droplet spectra and micro physics properties is likely due to aerosol activation and growth in updrafts, cloud top entrainment, and penetrating cumulus. We compute the mass flux, using a mass flux parameterization. Several measured variables produce consistent results and agree with mass flux calculations from other stratocumulus datasets. U. S.

50|$|Virga {{can cause}} varying weather effects, because as rain is changed from liquid to vapor form, it removes {{heat from the}} air due to the high heat of {{vaporization}} of water. Precipitation falling into these cooling <b>down</b> <b>drafts</b> may eventually reach the ground. In some instances, these pockets of colder air can descend rapidly, creating a wet or dry microburst which can be extremely hazardous to aviation. Conversely, precipitation evaporating at high altitude can compressionally heat as it falls, and result in a gusty downburst which may substantially and rapidly warm the surface temperature. This fairly rare phenomenon, a heat burst, also tends to be of exceedingly dry air.|$|R

40|$|The {{scale length}} over which {{convection}} mixes mass in a star {{can be calculated}} as the inverse of the vertical derivative of the unidirectional (up or down) mass flux. This {{is related to the}} mixing length in the mixing length theory of stellar convection. We give the ratio of mass mixing length to pressure scale height for a grid of 3 D surface convection simulations, covering from 4300 K to 6900 K on the main-sequence, and up to giants at g = 2. 2, all for solar composition. These simulations also confirm what is already known from solar simulations, that convection doesn't proceed by discrete convective elements, but rather as a continuous, slow, smooth, warm upflow and turbulent, entropy deficient, fast <b>down</b> <b>drafts.</b> This convective topology also results in mixing on a scale as that of the classic mixing length formulation, and is simply a consequence of mass conservation on flows in a stratified atmosphere.

5000|$|A {{grass runway}} was {{constructed}} in 1927 by Cecil Levien {{with the assistance of}} native labourers. The first landing at Wau was made on 19 April 1927 by Ernest Mustar in a De Havilland DH.37 owned by Guinea Gold Airways from Lae Airfield. The airfield was extended during the Second World War to 1500 x 100 x 4000 yards as described in 1942. Wau airfield was a rough Kunai grass airstrip 3100 ft in length with a 12% slope heading directly for Mount Kaindi. Aircraft could approach from the northeast only, landing uphill and taking off downhill. The mountain {{at the end of the}} runway prevented second attempts at landing and precluded extension of the strip. Pilots had to manoeuvre Dakotas under clouds and through dangerous passes, [...] "dodging a peak here and cloud there", landing at high speeds. This required good visibility, but the weather over Owen Stanley Range was characterised by frequent storms, <b>down</b> <b>drafts,</b> and mists which rose from the jungle floor.|$|R

5000|$|February 1963: Northwest Airlines Flight 705 - A Northwest Airlines Boeing 720B was {{hit with}} a {{powerful}} updraft (it suddenly began climbing at 9,000 ft. per minute) while climbing through 17,000 ft as it tried to fly between thunderstorms shortly after takeoff. The nose pitched up so high that the pilot reacted by using full nose-down trim on the horizontal stabilizer (HS), while simultaneously pushing the elevators to the full down position. Then, an equally powerful <b>down</b> <b>draft</b> hit the plane and it went straight down in a matter of seconds. The pilot then pulled back on the yoke, moving the elevators to the full up position.

50|$|Entry to the {{building}} was originally made by a wide bridge between fountains over a shallow pool area in front of {{the building}}. This pool was eventually drained and covered over when it was found that strong <b>down</b> <b>drafts</b> of wind hitting the building on gusty days caused the fountain to soak people entering and exiting the building. An alternative design for a Rotunda-style cylindrical building was thrown out when suitable curved furnishings were costed. The building was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother in June 1966; it has 20 stories and a mezzanine level above ground. These housed the Departments of Landscape, Modern Languages, Philosophy, Biblical Studies, and Architecture as well as the library administration, before the buildings refurbishment. As its name suggests, the building originally housed all the Universitys arts departments, which had far fewer students in the 1960s. Noticeboards for long rehoused departments such as History and Social Science survive in the basement foyer area. There are also two floors below ground level that house nine lecture theatres. The building contains a cafe in the basement. It has a student computer room on the 10th floor, and a self-service language teaching centre on the second. Circulation is through two ordinary lifts and a paternoster lift which, at 38 cars, is the largest of the few surviving in the United Kingdom.|$|R
