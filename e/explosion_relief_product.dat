30|$|The latter {{mentioned}} instances {{demonstrate the}} complexity of humanitarian logistics {{and the need for}} the permanent, yet ever evolving, implementation of an ingenious design plan, and execution of logistics networks before, during, and after natural disasters strike. Several factors impact this complexity. Large demands for <b>relief</b> <b>products</b> and related uncertainties are major problems (Lin 2010). As long as disaster relief systems have a short life cycle, time plays a significant role due to nature of rescue operations (Oloruntoba and Gray 2006). To address the importance of time allocation throughout a rescue operation (Walton et al. 2011), speed is considered a high priority factor in elevating the flow of distribution and evacuation operations. Another equally important factor is the possible damage among relief bases and pathways that may challenge the effectiveness of disaster efforts (Tzeng et al. 2007). Last, but not least, is the factor that demand for <b>relief</b> <b>products</b> after disasters exhibits a dynamic behavior. During the first hours after a disaster hits, the affected areas need more products and services, but the demand for these products and services decreases as time elapses (Jabbarzadeh et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|State {{explosion}} {{is well-known}} {{to be the}} principle limitation in protocol verification. In this paper, we propose a verification technique called leaping reachability analysis (LRA) to tackle state explosion. We advocate LRA as a uniform and property-driven relief strategy for verifying general progress properties of protocols modeled as networks of communicating finite state machines (CFSMs). Unlike most existing relief strategies in the CFSM model, LRA does not confine any of the protocol attributes and still proves to be adequate for detecting all deadlocks, all nonexecutable transitions, all unspecified receptions and all buffer overflows in a protocol. We show by experiments that LRA can largely relieve the state explosion problem by reducing significantly the amount of storage space and execution time required for verification.

Interactions between the flame front and acoustic oscillations has raised technical problems in lots of combustion applications as well and has been studied theoretically and experimentally in such cases.

40|$|This paper aims at {{contributing}} to the efficient design of explosion protection systems against confined explosions. The issue addressed concerns the quantitative estimation of the protective effect of <b>explosion</b> <b>relief</b> vents {{in the case of}} confined explosions inside tunnels. A series of virtual experiments performed by computer simulation, revealed how the number of vents, their diameter, as well as the angle between the vents and the tunnel, influences the blast wave attenuation. The computational study was performed considering a complicated large-scale tunnel configuration with branches on its half portion. The purpose was the calculation of the attenuation effect due to the presence of vents by comparing the total explosion-specific impulse developing at antidiametric positions inside the tunnel. Simulations were carried out via a three-dimensional numerical model built in the computational fluid dynamics code CFX 5. 7. 1, which has been validated in previous papers against experimental overpressure histories data demonstrating reasonable performance. Computer results showed that the use of branch vents provides an effective method for shock wave attenuation following an explosion, whereas their statistical elaboration revealed that the attenuation is mainly affected by the number of vents and their diameter. In contrast, the angle between the side vents and the main tunnel appeared to slightly affect the pressure wave weakening. Eventually, the quantitative influence of the above parameters was effectively illustrated in functional diagrams, so that the total attenuation effect may be promptly estimated, if the design variables are known. In addition, two statistical models with reasonable fitting to the calculated data are proposed, which express the attenuation effect as a dependent variable of the design variables including their interactions.

40|$|Accidental gas explosions are a {{recognised}} hazard {{in process}} industries {{but they are}} also common in residential buildings. Whilst process plants have specifically designed vent reliefs to limit the enclosure damage, in homes a similar effect is achieved due to the presence of doors and windows whose failure often protects the building. There are empirically based correlations for predicting overpressure and for vent sizing, however these are limited in application to simple enclosures. In practice, enclosures have interconnected spaces which would potentially increase the flame acceleration considerably. In this paper we present the results of full scale natural gas layer tests in a twin chamber, which consisted of two 22 m 3 enclosures connected by an open doorway. Layered natural gas/air mixtures of 8, 10 and 12 % by volume, were ignited at the rear of one of the chambers. <b>Explosion</b> <b>relief</b> was provided by vent openings of 2. 48, 1. 49 or 0. 74 m 2 on the far walls of both chambers. With tests with equal large vents on each of the chambers, the dominant influence was the external explosion. The maximum overpressure was produced by tests involving a 12 % natural gas concentration. The use of a smaller vent in the adjoining enclosure had a significant effect on the maximum overpressure and the mechanism of the explosion development. However, altering the size from 1. 49 m 2 to 0. 74 m 2 had little overall effect. This was largely due to the greater generation of turbulence and the venting process which predominantly occurred via the doorway and through the ignition-chamber vent opening. The use of a smaller vent in the ignition enclosure also altered {{the manner in which the}} explosion developed. A venting driven ‘jetting’ expanding flame, propagated into the adjoining enclosure and towards the far vent opening, generating the dominant pressure peak in these type of tests...|$|R
