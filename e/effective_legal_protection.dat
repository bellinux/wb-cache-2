Although Foreign Direct Investment in Ukraine remained relatively strong since recession of the early 1990s, the country has had trouble maintaining stable economic growth. Issues relating to current corporate governance in Ukraine were primarily linked to the large scale monopolisation of traditional heavy industries by wealthy individuals such as Rinat Akhmetov, the enduring failure to broaden the nation's economic base and a lack of <b>effective</b> <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> for investors and their products.

The framework takes a functional approach, identifying six functions provided by a governance system. The paper highlights the possibilities and limits to governance reform through the adoption of <b>legal</b> <b>protections</b> {{and the use of}} ownership structure. I caution against excessive emphasis on legal rules themselves, demonstrating their insufficiency to provide the functions of governance. Instead, I first emphasize the importance of <b>effective</b> <b>legal</b> <b>protections</b> that require complementary governance institutions including political structure, the location of judicial authority, norms, and information/reputation intermediaries. Second, I draw attention to ownership structure, reviewing theoretical and empirical support for the beneficial effect of identity and concentration on the functions of corporate governance in the absence of <b>effective</b> <b>legal</b> <b>protections.</b> A review of the evidence from established and newly privatized firms reinforces these contentions. The paper concludes with four broad agenda items for both reformers and future research...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{knowledge}} can be protected, to some extent, under various intellectual property laws. However, for the most part, there is no <b>effective</b> international <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> for this subject matter. This has led to proposals for a sui generis regime to protect traditional knowledge. The precise contours of the right are yet to be determined, but a sui generis right could include perpetual protection. It {{could also result in}} protection for historical communal works and for knowledge that may be useful but that is not inventive according to the standards of intellectual property law. Developing countries have been more supportive of an international traditional knowledge right than developed countries. At the same time, developing countries have been critical of the impact of intellectual property rights on social issues such as access to medicines and access to educational materials. In light of developing country concerns about the negative effects of strong global intellectual property rights, this paper uses a development-focused, instrumentalist approach to assess the implications of a sui generis traditional knowledge right. It concludes that some of the measures sought may not achieve the desired outcome. Although intellectual property can play a role in protecting traditional knowledge, a sui generis intellectual property style right may hinder the equity-oriented goals of some traditional knowledge communities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the interaction between}} <b>legal</b> shareholder <b>protection,</b> managerial incentives, monitoring, and ownership concentration. <b>Legal</b> <b>protection</b> affects the expropriation of shareholders and the blockholder's incentives to monitor.

When <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> facilitates monitoring better laws strengthen the monitoring incentives, and ownership concentration and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> are inversely related. By contrast, when <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> and monitoring are substitutes better laws weaken the monitoring incentives, {{and the relationship between}} <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> and ownership concentration is non-monotone.

40|$|It's {{going to}} be a long process but, yeah, I mean, women have got to take a stand because it's {{happening}} far too many times to women. (Aboriginal woman – Bourke 1752 - 1754) Legislation in New South Wales provides for a justice response to family violence. People who are subject to domestic violence and abuse can seek police assistance in response to a crisis, and ongoing <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> through an application to the Local Court for an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO). The AVO scheme offers essential <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> to many women in violent relationships, and performs important public education and deterrence functions. Access to <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> under the AVO scheme is not equitably available, and is affected by regional and cultural differences. This paper outlines issues raised by Indigenous women in three rural and remote towns, about perceived social and cultural barriers to obtaining protection through the AVO scheme. It describes perceived disincentives within the AVO process for Indigenous women who might be considering seeking an order, appearing at court or breaching an order. These disincentives relate to limitations in both the operation of the scheme and the legislative framework, both of which are regarded as having more protective potential than is realised. The effectiveness of legal proceedings and orders may be improved by the addition of court connected processes that enable widened and more effective participation in decision making and programs for perpetrators and victims. In addition to more <b>effective</b> <b>legal</b> responses, multi-faceted, community driven approaches are needed that incorporate both preventive and reactive measures...|$|R

40|$|The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940 bestows <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> on two North American eagle {{species in}} the United States of America. The Act was {{originally}} aimed at the <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of only one species: the Bald Eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus, the national symbol of the USA. Later the Act was amended to extend protection also to the Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos. The Bald Eagle was an Endangered Species, but the Golden Eagle was not formally listed as Endangered nationwide in the USA. One {{of the reasons for}} extending <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> to the Golden Eagle under the Act was to strengthen the <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of the Bald Eagle, because immature Bald Eagles were being misidentified as Golden Eagles and shot. Additional factors relating to Golden Eagle mortality also made <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of the Golden Eagle desirable. The danger that a rare and legally protected species can be misidentified and mistaken for a more common and unprotected species can therefore serve as a reason for bestowing <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> on the more common species as well. Other factors may also indicate that <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of the more common species is desirable, making the case more compelling. If this line of reasoning is applied in respect of South African birds of prey, a strong case can be made in favour of extending <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> under the national biodiversity legislation to more species than the small number of species currently enjoying such protection. Species that are listed as Vulnerable under South African national biodiversity legislation may be misidentified as species that are not subject to such protection.
