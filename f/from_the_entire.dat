5|$|Morality is {{measured}} by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game. For example, the game features some missions to gain the loyalty of the squad. What the player does during one of these missions will determine whether they gain the loyalty of a squad member, which in turn will unlock a special power and also help in the final battle. Endings range <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> team surviving to the entire team being killed, Shepard included, and everything in between. Upon completing the game, a New Game Plus option is unlocked, allowing players to replay the game using the same character with which they finished it.|$|E
5|$|The tourism {{sector is}} {{considered}} a cornerstone of the economy, being a large source of employment, hard currency and economic growth. In 2010, there were 8 million visitors to Jordan. The result was $3.4 billion in tourism revenues, $4.4 billion with the inclusion of medical tourists. The majority of tourists coming to Jordan are from European and Arab countries. The tourism sector in Jordan has been severely affected by regional turbulence. The most recent blow to the tourism sector {{was caused by the}} Arab Spring, which scared off tourists <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> region. Jordan experienced a 70% {{decrease in the number of}} tourists from 2010 to 2016.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, BINA Istra (the {{operator}} of the motorway) collected €38million in revenues while its expenditure reached €230million. In {{the first half}} of 2011, however, BINA Istra reported 65.8millionkuna (€8.9million) of income in {{the first half of}} 2011, without VAT. This income represented a 30.8percent increase compared to the same period in the previous year. (The figure includes income <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> Istrian Y system, i.e., both the A8 and A9 motorways.) Most of this increase is attributed to the introduction of a closed toll system along the routes, replacing an open toll system in which a toll was charged only at the Mirna Bridge (along the A9 motorway) and the Učka Tunnel. In 1999, the Croatian government negotiated amendments to the BINA Istra concession contract. These amendments allow the government to determine tolls along the A8 and A9 motorways, and the government decided to eliminate tolls on traffic flowing along the two-lane sections of the routes; to compensate for this loss of income, the government subsidizes BINA Istra– for instance, in 2012 it is expected to receive a 165millionkuna (million) subsidy. By the end of 2010, the subsidy paid to BINA Istra reached a total of 1.3billionkuna (million); at the time, it was estimated that a further sum of 1.9billionkuna (million) may be paid in annual subsidies between 2011 and 2027, when the concession contract expires. BINA Istra estimates the total investment value of the construction it has carried out or planned on the A8 and A9 routes at one billion euros.|$|E

5|$|More than 175 {{people showed}} up for a rancorous public hearing over the {{purchase}} on April6, 2011. During the hearing, members of the Rosendale town board determined that the tax income <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> property was {{much less than the}} cost of renting part of it for parking. Residents brought up several issues, such as the liability the town would assume from falling rocks, and sinkholes. Other issues discussed were the lack of road access to the parking lot, and whether the property should be used commercially. An individual living adjacent to the property, Brett Hansen, expressed a strong desire to buy it and build additional parking lots, as well as an amphitheater. Proponents of the purchase described how ownership of Joppenbergh would allow Rosendale to connect the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail with Main Street, and how property values near the mountain would increase. The town board agreed to the purchase in a 3–2 vote on April13.|$|E
5|$|Occurring a {{year after}} Hurricane Donna, {{officials}} in the Florida Keys took precautions to brace for potential impact from the storm. The United States Navy flew their planes out of Key West, while Coast Guardsmen evacuated Alligator Reef Light, American Shoal Light, and Sombrero Key Light. Ships docked at Key West sailed out to sea to ride out the squalls. On the morning of September7, a hurricane watch was issued <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> coast of Louisiana eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. On September8, a hurricane watch was issued along the southwest coast of the state from Vermilion Bay westward. It was later extended westward to include the entire coast of Texas, and eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. A portion of the hurricane watch from Aransas Pass, Texas to Grand Isle, Louisiana was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1600UTC on September9. An estimated 500,000people fled the coasts of Texas and Louisiana, making it the largest evacuation {{in the history of}} the United States, at the time. Further, at least half of those people were from Texas. In small towns along the coast of Texas, 90100% of their populations evacuated, while 20% of people left the larger cities. Many in Galveston stayed due to protection from the Galveston Seawall.|$|E
