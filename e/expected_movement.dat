60|$|Soon {{after one}} {{o'clock in the}} morning the stillness round the zareba was {{suddenly}} broken. A roar of musketry burst from the bushes all round, and it was evident that the enemy were assembled there in great force. The troops were ordered to lie down; and fortunately here, as at El-Teb, the Arab fire was far too high, and the storm of bullets swept for the most part overhead. Many of the camels, mules, and horses were, however, hit, but only one man was killed and an officer and two men wounded. Grasping their rifles the troops lay ready to spring to their feet and repel the attack should it be made; but the hours passed on slowly without the <b>expected</b> <b>movement</b> taking place, and there was a general feeling of relief when morning at last broke. As the Arabs continued their fire, a nine-pounder and Gatling gun were brought into play upon the bushes, and the fire of the enemy soon died out and they fell back to their camp.|$|E

40|$|Consider n sensors placed {{randomly}} and independently {{with the}} uniform distribution in a d-dimensional unit cube (d> 2). The sensors have identical sensing range equal to r, for some r > 0. We {{are interested in}} moving the sensors from their initial positions to new positions so as {{to ensure that the}} d-dimensional unit cube is completely covered, i. e., every point in the d-dimensional cube is within the range of a sensor. If the i-th sensor is displaced a distance d_i, what is a displacement of minimum cost? As cost measure for the displacement of the team of sensors we consider the a-total movement defined as the sum M_a:= ∑_i= 1 ^n d_i^a, for some constant a> 0. We assume that r and n are chosen so as to allow full coverage of the d-dimensional unit cube and a > 0. The main contribution of the paper is to show the existence of a tradeoff between the d-dimensional cube, sensing radius and a-total movement. The main results can be summarized as follows for the case of the d-dimensional cube. If the d-dimensional cube sensing radius is 1 / 2 n^ 1 /d and n=m^d, for some m∈ N, then we present an algorithm that uses O(n^ 1 -a/ 2 d) total <b>expected</b> <b>movement</b> (see Algorithm 2 and Theorem 5).

40|$|When {{participants}} utilize prime {{information to}} prepare {{some or all}} aspects of the forthcoming movement, reaction time (RT) costs are obtained when the imperative response signal demands an unexpected rather than an <b>expected</b> <b>movement.</b> Longer RT in trials for which primes are invalid rather than valid, i. e., the response validity effect, are taken to reflect prolonged motoric processing time. The present study was designed to test this assumption by using the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) in order to reveal influences of response validity at motoric processes, pre-motoric processes, or both. In two response priming experiments LRP onset latency was examined when valid and invalid advance information about direction (Experiment 1) or about direction and hand (Experiment 2) was provided. RT revealed large response validity effects in both experiments. Analysis of LRP onsets provided strong evidence against the common assumption of a motoric locus of the RT increase in invalid trials. Rather, present results suggest a pre-motoric locus of the response validity effect within information processing...|$|E

40|$|As small {{waterplane}} area twin hull (SWATH) has excellent seakeeping {{performance and}} low wave resistance, this structure {{has been applied}} to unmanned surface vehicle (USV). However, with the increase of speed, fluid resistances will increase exponentially because of its large wet surface. A way to improve this situation is to reduce the depth of draft at high speed, so that all or a part of the volume of the submerged bodies is above the surface of water. Based on this idea, a new type of SWATH USV is designed in this paper. The two submerged bodies of the USV have a planing boat shape. At high speed, hydrodynamic lift force generated by the submerged bodies of the USV can push most part of the submerged bodies out of water, which can greatly reduce the resistance of the USV. In this paper, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method is used to analyze the attitude and resistance of the USV at different speed, showing that the designed USV can achieve the <b>expected</b> <b>movement</b> characteristics and low resistance at high speed. <br type="_moz" /...|$|E
40|$|Using the {{matched pair}} technique, two samples {{were used to}} {{evaluate}} the joint effect of two factors on the behavior of common stock prices. These two factors were (1) the decision by a firm to liquidate or not to liquidate LIFO inventory layers, and (2) the sign of the expected growth in earnings per share (EPS) as forecasted by security analysts, here the IBES group. A submartingale process relating to actual earnings was assumed. The market model was incorporated to calculate the direction of the <b>expected</b> <b>movement</b> of common stock prices. The findings in this study appear to support the hypothesis that the decision to liquidate or not to liquidate LIFO inventory layers is given different interpretations by the securities market depending on the sign of expected growth in EPS. The results suggest that various intervening variables mediate between based information and the behavior of the securities market when LIFO layer liquidation occurs. The final conclusion is that various intervening variables have the power to alter the interpretation of the same accounting information. ...|$|E

30|$|A {{predictive}} based {{routing protocol}} (PRP) for VANETs is proposed in [10]. PRP {{is designed for}} mobile highway scenarios and utilizes <b>expected</b> <b>movement</b> patterns for vehicles on the roads. PRP calculates the route period and actively creates a new route from an existing fault. The reliability of the link is predicted based on the communication range, the vehicle position, and the corresponding speed of the vehicle. While the route contains one or many connections, the routing period is the minimum of all connections. PRP grant numerous routing requests to be processed, to see all existing paths to the target. When the source vehicle get {{a large number of}} reply messages, the route containing the maximum estimated routing period is selected. In [11], a motion predictive based routing (MOPR) scheme is proposed by Menouar et al. This scheme predicts future movement situation of the vehicles and looks for reliable routes to prevent link breakages. If there are many possible routes among the source and the target vehicle, then MOPR selects the most stable route taking into account the moving situations of the intermediate node relative to the source and ending node. This is achieved along the direction, position, and speed messages of every vehicle. It is necessary to extend the routing contents in every node to meet the conditions of scheme.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years several {{solutions}} were proposed to support people with visual impairments or blindness during road crossing. These solutions focus on computer vision techniques for recognizing pedestrian crosswalks and computing their relative position from the user. Instead, this contribution addresses a different problem; the design of an auditory interface that can effectively guide the user during road crossing. Two original auditory guiding modes based on data sonification are presented and compared with a guiding mode based on speech messages. Experimental evaluation shows {{that there is no}} guiding mode that is best suited for all test subjects. The average time to align and cross is not significantly different among the three guiding modes, and test subjects distribute their preferences for the best guiding mode almost uniformly among the three solutions. From the experiments it also emerges that higher effort is necessary for decoding the sonified instructions if compared to the speech instructions, and that test subjects require frequent `hints' (in the form of speech messages). Despite this, more than 2 / 3 of test subjects prefer one of the two guiding modes based on sonification. There are two main reasons for this: firstly, with speech messages it is harder to hear the sound of the environment, and secondly sonified messages convey information about the "quantity" of the <b>expected</b> <b>movement...</b>|$|E
40|$|Many of {{our daily}} {{activities}} are achieved through goal-oriented routines which illustrates the adaptability and efficiency of information processing. Nevertheless, slips of action do occur. This {{study was designed to}} determine if slips of action can be induced in a well learned task and if so, how these slips affect specific indicators of task performance. Thirty (12 male) right-handed undergraduate participants were taught, with arrow cues, a sequence of dominant hand movements. Following this learning phase, a portion of the sequences were altered by either changing the spatial location of the arrow cue or by changing the actual movement goal. Results revealed that participants made numerous action slips which were most prevalent when the movement goal was altered. This suggests that participants were unable to disengage their <b>expected</b> <b>movement</b> plan and thus were vulnerable to errors. In addition to exploring the frequency of action slips we also looked at participants’ reaction and movement times on trials that preceded and followed errors and found that a speed-accuracy trade-off could not account for the slips. We also showed that frequency of slips on our task could reliably predict performance on the SART, a measure of inhibitory control, and the frequency of attention failures in daily living on the ARCES. Overall, {{the results of this study}} reveal that action slips can be induced by manipulating a well learned action routine and that the frequency of these induced slips reflects a participant’s tendency to commit action slips in everyday life...|$|E

Dynamic {{stochastic}} general equilibrium {{models that}} include policy rules for government spending, lump-sum transfers, and distortionary taxation on labor and capital income and on consumption expenditures are fit to U.

Second, responses of aggregate variables to fiscal policy shocks under rich fiscal rules can vary considerably from responses that allow only non-distortionary fiscal instruments to finance debt. Third, based on estimated policy rules, transfers, capital tax rates, and government spending have historically responded strongly to government debt, while labor taxes have responded more weakly. Fourth, all components of the intertemporal condition linking debt to expected discounted surpluses—transfers, spending, tax revenues, and discount factors—display instances where their <b>expected</b> <b>movements</b> are important in establishing equilibrium.
