Quoting this source, [...] "a qualified spouse is defined as one living in the same household as the taxpayer as of December 31st of the year concerned, and whose total amount of income for 2013 did not exceed 380,000 yen. (p. 42)" [...] This means that according to the law, a homemaker is simply someone living in the taxpayer's home whose income does not significantly contribute to the household, regardless of sex. Later in the document, the [...] "qualified spouse" [...] is referred to as [...] "his or her" [...] (p. 43), further emphasizing that the tax law is not intended to discriminate against housewives in particular.|$|E

Consequently, semantic interpretation of the text starts from surface syntax. The linguistic component of the system uses a broad-coverage, domainindependent parser of English, {{as well as a}} user-assisted semantic interpreter that memorizes its experience. The resulting semantic structures are translated into Horn clauses, a representation suitable for Explanation-based Learning (EBL). An EBL engine performs symbollevel learning on representations of both the domain theory and the example provided by the linguistic part of the system.

On the other hand, we want to make the best use of public-domain information sources such as WordNet. Rather than depend on large amounts of hand-crafted knowledge or statistical data from large corpora, we use syntactic information and information in WordNet and minimize the need for other knowledge sources in the word sense disambiguation process. We propose to guide disambiguation by semantic similarity between words and heuristic rules based on this similarity.

40|$|We {{extend the}} celebrated Chamley-Judd result of zero capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> {{and show that}} the steady state optimal capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> is nonzero, in general.

In a two sector neoclassical economy, interdependence of labour and capital margins allows the government to choose an optimal policy that involves nonzero <b>tax</b> on capital <b>income.</b> The distortion created by capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> in consumption sector can be undone by setting different rates of labour <b>income</b> <b>taxes.</b> The optimal plan thus involves zero capital <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> in both sectors only if optimal labour <b>income</b> <b>taxes</b> are equal.
