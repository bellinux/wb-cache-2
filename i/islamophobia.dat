5|$|V for Vendetta {{deals with}} issues of {{homosexuality}} (and its complement homophobia), criticism of religion, totalitarianism, <b>Islamophobia,</b> and terrorism. Its controversial story line and themes have {{been the target of}} both criticism and praise from sociopolitical groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} seen by 7.87 million {{following}} its broadcast on BBC One, however, despite the measures used to provide the balanced view, it was met with considerable controversy from Muslims, among them the Muslim Council of Britain, for fear that the episode would incite <b>Islamophobia.</b> Nearly a thousand complaints were made, although cast and crew members argued that the Muslims who opposed the episode {{did not understand the}} context.|$|E
5|$|The imams {{said that}} the three {{additional}} images were sent anonymously by mail to Muslims who were participating in an online debate on Jyllands-Postens website, and were apparently included to illustrate the perceived atmosphere of <b>Islamophobia</b> in which they lived. On 1 February, BBC World incorrectly reported {{that one of the}} images had been published in Jyllands-Posten. This image was later found to be a wire-service photograph of a contestant at a French pig-squealing contest in the Trie-sur-Baise's annual festival. One of the other two additional images (a photograph) portrayed a Muslim being mounted by a dog while praying, and the other (a cartoon) portrayed Muhammad as a demonic paedophile.|$|E
25|$|<b>Islamophobia</b> {{denotes the}} {{prejudice}} against, hatred towards, or {{fear of the}} religion of Islam or Muslims. While the term is now widely used, both the term itself and the underlying concept of <b>Islamophobia</b> have been heavily criticized. In order to differentiate between prejudiced views of Islam and secularly motivated criticism of Islam other terms have been proposed. The causes and characteristics of <b>Islamophobia</b> are still debated. Some commentators have posited an increase in <b>Islamophobia</b> resulting from the September 11 attacks, while others have associated it with the increased presence of Muslims in the United States, the European Union and other secular nations. Steven Salaita contends that indeed since 9/11, Arab Americans have evolved from what Nadine Naber described as an invisible group in the United States into a highly visible community that directly or indirectly {{has an effect on}} the United States' culture wars, foreign policy, presidential elections and legislative tradition.|$|E
25|$|Journalists may {{intentionally}} or unintentionally distort reports due {{to political}} ideology, national affiliation, antisemitism, anti-Arabism, or <b>Islamophobia.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Campus Antiwar Network {{stands for}} the {{immediate}} withdrawal from Iraq of all occupation troops and private contractors.

25|$|Although the French law {{addresses}} {{other religious}} symbols – not just Islamic headscarves and face coverings – the international {{debate has been}} centered around the impact it has on Muslims because of the growing population in Europe, especially France, {{and the increase in}} <b>Islamophobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Political {{debate has}} {{continued}} over {{issues such as}} tax reform, immigration reform, income inequality and U.S. {{foreign policy in the}} Middle East, particularly with regards to global terrorism, the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and an accompanying climate of <b>Islamophobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chong stated {{publicly}} that he supports Motion 103, which {{calls on the}} government to condemn <b>Islamophobia</b> in Canada and all other forms of religious and racial discrimination. Chong {{was one of two}} Conservative MPs, the other being Simcoe North MP Bruce Stanton, and the only leadership candidate to vote for the motion.|$|E
25|$|Congressman Ron Paul (R-Tex.) {{published}} {{a statement of}} support on August 20, 2010 to his campaign website defending the Cordoba House's planned Islamic community center. Congressman Paul attributed {{the controversy over the}} community center to <b>Islamophobia</b> and neo-conservatives who disregard their commitment to the First Amendment and property rights to agitate voters.|$|E
25|$|The EFA broadly {{stands on}} the left-wing of the {{political}} spectrum. The Brussels declaration emphasises the protection of human rights, sustainable development and social justice. In 2007 the EFA congress in Bilbao added several progressive principles to the declaration, including a commitment to fight against racism, antisemitism, discrimination, xenophobia and <b>islamophobia,</b> {{and a commitment to}} get full citizenship for immigrants, including voting rights.|$|E
25|$|In {{his essay}} On Blasphemy, Nawaz notes that all prophets and reformers blasphemed against the {{existing}} orders of their time, and that heresy {{is the only}} guarantee of progress. He lamented {{the revival of the}} atmosphere of blasphemy, and the neo-orientalist unwillingness to defend the ideals of free speech. He also criticised the term <b>Islamophobia</b> which, according to him, is a muzzle on free speech and deployed as a shield against genuine criticism.|$|E
25|$|When {{during a}} {{televised}} press conference {{he was asked}} if he believed a presidential system was possible in a unitary state. Erdoğan affirmed this and cited Nazi Germany {{as an example of how}} this is possible. However, the Turkish president's office said that Erdoğan was not advocating a Hitler-style government when he called for a state system with a strong executive. Furthermore, that the Turkish president had declared the Holocaust, anti-semitism and <b>Islamophobia</b> as crimes against humanity and that it was out of the question for him to cite Hitler's Germany as a good example.|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} European and American {{research}} indicates that terrorist bombings cause <b>Islamophobia</b> and hate crimes to flare up but, in calmer times, they subside again, although to a relatively high level. Terrorist's most persuasive message is that of fear and fear, a primary and strong emotion, increases risk estimates and has distortive effects on the perception of ordinary Muslims. Widespread Islamophobic prejudice seems to contribute to anti-Muslim hate crimes, but indirectly: terrorist attacks and intensified Islamophobic prejudice serve as {{a window of opportunity}} for extremist groups and networks.|$|E
25|$|The Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity (MASGD) in the United States {{began on}} January 23, 2013. It supports, {{empowers}} and connects LGBTQ Muslims. It aims “to increase {{the acceptance of}} gender and sexual diversity within Muslim communities.” On June 20, 2016, an interview with Mirna Haidar (a member of the MASGD’s steering committee) was published in The Washington Post. She described the MASGD as supporting “LGBT Muslims who want or need to embrace both their sexual and religious identities.” Haidar said that the support the MASGD provides is needed because {{a person who is}} “Muslim and queer “ faces “two different systems of oppression”: <b>Islamophobia</b> and homophobia.|$|E
25|$|One {{aspect of}} the {{criticism}} regarding the rhetoric justifying the War on Terror was religionism, or more specifically <b>Islamophobia.</b> Theologian Amir Hussain, who studies contemporary Muslims societies in North America, defines this concept as a stereotyping of all followers of Islam as real or potential terrorists due to alleged hateful and violent teaching of their religion. He goes on to argue that “Islam is reduced {{to the concept of}} jihad and Jihad is reduced to terror against the West.” This line of argument echoes Edward Said’s famous piece Orientalism in which he argued that the United States sees the Muslims and Arabs in an essentialized caricatures – as oil supplies or potential terrorists.|$|E
25|$|In June 2010, American {{philosopher and}} theorist Judith Butler refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the Christopher Street Day Parade in Berlin, Germany at the award ceremony, arguing and lamenting {{in a speech}} that the parade had become too commercial, and was {{ignoring}} the problems of racism and the double discrimination facing homosexual or transsexual migrants. According to Butler, even the organizers themselves promote racism. The {{general manager of the}} CSD committee, Robert Kastl, countered Butler's allegations and pointed out that the organizers already awarded a counselling center for lesbians dealing with double discrimination in 2006. Regarding the allegations of commercialism Kastl explained further that the CSD organizers don't require small groups to pay a participation fee which starts at 50 € and goes up to 1500 €. He also distanced himself from all forms of racism and <b>islamophobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ideologically {{positioned}} {{on the extreme}} or far-right of British politics, the BNP has been characterised as fascist or neo-fascist by political scientists. Under Tyndall's leadership, it was more specifically regarded as Neo-Nazi. The party is ethnic nationalist, and it espouses the view that only white people should be citizens of the United Kingdom. It calls {{for an end to}} non-white migration into the UK and the removal of settled non-white populations from the country. Initially, it called for the compulsory expulsion of non-whites, although it has since advocated voluntary removals with financial incentives. It promotes biological racism and the white genocide conspiracy theory, calling for global racial separatism and condemning mixed-race relationships. Under Tyndall, the BNP emphasised anti-semitism and Holocaust denial, although Griffin switched the party's focus on to <b>Islamophobia.</b> It promotes economic protectionism, Euroscepticism, and a transformation away from liberal democracy, while its social policies oppose feminism, LGBT rights, and societal permissiveness.|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, the Ministry of Justice in Saxony {{announced}} plans to commemorated the death of El-Sherbini with a memorial plaque in the regional court building. This plaque will state both in German and Arabic language: [...] " [...] She fell victim to <b>Islamophobia</b> and xenophobia. With dignity and commendable moral courage she withstood this." ...|$|E
500|$|The anti-fascist {{magazine}} Searchlight {{said that}} entry level for inclusion on BBC programmes should be [...] "election {{to the national}} parliament". Muhammad Abdul Bari, the Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, said [...] "We regret the BBC's decision. There is a general fear that allowing the BNP to air its toxic views will increase <b>Islamophobia</b> and give the BNP the aura of respectability needed to spread its message of hate".|$|E
500|$|Wilders {{has also}} been {{compared}} to the assassinated fellow critic of Islam and filmmaker Theo van Gogh, {{but he does not}} see himself as taking on van Gogh's mantle. Wilders has stated that he supports the free speech rights of his critics, saying that [...] "An Imam who wants a politician dead is—however reprehensible—allowed to say so". He has responded to critics' comments of racism and <b>Islamophobia</b> by stating, [...] "I don't hate Muslims. I hate their book and their ideology".|$|E
500|$|In July 2005, former CBS {{reporter}} Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage as number 61 in {{his book}} 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Goldberg wrote that [...] "Savage's brand of over-the-top bile... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left." [...] David Klinghoffer, a National Review columnist, speculated that The Savage Nation [...] "is an act, a put-on." [...] Various progressive advocacy groups such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and <b>Islamophobia</b> because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.|$|E
500|$|The play is {{centered}} on sociopolitical themes such as <b>Islamophobia</b> and the self-identity of Muslim-American citizens. It focuses on a dinner party between four people with very different backgrounds. As discussion turns to politics and religion, the mood quickly becomes heated. Described as a [...] "combustible powder keg of identity politics," [...] the play depicts racial and ethnic prejudices that [...] "secretly persist {{in even the most}} progressive cultural circles." [...] It is also said to depict the challenge for upwardly mobile Muslim Americans in the post-9/11 America. Productions have included performances by Aasif Mandvi and Erik Jensen.|$|E
500|$|In 1996 Tharoor was {{appointed}} {{director of communications}} and special projects and executive assistant to the then Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In January 2001 he {{was appointed}} Under-Secretary General for Communications and Public Information, and as Head of the Department of Public Information (UNDPI). In this capacity, {{he was responsible for}} the United Nations' communications strategy, enhancing the image and effectiveness of the organisation. In 2003 the Secretary-General gave him the additional responsibility of United Nations Coordinator for Multilingualism. During his tenure at the UNDPI, Tharoor reformed the department and undertook a number of initiatives, ranging from organising and conducting the first-ever UN seminar on anti-Semitism, the first-ever UN seminar on <b>Islamophobia</b> after the 11 September attacks, and launching an annual list of [...] "Ten Under-Reported Stories the World Ought to Know about", which was last produced in 2008 by his successor.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and <b>Islamophobia</b> within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking <b>Islamophobia</b> or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E
500|$|In the Friday {{before the}} BBC One repeat, Bunglawala wrote to Lorraine Heggessey, the BBC One controller, stating [...] "the programme, which {{was of a}} very sensational nature, {{unfortunately}} only serves to reinforce many negative stereotypes of British Muslims. Instead of being a well-informed piece of film-making, this episode of Spooks pandered to grossly offensive and Islamophobic caricatures of imams, Muslim students and mosques," [...] and warned that the [...] "increased amount of <b>Islamophobia</b> that is sure to result from the broadcasting of this programme at peak-time is wholly unacceptable and a gross violation of your responsibilities as a public service broadcaster." [...] Heggessey however, argued that the episode presented a balance view and that it fell [...] "legitimately within the story lines of Spooks." [...] Also, Ahtsham Ali of the Islamic Society of Britain claimed that the episode [...] "adds fuel to the fire of already negative perceptions of Muslims and fans the flames of British National Party rhetoric." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend {{was mixed}} towards the episode. While calling the new formula [...] "a {{breath of fresh}} air," [...] she was not entirely pleased with the final scene {{featuring}} Piz and Veronica's kiss, opining that the location {{and the fact that}} Veronica ran after Piz and kissed him back were not in keeping with Veronica's character. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club was also critical of the case of the week and the episode in general. While admiring the show's decision to address the controversial issue of <b>Islamophobia</b> in the United States, he did not like the show's characterization of Rashad, the father, noting inconsistencies about whether his storyline was one of redemption or not. [...] "There are three seemingly equal interpretations: that Veronica Mars writers believe that the cartoon is worth ruining someone's life over; that Rashad is a complex character who can be petty and vindictive; or, it's just a bunch of stuff that happens and there is no moral." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{gained a}} {{considerable}} amount of controversy, largely by Muslims who believed the episode showed Islam in a negative light, and that it could incite <b>Islamophobia.</b> Following the broadcast of the episode on BBC Three, the BBC received around 800 complaints, of which 500 of them were telephone calls, and 300 were emails, and a further 150 complaints were made after the BBC One repeat, totalling nearly one thousand complaints. The complaints made on its original broadcast appealed to the BBC not to repeat it on BBC One. The corporation chose not to drop the episode from the schedules. However, since fewer complaints were made after the repeat, members of the broadcasters believed that viewers realised the content was not as bad as expected. Inayat Bunglawala, the media secretary for the Muslim Council of Britain, stated [...] "We can't deny that the BBC have a right to screen a drama about this – it is topical," [...] but [...] "It is the treatment of the subject that will lead to attacks." ...|$|E
500|$|Afterward, Oliver {{says that}} former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke {{was one of}} the Trump campaign's backers, and that Trump had {{publicly}} denounced Duke in 2000 but then claimed to not know who Duke was in 2016. The comedian also mentions that Trump had failed to repudiate Duke in interviews with various Sunday morning talk shows {{on the day of the}} episode's broadcast, after Duke advocated his white supremacist supporters the previous week to endorse Trump due to the Republican candidate's campaign rhetoric. Up to that point, Trump had promoted bigotry against several ethnicities during his campaign, including Hispanophobia and <b>Islamophobia.</b> The comedian criticizes Trump's claim not to know who Duke was, citing a 2000 NBC News interview in which Trump called Duke [...] "a bigot [...] a racist"; Oliver notes that, having given such an answer despite the contradiction, Trump [...] "is either racist or [...] pretending to be, and at some point, there's no difference there". In total, Trump was lying about three-fourths of the time according to Oliver, who cited a PolitiFact study of the statements made by Trump since the launch of his presidential campaign.|$|E
500|$|The next broad debate, {{with the}} same five {{candidates}} as the LSE debate, in the campaign came on LBC on 22 March. Khan and Goldsmith were accused of immature insults when discussing Goldsmith's plan to allow electric cars to use bus lanes During April, further debates occurred, with the first on 12 April a head-to-head between Goldsmith and Khan on behalf of City A.M.. The issue of Goldsmith's campaign was raised, with Khan accusing Goldsmith of running a negative campaign and Goldsmith accusing Khan of hiding behind the label of <b>Islamophobia.</b> The topics of housing, transport and job-creation were all key points in the debate. [...] The BBC hosted a debate with the five major candidates broadcast on BBC One in London on 18 April. The Guardian noted an absence of any clear winner, with Khan and Goldsmith focused on each other, Berry and Pidgeon offering very similar policies and Whittle distinct but with no chance of victory. Similarly, The Spectator said {{that there had been}} a lukewarm response to policy statements from all candidates. A second head to head took place on 21 April chaired by Kirsty Wark at the Royal Geographical Society on behalf of the Evening Standard. Once again, housing, security and transport were key themes in the debate.|$|E
500|$|National Public Radio {{describes}} the play thematically {{as one that}} [...] "tackles <b>Islamophobia</b> and questions of Muslim-American identity". Isherwood noted: [...] "As two couples exchange observations about faith and politics in the modern world, the intellectual thickets they find themselves in become increasingly tangled." [...] More specifically he said, it is a play [...] "about thorny questions of identity and religion in the contemporary world, with an accent on the incendiary topic of how radical Islam and the terrorism it inspires have affected the public discourse." [...] Kapoor has [...] "rejected his Muslim upbringing (and even his surname) to better assimilate into his law firm, but he still feels the occasional tug of Islam". Geier wrote: [...] "Disgraced offers an engaging snapshot of the challenge for upwardly mobile Islamic Americans in the post-9/11 age." [...] According to The Guardian [...] Stephen Moss, the play comes to a head as the protagonist [...] "tries {{to come to terms}} with his multiple identity – American v Asian, Muslim v secularist, passive observer of injustice v activist". Although Amir has an affinity for $600 shirts with obscenely high thread counts, his home dinner party is set in his apartment which is [...] "spare and tasteful with subtle flourishes of the Orient".|$|E
