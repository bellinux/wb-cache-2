Without a reliable performance diagnosis module involved, there will be not possible to build a good health monitoring system.

In order to develop a reliable engine performance diagnosis technique, a fully understanding and proper handling of the instrumentation is essential. A engine performance fault pattern matching method has been proposed and developed in this study, two fault libraries contains a complete defined set of 51963 faults was created by using a newly serviced fighter engine component data. This pattern matching system had been verified by different approaches, such as compares with linear and nonlinear diagnosis results and compares with performance sensitivity analysis results by using LTF program engine data.
