5|$|The {{administration}} {{and management of}} the Vikos–Aoös National Park belongs to two district forest offices, supervised by a forest directorate at the prefecture level. Moreover, the office of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in the village of Papingo plays an essential role in management issues. Apart from government efforts, incentives have been given to local management organizations and the local population to participate in the protection of the park. In the park's core, according to the law, forestry activities, grazing, hunting, and fishing are prohibited. In the peripheral zone there are no such restrictions, but the Forest Service can take any necessary measure for the realization of the aims of the park. Apart from the above-mentioned activities, dangers to the park include land erosion, landslides, and wildfires which threaten the local flora and fauna. Another issue is the impact of tourism in recent decades. On the other hand, extreme geophysical conditions make the construction and maintenance of the necessary <b>infrastructure</b> <b>network,</b> mainly access routes and telecommunications, difficult.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: To create sustainable, {{adaptive}} and resilient societies we need {{to develop}} a proper understanding of infrastructure risk. This research improves such understanding by examining widespread failures of interdependent <b>infrastructure</b> <b>networks</b> from extreme climate events. By subjecting <b>infrastructure</b> <b>networks</b> to extreme climate loading, we construct ensembles of direct failure sets that lead to cascading indirect failures across topological <b>infrastructure</b> <b>networks.</b> Such analysis produces two results: (1) Estimations of the topological fragility of <b>infrastructure</b> <b>networks,</b> and (2) <b>Infrastructure</b> vulnerability quantification in terms of spatial affects on service provision and customers using <b>networked</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Producing multiple failure sets provides a wide range of possible outcomes, helping to build infrastructure failure profiles. Insights from risk analysis strengthen our understanding of infrastructure failures and are used to inform resilience-building activities for effective infrastructure provision.

40|$|Previous {{empirical}} research on urban networks has used data on <b>infrastructure</b> <b>networks</b> to guesstimate actual inter-city flows. However, {{with the exception}} of recent research on airline networks {{in the context of the}} world city literature, relatively limited attention has been paid to the degree to which the outline of these <b>infrastructure</b> <b>networks</b> reflects the actual flows they undergird. This study presents a method to improve our estimation of urban interaction in and through <b>infrastructure</b> <b>networks</b> by focusing on the example of passenger railways, which is arguably a key potential data source in research on urban networks in metropolitan regions. We first review common biases when using <b>infrastructure</b> <b>networks</b> to approximate actual inter-city flows, after which we present an alternative approach that draws on research on operational train scheduling. This research has shown that ‘dwell time’ at train stations reflects the length of the alighting and boarding process, and we use this insight to estimate actual interaction through the application of a bimodal network projection function. We apply our method to the high-speed railway (HSR) network within the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, discuss the difference between our modelled network and the original network, and evaluate its validity through a systemic comparison with a benchmark dataset of actual passenger flows...|$|R
