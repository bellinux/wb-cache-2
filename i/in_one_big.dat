25|$|As of January 2008, {{the number}} of dingoes on the island was {{estimated}} to be 120 to 150, and sightings have become less common. A University of Queensland researcher, Nick Baker, claims the dingoes on Fraser Island have adopted unusual behaviour. Rather than hunt in small packs, Fraser Island dingoes had developed a tolerance for each other and work together <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>big</b> hunting pack. Dingo-proof fences, consisting of metals bars across a concrete pit and a 1.8m high mesh fence were built around nine island settlements in 2008, to keep the dingoes out of the townships.|$|E

[...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad reported it was great to see Jack and NBC [...] "still being affected by the economy, government bailouts, and Washington hearings". Sassone much preferred [...] "Into the Crevasse" [...] than [...] "Season 4". New York magazine contributor Mark Graham said this episode of 30 Rock saw the series [...] "once again hitting a familiar, meta-flavored stride, as Tina Fey and her writing staff tried a 'ripped from the headlines' approach and took on recent real-life story lines like the 30 Rock porno". [...] "The return of Will Arnett, the existence of a Porn Liz, and one deal breaker after another: 'Into the Crevasse' had some killer lines, even if it didn't come together <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>big</b> narrative", remarked Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly.

Spargo charged that the IWW's tactic of encouraging sabotage would have the effect of undermining the honor, courage, and self-respect of the working class, causing it to lose sight of the spiritual ideals of socialism. He held that the [...] "IWW form of organization which denies autonomy to local unions and centralizes {{power in the hands of}} the executive, really involves the ideal of a bureaucratic government in the future society." [...] For Spargo, the ideal of [...] "one big union" [...] meant in practice [...] "authoritarianism and bureaucracy" [...] and [...] "the creation of a despotic industrial State in place of a political State."

On 25 January, the Joint Intelligence Committee supported the idea, as it tied in with the ULTRA-based intelligence that dozens of German divisions deployed in the west were moving to reinforce the Eastern Front, and that interdiction of these troop movements should be a [...] "high priority." [...] Arthur Harris, AOC Bomber Command, nicknamed [...] "Bomber" [...] Harris in the British press, and known as an ardent supporter of area bombing, was asked for his view, and he proposed a simultaneous attack on Chemnitz, Leipzig and Dresden. That evening Churchill asked the Secretary of State for Air, Sir Archibald Sinclair, what plans had been drawn up to carry out these proposals. He passed on the request to Sir Charles Portal, the Chief of the Air Staff, who answered that [...] "We should use available effort <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>big</b> attack on Berlin and attacks on Dresden, Leipzig, and Chemnitz, or any other cities where a severe blitz will not only cause confusion in the evacuation from the East, but will also hamper the movement of troops from the West."
