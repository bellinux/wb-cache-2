40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} {{property of}} Reservoir Computing, and signal processing techniques in general, is generalization and noise robustness. In trajectory generation tasks, we don’t want {{that a small}} deviation leads to an instability. For forecasting and system identification we want to avoid over-fitting. In prior work on Reservoir Computing, the addition of noise to the dynamic reservoir trajectory is generally used. In this work, we show that high-performing reservoirs can be trained using only the commonly used ridge regression. We experimentally validate these claims on two very different tasks: long-term, robust trajectory generation and system identification of a <b>heating</b> <b>tank</b> with variable dead-time. ...|$|E

40|$|A model, predictor, or error {{estimator}} {{is often}} used by a feedback controller to control a plant. Creating such a model is difficult when the plant exhibits nonlinear behavior. In this paper, a novel online learning control framework is proposed that does not require explicit knowledge about the plant. This framework uses two learning modules, one for creating an inverse model, {{and the other for}} actually controlling the plant. Except for their inputs, they are identical. The inverse model learns by the exploration performed by the not yet fully trained controller, while the actual controller is based on the currently learned model. The proposed framework allows fast online learning of an accurate controller. The controller can be applied on a broad range of tasks with different dynamic characteristics. We validate this claim by applying our control framework on several control tasks: 1) the <b>heating</b> <b>tank</b> problem (slow nonlinear dynamics); 2) flight pitch control (slow linear dynamics); and 3) the balancing problem of a double inverted pendulum (fast linear and nonlinear dynamics). The results of these experiments show that fast learning and accurate control can be achieved.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Energy and Buildings [© Elsevier B. V. ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] UK government has committed to generate 20 % of the country's energy from renewable sources by 2020. This paper investigates energy reduction in houses by using an innovative solar thermal collector combined with a heat pump system. The dynamic lumped parameter model for a small house is derived and the combined heating system is used to provide the typical hot water and heating requirement. The goal is to maintain thermal comfort inside the house and reduce the amount of electricity consumption used for heating and hot water. This is achieved by reducing the electricity costs through optimising the operation of the heat pump, integrating the available solar energy, and by shifting electricity consumption to the cheaper night time tariff. Models of conventional controller on–off and a multi-variable model predictive control (MPC) are developed and used for several different climatic conditions. The results showed that the model predictive controller performed best by providing better comfort, consuming less electric energy and better use of cheap night time electricity by load shifting and storing heat energy in the <b>heating</b> <b>tank...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{installation}} of a <b>heat</b> storage <b>tank</b> is a very cost-effective way to improve the performance and flexibility of a CHP plant. Such a <b>heat</b> storage <b>tank</b> usually accumulates <b>heat</b> by thermal stratification. This phenomenon {{is caused by the}} thermal buoyancy because of the difference in temperature between cold and hot water. The <b>heat</b> storage <b>tank</b> may have three operating modes, i. e. charge, discharge and storage in a CHP plant. When CHP units, which charge the <b>heat</b> storage <b>tank,</b> operate at full load, usually only two operation modes occur in the tank, i. e. charge and discharge.

The influence of flow rate on the degree of thermal stratification during charging and discharging processes is analyzed. The computation possibilities and limitations of the numerical experiments are pointed out. Special attention is given to the validation of the numerical solutions.

40|$|This project aims at {{designing}} and implementing a fuzzy controller for Multiple Input Single Output temperature process. Temperature control {{of water in}} the tank is achieved by varying current to the heating rod and inlet flow rate by a fuzzy controller. The system consists of a tank, reservoir, variable speed pump, temperature sensor placed inside a <b>heating</b> <b>tank</b> containing the heating rod, voltage controlled current source and computer. Water is pumped into the tank from reservoir and RTD measures the current temperature. The signal from the temperature sensor is sent to the DAQ interfaced to the computer. LabVIEW software is used to acquire the input signal and send the output signal that is determined by the control algorithm. Fuzzy logic controller is designed in LabVIEW. Based on the set point temperature, the controller sets the appropriate current to the heating rod. If the required temperature is less than that sensed by the temperature sensor, the flow rate of water into the tank is controlled by a variable speed pump. While conventional controllers are analytically described by a set of equations, the FLC is described by a knowledge-based algorithm. Thus this system is highly efficient in both heating and reducing the temperature of the tank. A fuzzy logic controller gives faster response, is more reliable and recovers quickly from system upsets. It also works well to uncertainties in the process variables and it does not require mathematical modelling...|$|E
40|$|The slosh {{dynamics}} in cryogenic fuel tanks under microgravity is a pressing problem that severely affects {{the reliability of}} launching spacecraft. After reaching low Earth orbit, the propellant in a multistage rocket experiences large and cyclic changes in temperature {{as a result of}} solar <b>heating.</b> <b>Tank</b> wall heating can induce thermal stratification and propellant boiloff, particularly during slosh-inducing vehicle maneuvers. Precise understanding of the dynamic and thermodynamic effects of propellant slosh caused by these maneuvers is critical to mission performance and success. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is used extensively within the space vehicle industry in an attempt to characterize the behavior of liquids in microgravity, yet experimental data to quantify these predictions is very limited and reduces confidence in the analytical predictions. A novel approach designed to produce high-fidelity data for correlation to CFD model predictions is being developed with the assistance of Florida Institute of Technology (FIT) and Sierra Lobo, Inc. With few exceptions, previous work in slosh dynamics was theoretical or treated the mass of fuel as a variable of inertia only; such models did not consider the viscosity, surface tension, or other important fluid effects. The challenges in this research are in the development of instrumentation able to measure the required parameters, the computational ability to quantify the fluid behaviors, and the means to assess both the measurements and predictions. The design of this experiment bridges the understanding of slosh {{dynamics in}} microgravity by a comprehensive approach that combines CFD tools, dynamic simulation tools, semianalytical models of the predominant fluid effects, and an experimental framework that includes measurement and characterization of liquid slosh in one-degree-of-freedom (DOF) and two-DOF experiments, and ultimately experiments in a NASA low-gravity aircraft...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project {{was to develop a}} new method of heating of pig houses and more specifically the swine nurseries with the use of Solar Heating Systems. In the proposed method a Test Shell with Solar Mass Wall, is used to service the heating needs of nursing sows while for the nurslings was created a special flooring (pad) with embodied heated pipes, throw a system of solar collectors and heating storage tank. The structural elements of this system are a solar mass wall, a specially designed heated flooring (shelter), a solar absorber, a solar collector, a heating storage tank and a heating supply tank. These elements are combined together using appropriate fluid circuits and digital controllers. The system provides a suitable environment for the nursling’ shelter {{as well as to the}} nursing sow through the solar mass wall. The system is composed of two main circuits. The first one includes the solar units and the storage (<b>heating)</b> <b>tank</b> (Circuit A) and the second one contains the supply (after-heating) tank and the pad (Circuit B). The first days are the most critical in a piglet’s life. Up to 80 % of piglet losses occur in the first 3 days of life and the majority of deaths are attributed to crushing. To reduce piglet losses by crushing by the sow the nest area must be warm. However, because of economic and hygienic disadvantages, straw is becoming less and the modern practice is to use either electric or gas infrared heaters, or underground heaters with solid plates. In the first 10 days of life, the young piglets require temperatures of at least 32 - 36 OC in the nest. Infrared heaters with IR-emitter have the highest temperature on the surface directly under the centre of the radiator, and outwards from the centre the temperature drops. An underground heater (warm water heat source) has a homogeneous surface temperature, therefore every piglet of the litter gets the same temperature in the nest area. The flooring in farrowing pens must satisfy a wide variety of criteria. The floor must be durable and easily to clean. The aim of this investigation was to test a new heating system for young piglets and to compare it with the conventional electric heating lamps and the warm water bed. This system incorporates all the benefits of the floor heating systems. In addition the controlled distribution of the solar energy, not only reduces the consumption of the electric energy to the 20 - 25 % of the consumption of the conventional system with infrared lamps, but also provides the specific thermal environment for the weaned piglets as well as to the nursing sown. Using a control system, the fluid temperature is kept close to the desired optimal temperature, in contrast with the conventional halogen and incandescent infrared lamps where the heating is regulated by the distance between the lamp and the piglets. Furthermore, the optimal temperature is regulated to decrease one degree centigrade per day and this means that the electric consumption is decreased as well. ...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The UK domestic sector {{accounts for more than}} a quarter of total energy use. This energy use can be reduced through more efficient building operations. The energy efficiency can be improved through better control of heating in houses, which account for a large portion of total energy consumption. The energy consumption can be lowered by using renewable energy systems, which will also help the UK government to meet its targets towards reduction in carbon emissions and generation of clean energy. Building control has gained considerable interest from researchers and much improved ways of control strategies for heating and hot water systems have been investigated. This intensified research is because heating systems represent a significant share of our primary energy consumption to meet thermal comfort and indoor air quality criteria. Advances in computing control and research in advanced control theory have made it possible to implement advanced controllers in building control applications. Heating control system is a difficult problem because of the non-linearities in the system and the wide range of operating conditions under which the system must function. A model of a two zone building was developed in this research to assess the performance of different control strategies. Two conventional (On-Off and proportional integral controllers) and one advanced control strategies (model predictive controller) were applied to a solar heating system combined with a heat pump. The building was modelled by using a lumped approach and different methods were deployed to obtain a suitable model for an air source heat pump. The control objectives were to reduce electricity costs by optimizing the operation of the heat pump, integrating the available solar energy, shifting electricity consumption to the cheaper night-time tariff and providing better thermal comfort to the occupants. Different climatic conditions were simulated to test the mentioned controllers. Both on-off and PI controllers were able to maintain the tank and room temperatures to the desired set-point temperatures however they did not make use of night-time electricity. PI controller and Model Predictive Controller (MPC) based on thermal comfort are developed in this thesis. Predicted mean vote (PMV) was used for controlling purposes and it was modelled by using room air and radiant temperatures as the varying parameters while assuming other parameters as constants. The MPC dealt well with the disturbances and occupancy patterns. Heat energy was also stored into the fabric by using lower night-time electricity tariffs. This research also investigated the issue of model mismatch and its effect on the prediction results of MPC. MPC performed well when there was no mismatch in the MPC model and simulation model but it struggled when there was a mismatch. A genetic algorithm (GA) known as a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II) was used to solve two different objective functions, and the mixed objective from the application domain led to slightly superior results. Overall results showed that the MPC performed best by providing better thermal comfort, consuming less electric energy and making better use of cheap night-time electricity by load shifting and storing heat energy in the <b>heating</b> <b>tank.</b> The energy cost was reduced after using the model predictive controller...|$|E
