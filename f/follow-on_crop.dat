50|$|Demand {{for fresh}} {{vegetables}} in Indiaâ€™s rapidly expanding {{towns and cities}} is growing. MPRLP and the Madhya Pradesh Department of Farmer Welfare and Agriculture Development work with Gram Sabhas to distribute improved vegetable seed starter kits, provide training and help farmers form cooperatives {{so that they can}} take advantage of this growth in demand. MPRLP also introduces farmers to the System of Rice Intensification which enables them to substantially increase paddy yields, showing farmers how to grow a <b>follow-on</b> <b>crop</b> during the dry fallow season rather than leaving the ground bare. This means they can harvest two crops a year instead of one. Training in seed production and helping cooperatives become registered and certified, gives farmers in remote areas access to quality seed of wheat, soy, bean and gram. This, as well as organic farming (for which traiing is given) gives them access to high-value markets.|$|E
