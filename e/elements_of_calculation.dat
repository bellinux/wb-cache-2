40|$|The {{evidence}} of growing dynamic of leaf surface area represents the main index which determines {{the productivity of}} the most important process of plants vital activity-photosynthesis. It is known that the determination of leaf surface area at the end of vegetation period using the method of A. A Niciporovici et al., doesn’t represent significant difficulties. Considerably more complex is the leaf surface area determination during the vegetation period. That’s why the goal of our study was the elaboration of determination method of leaf surface area in apple trees planting. The investigations carried out in intensive orchard of experimental didactic station “Criuleni ” planted with two-year saplings of the following varieties: Slava peremozhtsiam, Kalvil snow, Golden delicious, Mantuanskoe, grafted on M 4 rootstock using the distance of planting 5 x 3 m. The experiment repetition is triple. For each variation there are 24 calculable trees. The trees were formed by the free growing palmette type. The leaf surface area was determined for all the calculable trees by the way of measuring and numbering. In order to determine the dimension of the assimilation surface was measured the entire annual shoot longer than 2 - 3 cm. Besides, the spurs on the multi annual wood were counted too. In the same time was determined the quantity of leaves on an annual shoot and on a spur. From the existing data, by estimations was calculated the leaf surface area on tree and on area unity. The <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculation</b> technology are listed in the table. Table: The leaf surface area in apple trees plantin...|$|E
40|$|The Energy End-use Efficiency and Energy Services Directive (ESD) of the European Union {{requires}} {{the member states}} to define and attain an overall target of at least 9 % annual energy savings between 2008 and 2016. Even if this target is indicative, {{this is the first}} international framework mandating countries to report on their energy savings results and prove achievement of their targets. The directive thus also required the development of harmonised calculation methods that can be used by member states for this proof and reporting. Existing literature covers most of the usual issues related to energy savings evaluation, but mostly looking at single, given energy efficiency programmes or policies. The evaluation objective for the ESD implementation is different, as it aims at accounting for the whole energy savings achieved in a country. Moreover, one of the main difficulties is the diversity in history and experience on this topic among the member states. In this context, the European project EMEEES has worked out an integrated system of bottom-up and top-down methods for the measurement of energy savings. The paper presents the overview of its final results. The proposals, inter alia, include 20 bottom-up and 14 top-down case applications of general evaluation methods. They enable more than 90 % of the potential energy savings to be measured and reported. They were used as a starting point by the European Commission to develop the methods recently recommended to the member states. Furthermore, the paper briefly discusses the importance of the quantity to be measured-all or additional energy savings - and the effect of measures implemented before the entering into force of the ESD ("early action"), and what this meant for the methods to be developed. It compares the main <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculation</b> needed to ensure consistent results between bottom-up and top-down methods at the overall national level. Finally, general conclusions are drawn about what could be the next steps in developing an evaluation system that enables a high degree of comparability of results between different countries...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{to lay the groundwork}} for {{identifying}} digital mechanical parameters of materials with elastic. Most of the tests do not allow identifying these parameters automatically. The use <b>of</b> the finite <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>calculations</b> for sizing works is thus limited by a poor understanding of the mechanical properties.

In this work we present a new approach by providing a formulation is easily used by treating the inverse problem. It is based on the finite element method, which, in a direct problem, gives the displacement field knowing the mechanical properties and an inverse problem gives the mechanical knowledge of the field trips.

40|$|Residential {{mortgage}} products (also {{known as}} home loans) pricing has been long {{understood to be}} something of a ‘dark art’, requiring judgment and experience, rather than being an exact science. In the last decade, a lot has changed in this field and more and more lenders, primarily the larger lenders, are increasingly looking to make their pricing as exact as possible. Even so, inadequate pricing of residential mortgage products (in particular its substandard risk pricing) has been seen as one of major causes of the global financial crisis (GFC) and subsequent spectacular banking collapses. The underlying theme of the paper is to exhibit how contemporary lenders, in practice, price their residential mortgage products.
