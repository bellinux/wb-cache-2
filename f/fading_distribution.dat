40|$|Delay {{matters in}} future {{wireless}} communication. An appropriate limit for rates achievable under delay constraints is the delay limited capacity (DLC). In this work, the DLC of OFDM systems is investigated. Despite its complicated correlation structure the OFDM DLC is fully characterized for {{low and high}} SNR. It is shown that (under weak assumptions) the OFDM DLC is almost independent of the <b>fading</b> <b>distribution</b> in the low SNR region but strongly depends on the delay spread thereby achieving a capacity gain over AWGN capacity. In the high SNR region the roles are exchanged. Here, the impact of delay spread is negligible while {{the impact of the}} <b>fading</b> <b>distribution</b> becomes dominant. The relevant quantities and their asymptotic behaviour are derived without employing simplifying assumptions on the OFDM correlation structure. Using a general convergence framework the analysis further shows that if the delay spread becomes large even the predominant impact of the <b>fading</b> <b>distribution</b> vanishes and DLC capacity loss compared to AWGN capacity approaches 0. 58 [nats/s/Hz]. The convergence speed, the loss due to non-uniform power delay profile, and the relation to ergodic capacity is also analyzed and underlined with simulations and application examples. The main conclusion here is that OFDM fully takes advantage of the degrees of freedom of the underlying fading channel in terms of delay spread and, regardless of the <b>fading</b> <b>distribution,</b> delay sensitive capacity measures such as the DLC converge to the ergodic capacity. Finally, since universal bounds are obtained which apply to any <b>fading</b> <b>distribution</b> the results can also be used for other classes of parallel channels extending the range of applicability...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} unify <b>fading</b> <b>distributions</b> by {{modeling}} the magnitude-squared of the instantaneous channel gain as an infinitely divisible random variable. A random variable {{is said to}} be infinitely divisible, if it can be written as a sum of n ≥ 1 independent and identically distributed random variables, for each n. Infinitely divisible random variables have many interesting mathematical properties, which can be applied in the performance analysis of wireless systems. It is shown that the proposed unification subsumes several unifications of <b>fading</b> <b>distributions</b> previously proposed in the wireless communications literature. In fact, almost every distribution used to model multipath, shadowing and composite multipath/shadowing is shown {{to be included in the}} class of infinitely divisible random variables.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} the land mobile satellite channel, predicting the statistical <b>fade</b> <b>distribution</b> in a given urban or suburban area described by objective data. The channel modelling is based on a conditional Rician distribution, whose parameters are related to physical parameters such as building height, street width, azimuth and elevation angles of the satellite link. Relationships between Rician and physical parameters are estimated by means of a ray-tracing method based on the uniform theory of diffraction, and statistically varying physical parameters are described by analytical distributions. The model is applied to a typical suburban area, and very good agreement is found between simulations of the <b>fade</b> <b>distribution</b> and radio measurements at L, S and X bands for two elevation angles...|$|R
