Methodo-logy. The problem solution was carried out with using the {{finite element analysis program}} NASTRAN. The finite element model is a tank shell of the railway eight-wheel tank car of model 15 - 1443. The load was presented as pressure. The value was accepted equal 0, 4 MPa. The finite element model strain-stress state was analyzed. The tank head depth changed ranging from 0, 2 m to 1, 5 m. Findings. The rational tank head depth was 0, 47 m from the <b>tank</b> <b>vessel</b> durability condition. This allows to improve the basic tank car parameters. It means to increase the <b>tank</b> <b>vessel</b> volume and to increase the capacity at 0, 7 ton. Authors has investigated that an additional increase of the <b>tank</b> <b>vessel</b> volume and the vehicle capacity can be achieved when the tank head sheets thickness as high as 13 mm. In this case it is necessary to recognize that the rational tank head depth is 0, 4 m. Tank capacity can be increase at 1 ton. Originality. This paper presents the method of analysis of the tank car volume increase. The tank car volume increase and thus а capacity of vehicle increase allows to improve the car productiveness. Calculations results allow to give the dependence of the maximum equivalent stresses in a tank head which the depth of the one change. Practical value. It is shown that the tank head depth reduction will allow to improve parameters of the existing railway tank when the <b>tank</b> <b>vessel</b> durability meets the requirements.

40|$|Steel conical {{tanks are}} widely used for liquid storage in North America and elsewhere. A number of those tanks {{collapsed}} in the last decades {{as a result of}} instability of the steel shells. Despite being widely used, no specific design procedure is available <b>for</b> conical <b>tanks</b> under dynamic conditions. The research conducted in the current thesis presents a simplified approach for the design of steel conical tanks when subjected to ground excitations in the form of horizontal and vertical excitations. First, the capacity of steel conical tanks to avoid yielding and buckling of the <b>tank</b> <b>vessel</b> under hydrodynamic pressure resulting from horizontal ground excitation is evaluated using non-linear static pushover analysis. The capacity of steel conical tanks under hydrodynamic pressure resulting from vertical ground excitation is then evaluated using the same procedure. The analyses are conducted numerically using a non-linear finite element model that accounts for the effects of large deformations and geometric imperfections on the stability of steel conical tanks. Based on the obtained capacities, a design approach is proposed which is based on satisfying an interaction formula that avoids both yielding and buckling of the <b>tank</b> <b>vessel.</b> This formula {{is a function of the}} steel conical tank capacities and the seismic demands resulting from hydrodynamic pressure including both impulsive and sloshing components. Finally, this design approach is validated through comparison with the results of non-linear dynamic analysis. The effect of the base rocking motion on the seismic behaviour of conical shaped steel tanks is then studied and a mechanical analog that simulates the forces acting on a conical tank subjected to a horizontal excitation including the effect of this base rocking motion is developed. This mechanical model takes the flexibility of the tank walls into consideration as well the hydrodynamic pressure acting on the tank base...|$|R
