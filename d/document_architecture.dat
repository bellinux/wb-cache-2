Since this report is a snapshot of current work, the material described here may change before the handbook is published. The theme of the report is that <b>documenting</b> an <b>architecture</b> entails <b>documenting</b> the set of relevant views of that architecture, and then completing the picture by documenting information that transcends any single view. The audience for <b>Documenting</b> Software <b>Architectures</b> is the community of practicing architects, apprentice architects, and developers who receive architectural documentation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel perspective on archiving <b>architecture</b> <b>documents</b> in large organizations. Designing and architecting a system deals with modeling {{the high level}} structure of a system in terms of views, architectural patterns and styles. Aspects such as knowledge management and archiving of architecture work done on artifacts of software projects challenge the large organizations. Knowledge management in such organizations depends on how well the company preserves the knowledge acquired on projects and how well the company provides the facilities to retrieve that architectural knowledge. The main issue in identification of the <b>architecture</b> <b>documents</b> is how we annotate these documents while storing in the repository. We have identified an approach on how these <b>architecture</b> <b>documents</b> can be annotated with architecture properties, and provided a comprehensive search design on the <b>architecture</b> <b>documents</b> already stored in the database. We describe how this perspective offers a good solution on archiving <b>architecture</b> <b>documents</b> and outlines various issues worthy of further exploration. 1...|$|R
