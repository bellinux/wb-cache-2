Most of these {{turn out to}} be equivalent either to <b>injectivity</b> or to surjectivity of the transition function of the automaton; however, there is one more alternative that does not match either of these two definitions. It applies to automata such as the Game of Life that have a quiescent or dead state. In such an automaton, one can define a configuration to be [...] "finite" [...] if it has only finitely many non-quiescent cells, and one can consider the class of automata for which every finite configuration has at least one finite predecessor. This class turns out to be distinct from both the surjective and injective automata, and in some subsequent research, automata with this property have been called invertible finite automata.|$|E

50|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>injectivity</b> and local <b>injectivity</b> in the theorem is necessary, as there exist cellular automata that are locally injective but not injective.
