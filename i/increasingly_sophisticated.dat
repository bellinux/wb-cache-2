5|$|Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski mailed or hand-delivered {{a series}} of <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> bombs that cumulatively killed three people and injured twenty-three. He took extreme care in {{preparing}} these devices to avoid leaving fingerprints; he also purposefully left misleading clues in them.|$|E
5|$|Between the 1980s and the 2000s, {{with the}} rise of {{databases}} such as Compustat and EDGAR and software such as SAS, articles became mathematically more rigorous with <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> statistical analyses, and accounting practitioners comprised a decreasing proportion of authors in the journal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Soviets were {{designing}} and constructing <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> anti-ballistic missile defense systems to protect strategically important facilities around Moscow, reducing {{the threat posed}} by American ICBMs. These developments compelled the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, to commission a study to look into ways of improving the survivability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.|$|E
5000|$|According to Alex Carey, one {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} 20th century was [...] "the professionalising and institutionalising of propaganda", as it became an <b>increasingly</b> prominent, <b>sophisticated,</b> and self-conscious tactic of both government and business.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, US Embassy {{sources have}} {{reported}} that Houthis used <b>increasingly</b> more <b>sophisticated</b> tactics and strategies in their conflict with the government as they gained more experience, and that they fought with religious fervor and courage.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} few years, we have {{developed}} a 434 MHz circular scanner for scattered fields measurements purposes. Even if this system has originally been designed for biomedical applications, {{it can also be}} used for industrial applications like fluid flow control or non destructive evaluation of heterogeneous materials. In conjunction with this experimental setup, in collaboration with our partners (UPC, TUE, RUG), we developed <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticate</b> modeling tools to improve the accuracy of the scanner fields description. In this presentation, we will focus on the comparison between measured and simulated fields, from raw to carefully controlled measurements and from 2 D to 3 D models...|$|R
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} sustainability {{and the related}} commitments and liabilities of international standards such as the UNGC, of which the bank is a member, lead to an <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> and ambitious risk management over the years. Credit Suisse operates a process which since 2007 uses RepRisk, a Swiss provider of ESG Risk analytics and metrics, to screen and evaluate environmental and social risks of risky transactions and due diligence.|$|E
5|$|Buildings, {{operations}} and management have become <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> {{since the mid}} 20th century, when international airports began to provide infrastructure for international civilian flights. Detailed technical standards {{have been developed to}} ensure safety and common coding systems implemented to provide global consistency. The physical structures that serve millions of individual passengers and flights are among the most complex and interconnected in the world. By the second decade of the 21st century, there were over 1,200 international airports and almost two billion international passengers along with 50 million metric tonnes of cargo were passing through them annually.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, their props and stage {{equipment}} became <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated.</b> When {{they started to}} fill stadium sized venues and bigger, they ran into {{the problem of the}} audience no longer being able to see them due to the increased seating capacity – this problem was especially clear in their free 2006 concert in Rio de Janeiro on the A Bigger Bang tour, which used over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a video screen almost 13 metres in length. Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5km), sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern {{down the length of the}} beach, in order to keep the sound in sync with music from the stage; for every 340 metres of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second.|$|E
50|$|The Court {{continued}} its trend towards a greater expansion of personal jurisdiction that {{falls within the}} Constitutional limits of due process. This decision reflected a growing and <b>increasingly</b> more <b>sophisticated</b> economy, in which more commercial transactions were taking place across state lines.|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Global and regional economic and environ-mental changes are increasingly influencing local land-use, livelihoods, and ecosystems. At the same time, cumulative local land changes are driving global and regional changes in biodiversity and the environment. To understand {{the causes and}} consequences of these changes, land change science (LCS) draws on a wide array synthetic and meta-study techniques to generate global and regional knowl-edge from local case studies of land change. Here, we review the characteristics and applications of synthesis methods in LCS and assess {{the current state of}} synthetic research based on a meta-analysis of synthesis studies from 1995 to 2012. Publication of synthesis research is accel-erating, with a clear trend toward <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticate...</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{government}} agencies, academic centers, {{and researchers}} affiliated with them provide an increasing {{share of the}} science base for policy decisions, they are also subject to efforts to politicize or silence objective scientific research. Such actions <b>increasingly</b> use <b>sophisticated</b> and complex strategies that put evidence-based policy making at risk...|$|R
5|$|Competing {{with the}} {{arboreal}} hypothesis {{is the idea}} that birds evolved from running bird ancestors, known as the cursorial (or ground up) hypothesis. This scenario may have involved ancient birds jumping or running along the ground and briefly becoming airborne, perhaps to avoid obstacles or catch insects. As these animals strove to overcome the force of gravity, powered flight may have appeared early on. They may also have used their ground speed to run up trees or other steep slopes, developing <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> flapping mechanism to assist with this. This model requires a highly cursorial and feathered ancestor. Proponents of the cursorial hypothesis cite the legs, feet and hands of Archaeopteryx as inheritance from a cursorial maniraptoran ancestor. This model has also had many adherents over the years, including John Ostrom and Jacques Gauthier.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three years the Combined Bomber Offensive had forced the Luftwaffe to invest heavily in air defence. In the {{campaign}} against the RAF, the German air defence system, named the Kammhuber Line, had become <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated.</b> In 1942 the introduction of Lichtenstein radar, despite its early teething difficulties, and greater improvements in the armament and capability of German night fighters produced a force capable of inflicting heavy losses on British bomber streams. Though British losses rarely reached more than ten percent of a raid—considered a minimum target to irreparably damage British combat power—the night fighter force grew in size and potency. British losses in the Battle of the Ruhr (March–July 1943) and most notably in the Battle of Berlin (November 1943 – March 1944) reached an all-time high; 569 bombers in the latter campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century saw <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> educational, visitor service, and {{interpretation}} services. Botanical gardens started to cater for many interests and their displays reflected this, often including botanical exhibits on themes of evolution, ecology or taxonomy, horticultural displays of attractive flowerbeds and herbaceous borders, plants from different parts of the world, special collections of plant groups such as bamboos or roses, and specialist glasshouse collections such as tropical plants, alpine plants, cacti and orchids, as well as the traditional herb gardens and medicinal plants. Specialised gardens like the Palmengarten in Frankfurt, Germany (1869), one of the world's leading orchid and succulent plant collections, have been very popular. There was a renewed interest in gardens of indigenous plants and areas dedicated to natural vegetation.|$|E
50|$|While some {{fighting}} forces such {{as those}} maintained by South Africa have already been recognized for their professional competence and operational record, intermediate nations like Ethiopia also grow <b>increasingly</b> more <b>sophisticated,</b> adding to dynamic patterns of change and transformation illustrated from the earliest times on the continent, to the present.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>increasingly</b> {{powerful}} and <b>sophisticated</b> farm machinery allowed a single farmer to work larger areas {{of land and}} fields grew bigger.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{marketing}} researchers have been <b>increasingly</b> using <b>sophisticated</b> computerized search algorithms to find experimental designs. This paper reviews some fundamentals of experimental design, orthogonality, and balance, and introduces the idea of design efficiency. It then compares some widely available design software including Sawtooth Software's CVA and SAS Institute's OPTEX programs...|$|R
5|$|This led to {{a series}} of <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> models to better predict the {{effectiveness}} of an ABM system and what the opposition would do to improve their performance against it. A key development was the Prim-Read theory, which provided an entirely mathematical solution to generating the ideal defensive layout. Using a Prim-Read layout for Nike-X, Air Force Brigadier General Glenn Kent began considering Soviet responses. His 1964 report produced a cost-exchange ratio that required $2 of defense for every $1 of offence if one wanted to limit US casualties to 30 percent of the population. The cost increased to 6-to-1 if the US wished to limit casualties to 10 percent. ABMs would only be cheaper than ICBMs if the US was willing to allow over half its population die in the exchange. When he realized he was using outdated exchange rates for the Soviet ruble, the exchange ratio for the 30 percent casualty rate jumped to 20-to-1.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} genomic {{knowledge}} has enabled <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> applications of synthetic biology. In 2010 {{researchers at the}} J. Craig Venter Institute announced {{the creation of a}} partially synthetic species of bacterium, Mycoplasma laboratorium, derived from the genome of Mycoplasma genitalium.|$|E
25|$|This is {{demonstrated}} in the closing numbers of all four acts: as the drama escalates, Mozart eschews recitativi altogether and opts for <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> writing, bringing his characters on stage, revelling in a complex weave of solo and ensemble singing in multiple combinations, and climaxing in seven- and eight-voice tutti for acts 2 and 4.|$|E
50|$|He {{also worked}} with Henry Brem of the Johns Hopkins University Medical School on a drug-delivery system for the {{treatment}} of brain cancer, to deliver chemotherapy directly to a tumor site. The wafers or chips that he and his teams have designed have become <b>increasingly</b> more <b>sophisticated,</b> and can now deliver multiple drugs, and respond to stimuli.|$|R
30|$|The {{development}} of experimental {{science in the}} past half century has produced advances in areas such as electroncs and communications, new materials, optical technologies, computer processing techniques and biomedical science, to name just a few. These advances have in turn motivated the design of experiments that are <b>increasingly</b> complex, <b>sophisticated,</b> and ambitious, producing results of unprecedented accuracy, precision, and novelty.|$|R
40|$|Techniques for {{information}} hiding have become <b>increasingly</b> more <b>sophisticated</b> and widespread. With high-resolution digital images as carriers, detecting hidden messages has become considerably more di#cult. This paper describes {{an approach to}} detecting hidden messages in images that uses a wavelet-like decomposition to build higher-order statistical models of natural images. Support vector machines are then used to discriminate between untouched and adulterated images...|$|R
25|$|Sports {{broadcasting}} became <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> {{through the}} 1970s. ABC, the Seven Network and the Nine Network joined together to broadcast the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, {{with the opening}} and closing ceremonies telecast live, and highlights packages shown each night. During November of the same year, RTS-5a commenced transmissions in Riverland, with GTW-11 launching in Geraldton on 21 January 1977.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} using similar but <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> apparatuses all returned the null result as well. Conceptually different experiments that also attempted to detect {{the motion of the}} aether were the Trouton–Noble experiment(1903), whose objective was to detect torsion effects caused by electrostatic fields, and the experiments of Rayleigh and Brace (1902, 1904), to detect double refraction in various media. However, all of them obtained a null result, like Michelson–Morley (MM) previously did.|$|E
25|$|The 18th {{century was}} mainly {{an era of}} {{consolidation}} of the techniques developed in the previous century. Running rings began to appear along the fishing rods, which gave anglers greater control over the cast line. The rods themselves were also becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> and specialized for different roles. Jointed rods became common {{from the middle of}} the century and bamboo came to be used for the top section of the rod, giving it a much greater strength and flexibility.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} examine various {{denial of service}} attacks and network defense {{measures}} taken against them. A historical look at the evolution of these attacks from different flood attacks to zombie driven botnet attacks will shed light on their <b>increasingly</b> more <b>sophisticated</b> design and the networking community efforts to combat them. The current technology, motivation and future trends of distributed denial of service botnet attacks will be also be presented...|$|R
40|$|Single {{molecule}} tracking in live {{cells is}} the ultimate tool to study subcellular protein dynamics, but it is often limited by the probe size and photostability. Due to these issues, long-term tracking of proteins in confined and crowded environments, such as intracellular spaces, remains challenging. We have developed a novel optical probe consisting of 5 -nm gold nanoparticles functionalized with a small fragment of camelid antibodies that recognize widely used GFPs with a very high affinity, which we call GFP-nanobodies. These small gold nanoparticles can be detected and tracked using photothermal imaging for arbitrarily long periods of time. Surface and intracellular GFP-proteins were effectively labeled even in very crowded environments such as adhesion sites and cytoskeletal structures both in vitro and in live cell cultures. These nanobodycoated gold nanoparticles are probes with unparalleled capabilities; small size, perfect photostability, high specificity, and versatility afforded by combination with the vast existing library of GFP-tagged proteins. � � Over the last decade, it has become essential {{to work at the}} individual molecule scale in order to better understand complex cellular processes. Numerous and <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticate...</b>|$|R
25|$|One {{example of}} this {{practice}} is Microsoft, whose product developers publish their personal blogs {{in order to pique}} the public's interest in their work. Collections of personal web pages published by large service providers remain popular and have become <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated.</b> Whereas operations such as Angelfire and GeoCities have existed {{since the early days of}} the Web, newer offerings from, for example, Facebook and Twitter currently have large followings. These operations often brand themselves as social network services rather than simply as web page hosts.|$|E
25|$|Researchers across Japan have {{unveiled}} <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> robots {{with different}} functions, including a talking office receptionist, {{a security guard}} and even a primary school teacher. The newest model of domestic helper, AppriAttenda, is developed by Toshiba. This is a robot that can fetch containers from a refrigerator by using its two arms and moves on wheels. The purpose in creating such robots is to make older people's lives easier {{when they have to}} manage alone. The robots could help them with basic tasks inside the house.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately neuroscientists {{would like}} to {{understand}} {{every aspect of the}} nervous system, including how it works, how it develops, how it malfunctions, and how it can be altered or repaired. The specific topics that form the main foci of research change over time, driven by an ever-expanding base of knowledge and the availability of <b>increasingly</b> <b>sophisticated</b> technical methods. Over the long term, improvements in technology have been the primary drivers of progress. Developments in electron microscopy, computers, electronics, functional brain imaging, and most recently genetics and genomics, have all been major drivers of progress.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the rise}} of the [...] "IT-age" [...] in the 21st-Century, the BPD has rose to {{challenge}} of fighting cybercrime, and has a modern and competent team focusing on the <b>increasingly</b> complex and <b>sophisticated</b> methods of cybercriminals.|$|R
25|$|As {{group members}} {{accumulated}} an expanding repertoire of songs for different occasions, interpersonal call-and-response patterns evolved along one trajectory to assume linguistic form.

50|$|Following {{coverage}} of ASCOM in Sky & Telescope magazine several months later, ASCOM architects such as Bob Denny, Doug George, Tim Long, and others later influenced ASCOM into becoming {{a set of}} codified interface standards for freeware device drivers for telescopes, CCD cameras, telescope focusers, and astronomical observatory domes. As a result, amateur robotic telescopes have become <b>increasingly</b> more <b>sophisticated</b> and reliable, while software costs have plunged. ASCOM has also been adopted for some professional robotic telescopes.|$|R
