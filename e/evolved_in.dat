5000|$|In physics, the Schrödinger picture (also {{called the}} Schrödinger representation) is a {{formulation}} {{of quantum mechanics}} {{in which the state}} vectors <b>evolve</b> <b>in</b> time, but the operators (observables and others) are constant with respect to time. This differs from the Heisenberg picture which keeps the states constant while the observables <b>evolve</b> <b>in</b> time, and from the interaction picture in which both the states and the observables <b>evolve</b> <b>in</b> time. The Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures are related as active and passive transformations and commutation relations between operators are preserved in the passage between the two pictures.|$|R

5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound {{can be considered}} a {{musical instrument}}—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments <b>evolved</b> <b>in</b> step with changing applications.|$|E

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline <b>evolved</b> <b>in</b> a haphazard manner during the 1990s, {{and it was not}} until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} certain mallards appear {{to be closer to}} their Indo-Pacific relatives while others are related to their American relatives. Mitochondrial DNA data for the D-loop sequence suggests that mallards may have <b>evolved</b> <b>in</b> the general area of Siberia. Mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and other deposits of fossil bones in Europe, without a good candidate for a local predecessor species.

Due to the large size of the La3+ ion, La2O3 adopts a hexagonal 7-coordinate structure that changes to the 6-coordinate structure of scandium oxide (Sc2O3) and yttrium oxide (Y2O3) at high temperature. When it reacts with water, lanthanum hydroxide is formed: {{a lot of heat}} is <b>evolved</b> <b>in</b> the reaction and a hissing sound is heard.
