5|$|According to the Kennel Club Purebred Dog Health Survey {{conducted}} in 2004, the two breeds <b>had</b> <b>similar</b> average lifespans: {{the median age}} at death was 12 years 3 months for Pembrokes, and 12 years 2 months for Cardigans. The {{main causes of death}} were similar in both breeds: the primary causes were canine cancer and old age. However, the Pembroke breed showed a higher proportion of deaths attributed to either kidney failure or a urethral obstruction.|$|E
5|$|After Shui-bian's {{successful}} presidential campaign, Chen Chi-mai, as {{a leader}} of the Justice Alliance faction, supported the proposal of another member to revise the pro-independence guideline.

30|$|In addition, upon heading samples 1 – 10 to 1000  °С (Table 1), the {{formation}} of complex iron and manganese oxide occurs via similar mechanism. The formed compounds <b>have</b> <b>similar</b> peaks regardless of the initial composition. This is related to rhombohedral structure, in which all cations are trivalent.

50|$|A further {{issue is}} {{that in many cases}} there is little that differentiates the BPO {{providers}} other than size.

5|$|Belgrano had {{symptoms}} of syphilis, {{which he had}} caught during his time in Europe.

Rejection by the committee members delayed the approval of Castelli until 1796.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of pterosaurs and modern birds and {{reptiles}} {{have been used}} to infer daily activity patterns of pterosaurs. The pterosaur genera Pterodactylus, Scaphognathus, and Tupuxuara have been inferred to be diurnal, Ctenochasma, Pterodaustro, and Rhamphorhynchus have been inferred to be nocturnal, and Tapejara has been inferred to be cathemeral, being active throughout the day for short intervals. As a result, the possibly fish-eating Ctenochasma and Rhamphorhynchus may have <b>had</b> <b>similar</b> activity patterns to modern nocturnal seabirds, and the filter-feeding Pterodaustro may have <b>had</b> <b>similar</b> activity patterns to modern anseriform birds that feed at night. The differences between activity patterns of the Solnhofen pterosaurs Ctenochasma, Rhamphorhynchus, Scaphognathus, and Pterodactylus may also indicate niche partitioning between these genera.|$|E
5|$|Despite the evident {{conflicts}} between amateurism and the Soviet {{system in which}} athletes received stipends, jobs, and housing at state expense, Brundage took no action against the USSR or Warsaw Pact nations with similar systems; when challenged on this point, he argued that Western nations <b>had</b> <b>similar</b> abuses, such as athletic scholarships. The Soviet system remained in place, though Western nations reacted by giving their athletes greater state support.|$|E

5|$|In 1979 Colalucci {{undertook}} {{a series of}} experiments to discover the right approach {{for the restoration of}} the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. The investigation began by testing small areas of the wall fresco, Conflict over the Body of Moses by Matteo de Lecce, which <b>had</b> <b>similar</b> physical and chemical attributes to the painting techniques employed on Michelangelo's frescoes. Trials to find the right solvents were continued on {{a small portion of the}} Eleazar and Matthan lunette.|$|E
5|$|In a game {{noted for}} {{dominant}} defense performances for both teams, offensively, both Alabama and LSU <b>had</b> <b>similar</b> statistics. The Crimson Tide compiled 295yards of total offense {{as compared to}} LSU's 239yards. Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron completed 16 of 28passes for 199passing yards. His top receiver in the game was Trent Richardson who had 80yards on 5receptions, followed by Marquis Maze with 61yards on 6receptions.|$|E
5|$|Studies of the {{olfactory}} bulbs of dromaeosaurids {{reveal that}} they <b>had</b> <b>similar</b> olfactory ratios for their size to other non-avian theropods and modern birds with an acute sense of smell, such as tyrannosaurids and the turkey vulture, probably reflecting {{the importance of}} the olfactory sense in the daily activities of dromaeosaurids such as finding food.|$|E

5|$|The {{dictator}} had maius imperium {{and total}} authority {{to command the}} state, however, since the dictator generally tried to maintain order, this did not conflict with {{the responsibilities of the}} other magistrates, who continued to function during a dictatorship.

Kona was often so busy that customers had to make reservations to get a lane during open (non-league) bowling hours. At its peak, Kona Lanes averaged more than 80 lines on each of its 40 lanes.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} the Clarke Codex of Plato's dialogues at Oxford, Martin Schanz noticed that isolated {{letters in the}} margins of two dialogues formed an alphabetic series and marked every hundredth standard line (alpha = 100, beta = 200, etc.). He was able to show that other manuscripts <b>had</b> <b>similar</b> marginal markings. His 1881 article named this kind of line-counting 'partial stichometry' and contrasted it to 'total stichometry' studied by Graux.|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest {{can also}} {{listen in on}} the alarm calls of other species, and by doing so can reduce their risk of predation. One study showed, along with other ungulates, wildebeests responded more {{strongly}} to the baboon alarm calls compared to the baboon contest calls, though both types of calls <b>had</b> <b>similar</b> patterns, amplitudes, and durations. The alarm calls were a response of the baboons to lions, and the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred.|$|E
