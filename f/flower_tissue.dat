40|$|Since {{selenomethionine}} {{appears to}} be a better precursor of ethylene in senescing <b>flower</b> <b>tissue</b> of Ipomoea tricolor and in indole acetic acid-treated pea stem sections than is methionine (Konze JR, N Schilling, H Kende 1978 Plant Physiol 62 : 397 - 401), we compared the effectiveness of selenomethionine and methionine to participate in reactions which may be connected to ethylene biosynthesis. Evidence is presented that selenomethionine is also a better substrate of methionine adenosyltransferase (ATP: methionine S-adenosyltransferase, EC 2. 5. 1. 6) from I. tricolor, the Vmax for selenomethionine being twice as high as that for methionine. The affinity of the enzyme is higher for methionine than for selenomethionine, however. Methionine added to <b>flower</b> <b>tissue</b> together with selenomethionine inhibits the enhancement of ethylene synthesis by the seleno analog. Likewise, methionine reduces the high, selenomethionine-dependent reaction rates of methionine adenosyltransferase from I. tricolor <b>flower</b> <b>tissue.</b> On the other hand, selenomethionine is less effective as an ethylene precursor than is methionine in model systems involving oxidation by free radicals. It was concluded that activation of methionine by methionine adenosyltransferase and formation of S-adenosylmethionine {{are more likely to be}} involved in ethylene biosynthesis than is oxidation of methionine by free radicals...|$|E

Such aposematic signaling has been hypothesized to be widespread in plants, however, it has up to now only been shown for visual signals. Correlations between identical compounds in different plant tissues, on the other hand, can be informative about the (co-) regulation of their biosynthesis or emission. Here I use Brassica rapa to investigate (1) {{correlations between}} identical metabolites (volatiles, glucosinolates) in leaf and <b>flower</b> <b>tissue,</b> and (2) correlations between volatiles and glucosinolates in the same plant organs (flowers and leaves). Whereas the amounts of many glucosinolates were positively correlated in leaves and <b>flower</b> <b>tissue,</b> identical leaf, and floral VOCs showed no such correlations, indicating independent regulation of emission. None of the leaf or flower volatiles showed positive correlations with the two major glucosinolates (gluconapin, glucobrassicanapin) or {{the sum of all}} glucosinolates in either leaves or flowers. Some VOCs, however, showed positive correlations with minor glucosinolates which, however, represented {{less than one percent of}} the total amounts of glucosinolates. Some leaf monoterpenes showed negative associations with gluconapin. The lack of consistent positive correlations between VOCs and major defense compounds suggests that plants do not chemically signal their defense status. This could be adaptive as it may avoid eavesdropping by specialist herbivores to locate their host plants. Negative correlations likely indicate chemical trade-offs in the synthesis of secondary metabolites...|$|E

Transgenic Petunia hybrida plants containing a CaMV 35 S promoter-driven chalcone synthase A (ChsA) gene cloned into the episomal vector produced flowers with a white-spotted phenotype at high frequency. The spots were found at random locations in the petals and occurred in corresponding positions in both the upper and lower epidermis, indicating that the spots were non-clonal. The spotted phenotype was somatically stable and was inherited through meiosis. In white-spotted <b>flower</b> <b>tissue,</b> steady-state ChsA mRNA levels were downregulated but rates of RNA transcription were unaffected, suggesting that the phenotype resulted from post-transcriptional gene silencing of the endogenous and episomal ChsA genes.

Relatively small increases in episome copy number (less than threefold) appeared sufficient to trigger the gene-silenced phenotype...|$|E
30|$|In {{the process}} of {{preparing}} A. vera, the leaf skin is usually disposed of as waste, and aloe flower is also underestimated due to {{the small amount of}} origin from A. vera. The results from this work indicate that a considerable amount of polysaccharides is present in the skin juice, which is 2.4 times the level in gel juice; thus, we suggest that A. vera skin should be used fully for the extraction of polysaccharides rather than discarded. A. vera flower also contains an abundant amount of polysaccharides. However, the concentration of carbohydrates detected in the first ethanol-precipitated solid from the skin juice was rather low. This could be owing to the presence of co-precipitated protein and possible oxalate materials. Also, the polysaccharide solution extracted from aloe flower was more contaminated with protein and colored materials or phenolic compounds; thus, additional purification steps were necessary to remove these materials. Neutral polysaccharides accounted for 59.1 % and 79.8 % of the total recovered polysaccharide preparations for the skin and gel juices, respectively, with small amounts of acidic polysaccharides obtained after DEAE-Sephadex A- 25 anion-exchange chromatography. In contrast, the polysaccharides of A. vera flower were mainly composed of acidic polysaccharide (85.2 %). After further purification by gel permeation chromatography, component sugar analysis by gas–liquid chromatography indicated that there were significant differences between the neutral polysaccharides and acidic polysaccharides from different tissue zones of A. vera. In the neutral polysaccharides from the gel juice and <b>flower</b> <b>tissues,</b> glucose was the largest component, which accounted for around 81 % and 40 %, respectively.

Additionally, in the acidic polysaccharides detected in the experiment from the gel juice and <b>flower</b> <b>tissues,</b> galactose and glucose were the major monosacccharides, while the acidic polysaccharide from the skin tissue was mainly consisted of glucose and mannose. These results were broadly similar to those obtained for the gel polysaccharides of A. vera by Hikino et al.|$|R

Two of these of subunit molecular mass about 75 kDa and 200 kDa {{are associated with}} 3 -methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6. 4. 1. 4) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase activities (EC 6. 4. 1. 2) respectively. The third does not exhibit any of the biotin-dependent carboxylase activities found in higher organisms and represents the {{major part of the}} total protein-bound biotin in the seeds. This novel protein has been purified from a whole pea seed extract. Because in SDS/polyacrylamide gels the protein migrates with an apparent molecular mass of about 65 kDa, it is referred to as SBP 65, for 65 kDa seed biotinylated protein. The molecular mass of native SBP 65 is greater than 400 kDa, suggesting that the native protein assumes a polymeric structure, resulting from the association of six to eight identical subunits. The results of CNBr cleavage experiments suggest that biotin is covalently bound to the protein. The stoichiometry is 1 mol of biotin per 1 mol of 65 kDa polypeptide. The temporal and spatial pattern of expression of SBP 65 is described. SBP 65 is specifically expressed in the seeds, being absent from leaf, root, stem, pod and <b>flower</b> <b>tissues</b> of pea plants. The level of SBP 65 increases dramatically during seed development. The protein is not detectable in very young seeds. Its accumulation pattern parallels that for storage proteins, being maximally expressed in the mature dry seeds. SBP 65 disappears at a very high rate during seed germination. The level of free biotin has also been evaluated for various organs of pea plants. In all proliferating tissues examined (young developing seeds, leaf, root, stem, pod and <b>flower</b> <b>tissues),</b> free biotin is in excess of protein-bound biotin. Only in the mature dry seeds is protein-bound biotin (i. e. that bound to SBP 65) in excess of free biotin.

Recently, families of σ-factor genes {{have been identified in}} several plants including Arabidopsis. One of these genes, Arabidopsis SIG 5, encodes a σ-factor, AtSig 5, which is phylogenetically distinct from the other family members. To investigate the role of this plant σ-factor, two different insertional alleles of the SIG 5 gene were identified and characterized. Heterozygous mutant plants showed no visible leaf phenotype, but exhibited siliques containing aborted embryos and unfertilized ovules. Our inability to recover plants homozygous for a SIG 5 gene disruption indicates that SIG 5 is an essential gene. SIG 5 transcripts accumulate in <b>flower</b> <b>tissues,</b> consistent with a role for AtSig 5 protein in reproduction. Therefore, SIG 5 encodes an essential member of the Arabidopsis σ-factor family that plays a role in plant reproduction in addition to its previously proposed role in leaf chloroplast gene expression...|$|R
