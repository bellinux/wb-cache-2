50|$|Synaptosomes {{were first}} {{isolated}} {{in an attempt}} to identify the subcellular compartment corresponding to the fraction of so-called bound acetylcholine that remains when brain tissue is homogenized in <b>iso-osmotic</b> sucrose. Particles containing acetylcholine and its synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase were originally isolated by Hebb and Whittaker (1958) at the Agricultural Research Council, Institute of Animal Physiology, Babraham, Cambridge, UK. In a collaborative study with the electron microscopist George Gray from University College London, Victor P. Whittaker eventually showed that the acetylcholine-rich particles derived from guinea-pig cerebral cortex were synaptic vesicle-rich pinched-off nerve terminals. Whittaker coined the term synaptosome to describe these fractionation-derived particles and shortly thereafter synaptic vesicles could be isolated from lysed synaptosomes.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine cell glucose {{kinetics}} in rat skeletal muscle during <b>iso-osmotic</b> recovery from hyper- and hypo-osmotic stress. Rat EDL muscles were incubated for sixty minutes in either HYPO (190 mmol/kg), ISO (290 mmol/kg), or HYPER (400 mmol/kg) media (Sigma medium- 199, 8 mM glucose) according to an established in vitro whole muscle model. In addition to sixty minute baseline measures in aniso-osmotic conditions, (HYPO- 0 n= 8; ISO- 0, n=S; HYPER- 0, n= 8), muscles were subjected to either one minute (HYPO- 1 n= 8; ISO- 1, n= 8; HYPER- 1, n= 8) or five minutes (HYPO- 5 n= 8; ISO- 5, n= 8; HYPER- 5, n= 8) of <b>iso-osmotic</b> recovery media and analyzed for metabolite content and glycogen synthase percent activation.

In contrast, when worms are weighed six additional times during the 24 h interval, those maintained in <b>iso-osmotic</b> conditions lose weight, while those maintained in hypo-osmotic conditions gain weight. Worms which {{had been exposed to}} hypo-osmotic conditions and weighed at various times between 0 and 24 h exhibited an increase in weight which was correlated with the number of weighings. Worms exposed to hypo-osmotic conditions and weighed three additional times between 0 and 24 h also gained weight, and the OP of the PCF decreased such that worms experiencing the greatest increase in weight suffered the greatest dilution of the PCF. In worms ligatured at the head or tail or at the head and tail, and then exposed to either 15 % or 40 % ASW, the effect of multiple weighings is exaggerated in a complex way. The presence of a ligature on the tail in worms immersed in an <b>iso-osmotic</b> medium leads to an increase in weight and to a very marked additional increase in weight in worms immersed in a hypo-osmotic medium. The presence of a head ligature in worms in an <b>iso-osmotic</b> medium leads to a decrease in weight and to a smaller weight gain in a hypo-osmotic medium. The addition of a head ligature to worms ligatured at the tail increases the weight gain in both <b>iso-osmotic</b> and hypo-osmotic media.

40|$|Chemical tissue fixation, {{followed}} by embedding in either agarose or Fomblin, is {{common practice in}} time-intensive MRI studies of ex vivo biological samples, and is required to prevent tissue autolysis and sample motion. However, the combined effect of fixation and sample embedding may alter tissue structure and MRI properties. We investigated the progressive changes in T 1 and T 2 relaxation times, and the arrangement of locally prevailing cardiomyocyte orientation determined using diffusion tensor imaging, in embedded ex vivo rat hearts fixed using Karnovsky's solution (glutaraldehyde-formaldehyde mix). Three embedding media were investigated: (i) standard agarose (n= 3 hearts); (ii) Fomblin (n= 4 hearts); and (iii) <b>iso-osmotic</b> agarose (n= 3 hearts); in the latter, the osmolarity of the fixative and embedding medium was adjusted to 300 mOsm to match more closely that of native tissue. The T 1 relaxation time in the myocardium showed a pronounced decrease over a 48 -h period following embedding in Fomblin (- 11. 3 ± 6. 2 %; mean±standard deviation), but was stable in standard agarose- and <b>iso-osmotic</b> agarose-embedded hearts. The mean myocardial T 2 relaxation time increased in all embedded hearts: by 35. 1 ± 14. 7 % with standard agarose embedding, 13. 1 ± 5. 6 % with Fomblin and 13. 3 ± 1. 4 % with <b>iso-osmotic</b> agarose.

However, recent evidence on the diversity of functions of the alveolar macrophage suggests that the macro-phage {{is not a single}} population, but one composed of several subpopulations of macrophages.

To accomplish this, we developed a continuous gradient of <b>iso-osmotic</b> colloidal silica (Percoll) that separated alveolar macrophages from Fischer 344 rats into 18 density-defined subpopulations.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{role of an}} exocytotic, vesicular {{mechanism in}} cellular volume regulation under <b>iso-osmotic</b> conditions has been studied in slices of rat liver. The effects of incubation conditions and agents affecting the actin cytoskeleton were examined for changes of water, ionic composition, and ultrastructure. Slices were pre-incubated at 1 degrees C in an <b>iso-osmotic</b> buffered medium to induce swelling. Upon restoration to 37 degrees C in the same medium, tissue lost water. The Na+K+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) inhibitor ouabain inhibited water extrusion of about 50 %, an effect that was accompanied by the formation of characteristic vesicles in the cytoplasmic region between the Golgi apparatus and the bile canaliculi. Water extrusion {{in the presence of}} ouabain was partially inhibited by trifluoroperazine and completely inhibited when the medium was free of Ca 2 +. In the presence of ouabain, brefeldin A caused a small reduction of water extrusion, whereas phalloidin and cytochalasins A, D, or E caused a marked inhibition. In these conditions there was a marked increase in size and number of cytoplasmic vesicles and a more widespread distribution of them within the cells, lacking the more specific orientation to the Golgi and canalicular regions that was seen in the presence of ouabain alone. Water extrusion was inhibited by phalloidin and cytochalasins in the absence of ouabain. In conclusion, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that <b>iso-osmotic</b> expulsion of water from hepatocytes can proceed partly through an accumulation of water in cytoplasmic vesicles, followed by exocytosis.

40|$|Smith (1953) {{suggested}} {{that during the}} course of evolution, the transition between invertebrates and vertebrates occurred in the marine environment {{at the beginning of the}} paleozoic era. Much later, during the Silurian period, the hypothetical 'Protovertebrates' invaded brackish and fresh waters. In these media it is probable that their body fluids remained hyperosmotic to the external medium, although their osmolarity must have declined to a certain extent. Re-invasion of the sea occurred at the end of the palaeozoic era and re-adaptation of the body fluids to the hyperosmotic environment followed two different patterns according to whether the fishes emerging from the protovertebrate phylum were bony or cartilaginous fishes. While the former became hypo-osmotic regulators, the latter remained more or less <b>iso-osmotic</b> to their environment. To keep the osmolarity of the body fluids at the same level as that evolved during freshwater adaptation, the teleosts developed an extrarenal salt excretion mechanism in their gills.

The results demonstrated that full imbibition of rice seeds occurred at around 30 % moisture content (mc) {{and the critical}} mc for germination was around 25 - 30 %. Although rates of water uptake in rice seeds were reduced with increasing salinity, rice seeds attained full imbibition by 48 h up to 150 mM salinity and reached at least critical mc by 72 h up to 250 mM salinity. Water uptakes in NaCl solutions were greater than in <b>iso-osmotic</b> solutions of PEG and rice seeds did not attain even critical mc in PEG solutions lower than - 0. 232 MPa even after 72 h.

When exposed to osmotic stress, clustering of vaccine particles was enhanced in an acidic medium (pH 2. 0) at ≥ 25 °C.

In two control groups the VMH was perfused either with (a) an <b>iso-osmotic</b> solution lacking glucose, or with (b) nonmetabolizable L-glucose (100 mM).

A relatively low-fiber and highly absorbable diet may facilitate the intestinal cleansing and loop relaxation fundamental for laparoscopic surgery with a lower dose of <b>iso-osmotic</b> laxative. Methods: From 1 February 2004 to 30 July 2005, 28 patients referred to our unit with colon disease (neoplasms and diverticular disease) amenable to laparoscopic surgery were prospectively randomized into two groups of 14 patients each. For 6 days preoperatively, the patients in group I were given 750 ml/day of a diet enriched with arginine. omega- 3 fatty acids [...] and ribonucleic acid (RNA) associated with low-fiber foods. They had I day of intestinal preparation with 31 of <b>iso-osmotic</b> laxative. On postoperative day 2, they were fed orally with the same diet. The patients in group 2 preoperatively received a low-fiber diet. They had 2 days of preparation with <b>iso-osmotic</b> laxative (3 l/day). On postoperative day 3, oral nutrition was restored. Intraoperatively, we evaluated loop relaxation and intestinal cleanliness. Clinical trends were monitored in both groups, as well as adverse reactions to early nutrition. The nutritional (albumin, prealbumin) and immunologic (lymphocyte subpopulations, immunoglobulins) biohumoral parameters were evaluated at the first visit, on the day before surgery, on postoperative day 7, and 1 month after surgery. Results: The two groups did not differ in terms of age, gender, distribution of disease, or baseline anthropometric, biohumoral, or immunologic parameters.

A comparison of successive hypo- and <b>iso-osmotic</b> extractions of the endoneurium revealed that the hypo-osmotic extraction released increasing amounts of P 0 into the supernatant fraction, whereas the <b>iso-osmotic</b> treatment revealed lower levels of P 0 extracted from the myelin and lesser amounts with each successive extraction. Three successive hypo-osmotic extractions resulted in a 2. 0 -, 2. 9 -, and 9. 5 -fold increase in the amount of P 0 released compared with the successive <b>iso-osmotic</b> extractions. Although these results suggest that this major myelin glycoprotein has properties similar to those of extrinsic membrane proteins, temperature-dependent phase-partitioning experiments with Triton X- 114 revealed that this glycoprotein is recovered in the detergent-enriched lower phase. These results indicate that this major myelin glycoprotein is an amphipathic integral membrane protein with a distinct hydrophobic domain and yet has solubility characteristics typical of an extrinsic membrane protein. P 0 labelled in vitro with [3 H]mannose could be immunoprecipitated from the aqueous supernatant with anti-P 0 gamma-globulin by centrifugation at 197000 g without the addition of second antibody or protein A. Analysis of such an immune precipitate after incorporation in vitro with [14 C]acetate to label endoneurial lipids revealed that all major endoneurial lipid classes contained radioactive label, as determined by fluorography after high-performance t. l. c.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of low ambient calcium levels, prolactin cell activity {{is directly related to}} the height of the osmotic gradient between blood plasma and external medium, and not to ambient osmolarity. Prolactin cell activity is minimal in fish adapted to <b>iso-osmotic</b> saline. The osmotic water permeability of the gills is inversely related to the height of the osmotic gradient and to prolactin cell activity. In gills of fish from <b>iso-osmotic</b> saline the osmotic water permeability is maximal. This high permeability is reduced after injection of ovine prolactin. It is concluded that the rate of prolactin secretion is related directly to the rate of the osmotic water fluxes—and. possibly, passive ion fluxes — the fish are facing, irrespective of the direction of these fluxes. In {{the presence}} of high calcium levels, however, prolactin cell activity as well as osmotic water permeability of the gills were low and independent of ambient osmolarity. Prolactin injections did not influence the osmotic water permeability of gills from high-calcium-adapted fish. High prolactin secretion in freshwater-adapted fish is likely due to {{the presence of}} low environmental calcium levels and a high osmotic gradient between blood and environment. Low prolactin secretion in seawater fish — fish that are facing an even higher osmotic gradient—is probably caused by the high ambient calcium an...|$|E
40|$|The halotolerant alga Dunaliella salina {{grows in}} saline {{conditions}} {{as varied as}} 0. 5 and 5 M NaCl, maintaining throughout this range a low intracellular ion concentration. To discover factors potentially involved in ionic homeostasis, we grew cells in media with different salinities or osmolarities and compared their protein profiles. The comparisons indicated {{that the amount of}} a 60 -kD protein, p 60, greatly increased with an increase in salinity and was moderately enhanced when NaCl was substituted with <b>iso-osmotic</b> glycerol. Cells transferred from low to high NaCl or from high glycerol to <b>iso-osmotic</b> NaCl media transiently ceased to grow, and resumption of growth coincided approximately with an increase in p 60. The protein, extracted from a plasma membrane fraction, was purified to homogeneity. Anti-p 60 antibodies cross-reacted with a 60 -kD protein in Dunaliella bardawil. Immunoelectron microscopy of D. salina cell sections indicated that p 60 was exclusively located in the plasma membrane. Its induction by salt, the correlation between its accumulation and growth resumption in high concentrations of salt, and its plasma membrane localization suggest the possibility that p 60 could play a role in ionic homeostasis in conditions of high salinity, although different types of function could also be considered...|$|E
40|$|Carbamoylcholine stimulated phosphatidylinositol {{breakdown}} in rat parotid-gland fragments incubated {{in either a}} Krebs [...] Ringer medium or an ion-depleted <b>iso-osmotic</b> sucrose medium. This suggest that phosphatidylinositol breakdown is not initiated by {{a change in the}} intracellular concentration of Na+ or of K+, and previous experiments have already indicated that it is independent of cyclic nucleotides and Ca 2 +. Thus it seems that this reaction may be initiated by a direct interaction at the plasma membrane between the activated muscarinic cholinergic receptor system and the enzyme that catalyses phosphatidylinositol breakdown...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the effect on the}} osmotic activation of rat liver lysosomes, by glucose penetration, of different substances known to inhibit the glucose transport through the plasma membrane. Diethylstilbestrol is the most efficient, particularly when purified lysosomes are used. It has no effect on osmotic activation induced by hypo-osmotic sucrose or by <b>iso-osmotic</b> KCl. It is proposed that diethylstilbestrol reacts with specific sites involved in the glucose translocation through the lysosomal membrane. These sites could not be identified by binding experiments, presumably owing to the considerable unspecific binding of the compound to the membrane...|$|E
