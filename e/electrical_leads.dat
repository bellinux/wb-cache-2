The excess semiconductor from under the beams was removed, thereby separating the individual devices and leaving them with self-supporting beam leads or internal chiplets cantilevered beyond the semiconductor.

50|$|The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors {{suggests}} that CNTs could replace Cu in microelectronic interconnects, owing to their low scattering, high current-carrying capacity, {{and resistance to}} electromigration. For this, vias comprising tightly packed (>1013 cmâˆ’2) metallic CNTs with low defect density and low contact resistance are needed. Recently, {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS)-compatible 150-nm-diameter interconnects with a single CNT-contact hole resistance of 2.8 kOhm were demonstrated on full 200-mm-diameter wafers. Also, as a replacement for solder bumps, CNTs can function both as <b>electrical</b> <b>leads</b> and heat dissipaters for use in high-power amplifiers.|$|E

50|$|Ultimately, the electroceuticals quest aims to {{find the}} electro-neural {{signature}} of disease and at a cellular level, in real time, play back the more normal electro-signature to help maintain the neural signature in the normal state. Unlike preceding neuromodulation therapy methods, the approach would not involve <b>electrical</b> <b>leads</b> stimulating large nerves or spinal cords or brain centers. It might involve methods that are emerging within the neuromodulation family of therapies, such as optogenetics or some new nanotechnology.

5000|$|A squib is a {{miniature}} explosive device {{used in a}} wide range of industries, from special effects to military applications. It resembles a tiny stick of dynamite, both in appearance and construction, although with considerably less explosive power. Squibs consist of two <b>electrical</b> <b>leads</b> which are separated by a plug of insulating material, a small bridge wire or electrical resistance heater, and a bead of heat-sensitive chemical composition in which the bridge wire is embedded. [...] Squibs can be used for generating mechanical force, or to provide pyrotechnic effects for both film and live theatrics. Squibs can be used for shattering or propelling a variety of materials.|$|E
50|$|As a rule, the {{projectors}} were sited out in {{the open}} some little way behind the front line so that digging, aiming (either by direct line of sight or by compass) and wiring up the <b>electrical</b> <b>leads</b> were easier. When camouflaged the positions would be unknown to the enemy so that although the enemy was able to recognise the direction of the location by the discharge flash he would be uncertain of the range. As such these installations could only be carried out at night. The digging of the narrow trenches did not involve much labour and later in the war the projectors were only buried to a depth of about a foot, instead of up to their muzzles.|$|E
5000|$|The rocket {{body was}} a steel tube 3 in in {{diameter}} filled with 11 pounds (5 kg) of cordite propellant, fired electrically. The warhead was screwed into the forward end, and was initially a solid 25 lb, 3.44 in armor-piercing shell which was quickly supplemented by a 6-inch-diameter (152mm), 60 lb high-explosive head. Another type of head was a 25 lb (11 kg) mild steel (later concrete) practice head.

50|$|A July 1971 coroner's inquest {{found that}} Elmer Crawford murdered {{his wife and}} three {{children}} in their Glenroy home.

He attached the alligator clips to his wife's ears while she slept and electrocuted her. He then beat his children to death, presumably using a hammer, then loaded their bodies into the family's FE Holden vehicle. He then drove them 200 km to Port Campbell where he pushed the car containing the bodies over the cliff edge in an effort to make the crime look like murder-suicide.|$|R

50|$|Spinal cord {{stimulation}} {{is a form}} of neuromodulation {{therapy in}} common use since the 1980s. Its principal use is as a reversible, non-pharmacological therapy for chronic pain management that delivers mild electrical pulses to the spinal cord. In patients who experience pain reduction of 50 percent or more during a temporary trial, a permanent implant may be offered in which, as with a cardiac pacemaker, an implantable pulse generator {{about the size of a}} stopwatch is placed under the skin on the trunk. It delivers mild impulses along slender <b>electrical</b> <b>leads</b> leading to small electrical contacts, about the size of a grain of rice, at the area of the spine to be stimulated.|$|E
50|$|A current {{integrator}} is {{an electronic}} device performing a time integration {{of an electric}} current, thus measuring a total electric charge.

A current integrator is also used to measure the electric charge on a Faraday cup in a residual gas analyzer to measure partial pressures of gasses in a vacuum. Another application of current integration is in ion beam deposition, where the measured charge directly corresponds to the number of ions deposited on a substrate, assuming the charge state of the ions is known. The two current-carrying <b>electrical</b> <b>leads</b> must to be connected to the ion source and the substrate, closing the electric circuit which in part is given by the ion beam.|$|E
5000|$|Class leader EC 7 {{along with}} EO 3 was {{donated to the}} Tramway Historical Society upon withdrawal. Stored in the Linwood {{locomotive}} depot, the locomotive was transported to Ferrymead by road in 1972, where it nearly ran away during the unloading operation. The two electric locomotives were stored by the tramway section until 1977 when the THS handed the two locomotives over to the Ferrymead Railway-based Electric Traction Group. Both locomotives were shifted onto the railway tracks using <b>electrical</b> <b>leads</b> off the 600V DC tramway overhead and several tracksets, which were moved with the locomotives to the railway. In 1978, part of the Ferrymead line at Moorhouse station was fitted with overhead catenary and in 1980, some test runs were done with EC 7 at 600V using the tramway power supply. This led to the acquisition of three mercury-arc rectifiers to power the railway, {{as well as the}} trams and trolley-buses.|$|E
