The common processes for recovery of gold solution includes: (I) Carbon adsorption, Merrill-Crowe process, (II) electro winning and (III) ion-exchange / solvent extraction.

Amalgamation with mercury was used to enhance recovery, often by adding it directly to the riffle tables, and mercury is still widely used in small diggings across the world. However, froth flotation processes may {{also be used to}} concentrate the gold. In some cases, particularly when the gold is present in the ore as discrete coarse particles, a gravity concentrate can be directly smelted to form gold bars. In other cases, particularly when the gold is present in the ore as fine particles or is not sufficiently liberated from the host rock, the concentrates are treated with cyanide salts, a process known as cyanidation leaching, followed by recovery from the leach solution. Recovery from solution typically involves adsorption on activated carbon then stripping (eluting) the gold from the carbon and passing the pregnant solution through electrowinning and then onto the smelting process.|$|E
