5|$|As Upper Canada's administrator, Brock made {{a series}} of changes to prepare for war. He amended the militia act to allow use of all {{available}} volunteers and ordered enhanced training of these raw recruits, despite opposition from the provincial legislature.

Although the conventional wisdom of the day was that Canada would fall quickly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> an invasion, Brock pursued these strategies to give the colony a fighting chance.|$|E
5|$|Between 1962 and 1992 {{there was}} a {{hardened}} nuclear bunker, built for No 16 Group Royal Observer Corps Shrewsbury, who provided the field force of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation and would have sounded the four-minute warning alarm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> war and warned the population of Shrewsbury <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> approaching radioactive fallout.

After the breakup of the communist bloc in 1989, the Royal Observer Corps was disbanded between September 1991 and December 1995.
