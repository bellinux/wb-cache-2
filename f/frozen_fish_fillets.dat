Evidence from the available literature shows that food safety standards and other non-tariff measures can act as trade barriers. Using an extension of the price-wedge method that takes into account imperfect substitution and factor endowment in monopolistic competition, this study provides ad valorem tariff equivalent of several international food safety standards. We apply this method to panel data of European imports of fruit, vegetables and fish from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. Empirical results show that the tariff equivalent is about 36 per cent for avocados, ranges from 40 to 92 per cent for fresh peas and green beans and goes from 12 to 190 per cent for <b>frozen</b> <b>fish</b> <b>fillet.</b> In addition, we observe a strong home-good preference of more than 99 per cent for <b>frozen</b> <b>fish</b> <b>fillet</b> and an important variation of the tariff equivalent for all the products among the EU importing countries and over time...|$|R

40|$|Adequate glazing (6 – 10 %) of {{fish fillets}} prior to frozen storage protects {{the final product}} from dehydration, {{oxidation}} and quality loss. Excessive glazing (> 12 %) {{on the other hand}} may significantly affect the economic value and end user satisfaction of <b>frozen</b> <b>fish</b> <b>fillets.</b> This paper describes the optimization, validation and application of a gravimetric procedure for the quantification of the ice-glaze content of <b>frozen</b> <b>fish</b> <b>fillets</b> (accredited under ISO 17025). This procedure has been utilized to determine the glazing percentage of multiple batches (n  =  50) of 11 different fish species sampled from 2005 until 2009. Average glazing percentages were 8. 7  ±  2. 0 % for the pooled samples (n  =  712), and ranged between 6. 6  ±  2. 2 % (salmon/cod) and 10. 6  ±  1. 6 % (plaice). The lower threshold value of 6 % glazing for sufficient protection was violated in only one batch, whereas none of the batches exceeded the 12 % excessive glazing threshold. The annual market place value of one %-point glazing is estimated at 1 million Euro in a low to moderate fish consumption market like Belgium. The large variability of glazing, combined with this technology's possible implications with respect to end-product-quality and economic value urges for technology improvement, monitoring and more controlled application of the glazing process in the frozen fish industry...|$|E

30|$|Asian sea bass, {{also known}} as {{barramundi}} (Lates calcarifer), is the predominant fish species used for coastal aquaculture in Thailand. It is a significant fishery commodity representing 10 % of all seafood production. Asian sea bass production increased by 51 % from 8004 metric tons in 2001 to 16, 501 tons in 2014 {{as reported by the}} Thailand Department of Fisheries (DOF 2016). Farmed sea bass is normally sold as whole fish at 500 – 700  g for local markets, with a retail price of 150 baht/kg (4.50 USD/kg).

Despite these trade preferences, ACP countries have not improved accordingly their trade performance into the EU. There {{is a growing concern}} emerging through the literature that non-tariff measures (NTMs) could constitute a serious handicap to the full participation of these developing countries in the multilateral trading system. In this context, the present dissertation provides first an ad valorem tariff equivalent of a set of public and private-sector NTMs applied by the EU countries on horticultural and fish imports from East African countries. Using the price-wedge method in a context of imperfect substitution of Armington (1969) and differences in factor endowment, we find tariff equivalents averaging between 40 and 60 per cent for horticultural products and exceeding 200 per cent for <b>frozen</b> <b>fish</b> <b>fillets</b> during the EU ban period. Second, using a gravity model from Anderson and van Wincoop (2004) where our generated tariff equivalent is taken as a component of trade costs, we find that the European NTMs do not affect trade of green beans but significantly reduce imports of <b>frozen</b> <b>fish</b> <b>fillets.</b> Third, we conceptualize a stylized Nash (1950) bargaining game and show that Kenyan small-scale horticultural farms are likely to be excluded from the certified export supply chain following high compliance costs with stringent standards. Empirically, we show through a bivariate probit estimation that contracting decision is strongly linked to credit access. Finally, interesting policy implications of our results and suggestions for future research areas are outlined. (AGRO 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{antimicrobial}} metabolites produced by Lactobacillus casei DSM 120011 (A) and Lactobacillus acidophilus 1 M (B) individually and in combination on quality attributes of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fillets was studied during frozen storage. The {{results showed that}} the combination treatment in particular at concentration of 2 % slightly increased pH values and decreased both total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) and trimethylamine nitrogen (TMA-N) contents. In addition, thibarbituric acid (TBA) value markedly decreased in all samples treated with investigated metabolites as compared with the control sample throughout different frozen storage periods. On the other hand, there was a good antibacterial activity of the investigated metabolites on the total viabl count (TVC) when used separately, but the activity highly increased by combination of the two extracts. Furthermore, the metabolite (A) was highly effective against Staphylococuus aureus, E. coli (at 2 % concentration) and yeasts. The combination trial increased the activity against coliform bacteria relatively. Moreover, the metabolite (B) was more active against molds during 45 and 90 days of storage.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Along {{the last}} ten years fish and fishery product trade in Brazil has been on a {{downward}} trajectory turning a profit of US$ 98. 6 million in 2005 into a loss of US$ 1. 25 billion by 2014. On the other hand, the country is a leading producer of grains and has the third largest animal feed industry in the world, which has added 5. 5 million hectares of freshwater reservoirs and 3. 5 million km 2 of an exclusive marine economic zone in the same period, a sizable potential for development of the aquaculture industry. This study aims at unveiling strategies for the reduction of the deficit in the Brazilian seafood trade balance, based on critical analysis of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of imported fishery products. The fish and fishery product trade in Brazil, from 2005 to 2015, was studied considering import and export data mined from the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry and Commerce databases through the Aliceweb system, and clustered as follows: processing; product species; origin; conservation; and group. The main imported products were gutted fresh fish, highest price (salmon); salted dried fish, higher price (cod); <b>frozen</b> <b>fish</b> <b>fillets,</b> lowest price (fish and hake). The replacement of fish imports by domestic production is not enough to enable consumers to identify the equivalence between products (technical, qualitative or organoleptic). Developing strategies for the production of fish and fishery products at competitive prices and quantities that meet consumer demand is an immediate need, and the development of the aquaculture industry a rational strategy...|$|E

This organism was isolated from 16. 67 % of IQF squid, 8. 82 % of frozen prawns, 2. 38 % of frozen squid and 2 % of IQF prawns. In general 3. 34 % of the samples {{were found to be}} carriers of V. metschnikovii. All samples of <b>frozen</b> <b>fish</b> <b>fillets,</b> frozen cuttle fish, frozen octo-pus were found to be free from this organism. Informatioin regarding the inci-dence of this organism in fish product is scanty. Hence this observation may be relevant to public health considerations of seafood consumption. Vibrio spp. are important, being pathogenic for animals or man with food as the vehicle of transmission (Desmarchelier, 1984). Out of thirty spe-cies of Vibrios at present defined and characterized, only 12 have been impli-cated in human infections (Hansen et al., 1993). V. metschnikovii, an oxidase-negative and nitrate negative species was described initially by Lee et al., 1978. The organism was first recovered from human disease by Jean et al. (1981) and several other instances of infection have been reported (Buck, 1991; Hansen et al., 1993). This bacterium has also been iso-lated from food borne disease outbreaks involving shrimps and crab (Farmer et al., 1998). V. metschnikovii was reported in finfish by Lee et al. (1978) subsequently it was isolated from fresh shellfish and finfishes (Buck, 1991; Prasad and Rao, 1994). Information regarding the inci-dence of this organism in frozen fish prod-uct is scanty.
