50|$|The general {{outlines}} of a <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>model</b> {{emerged during the}} post-war boom. Tony Judt lists a number of causes: the abandonment of protectionism, the baby boom, cheap energy, {{and a desire to}} catch up with living standards enjoyed in the United States. The <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>model</b> also enjoyed a low degree of external competition as the Soviet bloc, China and India were not yet integrated into the global economy. In recent years, it has become common to question whether the <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>model</b> is sustainable in the face of low birthrates, globalisation, Europeanisation and an ageing population.|$|E

An insight into the economic situation of all <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>models</b> emphasizes that the Nordic model has the highest efficiency {{in terms of economic}} results. The states that belong to the scandinavian model are characterized by stable economic growth, strong social democracy, a strong trade union movement, low levels of corruption and universality of the system that helps companies to overcome difficult moments. This paper highlights the micro and macroeconomic policies that have led to economic stability and very good results in terms of living standards. The main hypothesis of the paper assumes that investments in education and workforce improvement led to the growth of the living standards in the Scandinavian model...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is {{research}} and analyses of the dimensions of pension adequacy in Latvia and the deficiencies of the current social protection and old-age pensions {{in the light of}} the various <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>models</b> and their origins. In order to reduce poverty and social exclusion, in all <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>models</b> it is essential for the governments to take active part and support the basic elements- pensions, health and long-term care, social protection of the poor and the disabled, and tax redistribution. The task of each pension scheme is providing the contributor the possibility to maintain his/her standard of living also after retiring. By ensuring sufficient level of income replaceability, the risk of poverty among older people is minimized. Yet the comparatively new pension systems of the East- European countries, as well the pension system of Latvia, lack this ability. The analyses of the author highlight the need to review the design of the Latvian pension system and to find the right balance between PAYG (Pay-As-You-Go) systems and fully funded systems. In comparison with other European countries, the replacement ratio in Latvia is one of the lowest within the EU 27 countries. Other important vice of the Latvian pension system, which especially influences the income of single pensioners, is the inability to inherit the accumulated capital within the state obligatory funded pension scheme...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSocial policy {{development}} of the European Union has become an increasingly important aspect which EU takes in defining and implementing any policy. The aim of regional policy is cohesion and economic development for all countries. Different scientific sources claims that the welfare state model {{has to be taken}} into account with high priority, because social costs, that are dedicated to reduce the economic divine, are raising economic potential, and contribute to the economic development and cohesion. The new EU members are changing the types of <b>social</b> <b>models</b> because of integration to the economy of European Union. Some authors noted that the number of <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>models</b> is increasing. The literature about welfare state model was reviewed in this paper. Also statistical analysis was applied for socio - economic indicators in different EU states identifying <b>social</b> <b>model</b> clusters and statistical differences.

40|$|This paper explores <b>social</b> <b>models</b> in Europe with {{focus on}} the new EU Member States in a {{comparative}} perspective. The analysis is based on indicators representing the main tasks of <b>social</b> <b>models.</b> Principal components analysis yields three synthetic factors that reflect these tasks: the factor labour market security captures the flexibility and income security on labour markets. It might be interpreted {{as an indicator of}} flexicurity which plays a dominant role in the modernization of <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>models</b> as envisaged by the Lisbon strategy. Further factors are social equity and personal responsibility; the latter characterizing the trade-off between the usage of welfare transfers and the regulat-ing power of liberal employment protection. These components give rise to five country groups which however only partially coincide with the regional clustering proposed in the literature. Most of the new EU-member states together with Italy and Greece form a group of their own which is characterised by low labour market security and low per-sonal responsibility. ...|$|R

40|$|We compare {{labor market}} policies, {{institutions}} and outcomes for the EU member states, {{for the period}} 2000 - 2005. We document the main differences in Labor Market Policies across EU members, including new member states after 2004. We focus on indicators of policy generosity (expenditures relative to GDP) and relate these and other policy indicators to indicators of labor market outcomes and performance. Our results show that, on a cross-country basis, higher rates of employment are in general associated with: (i) higher expenditures on labor market policies, especially on active policies for countries with a high pro-work attitude; (ii) a lower degree of rigidity in labor market institutions and in product market regulation. labor market policies, labor market outcomes, <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>models...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{national}} education {{systems of the}} European Union Member States operate in a rather unique framework which sees EU level monitoring and creation of benchmarks {{in the framework of}} the Lisbon Agenda interact with national priorities and social characteristics. This paper examines the use of benchmarking in education and training and the presence of different performance levels of groups of countries, using Sapir¿s <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>models</b> classification. There is, in fact, evidence for consistent trends of similar performance within groups and clear distinction of performance levels between groups of countries. This gives indication for the existence of strong structural differences and implies that one-size-fits-all policies do not necessarily respond to the specific characteristics and needs of different countries.

50|$|Despite a {{doubling}} {{in the number}} of hospital beds and doctors per capita between 1950 and 1980, the lack of money that had been going into health was patently obvious. Some of the smaller hospitals had no radiology services, and a few had inadequate heating or water. A 1989 survey found that 20% of Russian hospitals did not have piped hot water and 3% did not even have piped cold water. 7% did not have a telephone. 17% lacked adequate sanitation facilities. Every seventh hospital and polyclinic needed basic reconstruction. Five years after the reforms described below per capita spending on health care was still a meagre US$158 per year (about 8 times less than the average <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>models</b> in Spain, the United Kingdom and Finland, and 26 times less than that of the U.S. which spent US$4,187 at that time).|$|R
50|$|The {{three major}} {{political}} forces in France (UMP, PS and UDF) supported the proposed Constitution, as did president Chirac.

50|$|Flexicurity is {{also seen}} {{as a way to}} {{preserve}} the <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>model</b> while maintaining and improving the competitiveness of the European Union. It is argued that, in the context of globalisation and technological change which place greater demands on business to adapt continuously, high levels of employment security will not depend only on protection of workers' specific job, but mainly on the means for workers to stay on the job market, manage smooth transitions between jobs, and make progress in their careers.|$|E
5000|$|The Guardian {{described}} TTIP as [...] "the {{most controversial}} trade deal the EU has ever negotiated". TTIP negotiations are criticized and opposed by some unions, charities, NGOs and environmentalists, particularly in Europe. The Independent summarizes {{the negative impact}} of TTIP as [...] "reducing the regulatory barriers to trade for big business, things like food safety law, environmental legislation, banking regulations and the sovereign powers of individual nations", or more critically as an [...] "assault on European and US societies by transnational corporations". German economist Max Otte stated that the proposed (ISDS) court of arbitration and protection of foreign investment would mean a [...] "complete dis-empowerment of politics" [...] and that, regarding labour economics, free trade agreements typically enforce lower standards and that TTIP would put European workers into direct competition with Americans (and in effect because of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexicans), which would impact <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>models.</b>|$|R
40|$|Many {{social policy}} reforms {{have been carried}} out in Europe in the last fifteen years. Most of these reforms are marginal. Often they are {{mutually}} inconsistent. Yet, something is changing in the <b>European</b> <b>social</b> policy landscape and not in the direction implied by the presence of a 'race to the bottom' in social welfare provision. There are no signs of convergence of <b>social</b> policy <b>models</b> across Europe. Further reforms will have to be respectful of the initial conditions, that is, they necessarily have to adapt to the various Social Europes. By imposing the same pattern of reforms to the different <b>European</b> <b>social</b> policy <b>models</b> there is a high risk of jeopardizing reform efforts altogether. An additional reason for not imposing a single <b>European</b> <b>social</b> policy <b>model</b> is that <b>social</b> policy reforms need to be comprehensive, hence they should necessarily work on country-specific institutional clusters. All this makes a strong case for maintaining EU-level decision-making on social policy reforms under unanimity rule. Majority voting on these issues is likely to involve strong pressures to harmonize institutions, while some countries will always be in a minority. One country may receive the worst of each welfare system and make the furthering and broadening of the scope of reforms even more difficult. Monetary Union; Race To The Bottom; Social Europe...|$|R
40|$|The general {{adoption}} of austerity policies throughout the EU {{and in particular}} in the eurozone is having very adverse effects {{on the level of}} employment, on job and employment security and on working conditions. These effects are also highly differentiated, being especially intense in the countries facing sovereign debt crises. The following paper presents some evidence for the countries in question drawn primarily from the stability programmes and national reform programmes which member states are required to submit each year to the Commission. The present paper first gives {{a brief description of the}} new policy surveillance system in the eurozone.

The implications of austerity policies for workers are discussed; young workers are clearly badly affected.
