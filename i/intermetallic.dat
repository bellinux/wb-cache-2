5|$|The metal {{is readily}} {{attacked}} by most acids. Sulfuric acid is a notable exception because passivation stops the reaction by forming the insoluble barium sulfate on the surface.

5|$|Among {{the lighter}} metalloids, alloys with {{transition}} metals are well-represented. Boron can form <b>intermetallic</b> compounds and alloys with such metals {{of the composition}} MnB, if n > 2. Ferroboron (15% boron) is used to introduce boron into steel; nickel-boron alloys are ingredients in welding alloys and case hardening compositions for the engineering industry. Alloys of silicon with iron and with aluminium are widely used by the steel and automotive industries, respectively. Germanium forms many alloys, most importantly with the coinage metals.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the Ca2+ ion, high {{coordination}} numbers are common, up to 24 in some <b>intermetallic</b> compounds such as CaZn13. Calcium is readily complexed by oxygen chelates such as EDTA and polyphosphates, which are useful in analytic chemistry and removing calcium ions from hard water. In the absence of steric hindrance, smaller group 2 cations tend to form stronger complexes, but when large polydentate macrocycles are involved the trend is reversed.|$|E

40|$|<b>Intermetallics</b> are {{receiving}} increasing attention for applications requiring high-leverage materials possessing potentially high pay-offs {{such as in}} gas-turbine engines. While the quasistatic deformation response of {{a broad range of}} <b>intermetallics</b> is receiving intense scientific and engineering study increased utilization of <b>intermetallics</b> under dynamic loading requires an understanding of their high-rate / shock-wave behavior. In this paper the influence of shock loading on the structure / property behavior of Ti- 48 Al- 2 Cr- 2 Nb and Ti- 24 Al- 11 Nb is presented. The reload constitutive response of both shock-loaded <b>intermetallics</b> supports the dynamic deformation of both <b>intermetallics</b> being controlled by a Peierls mechanism.

The result was a cheap strong light steel alloy—nearly as strong as titanium at 10% of the cost—which is slated for trial production at industrial scale by POSCO, a Korean steelmaker.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium also {{exhibits}} valence states {{between 3 and 7}} inclusive, {{and thus}} is chemically similar to neptunium and uranium. It is highly reactive, and quickly forms an oxide film in air. Plutonium reacts with hydrogen even at temperatures as low as 25–50°C; it also easily forms halides and <b>intermetallic</b> compounds. Hydrolysis reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse. Plutonium(V) can enter polymerization reactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} form many <b>intermetallic</b> {{compounds}} {{with each other}} and the elements from groups 2 to 13 in the periodic table of varying stoichiometries, such as the sodium amalgams with mercury, including Na5Hg8 and Na3Hg. Some of these have ionic characteristics: taking the alloys with gold, the most electronegative of metals, as an example, NaAu and KAu are metallic, but RbAu and CsAu are semiconductors. NaK is an alloy of sodium and potassium that is very useful because it is liquid at room temperature, although precautions must be taken due to its extreme reactivity towards water and air. The eutectic mixture melts at −12.6°C. An alloy of 41% caesium, 47% sodium, and 12% potassium has the lowest known melting point of any metal or alloy, −78°C.|$|E

5|$|The <b>intermetallic</b> {{compounds}} of the {{alkali metals}} with the heavier group 13 elements (aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium), such as NaTl, are poor conductors or semiconductors, unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements, {{implying that the}} alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the Zintl anions involved. Nevertheless, while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters, group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice. For example, NaTl consists of a polymeric anion (—Tl−—)n with a covalent diamond cubic structure with Na+ ions located between the anionic lattice. The larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form anionic clusters.|$|E
5|$|Silver also forms alloys {{with most}} other {{elements}} on the periodic table. The elements from groups 1–3, except for hydrogen, lithium, and beryllium, are very miscible with {{silver in the}} condensed phase and form <b>intermetallic</b> compounds; those from groups 4–9 are only poorly miscible; the elements in groups 10–14 (except boron and carbon) have very complex Ag–M phase diagrams and form the most commercially important alloys; and the remaining elements on the periodic table have no consistency in their Ag–M phase diagrams. By far the most important such alloys are those with copper: most silver used for coinage and jewellery is in reality a silver–copper alloy, and the eutectic mixture is used in vacuum brazing. The two metals are completely miscible as liquids but not as solids; their importance in industry {{comes from the fact}} that their properties tend to be suitable over a wide range of variation in silver and copper concentration, although most useful alloys tend to be richer in silver than the eutectic mixture (71.9% silver and 28.1% copper by weight, and 60.1% silver and 28.1% copper by atom).|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react readily with {{phosphorus}} and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M3Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth). This {{is due to}} the greater size of the P3− and As3− ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K3P, K4P3, K5P4, KP, K4P6, K3P7, K3P11, KP10.3, and KP15. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3− ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine (SbH3). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are <b>intermetallic</b> compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.|$|E
40|$|Iron is one {{of common}} {{impurities}} in 206 alloys and detrimental platelet-like iron <b>intermetallics</b> can easily form at high iron contents resulted from {{the increasing use of}} recycled aluminum alloys.

The results show that there are three major types of iron <b>intermetallics</b> according to their morphologies: platelet-like, block and Chinese script.

40|$|A {{requirement}} for good wire bonding is {{the existence of}} <b>intermetallics</b> between the gold ball and bond pad. A digital image of {{the surface of the}} gold ball that was attached to the bond pad was obtained and analysed with MATLAB.

Four experiments were performed to investigate the reliability of CM, the effect of light-offset, and the performance of a quality assistant (QA) in his ability to visually estimate (the visual method) the <b>intermetallics</b> coverage. The main results indicate that the visual method is inconsistent and less accurate than the counting method.

40|$|AbstractThe phase stability, elastic {{properties}} and electronic structures of three typical Mg–Y <b>intermetallics</b> including Mg 24 Y 5, Mg 2 Y and MgY are systematically investigated using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The optimized structural parameters including lattice constants and atomic coordinates {{are in good}} agreement with experimental values. The calculated cohesive energies and formation enthalpies show that either phase stability or alloying ability of the three <b>intermetallics</b> is gradually enhanced with increasing Y content. The single-crystal elastic constants Cij of Mg–Y <b>intermetallics</b> are also calculated, and the bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, Young's modulus E, Poisson ratio v and anisotropy factor A of polycrystalline materials are derived. It is suggested that the resistances to volume and shear deformation {{as well as the}} stiffness of the three <b>intermetallics</b> are raised with increasing Y content. Besides, these <b>intermetallics</b> all exhibit ductile characteristics, and they are isotropic in compression but anisotropic to a certain degree in shear and stiffness. Comparatively, Mg 24 Y 5 presents a relatively higher ductility, while MgY has a relatively stronger anisotropy in shear and stiffness. Further analysis of electronic structures indicates that the phase stability of Mg–Y <b>intermetallics</b> is closely related with their bonding electrons numbers below Fermi level. Namely, the more bonding electrons number below Fermi level corresponds to the higher structural stability of Mg–Y <b>intermetallics...</b>|$|R
