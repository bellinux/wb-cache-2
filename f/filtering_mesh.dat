40|$|Abstract A {{new system}} is {{described}} for sampling mesozooplankton over extended spatial scales. This system, called the U-Tow, is small (- 1 m long), can be towed {{at high speed}} (> 10 knots) and collects mesozooplankton in up to SO discrete samples on a roll of <b>filtering</b> <b>mesh.</b> The spatial resolution of samples is dictated by the advance interval of the <b>filtering</b> <b>mesh,</b> which, in turn, is software controlled. So, for example, if each sample provides an integrated catch over 20 km, a single deployment may cover up to 1000 km. The U-Tow can carry a range of sensor packages with data being stored either in an internal data logger or transferred in real time up a conducting cable to be logged on the towing ship. Additionally, the U-Tow has the capability to undulate and hence sample at a range of depths. Initial results from deployments in the NE Atlantic and Irish Sea are described...|$|E

This method utilizes surface fitting and projection techniques. Sharp features are preserved in the surface fitting algorithm by considering an anisotropic neighborhood of each vertex detected by the normal-weighted distance. In addition, to handle the mesh {{with a high level}} of noise, we perform a pre-filtering of surface normals prior to the neighborhood searching.

This paper discusses the reduction in energy consumption in the filtration process by using additive manufactured, geometrically optimised, conical, in-line filter supports. These are then compared with those currently fabricated by more conventional means. Based on computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations, a new filter support was designed and fabricated using Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology. The comparison was achieved by testing both types of filter supports of similar dimensions with <b>filter</b> <b>mesh</b> in a bespoke test rig at Croft Engineering Services. A 20 gauge, 900 µm <b>filter</b> <b>mesh</b> was used to test the two filter supports with flow rates between 0. 0018 m 3 /s to 0. 0062 m 3 /s.

In comparison to the conventional approach, the AM filter support was 0. 443 kPa pressure drop lower when operated in the forward flow direction and 1. 852 kPa lower in reverse flow.

40|$|Abstract Salps {{have higher}} {{filtration}} rates {{than most other}} holoplankton, and are capable of packaging and exporting primary production from surface waters. A method of kinematic analysis was employed to accurately measure salp feeding rates. The data were then used to explain how diverse body morphologies and swimming motions among species and lifecycle stages influence salp feeding performance. We selected five species, representing a range of morphologies and swimming styles, and used digitized outlines from video frames to measure body-shape change during a pulse cycle. Time-varying body volume was then calculated from the digitized salp outlines to estimate the amount of fluid passing through the <b>filtering</b> <b>mesh.</b> This non-invasive method produced higher feeding rates than other methods and revealed that body volume, pulse frequency and degree of contraction are important factors for determining volume filtered. Each species possessed a unique combination of these three characteristics that resulted in comparable filtration (range: 0. 44 - 15. 33 ml s- 1) and normalized filtration rates (range: 0. 21 – 1. 27 s- 1) across species. The convergence of different species with diverse morphologies on similar normalized filtration suggests a tendency towards a flow optimum...|$|E

In course of its fabrication a non-woven polystyrene membrane made by electro spinning was used as <b>filtering</b> <b>mesh</b> for CNT aqueous dispersion. Produced semi-product like filtering membrane with entrapped carbon nanotubes was stuck using solvent of PS on polystyrene test specimen. The electrical resistance of final laminate is sensitive to tensile strain when elongation leads to increase of macroscopic electrical resistance. Test specimens were then tested {{in the course of}} monotonic strain growth and also when loading/unloading cycles were imposed. Changes in resistance were found to be reversible, reproducible and deformation can by monitored in real time. Finally, sensitivity to strain can be quantified by means of a gauge factor, GF, which defines sensitivity of strain gauge as a relative resistance change divided by the applied strain. Measured GF for PS/CNT laminates reaches relatively high values, compared with ones of commonly used metallic strain gauges, serving for values of around 13 and applied tensile deformation in range 0. 1 - 0. 6 %. These experimental results are really promising serving for real practical application of this principle in course of polymeric based strain gauges or as an integrated PS/CNT units into polystyrene based constructions for their so called "health monitoring"...|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} plankton recorder (CPR) {{survey is}} an upper layer plankton monitoring {{program that has}} regularly collected samples, at monthly intervals, in the North Atlantic and adjacent seas since 1946. Water from approximately 6 m depth enters the CPR through a small aperture {{at the front of}} the sampler and travels down a tunnel where it passes through a silk <b>filtering</b> <b>mesh</b> of 270 µm before exiting at the back of the CPR. The plankton filtered on the silk is analyzed in sections corresponding to 10 nautical miles (approx. 3 m** 3 of seawater filtered) and the plankton microscopically identified (Richardson et al., 2006 and reference therein). In the present study we used the CPR data to investigate the current basin scale distribution of C. finmarchicus (C 5 -C 6), C. helgolandicus (C 5 -C 6), C. hyperboreus (C 5 -C 6), Pseudocalanus spp. (C 6), Oithona spp. (C 1 -C 6), total Euphausiida, total Thecosomata and the presence/absence of Cnidaria and the Phytoplankton Colour Index (PCI). The PCI, which is a visual assessment of the greenness of the silk, is used as an indicator of the distribution of total phytoplankton biomass across the Atlantic basin (Batten et al., 2003).

ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{the use of}} mesh 50 mm (2 ”) in artisanal purse seiner of the Tumbes Region in a multispecies fishery was assessed. We worked with a control purse seiner of mesh size of 38 mm (1. 5 ”) and the experimental fishing net of 50 mm (2. 0 ”) with a percentage of hanging ratio of 0. 65 and 0. 77; respectively. Operational assessment of the purse seine was observed {{that there was a}} difference between the curves of setting depth of the central body of the net (tc = 46. 670, t* = 1. 98, p = 0), the experimental net had a more setting depth. Likewise between the curves drop speed of the central body of the purse seiners, {{there was a significant difference}} (tc = 7. 790, t* = 1. 98, p = 0) due to greater weight and <b>filtering</b> <b>mesh</b> of the experimental net. The horizontal opening (μ 1) of the meshes in the upper band for the maximum setting depth and purse line recovering, the meshes of cod end, middle part and last body of the net, was on average (μ 1) 0. 71, 0. 74 and 0. 73 respectively; (values close to the hanging coefficient ideal for escaping of fusiform fishes). The average (μ 1) obtained in the region of the central meshes in the cod end, middle part and last body of the net was 0. 85, 0. 85 and 0. 84 respectively; which indicated a greater horizontal opening of the mesh above the hanging coefficient would not allow the escape of fishes.

40|$|Abstract. The {{construction}} of linear mesh layouts has found various applications, such as implicit <b>mesh</b> <b>filtering</b> and <b>mesh</b> streaming, where {{a variety of}} layout quality criteria, e. g., span and width, can be considered. While spectral sequencing, derived from the Fiedler vector, {{is one of the}} best-known heuristics for minimizing width, it does not perform as well as the Cuthill-Mckee (CM) scheme in terms of span. In this paper, we treat optimal mesh layout generation as a problem of preserving graph distances and propose to use the subdominant eigenvector of a kernel (affinity) matrix for sequencing. Despite the non-sparsity of the affinity operators we use, the layouts can be computed efficiently for large meshes through subsampling and eigenvector extrapolation. Our experiments show that the new sequences obtained outperform those derived from the Fiedler vector, in terms of spans, and those obtained from CM, in terms of widths and other important quality criteria. Therefore, in applications where several such quality criteria can influence algorithm performance simultaneously, e. g., mesh streaming and implicit <b>mesh</b> <b>filtering,</b> the new <b>mesh</b> layouts could potentially provide a better trade-off. ...|$|R

As the suspension flows through a magnetized <b>filter</b> <b>mesh,</b> high magnetic gradients around the wires attract and capture the particles removing them from the fluid. We model such a system by considering the motion of a paramagnetic tracer particle through a periodic array of magnetized cylinders. We show that there is a critical Mason number (ratio of viscous to magnetic forces) below which the particle is captured irrespective of its initial position in the array. Above this threshold, particle capture is only partially successful and depends on the particle's entry position. We determine the relationship between the critical Mason number and the system geometry using numerical and asymptotic calculations. If a capture efficiency below 100 % is sufficient, our results demonstrate how operating the HGMS system above the critical Mason number but with multiple separation cycles may increase efficiency. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R

Embedding the mesh in a 2 D Euclidian space, each vertex has two spatial coordinates and one attribute, the value of the gray level. Starting from the classical formulation of Laplacian <b>mesh</b> <b>filtering,</b> a novel objective function is introduced. The minimization of the objective function leads to new spatial coordinates for the vertices in the mesh. A reconstruction mechanism is then applied to the non-uniform mesh to reconstruct a grayscale image. Whereas the Laplacian <b>mesh</b> <b>filter</b> aims at smoothing an image, the grid smoothing tends at sharpening the edges of the image. The grid smoothing framework is applied to image enhancement in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the evolution of implicit or explicit surfaces. The first part of this thesis addresses three problems in fluid simulation: advection, thin film, and the volume error. First, we show that the back and forth error compensation and correction (BFECC) method can significantly reduce the dissipation and diffusion. Second, thin film is hard to simulate since it has highly complex liquid/gas interface that requires high memory and computational costs. We address this difficulties by using cell centered octree grid to reduce memory cost and a multigrid method to reduce computational cost. Third, the volume loss is an undesired side effect of the level set method. The known solution to this problem is the particle level set method, which is expensive and has small but accumulating volume error. We provide a solution that is computationally effective and can prevent volume loss without accumulation. The second part of this thesis is focused on <b>filtering</b> a triangle <b>mesh</b> to produce a mesh whose details are selectively reduced or amplified. We develop a <b>mesh</b> <b>filter</b> with a rational transfer function, which is a generalization from previously developed <b>mesh</b> <b>filters.</b> In addition, we show that the <b>mesh</b> <b>filter</b> parameters can be computed from the physical size of mesh feature.

40|$|Abstract. The {{construction}} of linear mesh layouts has found various applications, such as implicit <b>mesh</b> <b>filtering</b> and <b>mesh</b> streaming, where {{a variety of}} layout quality criteria, e. g., width and span, can be considered. Similar linear sequencing problems have also been studied {{in the context of}} sparse matrix reordering and graph labeling, where width and span correspond to vertex separation and bandwidth, respectively. One of the best-known heuristics for generating width-minimizing orderings is spectral sequencing, which is derived from the Fiedler vector. In terms of span however, other heuristics, such as the Cuthill-Mckee (CM) scheme, generally outperform spectral sequencing. In this paper, we study the general linear sequence generation as a problem of preserving graph distances and propose to use for sequencing the subdominant eigenvector of a kernel (affinity) matrix, defined by graph distances and appropriately chosen transfer functions. The use of Laplacians can then be seen as a special case, where a step transfer function of unit width is applied. Despite the non-sparsity of the kernel matrix we use, the sequences can be computed efficiently for problems of large size through subsampling and eigenvector extrapolation. When applied to mesh layouts generation, we show experimentally that the sequences obtained using our algorithm outperform those derived from the Fiedler vector, in terms of spans, and those obtained from CM, in terms of widths and other important quality criteria. Therefore, in applications where several such quality criteria can influence algorithm performance simultaneously, e. g., mesh streaming and implicit <b>mesh</b> <b>filtering,</b> the new <b>mesh</b> layouts could potentially provide a better trade-off. ...|$|R
