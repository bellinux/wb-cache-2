Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
500|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{story of}} how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a [...] "ginger vision"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; {{he played in the}} set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, [...] "they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it." [...] Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had [...] "just been filling in for the last fifteen years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Waldman was a shocked {{member of}} the crowd on the street that {{witnessed}} the catastrophic Triangle Waist Company fire of 1911, an event which clearly always remained with him and served {{as one of the}} landmarks of his life. Waldman described the grim scene in his 1944 memoirs: [...] One Saturday afternoon in March of that year — March 25, to be precise — <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> one of the reading tables in the old Astor Library... It was a raw, unpleasant day and the comfortable reading room seemed a delightful place to spend the remaining few hours until the library closed. I was deeply engrossed in my book when I became aware of fire engines racing past the building. By this time I was sufficiently Americanized to be fascinated by the sound of fire engines. Along with several others in the library, I ran out to see what was happening, and followed crowds of people {{to the scene of the}} fire.|$|E

6000|$|My {{wife and}} <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the open bow-window of my study, {{watching}} the tuft of bright-red leaves on our favorite maple, which warned us that summer <b>was</b> over. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> solacing myself, {{like all the}} world in our days, with reading the [...] "Schönberg Cotta Family," [...] when my wife made her voice heard through the enchanted distance, and dispersed the pretty vision of German cottage life.|$|R
60|$|One day, while Lumley and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> dinner--which {{we usually}} took about noon--we were agreeably {{surprised}} {{by the appearance of}} a strange Indian, and still more agreeably surprised by his entering the hall and holding out a packet to Lumley. Having delivered it, the man, who looked wayworn, strode to the fire, sat quietly down and began to smoke a pipe which I had handed to him ready charged.|$|R

[...] "My wife and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the table, thinking of a way to thank Paul, and I suggested becoming a vegetarian. As our son is already a vegetarian, all it required was jumping onto the same boat. When I met Paul at one of his gigs in Berlin, I told him and he was visibly flabbergasted. Three days later the FedEx man delivered three Linda McCartney cookbooks." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> {{the piano}} one afternoon, singing that {{stirring}} refrain, so justly celebrated, but which a craven spirit, unworthy of England, has excluded {{from some of}} her principal restaurants, and was dwelling with some enthusiasm on the following line:-- ...|$|E

6000|$|Dinner was over, and my godmother and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> {{the table}} before the fire. The clock ticked, the fire clicked; not another sound had been heard in the room or {{in the house for}} I don't know how long.

6000|$|Here <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> my window, {{overlooking}} Lake Leman. Castle Chillon, {{with its}} old conical towers, is silently pictured {{in the still}} waters. It has been a day of a thousand. We took a boat, with two oarsmen, and passed leisurely along the shores, under the cool, drooping branches of trees, to the castle, which is scarce a stone's throw from the hotel. We rowed along, close under the walls, to the ancient moat and drawbridge. There I picked a bunch of blue bells, [...] "les clochettes," [...] which were hanging their aerial pendants from every crevice--some blue, some white.|$|R

60|$|His {{great blue}} eyes flashed at her fiercely. With one turn {{of his hand}} he brought his chair close at her side.

60|$|He was very, very, {{very fond}} of Ada. I mean it, and I had better say it at once. I had never seen any young people falling in love before, but I found them out quite soon. I could not say so, of course, or show that I knew {{anything}} about it. On the contrary, I was so demure and used to seem so unconscious that sometimes I considered within myself while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> work whether I was not growing quite deceitful.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> my desk in London when a {{telegram}} came announcing {{that my mother}} was again dangerously ill, and I seized my hat and hurried to the station. It is not a memory of one night only. A score of times, I am sure, I was called north thus suddenly, and reached our little town trembling, head out at railway-carriage window for a glance at a known face which would answer the question on mine. These illnesses came as regularly as the backend of the year, but were less regular in going, and through them all, by night and by day, I see my sister moving so unwearyingly, so lovingly, though with failing strength, that I bow my head in reverence for her. She was wearing herself done. The doctor advised us to engage a nurse, but the mere word frightened my mother, and we got between her and the door as if the woman was already on the stair. To have a strange woman in my mother’s room—you who are used to them cannot conceive what it meant to us.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} first {{recorded}} in Atlantic Studios in New York and was continued in IBC Studios, London.Barry {{said in the}} booklet with Tales from the Brothers Gibb that {{the title of the}} song came from the birthday of his dog, Barnaby.

[...] "Barry and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the piano", he said, [...] "And I started playing the chords, and Barry started singing, 'When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> small and Christmas trees were tall' and started singing along with it. We put a demo down with a vocal and we kept the piano track. Went back to England, and went into IBC Studios in London, added onto that piano track and Barry's vocal stayed on as well. We had a choir and an orchestra all on this one piano". This song was initially taped in demo form in New York City on 16 August 1968.|$|R

60|$|Let your lordship {{conceive}} of your poor officer, once lieutenant and Rittmaster under that invincible monarch, the bulwark of the Protestant faith, Gustavus the Victorious; conceive, I say, Dugald Dalgetty, of Drumthwacket that should be, in Paris, concerned with {{a matter of}} weight and moment not necessary to be mooted or minted of. As <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> my tavern ordinary, for I consider that an experienced cavalier should ever lay in provenant as occasion serveth, comes in to me a stipendiary of my Lord Winter, bidding me know that his master would speak to me: and that not coram populo, as I doubt not your lordship said at St. Leonard's College in St. Andrews, but privily. Thereon I rise and wait on him; to be brief- -brevis esse laboro, as we said lang syne--his lordship would have me to be of his backers in private rencontre with four gentlemen of the King's Musketeers.|$|R
60|$|I {{was in a}} job in '94 {{where we}} got twenty {{thousand}} dollars. We followed our favourite plan for a get-away--that is, doubled on our trail--and laid low for a time near {{the scene of the}} train's bad luck. One morning I picked up a newspaper and read an article with big headlines stating that the marshal, with eight deputies and a posse of thirty armed citizens, had the train robbers surrounded in a mesquite thicket on the Cimarron, and that {{it was a question of}} only a few hours when they would be dead men or prisoners. While I was reading that article <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> breakfast in one of the most elegant private residences in Washington City, with a flunky in knee pants standing behind my chair. Jim was sitting across the table talking to his half-uncle, a retired naval officer, whose name you have often seen in the accounts of doings in the capital. We had gone there and bought rattling outfits of good clothes, and were resting from our labours among the nabobs. We must have been killed in that mesquite thicket, for I can make an affidavit that we didn't surrender.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> {{the window}} with my {{guardian}} on the following morning, and Ada was busy writing--of course to Richard--when Miss Jellyby was announced, and entered, leading the identical Peepy, whom she had made some endeavours to render presentable by wiping the dirt into corners {{of his face and}} hands and making his hair very wet and then violently frizzling it with her fingers. Everything the dear child wore was either too large for him or too small. Among his other contradictory decorations he had the hat of a bishop and the little gloves of a baby. His boots were, on a small scale, the boots of a ploughman, while his legs, so crossed and recrossed with scratches that they looked like maps, were bare below a very short pair of plaid drawers finished off with two frills of perfectly different patterns. The deficient buttons on his plaid frock had evidently been supplied from one of Mr. Jellyby's coats, they were so extremely brazen and so much too large. Most extraordinary specimens of needlework appeared on several parts of his dress, where it had been hastily mended, and I recognized the same hand on Miss Jellyby's. She was, however, unaccountably improved in her appearance and looked very pretty. She was conscious of poor little Peepy being but a failure after all her trouble, and she showed it as she came in by the way in which she glanced first at him and then at us.|$|E
6000|$|This {{state of}} things lasted from May {{to the middle}} of June; then, one very hot, still day, about three o'clock, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> my cottage window when I caught the sound of a {{rumbling}} cart and a man singing. As the noise grew louder my interest in the approaching man and cart was excited to an extraordinary degree; never had I heard such a noise! And no wonder, since the man was driving a heavy, springless farm cart in the most reckless manner, urging his two huge horses to a fast trot, then a gallop, up and down hill along those rough gully-like roads, he standing up in his cart and roaring out [...] "Auld Lang Syne," [...] {{at the top of a}} voice of tremendous power. He was probably tipsy, but it was not a bad voice, and the old familiar tune and words had an extraordinary effect in that still atmosphere. He passed my cottage, standing up, his legs wide apart, his cap on the back of his head, a big broad-chested young man, lashing his horses, and then for about two minutes or longer the thunder of the cart and the roaring song came back fainter, until it faded away in the distance. At that still hour of the day the children were all at school on the further side of the village; the men away in the fields; the women shut up in their cottages, perhaps sleeping. It seemed to me that I was the only person in the village who had witnessed and heard the passing of the big-voiced man and cart. But it was not so. At all events, next day, the whole village, men, women and children, were singing, humming and whistling [...] "Auld Lang Syne," [...] and [...] "Auld Lang Syne" [...] lasted for several days, and from that day [...] "Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay" [...] was heard no more. It had lost its charm.|$|E
6000|$|Yet no {{one asked}} for their secret. Dumb [...] It lay in their big eyes' heavy hollows.

60|$|It {{may have}} been an hour or so past noon when, at last, my {{solitude}} was invaded by a soldier who came to order me into the presence of the Governor. <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the window, leaning against the bars and looking out at the desolate white landscape, for there had been a heavy fall of snow in the night, which reminded me--as snow ever did--of my first meeting with Madonna Paola.|$|R
