6000|$|... "Easy," [...] commented Billy, relieved. [...] "Get {{ready to}} beat it when <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> I got a pony south o' town that'll {{have to carry}} double for a little way tonight." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to Catriona {{and stopped}} {{her on the}} threshold.|$|R
60|$|My mother spoke over <b>the</b> banisters, and <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and let in McPherson.|$|R
60|$|WHEN I {{arrived at}} my rooms, my {{colleague}} hurried {{to meet me}} <b>the</b> moment <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bless my soul!' thought Tom at last. 'Perhaps {{he lives}} here, and is calling to me. I {{never thought of}} that. Can <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> from the outside, I wonder. Yes, to be sure I can.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hah! I am of a fair size, {{but could}} not have the honour of {{presenting}} myself in that room without a ladder. Now, madam, frankly--frankness {{is a part of}} my character--shall <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Depend upon me," [...] Arsenio {{answered}} him. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of your tower I shall whistle to you. The key of the postern {{hangs on}} the guardroom wall. I shall possess myself of that before I come." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{must try}} also. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Pouf! It shut with a bang. We all exclaimed with joy.|$|R
60|$|She nodded, and I led <b>the</b> way upstairs. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and closed}} it again softly, leaving them alone....|$|R
60|$|Kate {{was alone}} when I entered. She looked up quickly as <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{and turned away}} {{disappointed}} when she recognized me.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "we won't {{have any}} of this. If she comes in she must see you--and think if she likes there's {{something}} wrong! But how can <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to her, when she dislikes me--wishes to see not me, but her son? I won't open the door!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Man!" [...] sternly replied Ethan Brand, [...] "what need have I of the Devil? I {{have left}} him behind me, on my track. It is with such half-way sinners as {{you that he}} busies himself. Fear not, because <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> I do but act by old custom, and am going to trim your fire, like a lime-burner, as I was once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may pierce our walls," [...] Walter replied, [...] "but it {{will cost}} you many lives before you force your way in; we will defend the hold from floor to floor, {{and you know how}} desperate men can fight. It will cost you scores of lives before you win your way to the summit of this keep; but if I have your knightly word that the lives of all within these walls shall be spared, then will <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and lay down our arms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardieu!" [...] quoth <b>I,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> [...] "it seems, Lieutenant, that I {{must have}} fallen asleep over those musty documents." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} the boarder was yelling and {{pounding}} at <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> When Euphemia was ready <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and took her out.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} no second opportunity, Miss Gracedieu, of {{insulting}} me." [...] With that foolish reply, <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> violently and went out.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is well," [...] he said, {{looking at}} it approvingly. [...] "I myself, {{although}} I know that, until my time has come, no creature can harm me, cannot resist a shudder when I hear one rustling amid the leaves of my bed; for they come in, although {{some of my friends}} have had a door placed to exclude their entry at night. I wander but little from my cell, and always close the door after me; but they enter, sometimes, when I am meditating, and forgetful of earthly matters, and the first I know of their presence is the rustling of the leaves in the bed, at night. Were I as strong in faith as I should be, I would heed it not. I tell myself so; but my fear is stronger than my will, and I am forced to rise, turn up the leaves with a stick until I find them, and then <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and eject them, with as much gentleness as may be." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{heard the}} {{rustling}} of leaves behind. A youth was following her along the path, some ravening youth, whose ungoverned breathing {{had a kind}} of pathos in it. Heaven! What irony! She was too miserable to care, hardly even knew when, in the main path again, she was free from his pursuit. Love! Why had it such possession of her, that a little thing--yes, a little thing--only the sight of him with another, should make her suffer so? She came out {{on the other side of}} the park. What should she do? Crawl home, creep into her hole, and lie there stricken! At Paddington she found a train just starting and got in. There were other people in the carriage, business men from the city, lawyers, from that--place where she had been. And she was glad of their company, glad of the crackle of evening papers and stolid faces giving her looks of stolid interest from behind them, glad to have to keep her mask on, afraid of the violence of her emotion. But one by one they got out, to their cars or their constitutionals, and she was left alone to gaze at darkness and the deserted river just visible in the light of a moon smothered behind the sou'westerly sky. And for one wild moment she thought: 'Shall <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and step out--one step--peace!' ...|$|E
6000|$|He had had {{his coffee}} served {{to him on the}} bench, as his {{frequent}} custom was, but it stood untasted in the little copper pot beside the dismounted cannon, though it was now ten o'clock, and it was full time he had breakfasted, for he had risen early to perform the matin service for three peasant women, two beggars, a cat, and a paralytic nobleman, in the ancient and beautiful church to which he was attached. He had tried to go about his wonted occupations, but he was still sitting idle before his bench, while his servant gossiped from her balcony to the mistress of the next house, across a calle so deep and narrow that it opened like a mountain chasm beneath them. [...] "It were well if the master read his breviary a little more, instead of always maddening himself with those blessed inventions, that eat more soldi than a Christian, and never come to anything. There he sits before his table, as if he were nailed to his chair, and lets his coffee cool--and God knows I was ready to drink it warm two hours ago--and never looks at me if <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> twenty times to see whether he has finished. Holy patience! You have not even the advantage of fasting to the glory of God in this house, though you keep Lent the year round. It's the Devil's Lent, I say. Eh, Diana! There goes the bell. Who now? Adieu, Lusetta. To meet again, dear. Farewell!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for him, and, {{taking up}} his brick again, he entered, and I {{followed}} him in. There was a deal of talk.|$|R
60|$|Grieved that I had unintentionally roused her fear, <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and called}} Dumps. My doggie rose, with his three {{indicators}} erect and expectant.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and as Ganymede obediently {{slipped past}} me and {{vanished}} down the passage [...] "Monsieur l'Hote," [...] I called. [...] "Ho, there, Gilles!" ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{stand at}} the street corner, I don't see {{as many as four}} people at once going to church, though I see as many as four churches with their {{steeples}} clamouring for people. I choose my church, and go up the flight of steps to the great entrance in the tower. A mouldy tower within, and like a neglected washhouse. A rope comes through the beamed roof, and a man in the corner pulls it and clashes the bell--a whity-brown man, whose clothes were once black- -a man with flue on him, and cobweb. He stares at me, wondering how I come there, and I stare at him, wondering how he comes there. Through a screen of wood and glass, I peep into the dim church. About twenty people are discernible, waiting to begin. Christening would seem to have faded out of this church long ago, for the font has the dust of desuetude thick upon it, and its wooden cover (shaped like an old-fashioned tureen-cover) looks as if it wouldn't come off, upon requirement. I perceive the altar to be rickety and the Commandments damp. Entering after this survey, I jostle the clergyman in his canonicals, who is entering too from a dark lane behind a pew of state with curtains, where nobody sits. The pew is ornamented with four blue wands, once carried by four somebodys, I suppose, before somebody else, but which there is nobody now to hold or receive honour from. <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of a family pew, and shut myself in; if I could occupy twenty family pews at once I might have them. The clerk, a brisk young man (how does HE come here?), glances at me knowingly, as who should say, 'You have done it now; you must stop.' Organ plays. Organ-loft is in a small gallery across the church; gallery congregation, two girls. I wonder within myself what will happen when we are required to sing.|$|E
5000|$|Lord Jesus, I need You. Thank You for {{dying on}} the cross for my sins. <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{of my life and}} receive You as my Savior and Lord. Thank You for {{forgiving}} my sins and giving me eternal life. Take control of the throne of my life. Make me the kind of person You want me to be.|$|E

60|$|The hostess was all ears, {{struck by}} the respectful manner in which this very evidently noble lady {{addressed}} a Fool. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for her.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and a {{storm of}} sleet and spray stung our faces. Old Pegg, who had been there to sell and collect tickets, shouted to us.|$|R

5000|$|As {{part of his}} {{association}} with BBC NOW, Puw was commissioned by the BBC to compose for the 2007 Proms. His orchestral piece, [...] ("... unless <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> ...") was premiered on 9 August 2007, conducted by David Atherton. It {{is based on a}} story from the Mabinogion, a collection of medieval Welsh tales, in which a group of warriors, lately returned from Ireland, feast in Harlech for seven years with the severed head of their leader {{at the head of the}} table. They then feast in Penfro for eighty years in a hall with three doors, and only remember the dreadful events that happened in Ireland when the third door opens. Each of the three doors in Penfro was represented by an instrument in a box in the Royal Albert Hall.|$|E
5000|$|... "At about 9:30 {{there was}} a knock at the door, too gentle a tapping to signal the {{presence}} of the police. Yair…went into the closet, and only then did <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> At the door stood the 'good' detective Wilkins with two men behind him. Wilkins was always very polite, too polite perhaps. He asked me why I hadn't gone to visit my husband Moshe and if I weren't worried about him. I told him that if I had gone to the hospital I would have been arrested immediately. They searched my room…then they went downstairs and brought two neighbors, women, so they might have witnesses…they went over to the closet…one of the policemen opened it. Yair was nowhere to be seen. The policemen thrust his left hand into the closet and began searching, and when his hand came upon Yair he pulled him out. At the same time he put his right hand into his back pocket and took out his gun. I ran between him and Yair and said [...] "Don't shoot! If you shoot, you shoot me"…. in my innocence I thought I had saved Yair's life…how wrong I was. They made him sit on the sofa…more detectives appeared, they had handcuffs and used them to bind Yair's hands behind his back….they told me to get dressed and go downstairs…I got into a small car…suddenly I heard three shots." ...|$|E
5000|$|While Salinas {{sold his}} work steadily, by 1960 {{he was known}} {{primarily}} to Texas collectors and tourists who visited San Antonio. In 1961, this changed rapidly {{with the election of}} his collector Lyndon B. Johnson (1908-1973) to the Vice Presidency of the United States. With his ascension from the United States Senate to being Vice President, Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson (1912-2007) purchased a large French-style chateau from the socialite and heiress Perle Mesta (1889-1975). They decorated the house with French antiques and tapestries that were already in the home, but the foyer was hung with Texas wildflower paintings by Salinas. Lady Bird Johnson was quoted as saying, [...] "I want to see them when <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> to remind me of where I come from." [...] Lyndon Johnson told the Washington press that Porfirio Salinas was [...] "his favorite artist." [...] President Johnson also presented a Salinas painting to President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz of Mexico as an official gift from the United States. The patronage of the President was a tremendous boost to the artist's career and during the 1960s, his work sold briskly for ever higher prices. The Johnsons' Salinas paintings remain {{in the collection of the}} LBJ Ranch today. President and Lady Bird Johnson were both advocates and admirers of wildflowers. Lady Bird Johnson will always remain linked to the subject of wildflowers because of her [...] "Beautify America" [...] campaign and the Highway Beautification Act, which was passed by the United States Congress in 1965. As part of that effort, many miles of Texas roadsides were seeded with Texas bluebonnets, Lupinus texensis, the flowers that Salinas is known for painting.|$|E
60|$|He {{was still}} writing. The {{air of the}} room was thick with {{cigarette}} smoke. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> gently, and Lady Dennisford glided past me. I myself hastened downstairs.|$|R
60|$|I {{had not yet}} sat down, and I {{went first}} to see who it was. When <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> Madame Fosco confronted me with my {{handkerchief}} in her hand.|$|R
60|$|No answer. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{and went}} in. The room was empty. What's more, the bunk hadn't been slept in. I don't know when I've been more surprised. I went on deck.|$|R
