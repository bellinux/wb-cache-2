5|$|Evans {{returned}} to the custom in his 1804 work Letters Written During a Tour Through South Wales, in the year 1803, and at Other Times. <b>Here</b> <b>he</b> provided a clearer discussion than before, making it apparent that teams accompanying a man dressed as a horse or bull toured the local area from Christmas until after Twelfth Day, {{and that they were}} given food or money to leave the householders alone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Here</b> <b>he</b> {{met some}} of his lifelong friends and colleagues: Martin Tranmæl, Oscar Torp and Einar Gerhardsen.

5|$|Next Stace {{explains}} {{that there are}} two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination.
