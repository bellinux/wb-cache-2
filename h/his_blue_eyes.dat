500|$|The man is {{positioned}} within an undefined narrow space and {{set against a}} flat black background. Typically for vanEyck, the head is large {{in relation to the}} torso. He is dressed in typically Burgundian fashion, with a red robe and a green wool chaperon with a bourrelet and cornette hanging forward. The headdress is trimmed with fur, fastened with two buttons, and extends to the parapet. His right hand might be holding the end of the cornette. Neither the shape of his head nor his facial features correspond to contemporary standard types, let alone canons of ideal beauty. The sitter appears to be bald, although there are some faint traces of fair hair, leading Erwin Panofsky to conclude that his [...] "countenance is as 'Nordic' as his dress is Burgundian." [...] Though he has neither eyebrows nor stubble, he does have eyelashes that are believed to have been added by a 19th-century restorer. Van Eyck's cool observation of the man's narrow shoulders, pursed lips, and thin eyebrows extends to detailing the moisture on <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
2500|$|More recent {{artistic and}} {{cinematic}} portrayals {{have also made}} an effort to characterize Jesus as an ancient Middle Eastern resident. In the 2004 movie, The Passion of the Christ, Jesus was portrayed by Jim Caviezel who wore a prosthetic nose during filming and had <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> digitally changed to brown to give him a more Middle Eastern appearance. According to designer Miles Teves, who created the prosthesis: [...] "Mel (Gibson) wanted to make the actor playing Jesus, James Caviezel, look more ethnically Middle Eastern, and it was decided that we could do it best by changing the shape of his nose." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Go to the County Ground on any {{day in the}} cricket season – or, {{for that}} matter, on a good many days outside it – and somewhere between the indoor school and the {{pavilion}} {{you are likely to}} meet a comfortable, well-fed-looking man going in one direction when he obviously wants to go in several. He has a rosy face, a quizzical look in <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> and one eyebrow goes up as he asks you wistfully, {{out of the side of}} his mouth, [...] "ave you seen so-and-so?" [...] This is 'The Coach'. Arthur Holt finds that title convenient: it saves him the embarrassment of telling ground staff boys that they must call him Mister Holt and not Arthur." ...|$|E
50|$|Much of the V2's {{internal}} {{behavior can}} be deduced by the blinking patterns of <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye</b> pads, which change as the V2 changes modes.|$|R
60|$|Jack {{never made}} a joke, but, certes, he could enjoy one; {{and he had a}} way of showing his {{enjoyment}} by a twinkle in <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye</b> and a chuckle in his throat that was peculiarly impressive.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not compelled, chief," [...] cried Bladud, with a {{look and}} a flash in <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye</b> which presaged a sudden rupture of {{friendly}} relations. [...] "We can each go our own way and hunt on our own account." ...|$|R
60|$|Tod {{nodded and}} <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> staring above the children's heads, darkened.|$|E

6000|$|... "Has it not {{occurred}} to you, dear," [...] said her mother, pursuing her advantage in a meditative tone, [...] "that if Miles {{has been so}} plain-spoken and eloquent with <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eye,</b> that your pretty brown ones may have said something to him?" ...|$|R

60|$|He {{looked at}} Gerald, and saw how <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> were {{lit up with}} a little flame of curious desire. He saw too how good-looking he was. Gerald was attractive, his blood seemed fluid and electric. <b>His</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> burned with a keen, yet cold light, {{there was a certain}} beauty, a {{beautiful}} passivity in all his body, his moulding.|$|E
60|$|Wulf {{looked at}} him, and a curious flash of {{inspiration}} shone in <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|The visitor's {{expression}} {{remained unchanged}} {{except for the}} faint surprise which shone out of <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

60|$|Saxon was {{glowing with}} appreciation, but Mrs. Mortimer, glancing at Billy, noted not entire approval. <b>His</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> were clouded.|$|E
60|$|The others stood bewildered. What {{did he mean}} to do? He {{turned to}} Hans and <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> shone like steel.|$|E

60|$|<b>His</b> round <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> {{behind the}} {{spectacles}} were ghastly with terror. The magnifying-glasses he wore distorted them.|$|R
60|$|Syme turned <b>his</b> bright <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> on Bull with an earnestness {{which he}} did not {{commonly}} make clear.|$|R

60|$|He was {{now where}} Lime could see him, glaring up into <b>his</b> smiling <b>blue</b> <b>eyes.</b> Lime stood <b>his</b> ground.|$|R
