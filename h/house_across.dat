5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Gerald Ford {{moves into}} the <b>house</b> <b>across</b> the street after Bush leaves. When {{originally}} conceived, Richard Nixon was going to move in instead, though this was changed to Bob Dole following Nixon's death. The writers then decided it would be funnier if it were Ford since they believed he was the politician who best represented Homer. Keeler's first draft also included a musical number in the style of Tom Lehrer's satirical recordings, although this ended up being cut.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, the building's {{exterior}} {{became increasingly}} dilapidated; among those {{concerned about the}} church's deterioration was Russian bard Vladimir Vysotsky, {{who lived in a}} <b>house</b> <b>across</b> the street. In the late 1970s the city considered renovating the building, possibly to use as a concert hall for organ recitals, or as a general cultural administration centre. These projects were never carried out due to resistance from the research institute.|$|E
5|$|Evergreen Terrace {{is holding}} a street-wide rummage sale in Springfield.

Bush and his wife Barbara. Bart decides to visit, and Barbara takes a liking to him, but his overall rebellious attitude annoys George. Eventually, after he accidentally shreds George's memoirs, the former President spanks Bart. An outraged Homer confronts George and both men vow to make trouble for each other.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, the Intercultural Center, a {{multicultural}} student space, moved into Lathrop {{in spite of}} initial disagreement {{by members of the}} house two years earlier when the idea was first proposed. The Intercultural Center later moved out of Lathrop's basement and into its own dedicated space in the early 1990s, at which point it was replaced by a Jewish co-op and kitchen. In 1995, the Kosher Co-Op moved out of Lathrop and into a newly acquired Jewish <b>house</b> <b>across</b> the street from the college.|$|E
5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. The {{plan was to}} rent a <b>house</b> <b>across</b> {{the street from the}} prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from the house to the prison. Berkman had been given access to {{a large portion of the}} prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the house to the stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to her limitations {{with the human}} form, MacDonald points out that Potter's mastery in the depiction of rabbits attains full flower in The Flopsy Bunnies. Potter conveys the rabbits' thoughts and emotions with {{the position of the}} tail or the ear. Benjamin, Peter, his mother, and Flopsy all wear clothes, but Flopsy wears only an apron that exposes her tail and is thus incompletely clothed in comparison to her family and by human standards. But this incompleteness in dress permits her tail to be exposed and to precisely convey her apprehension as she approaches the <b>house</b> <b>across</b> the vast expanse of the lawn in search of her babies.|$|E

He received {{his first job}} from John Downing of Downing McPeak Vision Centers, which brought him to Bowling Green after {{completing his}} residency. Paul worked for Downing {{for about five years}} before parting ways. Afterwards, he went to work at the Graves Gilbert Clinic, a private medical group in Bowling Green, for 10years before creating his own practice in a converted one-story <b>house</b> <b>across</b> the street from Downing's office. After his election to the U.S. Senate, he merged his practice with Downing's medical practice. Paul has faced two malpractice lawsuits between 1993 and 2010; he was cleared in one case while the other was settled for $50,000.

Paul won the Melvin Jones Fellow Award for Dedicated Humanitarian Services from the Lions Club International Foundation for his work establishing the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic.|$|E
5|$|Conwell {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on December 2, 1820. The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy that preceded Conwell's arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, William Hogan, {{approached}} de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia. After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan {{was assigned to}} St. Mary's Church. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy. Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already {{moved out of the}} priests' residence at Old St. Joseph's Church to a <b>house</b> <b>across</b> the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.|$|E
