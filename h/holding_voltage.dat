50|$|Snapback is {{initiated}} {{by a small}} current from collector to base. In the case of ESD protection devices, this current is caused by avalanche breakdown due to a sufficiently large voltage applied across the collector-base junction. In the case of parasitic failures, the initiating current may result from inadvertently turning on the bipolar transistor and a sufficiently large voltage across the collector and base causing impact ionization, {{with some of the}} generated carriers then acting as the initiating current as they flow into the base. Once this initiating current flows into the base, the transistor turns on and the collector voltage decreases to the snapback <b>holding</b> <b>voltage.</b> This voltage happens {{at the point where the}} processes of base current generation and the bipolar transistor turning on are in balance: the collector-emitter current of the bipolar transistor decreases the collector voltage, which results in a lower electric field, which results in a smaller impact ionization or avalanche current and thus smaller base current, which weakens the bipolar action.|$|E
5000|$|The {{voltage clamp}} is a current generator. Transmembrane voltage is {{recorded}} through a [...] "voltage electrode", relative to ground, and a [...] "current electrode" [...] passes current into the cell.

The electrodes are connected to an amplifier, which measures membrane potential and feeds the signal into a feedback amplifier. This amplifier also gets an input from the signal generator that determines the command potential, and it subtracts the membrane potential from the command potential (Vcommand - Vm), magnifies any difference, and sends an output to the current electrode. Whenever the cell deviates from the <b>holding</b> <b>voltage,</b> the operational amplifier generates an [...] "error signal", that {{is the difference between}} the command potential and the actual voltage of the cell. The feedback circuit passes current into the cell to reduce the error signal to zero. Thus, the clamp circuit produces a current equal and opposite to the ionic current.|$|E
