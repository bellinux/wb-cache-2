The analysis of the corpus of 4000 items has shown that word <b>end</b> <b>reduction</b> is greater after a circumflex accent. The drawn-out nature of the circumflex accent in the Northern Žemaitian dialect causes the concentration of the main energy on the distinctly drawn-out sound, weakening the intensity of the ending and as a result reducing it more. The vowel heard more distinctly after the acute accent, which in the dialect is most often realised as a broken one, apparently is determined {{by the nature of the}} broken accent it­self: when the break is very distinct, the final vowel following it becomes more distinct as well.

30|$|The elucidation of FcRn biology {{prompted}} active {{efforts by}} the biopharmaceutical industry to create therapeutic mAbs with super long half-lives through Fc engineering. The amino acids in the Fc region have been thoroughly investigated to identify mutations that significantly enhance binding to FcRn at pH 6 while maintaining little or no binding at neutral pH (7.4). It {{has been reported that}} specific Fc variants (T 250 Q/M 428 L, V 308 P, M 428 L, M 252 Y/S 254 T/T 256 E, M 428 L/N 434 S, N 434 A, N 434 H) that improve IgG affinity for FcRn at pH 6 with little or no binding to FcRn at neutral pH can lead to 2 – 4 -fold longer terminal half-lives in cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys (Yeung et al., 2009, 2010; Vaccaro et al., 2005; Olafsen, 2012; Hinton et al., 2004, 2006; Deng et al., 2010; Datta-Mannan et al., 2007 a, b, 2012 a, b). This general relationship has also been validated more recently in humans with the M 252 Y/S 254 T/T 256 E (YTE) set of mutations constructed on the Fc of a mAb against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with half-life increases from around 20  days to more than 60  days (Robbie et al., 2013). However, a good quantitative relationship between in vitro FcRn binding affinity and in vivo half-life has not been well-established (Datta-Mannan & Wroblewski, 2014), suggesting that factors other than FcRn interaction also play an important role. On the opposite <b>end,</b> <b>reduction</b> of IgG half-life can be realized for in vivo diagnostic and research purposes by engineering poor binders of FcRn (Swiercz et al., 2014; Olafsen et al., 2006).

40|$|The FhuA protein of Escherichia coli K- 12 {{transports}} ferrichrome, {{the antibiotic}} albomycin, colicin M, and microcin 25 across the outer membrane {{and serves as}} a receptor for the phages T 1, T 5, φ 80, and UC- 1. FhuA is activated by the electrochemical potential of the cytoplasmic membrane, which probably opens a channel in FhuA. It is thought that the proteins TonB, ExbB, and ExbD function as a coupling device between the cytoplasmic membrane and the outer membrane. Excision of 34 residues from FhuA, tentatively designated the gating loop, converts FhuA into a permanently open channel. FhuA contains two disulfide bridges, one in the gating loop and one close to the C-terminal <b>end.</b> <b>Reduction</b> of the disulfide bridges results in a low in vivo reaction of the cysteines in the gating loop and no reaction of the C-terminal cysteines with biotin-maleimide, as determined by streptavidin-β-galactosidase bound to biotin. In this study we show that a cysteine residue introduced into the gating loop by replacement of Asp- 336 displayed a rather high reactivity and was used to monitor structural changes in FhuA upon binding of ferrichrome. Flow cytometric analysis revealed fluorescence quenching by ferrichrome and albomycin of fluorescein-maleimide bound to FhuA. Ferrichrome did not inhibit Cys- 336 labeling. In contrast, labeling of Cys- 347, obtained by replacing Val- 347 in the gating loop, was inhibited by ferrichrome, but ferrichrome quenching was negligible. It is concluded that binding of ferrichrome causes a conformational change of the gating loop and that Cys- 347 is part of or close to the ferrichrome binding site. Fluorescence quenching was independent of the TonB activity. The newly introduced cysteines and the replacement of the existing cysteines by serine did not alter sensitivity of cells to the FhuA ligands tested (T 5, φ 80, T 1, colicin M, and albomycin) and fully supported growth on ferrichrome as the sole iron source. Since cells of E. coli K- 12 display no reactivity to thiol reagents, newly introduced cysteines can be used to determine surface-exposed regions of outer membrane proteins and to monitor conformational changes during their function...|$|E
