A circus agent saw him busking and hired him for three years. He later trained for three years as an actor at the Drama Centre London. Brosnan has described the feeling of becoming an actor and the impact it had on his life: [...] "When I found acting, or when acting <b>found</b> <b>me,</b> it was a liberation. It was a stepping stone into another life, away from a life that I had, and acting was something I was good at, something which was appreciated. That was a great satisfaction in my life." ...|$|E

500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who <b>found</b> <b>me...</b> told me that I was in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E
500|$|The opening track, [...] "Heart Attack", is a {{rock and}} roll/soul song that {{incorporates}} driving bass, reverberating rhythm guitar, and a four-on-the-floor drum beat. It is an homage to one of Saadiq's musical idols, Sly Stone, and was inspired by Sly and the Family Stone songs [...] "M'Lady" [...] and [...] "Dance to the Music", whose burbling background vocals are referenced in [...] "Heart Attack". Saadiq {{said he wanted to}} open Stone Rollin [...] "with that sense of urgency, that global soul and rock & roll feel". On [...] "Go to Hell", he alludes to his adopted surname with the line [...] "I'm going to be a warrior of everything I say"; [...] "Saadiq" [...] means [...] "man of his word" [...] in Arabic. He played a rockabilly style of guitar on [...] "Radio", which portrays a disapproving woman as the personification of mainstream radio: [...] "I met this girl named Radio / said her signal was low / she wasn't getting my sound". According to Saadiq, the line [...] "I tried to move away / she <b>found</b> <b>me</b> the very next day" [...] alludes to his affinity for his musical roots and those of rock and roll. The album's title track was written as an ode to curvaceous, full-figured women, backed by a sound Saadiq described as [...] "dirty, more of like a Chicago Blues, Rolling Stones dirty record ... the bluesiest joint" [...] on the album.|$|E

2500|$|Snow Patrol's frontman, Gary Lightbody, {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} writing [...] "Run" [...] in 2000.

He described: [...] "I was on a massive bender and one night I was drinking in the bar of the Glasgow School of Art. I fell down a full flight of stairs. Jonny Quinn <b>found</b> <b>me</b> in the stairwell with blood {{coming out of my}} head ... I split my head open and my eye was closed and I lost a few teeth ... I wrote Run soon after on this little guitar I'd tried to smash up in my shitty little room near Hillhead. The words 'Light up, light up' gave me this sense of a beacon." [...] In an interview with Daily Mail in 2009, Lightbody added: [...] "We had nothing. I was in a flat in Glasgow. No doubt it was raining. The song was me writing about an imagined world, projecting myself into better times." [...] Beside Lightbody, it was written by Quinn, Nathan Connolly, Mark McClelland and Iain Archer.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was curious}} why a {{high-ranking}} official in President Bill Clinton's National Security Council (NSC) was given this assignment. Wilson {{had become a}} vocal opponent of President Bush's policies in Iraq after contributing to Al Gore {{in the last election}} cycle and John Kerry in this one. During a long conversation with a senior administration official, I asked why Wilson was assigned the mission to Niger. He said Wilson had been sent by the CIA's counter-proliferation section at the suggestion of one of its employees, his wife. It was an offhand revelation from this official, who is no partisan gunslinger. When I called another official for confirmation, he said: [...] "Oh, you know about it." [...] The published report that somebody in the White House failed to plant this story with six reporters and finally <b>found</b> <b>me</b> as a willing pawn is simply untrue. At the CIA, the official designated to talk to me denied that Wilson's wife had inspired his selection but said she was delegated to request his help. He asked me not to use her name, saying she probably never again will be given a foreign assignment but that exposure of her name might cause [...] "difficulties" [...] if she travels abroad. He never suggested to me that Wilson's wife or anybody else would be endangered. If he had, I would not have used her name. I used it in the sixth paragraph of my column because it looked like the missing explanation of an otherwise incredible choice by the CIA for its mission.|$|E
