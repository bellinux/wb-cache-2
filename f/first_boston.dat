5|$|John P. Costas, {{a former}} bond trader and co-head of Fixed income at Credit Suisse <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> {{and head of}} Fixed Income Trading at Union Bank of Switzerland in 1998, was {{appointed}} CEO of UBS's investment banking division, which originated in SBC's Warburg Dillon Read division and was renamed UBS Warburg in December 2001. In an attempt {{to break into the}} elite bulge bracket of investment banks, in which UBS then had little success while rival Credit Suisse was establishing itself as a major player on Wall Street with the acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 2000, Costas shifted the growth strategy from acquiring entire firms to hiring individual investment bankers or teams of bankers from rival firms. Costas had followed a similar approach in building out the UBS fixed income business, hiring over 500 sales and trading personnel and increasing revenues from US$300million in 1998 to over US$3billion by 2001.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} possession, Boston College needed only seven plays and just under {{three minutes to}} travel 74yards. The drive culminated in a 14-yard quarterback {{scramble}} for a touchdown. Duane Brown, who had blocked the <b>first</b> <b>Boston</b> College field goal attempt, again charged through the Boston College offensive line and blocked the extra point attempt. This time, the ball bounced {{into the hands of}} Virginia Tech's Brandon Flowers, who returned it 75yards for a defensive two-point conversion. The play kept Boston College's lead within a single touchdown and extra point. With 5:27 remaining in the half, the score was now 169 in favor of Boston College.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} former Drexel Burnham Lambert {{investment}} banker Ken Moelis marked a major coup for Costas. Moelis joined UBS from Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette in 2001 shortly after its acquisition by Credit Suisse <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> (although Huw Jenkins {{claimed he had}} hired Moelis to the UK Parliamentary Banking commission while under oath, which is patently false). In his six years at UBS, Moelis ultimately {{assumed the role of}} president of UBS Investment Bank and was credited, along with Costas, with the build-out of UBS's investment banking operation in the United States. Within weeks of joining, Moelis brought over a team of 70 bankers from Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Costas and Moelis hired more than 30 senior U.S. bankers from 2001 through 2004.|$|E

25|$|By 1880, the Massachusetts {{legislature}} authorized {{construction of}} an even grander library building. A site selected was in Back Bay on Copley Square – the prominent corner of Boylston Street and Dartmouth Street, opposite Richardson's Trinity Church and near the <b>first</b> <b>Boston</b> Museum of Fine Arts. After several years of debate over {{the selection of the}} architects and architectural style for the new library, in 1887 the prestigious New York firm of McKim, Mead, and White was chosen to design the new library. In 1888, Charles Follen McKim proposed a design based on the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, in a Renaissance style which met approval from the trustees of the library, and construction commenced. The vast new reading room was called Bates Hall.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{leaving the}} State Department, Holbrooke {{was asked by}} President Clinton to become, as a private citizen, a special envoy to the Balkans given his {{distinguished}} service in the region. Holbrooke left his post as {{assistant secretary of state}} for European and Canadian affairs and joined Credit Suisse <b>First</b> <b>Boston,</b> eventually taking the position of Vice Chairman. In 1997, Holbrooke became a special envoy to Cyprus and the Balkans on a pro-bono basis as a private citizen. During 1998 and 1999, in his capacity as special presidential envoy, Holbrooke worked to end the conflict between the armed forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), who were fighting for an independent Kosovo in the Kosovo War. Holbrooke returned to Bosnia two years later to the city of Sarajevo. In March 1999 he traveled to Belgrade to deliver the final ultimatum to Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević before the NATO attack began. Holbrooke wrote numerous articles about his experiences in the Balkans, and in 1998, published the widely acclaimed book, To End a War, a memoir of his time as the chief negotiator of the Dayton Peace Accords, ending the Bosnian civil war. The New York Times ranked the book as one of the eleven best books of the year in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Israel's {{thriving}} {{venture capital}} industry has {{played an important}} role in funding the country's booming high-technology sector. The country is now teeming with hundreds of prosperous Israeli private equity and venture firms looking to invest in the next potential million or billion dollar business startup. Many of Israel's venture capital firms have billions of dollars under management that are seeking to invest in domestic Israeli companies in order to create value by marking a strong presence across the country. The financial crisis of 2007–08 also affected the availability of venture capital locally. In 2009, there were 63 mergers and acquisitions in the Israeli market worth a total of $2.54 billion; 7% below 2008 levels ($2.74 billion), when 82 Israeli companies were merged or acquired, and 33% lower than 2007 proceeds ($3.79 billion) when 87 Israeli companies were merged or acquired. Numerous Israeli high tech companies have been acquired by global corporations for its reliable corporate management and quality personnel. In addition to venture capital funds, many of the world's leading investment banks, pension funds, and insurance companies have a strong presence in Israel committing their funds to financially back Israeli high-tech firms and benefit from its prosperous high tech sector. These institutional investors include Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Credit Swiss <b>First</b> <b>Boston,</b> Merrill Lynch, CalPERS, Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, and AIG.|$|E

When the junk bonds market crashed the following year, Gibbons couldn't repay <b>First</b> <b>Boston.</b> Credit Suisse injected $725 million to keep <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> in business, which ultimately led to the company being taken over by Credit Suisse.

500|$|Credit Suisse {{was founded}} in 1856 as Schweizerische Kreditanstalt (SKA, [...] ) jointly by Alfred Escher and the German bank [...] which held 50% of the equity. At {{inception}} time its primary purpose was to fund the development of Switzerland's rail system. It issued loans that helped create Switzerland's electrical grid and the European rail system. It also helped develop the country's currency system and funded entrepreneurship. In the 1900s Credit Suisse began shifting to retail banking {{in response to the}} elevation of the middle-class and the growing popularity of savings accounts. Credit Suisse partnered with <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> in 1978. After a large failed loan put <b>First</b> <b>Boston</b> under financial stress, Credit Suisse bought a controlling share of the bank in 1988.
