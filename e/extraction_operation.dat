25|$|As {{officers}} {{searched for}} shooters inside the building, others aided the wounded. Probation officers initially {{set up a}} makeshift triage center near {{the entrance of the}} building, but deemed it to be too close and relocated it across the street by 11:15a.m. Because survivors were soaked from water pouring from the fire sprinkler pipe, they became slippery for officers to hold. Injured victims were carried out by hand, with blankets, and even on chairs, as litters and tactical stretchers were unavailable at the time. An SBPD tactical medic supervised the <b>extraction</b> <b>operation.</b> It took 57 minutes to get the last of the injured to a hospital.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the deaths}} of {{two members of the}} New Zealand Battalion Group in late June and early August 2000, combat {{tracking}} support was requested from the NZSAS. In August 2000, a Troop of about 12 NZSAS combat trackers were deployed with the task of locating militia who were crossing the border into East Timor. The Troops' efforts lead to the successful placing of a number of ambushes, resulting in {{the deaths of}} three militia. In addition to performing combat tracking, on 6 September 2000, this Troop was utilised to conduct a permissive cross-border helicopter <b>extraction</b> <b>operation</b> of United Nations staff based at Atambua, West Timor.

When Blücher left Germany, she had about [...] of oil on board. She expended some of the fuel en route to Norway, and some was lost in the sinking, but she was constantly leaking oil. In 1991 the leakage rate increased to [...] per day, threatening the environment. The Norwegian government therefore decided to remove as much oil as possible from the wreck. In October 1994 the company Rockwater AS, together with deep sea divers drilled holes in 133 fuel tanks and removed [...] of oil; 47 fuel bunkers were unreachable and may still contain oil. After being run through a cleaning process, the oil was sold. The oil <b>extraction</b> <b>operation</b> provided an opportunity to recover one of Blüchers two Arado 196 aircraft.

Modern mining practices tend to favor dry mining rather than dredging operations, due to the advent of electrostatic mineral separation processes.|$|R
