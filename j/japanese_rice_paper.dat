40|$|This paper {{investigated}} consumers’ {{awareness and}} acceptance of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> in Beijing area. Data was collected through a face–to–face interview survey to consumers in six supermarkets in Beijing during December 2008 and January 2009. A total sample of 400 consumers participated in the survey. Data included socio–demographics and questions regarding their cognition, attitude and purchasing behavior on <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice.</b> The results obtained from the survey showed that consumers had relatively low cognition and acceptance on <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> and only 14. 8 % of the respondents had purchasing experience on <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice.</b> Although <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> maintained high quality property, high price, lack of purchasing motivation, and sufficient and satisfying rice supply from domestic market obstructed the good sales record of <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> in China. The bivariate probit model results showed that consumer’s gender, education level, monthly expense on foods, and time pressure significantly positively affected the consumers’ cognition level on <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice,</b> whileconsumers’ age and quantity concern degree negatively and significantly affected their awareness. As far as the purchasing behavior of consumers on <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice,</b> consumer’s gender, education level, family size, quantity and nutrition concern degreesignificantly and positively affected the consumers’ purchasing behavior on <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice,</b> while their monthly expense on food and quality concern degree negatively affected their purchase significantly.

Some accounts have it that it was the place where Cannastra had lived that Kerouac found a roll of <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> which he then used to write On the Road, though it appears this may be in error as more recent scholarship describes the On the Road [...] "scroll" [...] as [...] "telegraph paper".|$|E
5000|$|He {{would create}} his figures with India ink on <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> <b>paper,</b> drawing freehand, without a ruler or any {{mechanical}} device. He generally used [...] "Japanese perspective, where all parallel lines remain parallel {{and do not}} meet at points of visual convergence." [...] The shaky lines, often exacerbated by working on the ten hour train ride between Stockholm and Lund, is obvious {{in some of his}} pictures. Figures were frequently colored with Japanese colored chalk. In comparing his work to that of the much more famous artist of the impossible, M. C. Escher, it can be observed that Escher builds inhabited worlds around impossible objects, whereas Reutersvärd's designs generally consist of pure geometric forms.|$|E

Other popular {{variations}} are four, eight, and ten-pointed stars, while rarer ones sport six, seven, nine, and more than twelve points. The earliest parols were made from simple materials like bamboo, <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> (known as [...] "papél de Hapón") or crêpe paper, and were lit by a candle or coconut oil lamp. Simple parols can be easily constructed with just ten bamboo sticks, paper, and glue. Present-day parol has endless possible shapes and forms and is made of a variety of materials, such as cellophane, plastic, rope, capiz shell, glass, and even recycled refuse. Parol-making is a folk craft, and many Filipino children often craft them as a school project or for leisure.|$|E
40|$|I {{will have}} student-created print works {{installed}} on the exterior walls of buildings {{on the campus of}} Wayne State University during the MAPC conference. Additionally, I will have the same prints installed around the campus of the University of Toledo, thus bridging the two cities and creating one big connected “Print City”. Students will create large woodblock prints that would be adhered to exterior walls of buildings. These large images will be printed on <b>Japanese</b> Kozo (<b>rice</b> <b>paper).</b> The life span of these murals depends directly on exposure to weather. The paper will be adhered to the chosen site using water soluble “wheat paste,” a mixture of flour and water. As these prints will be outdoors, their existence can best be described as ephemeral. If needed, the murals could easily be removed by power washing with water. Participating students will scout out potential sites and collaboratively come up with concept sketches for their murals. The students will be required {{to take into account the}} history of their site and create an image that is visually pleasing but also pays homage to the site. I believe that the murals will spur interest in the history of both cities. As a result of this event, students will become more engaged in fabric of the community in which they place the prints. This project will also prompt folks to walk around both cities in search of the murals, creating a transformed community of newly engaged art enthusiasts. Because people will be out walking the city sidewalks, the project will have a positive impact on the community and the businesses of that area...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> {{market is}} an extreme example of {{national}} market protection in an industrialised country. As=a consequence of these protectionist policies, domestic prices average alrnost 4 times the world market price for comparable <b>rice</b> qualities. This <b>paper</b> discusses the obstacles {{on the way to}} political reform and to more openness of the rice trade. With the framework of a partial equilibriuin model we quantify the benefits that can be expected by extensive trade liberalisation and show that the <b>Japanese</b> consum~r and <b>rice</b> producers in developing countries largely carry the burden of the current system that only con-serves the highly inefficient <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> farrning structure. Our analysis shows that the curren ~ policies are economically not the best means to address the objectives targeted by the "neiv dgriculttiral policy " of Japan that promotes'inainly food security, multifunctional aspects of agriculture and the parity of rural- urban incotrie dis-tribution. On the contrary, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> policy appears to use these arguments only as pre-tence to justify its protectionist interventions. As an alternatiire, we develop･an example for the conversion to a direct payment system that targets the political objeqtives directly. and improves the competitiveness of rice production in Japan...|$|R

5000|$|It was in collage, though, that Ryan {{found her}} primary voice. She {{incorporated}} {{all kinds of}} papers and textiles into her collage compositions, including silk, netting, handmade rag paper, and <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> <b>paper.</b> Most were small in scale, averaging roughly eight by six inches. Many of the works were mounted on handmade paper by Douglas Morse Howell, who frequently collaborated with New York artists in the 1950s and 60s and often made paper from re-purposed textile fibers like blue jeans, or from flax grown in his backyard. Ryan's collages distilled and expanded upon this sensibility by juxtaposing small squares of different materials against one another to highlight the distinct textures and densities of each. Their small scale and her use of pastel colors provoked varying critical responses in the early 1950s; many writers commented on the works' [...] "feminine" [...] qualities.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the economic impact}} of regional integration on agricultural trade. Using a simple Krugman-type model with tariff distortions, two propositions on the impact of regionalism on trade flows are derived: (i) the impact of regional integration is stronger when the degree of pre-integration protection is higher; (ii) the impact is stronger when the degree of product differentiation is lower. Taken together, the two propositions predict that the impact of regionalism on agricultural trade is larger than on the manufacturing trade, because the initial level of protection is larger and the degree of product differentiation is smaller for agricultural products. The propositions are tested against the actual data at two incidences of EC expansion, i. e., the admittance of Greece in 1981 and of Spain and Portugal in 1986, and we found that the theory is generally supported by the data. After the theoretical and ex post analysis, the model is applied to examine the possible ex ante impact of the APEC free trade agreement on <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> imports, an issue on which, in spite of heated (emotional) debates, there have been no major studies. Contrary to the popular belief in Japan that when the <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> market is liberalized <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> production will be wiped out, the simulation result in the present paper suggests that the impact of partial liberalization of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> market under the APEC agreement would be relatively small although total liberalization would have a profound impact on <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> production...|$|R
50|$|Different {{varieties}} of rice need different cooking times, {{depending on their}} grain size, grain shape, and grain composition. There are three main types of Asian rice: Oryza sativa subsp. indica, i.e., Indian rice (long grain rice, e.g., basmati rice and Thai jasmine rice), O. sativa subsp. javanica, i.e., Java rice (large grain rice) and O. sativa subsp. japonica, i.e., <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> (medium grain rice, e.g., Calrose rice, short grain <b>rice,</b> e.g., most <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> and risotto rice).|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} shows that the <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> policy has affected the volume of exported and imported rice; moreover, multilateral and bilateral agreements have also affected <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> policy. Japan's institution of subsidies and trade barriers has made its rice products too expensive for foreign trade and its domestic consumers. Since the WTO agreement has forced Japan to open its market gradually over six years, Japan may be unable to compete internationally because of its limited land, high labor costs, and the field utility fees...|$|R
40|$|To obtain basic {{information}} for palatability breeding of japonica–type paddy rice in China, we collected 260 varieties from northern area of China, and examined their physicochemical properties (amylose and protein contents of polished rice, breakdown value of polished rice flour and hardness/adhesion ratio of cooked rice). In all physicochemical properties, genetic variation was larger in Chinese rice varieties than in <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> varieties. In Chinese rice varieties, amylose content showed a negative correlation with breakdown value and positive correlation with hardness/adhesion ratio as in <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> varieties. However, the protein content showed a negative correlation with amylose content and positive correlation with breakdown value, {{in contrast to}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>rice</b> varieties. Among the 260 varieties examined, Zaoyou 3, Liaohui 253 – 2, Jing 350 and E 35 – 6 had superior physicochemical properties as in palatable Japanese varieties.

50|$|There {{are seven}} steps {{in making the}} dish: {{steeping}} the rice, husking the rice, mixing the flour, spreading the flour, drying the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> in the sun, grilling the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> and wetting the paper by dew in the night. Commonly used rice strains are Bằng Cóc rice, So Miên rice or Nàng Miên rice. Rice is soaked in water equal to the volume of rice. If it is soaked too long, the rice will lose its fragrance. The soaked rice is mixed with salt and grilled, spread over a flat pan in a very thin round shape. When spreading, the water temperature must be kept constant. The next piece is spread over the pan just as the last piece is removed, and skilled workers time the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> cooking process by smelling the smoke. Next, the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> is spread over a bamboo grid and left to dry in the sun, and wind. If the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> is left to dry too long, it will be brittle, but if not left to dry long enough, it will be tough. The <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> is then grilled over a fire of peanut shells, and the cooks turn the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> over regularly {{to prevent it from}} being burned or smoke-stained. When night dews begin to drop, the <b>rice</b> <b>paper</b> is left outside to be wetted by the dew; the length of time it's left outside depends on the amount of dew which falls that day.|$|R
