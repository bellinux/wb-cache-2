40|$|The {{ability of}} the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium to degrade {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are present in <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> (a distillation product obtained from coal tar) was demonstrated. Analysis by capillary gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography showed that at least 22 PAHs, including all of the most abundant PAH components present in <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil,</b> underwent 70 to 100 % disappearance during 27 days of incubation with nutrient nitrogen-limited cultures of this fungus. Because phenanthrene is the most abundant PAH present in <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil,</b> this PAH was selected for further study. In experiments in which [14 C]phenanthrene was incubated with cultures of P. chrysosporium containing <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> for 27 days, it was shown that 7. 7 % of the recovered radiolabeled carbon originally present in [14 C]phenanthrene was metabolized to 14 CO 2 and 25. 2 % was recovered from the aqueous fraction, while 56. 1 and 11. 0 % were recovered from the methylene chloride and particulate fractions, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography of the 14 C-labeled material present in the methylene chloride fraction revealed that most (91. 9 %) of this material was composed of polar metabolites of [14 C]phenanthrene. These results suggest that this microorganism may be useful for the decontamination of sites in the environment contaminated with PAHs...|$|R

40|$|When certain {{oils and}} {{polymers}} are heated under an inert atmosphere, a high viscosity liquid forms. Examples include crude oil, coal tar, and PVC. Upon further heating, this liquid becomes a progressively harder solid called pitch. Pitch that contains crystalline areas is called mesophase pitch. Mesophase pitch {{is required for}} the production of graphite. The purpose of the research was to investigate whether <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> can be used for the production of mesophase pitch for sintering purposes. Sintering involves heating a powder under pressure to produce a solid. <b>Anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> is a low-value by-product of coke production from coal. Despite its low market value, it has unique properties. It consists primarily of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and it is free of primary quinoline insoluble material. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are the precursors for mesophase pitch formation, while quinoline insoluble material hinders mesophase growth. These attributes make it a good potential starting material for the production of mesophase pitch, which may be used for sintering and carbon fibre production. In the search for a mesophase pitch that can be sintered, a variety of pitches were produced from <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> This was done by varying the heat treatment time and temperature. The pitches produced were characterised to determine their glass transition temperature, melting temperature, carbon yield and optical microstructure. This was done to determine their sintering potential. A high mesophase content, high softening temperature and high carbonisation yield were considered essential for effective sintering. Pitches with a high mesophase content were produced. Longer heat treatment led to higher carbon yields, higher glass transition temperatures, higher softening temperatures and higher mesophase content.

40|$|The main {{feedstocks}} for {{the production}} of oil-furnace carbon black are different kinds of liquid hydrocarbons. The quality and utilization of oil-furnace carbon black mainly depends on the type of liquid hydrocarbons contained in the oil feedstocks. In practice, both carbochemical and petrochemical oils are used as feedstock sources. Carbochemical oils are fractions obtained during coal tar distillation. <b>Anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> is one of these oils. Depending on the conditions of distillation, coal tars contain up to w = 18 · 10 – 2 highly aromatic fractions, which can be used as carbon black feedstock. The sulphur fraction of these oils can vary between w = 0. 5 and 0. 7 · 10 – 2, depending on the origin of the coal. The availability of carbochemical oils obtained from coal tar is largely dependent on the production of coke used in the manufacture of steel. The quantities available today are insufficient to satisfy the demand for carbon black feedstock. In addition, in highly industrialized countries, production of carbochemicaloils is declining. Although, carbochemical oils are preferred in terms of efficiency, petrochemical oils are more important in terms of quantities available, particularly in the production of furnace blacks. These are residual oils resulting either from catalytic cracking processes or from the production of olefins in steam crackers using naphtha or gas oil as raw material. Nevertheless, the choice of carbon black feedstock is not determined merely by price and efficiency, but also by specific quality criteria. However, due to their origin, the feedstocks are mixtures {{of a large number of}} individual substances and are, therefore, not easy to characterize. More than 200 different components have been recorded in the range detectable by gas chromatography. Some important components of carbon black feedstock are listed in table 1. 1 An important parameter for the evaluation of carbon black feedstock is density, since it increases with increasing aromaticity. It is also used for determination of the Bureau of Mines Correlation Index (BMCI), 2 which is obtained either from density and midboiling point, or from density andviscosity for those feedstocks which cannot be distilled completely. This index is used by the carbon black industry as an important criteria for feedstock evaluation. The sulphur fraction in feedstocks should not exceed w = 2. 5 · 10 – 2, because a higher content greatly affects the quality of carbon black, pollutes the atmosphere, and accelerates corrosion of the facility. The maximum sulphur content in the typical hydrocarbon feedstock is w = 1. 2 · 10 – 2. 3. A very important factor of hydrocarbon feedstock is the fraction of alkaline earth metals, especially sodium and potassium. The maximum sodium fraction may be w = 20 · 10 – 6, while the maximum potassium fraction is w = 2 · 10 – 6. The maximum fraction of asphalthenes is w = 15 · 10 – 2. Asphalthenes, determined as pentane-insoluble matter, provide indications concerning the possibility of grit formation. Another very important factor is the temperature range of distillation, which should be low enough, because the hydrocarbon feedstock must evaporize before entering the hot region of the reactor. The viscosity, the pour point, and for safety reasons, the flash point determines the handling properties and storage conditions of the feedstock. In addition, the water fraction in the hydrocarbon feedstock is one of the most important factors. The water fraction in hydrocarbon feedstock influences the handling properties of the same. The maximum water fraction in hydrocarbon feedstock may be w = 2. 0 · 10 – 2, and desirably below w = 1. 0 · 10 – 2. A higher water fraction represent a considerable impact on the financial construction. Also, it is very difficult to manipulate such feedstock, especially unloading, and in the production of oil-furnace carbon black. Namely, every water fraction higher than w = 2. 0 · 10 – 2 in the hydrocarbon feedstock, causes the phenomenon of cavitations. In the oil-furnace carbon black plant of Petrokemija d. d. Kutina, the storage tank TK 48003, was filled with 800 tons of <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> The average water fraction in the tank was w = 10 · 10 – 2. It was impossible to manipulate in the process of production, because the mentioned water fraction caused the cavitations effect. Therefore, it was necessary to decrease the water fraction to below w = 2. 0 · 10 – 2, which will be satisfactory for production. As the water and <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> formed a homogeneous emulsion (similar density at all temperatures), it was impossible to manage decanting the water from the <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> Additionally, it was impossible to manage evaporation of the water from the oil by heating the whole emulsion,because the flash point of <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> is in the temperature range of T = 100 to 105 °C. Distillation of the whole emulsion of 800 tons was also impossible, because there was no distillation column adequate for separating the water from the <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> Thus, the use of different demulsifiers proved as a potential solution for separating the homogeneous mixture of <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> and water. Namely, demulsifiers are a special type of high molecular tensides and organic solvents, which serve for separation the water from different hydrocarbons. The most common use is in emulsions with “lighter” hydrocarbons, especially when the density is not above r= 0. 850 g cm – 3. Since the density of <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> ranges from r= 1. 05 to 1. 09 g cm – 3, it was necessary to customise the conditions of application, and to choose the mostadequate demulsifier for the separation of water from <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> Therefore, we experimented with different kinds of demulsifiers in cooperation with the companies TEH PROJEKT KEMO d. o. o. and KEM PROJEKT d. o. o.

The anthracene was obtained from industrial anthracene by crystallization in raw pyridine and was subjected to thermal polycondensation under pressure with various time exposures at the final temperature at 420 °C.

The ability of mesophase formation from obtained polycondensates was also studied. Besides thermogravimetric analysis and Raman spectroscopy, the optical microscopy was also used to determine the presence of optically anisotropic texture.

40|$|Eskom has {{embarked}} {{on the development of}} the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor to generate electricity at low cost compared to that of coal with no greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed PBMR requires about 600 tons of nuclear-grade graphite blocks in its construction. A considerable amount of pitch is required as impregnants for the manufacture of this graphite. <b>Anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> is a high-boiling coal-tar distillate fraction consisting of a complex mixture of mainly unsubstituted polyaromatic hydrocarbons, with some methyl substitution. Conversion to pitch may be effected by dehydrogenation, i. e. volatile oil molecules condensing together to yield material of high molecular mass. Two dehydrogenation reagents, elemental sulfur and a novel reagent, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), an industrial waste product, were used to give three series of pitches with differing softening points. These products were characterised by standard pitch analyses, elemental analyses, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 HNMR), gas chromatography (GC), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), Maldi-TOF mass and mass probe spectrometry and then compared with commercial pitch grades from Mittal Coke and Chemicals. The results obtained showed that the reaction products reacted with 15 and 20 wt % of sulfur, with the softening points of 61. 3 and 91. 4 °C, would be suitable as commercial products. All pitches showed very little, if any, ash, making them suitable for use in the manufacture of high-purity graphite. Pitches prepared with 15 - 20 wt % of sulfur and HCH pitches may have more applications in impregnation because of their low QI content. Total sulfur content detected by elemental analysis is high. This is undesirable because sulfur may cause puffing which will result in poor quality of graphite. All pitches show very little, if any, ash, making them suitable for use in the manufacture of high-purity graphite. TGA results showed that pitches prepared with higher concentrations of sulfur can be suitably used as impregnants because of their high coking yields. The coking yields of HCH-derived pitches are lower than those of Mittal Coke and Chemicals commercial pitches. Results from the (1 HNMR showed that cross-linking on reaction with sulfur is through aliphatic carbon atoms; the percentages of aliphatic protons decrease with the increase in the sulfur concentration, and aromatic percentages increase. There is a slight increase in the proportion of aromatic protons of the HCH pitches; therefore cross linking is through aromatic-aromatic carbon atoms. Model reactions were prepared by reacting pure aromatic hydrocarbons with HCH, demonstrating the incorporation of the dehydrogenation reagent. These reactions were used to determine the reactivity of the main components of <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> The reaction products were characterised by Maldi-TOF and GC-MS.

30|$|Coal {{consists}} of two components—organic matter (carbonaceous matrix) and inorganic matter (mineral matter). Organic matter can be extracted using solvent extraction which leaves behind solvent refined clean coal product which has negligible ash contents (Kihong et al. 2016). The role of the solvent is to break the coal–coal interactions {{and replace it with}} the coal solvent interactions. Coal being a heterogeneous polymer shows a tendency to swell in organic solvents (Takanohashi and Iino 1995; Hernández et al. 2012; Hu et al. 1998; Mathews et al. 2015). Some solvents that have the characteristic property of donating a pair of electrons show good swelling. Mostly N and O donors are considered to be good solvents for coal extraction. Swelling gives a good idea of the extent of coal interaction with the solvent that may not necessarily always account for good extraction e.g. ethylenediammine (EDA) (Krevelen 1993). Early studies on coal extraction include the use of some basic solvents such as benzene, CHCl 3, alcohol, ether, carbon disulphide as reported by Van Krevalan (1993). Coal derived solvents are also used for extraction. Coal tar and coal tar pitch were used by Honda et al. Higher boiling fractions like <b>anthracene</b> <b>oils</b> gave better extraction yields (Mishra and Sharma 1990; Elliott 1981). About 95 % extraction yield has been reported by Orchin et al. with the use of boiling phenanthrene as a solvent (Krevelen 1993).|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} {{and development of}} mesophase from different pitches under carbonisation conditions was investigated. Members of the pyrolysis series were prepared from four pitches. A temperature range between 380 and 500 °C was used to follow mesophase development for each pitch. As-received pitches and their green cokes were characterised by thermomechanical analysis (glass transition temperature and softening point temperature), elemental analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry or differential thermogravimetry, and optical microscopy (mesophase content). Additional data about the evolution of different volatile products and about possible chemical reactions occurring during thermal decomposition were obtained from thermogravimetric mass spectrometric analysis. The effect of heating rate on the behaviour and carbon yield was also studied. The {{results showed that the}} two <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil</b> pitches do not develop mesophase, whereas the medium-temperature and high-temperature pitches do. However, their textures are completely different. The medium-temperature pitch shows an improvement in texture from the mosaic to the coarse domain at 500 °C, whereas the high-temperature pitch shows flow domains. It was further shown that the process of preparing mesophase, i. e. the heat-treatment process, increases the aromaticity and carbon yield. Thermogravimetric mass spectrometric analysis showed that the dominant reaction for all the pitches is the condensation reaction, which is accompanied by the evolution of H 2 and CO. The heating rate affects the behaviour of the pyrolysing pitches in that a lower heating rate lowers the carbon yield.

40|$|Microautoclave tests {{confirmed}} that first-stage subbituminous coal conversions were greater {{in a more}} aromatic first-stage solvent. First-stage liquefaction tests with hydride ion `E` showed that high coal conversions can be obtained {{with a number of}} different first-stage water-gas-shift catalysts. Eight one-liter autoclave tests were completed. All tests used Black Thunder Mine subbituminous coal and Reilly Industries <b>anthracene</b> <b>oil.</b> Differences among the tests were the hydride ion reagent used, the post-run flash of water, and the shift catalyst. Filtration tests were conducted with five one-liter autoclave products of subbituminous coal. The filtration rates were slower than those that had been obtained with North Dakota lignite products, but were still within a commercially acceptable range. The influence of the first-stage shift catalyst on filtration rates is being investigated. Second-stage hydrotreating of products of tests made to simulate the British coal LSE process and the Wilsonville pilot plant preheaters had lower resid conversion and higher hydrogen uptake than the products of the hydride ion liquefaction reaction. The 300 mL second-stage reactor system went on line this quarter. Refinements in the experimental procedures are under way. A conceptual commercial plant design for the hydride ion reagent `A` case was completed. Evaluations of hydride ion reagent `D` and `E` cases were initiated, and an integrated liquefaction system balance for the hydride ion reagent `E` case was begun. A preliminary review of the final technical and economic reports from the Alberta Research Council study of low-rank coal conversion using the CO-steam process generated a number of questions on the published reports; further analysis of the reports is planned...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the influence of different stressors, including cadmium (<b>heavy</b> metal), <b>anthracene</b> (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon— PAH) and chloridazon (herbicide), on population growth and biosynthesis of cytoplasmic HSP 70 in Lemna minor (duckweed) in short (4 h) - and long (7 days) -term tests. A heat shock response was confirmed in Lemna exposed to high temperature: 35, 37. 5, 40, or 42. 5 °C in short-term (4 h) treatments. The chemicals tested stimulated the biosynthesis of the cytoplasmic HSP 70 protein in a concentration-dependent way (0. 5 – 5 lM), higher in fronds exposed to lower doses of stressors. Additionally, production of HSP 70 was greater after 4 h of incubation than after 7 days. The results suggest that HSP 70 could be applied as a non-specific and sensitive detector of stress induced by different chemicals at concentrations below those that produce the type of response observed in classical cytotoxicity tests, such as growth inhibition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to determine whether dietary grapeseed oil inhibits liver cytotoxicity induced by 7, 12 - dimethylbenz(a) anthracene (DMBA) in the frog, Rana ridibunda. The experimental animals were divided into five groups and treated for 2 weeks with 7, 12 - dimethylbenz(a) anthracene, DMBA plus grapeseed oil, grapeseed oil, olive oil and last group was untreated and used as control. Liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, glutamic oxaloacetic acid transaminase, glutamic pyruvic acid transaminase and alkaline phosphatase were chosen to assess liver function. In comparison with control, the administration of DMBA alone significantly elevated the activity of liver lactate dehydrogenase, while the activities of glutamic oxaloacetic acid transaminase, glutamic pyruvic acid transaminase and alkaline phosphatase were declined. Similar results were noted in frogs treated with DMBA plus grapeseed oil. Moreover, it is found that the changes were more pronounced in frogs treated with DMBA plus grapeseed oil than those treated with DMBA. The activities of these enzymes in frogs exposed to grapeseed oil or olive oil were not significantly different from those of controls. These results indicate that grapeseed oil effectively increases DMBA-induced hepatotoxicity in the frogs. Also, the results suggested that grapeseed oil has enhancing effects of DMBA metabolic activation.

40|$|We {{collected}} three composite {{fish and}} three composite sediment {{samples from the}} Big Blue River in southeastern Nebraska to determine the presence of agricultural chemicals or other contaminants. Inorganic analyses consisted of individual analyses for arsenic, selenium, and mercury, {{as well as an}} ICP scan for other elements. Organic analyses included organochlorines, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, organophosphate and carbamate pesticides, and chlorphenoxy acid herbicides. Arsenic was detected in the sediment samples, but not in the fish samples. Selenium was detected in one of three sediment samples and in all fish samples. Mercury was not detected in sediment samples, but was detected in all fish samples. Organic compounds detected in composite fish samples include BHC compounds, chlordane compounds, DDT and its metabolites, and <b>anthracene.</b> Outside of <b>oil</b> and grease, organic compounds were not detected in any sediment sample...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the differences between}} cancerous tissue, drug treated tissue and its corresponding normal tissue by infrared spectroscopic analysis. Methods: Methanolic extracts of Azadirachta indica, Ocimum sanctum, Aloe barbandesis, Tinospora cordifolia and Triticum aestivum were assessed for the isolation and purification of active compound. After that, combine crude and combine isolated samples were prepared. Skin tumor was induced by topical application of 7, 12 -dimethyl benz (a) anthracene and promoted by croton oil in Swiss albino mice. To assess the chemopreventive potential of different drugs, it was administered at a concentration of 400 mg/kg body weight daily up to 16 weeks. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy {{analysis was used to}} differentiate the drug treated tissues with the normal and cancerous tissue. In the present study, spectra of different tissues were recorded in the range of 400 - 4 000 cm- 1. Results: The {{results of the present study}} have shown that the remarkable difference exists between the IR spectra of normal, drugs treated and cancerous tissue in terms of frequencies and intensities of prominent bands of cellular biomolecules. Conclusions: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis suggests the chemopreventive effect of above treated drugs and the best result was observed in combine crude sample and in combine isolated sample or synergistic effect of individual crude and isolated extract in 7, 12 -dimethyl benz (a) <b>anthracene</b> croton <b>oil</b> induced skin carcinogenesis in Swiss albino mice...|$|R
40|$|The joint {{impact of}} UV-B {{radiation}} and temperature on photodegradation of {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) sorbed to an organic solvent was assessed in this study. This approach was experimentally performed in a laboratory investigation by means of comparison of two different environments: Atlantic (Lancaster, UK) and Mediterranean (Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain) climatic conditions. The concentration of 10 PAHs contained in a tetradecane solution was compared under two different temperatures (10 and 20 °C) and UV-B doses (6. 5 and 22. 5 kJ m− 2 day− 1). No photodegradation was observed for the <b>heaviest</b> hydrocarbons (benzo(a) <b>anthracene,</b> chrysene, benzo(a) pyrene, dibenzo(g,h,i) perylene and coronene). In general terms, the half-life of PAHs was highly dependent on their molecular weight. Significant faster photodegradation rates were detected specially for light PAHs. It indicates that a synergistic effect occurred when both temperature and UV-B dose increased. This synergism might have a great implication on the long-range transport of environmental organic pollutants {{taking into account that}} low-latitude areas are the hottest and most irradiated of the planet...|$|R
