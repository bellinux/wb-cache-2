40|$|We {{developed}} two infrared BatCams {{capable of}} censusing emerging bats—a remote controlled, panzoom-tilt camera, and a fixed focal-length lens camera. The remote-controlled BatCam {{consists of a}} small, weatherized <b>Internet</b> <b>camera</b> connected to a local video server and gateway for Internet access. The server enables video recording at predetermined intervals corresponding to expected nightly emergence. Internet connectivity allows sampling the real-time video from off-site. A second BatCam mounted inside a small, weatherized, transparent Pelican case recorded data directly to a laptop computer. Using both BatCam’s, we successfully censused a small bat colony of little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) that emerged nightly through two small portals. Bats in each video frame were first detected using custom-designed computer vision algorithms using background modeling that first compared bats with {{an estimate of the}} background images. A second algorithm tracked each newly detected bat through the camera’s field of view. Advantages and disadvantages of each camera system are considered...|$|E

An algorithm of group-based histo-gram (GBH) is proposed {{to build the}} background Gaussian model of each pixel from traffic image sequences. This algorithm features improved robustness against transient stop of foreground objects and sensing noise. Furthermore, the method features low computational load, thus meets the real-time requirements in many practical applications. The proposed method {{has been applied to}} a vision-based traffic parameter estimation system to segment moving vehicles from image sequences. Given degraded compressive traffic images from on-line <b>internet</b> <b>cameras,</b> the image processing system successfully detect various vehicles in the traffic imagery.

40|$|With {{the recent}} clamour for an ICT-based {{government}} (e-Government) by the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), better services are expected through e-health, e-education, e-business, e-police, and e-judiciary to mention just a few. Particularly, in a developing economy like Africa where governance {{is characterized by}} hunger, poverty, sickness, unemployment and war. E-Government will guarantee better quality services, transparency, economic empowerment, and higher productivity without gender discrimination. This paper considers a robust e-policing system which is prime to e-Government and will guarantee a safe, secure, and crime-free environment for all and most importantly {{an environment that is}} conducive for foreign investment. This system incorporates Electronic Driving License (EDL) for tracking traffic offenders, enhanced e-surveillance through the deployment of <b>internet</b> <b>camera</b> and distributed patrol vehicles equipped with both electronic and mobile devices and possibly incorporating a Global Positioning System (GPS) for fast tracking of offenders. The system ensures an increased police presence in the community which places a check on crime rate.

40|$|This paper {{starts with}} the concept of a virtual gallery where art works, mainly pictures, are {{presented}} on the world wide web. One of the first such galleries, the Slovenian Virtual Gallery existing from 1995 is being considered. Today, such galleries are conceptually not much different, however, they typically contain much more material of higher resolution in 2 D and 3 D. Several open source tools are available for development of such virtual galleries. To gain some notion of immediacy, efforts were made to mix such virtual worlds with live video from actual spaces and locations. A novel user interface was developed using panoramic images of the location where the <b>internet</b> <b>camera</b> is located. The live video image is shown overlaid on the static panoramic image so that when a tele-operator manipulates the camera he gets a much better understanding of the remote location. A new media art installation was produced. First, successfully the concept of the virtual gallery and the live video panoramic interface and later interactive art installations was taken up where video or images were used as primary means of interaction and feedback. Five such art installations are presented; the sixth project shows how this concept can be applied to adaptive digital signage...|$|E

40|$|With {{easy access}} to technology, the problem of {{adolescent}} cyberbullying has increased. Though bullying still occurs in the traditional form of face-to-face contact, cyberbullying is becoming more common as youth have more access to the <b>Internet,</b> <b>cameras,</b> and text messaging via cell phones. Cyberbullying has {{many of the same}} effects on its victims, such as a decreased interest in school, lower academic achievement, and depression. The impact and strategies used in Cyberbullying will be compared to those of traditional bullying. Frequency and demographics of cyberbullying will be discussed as well as ramifications and steps adults can take to help prevent and react to cyberbullying instances. In addition to warning signs that adults can look for to recognize cyberbullying, factors that put children at risk will also be identified. The literature review concludes with ideas for educators and parents to consider when helping recognize and prevent cyberbullying. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} Automated Face Tracking, {{which is a}} major {{challenge}} for applications related to intelligent surveillance, law enforcement, telecommunications, human-computer interactions and virtual reality interfaces. The thesis describes a novel strategy for both face tracking and facial feature detection. Face detection {{is important because it}} restricts the field of view and thus reduces the amount of computation for further face recognition or transmission, while facial feature detection is important because it enables face normalization and leads to size invariant face recognition. Resembling the way of human perceiving face and facial features, the proposed face tracker initially utilizes motion as the major cues, then human eyes are searched from the area which likely contains a human face. The contributions of this thesis are threefold. First, we have introduced an effective system architecture including a system supervisor controlling five virtual perceptual sensor processes. Second, we have advanced a hybrid approach for face detection and facial feature extraction. An adapted Hough Transform is introduced in search of human eyes within the candidate face region. Finally, implementation issues are explored when using a low-cost <b>Internet</b> <b>camera</b> under a common Windows environment. Methods of using Microsoft Video for Windows (VFW) and real-time programming approaches are employed in this specific face tracking application.

40|$|The {{dawn of the}} {{personal}} computer era {{gave birth to a}} new type of criminal, the hacker. Today there is a new even more attractive target for hackers to exploit, the Android smartphones. These devices allow us to use <b>internet,</b> <b>camera,</b> GPS tracking, and more features. Smartphones also contain detailed records of our contacts and SMS. The hacker then uses these records for committing identity theft. Hence to provide security to Android smartphone we have developed a circular screen locking application. This application provides various features like unlock phone using random number, taking system backup via email, receive notification of SIM change via message, track incoming calls and messages when our smartphone is lost or stolen. This helps user to know who is calling and sending messages on their device. Hence this application satisfies the need of today’s users & applications. authentication for the user’s convenience and provide a good security system for smartphones [4]. 2.

If a user has a non-stock Android device like the Galaxy S 3, then there are some differences in functionality {{but for the most part}} they all act in a similar fashion [1]. First, to access the lock screen options, the universal location tends to be in Settings-Security.
