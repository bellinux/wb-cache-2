50|$|A spike strip (also {{known as}} traffic spikes, tire shredders, one-way traffic treadles, stingers, stop sticks, a stinger in police slang, and {{formally}} {{known as a}} tire deflation device) is a device used to impede or stop the movement of wheeled vehicles by puncturing their tires. Generally, the strip is composed {{of a collection of}} 35 to 75 mm (1.5 to 3 inches) long metal <b>s,</b> <b>teeth</b> or spikes pointing upward. The barbs are designed to puncture and flatten tires when a vehicle is driven over them. The barbs may be hollow or solid.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the factors influencing tooth eruption is important given the association between altered eruption patterns and crowded or decayed teeth. Hence, the aims of this study were to quantify the extent of asymmetry in tooth eruption and to determine whether eruption asymmetry was significantly influenced by sex, tooth position or timing of emergence. Additionally, directionality of asymmetry and variation between ethnic groups were also explored. Data collection was based on the examination of serial dental casts from a sample of 90 Aborigines (50 male, 40 female) aged 6 to 18 years from the Yuendumu settlement in the Northern Territory of Australia. These casts were obtained at yearly intervals from the 1950 s to the early 1970 <b>s.</b> <b>Tooth</b> antimeres on each cast were compared using a 4 -grade eruption score.

Sponsorship: National Science Foundation grants EAR- 0228876 (GSS) and EAR- 0228853 (EEW). Grant number 2002 - 33 of the Ohio University Research Council (GSS); De Beers Africa ExplorationPotholes carved into streambeds can be important components of channel incision, {{but they have}} received little quantitative attention. Here empirical evidence is presented from three sites along the Orange River, Republic of South Africa that demonstrates that the pothole dimensions of radius and depth are strongly correlated using a simple power law. Where radius is the dependent variable, the exponent of the power law describes {{the rate of increase}} in radius with increasing depth. Erosion within potholes is complexly related to erosion on the adjacent bed. Erosion efficiencies within small, hemispherical potholes must be high if the potholes are to survive in the face of bed translation (incision). As potholes deepen, however, the necessary efficiencies decline rapidly. Increasing concavity associated with growth imposes stricter constraints; comparatively deep potholes must erode orders of magnitude larger volumes of substrate than shallower potholes in the face of bed retreat. Hemispherical potholes are eventually converted to cylindrical potholes, the geometries of which favor enlargement while they are small. Geometric models constructed using the power law show unambiguously that more substrate is eroded by volume from cylindrical pothole walls during growth than from cylindrical pothole floors. Grinders thus play a secondary role to suspended sediment entrained within the vortices that occur in potholes. Continued growth leads to coalescence with other potholes or destruction through block detachment depending on local geology. The combination of geology and erosion mechanisms may determine whether a strath or inner channel develops {{as a consequence of the}} process. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The United States (U. S.) has a {{persistent}} problem of dental caries in primary teeth {{with a greater}} prevalence of dental caries found in minority and poor children. The majority {{of children in the}} U. S. experience dental caries in their primary teeth by age eight. This problem could be addressed by primary care providers applying fluoride varnish (FV) to children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>teeth</b> starting at the age of primary tooth eruption. The causes of dental caries in children’s primary teeth are multifactorial and therefore require multiple interventions. Around the world providers are utilizing FV as an effective and easily administered strategy. This author implemented a quality improvement project of a FV application program in a Vermont pediatric practice, based on a United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guideline. Methods: After thorough preparation a staff training in FV application was done for providers and staff along with the pre-project questionnaire. The DNP student consulted with providers, registered nurses (RNs), the billing person and the office receptionist to determine the number of eligible patients who received FV. Qualitative data about facilitators and barriers to FV application were collected. At the conclusion of 4 months a post-questionnaire was done and a debrief of the project.

40|$|In this work, we have {{investigated}} three different research problems. In the first chapter, we introduce an imaging colorimeter for measuring tooth color {{that is based}} on two exposures with a digital camera using two different filters. We describe new procedures for alignment and calibration of the system. We also consider three different sources of illumination. We propose two approaches to estimating tooth color information from the acquired camera data, both of which employ linear regression. In the first approach, we estimate CIE XYZ coordinates of the tooth under a pre-selected illuminant. In the second approach, we estimate the spectral reflectance of the tooth, thus enabling us to predict tristimulus values under any illuminant. Finally, we present results from in vivo measurement of subject 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>teeth.</b> ^ In the second chapter, a subspace matching method is developed to design color filters for a multi-spectral imaging system to capture the spectral reflectance of surfaces accurately with minimal number of measurements.

A {{comparison}} of mud- and sand-dominated meanders in a downstream coarsening {{reach of the}} mixed bedrock-alluvial Klip River, eastern Free State, South Africa. Sedimentary Geology, 190 (1 - 4), 213 - 226. Along a 28 km reach of the Klip River, eastern Free State, South Africa, mud- and sand-dominated meanders have developed in close proximity within a floodplain wetland up to 1. 5 km wide, providing an unusual opportunity to compare their characteristics under similar hydrological conditions. Throughout the reach, the channel bed is grounded on sandstone/shale bedrock although the banks are alluvial, and most river activity occurs during summer high flows. The reach {{can be divided into}} three geomorphological zones: Zone 1 (0 ? 11 km), a muddy proximal part with a single meandering channel (w/d < 10) and near-permanent standing water in oxbows and backswamps; Zone 2 (11 ? 17. 5 km), a transitional mud-to-sand part with one main channel (w/d not, vert, similar 20 ? 30), a number of sinuous palaeochannels and oxbows, and only limited standing water; and Zone 3 (17. 5 ? 28 km), a sandy distal part with a single meandering channel (w/d not, vert, similar 15 ? 30), scroll bars and oxbows, and little standing water. Each zone also has a distinctive sedimentology: Zone 1 is characterised by an not, vert, similar 3 ? 4 m thick succession of basal sand and minor granules overlain by dominantly muddy sediment deposited primarily by oblique accretion in meander bends; Zone 2 is characterised by < 4 m of interbedded sand and mud deposited primarily by lateral point-bar accretion, although a history of avulsions also attests to the importance of abandoned-channel accretion; and Zone 3 is characterised by < 3 m of dominantly sand deposited primarily by lateral point-bar accretion. This unusual downstream sediment coarsening trend, and the associated changes in channel and floodplain character, are independent of sediment inputs from tributaries, and result from a downstream increase in bankfull unit stream power from < 3. 5 W m? 2 (Zone 1) to not, vert, similar 4 ? 10 W m? 2 (Zone 3). Mud is deposited primarily in low-energy Zone 1 but is conveyed in suspension more effectively through higher energy Zones 2 and 3, only forming drapes over sandy lateral accretion deposits during waning flood stages. The downstream increase in unit stream power is controlled in part by a slight downstream increase in floodplain gradient that may be related to a subtle variation in the erosional resistance of the bedrock underlying the channel bed. These findings add to previous work on meandering rivers by demonstrating that mud-dominated meanders can occur in long-term erosional settings where the channel bed is grounded on bedrock, and that downstream fining trends may be reversed locally.

It {{is the latest in}} the Oral health and dental care in Australia: key facts and figures suite of printed publications and web products. Oral health The major measures of oral health in Australia suggest that there have been improvements over the long term. In recent years, however, there is some indication that the positive trends have either plateaued or have begun to head in a negative direction. For example: 	From 1977 to 1995, data from examination of school-aged  children in school dental services suggests there was a steady drop in the average number of children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> baby <b>teeth</b> affected by decay. There has, however, been a gradual rise from 1996. 	Between 1987 - 88 and 2004 - 06, national surveys reported a decrease in the average number of teeth affected by decay (caries experience) in adults. 	From 1994 to 2010, the proportion of people aged 15 and over reporting any adverse oral health impact generally rose from survey to survey, with exceptions in 2002 and 2010. The proportion ranged between 31. 4...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: To {{assess the}} impact of {{different}} implant systems on the clinical conditions and the microbiota at implants, and whether the presence of bacteria at tooth sites was predictive of the presence at implant sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects with either AstraTech or Brånemark in function for 7 years were enrolled. Sub-gingival bacterial samples at tooth and implant sites were collected with sterile endodontic paper points, and analyzed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method (40 species). RESULTS: Fifty-four subjects, 27 supplied with AstraTech (n= 132 implants) and 27 with Brånemark (n= 102) implants, were studied. Test tooth sites had significantly less evidence of bleeding on probing (P< 0. 001) and presence of plaque (P< 0. 001) than implant test sites. Implant sites presented with deeper probing pocket depth than tooth sites (mean difference: 1. 1 mm, standard error of differences: 0. 08, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 0. 9 - 1. 3, P< 0. 001). Tannerella forsythia (P< 0. 05), Capnocytophaga sputigena (P< 0. 05), Actinomyces israelii (P< 0. 05) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (P< 0. 05) were found at higher levels at tooth surfaces. No differences in bacterial load for any species were found between the two implant systems. The odds of being present/absent at tooth and implants sites were only significant for Staphylococcus aureus [odds ratio (OR) : 5. 2 : 1, 95 % CI: 1. 4 - 18. 9, P< 0. 01]. CONCLUSIONS: After 7 years in function, implants presented with deeper probing depths than <b>teeth.</b> <b>S.</b> aureus was commonly present at both teeth and implants sites. <b>S.</b> aureus at <b>tooth</b> sites was predictive of also being present at implant sites...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} reported that, before tooth eruption, over one-half of infants aged 6 mos were already infected with Streptococcus mutans. The {{aim of this}} investigation was to determine the colonization of <b>S.</b> mutans after <b>tooth</b> eruption in the same cohort of 111 infants (35 pre-term, 76 full-term). Our results showed that S. mutans colonization increased with increasing age, so that by 24 mos of age, 84 % harbored the bacteria (p 10 (5) CFU/mL (p < 0. 02). In contrast, non-colonization of S. mutans was associated with toothbrushing (p < 0. 03) and multiple courses of antibiotics (p < 0. 001). Analysis of our data establishes the timing of S. mutans colonization in children from birth to 24 mos of age...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluated}} microleakage {{associated with}} cast restorations that were luted with a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (RelyX) following obturation of the dentinal tubules {{with either a}} desensitizing agent (Gluma Desensitizer) or an adhesive system (Scotchbond Multipurpose Dental Adhesive). The effect of acid etching on {{the removal of the}} smear layer and its influence on the extent of microleakage associated with the adhesive system was also evaluated. Materials and Methods: Extracted mandibular premolars (N = 48) were prepared for complete cast restorations and divided into 4 groups (N = 12). In group A (control), neither a desensitizing agent or a component of the adhesive system was applied prior to luting. In group B, Gluma Desensitizer was used to obturate the dentinal tubules. In group C, Scotchbond Multipurpose Dental Adhesive System was applied to tooth preparations according to the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> instructions. <b>Tooth</b> preparations in group D received the same dentin surface treatment as in group C, but no acid etching was performed. Cast restorations in all 4 groups were then luted with the resin-modified glass ionomer luting cement RelyX. All specimens were subjected to thermocycling between 8 ° and 55 °C for 500 cycles in water baths, placed in a solution of 0. 5...|$|R
