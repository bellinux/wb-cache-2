Major elements include the Reed Solomon (RS) Frame, a Transmission Parameter Channel (TPC), and a <b>Fast</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Channel</b> (FIC).|$|E
5000|$|Transport Signaling System is {{the second}} layer, which uses the <b>Fast</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Channel</b> (FIC) in {{combination}} with the Service Signaling Channel (SSC). The main purpose of the FIC is to deliver essential information to allow rapid service acquisition by the receiver. The Service Signaling Channel (SSC), consists of several different signaling tables. The information carried within these tables can be compared to the PSIP information of ATSC. The SSC provides mainly the basic information, the logical structure of the transmitted services and the decoding parameters for video and audio.|$|E
50|$|The RS Frame is then {{partitioned}} {{into several}} segments {{of different sizes}} and assigned to specified regions. The M/H data in these regions are protected by an SCCC (Series Concatenated Convolutional Code), incorporating a code rate of 1/2 or 1/4, and is specific to each region in a group. A 1/4 rate PCCC (Parallel Concatenated Convolutional Code) is also employed as an inner code for the M/H signaling channel, which includes FIC (<b>Fast</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Channel)</b> and TPC (Transmission Parameter Channel). The TPC carries various FEC modes and M/H Frame information. Once the TPC is extracted, the receiver then knows the code rates being employed and can decode each region at its specified rate.|$|E
40|$|A {{microblog}} is {{a common}} concept in the new media framework. There is still no precise definition of the microblog or {{an answer to the}} question whether it is a variety of blog or a separate genre. Communication within micro-blogging is limited, which is why characteristic acronyms, language structures and vocabulary were developed. Websites like Twitter are used in politics, journalism and marketing. These websites are often a valuable source of <b>information</b> and the <b>fastest</b> <b>information</b> transmission <b>channel</b> for journalists. The microblog shares some features with the blog, but differences between them are visible: the microblog is not so thematically restricted, it has its own individual style and informative and communicative function, and it is more interactive and more frequently updated. According to such communication features, it is possible to define it as a new, separate internet genre...|$|R

The association between two categorical variables is analyzed. Values of the first variable represent <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> and values of second one represent different groups of people obtaining information through these <b>information</b> <b>channels.</b> The procedure of <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> effectiveness assessment for different groups of people is suggested.

40|$|This paper explores how {{informal}} <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> {{impact the}} investment performance of mutual funds. We measure {{the strengths of}} two specific <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> linked to the geographical location of fund managers: information transfers among managers (fund-fund links), and between fund managers and the companies in which they invest (fund-company links). We analyze the marginal impact of these <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> on abnormal returns generated from stock holdings. We find that each channel increases investment performance {{in the absence of}} the other. Investment performance is reduced when the two <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> act in combination, an effect that appears to be driven by “crowded trades” that reduce profitability. The stock selections that are associated with the presence of one <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> but the absence of the other earn positive future returns. Overall, our results show that the economic benefits of informal <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> depend critically on the nature of their interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} is to define practical profit which can be achieved using neural network methods as a prediction instrument. The thesis investigates the ability of neural networks to forecast future events. This capability is checked on the example of price prediction during intraday trading on stock market. The executed experiments show predictions of average 1, 2, 5 and 10 minutes’ prices based on data of one day and made by {{two different types of}} forecasting systems. These systems are based on the recurrent neural networks and back propagation neural nets. The precision of the predictions is controlled by the absolute error and the error of market direction. The economical effectiveness is estimated by a special trading system. In conclusion, the best structures of neural nets are tested with data of 31 days’ interval. The best results of the average percent of profit from one transaction (buying + selling) are 0. 06668654, 0. 188299453, 0. 349854787 and 0. 453178626, they were achieved for prediction periods 1, 2, 5 and 10 minutes. The investigation can be interesting for the investors who have access to a <b>fast</b> <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> with a possibility of every-minute data refreshment...|$|E
40|$|This study {{argues that}} since {{information}} search activities of online travel planners are outcome oriented, {{the selection of}} tourism online <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> is highly predictable. Building upon this assumption, {{this study examined the}} extent to which one could differentiate tourism online <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> through the online information search activities of online travel. The results of a series of logistic regression analyses of online American travelers confirm that there are significant and meaningful differences in the core functions of the various online <b>information</b> <b>channels.</b> The online travelers select different <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> based on different needs such as booking, generating ideas. Thus, {{the results of this study}} clearly suggest that tourism marketers can develop their competitive advantage by structuring their advertising program to match the information needs of those travelers based upon <b>information</b> <b>channel...</b>|$|R
40|$|High school pupils {{operate in}} a macro (country-specific), meso (school-specific) and micro (personal) context and their {{information}} needs are always experienced in a context - sometimes as imposed school assignments or else self-generated, e. g. as everyday life information needs. Pupils source their information through various <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> and there is sometimes a perceived risk to acting on incorrect information. Compared to adults in information-intensive professions, {{researchers have found that}} pupils tend to be unconcerned about the credibility of information. Based on a literature survey, a trust model was compiled from a number of other models and adapted to serve as an <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility model portraying the pupil in context with his/her perception of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility. The model was used as a framework for a study on high school pupils’ perceptions of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility and factors influencing their perceptions. The study was guided by the following research problem: How can school pupils’ perceptions of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility inform school-based interventions? In order to find answers, the following sub-questions were addressed: •	What has been reported on perceptions of information credibility and <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility, with specific reference to school pupils, students and adults, as well as professionals in information-intensive environments? •	How can trust models guide a study of pupils’ perceptions of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility? •	What factors influence school pupils’ perceptions of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility? •	What school-based interventions could be recommended to address the shortcomings in the perceptions of pupils that can prepare them to meet the information requirements of adulthood? A self-administered print questionnaire was used in May 2015 to survey the perceptions of 548 South African high school pupils from three different schools covering the range of the socio-economic spectrum from wealthy through to pupils from poor, unemployed home environments. The study was conducted with grade 8 and grade 12 pupils (entry and exit grades for South African high schools) from a city in the Mpumalanga province of South Africa. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the principals of the three schools. The results are reported as descriptive statistics supported with inferential statistics and qualitative analysis where relevant. The findings are that pupils’ perceptions of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility are affected by the perceived risk of acting on incorrect information, their previous experience and the context (i. e. type of information need, whether the need is imposed or self-generated and pupil demographics) in which the information need occurs. Pupils used a level of metacognition with regard to <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility. The model proved useful to guide data collection that can guide school-based interventions. It holds potential to be further adapted to actually reflect school-based interventions. School-based interventions are suggested to encourage responsible assessment of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility, including the simulation of risk by means of mark allocation for metacognition about <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> credibility, intentional exposure of pupils {{to a wide range of}} information needs and exposure to highly credible as well as less credible <b>information</b> <b>channels.</b> Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|A {{plethora of}} {{research}} studies {{has examined the}} effect of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> and <b>information</b> source on information search behavior respectively but scant research that examined them together is located. This study conducted a factorial repeated-measures ANOVA to examine the interaction effect between <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> and <b>information</b> source on students' internship information search behavior. Empirical findings indicated a significant interaction effect in students' information use. That is, how information is transmitted (<b>information</b> <b>channel)</b> is more influential than where information is from (information source) is in information use. Also, {{it was found that}} the selection of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> and source is dependent on the type of internship in query. Internal working environment was found most important and external working environment was least important information in internship selection. ? 2015 Cognizant Comm. Corp.

40|$|Micro-blogging {{websites}} (such as twitter), a new <b>information</b> <b>channel,</b> {{was widely}} reported as outperforming the mainstream <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> in numerous ways during the massive 2008 China earthquake, including beating {{the first official}} mainstream news released from the USGS to report the initial tremor (BBC May 12 2008). According to Twitter. com, there have been noticeable spikes of twitter usage during disasters and other large events, serving as an extremely powerful and effective fast response news service. This raises some important exploratory questions: What kind of information can micro-blogging provide regarding disaster news? Of what quality is the information provided by micro-blogging? Can the modern communication tool – micro-blogging, replace the mainstream media <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> or merely supplement it in distributing disaster news? How do twitter (and other micro-blogging services) compare with the mainstream <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> during the different timeframes in terms of information quality and collective intelligence? For this research paper, we will use Twitter {{as a proxy for}} micro-blogging in general, the mainstream media <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> as the benchmark, and the massive 2008 Sichuan earthquake as our research subject. At the time of the Sichuan earthquake, Twitter was universally available in the China mainland.
