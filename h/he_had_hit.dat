5|$|The {{following}} day, {{when the}} Indians {{took on the}} New York Yankees, Ramirez went 3 for 4 with his first two home runs, with many {{of his family and}} friends in attendance at Yankee Stadium. His first career home run was hit against Mélido Pérez. However, rather humorously, his first MLB hit off Perez was a ground rule double that bounced into the left field seats as left fielder Paul O'Neill pursued it. Ramirez, seeing the ball in the seats, continued running thinking <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> a home run, before returning to second base while his teammates ribbed him. After flying out to O'Neill in his next plate appearance, Ramirez homered in his final two at bats.|$|E
5|$|Garvey, Leonard, and Albert Pujols hit four {{home runs}} in their winning series—Garvey in his first win. Adam Kennedy won the 2002 ALCS MVP for hitting 3 {{home runs in}} 5 games; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> 7 {{during the regular season}} and hit 80 in his 14-year career. David Ortiz had 11 runs batted in (RBI) during the 2004 ALCS and Iván Rodríguez had 10 during the 2003 NLCS—the only two players to reach double-digit RBI in the series {{in the history of the}} award. From the pitcher's mound, Steve Avery threw 16 innings without giving up a run in the 1991 NLCS, and John Smoltz amassed 19 strikeouts the {{following}} year. Liván Hernández won the 1997 NLCS MVP after winning his only start and earning a win out of the bullpen in relief; he struck out 16 in 10 innings. Daniel Murphy won the 2015 NLCS MVP after hitting home runs in six consecutive games, setting a major league record.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, after a 21 at-bat hitless streak, Bonds hit 2 home runs, numbers 752 and 753, {{against the}} Chicago Cubs. He went 3–3 with 2 home runs, 6 RBIs, and {{a walk on}} that day. The {{struggling}} last place Giants still lost the game, 9–8. On July 27, Bonds hit home run 754 against Florida Marlins pitcher Rick VandenHurk. Bonds was then walked his next 4 at-bats in the game, but a 2-run shot helped the Giants win the game 12–10. It {{marked the first time}} since <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> #747 that Bonds had homered in a game the Giants won. On August 4, Bonds hit a 382foot(116m) home run against Clay Hensley of the San Diego Padres for home run number 755, tying Hank Aaron's all-time record. Bonds greeted his son, Nikolai, with an extended bear hug after crossing home plate. Bonds greeted his teammates and then his wife, Liz Watson, and daughter Aisha Lynn behind the backstop. Hensley was the 445th different pitcher to give up a home run to Bonds. Ironically, given the cloud of suspicion that surrounded Bonds, the tying home run was hit off a pitcher who had been suspended by baseball in 2005 for steroid use. He was walked in his next at bat and eventually scored on a fielder's choice.|$|E

25|$|However, Bond and Kyle Mills {{tied down}} the Zimbabwean batting effectively. After eight overs, Brendan Taylor and debutant Justice Chibhabha had both been caught by wicket-keeper McCullum, and {{the score was}} eight for 2. Sibanda played himself in, however, and looked to go on when he {{attempted}} a difficult second run and was run out for 21. The Zimbabwean batsmen just couldn't hit out at all, {{and by the end}} of the 35th over, they were 93 for 6 – having just seen Heath Streak out for 18, two balls after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> a thumping drive for six.|$|E

In his first innings Richardson too failed to score a run when was the victim of a poor umpiring decision. He was given out leg before wicket off the bowling of off-spinner Shivlal Yadav though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> the ball. He was more successful in the second innings, making 26 before he was bowled, and the match ended in a draw.|$|E

Innings of 79 and 42 against the touring Australian team underlined his status as one of the few batsmen to cope with the visitors' bowling spearhead, the highly regarded Ernie Jones; he concentrated on the leg-glance and cut shot, which the Australians were unable to counter through altered tactics.|$|E

25|$|David Andrew Warner {{was born}} at Paddington, a suburb in eastern Sydney, New South Wales. At the age of 13 he was asked by his coach to switch to {{right-handed}} batting because he kept hitting {{the ball in the}} air. However one season later his mother, Sheila Warner (née Orange), encouraged him to return to batting left-handed and he broke the U/16's run scoring record for the Sydney Coastal Cricket Club. He then made his first grade debut for the Eastern Suburbs club at the age of 15 and later toured Sri Lanka with the Australian under-19s and earned a rookie contract with the state team. He has been seen practising hitting right-handed in 2016, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> at least one switch-hit in all forms of the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year Walters became captain of Worcestershire, and he advanced steadily despite his team falling off and two very wet summers, scoring over 1,500 runs in 1932 including 190 against Warwickshire. However, {{it was not}} until 1933 that Walters entered the front rank of batsmen. Whereas <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> only one century in each of his first three seasons at Worcestershire, that year he hit a county-record nine centuries. With the Nawab of Pataudi, Maurice Nichol and Harold Gibbons Walters gave Worcestershire a quartet of batsmen who contributed twenty-five centuries between them. Although Worcestershire won only two games because of deplorable bowling, with Herbert Sutcliffe suffering a surprise decline, Walters was chosen to open the batting in all three Tests against the touring West Indians. With scores of 51 and 46 in the first two Tests he did not disappoint, and was named a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden for 1934. In the following series in India Walters definitely established himself as England's first choice opening bat, averaging 71 for six innings.|$|E
25|$|Lampard, for {{the second}} time in his career, hit four goals in one match against Aston Villa on 27 March 2010 to bring his goal tally past 20, for the fifth-consecutive season. This also brought him his 151st Chelsea goal, and it put him as the club's third highest scorer ever, {{overtaking}} Peter Osgood's record of 150. Lampard scored in a 3–0 win, again over Aston Villa, in the 2010 FA Cup semi-final. Lampard reached 20 Premier League goals for the first time when he scored twice against Stoke City in Chelsea's 7–0 win on 25 April 2010. This milestone also represented the first time <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> 25 in all competitions in a season. On 2 May, Lampard scored against Liverpool in the second last game of the season to give Chelsea a vital three points that took them to the top of the league by a single point. He scored one and assisted two other goals in the final match of the season where Chelsea thrashed Wigan Athletic 8–0 at Stamford Bridge to win the 2009–10 Premier League title and give him a remarkable 27 goals in the season.|$|E

25|$|Post tea-break, Sehwag and Dravid steadied the Indian innings {{further and}} carried forward to 278/1 along with Dravid, who, having come off 305 runs in Adelaide, {{had made a}} patient 49 from 89 balls with 5 boundaries. Steve Waugh gave himself an {{extended}} bowling spell, and against the run of play, produced a delivery which was well outside leg-stump, but Dravid aimed a shot to Damien Martyn at forward square leg, and it appeared that Dravid, who had faced a lot of short deliveries from Waugh, had not anticipated this delivery. Dravid's dismissal apparently did not hamper Sehwag's rapid progress, as he whipped a delivery to square-leg boundary with a flourish, off Brad Williams in the next over after the second wicket. However, Tendulkar was soon dismissed by Lee, trying to work a delivery in the legside fine. He was the third wicket to fall at 286/3. The Indian captain, Sourav Ganguly walked into the middle to join Sehwag, whose response to the two quick wickets was to just smash a MacGill delivery next over for a six above midwicket. However, Sehwag's approach hastened his end, as he {{was out in the}} 78th over, bowled by Simon Katich, the next ball after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> a six.|$|E
25|$|Born in Oldham, Lancashire, Maynard {{was brought}} up {{on the island of}} Anglesey in North Wales where he first joined Glamorgan. His career started in fine fashion when he hit a century on his debut in 1985, hitting three {{consecutive}} sixes to reach the 100 and he became the youngest-ever player to score 1,000 runs for the country in 1986. The 54 centuries he scored for Glamorgan during his playing career is also a record - the most any player has scored for the club. These displays of skill did not go unnoticed by the England selectors and he earned a call-up against the West Indies at the Oval in 1988. He was picked again in 1989 but then ran foul of the cricketing authorities by agreeing to go with Mike Gatting, on the controversial rebel tour of South Africa when that country had been banned from international sport because of its policy of apartheid. He later justified his decision by saying that he was desperate for a taste of international cricket having just been dropped from the England team. Nevertheless, his conduct led to a three-year Test ban, but he was eventually granted a recall for the Ashes series in 1993 after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> a century for Glamorgan against the Australians, but he failed to make much of an impact with the bat.|$|E
25|$|Ray Lindwall {{returned}} to Test bowling by dismissing Len Hutton {{with a beautiful}} swinging ball which moved from middle stump to flick {{the edge of his}} bat and was caught by Colin McCool at first slip. Bill Edrich joined Cyril Washbrook and together they took the score to 147/1 {{by the end of the}} second day, Edrich hit 10 fours in his 85 while Washbrook struck only 1 four in his 54. Resuming in the morning Lindwall (2/62) had Erich lbw for 89, much to his disappointment as like McCool he had been promised £1 a run if he made a century. Edrich had now made the highest score in the last three England innings (71, 119 and 89) and had returned the best figures in the last two Australian innings (3/79 and 3/50) and looked good for a big score. When he {{returned to}} the England dressing room he complained that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> the ball into his pads and should not have been out. This was overheard by an English pressman and was widely reported, becoming a major point of contention, especially as Denis Compton out lbw to Ernie Toshack when padding up of a ball that landed outside the stumps, causing the Middlesex player to stare at Umpire Scott in disbelief before his walked off. Wally Hammond came on and, annoyed at the two dismissals, gave a simple caught-and-bowled to Bruce Dooland, who then caught and bowled Cyril Washbrook for 62 and England had collapsed from 155/1 to 179/5. Jack Ikin (48) and Norman Yardley (61) dug in for two over hours and restored the innings with a stand of 113 until McCool (2/53) bowled the vice-captain and Dooland (4/69) removed Ikin and Voce with successive balls. With England 298/8 there was still a chance that they could overtake Australia for the first time in the series. Godfrey Evans made 17 and added 26 with Alec Bedser who swung the bat for 27 not out making 27 runs for the last wicket with Wright until the spinner was bowled by Johnson and England were out for 351, 14 runs behind.|$|E
