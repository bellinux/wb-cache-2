Arches National Park is {{so named because}} of over 2000 natural arches inside park boundaries. While the highway <b>does</b> <b>offer</b> views of several features in the park, there is no park access along the highway. Popular attractions along this portion include Negro Bill Canyon, with hiking trails to Morning Glory Arch, campgrounds and boat docks at a curve in the river called Big Bend.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the three television networks, C-SPAN also broadcasts via C-SPAN Radio, which is carried on their owned-and-operated station WCSP (90.1 FM) in the Washington, D.C. area with all three cable network feeds airing via HD Radio subchannels, and nationwide on XM Satellite Radio. Its programming is also livestreamed at c-span.org and is available via apps for iPhone, BlackBerry and Android devices. C-SPAN Radio has a selective policy regarding its broadcast content, rather than duplicating the television network programming, although it <b>does</b> <b>offer</b> some audio simulcasts of programs such as Washington Journal. Unique programming on the radio station includes oral histories, and some committee meetings and press conferences not shown on television due to programming commitments. The station also compiles the Sunday morning talk shows for a same-day rebroadcast without commercials, in rapid succession.|$|E
5|$|Jedi Knight is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, although it <b>does</b> <b>offer</b> {{the choice of a}} third-person view. The game consists of twenty-one levels with objectives which the player must complete before being able to continue to the next level. There are weapons available in each level and after level three, the player has the use of a lightsaber, along with the Force. In addition to being an effective weapon, the lightsaber is also a useful tool for the player, providing light in dark areas, deflecting incoming blaster fire and cutting through some obstacles.|$|E

5|$|While not portraying Akira sympathetically, {{the film}} <b>does</b> <b>offer</b> a socio-political {{view on the}} origins and inevitability of such {{criminal}} types in society. The tenements in which the youths reside are depicted as inhospitable and sterile. Lacking education, proper role models and moral codes, critic Bryan Hartzheim posited, crime and base pleasures are their most open recourse. They seem aware of the injustices in their environments and rail against society at large. However, Akira is illustrated as being capable of innocent pleasure, particularly in one fleeting scene in which he and his black friend Gil (Chico Rolands), whom he views as a fellow outcast, frolic in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register <b>does</b> <b>offer</b> a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E

25|$|The second possibility, fusing 32He {{with itself}} (32He + 32He), {{requires}} even higher temperatures (since now both reactants have a +2 charge), {{and thus is}} even more difficult than the D-3He reaction. However, it <b>does</b> <b>offer</b> a possible reaction that produces no neutrons; the charged protons produced can be contained using electric and magnetic fields, which in turn results in direct electricity generation. 32He + 32He fusion is feasible as demonstrated in the laboratory and has immense advantages, but commercial viability is {{many years in the}} future.|$|E

Its gentle curving slopes have much wildlife with Eurasian dotterel, ptarmigan, grouse and mountain hare seen on a regular basis. The hill's name translates from the Gaelic language as “Little Yellow Place” and is thought {{to refer to the}} coarse yellow grass which grows on its slopes. The “Little” part of the name is slightly confusing as the hill is the highest point on {{the southern part of the}} plateau but demonstrates that the hill was named from how it looked from the valley not by its altitude.|$|E
25|$|The temple {{ceremony}} involves {{entering into}} solemn covenants. Critics {{have expressed concern}} that a person may be denied access to the specific details of these covenants until that person is faced with making them in the temple, {{making it impossible to}} reflect on their meaning or ramifications. The LDS Church <b>does</b> <b>offer</b> a temple preparation seminar and freely publishes both the student booklet, Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple, and the teacher's manual, Endowed from on High: Temple Preparation Seminar, on its website. These books and the seminar which may be held are designed to help prepare members for the temple; attendance at the seminar is often required before a bishop will issue a temple recommend {{for the first time to}} a member. In the seminar, it is taught that all of the covenants entered into during the endowment have a basis in Latter-day Saint scripture; however, the specifics of the covenants are not revealed.|$|E

25|$|If Charlie {{is uncomfortable}} with Nancy and her desires, he has bigger {{problems}} with the lizards. At first, he insists {{that they are a}} death hallucination caused by rotten liver paste sandwiches. While the creatures intrigue Nancy, Charlie continually acts with fear and resistance. He follows his wife's lead on posing submissively when the creatures first approach, but he will not respond to them until she orders him to. Even after the ice has been broken, Charlie remains uncertain about the creatures and their intentions. Leslie and Sarah's ignorance on many things (emotions, anatomy, etc.) adds to Charlie's negative attitude. When he has to explain these ideas to them, he is easily frustrated and often condescending. He drives Leslie to beat and choke him. Yet at the end, Charlie agrees with Nancy that the lizards have to stay on land and not go back into the water. Though he helps because Nancy will do it whether or not he agrees, Charlie <b>does</b> <b>offer</b> to take them by the hand.|$|E
500|$|Bandslam was The Washington Post's critic choice, {{having a}} perfect score of 4/4 stars. Bandslam was somehow {{associated}} with High School Musical {{in a couple}} of reviews. However, the reviews concluded the comparisons positively, saying that Bandslam was [...] "actually a lot quirkier than the posters would have you believe." [...] New Jersey's local newspaper, The Star Ledger says that the plot is nicely skewed: [...] "Basically, it's the standard teen picture – girl torn between bad boy and nice guy – with a gender switch." [...] Michael Phillips of The Los Angeles Times praised the film by saying: [...] "Bandslam is a pretty good movie given that the odds of it having been a pretty bad movie were steep." [...] Critic Andy Webster of The New York Times said that Bandslam may not entirely break new teen-movie ground, but it <b>does</b> <b>offer</b> intriguing glimpses of performers ready to bolt from the Disney stable.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} on Justified, [...] "Señorita" [...] is a Spanish {{oriented}} song that features R influences; in it Timberlake sings {{about a girl}} with brown eyes. [...] "Like I Love You" [...] is a funk influenced song consisted of live drums, tiny guitar strum accompanied with the singer's breathy tenor. According to Ben Ratliff of Rolling Stone, [...] "it's minimalism influenced by Michael Jackson". The third track on the album, [...] "(Oh No) What You Got" [...] was described by Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine as a bit racy for the audience who expected a more boy-band-oriented record. Regarding the fourth song, Russell Bailie of The New Zealand Herald wrote that although the album [...] "manages to skirt teen-pop sugariness for the most part, though it <b>does</b> <b>offer</b> quality mush on numbers such as 'Take It From Here'." [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] is a funk and R song with an instrumentation that features beatboxing, synthesizers, Arabian-inspired riffs and Gregorian chants. Lyrically, the song is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past.|$|E

500|$|Invincible {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from mainstream critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received a mixed score of 51 based on 19 reviews. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine commented {{that it has}} a [...] "spark" [...] and [...] "sound better than anything Jackson has done since Dangerous." [...] Erlewine noted that while the album had good material it was [...] "not enough to make Invincible the comeback Jackson needed - he really would have had to have an album that sounded free instead of constrained for that to work - but it <b>does</b> <b>offer</b> a reminder that he can really craft good pop." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly, felt that Invincible is Jackson's [...] "first album since Off the Wall that offers virtually no new twists" [...] but remarked that the album [...] "feels like an anthology of his less-than-greatest hits". James Hunter of Rolling Stone critiqued that the album's later ballads made the record too long. Hunter also commented that Jackson and Riley made [...] "Whatever Happens" [...] "something really handsome and smart", allowing listeners [...] "to concentrate on the track's momentous rhythms" [...] such as [...] "Santana's passionate interjections and Lubbock's wonderfully arranged symphonic sweeps". Mark Beaumont of NME called it [...] "a relevant and rejuvenated comeback album made overlong", while Blender also found it [...] "long-winded".|$|E
500|$|The band {{released}} Deja Entendu through Razor & Tie/Triple Crown Records in June 2003, being {{issued in}} Europe and Australia in October 2003. The album's title, Deja Entendu, is French for [...] "already heard." [...] It was explained as [...] "very tongue-in-cheek" [...] by vocalist Jesse Lacey. Elaborating on the title's meaning, he told MTV, [...] "No {{matter who you}} are or what your band is about, you can't put a record out without people saying it's derivative of something else. So by saying the record's already been heard, it's kind of like saying, 'Yeah, you're right. We're doing something that's already been done before.'" [...] He reinforced, [...] "We're not trying to break new ground in music. We're {{just trying to make}} good music." [...] The album was described as a [...] "stylistic leap" [...] from Your Favorite Weapon, with a [...] "decidedly matured" [...] sound. In an interview with Billboard, Lacey said that although Deja Entendu <b>does</b> <b>offer</b> a different sound, the album [...] "doesn't seem like we're departing from anything, really. I think we always knew that {{we had a lot of}} potential and there's a lot of different stuff we were able to do, and a lot of different sounds we wanted to make. Not too long after we recorded the first record, we were already wondering where we were going to go from there." ...|$|E
500|$|Locke {{does not}} {{dedicate}} much space in Some Thoughts Concerning Education to outlining a specific curriculum; {{he is more}} concerned with convincing his readers that education is about instilling virtue and what Western educators would now call critical-thinking skills. Locke maintains that parents or teachers must first teach children how to learn and to enjoy learning. As he writes, the instructor [...] "should remember that his business is not so much to teach [...] all that is knowable, as to raise in him a love and esteem of knowledge; and to put him in the right way of knowing and improving himself." [...] But Locke <b>does</b> <b>offer</b> a few hints as to what he thinks a valuable curriculum might be. He deplores the long hours wasted on learning Latin and argues that children should first be taught to speak and write well in their native language, particularly recommending Aesop's Fables. [...] Most of Locke's recommendations are based on a similar principle of utility. So, for example, he claims that children should be taught to draw because {{it would be useful to}} them on their foreign travels (for recording the sites they visit), but poetry and music, he says, are a waste of time. Locke was also at the forefront of the scientific revolution and advocated the teaching of geography, astronomy, and anatomy. Locke's curricular recommendations reflect the break from scholastic humanism and the emergence of a new kind of education—one emphasising not only science but also practical professional training. Locke also recommended, for example, that every (male) child learn a trade. Locke's pedagogical suggestions marked the beginning of a new bourgeois ethos that would come to define Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.|$|E
