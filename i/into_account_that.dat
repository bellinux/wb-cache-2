5|$|Fast Five is {{the third}} highest-grossing film in the Fast and Furious {{franchise}} (behind Fast 6 and Furious 7), the sixteenth highest-grossing Universal film, the sixth highest-grossing 2011 film, the second highest-grossing heist/caper film, behind Inception, and the second highest-grossing car-racing film, behind Cars. According to Box Office Mojo, Fast Five {{is one of the}} most successful sequels of 2011, when taking <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> it is one of few to have outperformed the immediately-preceding instalment of its franchise in the US and Canada.|$|E
5|$|It must {{be taken}} <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> Soviet T-26 was one the most modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus {{is one of}} {{relatively}} few sauropods for which gastroliths were found obviously alongside the type specimen. In 2007, an experiment using Dinheirosaurus, Diplodocus (=Seismosaurus), and Cedarosaurus tested if sauropods used their gastroliths in an avian-style gastric mill. The analysis took <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> {{among the hundreds of}} sauropods found, gastroliths are only known from a few associated specimens. Authors chose to use the three sauropods with the most associated gastroliths, Dinheirosaurus, Diplodocus, and Cedarosaurus, because of the large amount of gastroliths found in birds. When birds were typically found to have 1.05% of their body weight gastroliths, the sauropod Diplodocus, which had the highest amount of gastroliths, only amassed to 0.03% body weight. This means that since the other sauropods Dinheirosaurus and Cedarosaurus had less gastroliths to body mass, an avian-style gastric mill is unlikely to have evolved in sauropods, and they instead might have used gastroliths to absorb minerals.|$|E

5|$|France competes {{annually}} in the Six Nations Championship, which is played against five other European nations: England, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. France first contested the tournament in 1910 when the Home Nations became the Five Nations. France were expelled from the tournament due to rumours of professionalism in the then-amateur sport in 1932, but rejoined in 1947. They first won the competition in 1954, sharing the championship with both England and Wales. France shared with Wales again the following season, and won it outright {{for the first time}} in 1959. France's longest wait for a championship spanned 37 tournaments (1910–1954). The Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy is also contested between France and Italy during the Six Nations. Over the whole history of the Tournament, they are the third most-winning nation, ten wins behind England. However, it should be taken <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> France have been present in 33 fewer tournaments than the Home Nations. France has won almost exactly the same proportion of Six Nations Tournaments in which it has competed as England, and is the most successful nation in the post-World War II era (1945–present).|$|E

25|$|Regression is also similar, but {{it takes}} <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> the data is imprecise.

25|$|In the U.S. of the 1930s, one farmer fed only {{himself and}} three other consumers. The same farmer now feeds well over a hundred people.

25|$|Decompression {{procedures}} {{may take}} <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> the cave diver usually follows a very rigidly constrained and precisely defined route, both {{into and out}} of the cave, and can reasonably expect to find any equipment such as drop cylinders temporarily stored along the guideline while making the exit. In some caves, changes of depth of the cave along the dive route will constrain decompression depths, and gas mixtures and decompression schedules can be tailored to take this into account.|$|E

25|$|The reason: {{under the}} {{original}} flight plan, when Huygens was to descend to Titan, {{it would have}} accelerated relative to Cassini, causing the Doppler shift of its signal to vary.

However, the firmware failed to take <b>into</b> <b>account</b> <b>that</b> the Doppler shift would have changed not only the carrier frequency, but also the timing of the payload bits, coded by phase-shift keying at 8192 bits per second.|$|E
