The mechanism is then studied in an auction-theoretic setting with privately known declining marginal valuations. An equilibrium exists even when bids are costless and the allotment is pre-announced. In this equilibrium, the extent of strate- gic overbidding is limited, {{and there is a}} bound below which the allotment quota never falls.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} the optimal bidding behaviour of a single bank in the context of <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> liquidity <b>tenders.</b> Banks’ bidding is shown to depend crucially on the central bank’s liquidity policy as regards tender allotments. The paper also analyses ECB liquidity policy in terms of the model. The ECB, while applying <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tenders,</b> appears to have been attempting stabilise the market interest rate at a level close to the main refinancing rate. However, this aim was at least partially overridden by that of stabilising total money market liquidity {{over the course of the}} reserve maintenance period – even more so when banks were expecting the ECB to raise the main refinancing rate in the near future. The banks’ aggregate bids increased considerably during the period of <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tenders.</b> This was seen to result mainly from profit opportunities associated with a positive spread between market interest rate and main refinancing rate. The positive spread resulted from the combination of expectations of an interest rate hike and liquidity-oriented allotment policy. bidding; money market tenders; liquidity policy; central bank operating framework...|$|R

This fact stands in a somewhat puzzling contrast to the prevalent view in the theoretical literature that the procedure, by fixing interest rate and quantity at the same time, does not allow a strategic equilibrium. We show that an equilibrium exists under general conditions even if bidders expect true demand to exceed supply on average. The outcome is typically inefficient. It is argued that the <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tender,</b> in comparison to other tender formats, may be an appropriate instrument for central bank liquidity management when market conditions are sufficiently calm.

This note presents some elements of a theory of bidding in central bank tenders in a framework such as the one of the Eurosystem, i. e. with high reserve requirements and averaging and possible expectations of rate changes within the reserve maintenance period in which a tender is executed. The ECB has so far used fixed rate tenders and a variant of the variable rate tender, which may be similar to a <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tender</b> depending on market circumstances. In doing so, it faced consecutively an “under- “ and an “overbidding ” issue.

The results of the model suggest that the discretionary <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tender</b> procedure performs well under conditions of stable interest rates, but may have some disadvantages in case of strong rate change expectations. The variable rate tender performs, in terms of the aspects analyzed here, well under all cases of rate expectations.

40|$|Most OECD {{central banks}} {{implement}} monetary policy by supplying reserves to the banking sector {{with the aim}} of influencing short-term interbank interest rates. To interpret the monetary policy stance accurately, one needs to be familiar with the mechanism for determining the money market equilibrium. The aim {{of this study is to}} deepen our understanding of the various effects of different intervention styles on the short-term money market when monetary policy is implemented with an operational framework similar to that of the European Central Bank (ECB). In the first essay of this study, we model banks' demand for central bank reserves (liquidity) for each day of an n-day reserve maintenance period and analyse liquidity determination under alternative liquidity policy rules that a central bank might apply in <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tenders.</b> It is shown that there is a tradeoff between the central bank's ability to keep a market interest rate close to the <b>tender</b> <b>rate</b> and the stability of liquidity holdings within a maintenance period. The second essay presents a model of a single bank's optimal bidding in the context of <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> liquidity <b>tenders.</b> It is shown that banks' bidding crucially depends on the central bank's liquidity policy for tender allotments. This essay also analyses ECB liquidity policy in terms of the model.

40|$|The <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tender</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{procedures}} used by central banks in the implementation of their monetary policies. While academic research has largely dismissed the procedure owing to its tendency to encourage overbidding, central banks such as the ECB and the Bank of England have continued using it. We investigate this apparent conflict by considering an auction-theoretic setting with private information about declining marginal valuations. Since overbidding entails exposure risk, an equilibrium may exist even if bids are costless and the intended volume is pre-announced. In fact, the allotment quota may be strictly below one with certainty. Also with adaptive expectations, overbidding need not escalate. However, the resulting allocation is typically ineffi cient. Empirical proxies of exposure risk are significant in both euro and sterling operations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive model on the spread between the euro overnight {{rate and the}} key policy rate of the ECB. It is shown {{that the most important}} variables driving the level and the volatility of this spread are expectations about changes of the key policy rate and the projected liquidity conditions {{at the end of the}} reserve maintenance period. The model allows for an assessment of how these variables impact differently on the spread according to the different open market operating procedures and the liquidity management policy of the ECB. It is found that a <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tender</b> procedure effectively limits the downward potential of the spread, while, however, no evidence is identified that it should be more effective than a variable rate tender procedure in keeping overall the overnight rate close to the key policy rate.

We analyze the banks' bidding behavior {{and identify the}} determinants for the decision to participate {{as well as on}} the amount to tender. Therefore, we estimate bidding functions for banks which participate regularly in the SNB's auctions. We find that a bank's bids from the previous day and the amount of maturing repo operations with the SNB have for most banks a significant effect. The autonomous factors (government balances at the SNB and currency in circulation) are of only minor importance. A further determinant of the bidding behavior is the attractiveness of the SNB's auction rate compared to the prevailing interbank market repo rate. The spread of unsecured and repo rates as well as the attractiveness of funding Euros indirectly via a Swiss franc repo transaction with the SNB are only for few banks significant. Further, the question is addressed whether the bidding behavior changed in the financial market crisis of 2007 / 2008. There is little evidence of a systematic change in bidding behavior in the crisis. This results from the fact that the SNB has addressed the volatile demand for reserves in the crisis with overnight fine-tuning operations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{general equilibrium model}} of the determination of equilibrium in the interbank market for overnight liquidity when the central bank uses <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>tenders</b> in its liquidity provision. We consider three alternative liquidity policy rules. First, the central bank may provide the bid amounts in full. Alternatively, the central bank can scale back the bid amounts pro rata with the individual bids. For the latter case, we consider two target options for the central bank: liquidity or an interest rate. We show that the expected overnight rate remains more tightly {{in the hands of}} the central bank if the full allotment procedure or a pure interest rate targeting rule is used than if liquidity targeting is used. We will also demonstrate how optimal bidding in tender operations varies considerably according to which procedure is chosen by the central bank. money market tenders; overnight rate of interest; averaging; central bank operational framework...|$|R
40|$|In the Eurosystem, banks’ {{interest}} rate expectations {{should no longer}} {{have resulted in a}} non-zero tender spread, the difference between marginal and minimum price for liquidity, when the ECB reformed its op-erational framework for monetary policy implementation in March 2004 so that the policy rates remain constant within reserves maintenance periods. Yet, the tender spread was wider in 2005 than in any single year after 2000, when the ECB switched from <b>fixed</b> to variable <b>rate</b> <b>tenders.</b> Parts of the relevant literature have argued that because of the ECB’s asymmetric preferences over deviations of the market rates up and down from the policy rate, the shortest euro {{interest rate}}s persistently exceed the policy rate This paper argues, however, that when the central bank applies a quantity oriented liquidity policy, a positive tender spread may result from money market inefficiencies and banks’ risk aversion even if the central bank preferences are symmetric and the markets do not anticipate any changes in the policy rates. In such a case, {{the driving force behind the}} tender spread is banks’ uncertainty about their individual allotments at the marginal rate for the Eurosystem main refinancing operations (MROs). Furthermore, the allotment uncertainty is shown to be significantly related to the amount of liquidity supplied in each operation. Hence, the expansion in the MRO volumes experienced since 2002 may have had a major contribution to the emergence and observed growth of the tender spread. main refinancing operations; liquidity; tender spread; allotments...|$|R
