25|$|As {{the convoy}} reached the deeply forested area of Dharba valley on Jagdalpur-Sukma Highway, 50km from its destination, it {{was blocked by}} trees that had been felled by Maoists. The Maoists {{triggered}} an IED near the fourth vehicle in the convoy, completely damaging the vehicle and leaving a five-meter crater in the ground. In an attempt to flee, several vehicles collided with each other. The blast {{was carried out by}} a bomb using 27–30kg of explosive using ammonium nitrate and <b>electric</b> <b>detonators</b> with command wire were used to trigger the blast.

500|$|To {{handle the}} {{logistics}} of the tests, Luis Alvarez was appointed by Robert Oppenheimer, {{the director of the}} Los Alamos laboratory, {{as the head of the}} RaLa program; his group was designated E-7, RaLa and <b>Electric</b> <b>Detonators</b> Group. [...] Bruno Rossi and Swiss physicist Hans Staub built the ionization chambers and electronics by late spring. At first the work proceeded at a leisurely pace as the implosion was only a backup project; it was believed that the plutonium bomb would be of the Thin Man gun-type nuclear weapon design. This turned out not to be the case, as the first tests on reactor-produced plutonium in early summer 1944 showed unacceptably high spontaneous fission rates due to the presence of plutonium-240, precluding the use of gun assembly. On 17 July the Thin Man design was abandoned, and all effort was focused on implosion. To meet the challenge, the Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized—the X-Division (Explosive Division) and the G-Division (Gadget Division, or Weapon Physics Division) were formed. Rossi's group was assigned to G-Division as G-6, or RaLa Group; Alvarez's group was G-7, or Electric Detonator Group.|$|E

50|$|The MAPED F1 uses a {{very complex}} {{electric}} firing system. It is basically actuated by a contact wire. The battery pack and firing cable are attached to an <b>electric</b> <b>detonator</b> which is inserted in the mine and a spool of contact wire is rolled out. Any contact with the wire after the mine is armed will break the fibre, which collapses an electrical circuit and triggers the mine.|$|R
50|$|EBWs {{have found}} uses outside nuclear weapons, {{such as the}} Titan IV, safety {{conscious}} applications where stray electrical currents might detonate normal blasting caps, and applications requiring very precise timing for multiple point commercial blasting in mines or quarries. EBW detonators are much safer than regular <b>electric</b> <b>detonators</b> because unlike regular detonators EBWs do not have primary explosives. Primary explosives such as lead azide {{are very sensitive to}} static electricity, radio frequency, shock etc.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to firing very quickly when properly activated, EBW detonators are safe from stray static electricity and other electric current. Enough current and the bridgewire may melt, {{but it is}} small enough that it cannot detonate the initiator explosive unless the full, high voltage high current charge passes through the bridgewire. EBW detonators are used in many civilian applications where radio signals, static electricity, or other electrical hazards might cause accidents with conventional <b>electric</b> <b>detonators.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A non {{electric}} detonator is a shock tube detonator designed to initiate explosions, generally {{for the purpose}} of demolition of buildings and for use in the blasting of rock in mines and quarries. Instead of electric wires, a hollow plastic tube delivers the firing impulse to the detonator, making it immune to most of the hazards associated with stray electric current. It consists of a small diameter, three-layer plastic tube coated on the innermost wall with a reactive explosive compound, which, when ignited, propagates a low energy signal, similar to a dust explosion. The reaction travels at approximately 6,500 ft/s (2,000 m/s) {{along the length of the}} tubing with minimal disturbance outside of the tube. The design of Non <b>electric</b> <b>detonators</b> incorporates patented technology, including the Cushion Disk (CD) and Delay Ignition Buffer (DIB) to provide reliability and accuracy in all blasting applications. Non <b>electric</b> <b>detonators</b> was invented by the Swedish company Nitro Nobel in the 1960s and 1970s, under the leadership of Per-Anders Persson, and launched to the demolitions market in 1973. (Nitro Nobel became a part of Dyno Nobel after being sold to Norwegian Dyno Industrier AS in 1986.) Nonel is a contraction of [...] "Non {{electric detonator}}s".|$|E

5000|$|The MRUD {{is usually}} command {{actuated}} by <b>electric</b> <b>detonator,</b> {{but it can}} also be set up for tripwire actuation. In Bosnia and Croatia it was combined with a PMA-2 blast type anti-personnel mine by inserting one end of a length of detonating cord in the detonator cavity of the MRUD and taping the other end of the detonating cord to the bottom of the PMA-2. When the blast mine actuated, the MRUD was actuated as well.|$|R
5000|$|The mine {{contains}} 2 kg {{of explosive}} to propel 450 steel rod fragments to a lethal range of 100 m, at maximum range {{the spread of}} the fragmentation is 9.5 m. The mine alone weighs 5 kg but with the shackle and mounting spike the weight is 7.53 kg. The MON 100 can be command actuated using a PN manual inductor attached by demolition cable to an EDP-R <b>electric</b> <b>detonator.</b> It can also be actuated by a variety of booby trap (BT) switches including: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} product is 3 mm outer {{diameter}} and 1 mm inner diameter, {{with a tiny}} dusting of HMX/aluminum explosive powder on the tubing's inner surface, which detonates down the tube at a speed greater than 6500 feet per second but does not burst the tube. Being non-electrical and non-metallic, shock tubes are less sensitive to static electricity and radio frequency energy and thus have replaced many uses of <b>electric</b> <b>detonators</b> and are safer to handle and store than detonating cord. A version containing an explosive gas mixture has the additional advantage of being entirely inert until the tubing is charged with the gas.|$|E

50|$|The mine has {{a central}} tube in the bottom, which can either accept an <b>electric</b> command <b>detonator</b> or a wire, which is {{attached}} to the pressure plunger. The wire can anchored, allowing it to act as an anti-handling device.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{thin-walled}} shell axial impact {{deformation of}} one-leg <b>electric</b> <b>detonator</b> with different density charge was studied. The impact stress was analyzed, {{and on the}} basis of kinetic theory the impact deformation model was established for the thin-walled shell filled with explosive. The experiments were verified at 60 000 g, 80 000 g, 100 000 g and 120 000 g by gas gun. The results show that shell length decreases and the plastic deformation zone diameter increases after impact. Damage deformation degree decreases with increased shell strength, reduced shell and internal charging mass summation and reduced impact velocity square. The model calculated value agrees well with the test data. The deformation model can be used to predict overload damage deformation for such detonator...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{developed}} a flame-radiation-powered trigger device to explosively activate suppression barriers to quench gas and coal dust explosions. The major component of the device is a silicon solar panel, which converts radiation from the developing explosion into electrical energy to initiate an <b>electric</b> <b>detonator,</b> which releases an extinguishing agent into the advancing flame front. Solar panels that are rated to produce 20 W of electrical power when exposed to the sunlight are producing about 200 W when exposed to a full-scale dust explosion. The solar panel is electrically isolated from the detonator by a pressure-sensitive switch until {{the arrival of the}} precursor pressure pulse, which always precedes a deflagration. This combination of pressure arming and flame-powered photogenerator prevents false barrier activation and requires no external power supply...|$|R
