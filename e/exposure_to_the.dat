5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed young adults. In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in young adults 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the immunocompromised.

40|$|First {{published}} as an Advance Article {{on the web}} 11 th March 2004 Occupational exposure is the condition of being subjected through employment to a chemical, physical, or biological agent, or to a specific process, practice, behavior, or organization of work. <b>Exposure</b> <b>to</b> a chemical agent is typically the contact of that agent with the outer boundary of a subject, such as the respiratory system, skin, or digestive system. In occupational hygiene we are most concerned with exposure through the respiratory system, although, increasingly we {{are concerned with the}} results of dermal exposures, including those <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skin that can be transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mouth and digestive system. This presentation will detail methods available for assessing personal <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> chemicals through monitoring.

5|$|Chlorine is {{detectable}} with {{measuring devices}} in concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60ppm. About 1000ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gas can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).|$|E

5|$|Following initial {{interest}} in brachytherapy in Europe and the US, its use {{declined in the}} middle of the twentieth century due to the problem of radiation exposure to operators from the manual application of the radioactive sources.

This, together with more recent advancements in three-dimensional imaging modalities, computerised treatment planning systems and delivery equipment has made brachytherapy a safe and effective treatment for many types of cancer today.|$|E

30|$|We {{analyze the}} {{question}} if the cross-sectional dispersion in average German stock market returns is due <b>to</b> characteristics or <b>the</b> <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{risk factors of}} the FFC-model. The persistent performance advantage of some “weak” firm characteristic stocks compared to some “strong” firm characteristic stocks can either arise because they are riskier or because the differences in performance are due to mispricing (Daniel and Titman 1998 : 24, 25). We find that neither there is a size effect nor that SMB is a priced risk factor. Our results indicate that HML and WML are not priced and that stock returns are related to characteristics rather than <b>to</b> <b>exposures.</b> These findings are robust <b>to</b> choices of <b>the</b> methodology.
