40|$|The doppler {{measurements}} of stars are diluted and distorted by stellar activity noise. Different choices of noise models and statistical methods {{have led to}} much controversy in the confirmation of exoplanet candidates obtained through analysing radial velocity data. To quantify the limitation of various models and methods, we compare different noise models and signal detection criteria for various simulated and real data sets in the Bayesian framework. According to our analyses, the white noise model tend to interpret noise as signal, leading to false positives. On the other hand, the red noise models are likely to interprete signal as noise, resulting in false negatives. We find that the Bayesian information criterion combined with a Bayes factor threshold of 150 can efficiently rule out false positives and confirm true detections. We further propose a Goldilocks principle aimed at modeling radial velocity noise to avoid too many false positives and too many false negatives. We propose that the noise model with RHK-dependent jitter is used {{in combination with the}} moving average model to detect planetary signals <b>for</b> <b>M</b> dwarfs. Our <b>work</b> may also shed light on the noise modeling for hotter stars, and provide a valid approach for finding similar principles in other disciplines.

This Review summarizes some of the latest developments, particularly in metallic and plasmonic lasers, improvements in small dielectric lasers, and the emerging area of small bio-compatible or bio-derived lasers. We examine the different approaches employed to reduce size and how they result in significant differences in the final device, particularly between metal- and dielectric-cavity lasers.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{the identification of}} inhibitors of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific gap ligase chain reaction (LCR) DNA amplification assay {{as well as a}} method for their removal. A major contributor to inhibition was deduced to be a calcium phosphate precipitate, CaHPO 4. The precipitate forms during N-acetyl-l-cysteine–sodium hydroxide (NALC-NaOH) decontamination, digestion, and concentration of respiratory specimens. The solubility product of CaHPO 4 precipitate at pH 7. 8, the pH at which gap LCR is optimized, indicates that the precipitate releases an amount of phosphate ions sufficient to inhibit amplification. A method for removal of the precipitate was identified. The precipitate is dissociated by exposing it to a mildly acidic (pH 4. 1) buffer during the first of two centrifugation steps; the inhibitory phosphate ions are removed by the centrifugation steps. When 100 NALC-NaOH respiratory sediments were tested by gap LCR, none of the sediments were inhibitory when the acidic buffer was used while 24 samples were inhibitory when TE buffer, pH 7. 8, was used. In another study, when the acidic buffer wash was applied to 1, 440 NALC-NaOH respiratory sediments, only 10 sediments were found to be inhibitory.

The multifractal dimensions, Dq, are measured from the log-log plots of Cq(r) versus r and Cq(t) versus t, where Cq(r) and Cq(t) are the generalized correlation integrals for the epicentral distribution and time sequence of events, respectively. r and t are the epicentral distance and inter-event time, respectively, at positive q. The log-log plot of Cq(r) versus r shows a linear por­tion when log(rl) ≤ log(r) ≤ log(ru). The rl and ru values are, respectively, 120 and 560 km <b>for</b> <b>M</b> ≥ 6 events, 100 and 560 km <b>for</b> <b>M</b> ≥ 6. 5 events, and 63 and 560 km <b>for</b> <b>M</b> ≥ 7 events.
