40|$|The {{point of}} the project is {{to look into the}} {{possible}} causes and possible solutions for the Two Way Automatic Communication System (TWACS) that are currently being used by Idaho Power. The TWACS is used to read the power meters with a communication device instead of sending meter readers The TWACS can cause undesired voltage sags at some households utilizing this system. The goal is to filter out these sags without altering the peaks in the current waveform. Examples of problems that are caused by the TWACS include problems with UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply), flickering of lights on <b>dimmer</b> <b>switches,</b> clocks running fast, and transient pulses measured on the neutral to earth system during data transmission. The research that we are doing is focused on pointing out the cause of the problems that are caused by TWACS and to design a possible solution to fix the voltage sags in the waveform.

40|$|Solid state {{lighting}} (SSL), specifically {{light-emitting diodes}} (LED), has been advancing {{at a rapid}} pace, and there are presently multiple products available that serve as direct replacements for traditional luminaires. In this demonstration, conventional recessed lights {{in a conference room}} were used to compare conventional incandescent A-lamps, incandescent reflector R-lamps, dimming compact fluorescent lamps (CFL), to an LED replacement product. The primary focus during the study was on light delivered to the task plane as provided by the power required by the lighting system. Vertical illuminance, dimming range, and color shift are also important indicators of lighting quality and are discussed in the report. The results clearly showed that LEDs, with dimming-capable drivers, are much more efficient than incandescent and CFLs. Further, LEDs provide much smoother and consistent dimming than dimmable CFLs. On the potential negative side, {{it is important that the}} dimming switch be identified as compatible with the LED driver. A wide variety of <b>dimmer</b> <b>switches</b> are capable of dimming LEDs down to 15 % of full light output, while select others can be capable of dimming LEDs down to 5 %.

40|$|MicroRNAs are nature’s <b>dimmer</b> <b>switches</b> for protein translation. When {{expressed}} in sufficient abundance, these single-stranded small RNAs bind to comple-mentary nucleotide sequences in the 3 ' untranslated regions of target mRNAs and direct them to RNA-induced silenc-ing complexes (RISCs) for translational suppression and degradation. 1 Although {{much has been}} learned about the molecu-lar mechanisms of microRNA activity, understanding their system-wide effects has lagged. Thus, striking end-organ phe-notypes provoked by artificial manipula-tion and/or natural regulation of a given microRNA are not readily explained by modest in vivo suppression (typically 30 – 50 %) of direct mRNA targets. 2 Our laboratory has gained insight into this issue using whole-genome microRNA, mRNA and RISC sequencing to examine the global consequences of microRNA-mRNA interactions in a model of stress-adaptation, the early cardiac response to pressure overload: 3 Deep sequencing iden-tified approximately 370 cardiac-expressed microRNAs and approximately 8, 500 cardiac-expressed mRNAs. Although bio-informatics has indicated that one-third of all mRNAs are potential microRNA targets, 4 deep sequencing of mRNAs cap-tured within microRNA RISC complexes (RISC-Seq) 5 revealed that only ~ 1, 200 of the 8, 500 cardiac-expressed mRNAs (e. g., ~ 15 %) were being directly targeted by car-diac microRNAs. Likewise, in our studies the steady-state abundance of> 600 car-diac microRNAs was significantly altered by acute hemodynamic stress, but only 63 (~ 10 %) of these appeared to be directly targeted and regulated by microRNAs. 3 Given the modest effects of microRNAs on suppression of their direct mRNA tar-gets and {{the limited number of}} mRNAs that are directly targeted by microRNAs MicroRNAs and the butterfly effect Gerald W. dorn ii...|$|E

2500|$|... "Dipping" [...] (low beam) {{headlamps}} {{were introduced}} in 1915 by the Guide Lamp Company, but the 1917 Cadillac system allowed the light to be dipped with a lever inside the car rather than requiring the driver to stop and get out. The 1924 Bilux bulb was the first modern unit, having the light for both low (dipped) and high (main) beams of a headlamp emitting from a single bulb. A similar design was introduced in 1925 by Guide Lamp called the [...] "Duplo". In 1927, the foot-operated <b>dimmer</b> <b>switch</b> or dip switch was introduced and became standard {{for much of the}} century. 1933–34 Packards were equipped with tri-beam headlamps, the bulbs having three filaments. From highest to lowest, the beams were called [...] "country passing", [...] "country driving" [...] and [...] "city driving". The 1934 Nash also used a three-beam system, although in this case, the bulbs were conventional two-filament type, and the intermediate beam combined low beam on the driver's side with high beam on the passenger's side, so as to maximise the view of the roadside while minimizing glare toward oncoming traffic. The last vehicle with a foot-operated <b>dimmer</b> <b>switch</b> were the 1991 Ford F-Series and E-Series [...] vans.
