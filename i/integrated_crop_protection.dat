40|$|Plant {{protection}} {{is one of}} the major issues in organic farming. Organic <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> (OCP) strategies often rely on a limited number of methods that provide only partial control of pests and that induce lower yields and economic performances. As a result, farmers hesitate to adopt these strategies and doubts are cast on the ability of organic agriculture to feed the world. This chapter questions how agroecological concepts may contribute to OCP, while taking the different alternative schemes already developed to manage, <b>integrate</b> and design <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> strategies into account. As demonstrated by a bibliographic analysis, Integrated pest management (IPM) remains the leading paradigm in <b>crop</b> <b>protection.</b> It also provides its foundational basis, giving priority to bioecological processes and alternative techniques to reduce pesticide use. Beyond IPM, agroecology is characterised by a holistic approach and the importance given to the design of a "healthy" agroecosystem. In practice, all these concepts are subject to various interpretations, and organic farming includes a variety of practices, ranging from intensive input-substitution to a comprehensive integrated approach. This paper provides key elements for <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> in OF on the basis of the adaptation of the agroecological <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> approach. Based on a successful case study of fruit fly management in OF in Reunion Island (France), we highlight three major pillars to design pest management strategies: sanitation, habitat manipulation and conservation biological control. Finally, in the field of <b>crop</b> <b>protection,</b> this paper shows that organic farming can be both a prototype for designing innovations and a source of practices to be extended to other types of agroecosystems.

40|$|A fully {{revised and}} updated {{training}} manual on responsible and need-based pesticide use, Agro-pesticides :properties and functions in <b>integrated</b> <b>crop</b> <b>protection,</b> {{has been published}} by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). The first edition, published in 1982 under the title Agro-pesticides: their management and application, grew out of experience gained m a regional series of training courses on the safe handling and proper use of pesticides. The different title of the new edition reflects {{the realization that the}} original concept of chemical protection was flawed. Over-use of pesticides has unacceptably affected human lives and causes considerable environmental pollution as well as enormous financial waste which no country can afford. It has also resulted in an alarming level of resistance in many pest and disease organisms, not to mention the destruction of natural enemies which, most of the time, are capable of keeping crop damage at an acceptably low level. This manual acknowledges the need to use pesticides in many instances but emphasizes restraint through safe and responsible application. Consequently it aims to provide the student with a comprehensive introduction to the characteristics of the various groups of pest organisms and the functions of pesticide use in their integrated control. It provides up-to-date information on properties of modern pesticides, their hazards and safe management in integrated crop production and explains principles of application equipment and techniques suited for small-scale farming. Finally, the manual reflects changes in policy approaches of national governments and international organizations.

40|$|In the Netherlands {{every year}} flower bulbs and {{perennials}} are produced representing {{a value of}} € 500 m (flower bulbs) and of € 65 m (perennials, 2004). The growers are faced with several threatening pests and diseases during the production. They usually deal with these problems by using pesticides. In 2004 the Ministry of Agriculture and the stakeholders in Agribusiness made an agreement on reducing {{the environmental impact of}} pesticides by developing and implementing knowledge on <b>Integrated</b> <b>Crop</b> <b>Protection.</b> As a result growers were expected to control pest and disease problems using effective and sustainable solutions. Sustainable control methods have been developed to control the plural problems the growers encounter during the production and postharvest phase of flower bulbs and perennials. These methods include using clean plant material, decision support systems, pesticides with a low environmental risk, biocontrol agents, natural enemies, pesticide emission reducing techniques, methods for manipulating soil health, etc. These methods were tested not only under experimental conditions at the Applied Plant Research Centre (PPO) Lisse but also under practical conditions at farmers.

To meet these objectives, the DFPV runs courses to train high level <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> technicians and trainers from agricultural schools in the CILSS Member States. Other courses include in-country training (based on the particular needs of specific countries); training for highly qualified individuals or groups; training workshops; and refresher courses. The DFPV also carries out research designed to support the training programmes by developing further skills and knowledge in subject areas related to <b>crop</b> <b>protection.</b> The research also produces educational and instructional training materials, and generates practical and simple results that farmers can use. Emphasis is put on multidisciplinary research in order to promote an <b>integrated</b> approach to <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> at farm level. The project collaborates with national services and international institutions such as the National Agricultural Research Institute, the <b>Crop</b> <b>Protection</b> Directorate of Niger, the University of Niamey (Niger), ICRISAT, IITA, PRIFAS and ORSTOM. The information component of DFPV has now been integrated with the documentation centre of Agrhymet. It disseminates scientific and technical information on <b>crop</b> <b>protection,</b> and carries out bibliographic searches free-of-charge.

40|$|Organic {{chemistry}} has been, and for {{the foreseeable}} future will remain, vitally important for <b>crop</b> <b>protection.</b> Control of fungal pathogens, insect pests and weeds is crucial to enhanced food provision. As world population continues to grow, it is timely to assess the current situation, anticipate future challenges and consider how new chemistry may help meet those challenges. In future, agriculture will increasingly be expected to provide not only food and feed, but also crops for conversion into renewable fuels and chemical feedstocks. This will further increase the demand for higher crop yields per unit area, requiring chemicals used in crop production to be even more sophisticated. In order to contribute to programmes of <b>integrated</b> <b>crop</b> management, there is a requirement for chemicals to display high specificity, demonstrate benign environmental and toxicological profiles, and be biodegradable. It will also be necessary to improve production of those chemicals, because waste generated by the production process mitigates the overall benefit.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the extent to which systems approaches to innovation are reflected in the <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> literature and how such approaches are used. A systematic literature review is conducted to study the relation between <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> and systems approaches to innovation in 107 publications. The analysis of the <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> literature demonstrates that only a small fraction is systems-oriented as compared to the bulk of publications with a technology-oriented approach. The analysis of agricultural innovations systems literature shows that, although <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> is addressed, the potential of this systems approach remains largely unexplored for <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> innovation. A large share of the publications included in this review focus on cropping or farming ‘systems’ while ‘innovation’ often equals the development, transfer, adoption and diffusion of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> technologies at farm level.

In choice assays, we tested dose-dependent feeding and oviposition deterrence of the two fatty acid derivatives methyl jasmonate and cis-jasmone, the phenylpropanoid allylanisole, and their blends when directly applied to bean leaf discs. The concentration required to reduce the feeding damage by 50 % relative to the control treatment (FDC 50) was lowest for cis-jasmone and highest for allylanisole. The feeding deterrent effect of both jasmonates was increased when blended with allylan-isole. Feeding deterrence and oviposition deterrence were strongly correlated. In no-choice assays conducted over four consecutive days, we discovered that dilutions at low concentrations (FDC 15) applied to bean leaves resulted in habituation to the deterrents, whereas no habituation occurred at higher concentrations (FDC 50). We observed a tendency that the 1 : 1 blends reduce the probability that thrips habituate to the deterrent compounds.

40|$|Weed {{control is}} one of the most {{important}} crop protection activities undertaken in both intensive and low-input farming systems. However, even under intensive systems, crop protection which is less dependent on pesticides may require that weeds be managed to obtain a balance between crop and non-crop vegetation to encourage an increase in natural enemies of crop pests. In the low-input farming systems which sustain much of the rural population of Africa, weed control is usually done by hand and `clean weeding ' is often beyond the labour resources of the farming family. The vegetational diversity of peasant agriculture in Africa to which weeds make their contribution, helps to decrease the risk of disease and pest epidemics. In addition to the pest control bene®ts of a diverse agroecosystem, weeds contribute to the resource base of the rural community, providing a source of secondary foods, medicines and insecticides. Weed control within an <b>integrated</b> <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> system appropriate to the needs of the resource-poor farmer, requires that weeds are managed in such a way that their biodiversity is maintained and the more useful species retained within the ®eld or ®eld margin. Those weeds with high food potential or which have pesticidal or medicinal properties might be deliberately encouraged within the crop or ®eld margins. Certain weed species may harbour important pests or diseases of local crops and therefore should be selectively removed. The paper reviews and discusses the literature on the bene®cial and deleterious effects of weeds and argues for a weed management strategy which balances the effects of weed competition on crop production with the ethnobotanical and pest control attributes of individual weed species and weed communities...|$|E

Some of the aspects studied are: analysis and evaluation of {{the conditions in which}} agricultural entrepreneurs have to do their work; monitoring and evaluation of the results of entrepreneurship; analysis of the behaviour of groups of entrepreneurs itself to find explanations for past reactions or to predict future reactions of farmers on market or policy developments; improvement of the level of entrepreneurship through training in different aspects of this topic; ISP (Interactive Strategic Planning) can play a role in such learning processes.

40|$|Mycosphaerella graminicola is {{the causal}} agent of Septoria tritici blotch (STB) in winter wheat. This disease {{is called a}} ‘gradient disease’ because it {{generally}} progresses from the lower to upper leaf stages. Airborne ascospores originating in stubble or trash are now {{considered to be the}} most important source of primary infection in autumn and winter, whereas the subsequent development of STB occurs through the infection of the upper leaves by splash-dispersed pycnidiospores produced on the lower leaves. Recent reports and observations, however, question the importance of ascospores in the progress of STB epidemics after stem elongation in wheat plants. A method based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and using Burkard spore traps was developed to quantify M. graminicola airborne inoculum. The method was tested for its reliability and applied in a spore-trap network over a 4 -year period in order to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of airborne inoculum in Belgium. A seasonal distribution was observed, with the highest quantities trapped between June and mid-August and with clusters detected from September to April. Depending on the year or site, significant quantities of airborne inoculum were measured during the cereal stem elongation and heading stages, suggesting that ascospores contribute to the infection of upper leaves later in the season. When many peaks of airborne inoculum were detected during this period, the disease gradient due to the vertical progression of splash-dispersed pycnidiospores was not always well marked. The STB incidence observed on an upper leaf layer was sometimes greater than the incidence on a lower leaf layer, suggesting that the airborne inoculum accelerates the progression of the disease on the upper leaves of wheat plant. The exploration of the relationship between disease evolution, airborne inoculum detection and meteorological conditions would provide valuable information for <b>integrated</b> <b>crop</b> <b>protection...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{increasing}} food insecurity, new integrated and more sustainable crop protection methods need to be developed. The phyllosphere, i. e. the leaf habitat, hosts {{a considerable number of}} microorganisms. However, {{only a limited number of}} these are pathogenic and the roles of the vast majority still remain unknown. Managing the leaf-associated microbial communities is emerging as a potential <b>integrated</b> <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> strategy. This thesis reports the characterisation of the phyllosphere of barley, an economically important crop in Scotland, with the purpose of developing tools to manipulate it. Field experiments were carried out to determine the composition of the culturable bacterial phyllosphere. The leaf-associated populations were demonstrated to be dominated by bacteria belonging to the Pseudomonas genus. Two bacterial isolates, Pseudomonas syringae and Pectobacterium atrosepticum, hindered the growth of Rhynchosporium commune, the causal agent of the leaf scald, but promoted the development of powdery mildew symptoms, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei. However, using a molecular fingerprinting technique, namely T-RFLP, the global community was shown to be significantly richer and more diverse than indicated by the culture-based methods, thus increasing the complexity of interactions taking place in the phyllosphere. Various factors were found to affect the structure of the phyllobacteria significantly. Under controlled conditions, a root-associated symbiont, Piriformospora indica, was shown to increase the plant fitness and shift the abundance of the most common bacteria. In the field, both agro-chemical treatments tested, conventional fungicide and an elicitor mixture, increased the bacterial diversity, but fungicide application resulted in a higher yield and better protection against diseases. Finally, the plant genotype also affected the phyllosphere structure. Mutations in the leaf epicuticular waxes led to significant changes in the bacterial diversity and differentially affected disease in the field. A negative correlation between bacterial diversity and scald infection was also observed...|$|E

Resource saving cultivation technologies with limi­ted application of fertilizers (Р 45 К 45 N 30 (II) + 30 (IV)) provided productivity {{at the level of}} 4, 87 – 5, 50 t/ha with grain qua­lity of the 2 nd– 3 rd class of A group. Grain yield of 6. 01  t/ha with indicators of the 2 nd– 3 rd class of quality was obtained with the use of intensive cultivation technology with application of mineral fertilizers (Р 90 К 90 N 30 (II) + 60 (IV) + 30 (VIII)) on the background of applying predecessor’s by-products and integra­ted crop protection. The highest yield of grain (6. 22 t/ha) with indicators of the 2 nd class of A group quality on average for the research period was provided by energy-intensive technology, that requires the application of mineral fertilize­rs (P 135 K 135 N 60 (II) + 75 (IV) + 45 (VIII)) and incorporation of predecessor’s by-products in the soil, and integrated plant protection. Conclusion. It was found that {{in the northern part of}} the Right-Bank Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine, the highest productivity of winter wheat was obtained in dark grey podzolic soils when using the energy-intensive technology with application of P 135 K 135 N 60 (II) + 75 (IV) + 45 (VIII) on the background of predecessor’s by-products and <b>integrated</b> <b>crop</b> <b>protection.</b> This technology ensured the grain yield of 6. 22 t/ha of the 2 nd class of A group quality...|$|E

They suggested a number of options for strengthening <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> efforts at the centers. This report, written by David R. MacKenzie, developed specific recommendations. The direction proposed was {{establishment of a network}} of <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> specialists in the CGIAR, evolving over a five year period into a center-without walls. This alternative was preferred to establishing a fixed center for <b>crop</b> <b>protection.</b> The document includes among its annexes a copy of the Phase I report of the study.

Conventional fertility management (based on mineral fertiliser applications) and conventional <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> (based on chemosynthetic pesticides) significantly increased the yield of winter barley {{as compared to}} organic fertility and <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> regimes. Severity of leaf blotch (Rhynchosporium secalis) was highest under organic fertility and <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> management and was correlated inversely with yield. For mildew (Erysiphe graminis), an interaction between fertility management and <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> was detected. Conventional <b>crop</b> <b>protection</b> reduced severity of the disease, only under conventional fertility management. Under organic fertility management, incidence of mildew was low and application of synthetic pesticides in “low input” production systems had no significant effect on disease severity...|$|R
