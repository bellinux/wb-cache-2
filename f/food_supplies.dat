40|$|Traceability in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains has {{received}} increased {{attention in the}} last decade. The efforts of governmental authorities have also increased to regulate and control <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains and product characteristics related to information to ensure safety, quality, and preservation of living resources. Previous studies in the area take an industrial focus and exclude the governmental authority focus. This thesis thus focuses on exploring governmental authority and industrial effects on traceability in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains. The purpose is to extend the traceability capabilities in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains that are influenced by governmental authorities. The thesis reports findings from literature reviews and case studies that investigated three research questions. The first question embraces different perspectives of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability in supply chain management (SCM) literature, {{as well as the}} science theoretical perspective of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability. The second question explores modelling techniques for mapping <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains based on two dimensional flows of information between a governmental authority and actors, and of the flows of physical goods in three fresh <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains. The third question concerns the effects on operational activities and traceability information in fresh <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains by implementing the RFID based smart goods concept. The results show that <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability is a multidisciplinary concept which is important for governmental authorities. Supply chain management techniques for mapping descriptive information flows and for capturing information in supply chains are applicable to improve traceability in fresh <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains. The thesis further examines the influence of traceability on operational activities in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains. The results presented contribute to the understanding of traceability in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains affected by governmental regulations from a managerial point of view. This is useful for authorities and industrial firms in the food industry as well as for academia, since it shows that <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability should be prioritised to influence future supply chain traceability setups and theoretical development of the research area...|$|R

40|$|In 1987, David Cairns {{proposed}} that a gradient of colony-based measures on seabirds {{could be used}} to assess <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> in the ocean. Measures closely tied to the ocean, such as foraging trip duration, would be sensitive to small declines in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> while measures more closely tied with the nest site, such as reproductive success, would be sensitive to large declines in <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b> The continual refinement of tracking devices holds the potential to clearly link variables measured via seabirds to <b>food</b> <b>supply,</b> possibly extending Cairns' hypothesis. Here, we review the various tests of Cairns' hypothesis, and demonstrate that those tests have had variable success, partly because of the complex and nonlinear relationships between <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> and colony-based measures. We summarize the metrics available from biologgers and argue that such devices can provide a more direct proxy of <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b> We conclude that Cairns' hypothesis can be extended to biologger-derived parameters and that seabird behavior can be used as an early warning signal for declining <b>food</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R
40|$|Tubenoses and swifts develop slowly, {{and often}} have a {{variable}} <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b> Lack (1968) attributed this to convergent evolution, arguing that slow growth is an adaptation allowing survival in environments with a variable <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b> In this thesis, I test {{whether there is a}} general relationship among bird species between slow growth rate and variability in <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b> I analysed data on nestling period, growth rates for mass and wing length, and variability in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> in birds using phylogenetically independent contrasts. Variability in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> may be correlated with feeding frequency, and growth rate is correlated with predation risk. I included these potential confounds in my analysis. Variability in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> was correlated with nestling period, and negatively correlated with mass and wing growth rate, taking average feeding frequency and predation risk into account. I show that nest site preference is incompletely coadapted with growth rate. The correlations between growth rate and variability in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> could also be explained by the proximate effect of environmental variability on growth. I therefore tested predictions of Lack's hypothesis, in comparison to those of growth models assuming facultative growth adjustments in response to variability in <b>food</b> <b>supply.</b> This further supported Lack's hypothesis. While Lack proposed that slow growth is an adaptation to variability in <b>food</b> <b>supply,</b> he did not explain the underlying mechanism. I examined three possible mechanisms, along with two alternative explanations where slow growth is not an adaptation to a variable <b>food</b> <b>supply,</b> and tested them with comparative data. I developed two of these models using computer simulations which predicted that survival is increased by reducing maximum lean tissue growth rates and increasing maximum fat deposition rates when <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> is variable. I tested predictions from these models using experiments on the Welcome Swallow, corroborating a model that predicts that lean tissue growth is prioritised over fat deposition but that fat deposition is facilitated by reduced lean tissue growth rates. I also tested whether swifts and tubenoses are adapted to an unpredictably, or predictably, variable <b>food</b> <b>supply,</b> and discuss the degree to which chicks of swifts and tubenoses are well designed for survival in environments with a variable <b>food</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R

40|$|This book {{highlights}} {{the issue of}} {{adaptation to climate change}} in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains, the management and policy implications and the importance of supply chain resilience. As the success of the entire <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain depends on the prosperity of farms and local communities, the direct climate change risks faced by the agricultural sector are also risks to businesses and <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains. Hence, the importance of resilience at farm level, community level and business level when looking at <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain policy and management. Attention is given to each phase of the supply chain: input production, agriculture, food processing, retailing, consumption and post-consumption. The book integrates various approaches related to sustainability, resilience and climate adaptation drawing from environmental management, environmental policy, agro-ecology, sociology and behavioral sciences. European case studies demonstrate the vulnerabilities of contemporary <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains, the opportunities and competitive advantages related to climate change, and the trans-disciplinary challenges related to successful climate adaptation. The authors argue for a redefinition of the way <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains are operated, located and coordinated and propose a novel approach enhancing climate-resilient <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain policy and management...|$|R

Identification of the valuable traceability information types in fresh <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains is conducted as the first step to reach the purpose. Literature is reviewed to identify a theoretical frame for the smart goods and traceability in the fresh <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains. Three Nordic supply chains of fresh food are studied for answering the research questions. The valuable types of traceability information from perspective of different actors of the fresh <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chains are identified as an outcome of the paper.

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} Several {{different}} perspectives exist {{on the importance of}} <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability and why it is scientifically investigated. These include the assessment of food security and quality preservation, economic, logistic, supply chain management, and information technical. Because of this, the concept of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability is defined in many different ways, depending on the scientific area of the research perspective used for investigation. This makes the concept and the scientific value of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability sometimes hard to understand theoretically. Thus, it is of great importance to position the concept theoretically and in relation to other scientific research areas. The purpose {{of this paper}} is to examine how <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability can be theoretically positioned in academic supply chain research. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a literature review of definitions and perspectives of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> traceability, and of the concepts and definitions used within the paradigm thinking found in relevant scientific articles and books. Findings: The results show that <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability is pre-paradigm research and further suggests that it should be treated as a “physical representational space” in scientific theory. The results also verify that <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability is a complex research field, which is studied by using several perspectives in different research areas, especially logistics. It is important to clarify the perspective that has been applied when making suggestions concerning logistics development. Research limitations/implications: The literature review only includes definitions and methods for positioning <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability from a scientific theoretical perspective. The study excludes the concepts “track and trace”, “internal traceability” and “external traceability”, which are used in <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain management. Practical implications: The results of this paper are useful for practitioners as well as researchers since it addresses and aims to explain the concept of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability from a scientific perspective. This should influence future supply chain traceability setups. What is original/value of paper: The paper provides an extended understanding of <b>food</b> <b>supply</b> chain traceability in relation to scientific theory in a new unique way that can influence future research in and development of the area, particularly concerning societal perspectives...|$|R
