5|$|Betances' {{last days}} were chaotic, {{not only because}} of the events in the Caribbean, but also because of what {{happening}} in his own household. Jiménez' mental state is reported as dubious by then. Some even suggest that she had become an alcoholic (probably) or even a morphine addict (unlikely) by then, and she even wished for her husband to die in tantrums reported by his doctors. Political foes attempted to gain possession of Betances' intelligence <b>dossiers,</b> as did Spanish intelligence agents in Paris. Betances asked personal friends to keep personal guard of him, which they did until he died.|$|E

5000|$|On January 10, 2017 CNN {{reported}} {{on the existence of}} classified documents that claimed Russia had compromising personal and financial information about President-elect Donald Trump. Both Trump and President Barack Obama had been briefed on the content of the <b>dossier</b> the previous week. CNN did not publish the <b>dossier,</b> or any specific details of the <b>dossier,</b> as they could not be verified. Later the same day, BuzzFeed published a 35-page <b>dossier</b> in full. BuzzFeed said that the <b>dossier</b> was unverified and [...] "includes some clear errors". The <b>dossier</b> had been read widely by political and media figures in Washington, and previously been sent to multiple journalists who had declined to publish it as unsubstantiated. In response the next day, Trump called the website a [...] "failing pile of garbage" [...] during a news conference. The publication of the <b>dossier</b> was also met with criticism from, among others, CNN reporter Jake Tapper, who called it irresponsible. BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith defended the site's decision to publish the <b>dossier.</b>|$|R
40|$|The British {{government}} {{published a}} <b>dossier</b> on 24 September 2002 setting out its claims regarding Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). 1 Parliament was recalled {{for an emergency}} session {{on the same day}} to hear Prime Minister Tony Blair’s presentation of it. The <b>dossier</b> stated that Iraq had WMD and was producing more. After the invasion in March 2003, no WMD were found. Ever since, there has been controversy as to whether the <b>dossier</b> reported accurately intelligence {{which turned out to be}} wrong, as Blair has claimed consistently, or whether the <b>dossier</b> deliberately deceived by intentionally giving the impression of greater Iraqi WMD capability and threat than the intelligence suggested. Despite a great deal of attention to the September <b>dossier,</b> there has not been any analysis conceptually well developed enough, or sufficiently grounded in the empirical evidence, to make much headway in resolving this disagreement. This article assesses the extent to which the <b>dossier</b> was part of a campaign of organized political persuasion and whether that campaign involved demonstrable deception. It shows that the <b>dossier</b> did not accurately represent the content and strength of intelligence that turned out to be wrong. Instead, the <b>dossier</b> portrayed a misleading picture of greater capability and greater certainty than the intelligence warranted. The misleading nature of the <b>dossier</b> was not an accident. There was a concerted effort by many of those involved in producing the <b>dossier</b> to push the claims about the intelligence as far as possible. The phrase “dodgy dossier” was originally used to describe this September <b>dossier.</b> 2 The British government published another <b>dossier</b> on 3 February 2003 which was exposed as being mostly plagiarized. 3 Subsequently, the term “dodgy dossier” has tended to be applied mainly to this second <b>dossier.</b> In view of the arguments in this article, the September <b>dossier</b> ought to be known as the deceptive <b>dossier.</b> The argument in this article is structured in four sections. The first section surveys official claims regarding the <b>dossier,</b> the results of four successive inquiries (the fifth has not yet reported), and the scholarly literature to date. Here the article shows that, despite some discussion of the <b>dossier</b> in numerous publications, there has still not been an in‐depth analysis of its contents and production which is conceptually well developed and which draws on vital information that has become available in the last few years. The second section sets out the conceptual framework, while the third applies it to the empirical record. The article shows that the <b>dossier</b> was fundamentally misleading about the intelligence and that deliberate deception through omission and distortion was involved. The conclusion considers the significance of the deceptive <b>dossier...</b>|$|R
5|$|Recuerdos de Provincia (Recollections of a Provincial Past), 1850. In {{this second}} autobiography, Sarmiento {{displays}} a stronger effort to include familial links and ties to his past, {{in contrast to}} Mi defensa, choosing to relate himself to San Juan and his Argentine heritage. Sarmiento discusses growing up in rural Argentina with basic ideologies and simple livings. Recuerdos discusses his Similar to Facundo, Sarmiento uses previous <b>dossiers</b> filed against himself by enemies to assist in writing Recuerdos and therefore fabricating an autobiography based on these files and from his own memory. Sarmiento's persuasion in this book is substantial.

5|$|UEFA {{awarded the}} right to host the final to the Stade de France in Saint-Denis after {{considering}} its merits in terms of capacity, stadium infrastructure and <b>dossiers</b> including city and airport agreements and promotional plans. UEFA also conducted a variety of site visits. The Stade de France previously staged the 2000 UEFA Champions League Final between Real Madrid and Valencia, which Madrid won 30 {{and was the first}} time two clubs from the same country had faced each other in the final. Saint-Denis was chosen to host the final in recognition of the 50th anniversary of the first European Cup final in 1956, held in nearby Paris at the Parc des Princes, now home of Paris Saint-Germain. The Parc des Princes also hosted the 1975 and 1981 European Cup finals, the 1978 and 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup finals, and the 1998 UEFA Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was finally}} {{convinced}} {{of the need to}} try every possible method to stop Bomber Command's night offensive over Germany. The operation was sanctioned by the OKL in November. Secrecy of the operation was paramount. The problem of preparing a large number of crews produced security fears which was recognised clearly. When crews of NJG 3 and NJG 2 were called to a briefing on Gisela, they were locked behind guarded doors. The crews were told that all available night fighters would participate in an all-out attack against Bomber Command over their airfields in England. The tactical deployment for the operation, they were told, was for two waves of night fighters to cross the coast in the region of Hull. To avoid enemy radar raiders were told to fly at minimum altitude and then climb to 4,500 metres as they reached the coast, generally believed to be the average operating height of British bombers. The Luftwaffe Western Front Intelligence Summary Service prepared <b>dossiers</b> for crews to study. It advised on the layout of British airfields and the lighting systems, such as the Drem system, along with funnel lights and angle of glide indicators. Crews were warned about RAF lighting codes on the control towers which warned RAF bomber crews of a possible intruder in the vicinity.|$|E

5000|$|In 1983, Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens {{compiled}} a <b>dossier,</b> telling his family it was [...] "explosive" [...] and would [...] "blow the lid" [...] on powerful and famous child abusers. The <b>dossier</b> was {{handed over to}} the then Home Secretary, Leon Brittan, who acknowledged receipt in a letter and suggested the police had been informed. The <b>dossier</b> was subsequently lost. The Observer revealed on 5 July 2014 that the Dickens <b>dossier</b> was just one of 114 potentially relevant files found to be missing by officials when they did their initial search. The chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee Keith Vaz said that files had been lost [...] "on an industrial scale".

After the issue had been raised again by Labour MP Simon Danczuk in July 2014, former Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Macdonald, said {{the circumstances in which}} the <b>dossier</b> had gone missing were alarming and recommended an inquiry into the fate of the <b>dossier.</b> Prime Minister David Cameron asked the Home Office Permanent Secretary to investigate {{what had happened to the}} missing <b>dossier.</b> Danczuk responded that another internal inquiry was merely trying to limit damage, and that a public inquiry was necessary to retain public confidence.
