25|$|The second theory {{proposed}} by Horne, {{the growth of}} calcium phosphate nanoclusters begins the process of micelle formation but is limited by binding phosphopeptide loop regions of the caseins. Once bound, protein-protein interactions are formed and polymerization occurs, in which K-casein is used as an <b>end</b> <b>cap,</b> to form micelles with trapped calcium phosphate nanoclusters.|$|E
25|$|But retail {{support for}} HD DVD was eroding. In June 2007, Blockbuster, {{at the time}} the largest U.S. movie rental company, moved to Blu-ray {{exclusively}} in 1450 stores after test-marketing both formats at 250 stores and finding that more than 70% of high definition rentals were Blu-ray discs. In July 2007, Target Corporation, began carrying only Blu-ray standalone players in its stores, promoting them with <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> displays featuring Blu-ray Disc movies from Sony and Disney.|$|E

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{environmental}} stability and mechanical properties of polyimidesulfone (PISO 2), {{it was decided}} to investigate the effects of various types of <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> on its thermo-mechanical and related properties. It was noted that <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> are effective in reducing the environmental damage susceptibility of PISO 2 samples, apparently due to their ability to react with free end groups which are believed to be moisture pickup sites. Phthalic anydride, aniline and aminobenzophenone were the <b>end</b> <b>caps</b> used in this study...|$|R

500|$|One of Kaczynski's tactics {{was leaving}} false clues in every bomb. He would {{deliberately}} make them {{hard to find}} to mislead investigators into thinking they had a clue. The first clue was a metal plate stamped with the initials [...] "FC" [...] hidden somewhere (usually in the pipe <b>end</b> <b>cap)</b> in every bomb. One false clue he left was a note in a bomb that did not detonate which reads [...] "Wu—It works! I told you it would—RV". Another clue was the Eugene O'Neill $1 stamps used to send his boxes. One of his bombs was sent embedded in a copy of Sloan Wilson's novel Ice Brothers.|$|E

In order to avoid uplift in the {{supporting}} columns, the span is terminated with a massive concrete end weight. This end weight also carries the turning saddles for the main cables. As seen in the northwest corner image above, there is an upward component to the tension force provided by the main cable, {{and it is this}} component that removes most of the weight of the <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> from its columns. (The greater, horizontal, component is countered by the compressive forces exerted by the box deck structure as is characteristic of this type of bridge.) ...|$|E

50|$|Oxfords {{were derived}} from the Oxonian, a half-boot with side slits that gained {{popularity}} at Oxford University in 1800. Unlike early shoes, Oxfords were cut smaller than the foot. The side slit evolved into a side lace that eventually moved to the instep, as students rebelled against knee-high and ankle-high boots. The toe cap can either be lined with two narrow rows of stitching, perforated holes along the <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> stitching (quarter-brogue), perforated holes along the <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> stitching and on the toe cap (semi-brogue), or a semi-brogue with the classical wingtip design (full-brogue).|$|E
5000|$|In 3D {{computer}} graphics, a smoothing {{group is}} a group of polygons in a polygon mesh which should appear to form a smooth surface. [...] Smoothing groups are useful for describing shapes where some polygons are connected smoothly to their neighbors, and some are not. For example, in a mesh representing a cylinder, all of the polygons are smoothly connected except along the edges of the end caps. One could make a smoothing group containing all of the polygons in one <b>end</b> <b>cap,</b> another containing the polygons in the other <b>end</b> <b>cap,</b> and a last group containing the polygons in the tube shape between the end caps.|$|E

50|$|One {{system works}} by {{providing}} pre-cut lengths of safety wire {{that have a}} large cap on one end. The cable is threaded through a hole on the fastener to be secured, which {{is large enough to}} accommodate the wire but too small for the cap {{on the other end of}} the cable to pass through it. After the other end of the wire is passed through the anchor point, the technician takes an extra <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> and the special tool that is available from Daniels and crimps the cap on to that end of the wire. Again, the <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> is too large to pass through the hole that the wire passed through, and thus the cable is secured.|$|E
50|$|Three {{air force}} batons were awarded {{in the summer}} of 1940. They had blue velvet {{covering}} and the Balkenkreuz design, differing only in individual <b>end</b> <b>cap</b> inscriptions.
