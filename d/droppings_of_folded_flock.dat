"I did {{not feel}} safe there, however; {{people were going to}} and fro, and I prowled restlessly about until I came upon a huge section in an upper floor {{containing}} multitudes of bedsteads, and over these I clambered, and found a resting-place at last among a huge pile <b>of</b> <b>folded</b> <b>flock</b> mattresses. The place was already lit up and agreeably warm, and I decided to remain where I was, keeping a cautious eye on the two or three sets of shopmen and customers who were meandering through the place, until closing time came. Then I should be able, I thought, to rob the place for food and clothing, and disguised, prowl through it and examine its resources, perhaps sleep on some of the bedding. That seemed an acceptable plan. My idea was to procure clothing to make myself a muffled but acceptable figure, to get money, and then to recover my books and parcels where they awaited me, take a lodging somewhere and elaborate plans for the complete realisation of the advantages my invisibility gave me (as I still imagined) over my fellow-men.|$|R

Sera from four patients with BFL and two controls without exposure were analyzed by Western blotting with antigens from <b>droppings</b> <b>of</b> two pigeon and budgerigar strains and two hen species. When the antigens from the <b>droppings</b> <b>of</b> the three bird species were compared, the profile of immunogenic proteins was different and there were similarities between strains of the same species.

These results provide insight to further characterize these proteins, and to design new serological tests specific to different bird species.
