25|$|As {{commercial}} use of electric energy {{spread in the}} 1880s, it became increasingly important that an electric energy meter, similar to the then existing <b>gas</b> <b>meters,</b> was required to properly bill customers {{for the cost of}} energy, instead of billing for a fixed number of lamps per month. Many experimental types of meter were developed. Edison at first worked on a direct current (DC) electromechanical meter with a direct reading register, but instead developed an electrochemical metering system, which used an electrolytic cell to totalise current consumption. At periodic intervals the plates were removed and weighed, and the customer billed. The electrochemical meter was labor-intensive to read and not well received by customers.|$|E

Gardner's attorney presented a letter his client wrote to Oprah Winfrey requesting funds for the project.

40|$|Abstract. This {{project is}} focused on the {{performance}} curve of <b>gas</b> <b>metering</b> calibration system for low pressure low flow rate domestic <b>gas</b> <b>meter.</b> Visual Basic 6. 0 has been employed to carry out comparison of the calibration performance curve. Data gathered from previous work will be used to enable performance comparison. Wet type <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> will be used as the reference meter in order to calibrate domestic <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> due to its high accuracy and suitable operating condition at low pressure and low flow rate. Diaphragm <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> has been selected as predominant domestic <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> that normally represents common domestic <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> application as a gas-measuring device. From the experiment, several operating condition will be carried out to obtain high accuracy measurement to calibrate the diaphragm meter with flow capacity up to 1. 20 m 3 /hr at an operating pressure of 35 milibar (14 inches water column), with setting temperature of 19 °C to 23 °C. The operation of calibration process incorporates the use of three types of test fluid namely; compressed air, nitrogen and liquefied petroleum gas. Results obtained show that pressure drop increases when flow rate increases and error of new meters increases with the increasing of flow rate until a maximum point reached at less than 2. 0 %. Therefore all the results obtained are valid and traceable...|$|R
2500|$|In the United States, {{retail sales}} {{are often in}} units of therms (th); 1 therm = 100,000BTU. <b>Gas</b> <b>meters</b> measure the volume of gas used, and this is {{converted}} to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period, which varies slightly over time. Wholesale transactions are generally done in decatherms (Dth), or in thousand decatherms (MDth), or in million decatherms (MMDth). A million decatherms is roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas.
