40|$|Foreword Fishing {{is a vital}} {{source of}} food, jobs and income that {{contributes}} to food security and poverty reduction in many African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) coastal states. But most of these countries, especially Senegal, Mauritania and Namibia, rely heavily on {{a small number of}} exported species. Even so, the fisheries sector provides ACP countries with real longer-term economic opportunities because the EU imports 60 % of the fish consumed in its home market. The heavy toll taken of stocks and ecosystems by over-exploitation of fishery resources is undermining all sustainable development efforts in regions like West Africa. This makes proper resource management and effective control systems vital to avoid over-fishing and the collapse of fish stocks, so that ACP countries can benefit significantly from this sector of the economy. <b>Fisheries</b> <b>relations</b> between the ACP States and the EU are governed by a range of instruments, especially ACP national fisheries policies, the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy, development cooperation instruments and the bilateral fisheries agreements entered into by the EU with individual ACP States. Bilateral agreements give European fishing fleets greater access to fishery resources in exchange for the payment of financial compensation, which is a major source of income for ACP States. These agreements introduce a series of problems in the picture with regard to: (i) sustainable exploitation of marine resources and environmental protection, (ii) protection for artisanal fishing communities, maximizing the benefits of fishing through value-enhancement, and (iv) monitoring systems. These issues of ACP-EU <b>fisheries</b> <b>relations</b> are also addressed in Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA) negotiated by ACP countries with the EU. The revision of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) to achieve more sustainable fishing and greater protection of the marine environment should deliver a net gain to ACP fishers. Against this background, CTA works with the ACP Secretariat, European Commission and Commonwealth Secretariat to give ongoing support to ACP countries, not least by providing a forum for ACP and EU experts to exchange information. Over 350 experts and policymakers from ACP and EU Ministries of Trade and Fisheries, along with representatives of the Brussels-based ACP Group, the European Commission, the private sector, NGOs, fisheries associations, international organisations, EU development cooperation agencies and research bodies took part in two technical seminars held in Brussels in April 2003 and December 2004, followed up by an electronic consultation to further explore the two big issues of market access and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU). This publication reviews the main approaches of these players to issues {{at the top of the}} ACP-EU <b>fisheries</b> <b>relations</b> agenda. Improving access to information The recommendations highlight the key role of information and communication technologies (ICT). CTA provides services and products that improve access to information for agricultural and rural development in ACP countries. For example, CTA works together with key partners in the fisheries sector to facilitate in situ or electronic discussion fora, as well as capacity-building and training programmes, and funding participation by ACP experts to present the ACP case in international meetings. CTA also provides information portals (websites) on the fisheries sector - “Agritrade”, “Knowledge for Development”, as well as “ICT Update”, a newsletter specifically on ICT applications in the fisheries sector. For those without Internet access, CTA continues to support a range of other media like rural radio, mobile phones, the print media like the magazine Spore/Esporo, and a wide range of publications, many focused on the fisheries sector. It has also very recently launched a new series of easily-reproducible “how-to” guides providing technical information in easy-to-understand terms, offering yet another opportunity to engage with fishing and fishers. Growing demand from our ACP partners and the importance of the fisheries sector prompts me to reaffirm the commitment of CTA and its partners to further developing these services, providing platforms through which to leverage empirical knowledge, and facilitating the exchange of expertise and experiences. I should also like to take this opportunity to thank all our partners and the ACP and EU authors who so kindly undertook to formulate and finalize the presentation of this wealth of experiences. I hope you will find it instructive reading.

40|$|The article {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the globalisation debate in the context of international fisheries governance. It argues that there are significant transformations in fisheries policy-making in international economics, international institutions and international law-making which alter state authority in fisheries management. Thus, decision-making at international, regional and national levels is increasing, displaced from the state level. This 'multi-level' decision-making is exemplified in the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation's Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, 1995. The Code represents a sound instrument of fisheries governance, capable of responding to contemporary global transformations. Changes are illustrated by comparing the Code and the Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, 1995, in the areas of international economics, institutions and law-making. Reference is made to interaction between a range of actors and to formal and informal procedures. In conclusion, a process of 'fisheries governance' is confirmed, emerging from a new environment of international <b>fisheries</b> <b>relations...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fishery {{cooperation}} {{agreements with the}} Sub-Saharan West African coastal states are considered by the European Union as purely commercial deals {{that are designed to}} maximize access to coastal state fishery resources, secure employment for European harvesting and processing industries and supply European seafood consumption markets at the lowest possible cost. Financial compensation paid by Brussels to the West African countries for fishing rights covers two-thirds or more of the license fees and is a subsidy for European vessel owners. This subsidy puts EU in position of a preferred user of the coastal resources. That displaces foreign investors and local entrepreneurs in the coastal states, distorts economics of the European fishing enterprises and promotes excessive pressure on the resources that greatly harms the marine environment in the West African region. Analysis of EU’s relations with Guinea-Bissau shows that together with manipulation of the size of fishing fleet used by EU in this country’s waters, there were significant irregularities resulting from excessive by-catch, underpayment of tuna license fees and denial of timely statistical information for the coastal state. Continuation of this type of relations with Sub-Saharan West Africa is against the long-term interests of the coastal states and sustainability of the coastal resources. Unless significant changes in fishing policies of the EU are made, West African coastal countries will face severe overexploitation of their resources and subsequent drop in license revenues.

40|$|With almost {{three-quarters of}} the world s marine fish stocks {{thoroughly}} depleted, the question is very much alive. Not least in those ACP countries whose waters host rich shoals of fish. The islands of the Caribbean, and the Pacific and Indian Oceans, are highly vulnerable, as are African economies such as Mauritania, Namibia and Senegal. For Senegal, fisheries provide 15 % of employment, 30 % of exports, and 12 % {{of the gross domestic}} product. Some 60 % of landings are from artisanal fisheries. Overfishing is rife. Two in three fish consumed in Europe come from outside EU waters, often from ACP waters, usually through bilateral agreements which give access to 500 EU boats (20 % of the EU fleet). Mind you, not for nothing does the term IUU (Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported) feature in the jargon. Europe s capacity to fish and hence satisfy consumers and keep fishing communities intact exceeds by 40 % the capacity required to harvest fish sustainably. Do the sums, and you ll find that some very vested interests have to walk the plank. The dilemma is an ugly one, at least as ugly as some of the beasts now trawled up from the deep. A solution must be found the alternative is no fish at all. In early April 2003, 150 people gathered in Brussels, Belgium under the auspices of CTA and the Commonwealth Secretariat, to discuss EU/ACP <b>fisheries</b> <b>relations</b> policy-makers, negotiators, inter-governmental bodies, NGOs and issue groups. Their tasks: to enhance ACP effectiveness in attaining sustainability in fisheries, through conserving the natural capital of ACP fisheries and maximising the economic and social benefits for ACP countries.

40|$|We {{had done}} well {{to heed the}} advice of Mamadou, to wrap up against the chilly Mauritanian night and the bumps of his boat. "You ll be sore long before dawn," he had winked, "stay alert by {{counting}} my catch, on the fingers of one hand if it s like it was last week. " In the distance, west-north-west, under the fleeting light of a moon, lights jerk and bob and swing like dancers grouped above the waves. The whish of the wind is broken by an occasional barked comment in the dark, or a fisherman chatting into a mobile phone. Mamadou s solemn face is almost golden from his lantern, except when he turns on his hand-held computer. Then it beams the image, a ghost-like grey, of a satellite-guided map as if he didn t know his exact position anyway, some 10 km offshore, above sandbanks washed by the high tide. We peer to the west, deep into the dark. See them or not, hear them or not, there lie the fleets of factory boats, busy vacuuming the ocean deep sucking out every atom of life from the sea, {{as if it was}} dust, and as if there is no tomorrow. There is, to be sure, no tomorrow in a world which treats its open seas, and all that lives there, as rapaciously as a horde of looters raiding a shopping centre after a fire. The results of this overfishing are clear. For a local fishing community, such as the Mauritanian fisherfolk, it is the loss of catches today that will affect their tomorrow, since the intricate ecosystem of the ocean that allows many species to spawn will have been severely disturbed. That sets off an ugly spiral of sagging incomes, no investment, erosion of local livelihoods, impact on culture and worse. For fisherfolk 7, 000 km away, off the white sands of the Tanzanian and Mozambican coasts, the impact of foreign trawlers at sea is compounded by the development of coastal tourist facilities which impede access to inshore fishing grounds. Continue south-east another 1, 000 km or so, to the coasts of Madagascar there industrial-scale prawn farms have dislodged both local fisherfolk and the mangroves so cherished as the breeding ground of aquatic biodiversity. Catch your customer Why are the coastal waters off Namibia, Mauritania and Senegal some of the most fertile fishing grounds in the world so full of foreign fishing boats: from China, Japan, the ex-Soviet Union and, in great numbers, the European Union? Why do EU boats negotiate fishing rights around the vulnerable island of Kiribati, literally {{on the other side of}} the world (see Spore 101) ? The answer lies in part in the marine flesh piled high in the worlds fish markets, such as the raw and raucous fish halls of Tokyo in Japan, or Madrid in Spain. As any fish trader there will tell you with myopic passion, there is a demand to be met, even if fish prices in the shops are soaring as fast as nets being hauled to the surface. The answer lies too in the chained-up trawlers on Canada s north-eastern coast, or on the almost deserted fish quay of North Shields in north-eastern England. Once, North Shields was home to 122 fishing boats, which played their part in depleting the North Sea of the cod and herring so much a part of European culture. No more. In mid-June 2003, a local skipper told Spore that the quay was "on the brink of decimation", with the three remaining boats having too few permits to chase too few fish. The hunt for more fish is getting harder. Less for locals To fish is to hunt, and there is not much wrong with that. Man is a hunter, after all. Professor Stella Williams of Obafemi Awolowo University in Nigeria calls fishing "an ancient human tradition, involving the hunting and gathering of aquatic products for food", though she forcefully emphasises the role of women in inshore fishing, and in processing and marketing. "The tradition of fishing has been transformed over several decades to become a resource extraction industry spanning the entire globe. Nature s limits of aquatic life have been breached by too many fishing craft catching too many fish. " One simple sum brings her point home: more than 60 % of fish products consumed in the EU come from outside EU waters, and yet 70 % of fish stocks worldwide, said the FAO in 2000, can be considered as fully or over-exploited. The result: less for locals, themselves prone to overfishing. According to FAO, over the past 30 years the availability of fish per capita in Africa as a whole has declined, and in countries such as Ghana and Liberia the average diet contained less fish protein in the 1990 s than it did during the 1970 s, when it accounted for about 20 % of the animal-protein intake. For nine African countries, fishing contributed more than 5 % of Gross Domestic Product in 2000. In the Caribbean and Pacific, similar levels exist but all countries are vulnerable. Yet look at the development plans of most of the 63 ACP States with coastal fisheries, from trade to livelihood to nutrition, and there is always an assumption of increased and improved fisheries. It s a management problem Just as men and women on land soon caught on to the benefits of stewarding the resources they would hunt and gather agriculture, in a word then so it must be when they visit the sea. An EU fisheries spokesman recently defended its fishing policies: "Fishing in third countries is not unethical, the point is to make sure it is done in a proper way. " One attempt is contained in the Fisheries Partnership Agreements which transform bilateral deals from the earlier pay, fish and go access agreements that allowed about 500 EU boats to fish in ACP waters into joint investment in sustainable fisheries. This is a sea change indeed; no wonder that the talk at the April 2003 co-seminar of the Commonwealth Secretariat and CTA in Brussels, Belgium on ACP-EU <b>fisheries</b> <b>relations</b> was full of words like "challenges" and "broadening mutual interests". When the cake has to shrink, who wants to slice it? What shines through the mists of mistrust are two, irreconcilable attitudes. One is the dogma of EU fishery interests: accepting a repackaging, but not a restructuring, of their apparent right to fish anyone s fish. At play here are consumer interests, electoral concerns about job losses in European ports and some very well-placed, and somewhat cavalier, vested interests. Against them stands the more reasonable approach, often spawned in civil society, to re-engineer a sector that has over-extended itself. For the former, it is the blunt negotiation of how much can we get?. For the latter, the issues are more subtle. How to redirect the massive EU subsidies from EU fleets and their low quayside prices, to the overriding need for proper management not so much of marine resources, but of the way people deal with them: methods, measurements, catch periods, monitoring and policing, capacity building, local processing, quotas for local markets, regulatory mechanisms, and even fair fishing? How to mesh redirected subsidies with the World Trade Organization s intolerance of any at all? Management, too, of the process of including small fishing communities in the development of coastal aquaculture and marine farming, as opposed to simply more responsible marine hunting. Give fish a chance At the macro-level, in Europe, North America and North-east Asia, there is frantic but focused lobbying of the donor communities to redirect their resources to empower local communities in the management of their fisheries in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia and the Pacific. And at the micro-level, there are heartening examples of exchanges between fisherfolk of the Caribbean and West Africa, or the Indian state of Kerala and East Africa, swapping experiences in catch management, cooperative organisation and processing. Many solutions lie in such local initiatives, but the real problem fishing fleets from afar lurks out on the horizon. It is on that horizon that change has to come. Every culture has its fishing songs. From the quay of North Shields in England, comes this one, but it could be from anywhere: "Dance to your daddy, my little laddie; dance to your daddy, my little man; you shall have a fishy on a little dishy; you shall have a fishy when the boat come in. " In terms of ACP-EU <b>fisheries</b> <b>relations,</b> the question is not only whose boat it will be that comes in or if there will be a fishy aboard, but also if there are any little laddies (and lasses) still there when it does. We really should be going fishing no more. Not unless there are political and economic changes as deep as any ocean...|$|E

40|$|Abstract only. Like many global pelagic fisheries, the Hawaii-based {{longline}} fishery {{continues to}} face increased pressure {{to reduce the}} incidental catch of endangered sea turtles and/or other sensitive species. Aggregation and movement of both sea turtles and fish are directly associated with climatic variations and oceanographic conditions. As a result, both targeted species and incidental catch rates vary spatially and temporally. Accordingly, successful policy designs of fishery management in terms of effectiveness in turtle avoidance and commercial viability need to consider and adopt the spatial and temporal variations of oceanographic and climate conditions. A spatial bio-economic model was developed to incorporate sea surface temperature (SST), lunar phase, and other variables with temporal and spatial variations. Through the application of this model, this study explores the trade-offs between turtle interaction reduction and the economic return in the Hawaii-based swordfish <b>fishery</b> in <b>relation</b> to the climate variation and fishing behavior changes.

40|$|Nearly all of {{the marine}} fish and {{shellfish}} living along coastlines release microscopic larvae into the open ocean. The larvae then disperse for weeks to months before settling back into coral reefs and kelp forests. The larvae are too small and they travel too far to be tracked directly. Yet, knowing where these larvae settle is important for conservation and management. By quantifying the origins of a reef’s population, one can {{determine the extent to}} which that reef is dependent on other fish and shellfish populations for the replenishment of the next generation. Understanding these patterns of “connectivity” and “dependency” among reefs is critical for determining how to best protect, fish, and manage our coastlines. To complicate matters, connectivity patterns change annually. An example of such changes along the Pacific Coast of North America has to do with El Niño’s, which occur every few years, and generate warm, northward-flowing ocean currents that transport marine larva up the coast. Thus, it is hypothesized that El Niño’s can make northern reefs dependent on southern populations for new supplies of fish and shellfish. There is evidence showing that El Niños will increase in frequency and intensity with the changing climate, and because strategic management of <b>fisheries</b> in <b>relation</b> to effects of El Niño on connectivity could produce large gains in catches and profit, such present and future implications of El Niño events highlight the importance of studying them when the occur...|$|R

In 1983, I conceived with Professor Lewis Alexander of the University of Rhode Island a system for assessing and managing marine resources within the spatial domain of ecologically delineated large marine ecosystems (LMEs). On behalf of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and in partnership withdeveloping countries, international financial organizations,UNagencies, andNGOs, I amcurrently contributing scientific and technical advice to a global network of assessment and management projects in 22 LMEs with 110 developing countries and $ 3. 1 billion in financial support. The participating countries are applying amodular frameworkof natural science and social science indicators for assessing the changing states of LMEs. ...|$|R

The goal {{of this paper is to}} show that fisheries scientists will have to adapt to the new requirements represented by this principle, first and foremost by adjusting the model of decision-making in a way that facilitates communication of the uncertainties involved in their advice to the managers and stakeholders. The paper consists of three parts. First, a general description of fisheries management in the North Atlantic area managed by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) is presented; second, the collapse of the North Sea herring stock is used as a case to illustrate the uncertainty involved in fisheries management and how it has been handled by scientists and managers; finally, the obligation of scientists involved in <b>fisheries</b> research in <b>relation</b> to {{the political}} goal of a precautionary management is discussed. fishery management; herring; precautionary approach; scientists' responsibility; uncertainty. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{international}} symposium {{devoted to}} Research and small-scale fisheries (Durand, Lemoalle, Weber, 1991) in Montpellier (France) in 1989 came from increasing evidence that “the complexity of small scale fisheries calls for applying knowledge from many fields in combined studies {{that can take}} advantage of a whole range of information”. Has this assessment changed twenty years later? The references to sustainable development and to socio and bio-ecological diversities have highlighted the relationships between small-scale fisheries and natural, economic, social, cultural, and institutional aspects. In this paper we exemplify such interactions in different small-scale <b>fisheries</b> contexts in <b>relation</b> with poverty and food security issues. We question the consequences of different types of fleet dynamics in terms of adaptability, vulnerability and resilience of harvested ecosystems, and the impacts of the regulation systems on fishing communities. More generally, we question the paradigm of sustainable self-regulated small-scale fisheries. Finally, with references to several worldwide case studies and ecosystems we provide a description of the diversity of small scale fisheries, of the frameworks used to represent them, and of associated sets of relevant indicators used in monitoring and management programs. This presentation may be a first step toward a revisited pluri-disciplinary research framework for small-scale fisheries. This could be based on a research network built in order to produce and mobilize knowledge from a more comprehensive set of small-scale fisheries case studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{northern}} shortfin squid, Illex illecebosus, inhabits {{the continental}} shelf and slope {{waters of the}} Northwest Atlantic Ocean between Iceland and {{the east coast of}} Florida and constitutes a unit stock throughout its range. The species is highly migratory, growth is rapid and the lifespan is short, up to 215 days for individuals inhabiting the USA shelf. I. illecebrosus is semelparous and females spawn and die within several days of mating. Thus, natural mortality increases with age for the age range where spawning occurs. Fishing mortality and spawning mortality occur simultaneously. Stock structure is complicated by the overlap of seasonal cohorts. Age data indicate that spawning occurs throughout the year and that the first several months of the US fishery are supported by the winter cohort. The onset and duration of the <b>fisheries</b> occur in <b>relation</b> to annual migration patterns on and off the continental shelf which appear to be highly influenced by environmental conditions. On the USA shelf, a bottom trawl fishery generally occurs during June through October. Since its inception in 1987, the domestic fishery has taken a majority of the total annual landings. In recent years, there has been no fishery on the Scotian Shelf and landings from the Newfoundland jig fishery have been very low. There are no stockwide research surveys and it is unknown whether NEFSC research bottom trawl surveys trac...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{biodiversity}} offsets {{is well established}} as an approach to environmental management. The concept has been suggested for environmental management in <b>fisheries,</b> particularly in <b>relation</b> to the substantial numbers of non-target species [...] seabirds in particular [...] caught and killed as incidental bycatch during fishing activities. Substantial areas of fisheries are being closed to protect these species at great cost to the fishing industry. However, other actions may be taken to offset the impact of fishing on these populations at lower cost to the fishing industry. This idea, however, has attracted severe criticism largely as it {{does not address the}} underlying externality problems created by the fishing sector, namely seabird fishing mortality. In this paper, we re-examine the potential role of compensatory mitigation as a fisheries management tool, although from the perspective of being an interim management measure while more long-lasting solutions to the problem are found. We re-model an example previously examined by both proponents and opponents of the approach, namely the cost effectiveness of rodent control relative to fishery area closures for the conservation of a seabird population adversely affected by an Australian tuna fishery. We find that, in the example being examined, invasive rodent eradication is at least 10 times more cost effective than area closures. We conclude that, while this does not solve the actual bycatch problem, it may provide breathing space for both the seabird species and the industry to find longer term means of reducing bycatch...|$|R
40|$|The River Darwen is {{a highly}} {{impacted}} Lancashire river with very little known about its fishery interest above the impassable weir at Salmesbury Bottoms. Below the weir there are populations of coarse fish around the confluence with the River Ribble. To the knowledge of local bailiff staff, prior to 1996 the fish population {{in the middle and}} upper River Darwen had never been surveyed by electric fishing. In order to address this lack of knowledge, a survey was undertaken during the summer of 1996 with the aim of evaluating the salmonid and cyprinid fish population in the river. Twenty two sites were surveyed by electric fishing between June 11 th and July 11 th 1996. Information was gathered on the presence and density of fish populations in the river catchment, and analysed according to the National Fisheries Classification Scheme in order to determine how these populations compare nationally with sites of similar habitat features. From this report, recommendations were made to improve and develop the <b>fishery</b> potential in <b>relation</b> to water quality and habitat prioritising areas classed as being Ashless. It was recommended that juvenile coarse fish should be stocked in the Houghton Bottoms area. This area has excellent fishery habitat and was found to contain a minor coarse fish population. Water quality in this stretch of river was thought to be good enough to establish a major coarse fish population. Fish were introduced {{for the first time in}} 1998 at Houghton Bottoms from the Agency's Leyland Fish Farm. 3000 each of Roach, Chub and Dace were introduced. Further fish introductions occurred in 2000 with the stocking of 1000 Chub, again from the Agency's Leyland Fish Farm in the Lower Darwen and Witton areas of the main river on a trial basis...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{fisheries}} management is to provide the conditions for long-term, high and sustainable fishing. Most of the fish stocks in the North-East Atlantic's are transboundary and straddling, and some international agreements {{in the field of}} regulation of their fishing are required for effective management. Achieving multilateral international agreements in the field of fisheries is very difficult and long-term process, because it affects the economic and political interests of the contracting parties. The paper considers results of the analysis of stock dynamics of the most important fishery resources in the North-East Atlantic – herring, blue whiting and mackerel – in different historical periods. As in the past few decades, we have seen periods of both managed and unmanaged <b>fisheries</b> and in <b>relation</b> to the value of stocks of pelagic fish there have been significant fluctuations, in this paper the authors have attempted to estimate the value of concerted international fisheries management to maintain a stable state of stocks of pelagic fish. Implementation of scientific recommendations agreed by the participating countries of ICES and the joint management of the herring stock management contribute to the preservation of stock stable and optimal levels of withdrawal of the object. The historical experience of the international fishing of blue whiting has shown that compliance by states involved in the fishery advice of ICES and its reserve management activities and promotes the good stock condition. To save the mackerel stock within safe biological boundaries it is necessary to achieve the agreed long-term plan for managing its fisheries between all participants in the fishery. In the long term for the conservation of stocks of herring, blue whiting and North East mackerel in the safe biological boundaries, the international regulation of their fisheries based on the scientific recommendations of ICES in the framework of NEAFC and the Consultations of Coastal States is necessary...|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, many lagoons {{around the}} world have {{experienced}} environmental degradation resulting from impacts of various drivers of change (e. g., natural disasters and aquaculture). This has created adverse consequences for lagoon ecosystems (e. g., habitat and species loss) and human societies (e. g., loss of fishing livelihoods and commons rights). Asia’s largest lagoon, Chilika lagoon, situated along the eastern coastline of Odisha, India, is no exception. This thesis investigates the gendered implications of environmental change in the small-scale fishery system of Chilika lagoon. It focuses on fisherwomen’s perspectives about changes in the <b>fishery</b> commons in <b>relation</b> to processes of adaptation. Three main research objectives frame this study: 1) to examine fisherwomen’s perspectives about drivers of change within the social-ecological system of Chilika lagoon and resulting changes in the fishery commons; 2) to analyze how environmental change (i. e. objective one) is impacting the livelihood of fisherwomen and how fisherwomen are responding; and 3) to examine how fisher communities are adapting to the ongoing process of environmental change, with a focus on the gendered implications of out-migration. As a result, this thesis addresses an important research gap by conducting a gender sensitive analysis of environmental change in Chilika that highlights often neglected perspectives of fisherwomen. Adopting a gender lens on environmental issues {{in the context of this}} research is crucial. This is because of the differential risks women experience as individuals, groups, community members, and in relation to men, and the specific knowledge and insights they have on processes of change. 	This research applied a participatory and qualitative case study based approach. A combination of research methods were employed including document review, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and participant observation. Additionally, an integrative conceptual framework was utilized to explore women’s narratives in relation to the uncertainty and complexity of environmental change, drawing on theories and concepts associated with social-ecological systems, drivers of change, the commons, and adaptation. Research findings demonstrate that gender is one of the primary social constructs that mediates resource use and community relationships. For example, traditionally, fishermen engage in catching fish in the lagoon, whereas fisherwomen participate in fish processing activities within their homes. An analysis of findings reveals that fisher communities in Chilika lagoon face a commons crisis that presents gender differentiated impacts and challenges for livelihoods to respond and adapt to environmental change. As fisher communities experience fishery resource access issues, rights infringements, and institutional rearrangements, fishermen are forced out of fishing and many fisherwomen show to bear the brunt of change. 	The results of this research provide useful insights and recommendations for practitioners and policy about sustaining the commons through collaborative approaches and decision-making that actively engages the fisher communities of Chilika lagoon–particularity the experiences and knowledge of fisherwomen...|$|R
40|$|Study Contract DG XIV. Ref N°. : PEM / 93 / 005 Objectives: 1. To {{estimate}} the discards {{of commercial and}} non-commercial species, including pinnipeds, cetaceans, sea turtles and sea birds, incidentally caught by different fishing gears of the Spanish fleets in ICES Divisions. 2. To estimate of the total volume and/or number discarded by fleet in each ICES Division by scaling-up {{the results of the}} sampling programme using data on the fishing effort. 3. To obtain the size composition of the most significant species of discards of different fisheries unit. 4. To evaluate of the causes of discard procedures per fleet. 5. To evaluate {{of the impact of the}} fishing activity in each <b>fishery</b> unit in <b>relation</b> to the total biomass catches. Methodologies : A discard sampling programme, taking place during the year 1994, was applied based on stratified random sampling by fisheries unit. Fishing gears used were, Trawl, Long Line, Gill Net, and Purse Seine in the ICES Subareas: VI, VII, VIII and IX. Discards volume of all taxa, including target species and low or noncommercial interest species including marine mammals, marine reptiles and sea birds, were sampled and quantified by observers on board commercial Spanish fishing vessels. Results: In 1994 by-catches of marine mammals and sea turtles were no J recorded during the sampling period, and only 5 sea bird by-catches were seen by the observers.. The comparison of the fleets regarding their ratios of discards, in 1994 by Spanish fleets, shows that the larger percentages of discards relative to the total catches are produced in the trawler fisheries (about 35 to 59 %). Conversely, purse seining in Division IXa and Subdivision Vlllc west show the lowest discard rates (1 to 6 %). Long line (8 to 18 %) gill net (25 %) and purse seiners in Subdivision Vlllc East and Division Vlllb (4 to 30 %) have asome intermediate amount of discards). If we analyze the results of total discards made by the fleet, it is trawling which produces the highest discard values (11 155 to 28 006 n, whereas gill net and purse seine In Divisions Vlllc and IXa produces a low volume (146 to 321 t). Total discard estimations for long lining and purse seiners in Subdivision Vlllc East and Division Vlllb show asome intermediate discard values (503 to 5 788 t) The reasons for discarding in 1994 produced by the Spanish fleet were basically: - the lack of commercial interest in many of the species caught, - the length of the trips which mean that it is not possible to maintain certain species on board, - the Spanish fleet's lack of quota for fishing certain species in certain zones, - the size of the individuals caught being below the minimum legal size and/or below the size with a commercial value, - individuals which deteriorate during the fishing process, - the hold capacity of the vessel which means that discards are produced, particularly in the case of purse seining and trawling in coastal areas, - the economic demands or decisions (marked fall in price due to the abundance of discards on certain days), - in low commercial value species, when the haul catch is very low, this species is discarded. Data from this study will be made available to ICES Working Groups on Assessment of Southern Self Demersal Stocks for Hake Megrim and Monks, on Assessment of Mackerel, Horse Mackerel, Sardine and Anchovy, on Assessment of Blue Whiting and in the Study Group on the Biology and Assessment of Deep-Sea Fisheries Resources...|$|R
