5|$|England batted {{again and}} Tallon {{dismissed}} George Emmett from Lindwall with a diving one-handed catch. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, {{who took it}} in his right <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dive, leaving England at 1/1. England then declared at 3/174; Tallon conceded nine byes and {{with more than a}} day was lost to rain, Tallon was not required as Australia batted out the last session for a draw.|$|E
5|$|Meechum remains Underwood's {{bodyguard}} once {{he becomes}} the president, and there {{does not appear to}} be any continuing sexual relationship. Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks) not to write anything that would damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> marker on one of the walls of the White House when he wants to replace a Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, {{and the only}} demand of mutineers—led by João Cândido Felisberto—was the {{abolition}} of what they called slavery: they objected to low pay, long hours, inadequate training, and punishments including bolo (being struck on the <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ferrule) {{and the use of}} whips or lashes (chibata), which eventually became a symbol of the revolt. By the 23rd, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general amnesty for the sailors. Senator Ruy Barbosa, long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the Federal Senate on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the Chamber of Deputies.|$|E
5|$|While {{going to}} meet Doggett and Scully, Wells gets shoved into a dominos game and while picking them up gets slashed on his right cheek from a man with the spider web tattoo on his hand. Wells tells Doggett and Scully that he is moving {{backwards}} in time and cannot recall the past few days. Doggett is skeptical, but Scully hears him out. Wells says {{there must be a}} reason for it and Scully suggests that the answer may already be within him. Studying the evidence of the case, Wells has a flash of the murder that reveals the knife in a <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spider web tattoo.|$|E
5|$|Lesnar's {{rapid rise}} to the top of WWE in 2002 led to a feud with The Undertaker, which {{involved}} a match at Unforgiven on September 22. The match ended in a double disqualification and Lesnar retained the title. Lesnar faced The Undertaker again at No Mercy, this time in a Hell in a Cell match. Leading up to the match, in the storyline, Lesnar broke The Undertaker's <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> propane tank. Despite Heyman begging McMahon not to let The Undertaker use his cast as a weapon, the request was denied and the match went on as planned. At No Mercy on October 20, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker to retain the title. After his Hell in a Cell match with The Undertaker, Lesnar successfully retained the WWE Championship in a handicap match with Heyman against Edge at Rebellion on October 26.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall then struck Edrich on the <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> short ball, {{provoking}} angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Larwood. During this period, both Edrich and Compton {{found it}} difficult to position themselves quickly enough to play Lindwall. The Australian paceman then hit Compton on the arm, and soon after, felled him with a bouncer that the batsman top-edged into his face. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 2/33. Upon hearing the umpire’s call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that after rebounding from his head, it flew more than half-way to the boundary before landing. This was followed by a period of slow play as England tried to regroup.|$|E
5|$|The 'Beating of the bounds' is {{an ancient}} annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the {{traditional}} checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364. The Admiral of the Port of Poole (the mayor) and other dignitaries, {{and members of the}} public sail {{from the mouth of the}} River Frome to Old Harry Rocks to confirm the Mayor's authority over the water boundaries of the harbour and check for any encroachments. As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember the bounds of their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving the beating of a boy and pricking of a girl's <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> needle. In modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.|$|E

25|$|A solid bullet {{represents}} flexing {{the middle}} joint of a finger or fingers, and a hollow bullet represents straightening a flexed finger. That is, a 'D' <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> solid bullet {{means that it}} becomes an 'X' hand, while an 'X' <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hollow bullet means that it becomes a 'D' hand. If the fingers are already flexed, then a solid bullet shows that they squeeze. For example, a square (closed fist, 'S' hand) with double solid bullets is the sign for 'milk' (iconically squeezing an udder).|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of clipped, scraped, or {{counterfeit}} coins, the commodity value was reduced by fraud, as the face value remains at the previous higher level.

25|$|In his {{characteristic}} fashion, Hazlitt {{looks back}} to an earlier subject of these essays and compares Mackintosh with Coleridge.

Mackintosh, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> similarly impressive command of his subject matter, mechanically presents the thinking of others. There is no integration of his learning with his own thinking, no passion, nothing fused {{in the heat of}} imagination.|$|E

25|$|The {{engraving}} {{of copper}} rollers {{is one of}} the most important branches of textile printing and on its perfection of execution depends, in great measure, the ultimate success of the designs. Roughly speaking, the operation of engraving is performed by three different methods, viz. (I) By <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> graver which cuts the metal away; (2) by etching, in which the pattern is dissolved out in nitric acid; and (3) by machine, in which the pattern is simply indented.|$|E
25|$|However, the fervour of republicanism tailed {{off in the}} 1890s as {{the labour}} {{movement}} became concerned with the federation of Australia. The republican movement dwindled further during and after World War I. Emotionally, patriotic {{support for the war}} effort went hand in <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> renewal of loyalty to the monarchy. The Bulletin abandoned republicanism and became a conservative, Empire loyalist paper. The Returned and Services League formed in 1916 and became an important bastion of monarchist sentiment.|$|E
25|$|Inside was {{conceived}} {{as a kind of}} visual meditation. The work was developed along two parallel trains of thought.

And on the other, an interest {{in the form of the}} artwork itself — in how a single motif can become a kind of latent narrative through its repetition and multiplication (like on ancient Greek Geometric vases and Eastern patterned carpets).|$|E
