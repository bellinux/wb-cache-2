40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{formulate}} a professional and scientific view on the social, ethical, and legal issues that impact on data storage and <b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> practices for biomedical research in Europe. Many aspects have been considered, such as the requirements for data storage and <b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> in the public and private sectors in Europe and the issues relating to <b>DNA</b> <b>banking,</b> that is to say the consent requirements for the banking and further uses of DNA samples, their control and ownership, and the return of benefit derived from DNA exploitation to the community. The methods comprise primarily the review of the existing professional guidelines, legal frameworks and other documents related to the data storage and <b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> practices in public and private sectors in Europe. Then, the issues related to <b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> were examined during an international workshop organized by the European Society of Human Genetics Public and Professional Policy Committee in Paris, France, 07 - 08, April, 2000. A total of 50 experts from 12 European countries attended this workshop. It came out that <b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> for medical and research purposes is indispensable. It facilitates the constitution of large collections, sharing of samples, multiple testing on the same samples, and repeating testing over the years. However, banking organization is complex, requires multiple actors, and concerns are expressed in various countries. International standardization of ethical requirements and policies with regard to <b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> has been recommended. Such standardization would facilitate a greater protection of individuals as well as future international cooperation in biomedical research. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a survey of 148 academically based and commercial DNA diagnostic labs regarding <b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> (defined as the storage of individual DNA samples in some form with identifiers for later retrieval). The population surveyed consisted of all laboratories listed with HELIX, a national directory of DNA diagnostic labs that includes a fairly comprehensive listing of clinical service labs as well as a large number of research labs. The survey was concerned primarily with the legal and ethical issues that the long-term storage of DNA may raise. The survey inquired into the respondents' policies and procedures concerning (1) the extent of <b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> and of interest in developing <b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> in academia and industry and (2) the degree to which <b>DNA</b> <b>banks</b> had developed written internal policies and/or a written depositor's agreement (a signed document defining the rights and obligations of the person from whom the sample was taken and the bank) designed to anticipate or prevent some of the ethical and legal problems that can arise from the long-term retention of DNA. Our research suggests that (1) the activity of <b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> is growing, particularly in the academic setting, and (2) most academically based <b>DNA</b> <b>banks</b> lack written internal policies, written depositor's agreements, or other relevant documentation regarding important aspects of this activity...|$|R

We constructed the <b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> of primary immunodeficiency disorders {{for the first time}} in Iran. The DNA of 31 immunodeficient patients and their families (total of 92 samples) were collected, as the first step for construction of <b>DNA</b> <b>banking.</b> <b>DNA</b> was isolated from whole blood by salting out method. Among our patients, Common variable immunodeficiency was the most common disorder, followed by X-linked agammaglobulinemia, Ataxia-telangiectasia, Chronic granulomatous disease, Severe combined immunodeficiency, Hyper IgM syndromes, and Leukocyte adhesion defects. <b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> is a useful method for further detection of mutation in immunodeficient patients and prenatal diagnosis for presence or absence of the disorder in the fetus which can be confirmed by molecular genetics testing...|$|R

Comparison of DNA samples allowed {{scientists}} to work on the Human Genome Project, which maps out many of the genes on human DNA. It has also {{led to the development of}} preventative genetics. Samples from the <b>DNA</b> <b>bank</b> have been used to identify patterns and determine which genes lead to specific disorders. Once people know which genes lead to disorders, people can take steps to lessen the effects of that disorder. This can occur through adjustments in lifestyle, as demonstrated in preventive healthcare, or even through gene therapy. DNA can be banked at any time during a person's life.|$|E

50|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> is {{the storage}} of DNA (typically {{extracted}} from white blood cells) for possible future use. Because {{it is likely that}} testing methodology and our understanding of genes, mutations, and diseases will improve in the future, consideration should be given to <b>banking</b> <b>DNA</b> of affected individuals. <b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> is particularly relevant in situations in which molecular genetic testing is available on a research basis only. No laboratories offering molecular genetic testing for prenatal diagnosis of 3-M syndrome are listed in the GeneTests Laboratory Directory. However, prenatal testing may be available for families in which the disease-causing mutations have been identified in an affected family member in a research or clinical laboratory.|$|R
5000|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>banking</b> is the secure, {{long term}} storage of an individual’s genetic material.

Analyzing an individual's DNA can allow scientists to predict genetic disorders, as used in preventative genetics or gene therapy, and prove that person's identity, as used {{in the criminal justice}} system. There are multiple methods for testing and analyzing genetic information including restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and polymerase chain reactions (PCR).|$|R

Due to the great number of ethnic Tibetan victims in the quake, local clergy from monasteries said that the traditional sky burial funeral rites would be too difficult to manage, and that the unsanitary conditions meant that {{the souls of the}} departed may not reach heaven. A local monk said that it was determined a mass cremation, presided over by local Buddhist monks, would be the most appropriate funeral rite for the victims. The Qinghai provincial Department of Civil Affairs sent out directives that funeral customs for local ethnic minorities must be respected, that the victims themselves must be treated with respect, and for a <b>DNA</b> <b>bank</b> to be set up for bodies who have not yet been identified.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{analysis}} of hundreds of semi-feral African village dogs conducted by Cornell University, {{it was found that}} dogs from most regions of Africa are genetically distinct from both non-native breeds and mixed-breed dogs. The Village Dog Genetic Diversity Project, field researchers from the University of California, Davis, local veterinarians, and others sampled 318 African village dogs from Uganda, Egypt, and Namibia. There were some exceptions to the diversity in Namibia and Giza, which it was theorized was a result of European colonization or proximity to Eurasia. They then looked at various breed and mixed-breed dogs and sent various physical information and blood samples to the Canine <b>DNA</b> <b>Bank</b> at the Baker Institute for Animal Health at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. It was then discovered that African village dogs are [...] "a mosaic of" [...] indigenous dogs and non-native mixed-breed dogs. The African village dog was about as closely related to the modern domestic dog as it was to the gray wolf. Another reason the African village dogs {{have been found to be}} more genetically diverse is the lack of strict breeding, which narrows breeds' gene pools.|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} {{and scope of}} human genetic banking has increased significantly {{in recent years and}} is set to expand still further. Two of the major growth areas in medical research, pharmacogenomics and population genetics, rely on large <b>DNA</b> <b>banks</b> to provide extensive, centralised and standardised genetic information as well as clinical and personal data. This development raises ethical concerns. Our article focuses on the appropriateness of informed consent as a means to safeguard both research subjects’ rights and their good will. It will be argued that information requirements are extensive, with regard to non-therapeutic research, feedback, type of consent and possible breaches of confidentiality as well as possible implications for third parties. Given the demand of these requirements and the danger that research facilitated by these huge <b>DNA</b> <b>banks</b> may not reflect public priorities, it is argued that the research needs be steered by trustees to ensure that the altruistic act of sample donation contributes to the public good...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores some {{features}} {{of the relationship between}} power and knowledge as it is currently taking shape in the discourse and practice of forensic <b>DNA</b> data <b>banking</b> and addresses the limits of the existing theoretical discourse on power in capturing the kind of power effects that are emerging. The first chapter explores the social, political and historical context in which forensic <b>DNA</b> data <b>banking</b> has emerged. The second chapter examines relevant socio-cultural transformations in the nature of power that have been taking place since the Nineteenth Century, bringing together Foucault's concept of surveillance with more recent analysis of surveillance that suggests, that as a technology of power, surveillance {{is in the process of}} changing. Risk is considered as a major force in shaping surveillance practice and discourse, specifically its influence on crime control strategies is discussed. Chapter three first contends that modern themes, which were instrumental in legitimating the development of older identification technologies, continue to play a central role in the discourse legitimating the use of <b>DNA</b> data <b>banking.</b> It also reveals that <b>DNA</b> data <b>banking</b> is premised on an ambivalent notion of crime and 'criminality'. Foucault's theory on bio-power and Baudrillard's simulation theory are considered and it is suggested that these theoretical perspectives can elucidate the relationship between <b>DNA</b> data <b>banking</b> and the changing nature of power...|$|R

40|$|Italy {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{producers}} of extra-virgin olive oil and there is a rich assortment of olive cultivars, 395, registered in the national list. Due to its typicality, part of the italian production has the qualification of protected designation of origin (PDO) mark. In PDO oils, the traceability of cultivars is essential to fulfill varietal requirements. The aim of this work was to set up a <b>DNA</b> <b>bank</b> of Olea europaea L. with the objective of cultivar traceability in olive oil. For this purpose 75 cultivars were collected from five distinct collections and used for DNA extraction by means of a commercial kit, as well as via a modified phenol-chloroform protocol, set up by the authors. Then, DNA was lyophilized to constitute the <b>DNA</b> <b>bank,</b> being subsequently used as reference. A technique for DNA immobilization in a solid matrix was also tested, and a limited number of these cultivars was used for monovarietal oil production by a pilot plant and the obtained oil was used to prove the suitability of microsatellite amplification, not only in the case of the analysis of leaves, but also directly on the final product. The electrophoretic profiles of leaves from the <b>DNA</b> <b>bank</b> corresponded to the monovarietal oil of the same cultivar...|$|E
40|$|The {{conservation}} of {{plant genetic resources}} is important and {{it is essential that}} many diverse methods are adopted including maintenance in natural conditions and representation in ex-situ collections. DNA Banks store extracted plant genomic DNA which is made available to researchers for phylogenetics, phylogeographics, population studies, gene discovery, pre-emptive breeding and marker development. The establishment of DNA banks facilitates high through put analysis of plant genomes by making widely available DNA from large numbers of plant accessions. The Australian Plant <b>DNA</b> <b>Bank</b> {{is an example of a}} plant <b>DNA</b> <b>Bank</b> which aims to preserve representative genetic information from the Australian flora and cultivated species. Information regarding the species in this collection is available via the World Wide Web (www. dnabank. com. au). In this collection DNA from all individuals from rare species and species of economic importance are also being stored. There is a requirement for DNA banks to develop appropriate policies for access and benefit sharing and tools for automating sample and data handling. International networking of DNA banks will be a key step in linking genomics tools to global pant diversity and ensuring that the protocols are standardised. The operations, technical issues, and benefits of a plant <b>DNA</b> <b>bank</b> will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|In {{times of}} {{increasing}} numbers of methods and tools for the molecular identification of organisms, {{it is inevitable that}} researchers have to deal with an additional flood of samples: the extracted DNA of organisms which are in the researcher’s focus. Today, voucher specimens – the specimens from which DNA was extracted – have to be placed in adequate biological collections and organisms’ sequence data can officially be deposited in online databases such as Genbank, often a prerequisite for publication of results in peer-reviewed journals. DNA extracts do not underlie such rules, but adequate housing of DNA extracts, especially of rare or difficult to obtain species, will be a major task in the near future. The <b>DNA</b> <b>Bank</b> Network bridges the gap between natural history collections and molecular sequence databases by providing online references to analysed specimens and inferred molecular data. DNA samples are linked to their respective vouchers and inferred molecular data are stored in public sequence databases, facilitating taxonomic verification of molecularly analysed organisms. We provide the opportunity for long-term storage of DNA in the <b>DNA</b> <b>Bank</b> Network, giving other reseachers the opportunity to access DNA for further projects dealing with the same organisms. In this way, multiple sampling can be avoided and there is a direct link between the three main sources of information, i. e. the sampled organism, the DNA, and the sequence data. Here we present the functioning and layout of the <b>DNA</b> <b>Bank</b> Network, which currently connects DNA banks of four research museums in Germany: the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology (ZSM), the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin-Dahlem (BGBM), the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures Braunschweig (DSMZ), and the Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig (ZMFK).
