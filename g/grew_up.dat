40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{describes}} some concepts {{which are}} important {{for the creation of}} autonomous agents capable of <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> <b>Growing</b> <b>up</b> means that living systems, starting from a pre-structured set of functions, develop competence to better adapt to the environment all life long, from childhood to maturity. A living artefact <b>grows</b> <b>up</b> when its capabilities, abilities/knowledge, shift to a further level of complexity, i. e. the complexity rank of its internal capabilities performs a step forward. We want to define an architecture containing mechanisms which play the same role for autonomous agents as the mechanisms that make humans so successful [1]. In the attempt to define an architecture for autonomous <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> agents, we have been investigating the abstraction process in children as natural parts of a cognitive system. We studied deliberative and non-deliberative (emergent) mental adaptive and <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> mechanisms. A list of functional requirements based on these concepts is then proposed. Key-Words:- <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> living artifacts, abstraction mechanisms, intelligent architecture, adaptable agents, epigenetic robotics...|$|R
