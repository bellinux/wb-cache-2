5|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have historically}} been proposed for the variation seen in the skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs. Brown and Schlaikjer suggested that there was sexual dimorphism {{in the degree of}} <b>doming,</b> and hypothesized that flat-headed specimens such as AMNH5450 (Ornatotholus) represented the female morph of Stegoceras. This idea was supported by a 1981 morphometric study by Champan and colleagues, which found that males had larger and thicker domes. After other flat-headed pachycephalosaurs were discovered, the degree of <b>doming</b> was proposed to be a feature with taxonomic importance, and AMNH5450 was therefore considered a distinct taxon from 1979 onwards. In 1998, Goodwin and colleagues instead proposed that the inflation of the dome was an ontogenetic feature that changed with age, based on a histological study of an S. validum skull that showed the dome consisted of vascular, fast-growing bone, consistent with an increase in <b>doming</b> through age. These authors found that the supposedly distinct features of Ornatotholus could easily be the results of ontogeny.|$|E
25|$|An earlier gold event 2660-2655 Ma was {{associated}} with major extension (normal faulting and granite <b>doming)</b> resulting {{in the formation of}} late basins and the intrusion of mantle-derived magmas (syenites and Mafic-type granites/porphyries) and tight anticlockwise PTt paths.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, if unreduced {{superior}} fenestrae are morphologically primitive, then Dracorex is {{more primitive}} in the temporal region {{than any other}} known pachycephalosaur. However, Sullivan (2003, 2006) demonstrated that the oldest known pachycephalosaurs were, in fact, fully domed, and that the flat-headed morphology appeared later in the fossil record. This suggests that <b>doming</b> may be primitive for pachycephalosaurs and that a reversion to the non-domed, flat-headed state is a secondary (derived) character reversion, coupled with the re-opening of the supratemporal fenestrae. Indeed, while Stegoceras has been considered to be transitional between domed and flat-headed taxa, it may indicate {{the beginning of a}} character reversion to suppression of <b>doming</b> and opening of the supratemporal fenestrae in some taxa.|$|E
25|$|In the {{particular}} example of Sardar-e Bozorg ab anbar in Qazvin, the storage space was built {{so large that}} it {{became known as the}} largest single domed ab anbar of Iran. <b>Doming</b> the square plan was not an easy task, yet dome construction was not something new to these architects as is evident from the numerous domed masterpieces such as Soltaniyeh.|$|E
25|$|Two {{separate}} {{periods of}} Whin dolerite injection are confirmed by studies of vitrinite reflectance over the Alston Block where two periods of Whin contact metamorphism have been recognized. The two periods of Whin dolerite emplacement {{form part of}} the end-Carboniferous earth movements in northern England. They can be shown to have occurred between a period of compression from a W-SW direction and later gentle <b>doming</b> of the Alston Block near the Westphalian-Stephanian boundary, dated about 300-295 Ma.|$|E
25|$|It has {{generally}} been accepted that tectonic plates are able to move because of the relative density of oceanic lithosphere and the relative weakness of the asthenosphere. Dissipation of heat from the mantle is acknowledged to be the original source of the energy required to drive plate tectonics through convection or large scale upwelling and <b>doming.</b> The current view, though still {{a matter of some}} debate, asserts that as a consequence, a powerful source of plate motion is generated due to the excess density of the oceanic lithosphere sinking in subduction zones. When the new crust forms at mid-ocean ridges, this oceanic lithosphere is initially less dense than the underlying asthenosphere, but it becomes denser with age as it conductively cools and thickens. The greater density of old lithosphere relative to the underlying asthenosphere allows it to sink into the deep mantle at subduction zones, providing most of the driving force for plate movement. The weakness of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction zone. Although subduction is thought to be the strongest force driving plate motions, it cannot be the only force since there are plates such as the North American Plate which are moving, yet are nowhere being subducted. The same is true for the enormous Eurasian Plate. The sources of plate motion are a matter of intensive research and discussion among scientists. One of the main points is that the kinematic pattern of the movement itself should be separated clearly from the possible geodynamic mechanism that is invoked as the driving force of the observed movement, as some patterns may be explained by more than one mechanism. In short, the driving forces advocated at the moment can be divided into three categories based on the relationship to the movement: mantle dynamics related, gravity related (mostly secondary forces), and earth rotation related.|$|E

500|$|The {{skull of}} Stegoceras can be {{distinguished}} from those of other pachycephalosaurs by features such as its pronounced parietosquamosal shelf (though this became smaller with age), the [...] "incipient" [...] <b>doming</b> of its frontopariental (though the <b>doming</b> increased with age), its inflated nasal bones, its ornamentation of tubercles on the sides and back of the squamosal bones, rows of up to six tubercles on the upper side of each squamosal, and up to two nodes on the backwards projection of the parietal. It is also distinct in its lack of nasal ornamentation, and in having a reduced diastema. The skull of S. novomexicanum {{can be distinguished}} from that of S. validum in features such as the backwards extension of the parietal bone being more reduced and triangular, having larger supratemporal fenestrae (though {{this may be due}} to the specimens being juveniles), and having roughly parallel suture contacts between the squamosal and parietal. It also appears to have had a smaller frontal boss than S. validum. It also seems to have been more gracile overall.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 21st century, few pachycephalosaur genera were known from postcranial remains, and many taxa were only known from domes, which made {{classification}} {{within the group}} difficult. Pachycephalosaurs are thus mainly defined by cranial features, such as the flat to domed frontoparietal, the broad and flattened bar along the postorbital and squamosal bones, and the squamosal bones being deep plates on the occiput. In 1986, Sereno had divided the pachycephalosaurs into different groups based {{on the extent of}} the <b>doming</b> of their skulls (grouped in now invalid taxa such as [...] "Tholocephalidae" [...] and [...] "Domocephalinae"), and in 2000 he considered the [...] "partially" [...] domed Stegoceras a transition between the supposedly [...] "primitive" [...] flat-headed and advanced [...] "fully" [...] domed genera (such as Pachycephalosaurus). The dome-headed/flat-headed division of the pachycephalosaurs was abandoned in the following years, as flat heads were considered paedomorphic (juvenile-like) or derived traits in most revisions, but not a sexually dimorphic trait. In 2006, Sullivan argued against the idea that the extent of <b>doming</b> was useful in determining taxonomic affinities between pachycephalosaurs. In 2003, Sullivan found Stegoceras itself to be more basal (or [...] "primitive") than the [...] "fully-domed" [...] members of the subfamily Pachycephalosaurinae, elaborating on conclusions reached by Sereno in 1986.|$|E
500|$|Extensive tectonic uplift {{occurred}} at Level Mountain and {{elsewhere on the}} Stikine Plateau during the Neogene period [...] This resulted in dissection of the plateau surface by stream erosion which varies greatly across the region. The youthful V-shaped gorges along the lava plateau margin are signs of continuing uplift at Level Mountain, which may in part be caused by <b>doming</b> of the massif during volcanism. Several outcrops of alkali basalt are present south of Kennicott Lake and the Tahltan River. These are comparable in age to the Level Mountain shield volcano and may represent erosional remnants of this structure.|$|E
500|$|In {{extensive}} {{regions of}} the Slave province of northern Canada, the magma that later became batholiths heated the surrounding rock to create metamorphic regions called aureoles about 2,575million years ago. These regions are typically [...] wide. The creation of aureoles was a continuous process, but three recognizable metamorphic phases can be correlated with established deformational phases. The cycle began with a deformation phase unaccompanied by metamorphism. This evolved into the second phase accompanied by broad regional metamorphism as thermal <b>doming</b> began. With continued updoming of the isotherms, the third phase produced minor folding but caused major metamorphic recrystallization, resulting in the emplacement of granite {{at the core of}} the thermal dome. This phase occurred at lower pressure because of erosional unloading, but the temperatures were more extreme, ranging up to about [...] With deformation complete, the thermal dome decayed; minor mineralogical changes occurred during this decay phase. The region has since been effectively stable.|$|E
500|$|The {{biogeography}} {{and early}} evolutionary history of pachycephalosaurs is poorly understood, {{and can only}} be clarified by new discoveries. Pachycephalosaurs appear abruptly in the fossil record, and are present in both North America and Asia, so it is unknown when they first originated, and from which direction they dispersed. The oldest known {{members of the group}} (such as Acrotholus) are [...] "fully domed" [...] and known from the Santonian stage of the Late Cretaceous period (about 84 million years ago). This is before the supposedly more primitive Stegoceras from the Middle Campanian (77 million years ago) and Homalocephale from the Early Maastrichtian (70 million years ago), so the <b>doming</b> of the skull may be a homoplastic trait (a form of convergent evolution). The late occurrence of pachycephalosaurs compared to the related ceratopsians indicates a long ghost lineage (inferred, but missing from the fossil record) spanning 66 million years, from the Late Jurassic to the Cretaceous. Since pachycephalosaurs were mainly small, {{this may be due to}} taphonomic bias; smaller animals are less likely to be preserved through fossilisation. More delicate bones are also less likely to be preserved, which is why pachycephalosaurs are mainly known from their robust skulls.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the theory}} of plume {{tectonics}} developed during the 1990s, a modified concept of mantle convection currents is used. It asserts that super plumes rise from the deeper mantle and are the drivers or substitutes of the major convection cells. These ideas, which find their roots in the early 1930s with the so-called [...] "fixistic" [...] ideas of the European and Russian Earth Science Schools, find resonance in the modern theories which envisage hot spots or mantle plumes which remain fixed and are overridden by oceanic and continental lithosphere plates over time and leave their traces in the geological record (though these phenomena are not invoked as real driving mechanisms, but rather as modulators). Modern theories that continue building on the older mantle <b>doming</b> concepts and see plate movements as a secondary phenomena are {{beyond the scope of}} this page and are discussed elsewhere (for example on the Plume tectonics page).|$|E
2500|$|The roughly {{trapezoidal}} {{island is}} formed by a complex volcano immediately {{southwest of the}} Campi Flegrei area at {{the western side of}} the Bay of Naples. The eruption of the trachytic Green Tuff ignimbrite about 56,000years ago was followed by caldera formation. The highest point of the island, Monte Epomeo (788m), is a volcanic horst consisting of a Green Tuff ignimbrite deposit that was submerged after its eruption and then uplifted. Volcanism on the island has been significantly affected by tectonism that formed a series of horsts and grabens; at least [...] of uplift has formed as a result of resurgent <b>doming</b> during the past 33,000years. Many small monogenetic volcanoes were formed around the uplifted block. Volcanism during the Holocene produced a series of pumiceous tephras, tuff rings, lava domes, and lava flows. The latest eruption of Ischia, in 1302, produced a spatter cone and the Arso lava flow, which reached the NE coast.|$|E
