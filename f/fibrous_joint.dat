50|$|A {{gomphosis}} is {{a specialized}} <b>fibrous</b> <b>joint</b> {{in which a}} conical process or peg of one bone fits into a hole or socket in another bone.(gomphos is a Greek word meaning bolt). Small quantity of fibrous tissue holds the bones together.No movement is possible at such peg-and-socket joints.|$|E
5000|$|Cartilaginous joints are {{connected}} entirely by cartilage (fibrocartilage or hyaline). [...] Cartilaginous joints allow more movement between bones than a <b>fibrous</b> <b>joint</b> {{but less than}} the highly mobile synovial joint. Cartilaginous joints also forms the growth regions of immature long bones and the intervertebral discs of the spinal column.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>fibrous</b> <b>joints</b> {{are also}} called [...] "fixed" [...] or [...] "immovable", {{because they do}} not move. These joints have no joint cavity and are {{connected}} via fibrous connective tissue.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fibrous</b> <b>joints</b> are {{connected}} by dense connective tissue, consisting mainly of collagen. These are fixed joints where bones are united by {{a layer of}} white fibrous tissue of varying thickness. In the skull the joints between the bones are called sutures.

50|$|Cephalic {{disorders}} {{are not necessarily}} caused by a single factor, but {{may be influenced by}} hereditary or genetic conditions, nutritional deficiencies, or by environmental exposures during pregnancy, such as medication taken by the mother, maternal infection, or exposure to radiation. Some cephalic disorders occur when the cranial sutures (the <b>fibrous</b> <b>joints</b> that connect the bones of the skull) join prematurely. Most cephalic {{disorders are}} caused by a disturbance that occurs very early {{in the development of the}} fetal nervous system.|$|R
5000|$|The parietal bones [...] are two {{bones in}} the human skull which, when joined {{together}} at a <b>fibrous</b> <b>joint,</b> form the sides and roof of the cranium. Each bone is roughly quadrilateral in form, and has two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. It is named from the Latin paries (-ietis), wall.|$|E
5000|$|Hyaline {{cartilage}} {{is covered}} externally by a fibrous membrane, called the perichondrium i.e. ears and nose, and {{also at the}} articular ends of bones where it is internal to the joint cavity which is defined by a <b>fibrous</b> <b>joint</b> capsule lined with synovium) [...] This membrane, perichondrium or synovium, contains vessels that provide the cartilage with nutrition through diffusion.|$|E
50|$|In newborns {{and young}} (especially slender) infants, {{the tip of}} the xiphoid process may be both seen and felt as a lump just below the sternal notch. By age 15 to 29, the xiphoid usually fuses to the body of the sternum with a <b>fibrous</b> <b>joint.</b> Unlike the {{synovial}} articulation of major joints, this is non-movable. Ossification of the xiphoid process occurs around age 40.|$|E
2500|$|Craniosynostosis – Much less common, but {{potentially}} {{much more serious}} than plagiocephaly is craniosynostosis. Craniosynostosis is a congenital abnormality originating from {{the central nervous system}} in which {{one or more of the}} <b>fibrous</b> <b>joints</b> in the skull close [...] prematurely. This fusion often requires surgical intervention to reconstruct the skull (see craniofacial surgery) either to bring it back to its normal position or to give it a more natural shape. It is believed that craniosynostosis occurs in 1 out of 1,800 to 2,200 live births, and is often a side effect of an associated syndrome.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Craniosynostosis, a {{disorder}} {{in which one}} or more <b>fibrous</b> <b>joints</b> of the skull fuse prematurely, causes skull mal-formation and {{may be associated with}} increased intracranial pressure and developmental delays. In order to perform medical research studies that relate phenotypic abnormalities to outcomes such as cognitive ability or results of surgery, biomedical re-searchers need an automated methodology for quantifying the degree of abnormality of the disorder. This paper addresses that need by proposing a set of features derived from CT scans of the skull {{that can be used for}} this purpose. A thorough set of experiments is used to evaluate the features as compared to two human craniofacial experts in a ranking evaluation. I...|$|R
50|$|The frontal suture is a <b>fibrous</b> <b>joint</b> {{that divides}} {{the two halves}} of the frontal bone of the skull in infants and children. Typically, it {{completely}} fuses between 3 and 9 months of age, with {{the two halves of}} the frontal bone being fused together. It is also called the metopic suture, although this term may also refer specifically to a persistent frontal suture (further detailed in section below).|$|E
50|$|A {{synovial}} joint, {{also known}} as diarthrosis, joins bones with a <b>fibrous</b> <b>joint</b> capsule that is continuous with the periosteum of the joined bones, constitutes the outer boundary of a synovial cavity, and surrounds the bones' articulating surfaces. The synovial cavity/joint is filled with synovial fluid. The joint capsule {{is made up of}} an outer layer, the articular capsule, which keeps the bones together structurally, and an inner layer, the synovial membrane, which seals in the synovial fluid.|$|E
5000|$|A syndesmosis is a {{slightly}} movable <b>fibrous</b> <b>joint</b> in which bones {{such as the}} tibia and fibula are joined together by connective tissue. Examples include the distal tibiofibular joint {{as well as the}} radioulnar joint. Injuries to the ankle syndesmosis are commonly known as a [...] "high ankle sprain". Although the syndesmosis is a joint, in the literature the term syndesmotic injury is used to describe injury of the syndesmotic ligaments. It comes from the Greek σύν, syn (meaning [...] "with") and δεσμός, desmos (meaning [...] "a band"). Syndesmosis sprains have received increasing recognition during recent years because of a heightened awareness of the mechanism, symptoms, and signs of injury.|$|E
50|$|The {{syndrome}} {{was first}} reported in an eight-year-old boy, {{but very few}} cases have been reported since then. The syndrome is detected by abnormalities noted at birth involving the head, limbs, heart, ears, and skin. It is characterized by premature closure of the <b>fibrous</b> <b>joints</b> between certain bones of the skull in {{a process known as}} craniosynostosis. As documented in the first case, the victim tends to suffer from cyanosis and other respiratory and breathing infections, all before the age of one. Body development subsequently slows down, but some problems can be fixed under proper guidance, such as learning to walk with special crutches by five years of age. Craniofacial problems are present that have no effect on the patient's intelligence and mental growth.|$|R
5000|$|The joint {{between the}} index {{metacarpal}} and the capitate is a <b>fibrous</b> non-mobile <b>joint.</b> Some {{people have a}} gene that leads to this growth.

40|$|The {{coordinate}} {{growth of}} the brain and skull is achieved through a series of interactions between the developing brain, the growing bones of the skull, and the <b>fibrous</b> <b>joints,</b> or sutures, that unite the bones. These interactions couple the expansion of the brain to the {{growth of the}} bony plates at the sutures. Craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of the bones of the skull, is a common birth defect (1 in 3000 live births) that disrupts coordinate growth and often results in profoundly abnormal skull shape. Individuals affected with Boston-type craniosynostosis, an autosomal dominant disorder, bear a mutated copy of MSX 2, a homeobox gene thought to function in tissue interactions. Here we show that expression of the mouse counterpart of this mutant gene in the developing skulls of transgenic mice causes craniosynostosis and ectopic cranial bone. These mice provide a transgenic model of craniosynostosis as well as a point of entry into the molecular mechanisms that coordinate the growth {{of the brain and}} skull...|$|R
5000|$|Brachycephaly (from Greek roots meaning [...] "short" [...] and [...] "head") is {{the shape}} of a skull shorter than typical for its species. It is {{perceived}} as a desirable trait in some domesticated dog and cat breeds, such as Pugs, and can be normal or abnormal in other animal species. In humans, the cephalic disorder is known as flat head syndrome, and results from premature fusion of the coronal sutures (see craniosynostosis) or from external deformation (see plagiocephaly). The coronal suture is the <b>fibrous</b> <b>joint</b> that unites the frontal bone with the two parietal bones of the skull. The parietal bones form the top and sides of the skull. This feature can be seen in Down syndrome.|$|E
50|$|A joint or {{articulation}} (or articular surface) is {{the connection}} made between {{bones in the}} body which link the skeletal system into a functional whole. They are constructed to allow for different degrees and types of movement. Some joints, such as the knee, elbow, and shoulder, are self-lubricating, almost frictionless, {{and are able to}} withstand compression and maintain heavy loads while still executing smooth and precise movements. Other joints such as sutures between the bones of the skull permit very little movement (only during birth) {{in order to protect the}} brain and the sense organs. The connection between a tooth and the jawbone is also called a joint, and is described as a <b>fibrous</b> <b>joint</b> known as a gomphosis. Joints are classified both structurally and functionally.|$|E

5000|$|The lambdoid suture (or lambdoidal suture) is a dense, <b>fibrous</b> {{connective}} tissue <b>joint</b> on the posterior {{aspect of the}} skull that connects the parietal bones with the occipital bone. It is continuous with the occipitomastoid suture.|$|R
50|$|The coronal suture is a dense, <b>fibrous</b> {{connective}} tissue <b>joint</b> {{that separates the}} frontal and parietal bones of the skull. At birth, {{the bones of the}} skull do not meet. Coronal suture is present front side(frontal bone).|$|R
40|$|Skull sutures are <b>fibrous</b> <b>joints</b> {{between the}} {{different}} bones of the skull. In adult life they have no function but in the foetus they allow the bones to move during the birth process and are involved in skull growth till {{the age of six}} years. After the age of six years skull growth takes place by apposition of bone at the outer site of the skull and resorption of bone on the inner site of the skull. Craniosynostosis is a condition in which one or more sutures of the skull prematurely fuse. The term craniosynostosis was first used by Otto in 1830. 1 The word “Cranio” refers to cranium, “Syn” to together and “ostosis” to the genesis of bone. But the first description of craniosynostosis dates back to Hippocrates and Galen 2 and it is a disorder that occurs in the human species since ancient times. 3 When craniosynostosis is caused by a mutation or deletion we speak of syndromic craniosynostosis. This is the case in at least 20 % of the patients with craniosynostosis. 4 The most prevalent syndromes are Apert, Crouzon, Muenke and Saethre-Chotzen...|$|R
5000|$|The tibia [...] (plural tibiae [...] or tibias), {{also known}} as the shinbone or shankbone, is the larger and {{stronger}} of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates (the other being the fibula), and it connects the knee with the ankle bones. The tibia is found on the medial side of the leg next to the fibula and closer to the median plane or centre-line. The tibia is connected to the fibula by the interosseous membrane of the leg, forming a type of <b>fibrous</b> <b>joint</b> called a syndesmosis with very little movement. The tibia is named for the flute tibia. It is the second largest bone in the human body next to the femur. The leg bones are the strongest long bones as they support the rest of the body.|$|E
5000|$|A suture {{is a type}} of <b>fibrous</b> <b>joint</b> that is {{only found}} in the skull. The bones are bound {{together}} by Sharpey's fibres. A tiny amount of movement is permitted at sutures, which contributes to the compliance and elasticity of the skull.These joints are synarthroses. It is normal for many of the bones of the skull to remain unfused at birth. The fusion of the skull's bones at birth is known as craniosynostosis. The term [...] "fontanelle" [...] is used to describe the resulting [...] "soft spots". The relative positions of the bones continue to change during the life of the adult (though less rapidly), which can provide useful information in forensics and archaeology. In old age, cranial sutures may ossify (turn to bone) completely.The joints between the teeth (gomphoses) and the joint between the mandible and the cranium, the temporomandibular joint, form the only non-sutured joints in the skull.|$|E
50|$|The hip is {{essentially}} a ball and socket joint. It consists {{of the head of}} the femur (the ball) and the acetabulum (the socket). Both the ball and socket are congruous and covered with hyaline (or articular) cartilage, which allows smooth, almost frictionless gliding between the two surfaces. The edge of the acetabulum is surrounded by the acetabular labrum, a fibrous structure that envelops the femoral head. (See fig. 1) The labrum acts as a seal, or gasket, around the femoral head. However, this is not its only function, as it has been shown to contain nerve endings, which may cause pain if damaged. The blood supply of the labrum has also been demonstrated. The joint itself is encompassed by a thick, <b>fibrous</b> <b>joint</b> capsule, which is lined by synovium. The ligaments that keep the hip joint in place are in fact, thickened areas of joint capsule, rather than distinct structures. The synovium generates fluid that lubricates the joint; in that fluid are the nutrients needed to keep the cartilage cells alive. A total of 27 muscles cross the hip joint, making it a very deep part of the body for arthroscopic access. This is one reason why hip arthroscopy can be quite technically demanding.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Craniosynostosis, a {{disorder}} {{in which one}} or more <b>fibrous</b> <b>joints</b> of the skull fuse prematurely, causes skull de-formity and is associated with increased intracranial pressure and developmental delays. Although clinicians can easily diag-nose craniosynostosis and can classify its type, being able to quantify the condition is an important problem in craniofacial research. While several papers have attempted this quantification through statistical models, the methods have not been intuitive to biomedical researchers and clinicians who want to use them. The goal of this work {{was to develop a}} general platform upon which new quantification measures could be developed and tested. The features reported in this paper were developed as basic shape measures, both single-valued and vector-valued, that are extracted from a single plane projection of the 3 D skull. This technique allows us to process images that would otherwise be eliminated in previous systems due to poor resolution, noise or imperfections on their CT scans. We test our new features on classification tasks and also compare their performance to previous research. In spite of its simplicity, the classification accuracy of our new features is significantly higher than previous results on head CT scan data from the same research studies. I...|$|R
