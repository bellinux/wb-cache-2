5|$|As at Oak Ridge, {{the most}} {{difficulty}} was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were pickled to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>presses,</b> and then capped using arc welding under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they {{were subjected to}} a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output {{of only a handful of}} canned slugs per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start Reactor B on schedule in August 1944.|$|E

30|$|Both {{windmill}} and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressed</b> oils {{have been}} used in the 19 th century. However, we preferred to use the water-washed windmill pressed oil above the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressed</b> oil for several reasons. Firstly, by using the windmill extraction method relative large amounts of linseed oil could be pressed at once; if we had used the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>press</b> at our disposal instead, the process would have been far more time consuming. Furthermore, the water-washed windmill oil has a somewhat lower quality—a higher acid value and a more yellow colour—than the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressed</b> oil, which is possibly what one might expect for a linseed oil produced in the 19 th century.|$|R
25|$|A forging press, {{often just}} called a press, {{is used for}} press forging. There are two main types: {{mechanical}} and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>presses.</b> Mechanical presses function by using cams, cranks and/or toggles to produce a preset (a predetermined force at a certain location in the stroke) and reproducible stroke. Due {{to the nature of}} this type of system, different forces are available at different stroke positions. Mechanical presses are faster than their hydraulic counterparts (up to 50 strokes per minute). Their capacities range from 3 to 160 MN (300 to 18,000 short tons-force). <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>presses</b> use fluid pressure and a piston to generate force. The advantages of a hydraulic press over a mechanical press are its flexibility and greater capacity. The disadvantages include a slower, larger, and costlier machine to operate.|$|E

25|$|By 1821 Hick was {{managing}} partner of the Union Foundry, that later became Rothwell, Hick and Rothwell. After Peter Rothwell's death on 2 August 1824, the company continued with Peter Rothwell Jr (1792–1849) as Rothwell, Hick & Co. They made stationary steam engines, (a number of which were featured by John Farey in the second volume of his Treatise on the Steam Engine, 1827) as well as general engineering products including cast iron dockyard cranes.

25|$|In the 1830s rolled T-shaped (or single-flanged T {{parallel}} rail) and I-shaped (or double-flanged T parallel or bullhead) rails were introduced; both required cast-iron {{chairs to}} support them.

The wooden keys were formed from oak, steam softened and then compressed with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>presses</b> and stored in a drying house. When inserted into the chair, exposure to the wet atmosphere caused the key to expand, firmly holding the rail. The wedge {{may be on the}} inside or outside of the rail.

25|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of the diamond anvil cell, static high-pressure apparatus required large <b>hydraulic</b> <b>presses</b> which weighed several tons and required large specialized laboratories.

In addition to being hard, diamonds have the advantage of being transparent to a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from infrared to gamma rays, with the exception of the far ultraviolet and soft X-rays. This makes the DAC a perfect device for spectroscopic experiments and for crystallographic studies using hard X-rays.|$|E

Another disadvantage from a time perspective but an advantage in other regards such as gentleness, is that by its nature pressing with a basket press is very slow.

The great workshops that had grown with the line were equipped with diverse and elaborate machines.

The permutations and combinations of the stores were multiplied. Some of the engines were old and already worn out. These broke down periodically.
