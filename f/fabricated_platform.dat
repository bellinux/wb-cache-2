The monolayers have been deposited by transferring the spread solution of Am-Si@ZnO stearic acid prepared in chloroform at the air-water interface, at optimized pressure (16 mN/m), concentration (10 mg/ml) and temperature (23 degrees C). The high-resolution transmission electron microscopic studies of the Am-Si@ZnO nanocomposite reveal that the nanoparticles have a microscopic structure comprising of hexagonal assemblies of ZnO with typical dimensions of 30 nm. The surface morphology of the LB multilayer observed by scanning electron microscopy shows uniform surface of the Am-Si@ZnO film in the nanometer range (< 80 nm). These electrodes have been utilized for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) detection by covalently immobilizing the amino-terminated oligonucleotide probe sequence via glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker. The response studies of these fabricated electrodes carried out using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy show that this Am-Si@ZnO LB film based nucleic acid sensor exhibits a linear response to complementary DNA (10 (- 6) - 10 (- 16) M) with a detection limit of 1 x 10 (- 16) M.

40|$|The {{development}} of biosensors {{for the detection}} of biomolecules recognition is an extremely important problem in life science and clinical diagnostics. Many researchers and bio-scientists around the world are looking to present a simple and cost-effective ultra-sensitive platform for the bio-sensing applications in order to detect protein-protein interaction, DNA hybridization, and antigen-antibody interaction. Microcantilever (MC) transducer is a well-known sensing mechanism for biosensing application. In this method, a surface-stress will be induced through the bimolecular recognition on the cantilever surface, which results in the MC deflection. The magnitude of deflection is related to the number of (or concentration of) biomolecules of interest that were immobilized on the MC's surface during the biosensing protocole. However, one of the main drawbacks of cantilever biosensors is the high amount of analytes (proteins, DNA, polypeptides, etc.) that are required for sensing experiments as the cantilever must be submerged in the analytes. In addition, the cantilever bending read-out system (that can be optical or electrical) has to be designed sensitive enough to make it possible to measure deflection in the range of a few nanometers. In order to move toward ultra-sensitive biomolecular detection, one way is to increase the read-out resolution which makes the system more complex and expensive. Another solution is to fabricate the MC from materials different from silicon with less stiffness. In addition, in order to reduce analytes consumption, integration of microfluidic systems with microcantilevers would be beneficial. Through this integration, both the volume of analytes and the time of response are reduced. This thesis reports a promising method towards ultra-sensitive biosensing by integration of microfluidic system into a polymeric microcantilever. The <b>fabricated</b> <b>platform</b> is referred as “Polymeric Suspended Microfluidics". In order to immobilize biomolecule of interest for the biosensing application inside the microfluidic system, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are integrated into the buried microfluidics by two different methods. The thesis also presents a novel 3 D micromixer in order to implement in-situ synthesis of AuNPs. The 3 D micromixer has been fabricated and tested for characterizing mixing performance. The results of biosensing shows significant improvement in the sensitivity of the proposed platform compared with the common silicon based MC biosensor. The results show the proposed integrated sensing platform achieved a detection limit of 2 ng/ml (100 pM) toward the growth hormones biosensing (Ag-Ab interaction detection). The results demonstrate a proof-of-principal for successful polymeric cantilever fabrication towards the next generation of cantilever-based biosensing mechanism which has high potential to enable femtomolar (fM) biomolecular recognition detection...|$|E

40|$|Islet {{transplantation}} {{has great}} potential in restoring normoglycemia in diabetic patients. However, current clinical islet transplantation {{is associated with}} high graft failure the reasons of which still remain obscure. It is noteworthy {{that the process of}} islet isolation exposes the islet to a variety of cellular stresses, including disruption of the cell-matrix relationship, an event associated with induction of apoptotic pathways. This may adversely affect islet viability and function leading to the observed failure of islet transplantation. The cell-matrix relationship, characterised by adhesion interactions between membrane integrin receptors and the extracellular matrix molecules at the nanoscale, is known to modulate cell survival and growth. The aim {{of this study is to}} present a unique method of fabricating large area artificial substrates with biomimetic nanoscale surface topography. The substrates were realised by thermal evaporation of tin on silicon wafers to form randomly assembled nano-islands. Using the nano-islands as masks, the wafers were plasma etched to transfer the pattern onto silicon. We then examined the hypothesis of whether beta-cell function and survival can be enhanced by optimized restoration of cell-matrix adhesion.

The properties of the nanomaterial are strongly dependent on the size, morphology, composition, and local molecular environment of the material, all of which can be controlled by material design and synthesis. A novel nanomaterial referred to as a gold nanobelt was synthesized and characterized. Gold nanobelts synthesized in cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and sodium dodecylsulfate and with sub- 100 nm rectangular cross sections were found to exhibit a strong transverse plasmon peak at visible wavelengths. Unlike larger diameter silver nanowires, these nanobelts exhibit sharp, tunable plasmon resonances similar to those of nanoparticles. The gold nanobelt crystal structure contains a mixture of face centered cubic and hexagonally close packed lattice phases that can be isolated and examined individually due to the unique nanobelt size and shape. The nanobelt synthesis is very sensitive to temperature which is likely due to the transition of the surfactant solution from wormlike micelles to spherical micelles.
