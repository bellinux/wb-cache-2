The bright spark at the electromotor, and {{the shock}} in the arms, {{appeared}} evidently {{to be due}} to one current in the long wire, divided into two parts by the <b>double</b> <b>channel</b> afforded through the body and through the electromotor; for that the spark was evolved at the place of disjunction with the electromotor, not by any direct action of the latter, but by a force immediately exerted in the wire of communication, seemed to be without doubt (1070.). It followed, therefore, that by using a better conductor in place of the human body, the whole of this extra current might be made to pass at that place; and thus be separated from that which the electromotor could produce by its immediate action, and its direction be examined apart from any interference of the original and originating current. This was found to be true; for on connecting the ends of the principal wire together by a cross wire two or three feet in length, applied just where the hands had felt the shock, the whole of the extra current passed by the new channel, and then no better spark than one producible by a short wire was obtained on disjunction at the electromotor.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{authors have}} {{proposed}} that wormhole routing in 2 D meshes be made fully adaptive by doubling the number of channels {{in one of the}} two dimensions. We examine this proposition both using a new model for designing adaptive routing algorithms and using simulations. The model involves analyzing the directions in which packets can turn in a network and the cycles that the turns can form. Breaking all of the cycles by prohibiting a minimum number of turns produces routing algorithms that are deadlock free and maximally adaptive. Applying the model to 2 D meshes shows that <b>doubling</b> the <b>channels</b> in one dimension is required for fully adaptive routing; <b>doubling</b> the <b>channels</b> in only one direction or two orthogonal directions is not sufficient. Applying the model to 2 D meshes with <b>double</b> <b>channels</b> in one dimension also produces a new, fully adaptive routing algorithm. This algorithm is more adaptive than the previous fully adaptive routing algorithm. Simulations of the fully adaptive routing [...] ...|$|R

According to the special characteristics of the <b>double</b> <b>channel</b> pump, there exist a great amount of poor-quality elements, most of which are so called Sliver elements, generated by the tetrahedral mesh generation algorithms of Advancing Front Technique (AFT) and Delaunay Triangulation.

Then this method was combined with advanced optimization-based smoothing, Laplacian smoothing and swapping optimization to optimize the tetrahedral mesh. The computer language C++ is applied to develop the algorithms. Computational experiments of a <b>double</b> <b>channel</b> pump shown that the worst elements can be removed and the whole quality can be improved noticeably.
