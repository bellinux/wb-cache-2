40|$|Few {{issues in}} swine {{production}} are {{as complex as}} floor space allowances. One method for pork producers to calculate floor space allowance (A) is to convert BW into a 2 -dimensional concept yielding an expression of A = k * BW 0. 667. Data on ADG, ADFI, and G:F were obtained from published peer-reviewed studies. Five data sets were created: A = grower-finisher pigs, <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> and consistent group size; B = grower-finisher pigs and <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> (group size {{did not need to}} be consistent); C = grower-finisher pigs, partially <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> and consistent group size; D = grower-finisher pigs, partially <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> (group size {{did not need to be}} consistent); and E = nursery pigs, <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> or woven wire floors (group size did not need to be consistent). Each data set was analyzed using a broken-line analysis and a linear regression. For the broken-line analyses, the critical k value, below which a decrease in ADG occurred, varied from 0. 0317 to 0. 0348. In all cases the effect of space allowance on ADG was significant (P < 0. 05). Using the linear analyses based on data with k values of 0. 10); however, none of the linear regressions explained a significant proportion of the variation in ADG. The slopes for the nonplateau portion of the broken-line analyses based on percent values varied among data sets. For every 0. 001 decrease in k (approximately 3 % of the critical k value), ADG decreased by 0. 56 to 1. 41 %, with an average value of 0. 98 % for the 5 %-based analyses. The use of an allometric approach to express space allowance and broken-line analysis to establish space requirements seem to be useful tools for pig production. The critical k value at which crowding becomes detrimental to the growth of the pig is similar in full- and partial-slat systems and in nursery and grower-finisher stages. The critical point for crowding determined in these analyses approximated current recommendations to ensure the welfare of pigs...|$|R
40|$|To address odour and gas {{problems}} {{generated by}} livestock facilities, air dispersion {{models have been}} used to determine reasonable science-based setback distances between the livestock operations and the neighbouring residences. However, none of the existing models consider diurnal, seasonal and climate variations of odour and gas (ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide) concentrations and emission rates (OGCER), which may result in great uncertainties in setback distance calculations. Thus, the purpose of this project was to monitor and model diurnal and seasonal OGCER from swine grower/finisher rooms. Specifically, this research was conducted to: 1) characterize diurnal OGCER between two different flooring systems (<b>fully</b> and partially <b>slatted</b> floorings) under three different weather conditions (August, October and February); 2) identify seasonal OGCER over a 12 -month measuring period; and 3) develop mathematical models to predict the OGCER. A two-factorial strip-block experiment was designed for measuring diurnal OGCER in two grower/finisher rooms. It was found that: 1) the diurnal OGCER in the <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>flooring</b> system was 27. 6 to 39. 5 % higher than that in the partially <b>slatted</b> <b>flooring</b> system; however, no significant differences in the diurnal OGCER were found between the two rooms, except for the NH 3 concentrations in August, the NH 3 and H 2 S concentrations and emissions in October, and odour concentrations and emissions in February (P > 0. 05), and 2) significant diurnal variations in the OGCER (except for the odour concentrations and H 2 S emissions) have been observed in August (P 0. 05). A repeated measurement method was used to monitor seasonal OGCER in four grower/finisher rooms over a period of 12 months. It was found that: 1) the seasonal OGCER from the <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>flooring</b> system was 2. 9 to 40. 6 % higher than that from the partially <b>slatted</b> <b>flooring</b> system; however, the seasonal OGCER (except for the NH 3 concentrations in October, November and January; the CO 2 concentrations in August and the CO 2 emissions in December) between the two different floors for each measuring month did not differ significantly (P > 0. 05); and 2) the seasonal OGCER was significantly affected by the sampling month (P < 0. 05), and no specific seasonal pattern was observed. The statistical models developed for each type of the flooring system determined the OGCER based on the room and ambient temperatures, the ventilation rates and the animal units. The predicted results showed good agreement with measured values for most of OGCER (r 2 : 0. 67 - 0. 95). In order to improve odour and gas prediction models, animal activity and dirtiness of pens should be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the concentration level of ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) in two different fattening pig houses operated with slatted floor and straw flow system. The field study was performed for three day. One large-scale pig house with capacity of 230 pigs operate with deep litter manure system under the <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> and one small-scale pig feeding operation with capacity of 200 pigs operated by scraper and straw flow system, located at the Iksan city, South Korea, were investigated in this study. Average emissions of gases on the slatted floor pig house measured were 59. 8 - 70. 5 ppm NH 3, 0. 048 - 0. 78 ppm H 2 S, 453. 1 - 650. 8 ppm CO 2 and 0. 21 - 0. 68 ppm N 2 O while the concentrations of these gases at straw flow pig house were determined as 28. 17 - 42. 53 ppm NH 3, 0. 11 - 0. 43 ppm N 2 O, 0. 018 - 0. 043 ppm H 2 S, 400. 2 - 498. 3 ppm CO 2.

40|$|Gaseous {{emissions}} from agriculture {{contribute to a}} number of environmental effects. Carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) are greenhouse gases taking part to the global problem of climate change. Ammonia (NH 3) emissions are responsible of soil acidification and eutrophication and contribute also to indirect emissions of N 2 O. This work evaluated the influence of the type of floor on the emissions of these gases in the raising of weaned pigs. Two trials were carried out. In the first trial, the animals were kept either on <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> or on straw-based deep litter and, in the second one, either on <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> or on sawdust-based deep litter. For each trial and on each type of floor, 2 successive batches of weaned pigs were raised without changing the litter or emptying the slurry pit between the 2 batches. The rooms were automatically ventilated to maintain a constant ambient temperature. The performance of the animals was not significantly different according to the floor type. In trial 1, the nitrogen contents of the straw deep litter (including the substrate) and slurry were respectively 276 and 389 g pig- 1. In trial 2, the sawdust deep litter and slurry nitrogen contents were respectively 122 and 318 g pig- 1. Raising pigs on straw deep litter produced proportionately around 100 % more NH 3 than raising pigs on slatted floor (0. 61 vs. 0. 31 g NH 3 -N d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 05). Differences in CO 2, H 2 O and CH 4 emissions were not significant between systems. Raising pigs on sawdust deep litter produced also proportionately more NH 3 (+ 52 %; 0. 55 vs. 0. 36 g NH 3 -N d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 01) but also more CO 2 (+ 25 %; 427 vs. 341 g d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 001) and H 2 O (+ 65 %; 981 vs. 593 g d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 001) and less CH 4 (- 40 %; 0. 52 vs. 0. 86 g d- 1 per pig; P< 0. 001) than raising pigs on slatted floor. Practically no N 2 O emission was observed from rooms with slatted floor while the N 2 O emissions were 0. 03 and 0. 32 g N 2 O-N d- 1 per pig for the straw and sawdust deep litter respectively. The warming potential of the greenhouse gases (N 2 O + CH 4), were about 22, 34 and 168 g CO 2 equivalents per day and per pig on <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floor,</b> straw or sawdust deep litter respectively.

40|$|Former {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} social experience during nursing in either a group housing system with straw or a very spacious farrowing/nursing pen with straw, increases social skills of growing pigs considerably. Based on experiences in Taiwan, it was postulated that such skills could also be acquired in the period between being taken from flatdecks at 10 weeks of age {{and the age of}} 5 months. In an ‘arena’, copied from the one used for introducing new pigs (gilts) in a group housing system, agonistic behaviour and number and severity of lesions of the integument of 384 experimental GY x DUROC hybrid gilts were studied and compared with data of an equal number of control gilts in three different treatments (repeated once). The experimental animals were born in individual farrowing crates with <b>slatted</b> <b>floors.</b> They were weaned at 30 days and kept in flatdeck cages with two other litters, until 10 weeks. At that time they were kept in groups of eight on <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> and treated with regrouping and repenning several times until the final testing at an age of 5 months. In sequential experiments, this treatment was given twice, three times or four times and effects on social (agonistic) behaviour were studied. The control animals were born in a group farrowing house with straw, where they stayed 30 days (some days after weaning). As for the experimental pigs, two litters were grouped in flatdeck cages. At 10 weeks of age they were moved to pens with <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> where they remained in groups of eight undisturbed until final testing at 5 months. At an age of five months, eight unfamiliar experimental animals were grouped in a so-called arena for 24 h. So were 8 control pigs in the same week. Time-lapse video observations during these 24 h (2 frames/s) revealed that the pigs were fighting for social dominance during this period. Experimental pigs that had been regrouped four times only showed 57 % of bilateral agonistic actions and 82 % of total fighting time, in comparison with control pigs. Three times regrouping still showed a statistically significant lower amount of fighting, but twice regrouping did not. After 24 h in the arena, the number of lesions of the integument was significantly smaller in groups that had experienced regrouping 3 or 4 times. These results proved that social experience by regrouping and repenning prepared gilts for agonistic encounters, by improving their social skills...|$|R
40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study of 93 farms in England {{was carried out}} to estimate the prevalence and associated risk factors for bursitis. A total of 6250 pigs aged 6 - 22 weeks were examined for presence and severity of bursitis. Details of pen construction, pen quality and farm management were recorded including floor type, presence of bedding, condition of the floor and floor materials. The prevalence of bursitis was 41. 2 % and increased with each week of age (OR 1. 1). Two-level logistic regression models were developed with the outcome as the proportion of pigs affected with bursitis in a pen. Pigs kept on soil floors with straw bedding were used as the reference level. In comparison with these soil floors, bursitis increased on concrete floors where the bedding was deep throughout (OR 4. 6), deep in part (OR 3. 7), and sparse throughout (OR 9. 0), part <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> (OR 8. 0), and <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> (OR 18. 8). Slip or skid marks in the dunging area (OR 1. 5), pigs observed slipping during {{the examination of the}} pen (OR 1. 3) and wet floors (OR 3. 6) were also associated with an increased risk of bursitis.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of capped hock in 5601 post weaning pigs from 93 representative pig farms in England was 17. 2 %. The prevalence increased with age. Once adjusted for age, the lowest {{prevalence of}} capped hock {{was observed in}} pigs kept on soil floors (usually covered with deep straw bedding). There was no {{significant increase in the}} risk of capped hock in pigs kept on solid concrete floors with deep straw bedding. However, pigs kept on solid concrete with some, or the entire pen, sparsely bedded and pigs kept on partially or <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> had an approximately three fold increased risk of capped hock. This did not vary significantly between these four floor types. This was in contrast to the associated risks for bursitis in the same pigs, where as the floor went from highly resilient (straw and solid floors) to hard and perforated (<b>fully</b> <b>slatted)</b> the risk of bursitis increased similar to a dose response. No other variables that were measured were associated with a change in risk for capped hock, while observation of pigs slipping or slip marks and wet, dirty and worn pens were also associated risks for bursitis. These results indicate that capped hock and bursitis are both affected by exposure to floors, but in different ways. The prevalence of capped hock was associated only with floor hardness, with deep straw protecting the pigs, while bursitis was associated with both changes in bedding depth (hardness), floor material (soil versus concrete) and floor construction (solid versus slatterd floors) and in factors associated with locomotion (slipping and slip marks). These results indicate that the aetiology of capped hock and bursitis might differ...|$|R

Within each batch, about half of the pigs were allocated either to <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> or to straw deep litter pens. Within each housing system, batches were alternatively fed with a dry or a liquid feed, distributed semi ad libitum. The pigs were slaughtered at around 116 kg live weight and 160 days of age which is about 20 days earlier than in commercial French piggeries. At slaughter, a backfat sample was collected for androstenone and skatole measurement by HPLC. Neither compound was influenced by live weight (P > 0. 1) but decreased with age (P < 0. 02) probably in relation to a slower growth rate. Skatole was slightly lower on deep litter (P < 0. 08) and androstenone under liquid feeding (P < 0. 1). Overall, the percentage of tainted carcasses was 14 or 26 % according to the method used to classify the carcasses.

40|$|Abstract Background Lesions on sows' {{limbs and}} bodies are an {{abnormality}} that might {{impact on their}} welfare. The prevalence of and risks for limb and body lesions on lactating sows on commercial English pig farms were investigated using direct observation of the sows and their housing. Results The prevalence of lesions on the limbs and body were 93 % (260 / 279) and 20 % (57 / 288) respectively. The prevalence of limb and body lesions was significantly lower in outdoor-housed sows compared with indoor-housed sows. Indoor-housed sows had {{an increased risk of}} wounds (OR 6. 8), calluses (OR 8. 8) and capped hock (OR 3. 8) on their limbs when housed on <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> compared with solid concrete floors. In addition, there was an increased risk of bursitis (OR 2. 7), capped hock (OR 2. 3) and shoulder lesions (OR 4. 8) in sows that were unwilling to rise to their feet. There was a decreased risk of shoulder lesions (OR 0. 3) and lesions elsewhere on the body (OR 0. 2) in sows with more than 20 cm between their tail and the back of the crate compared with sows with less than 10 cm. Conclusion The sample of outdoor housed sows in this study had the lowest prevalence of limb and body lesions. In lactating sows housed indoors there was a general trend for an increased risk of limb and body lesions in sows housed on <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> compared with those housed on solid concrete floors with bedding.

The overall prevalence of foot lesions was 39. 6 % in 2283 pigs from 90 representative pig farms in England. The most prevalent lesions were heel/sole bruising (7. 1 %), heel/sole erosion (10. 8 %), heel flaps (8. 4 %) and toe erosion (11. 6 %). Pigs were kept on either solid (41 %), partly slatted (28 %) or <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> (31 %) <b>floors.</b> Of the 104 pens with a solid floor, 26 % of pens were outside with straw bedding on a soil base, 33 % were indoors with deep bedding on solid concrete, 25 % were partly deeply bedded on solid concrete and 16 % were sparsely bedded on solid concrete. Only six of the pens with partly <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> were bedded. Multilevel logistic-regression models were built using data from 100 farms to examine the risks for individual foot lesions with prevalences > 5 %. The prevalence of toe erosions was positively associated with deep bedding, whereas deep bedding and soil floors were negatively associated with the prevalence of heel/sole erosions. Heel flaps and heel/sole bruising were both associated with <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> possibly indicating a common aetiology. The greatest reduction in prevalence of all these lesions, from AFp calculations, would be achieved by moving pigs from <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> onto solid floors...|$|R
40|$|Tail biting is an {{abnormal}} behaviour of pigs that {{is thought to}} have a multi-factorial origin. It is considered an unpredictable event on farms and is hard to reproduce experimentally. Therefore, a novel approach involving a case control study was used to investigate risk factors for tail biting on commercial units in England. Ninety-two pig farms across England were visited over a period of 11 months. At each visit, the owner or the manager of the unit was interviewed and the unit inspected. Data were recorded on standard forms. Farms were categorised into those that had tail biting in at least one pig in the past 6 months and those that had not. Univariate and logistic regression analyses yielded the following main results. Adding straw in the creep area once or more per day decreased the risk of tail biting 10 -fold. Keeping grower pigs on partially or <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> versus solid floor increased risks of tail biting (odds ratio (OR) = 3. 2). Using a feeding system with five or more grower pigs per feed space increased risks of tail biting (OR = 2. 7). A stocking density during the growing phase of 110 kg/m(2) or greater increased risks of tail biting (OR = 2. 7). Farms that belonged to a holding of five or more pig units had an increased risk of tail biting (OR = 3. 5). As the number of pens per stockman increased by one, the risk of tail biting increased 1. 06 -fold. Tail biting was also associated with the following disease and production information: as the P 2 back-fat value increased by I turn, the risk of tail biting decreased by 1. 5 -fold; post-weaning mortality above 2. 5 % was associated with a 3. 9 -fold increase in the risk of tail biting; presence of respiratory diseases was associated with a 1. 6 -fold increase in the risk of tail biting.

40|$|According to the literature, {{the diet}} {{composition}} of livestock can influence polluting gas emissions from agriculture. The {{aim of this}} preliminary study was to measure gaseous emissions from fattening pigs offered an ad libitum high-fibre diet (HFD) and kept on <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floor.</b> A batch of 24 fattening pigs was divided into two homogeneous groups randomly allocated to a treatment: conventional cereals-based diet or sugar beet pulpbased diet (HFD). With HFD, a significant decrease of animal performance was observed (837 vs. 962 g for the average daily gain). With pigs offered HFD, gaseous emissions per pig were significantly lower for NH 3 (- 30 %, 6. 64 vs. 9. 47 g/d; P< 0. 05) and significantly greater for CH 4 (+ 40 %, 6. 46 vs. 4. 60 g/d; P< 0. 05). The emissions of N 2 O (0. 34 g/d), CO 2 equivalent (0. 27 kg/d), CO 2 (1. 68 kg/d) were not significantly influenced by the diet. Due to a more important microbial activity with HFD, the lower NH 3 -emissions {{could be attributed to}} the shift of a part of excreted nitrogen from urine (as urea) to faeces (as protein form), and to a lower slurry pH explained by the increase of volatile fatty acid content. The higher CH 4 -emissions could be explained by a greater production in the digestive tract and in the slurry due to fibre fermentations. In conclusion, HFD allowed decreasing NH 3 - and increasing CH 4 -emissions. However, in terms of climate change, this increase was offset by the decrease of indirect N 2 O-emissions due to NH 3 -emission decrease, as indicated by the similar CO 2 equivalent-emissions in the two groups...|$|E
40|$|Growth performance, behaviour, cleanliness, carcass {{traits and}} meat quality of 48 Simmental young bulls housed on slatted floor or on straw bedding {{with the same}} space {{allowance}} were compared in the study, which lasted 250 days. The animals (initial body weight = 321. 2 ± 34. 1 kg) were assigned to 8 balanced groups, according to their initial body weight. All the groups were reared in separate pens with a space allowance of 3 m 2 /head. Four pens had a concrete floor covered with a straw bedding while the other pens had a <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> made of concrete slats. All the animals received the same diet provided ad libitum. Type of floor {{did not affect the}} bulls’ daily gain, feed intake and feed efficiency. Health status of the animals was satisfactory throughout the trial and several blood indicators of chronic stress were not modified by the treatment. Behavioural observations carried out at d 10, 80, 180 and 240 showed differences only on some behaviours due to the type of floor. In particular, the straw bedding increased eating behaviour and it encouraged the simultaneous presence of more bulls at the manger. Regardless of the type of floor, the progress of the trial showed a linear increase of animals’ inactivity (P results can be referred to the growth of the animal body frame, which made the space allowance progressively limiting. In the straw bedded pens, clean straw was added weekly and fully renewed every 3 weeks, but this bedding management did not allow a satisfactory cleanliness of the animals in comparison with the slatted floor. However, the worse cleanliness of the bulls on the straw did not promote their grooming activity. Young bulls were slaughtered at a final weight of 614. 6 ± 14. 7 kg and their carcass traits and meat quality were not affected by the treatment. The straw bedded system cannot always be considered the cleanest solution for the housing of beef cattle and its frequent renewal must be carried out, particularly when animals are kept with a minimum space allowance. The minimal differences observed for all the parameters measured in the study between the two types of floors must be related to the adoption of the same space allowance/animal and this factor has shown to be the most critical housing parameter affecting beef cattle welfare during the fattening period...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decades, the {{increasing}} scale of intensive pig farms led farmers to use automatic tools {{to monitor the}} welfare and health of their animals. Visual observation and manual monitoring, usually practiced in small-scale farms, is unreliable in large-scale husbandry, and is expensive and time consuming. Environmental parameters are crucial information for the efficient management of piggery buildings, as they {{have a significant effect}} on production efficiency, health and welfare of confined animals. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between pig activity and environmental parameters in a pig building by means of image analysis. The barn for 350 fattening pigs was open-space, mechanically ventilated and subdivided into 16 pens with <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floor.</b> The room was equipped to monitor the ventilation rate, internal and external temperature and relative humidity every minute. For the experiments, two adjacent pens were selected, each 5. 9 by 2. 6 m, with ~ 16 pigs in each. Pigs were continuously monitored during 30 days using an infrared-sensitive CCD camera that was mounted 5 m above the floor. Recorded data were processed in real time by Eyenamic, an innovative software that continuously and automatically registers the behaviour of a group of animals, intended as the activity and occupation indices of the pigs. A preliminary virtual subdivision of the two pens in four zones (two zones for each pen) was performed to evaluate differences in activity/occupation indices in ‘front’ and ‘back’ zones of the pen. Recorded images were visually observed in the laboratory to estimate pig activity type in relation to the indices calculated by Eyenamic software. The occupation index showed higher values (up to 0. 75 units) in Zones 1 and 4 placed near the corridor. There was a significant relation between pig occupation index measured in the two pens and ventilation rate, temperature and humidity. The interaction between ventilation and humidity and temperature and humidity significantly affected pig movements during the day. Pigs tended to stay in the part of the pen far from the external wall, where air velocity was higher, probably because this is a ‘central zone’ in the barn, characterised by a reasonable air movement (~ 0. 30 m/s). On the contrary, the part of the pen nearest to the external wall, characterised by a humid floor surface and by a limited air speed, was occupied by animals at the trough mainly during feeding times and for defecation and urination. status: publishe...|$|E

Manure was stored as slurry below the slatted floor in the CON system and as litter for the inside area, or slurry and liquid, for the outside area, in the OUT system. The amount and composition of manure were determined {{at the end of}} each replicate. Ammonia emission from the rooms was measured continuously, Dust and odour concentrations were measured in replicates 1 and 2 and CH(4), N(2) O and CO(2) emissions were measured in replicate 3. Compared with the CON, the OUT pigs exhibited a faster growth rate (+ 8 %, P < 0. 001) due to their greater feed intake (+ 0. 21 kg/day, P < 0. 01), resulting in a heavier BW (+ 7. 3 kg, P < 0. 001) and a lower lean meat content (- 1. 6 % points, P < 0. 001) at slaughter The total amount of manure produced per pig was similar in both systems (380 kg/pig), but because of the contribution of sawdust, dry matter (DM) content was higher (P < 0. 001) and concentrations in N, P K, Cu and Zn in DM were lower (P < 0. 001) in manure from the OUT than from the CON system. In the OUT system, most of the manure DM (70 %) was collected indoor, corresponding mostly to the contribution of the sawdust, and most of the manure water (70 %) was collected outdoor Pigs excreted indoor about 60 % and 40 % of urine and faeces respectively.

40|$|Concrete {{slatted floor}} {{has been the}} most common housing system for {{intensive}} beef cattle production in Sweden. The slatted floor is self-cleaning and does not require any bedding. The labour input therefore is minimal. Concerns have however, been expressed about the negative influence of systems with fully slatted floors on animal health and welfare. Consequently the interest in deep litter systems has grown in the recent years. These systems are considered to create better animal environment and they also allow cattle to be housed in uninsulated buildings. The aim of this report is to discuss suitable housing systems for beef cattle in Sweden in the 21 :st century. Both the economic and animal welfare aspects are considered. A housing system must primarily be evaluated based on the physiological and ethological demands of the animals. If the system does not fulfil these demands it should not be considered at all. A recommended housing system must furthermore be economic, both in terms of investment and operation cost. Animal health, aerial environment and the ethological suitability, are important not only to the animal welfare but also have a significant influence on the economic result of the production. The deep litter system is the most common alternative to the slatted floor system in Sweden. The main disadvantages of the deep litter system are the large requirement of straw and the relatively high labour demand. The labour input depends very much on the straw handling system, both in the field and at the farmstead. The straw handling system is typically effective and well mechanised in the field, while transfer from the store and distribution in the bedded court too often is a cumbersome and heavy work. Inventive farmers have come up with their own technical solutions to solve these problems. An alternative to decrease the straw requirement is the sloped floor. The sloped floor is another very interesting housing system. Various types of sloped floor have been developed and used around Europe for several years and in recent years a few have been built in Sweden. The sloped floor system takes advantage of cattle preference for an elevated laying area. Animal movements transport the manure down the slop to a scraped passage and the higher parts of the bedded area remains relatively clean and dry. The building investment costs are much lower than that of a building with slatted floor and less straw is needed compared to a deep litter system. Labour input and costs directly connected to the housing system were compared in the <b>fully</b> <b>slatted</b> <b>floor,</b> deep straw bedding and sloped floor housing systems. The daily straw requirement was set to be 4 kg in the deep straw bedding system and 3 kg in the sloped floor system. The main difference between the systems was the time required for the straw and manure handling. Thus the labour input was shown to be lowest in the slatted floor system and highest in the deep straw bedding system. The system related costs, i. e. the building, the manure handling system, straw material, straw handling and labour, were considered in the economic comparison. Eventually differences in daily gain, feed vonversion and energy input were not considered. Two alternatives were looked at. In the first cattle were kept indoor year round and in the second they were allowed a grazing period of 120 days/year. The differences between the systems were small, though the sloped floor had the lowest costs, irrespective of grazing period (see table below). The slatted floor system is expensive to construct while operation costs are low. Hence, to be competitive the slatted floor system must be put to efficient use at all times to bring down the cost per animal. Big investment costs, such as systems with slatted floor pens, in combination with grazing, can be less profitable compared to straw bedded systems. The conclusion is that the same economic result can be achieved by raising beef cattle in considerably better animal welfare systems than slatted floor pens. Good alternatives are deep straw bedding or sloped floor in uninsulated buildings...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find whether {{laminitis}} like changes in beef cattle were affected by flooring systems and different breeds. Studied breeds were Bayerisch Fleckvieh and Holstein Frisian and the different <b>flooring</b> systems were <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> of iron, concrete and rubber.

Animals kept on rubber <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> showed a greater angle between distal phalanx and dorsal wall of the claw (P< 0, 01). This change is caused by a greater activity and due to a change of the position of the claw. No relationship was found for concavity and different <b>slatted</b> <b>floors.</b> However claws from bulls kept on concrete <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> showed a convex shape.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the emission, proper {{understanding}} of the transportation behaviour of gaseous ammonia inside the slurry pit is required. Numerical simulation by the aid of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique can be used for this purpose. However, direct modelling of <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> is complicated and may be replaced by the porous media model (PMM) as shown in earlier studies. The objective of our study is {{to improve the quality of}} simulation results by PMM, and to assess the effects of air velocity above the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> (as affected by wind), pit headspace height (as affected by amount of slurry in the pit) and sidewall height (as affected by the dairy house sidewall) on the airflow features inside the pit and ammonia emission from the pit. Three different CFD models of a <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> were developed to evaluate whether porous media is capable to represent a <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> for modelling the airflow inside and ammonia emission from the slurry pit, and to study the effect of turbulence treatment in the porous media on the modelling results: a <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> model (SFM) which models the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> as it is, a turbulent porous media model (PMM-T) and a laminar porous media model (PMM-L). Both PMM-T and PMM-L represent the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> by porous media, the PMM-T assumes turbulent airflow and the PMM-L assumes laminar airflow in the porous media. The SFM was verified for a dataset acquired from a 1 : 8 scale wind tunnel model of the slurry pit. Results showed that the PMM (PMM-T and PMM-L) were able to predict both the airflow features inside the slurry pit and the ammonia emission from the slurry pit if the resistance parameters and flow regime of the porous media were properly set. In comparison to the SFM, the PMM-T predicted the flow pattern better, but overestimated the turbulence intensity and the consequent emission rate. PMM-L performed better in predicting the ammonia emission rate because of the relatively accurate prediction of turbulence intensity. Simulation results also showed that the ammonia emission rate increased with a higher mean airflow velocity, a smaller headspace height and the presence of sidewalls. </p...|$|R
