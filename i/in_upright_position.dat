40|$|Measured by {{a variety}} of techniques, the overall ventilation-perfusion {{relationship}} of the normal human lung is different <b>in</b> supine and <b>upright</b> <b>positions,</b> and <b>in</b> the <b>upright</b> <b>position,</b> the upper regions of the lung are relatively poorly perfused (1 - 4). Similarly, pulmonary diffusing capacity (DL) is reduced when normal subjects change from supine to <b>upright</b> <b>positions</b> (5, 6); <b>in</b> the <b>upright</b> <b>position,</b> carbon monoxide absorption is greater in the lower portions of the lung than in the upper portions (7). These differences are probably related to a gravity dependent gradient of perfusion and capillary filling caused by the inability of the normally low pulmonary arterial pressure to provide uniformly adequate perfusion against the hydrostatic gradient that must be present in the pulmonary vascular bed of normal adult humans <b>in</b> an <b>upright</b> <b>position</b> (2, 8). The present investigation was undertaken to determine a) whether the normal postural changes in physiologic dead space and diffusing capacity are present in patients in whom the pulmonary vascular pressure should be great enough to insure perfusion of the entire lung <b>in</b> the <b>upright</b> <b>position</b> and b) whether an acute increase in pulmonary vascular pressures affects the arterialalveolar CO 2 gradient and alveolar dead space of normal men <b>in</b> an <b>upright</b> <b>position.</b> Methods Thirty-four adult patients having clinical cardiac catheterizations and 20 trained normal subj ects were * Submitted for publication July 8, 1963; accepted Septembe...|$|R

50|$|Guy derrick (also {{known as}} boom derrick) is a fixed guyed mast derrick {{that can be}} rotated and {{connected}} to a boom. The mast is <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position</b> with the base that can make the mast rotate, but not to be lean in any direction. The top of the mast is connected to many guy wires which are anchored to the ground to support the load. At the base, the mast is also connect to the bottom end of the boom. The boom extends outward and upward to the desired position. The top of the boom is a pulley system that {{is connected to the}} top of the mast to control how far the boom is to be from the mast. When the mast is rotated, the connected boom is swung from to the side. The control of the lifting location is done by the manipulation of the top pulley system and the rotation of the mast at the base. The load is lifted by another pulley system connected {{to the top of the}} boom. In a medium load lifting, another construction method can be used. In this case, the mast is fixed without being rotated, but the boom can be swung around the mast. This can be done by connecting the bottom of the boom with two boards on the opposite sides around the surface of the boom to form a fork. The fork and the bottom part of the boom is lashed to secure them together. Another lashing is between the fork area and the mast at a higher position to support the weight of the boom. The fork is put around the mast such that the bottom of the boom is rested on the mast without permanently fixed to it. The fork prevent the boom to come off the mast while swinging up to 180 degrees.|$|E

5000|$|The year 2010 {{marked the}} next {{milestone}} in rolling out the M5000 turbine with the Tripod foundation. The two projects Borkum West II and Global Tech I decided to erect their farms using this technology platform. 40 Tripods were ordered by each project in first instance nearly {{at the same}} time. Anticipating this demand WeserWind has developed a serial production approach for Tripods in the years before, together with Dr. Möller GmbH / IMS Nord, Bremerhaven. The key parameters of this approach are the upright assembly concept, the setup of an assembly line with up to nine work stations, the transportation of the growing structures on behalf of heavy load rail carriers along the assembly line and the integrated load out operation to a tailor made pontoon. Based on this concept Georgsmarienhütte released the investment program building this assembly shop with two parallel lines at Lunedeich, Bremerhaven. The building was operational {{in the beginning of}} 2011 and in June the first Borkum-West II-Tripod was completed. In December 2011 the pontoon was baptised and the offshore terminal ABC-Peninsula was commissioned by BLG Logistics Solutions GmbH & Co. KG after essential upgrading. Finally 100 Tripods have been built at this site in the years from 2011 to 2013. The cycle time for the whole plant was reached with down to five calendar days per structure. The load out cycle was achieved to four hours. Also SIAG Emden and the consortium Iemants N.V. with Eiffage Construction Métallique S.A.S. in Vlissingen produced in total 20 Tripods in that time <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position.</b> The offshore transportation technology has been developed significantly since Alpha Ventus. The Offshore Construction Jack Up “Innovation” by HGO InfraSea Solutions GmbH & Co. KG was commissioned in 2012 and did her first job for Global Tech 1 carrying three Tripods and pile sets per sail. The crane ships “Stanislaw Yudin” and “Oleg Strassnow” by SHL Seaway Heavy Lifting were in operation for Borkum West II.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} made on axial {{reflexion}} of the kidneys and kinking of the ureter, {{to be caused by}} a change in posture, by taking pyelography of 105 individuals. The following observations were made: 1. It was shown that downward displacement of the kidneys, if it was within 5 cm., was normal in both men and women. There was a greater downward displacement in men than in women, and in the left kidneys than in the right one. 2. The normal position occupied by the lower pole of a kidney in terms of spinal vertebral height corresponded to lumbar III-IV in supine position and lumbar IV <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position.</b> In both upright and supine positions, the positions occupied by the kidneys were higher than that occupied by the right one. 3. Many individuals had a smaller pelvic-spinal angle <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position</b> than in supine position. Some, however, showed abnormal angles. 4. The pelvic long axis showed a markedly smaller value <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position</b> than in supine position; in some, the value of pelvic long axis <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position</b> was less than two-thirds as much as the value of pelvic long axis in supine position. 5. Downward displacement of the kidneys caused a deformity of the ureter to occur. Generally speaking, the deformity was seen in upper one-third of the ureter in many instances...|$|E

40|$|Background Low {{level of}} {{physical}} activity is common among hospitalized older adults and is associated with worse prognosis. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe the pattern and level {{of physical activity}} in a group of hospitalized older adults and to identify factors associated with physical activity. Methods We measured physical activity on day three after admission using accelerometer based activity monitors and time <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position</b> as outcome measure. We collected data of physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB. 0 – 12), cognitive function (Mini Mental Status Examination, MMSE, 0 – 30 and diagnosis of cognitive impairment at discharge, yes/no), personal Activities of Daily Living (p-ADL, Barthel Index, BI, 0 – 20) and burden of disease (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, CIRS, 0 – 56). We analyzed data using univariable and multivariable linear regression models, with time <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position</b> as dependent variable. Results We recorded physical activity in a consecutive sample of thirty-eight geriatric patients. Their (mean age 82. 9 years, SD 6. 3) mean time <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position</b> one day early after admission was 117. 1 min (SD 90. 1, n = 38). Mean SPPB score was 4. 3 (SD 3. 3, n = 34). Mean MMSE score was 19. 3 (SD 5. 3, n = 30), 73 % had a diagnosis of cognitive impairment (n = 38). Mean BI score was 16. 4 (SD 4. 4, n = 36). Mean CIRS score was 17. 0 (SD 4. 2, n = 38). There was a significant association between SPPB score and time <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position</b> (p = 0. 048) : For each one unit increase in SPPB, the expected increase in upright time was 11. 7 min. There was no significant association between age (p = 0. 608), diagnosis of cognitive impairment (p = 0. 794), p-ADL status (p = 0. 127), CIRS score (p = 0. 218) and time <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position.</b> The overall model fit was R 2 0. 431. Conclusion Participants’ mean time <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position</b> one day early after admission was almost two hours, indicating a high level of physical activity compared to results from similar studies. Physical function was the only variable significantly associated with physical activity indicating that SPPB could be a useful screening tool and that mobilization regimes should be delivered routinely for patients with reduced physical function...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the accuracy of dynamic lumbosacral-MRI compared to upright myelography to detect segmental dural compression. Methods and Materials: 95 patients were screened for the study. Seventeen patients complaining of low back pain and clinically suspected dural compression qualified for the study. These patients underwent myelography and dynamic lumbosacral-MRI with an open-configuration 0. 25 T tilting system. Images were obtained in supine and upright position for both modalities. Two independent readers evaluated the myelography images and the lumbosacral- MRI on a persegment basis with regard to segmental dural compression. Reference standard was a consensus reading of myelography <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position.</b> Reader agreement was assessed by correlation statistics (Cohen's kappa) and diagnostic accuracy was calculated on a persegment basis. Results: Myelography <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position</b> showed 35 segmental dural compressions. Lumbosacral-MRI showed 30 segmental dural compressions in supine and 33 <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position.</b> The agreement between the readers for Myelography in supine and upright position was 0. 881 and 0. 808 respectively. The inter-rater agreement for MRI in supine and upright position was 0. 895 and 0. 747. MRI sensitivity/specificity <b>in</b> <b>upright</b> <b>position</b> were 80 %/ 92 % for reader 1 and 74. 3 %/ 96 % for reader 2; in supine position 77. 1 %/ 96 % for reader 1 and 74. 1 %/ 98 % for reader 2. Conclusion: Dynamic MRI with an open-configuration, low-field tilting MRI system is a feasible and promising tool to study lumbosacral dural compression. We demonstrated that this MR technology performed highly specific compared to upright myelography, but had some limitations regarding sensitivity. Interobserver agreement was comparable to myelography...|$|E
