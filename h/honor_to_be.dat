5|$|There {{are three}} {{versions}} of the Medal of Honor, {{one for each of}} the military departments of the Department of Defense: Army, Navy, and Air Force. Members of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard are eligible to receive the Navy version. Each is constructed differently and the components are made from gilding metals and red brass alloys with some gold plating, enamel, and bronze pieces. The United States Congress considered a bill in 2004 which would require the Medal of <b>Honor</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made with 90% gold, the same composition as the lesser-known Congressional Gold Medal, but the measure was dropped.|$|E

He was the first Eagles player to be inducted. Clarke Hinkle presented him with the honor at the induction ceremony. Van Buren's acceptance speech consisted of four sentences:Thank you Clarke Hinkle, I'm certainly glad to have broken your record. Since you people can't hear too good and I'm not too good a speaker I won't say much, but it's a great <b>honor</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> here. The two days I've spent in Canton will certainly bring me back every year from now on. Thank you very much.|$|E
5|$|Mt. St. Peter Parish has {{a branch}} of the Saint Vincent De Paul Society. The goal of this branch of the society, like all other branches, is to help the poor, the sick, and the suffering. Members of this group work to help people locally by {{collecting}} food and delivering it to food banks in and around New Kensington. Within the church, it is seen as a great <b>honor</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of this society and the members believe that the best help lies in the people they are more than in the caring acts they perform. They all work together to help others and they continually strive to become better Catholics.|$|E

5|$|Sam Jones III was {{the last}} of the season one series regulars to be cast–being hired just four days before filming for the pilot episode began. Jones, who is African American, was also cast against the Superman mythology where Pete Ross is Caucasian. Jones has stated that he would have {{understood}} if the producers had simply created a black character for him to portray, but the fact that they chose to go with him, even though the character has always been white, gave him more <b>honor</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of the show. During the first season, Jones felt like he should have more screen time, but later conceded that the show was about Clark's journey and that the other characters are there to help his story move along.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five African Americans {{earned the}} Medal of Honor during the American Civil War, {{including}} seven sailors of the Union Navy, fifteen {{soldiers of the}} United States Colored Troops, and three soldiers of other Army units. Fourteen African American men earned the Medal for actions in the Battle of Chaffin's Farm, where a division of U.S. Colored Troops saw heavy action. Another four men, all sailors, earned their Medals at the Battle of Mobile Bay. William Harvey Carney was the first African American to perform an action for which a Medal of Honor was awarded, but Robert Blake {{was the first to}} actually receive the Medal (Blake's was issued in 1864, Carney did not receive his until 1900). It was common for Civil War Medals of <b>Honor</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> awarded decades after the conflict ended; in one case, Andrew Jackson Smith's Medal was not awarded until 2001, 137 years after the action in which he earned it. Smith's wait, caused by a missing battle report, is the longest delay of the award for any recipient, African American or otherwise.|$|E

25|$|It is {{considered}} a great <b>honor</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> invited to live on The Lawn, and 54 fourth-year undergraduates do so each year, joining ten members of the faculty who permanently live and teach in the Pavilions there. Similarly, graduate students may live on The Range. Edgar Allan Poe formerly lived in 13 West Range, and since 1904 the Raven Society has retrofitted and preserved his room much as it may have existed in the 1820s.|$|E
25|$|The Zichen Hall, {{located in}} the inner court, is {{approximately}} 95 meters north of the Xuanzheng Hall. It housed the central government offices. For officials, it was considered a great <b>honor</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> summoned to the Zichen Hall. The Taiye Pool, {{also known as the}} Penglai Pool, is north of the Zichen Hall. It expanded over 240 mu (40 acres or 0.16km²) and an island representing the mythical land of Penglai was built within it. The former gardens that surround the pond and island have been recreated, based on the historical record, with peony, chrysanthemum, plum, rose, bamboo, almond, peach, and persimmon gardens.|$|E

25|$|There is a male {{bias and}} a male {{priority}} generally present {{in both the}} private life and public life of women. However, it never becomes absolute. In the Decalogue (Ten Commandments) of , aspects of both male priority and gender balance can be seen. In the tenth commandment, a wife is depicted in the examples not to be coveted: house, wife, male or female slave, ox or donkey, or 'anything that belongs to your neighbour.' (NIV) On the other hand, the fifth commandment does not make any distinction between <b>honor</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shown to parents. This {{is consistent with the}} mutual respect shown for both parents throughout the Old Testament.|$|E
25|$|The Olympic Torch Relay ends {{on the day}} of {{the opening}} {{ceremony}} in the central stadium of the Games. The final carrier is often kept unannounced until the last moment, and is usually a sports celebrity of the host country. The final bearer of the torch runs towards the cauldron, often placed at the top of a grand staircase, and then uses the torch to start the flame in the arena. It is considered to be a great <b>honor</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> asked to light the Olympic flame. After being lit, the flame continues to burn throughout the Games, until the day of the closing ceremony and celebration, when it is finally put out, symbolizing the official end of the Games.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to The Original Series, Klingon culture is thoroughly examined in later series' episodes, {{part of a}} larger movement by Star Trek writers to deepen viewer understanding of the alien races of the franchise. The Klingons adhere to a strict code of honor, similar to feudal Mongolian or Japanese customs, although some, such as Gowron, appear to struggle to live up to their ideals. Their society is based on war and combat; ritual suicide is often preferred over living life as a crippled warrior, and may allow a warrior to die with <b>honor.</b> <b>To</b> <b>be</b> captured rather than killed in battle brings dishonor to not only the captive but his descendants. Death is depicted as a time for celebration, not grief.|$|E

500|$|... "The Ring" [...] portrays Disney as a {{corporation}} using the ruse of family-friendly morals to disguise their primary motive of profit, particularly through {{the portrayal of}} Mickey Mouse as a foul-mouthed, greedy, and physically violent company president.
