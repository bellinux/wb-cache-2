5|$|The Swiss {{historian}} Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897) in his The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (1860), by contrast, {{defined the}} Renaissance as {{the period between}} Giotto and Michelangelo in Italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries. He saw in the Renaissance {{the emergence of the}} modern spirit of individuality, which the Middle Ages had stifled. His book was widely read and became influential {{in the development of the}} modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance. However, Buckhardt has been accused of setting forth a linear Whiggish view of history <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> Renaissance as the origin of the modern world.|$|E

25|$|In {{explaining}} why neutral Britain {{went to war}} with Germany, Kennedy (1980) recognised it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a profound moral crime. The German invasion of neutral Belgium was not important because the British decision had already been made and the British were {{more concerned with the}} fate of France (pp.457–62). Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870, when Prussia and the German states smashed France, would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy-makers insisted that that would be a catastrophe for British security.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a longstanding}} {{tradition}} {{of reading the}} oracle in chapter 9 as a messianic prophecy–and those who read the prophecy this way seldom follow historical-critical scholars <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> Book of Daniel as a combination of legendary folktales and other visionary episodes that belong to the literary genre of Jewish pseudepigrapha, but {{as a series of}} historical events that actually took place in the sixth century BCE and are faithfully recorded as such in the biblical text. On this understanding, the prophecy has more in common with the genre of Old Testament prophecy in developing the ancient Jewish/Christian eschatological hope of a future messianic age in which the promised Davidic king will preside over an era of worldwide peace, prosperity, and enduring righteousness. This way of reading the prophecy has given rise to a rich tradition of Christian theological speculation beginning with the early church fathers in which the prophecy is understood to be a prediction involving the coming of Christ in Jesus of Nazareth.|$|E
25|$|Austen {{began writing}} the novel after staying at Goodnestone Park in Kent {{with her brother}} Edward and his wife in 1796. It was {{originally}} titled First Impressions, and was written between October 1796 and August 1797. On 1 November 1797 Austen's father {{sent a letter to}} London bookseller Thomas Cadell to ask if he had any interest <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> manuscript, but the offer was declined by return post. The militia were mobilised after the French declaration of war on Britain in February 1793, and there was initially a lack of barracks for all the militia regiments, requiring the militia to set up huge camps in the countryside, which the novel refers to several times. The Brighton camp for which the militia regiment leaves for in May after spending the winter in Meryton was opened in August 1793, and the barracks for all the regiments of the militia were completed by 1796, placing the events of the novel between 1793 and 1795.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was the native {{land of the}} “growthmen.” Its leading light, Paul Samuelson, had {{published}} a pathbreaking undergraduate textbook, Economics: An Introductory Analysis. In the sixth edition of Economics, Samuelson (1964) added a “new chapter on the theory of growth.” Samuelson drew on the work on growth theory of his younger colleague Robert Solow (1956)—an indication that growthmanship was taking an analytical turn. The MIT economists were thus growthmen in two senses: in seeing growth as an absolutely central policy imperative and <b>in</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>the</b> theory of growth as a focus for economic research. What the MIT growthmen added was a distinctive style of analysis that {{made it easier to}} address the dominant policy concerns in tractable formal models. Solow’s (1956) model was the perfect exemplar of the MIT style. It provided the central framework for the subsequent developments in growth theory and secured MIT as {{the center of the universe}} in the golden age of growth theory in the 1960s (Boianovsky and Hoover 199–200).|$|E
