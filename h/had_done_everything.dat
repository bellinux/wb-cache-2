5|$|In Reformed theology, baptism is {{a sacrament}} {{signifying}} the baptized person's union with Christ, or {{becoming part of}} Christ and being treated as if they <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> Christ had. Sacraments, along with preaching of God's word, are means of grace through which God offers Christ to people. Sacraments {{are believed to have}} their effect through the Holy Spirit, but these effects are only believed to be beneficial to those who have faith in Christ.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, the {{intersection}} was handling 30,000 drivers a day, from increasingly developed Cornwall, Newburgh and New Windsor. NYSDOT expanded {{the intersection}} with middle-turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches. Many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars' stopping to enter and exit nearby businesses. In 2001 state officials said they <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> possible to improve traffic flows through the Five Corners. Continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning.|$|E

Many in the press stated that Byers had {{defeated}} her {{and the image of}} Burke’s championship was tarnishing.

25|$|Gay {{people could}} seldom be {{convinced}} that heterosexual sex would {{provide them with the}} same pleasure they derived from homosexual sex. Patients often wanted to become heterosexual for reasons Freud considered superficial, including fear of social disapproval, an insufficient motive for change. Some might have no real desire to become heterosexual, seeking treatment only to convince themselves that they <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> possible to change, leaving them free to return to homosexuality after the failure they expected.|$|E
25|$|On 19July 1903, Younghusband {{arrived at}} Gangtok, {{the capital city}} of the Indian state of Sikkim, where John Claude White was Political Officer, to prepare for his mission. White was unhappy with his {{secondment}} to the expeditionary force and, to Younghusband's displeasure, <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> in his power to have the appointment cancelled. He failed and Younghusband had his revenge for White's insubordination when he later left him in the leech-infested jungles of Sikkim to arrange mule and coolie transport to Tibet.|$|E
25|$|By {{his second}} year in office, Bush was told by his {{economic}} advisors to stop dealing with the economy, as they believed that he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> necessary to ensure his reelection. By 1992, interest and inflation rates were the lowest in years, but by midyear the unemployment rate reached 7.8%, the highest since 1984. In September 1992, the Census Bureau reported that 14.2% of all Americans lived in poverty. Bush lost reelection in 1992 {{in large part because}} the American people, concerned about the economy, voted for change.|$|E

25|$|In April, the club's talented Nigerian midfielder John Obi Mikel {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Manchester United, and according to a statement by Lyn's managing director Morgan Andersen, it was the most expensive transfer in Norwegian football to date. The transfer has since been the source of a heated dispute, and Mikel instead joined Chelsea after a long period of time. FIFA released an announcement stating that Lyn <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> correct in the process. The transfer is said to have cost Chelsea £16 million. £12 million of this to Manchester United and £4 million to Lyn.|$|E
25|$|Once the Franks family {{received}} the ransom note the following morning, Leopold called {{a second time}} and dictated {{the first set of}} ransom payment instructions. The intricate plan stalled almost immediately when a nervous family member forgot the address of the store where he was supposed to receive the next set of directions; and it was abandoned entirely when word came that a man named Tony Minke had found the boy's body. Their kidnapping ruse exposed, Leopold and Loeb destroyed the stolen typewriter and burned a robe used to move the body. Convinced that they <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> they could to hide their tracks, they went about their lives as usual.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} that {{for each of the}} months from August to November, an increase of the average number of passengers carried per day was recorded, from 38 in August to 159 in November. In March, the South Eastern Railway Bill had its second reading in Parliament. Sir Charles Russell, MP stated that the South Eastern Railway (SER) <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> in its power to obstruct the English Channel Steamship Company. Lord Elcho stated that if the railway was sincere in its desire to improve communication with the continent (the stated aim of the bill), then it would run its trains to suit Castalia, rather than expecting the ship to run to suit its trains. After some discussion, the bill passed its second reading. Sir Edward Watkin was asked about this state of affairs at a shareholders meeting of the SER on 3 August. He replied that the railway could not run a special and regular service of trains to meet an irregular sailing schedule such as that operated by Castalia, which did not run in the winter. The boats that connected with the SERs trains operated a regular, year-round service.|$|E

500|$|According to Monsieur M'Barek's {{account of}} events, {{he had been}} {{drinking}} heavily and smoking cannabis when he was confronted with the [...] "excited and aggressive" [...] 10th Earl of Shaftesbury. A fight then broke out during which he [...] "accidentally" [...] strangled his brother-in-law while attempting to restrain him. Although M'Barek was rather hazy on the details, he testified, [...] "I don't know how it happened. It happened in a minute". He further stated that he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> he could to save the Earl, including mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and heart massage, but it [...] "was too late. He had left us".|$|E
500|$|The group held a final {{farewell}} tour of Australia in 1994, {{which was}} recorded and released on CD by ABC Records as DAAS: The Last Concert. The break-up sparked rumours of a falling {{out among the}} trio, although all three denied this, stating that it was simply time to move on. [...] Richard Fidler {{described it as a}} matter of practicality: Ferguson wanted to return to Australia to be closer to his young family, while McDermott and Fidler wished to continue working in Britain as they felt they <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> they had wanted to do in Australia.|$|E

500|$|Minogue {{has been}} {{inspired}} by and compared to Madonna throughout her career. Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue {{during the early years}} of her success with the observation: [...] "She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or Madonna... What I found amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her." [...] Minogue received negative comments that her Rhythm of Love tour in 1991 was too similar visually to Madonna's Blond Ambition World Tour, for which critics labelled her a Madonna wannabe. Kathy McCabe for The Telegraph noted that Minogue and Madonna follow similar styles in music and fashion, but concluded, [...] "Where they truly diverge on the pop-culture scale is in shock value. Minogue's clips might draw a gasp from some but Madonna's ignite religious and political debate unlike any other artist on the planet... Simply, Madonna is the dark force; Kylie is the light force." [...] Rolling Stone commented that, with the exception of the US, Minogue is regarded throughout the world as [...] "an icon to rival Madonna", saying, [...] "Like Madonna, Minogue was not a virtuosic singer but a canny trend spotter." [...] Minogue has said of Madonna, [...] "Her huge influence on the world, in pop and fashion, meant that I wasn't immune to the trends she created. I admire Madonna greatly but in the beginning she made it difficult for artists like me, she <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> there was to be done", and [...] "Madonna's the Queen of Pop, I'm the princess. I'm quite happy with that." [...] Minogue has been declared by media as a sex symbol.|$|E

2500|$|G. W. Hoover and Captain Lee later {{composed}} their differences. [...] Lee and Hoover {{came together}} to The Oregonian {{on the evening of}} November7, 1893. [...] Hoover said that he was now satisfied, from the testimony of the other witnesses, that Lee <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> he could have to save the people in the accident. [...] Hoover also said that he had obtained the dismissal of the criminal charges which Hoover had brought against Lee. [...] Lee denied that he had dragged Hoover to the morgue, and said that Hoover had gone willingly.|$|E
2500|$|Connolly {{also bought}} a house in Windsor, Berkshire. [...] "I left Scotland and came to live here, because of the {{break-up}} of my marriage," [...] Connolly said in 1992. [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> {{that it was possible to}} do — well, certainly everything I wanted to do. I had filled the concert halls, I had done the television that I wanted to do, and I'd done the film that I wanted to do. And in order to grow, I had to move away. I'm still as big there as I ever was. Bigger, probably, but I don't live there anymore and don't go there as often as I used to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dalí {{was cast}} as the Emperor. Dalí later demanded to be paid $100,000 per hour; Jodorowsky agreed, but {{tailored}} Dalí's part to be filmed in one hour, drafting plans for other scenes of the emperor to use a mechanical mannequin as substitute for Dalí. According to Giger, Dalí was [...] "later invited to leave the film because of his pro-Franco statements". Just as the storyboards, designs, and script were finished, the financial backing dried up. Frank Herbert traveled to Europe in 1976 to find that $2 million of the $9.5 million budget had already been spent in pre-production, and that Jodorowsky's script {{would result in a}} 14-hour movie ("It {{was the size of a}} phone book", Herbert later recalled). Jodorowsky took creative liberties with the source material, but Herbert said that he and Jodorowsky had an amicable relationship. Jodorowsky said in 1985 that he found the Dune story mythical and had intended to recreate it rather than adapt the novel; though he had an [...] "enthusiastic admiration" [...] for Herbert, Jodorowsky said he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> possible to distance the author and his input from the project. Although Jodorowsky was embittered by the experience, he stated that the Dune project changed his life. O'Bannon entered a psychiatric hospital after the production failed, and worked on 13 scripts; the last of which became Alien. A 2013 documentary, Jodorowsky's Dune, was made about Jodorowsky's failed attempt at an adaptation.|$|E
