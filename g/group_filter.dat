Therefore the noise removal and correction is an important processing required before performing any subsequent image processing approaches in the image data.

30|$|MapReduce is a {{powerful}} abstraction for simple tasks, e.g. word counting, {{that have to be}} applied to colossal amounts of data. This was its initial purpose: reverse index creation and page rankings, essentially weighted sums. More modern functionality such as supporting online social networks and data analytics are extremely cumbersome to code as a giant set of interdependent MapReduce programs. Reusability is thus very limited. To amend this, the Apache Pig platform [9] eases creation of data analysis programs. The Pig Latin language combines imperative-like script language (foreach, load, store) with SQL-like operators (<b>group,</b> <b>filter).</b> Scripts are compiled into Java programs linked to Map Reduce libraries. An example of productivity and reusability is a word counting script with 6 lines of code. The Hive [21] warehouse reinstates fully declarative SQL-like languages (HiveQL) over data in tables (stored as files in an HDFS directory). Queries are compiled into MapReduce jobs to be executed on Hadoop. SCOPE [22] takes a similar approach to scripting but targeting Dryad [17] for its execution engine.|$|E

Different from the existing methods which usually rely on complicated features or heavy learning models, our method introduces simple structure features and context groups which are very effective for Chinese text detection. Specifically, we firstly extract connected components by using the Maximally Stable Extremal Region algorithm (MSER) in multiple channels of color space and the candidate regions are generated by combining the extraction results. Secondly, we design some simple structure features which are special for Chinese characters to filter non-text candidate regions. Some detached parts of a character are merged to form a whole character in this stage. Finally, we propose the structure context clues.

40|$|Introduction {{research}} on intrapartum interventions in maternity care has focused traditionally on {{the identification of}} risk factors 2 ̆ 7 and on the reduction of adverse outcomes with less attention given to the measurement of {{factors that contribute to}} well-being and positive health outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of reviews to determine the type and number of salutogenically-focused reported outcomes in current maternity care intrapartum intervention-based research. For the conduct of this review, we interpreted salutogenic outcomes as those relating to optimum and/or positive maternal and neonatal health and well-being. Objectives to identify salutogenically-focused outcomes reported in systematic reviews of randomised trials of intrapartum interventions. Review methods we searched Issue 9 (September) 2011 of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for all reviews of intrapartum interventions published by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group using the <b>group</b> <b>filter</b> ?hm-preg?. Systematic reviews of randomised trials of intrapartum interventions were eligible for inclusion. We excluded protocols for systematic reviews and systematic reviews that had been withdrawn. Outcome data were extracted independently from each included review by at least two review authors. Unique lists of salutogenically and non-salutogenically focused outcomes were established. Results 16 salutogenically-focused outcome categories were identified in 102 included reviews. Maternal satisfaction and breast feeding were reported most frequently. 49 non-salutogenically-focused outcome categories were identified in the 102 included reviews. Measures of neonatal morbidity were reported most frequently. Conclusion there is an absence of salutogenically-focused outcomes reported in intrapartum intervention-based research.

40|$|Objective: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a well-accepted {{treatment}} for atherosclerotic stenosis of carotid arteries. Since {{the occurrence of}} distal embolization with CAS is still a major concern embolus protection devices (EPD) are usually employed during the procedure. We examined two types of embolus protection filters (Angioguard XP (AG); Filterwire EZ (FW)) and evaluated the function. Thus, the filter was examined postoperatively {{and the cause of}} intraoperative flow impairment was evaluated. Materials and methods: CAS was performed for 54 patients with carotid artery stenosis (55 lesions: 25 AG; 27 FW; 3 others). After completing CAS the filter membrane was stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) solution and removed from the filter strut. Once mounted on a glass slide the filter was evaluated under a microscope. The area occupied with debris was measured and the relationship to intraoperative flow impairment was evaluated. Furthermore, the relationship between perioperative ischemic complications and intraoperative flow impairment was statistically analyzed. Results: Microscopic observation of the slide revealed the pore density of the FW was 1. 5 times higher than that of the AG and the filter area of the FW was 2. 5 times wider than than the AG. HE staining facilitated characterization of the debris composition. The area occupied with debris was significantly more in the AG (0. 241 ± 0. 13 cm 2) than in the FW (0. 129 ± 0. 093 cm 2). Thus, fibrin was significantly more precipitated in the AG. Flow impairment occurred in 6 AG cases (24. 0 %) and 4 FW cases (14. 8 %). It was induced by filter obstruction in the AG and by vasospasms in the FW. Three cases treated with AG (12. 0 %) were complicated with cerebral infarction and all of them were related to flow impairment. One FW case (3. 7 %) was complicated with cerebral infarction in presence of preserved flow throughout the intervention. Conclusion: Filter function is different according to each design. The cause of flow impairment was attributable to filter obstruction in the AG group and to vasospasms in the FW <b>group.</b> <b>Filter</b> obstruction tends to result in cerebral infarction...|$|E

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of retrievable vena cava filters plus anticoagulation vs anticoagulation alone for preventing pulmonary embolism recurrence in patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism and {{a high risk of}} recurrence. Randomized, open-label, blinded end point trial (PREPIC 2) with 6 -month follow-up conducted from August 2006 to January 2013. Hospitalized patients with acute, symptomatic pulmonary embolism associated with lower-limb vein thrombosis and at least 1 criterion for severity were assigned to retrievable inferior vena cava filter implantation plus anticoagulation (filter group; n[*]=[*] 200) or anticoagulation alone with no filter implantation (control group; n[*]=[*] 199). Initial hospitalization with ambulatory follow-up occurred in 17 French centers. Full-dose anticoagulation for at least 6 months in all patients. Insertion of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter in patients randomized to the filter <b>group.</b> <b>Filter</b> retrieval was planned at 3 months from placement. Primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were recurrent pulmonary embolism at 6 months, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis, major bleeding, death at 3 and 6 months, and filter complications. In the filter group, the filter was successfully inserted in 193 patients and was retrieved as planned in 153 of the 164 patients in whom retrieval was attempted. By 3 months, recurrent pulmonary embolism had occurred in 6 patients (3. 0 %; all fatal) in the filter group and in 3 patients (1. 5 %; 2 fatal) in the control group (relative risk with filter, 2. 00 [95 % CI, 0. 51 - 7. 89]; P[*]=[*]. 50). Results were similar at 6 months. No difference was observed between the 2 groups regarding the other outcomes. Filter thrombosis occurred in 3 patients. Among hospitalized patients with severe acute pulmonary embolism, the use of a retrievable inferior vena cava filter plus anticoagulation compared with anticoagulation alone did not reduce the risk of symptomatic recurrent pulmonary embolism at 3 months.
