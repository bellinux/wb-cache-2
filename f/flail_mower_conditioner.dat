50|$|Such large hedge {{trimmers}} {{are often}} confused with tractor-mounted reach <b>flail</b> <b>mowers</b> (booms with <b>flail</b> <b>mower</b> attachments), which appear similar {{due to the}} use of booms. And in colloquial language both, tractor-mounted hedge trimmers and reach <b>flail</b> <b>mowers,</b> are imprecisely called hedge cutters, or brush cutters. In contrast to tractor-mounted hedge trimmers, reach <b>flail</b> <b>mowers</b> have a different cutting mechanism, and are not only used for trimming hedges, but also in several other fields of application (mowing taller grass, road verge cutting, ditch maintenance, etc.).|$|R

40|$|The <b>flail</b> <b>mower</b> is a {{piece of}} {{agricultural}} equipment that uses bladed attachments rotating around a drum to cut down bushes and grassy terrain. One major drawback to the <b>flail</b> <b>mower</b> is the rapid wear that happens almost immediately when any sort of rocks, gravel, or rough terrain are encountered. The goal of this project was to design and manufacture a prototype of a machine that could level rough terrain through repeating impacts as opposed to cutting with blades. The final design was a chain <b>flail</b> <b>mower,</b> a piece of equipment designed to level rough terrain that uses chains to repeatedly bludgeon rocks, gravel, and debris. The designed chain <b>flail</b> <b>mower</b> was assembled into an existing commercially available snow blower for testing. by Aaron Flores. Thesis: S.

50|$|If a flail strikes an {{immovable}} object, {{it simply}} bounces off. Other rotary type mowers {{have a tendency}} to grab and throw the object out of the mower deck if its small enough. This fact makes the <b>flail</b> <b>mower</b> best suited for areas where thrown objects would cause damage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flail</b> <b>mowers</b> have {{a number}} of small blades on the end of chains {{attached}} to a horizontal axis. The cutting is carried out by the ax-like heads striking the grass at speed. These types are used on rough ground, where the blades may frequently be fouled by other objects, or on tougher vegetation than grass, such as brush (scrub). Due to the length of the chains and the higher weight of the blades, they are better at cutting thick brush than other mowers, because of the relatively high inertia of the blades. In some types the cut material may be gathered in a collection bin. As a boom mower (see above), a <b>flail</b> <b>mower</b> may be used in an upright position for trimming the sides of hedges, when it is often called a hedge-cutter.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>flail</b> <b>mower</b> {{gets its}} name from the use of [...] "flails" [...] {{attached}} to its rotating horizontal drum (also called tube, rotor, or axle). Many implement companies also refer to the flails as knives or blades. The rows of flails are usually staggered to provide a complete cut. The flails are attached to the drum using chain links or brackets, depending on the manufacturer. The rotating drum is perpendicular to the axis of the tractor. The PTO driveshaft along the tractor's axis must make a right angle {{through the use of a}} gearbox in order to transfer its rotational energy to the drum. As the drum rotates, centrifugal force pushes the flails outward.|$|R
40|$|Noise in {{agriculture}} {{is one of}} the risk factors {{to be taken into account}} in the assessment of the health and safety of workers; in particular, it is known that the tractor is a source of high noise. The Italian Low Decree 81 / 2008 defined the requirements for assessing and managing noise risk identifying a number of procedures to be adopted at different noise levels to limit workers exposure. This paper concerns the analysis of the noise risk arising from the use of a tracklaying tractor during field operations carried out in the vineyard. The objective of this study was to evaluate the noise level that comes close to the ear of the operator driving the tractor measuring the values of equivalent sound level (Leq(A)) and peak sound pressure (LCpk). We considered four options related to the same tractor coupled with the following tools to perform some farming operations: rototilling, chisel plough, <b>flail</b> <b>mowers</b> and vibro farmer. We considered three test conditions: T 1 in flat (slope 0 %), T 2 uphill and T 3 downhill (both 30 % slope). The instrument used for the measurements is a precision integrating portable sound level meter, class 1, model HD 2110 L by Delta OHM, Italy. Each survey lasted 2 minutes, with an interval of measurement equal to 0. 5 s. The tests were performed in compliance with the standards ISO 9612 and ISO 9432. The results show that the measured sound levels exceed the limits allowed by the regulations in almost all the test conditions; values exceeding the threshold limit of 80 dB(A) were recorded coming up to a maximum value of 92. 8 dB(A) for <b>flail</b> <b>mowers</b> in test T 1.

5000|$|Native Americans {{regularly}} burnt away {{trees and}} shrubs in parts of eastern Maine, in order to stimulate blueberry production. Modern farmers use various methods of burning or mowing to accomplish this. There {{are a number of}} methods grower use to stimulate blueberry production on their land such as burning the land or by using a <b>flail</b> <b>mower,</b> bush hog, lawn mower, etc. to cut the plants off as close to the ground as possible without scalping the land. These procedures are used to promote the spreading of rhizomes under the soil. Some growers use a sickle bar mower in the fall after the crop has been harvested to mow the plants off leaving roughly 1 to 2 inches of stem so the growers can then burn the remaining of the plants in the spring using less fuel for the fire.|$|R

50|$|For {{production}} agriculture, {{past and}} present, two-wheel tractors accept {{a wide range}} of implements, such as the following: For soil-working: rototillers, moldboard plows, disc-plows, rotary plows, root/tuber harvesting plows, small subsoiler plows, powered and non-powered harrows, seeders, transplanters, and planters. Even zero till/no-till planters and seeders have become available. In plant protection and weed control, two-wheel tractor implements consist of various inter-cultivators and sprayers. For harvesting, available implements are: Forage: Sickle bar mowers, disk mowers, hayrakes, hay tedders, haybalers and bale wrappers silage production. For grain harvest: reaper/grain harvesters, reaper-binders, and even combine harvesters are available typically only for Asian two-wheel tractors. For transport, trailers with capacities from 0.5 to 5 plus ton cargoes are available. General mowing implements consist of lawn mowers, brush <b>mowers,</b> and <b>flail</b> <b>mowers.</b> For snow removal, implements consist of snowblowers, power sweepers, and snow/dozer blades. Other implements include: chipper/shredders, log splitters, electrical generator, pressure washer, crimper-roller, fertilizer/salt/lime spreader, and stump grinder. This list of implements (which may not be complete) means that two-wheel tractors can execute practically all of the chores done by larger 4-wheel tractors, with the exception of items like front-loaders, which obviously have the physical stability requirements of a 4-wheel (two-axle) tractor.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{evaluating}} {{the intensity of}} Tifton 85 conditioning using a <b>mower</b> <b>conditioner</b> with free-swinging <b>flail</b> fingers and storage times on dehydration curve, fungi presence, nutritional value and in vitro digestibility of Tifton 85 bermudagrass hay dry matter (DM). The dehydration curve was determined in the whole plant for ten times until the baling. The zero time corresponded to the plant before cutting, which occurred at 11 : 00 and the other collections were carried out at 8 : 00, 10 : 00, 14 : 00, and 16 : 00. The experimental design was randomised blocks with two intensities of conditioning (high and low) and ten sampling times, with five replications. The high and low intensities related to adjusting the deflector plate of the free iron fingers (8 and 18 cm). In order to determine gas exchanges during Tifton 85 bermudagrass dehydration, there were evaluations of mature leaves, which {{were placed in the}} upper middle third of each branch before the cutting, at every hour for 4 hours. A portable gas analyser was used by an infrared IRGA (6400 xt). The analysed variables were photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (gs), internal CO 2 concentration (Ci), transpiration (T), water use efficiency (WUE), and intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi). In the second part of this study, the nutritional value of Tifton 85 hay was evaluated, so randomised blocks were designed in a split plot through time, with two treatments placed in the following plots: high and low intensity of cutting and five different time points as subplots: cutting (additional treatment), baling and after 30, 60, and 90 days of storage. Subsequently, fungi that were in green plants as well as hay were determined and samples were collected from the grass at the cutting period, during baling, and after 30, 60, and 90 days of storage. It was observed that Tifton 85 bermudagrass dehydration occurred within 49 hours, so this was considered the best time for drying hay. Gas exchanges were more intense before cutting, although after cutting they decreased until ceasing within 4 hours. The lowest values of acid detergent insoluble nitrogen were obtained with low conditioning intensity after 30 days of storage, 64. 8 g/kg DM. The in vitro dry matter of Tifton 85 bermudagrass did not differ among the storage times or the conditioning intensities. There was no fungi present in the samples collected during the storage period up to 90 days after dehydration, with less than 30 colony forming units found on plate counting. The use of <b>mower</b> <b>conditioners</b> in different intensities of injury did not speed up the dehydration time of Tifton 85...|$|R
50|$|A {{conditioner}} {{is made up}} of two grooved rollers {{which the}} hay is forced through, causing the stalks to split, thus allowing the liquid trapped behind cell walls (sap and cell sap) to leak out and also giving more surface area for evaporation. The stand-alone conditioner is no longer used on most farms, since the conditioner has been incorporated into mower-conditioners, which combine the <b>mower</b> and <b>conditioner</b> into a single machine. The names Haybine and Discbine are brand names of mower-conditioners, although some farmers use these names somewhat generically.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} transmissions, {{often called}} gearboxes to reflect their simplicity (although complex systems are also called gearboxes in the vernacular), provide gear reduction (or, more rarely, {{an increase in}} speed), sometimes {{in conjunction with a}} right-angle change in direction of the shaft (typically in helicopters, see picture). These are often used on PTO-powered agricultural equipment, since the axial PTO shaft is at odds with the usual need for the driven shaft, which is either vertical (as with rotary mowers), or horizontally extending {{from one side of the}} implement to another (as with manure spreaders, <b>flail</b> <b>mowers,</b> and forage wagons). More complex equipment, such as silage choppers and snowblowers, have drives with outputs in more than one direction.The gearbox in a wind turbine converts the slow, high-torque rotation of the turbine into much faster rotation of the electrical generator. These are much larger and more complicated than the PTO gearboxes in farm equipment. They weigh several tons and typically contain three stages to achieve an overall gear ratio from 40:1 to over 100:1, depending on the size of the turbine. (For aerodynamic and structural reasons, larger turbines have to turn more slowly, but the generators all have to rotate at similar speeds of several thousand rpm.) The first stage of the gearbox is usually a planetary gear, for compactness, and to distribute the enormous torque of the turbine over more teeth of the low-speed shaft. Durability of these gearboxes has been a serious problem for a long time.|$|R
40|$|The {{universal}} {{adoption of}} biomass materials as an alternate fuel source to fossil fuels for transportation and electricity has been hindered {{by the high}} transportation costs involved in fuel production. Optimization of these initial costs will make the eco-friendly fuels more economically viable.

Among the most studied grassland crops, switchgrass is a perennial warm-season grass and has been identified as a potential energy crop. This research focuses on evaluating various physical parameters which affect the economic feasibility of packaging and transporting switchgrass from the field to the biorefinery. The switchgrass was harvested using a <b>mower</b> <b>conditioner</b> followed by field chopping after varying drying periods. The first harvesting period spanned from early November to mid December 2007 and the second was August to October 2008. Densification properties of chopped switchgrass were studied under compression. The effects of compressive stresses (41 to 101 kPa), number of strokes (1 to 10), moisture content (9 to 62 percent) and chopping length (63 and 95 mm) on the densification of chopped switchgrass were studied. The final dry matter density (DMD) increased with the compressive stresses and the number of strokes, small chop length and low moisture content.

40|$|Round-bale silage {{harvesting}} {{and processing}} methods were assessed to evaluate overwintering ability and dry matter (DM) yield, fermentation quality and palatability of overwintered dwarf Napiergrass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach) {{in the two}} years following establishment in Nagasaki, Japan, in May 2013 using rooted tillers with a density of 2 plants/m 2. In 2014, harvesting methods under no-wilting treatment were compared for flail-type harvesting with a round-baler (Flail/baler plot) and mower conditioning with a round-baler (Mower/baler plot), which is common for beef-calf–producing farmers in the region. In 2015, the effect of ensilage with wilting was investigated only in the Mower/baler plot. Dwarf Napiergrass was cut twice, in early August (summer) and late November (late autumn), each year. The winter survival rate was greater than 96 % in May both years. The DM yield in the Mower/baler plot did not differ significantly for the first summer cutting or the annual total from the Flail/baler plot, but did show inferior yield for the second cutting. The fermentation quality of the second-cut plants, estimated using the V 2 -score, was higher in the Flail/baler plot than in the Mower/baler plot, possibly because of higher air-tightness, and the second-cut silage tended to have better fermentation quality than the first-cut silage in both harvesting plots. Wilting improved the fermentation quality of dwarf Napiergrass silage in summer, but not in autumn. The palatability of the silage, as estimated by alternative and voluntary intake trials using Japanese Black beef cattle, did not differ significantly between plots. The results suggest that dwarf Napiergrass can be better harvested using a <b>mower</b> <b>conditioner</b> with processing by a round-baler, an approach common to beef-calf–producing farmers, than with the flail/baler system, without reducing the persistence, yield, or palatability of the silage. Moreover, wilting treatment improved the fermentation quality of the dwarf Napiergrass silage when processed in summer...|$|R
40|$|Herbicides are an {{important}} part of natural resource management. However, the environmental and social limitations of this tool in a land management setting are often not fully understood by either the general public or those responsible for the handling and safe use of herbicides. Educating both users and the general public is the responsibility of herbicide manufacturers, their distribution infrastructure, natural resources managers, and academic researchers. In 2003 Purdue University developed a research project in Tippecanoe County, Indiana that focused on the development and implementation of an integrated vegetation management process that would control invasive woody plants and establish prairie species. A significant portion of this research evolved from the requests of different natural resource managers. Their input and experiences were incorporated into treatments in an effort to enhance the integrated process, improve the applications of research, and educate as many managers as possible. ^ To understand the limitations of prairie establishment, native warm-season grasses and forbs were planted in 2003 - 2005, paired with various imazapic herbicide treatments. The use of imazapic enhanced both the density and diversity of grasses established. Forb density and diversity was reduced with the use of imazapic, and forb diversity was generally low in all treatments. ^ Simultaneous with the prairie establishment research, experiments were completed to determine appropriate control measures for woody invasive plants. Dormant season treatments on non-native species such as Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), autumn olive (Elaeagnus umbellata), and multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora), and the invasive native species black cherry (Prunus serotina) resulted in 100 % control of the stems treated. These results suggest that dormant season herbicide control methods are a useful tool for invasive plant control, specifically when used as part of an integrated plan. ^ A final research trial was designed to test the integration of native plant establishment and invasive plant control techniques developed from the previous experiments. Previously tested methods were used as the first step in establishing a grassland savanna from a mid-successional brushland dominated by invasive woody plants (90. 4 % of the woody plants inventoried were invasive). My objectives for this study were to efficiently control the invasive woody plants, preserve the oak overstory, and establish native grasses within 2 growing seasons (18 months). These objectives were successfully met through the use of general-use forestry herbicides in an integrated vegetation management approach. The process included the use of a <b>flail</b> <b>mower</b> to reduce the biomass of the woody plants and a Truax Rough Rider Range Land Drill to plant the uneven terrain complexed by stumps, logs, and woody debris. ...|$|R
