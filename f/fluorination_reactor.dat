40|$|Abstract. The {{article is}} devoted to the {{adaptation}} of the controller parameters during its operation {{as a part of a}} control loop. The possibility to identify the parameters of the controlled plant model in the closed control loop has been proved by a computer simulation. The described active identification method is based on the response processing of the closed loop control system to standard actions. The developed algorithm has been applied to determine the model parameters of the flaming <b>fluorination</b> <b>reactor</b> used for the production of uranium hexafluoride. Designed identification method improves the quality of the product and the efficiency of the entire production...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} fluorination of trichloroethylene in anhydrous {{hydrogen fluoride}} at 0 C and at constant cell potential was investigated. A microprocessor-aided electrochemical <b>fluorination</b> <b>reactor</b> system that yields highly reproducible results was utilized. The following major two-carbon-chain products were observed: CHCl 2 -CCl 2 F, CHCl 2 -CClF 2, CHClF-CCl 2 F, and CCl 2 F-CClF 2. The {{first step in}} the reaction sequence was determined to be fluorine addition to the double bond, followed by replacement of first hydrogen and then chlorine by fluorine. Polymerization reactions yielded higher molecular weight or possible ring-type chlorofluorohydrocarbons. A comparison of the reaction products of electrochemical and chemical fluorinations of trichloroethylene is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFluoride Volatility Method is {{regarded}} to be a promising advanced pyrochemical reprocessing technology, {{which can be}} used for reprocessing mainly of oxide spent fuels coming from current LWRs or future GEN IV fast reactors. The technology should be chiefly suitable for the reprocessing of advanced oxide fuels with inert matrixes of very high burn-up and short cooling time, which can be hardly reprocessed by hydrometallurgical technologies. Fluoride Volatility Method is based on direct fluorination of powdered spent fuel with fluorine gas in a flame <b>fluorination</b> <b>reactor,</b> where the volatile fluorides (mostly UF 6) are separated from the non-volatile ones (trivalent minor actinides and majority of fission products). The subsequent operations necessary for partitioning of volatile fluorides are condensation and evaporation of volatile fluorides, thermal decomposition of PuF 6 and finally distillation and sorption used for the purification of uranium product...|$|E

Here, {{we report on}} the use of a modular cryo-flow device as applied to a diastereoselective <b>fluorination</b> process.

40|$|Multivalent conversion-based {{transition}} metal (TM) compounds have significantly higher specific capacity {{due to their}} multiple red-ox states contributing towards transfer of> 1 lithium per {{transition metal}} atom. 1 - 2 Iron oxides (Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4) are examples of such high capacity conversion electrodes having other advantages such as low cost, natural abundance and environmental benignity. 3 A relatively lower redox potential with respect to Li/Li+ makes them more suitable as anodes for lithium batteries. 4 On the other hand, their fluoride counterparts such as FeF 3 have higher redox potential, and capacity contribution derived from intercalation and conversion mechanisms. The major drawback of iron fluoride is their poor electronic conductivity due to the higher ionicity of the Fe-F bonds. 5 One of the approaches for overcoming this barrier is developing synthesis methods for converting fluorides to oxyfluorides. 6 In this work, we demonstrate a novel approach where we use a direct fluorination method to convert iron oxides to oxyfluoride using a fluidized bed <b>reactor.</b> <b>Fluorination</b> of nano-Fe 3 O 4 (n-Fe 3 O 4) powder was carried out using a fluidized bed reactor by controlling F 2 partial pressure and reaction temperature (T). XPS study confirmed that with increase in fluorination temperatures, more F was introduced into Fe 3 O 4 with concomitant reduction of surface oxygen species, especially for T>...|$|R
30|$|All {{chemicals}} {{were from}} commercial vendors in pharmaceutical grade. Production of [18 F]flumazenil {{was based on}} the method by Moon et al. [38]. [18 F]fluoride in [18 O]water was produced by a medical cyclotron (PETtrace- 18, GE Healthcare) and passed through a PS-HCO 3 cartridge, and eluted with a K 222 /K 2 CO 3 phase transfer catalyst solution in the chemical module (Tracelab FX-FN, GE Healthcare). After azeotropic evaporation, 4  mg of flumazenil diaryliodonium tosylate salt precursor (Bio Imaging Korea Co., Ltd., Seoul, South Korea) in 1  mL of DMF with Tempo (1  mg) was added to the <b>reactor.</b> <b>Fluorination</b> proceeded for 5  min at 150  °C, whereupon the reaction mixture was diluted with 10  mL of water and passed twice through a C 18 plus cartridge (Waters). The radiolabeled product was then eluted from the C 18 cartridge with acetonitrile and diluted with sterile water. The crude solution was purified on a Luna C 18 semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC column (Phenomenex, 5  μm, 250 [*]×[*] 10  mm) with a mobile phase (acetonitrile/water[*]=[*] 20 : 80) delivered at 5  mL/min. Purified [18 F]flumazenil was collected as the radiochemical peak eluting at 22  min, in a round bottom flask prefilled with 25  mL water for formulation. The diluted fraction was passed through the C 18 plus cartridge and rinsed with water. The product was eluted with 1.5  mL of 100 % USP grade ethanol and diluted by 15  mL of USP grade saline, giving a final concentration below 10 % ethanol in sterile physiological saline. [18 F]flumazenil showed ≥ 99 % radiochemical purity, specific activity of 264 [*]±[*] 100  GBq/μmol (n[*]=[*] 3) at end of synthesis (EOS), and a decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 34 [*]±[*] 22 % (n[*]=[*] 3).|$|R
