25|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} on the Syrian side {{have been}} conducted {{as part of the}} Land of Carchemish project: investigations of the Outer Town of Carchemish were undertaken in conjunction with the DGAM in Damascus and with the funding and sponsorship of the Council for British Research in the Levant and of the British Academy, {{under the direction of the}} late Professors T. J. Wilkinson and E. Peltenburg. The Outer Town area lying in Syria has been designated an endangered cultural heritage site and labelled “at risk” by the Global Heritage Fund, due to the agricultural expansion and, especially, the urban encroachment. The <b>field</b> <b>assessment</b> of the Syrian part of the Outer Town documented that parts of the modern border town of Jerablus encroached upon the Outer Town. In February 2016, a prefabricated security wall (thus with no foundations that could have damaged the ancient site) has been completed by the Turkish Army to the south of the railway, stretching between the Euphrates bridge and the train station of Karkamış.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, {{the total}} Armenian {{population}} of the districts of Kalbajar, Lachin, Qubadli, Zangilan, Jabrayil, Fuzuli and Agdam was around 1,400 people. An OSCE fact-finding mission established at Azerbaijan's request visited these regions in February 2005 with the intention to assess {{the scale of the}} settlement attempts. The mission's findings showed that these districts had as of 2005 an overall population of 14,000 persons, mostly living in precarious social conditions. It consisted primarily of ethnic Armenians displaced from non-conflict zones of Azerbaijan during the war. It was noted, however, that most of them had settled in the conflict zone after having lived in Armenia for several years and some held Armenian passports and even voted in Armenian elections. A smaller segment of the settlers were originally from the towns of Gyumri and Spitak in Armenia who had lived in temporary shelters following the devastating 1988 earthquake before moving to Karabakh, as well as a small number of natives of Yerevan who moved there for financial reasons. A <b>field</b> <b>assessment</b> mission revisited the region in October 2010, confirming that there had not been much growth in population or change in living conditions of the settlers. The Co-Chairs of the Minsk Group who visited Artsakh, Kalbajar and Lachin in 2014 reported seeing signs of improvements in infrastructure, but could not observe any indications that the size of the population had changed in recent years.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} driver-ride and road-friendliness {{characteristics}} {{of an urban}} bus through model derivation and validation, sensitivity analysis, suspension damping optimisation and <b>field</b> <b>assessments.</b> Part I of the study develops a three-dimensional urban bus model by integrating non-linear models of suspension components and tyres that were derived from laboratory-measured data. The vehicle model is validated through field tests, and employed for sensitivity analyses of different operating parameters, including forward speed, tyre inflation pressure, vehicle load and road roughness. The results demonstrate significant roles of these parameters on the dynamic responses relating to driver ride and road-friendliness, which are coupled in a complex manner. The results suggest that measures related to sustainability of urban infrastructure and vehicle structure, together with {{the health and safety}} of the drivers, are directly coupled in light of the road roughness.

40|$|Across the tropics, {{there is}} a growing {{financial}} investment in activities that aim to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, such as REDD+. However, most tropi-cal countries lack on-the-ground capacity to conduct reliable and replicable assessments of forest carbon stocks, undermining their ability to secure long-term carbon finance for forest conservation programs. Clear guidance on how to reduce the monetary and time costs of <b>field</b> <b>assessments</b> of forest carbon can help tropical countries to overcome this capacity gap. Here we provide such guidance for cost-effective one-off <b>field</b> <b>assessments</b> of forest carbon stocks. We sampled a total of eight components from four different carbon pools (i. e. aboveground, dead wood, litter and soil) in 224 study plots distributed across two regions of eastern Amazon.

This is, for example, because the foraging behaviour of EPNs is less important for the attack of host insects in small arenas of bioassays, than under field conditions. Field conditions also require a longer survival of EPNs without the host, i.e. before finding the host, than in small arena bioassays.|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown the {{usefulness}} of hyperspectral crop reflectance data for detecting plant pathological stress. However, {{there is still a}} need to identify unique signatures for specific stresses amidst the constantly changing background associated with normal crop growth and development. Comparing spatial and temporal patterns in crop spectra can provide such signatures. This work is concerned with characterizing and estimating fungal disease severity in a spring wheat crop. This goal can be accomplished by using a reference data set consisting of hyperspectral crop reflectance data vectors and the corresponding disease severity <b>field</b> <b>assessments.</b> The hyperspectral vectors are first normalised into zero-mean and unit-variance vectors by performing various combinations of spectral- and band-wise normalisations. Then, after applying the same normalisation procedures to the new hyperspectral data, a nearest neighbour classifier is used to classify the new data against the reference data. Finally, the corresponding stress signatures are computed using a linear transformation model. High correlation is obtained between the classification results and the corresponding <b>field</b> <b>assessments</b> of fungal disease severity, confirming the usefulness and efficiency of this approach. The effects of increased disease severity can be characterised by analysing the resulting disease signatures obtained when applying the different normalisation procedures. The low computational load of this approach makes it suitable for real-time on-vehicle applications. ...|$|R
