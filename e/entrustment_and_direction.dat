40|$|As residents, we {{constantly}} {{strive to}} independently manage our patients and develop care plans, while {{the role of}} the attending faculty varies between complete supervision and control, to allowing complete autonomy. This concept of attending physicians allowing appropriate autonomy so that residents can develop independence in their practice has been termed <b>entrustment.</b> Patients' <b>and</b> instructors' <b>entrustment</b> of responsibility reflects upon one's preparedness to assume professional responsibility after graduation. Over the past several months, we have been reflecting on our experiences working in the emergency department and how different faculty members entrust residents during each shift. Some experiences have been incredible as we develop our styles of practice, while others have been incredibly frustrating and soured the learning environment. As third‐year residents, we studied the factors that allow faculty to foster an appropriate amount of <b>entrustment</b> <b>and</b> conducted discussions with multiple residents on this topic. We have found several themes of how this can be done well and share these ideas with a goal of improving autonomy for emergency medicine residents...|$|R
40|$|PhDThis study {{focuses on}} the {{particular}} course taken by the theory of sexual difference (il pensiero della differenza sessuale) in Italy. It examines Italian feminism as a current which has received hitherto little international attention. The {{first part of the}} thesis situates Italian feminism in relation to the more familiar French and Anglo-American contexts in order to consider its distinctiveness. The main body of the study then considers the historical and political emergence of contemporary Italian feminism, the elaboration of a social-symbolic practice called "entrustment" ("affidamento"), beginning in 1983, and the hegemony achieved by the theory of sexual difference amongst the majority of feminist groups. Here, I develop the central argument of the thesis: it is the elaboration of entrustment which has first occasioned contemporary Italian feminism, as a whole, to engage with a theory of sexual difference adapted to the highly politicised Italian context. The last section of the thesis critically evaluates <b>entrustment</b> <b>and</b> the symbolic order of the Mother created by it, and considers the debates surrounding such a social-symbolic practice. Adriana Cavarero provides an original point of view on contemporary Italian feminism since she is both a fierce critic of <b>entrustment</b> <b>and</b> one of the leading exponents of ilpensiero. The final chapter thus utilises Cavarero's theory in order to postulate that entrustment is best considered as part of a plural but common Italian strategy of "practising" relationships between women. Sexual difference now becomes the political practice of restructuring the order of representation so that feminine sexual difference can be included...|$|R

Coincident with high HIV/AIDS mortality and changing economic policies for the financial services sector, Swaziland saw an influx of foreign insurance companies in the early 2000 s.

50|$|Negligence in {{employment}} differs from negligent entrustment in two key respects. First, negligent employment {{requires that the}} injury {{was caused by the}} actual employment of the party. By comparison, a party can be held liable for negligently entrusting something to any person, whether that person is an employee or not. Second, an employee can be found liable for negligent hiring, retention, supervision or training even without provision of any dangerous instrumentality to the employee. However, where an employer hires an unqualified person to engage in the use of a dangerous instrumentality, as in the above example with the bus driver, the employer may be liable for both negligent <b>entrustment</b> <b>and</b> negligent hiring.|$|R

A growing proportion of aid budgets is going to fragile and conflict-affected states and conflict prevention is becoming an important focus of aid spend even in countries that are not affected by widespread violence. Thus, there is a rationale for development and security being increasingly brought together. The issue is {{how to do this}} most effectively to promote the security of the poor. While development in violent environments is very different from development in stable and peaceful areas, {{the same is true for}} security. One of the key differences is the fragmentation of power and authority which makes it more difficult for outsiders to operate.

40|$|The {{expression}} of Public Service Obligations (PSO) {{in the network}} sectors of SGEIs are defined by the normative values of a good administrative protocol with sectoral rules set out in EU legislation. The Europeanisation of these sectors provides a coherent base which informs the national approaches in providing for acts of <b>entrustment</b> <b>and</b> the establishment of independent national regulatory agencies. This paper examines {{the development of this}} model and provides a comparison with the approach taken in economic social services sectors where Member States face a developing imperative to designate essential SSGI as SGEI. This is a social services environment in which a growing Public Service Industry is increasingly seeing private sector economic actors enjoy a general advantage over third sector not-for-profit and charity entities, in the public procurement processes. The comparison highlights the significant differences in the way that PSOs are expressed between the network SGEIs and the ‘social’ SGEIs and raises a question of whether it is time to consider, in at least some social services sectors, whether the {{expression of}} PSOs should be re-modelled {{in such a way as}} to replicate those in the network SGEI sectors...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs) are {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} focus for assessment in graduate medical education (GME). However, a consistent approach to guide EPA design is currently lacking, in particular concerning the actual content (knowledge, skills and attitude required for specific tasks) for EPAs. This paper describes a comprehensive five stage approach, which was used to develop two specialty-specific EPAs in emergency medicine focused on {{the first year of}} GME. METHODS: The five stage approach was used to gain consensus on the task, content <b>and</b> <b>entrustment</b> scale for two specialty-specific EPAs in emergency medicine. The participants consisted of twelve clinical supervisors working in the emergency department. The five stages were: 1) Selecting the EPA topic; 2) Developing the EPA content by collecting data from participants using focus group and individual interviews; 3) Drafting the EPAs based on analysis of collected data; 4) Seeking feedback on the draft EPAs from the participants and other stakeholders; 5) Refining and finalising the EPAs based on feedback. RESULTS: Two specialty-specific EPAs were developed using the five stage approach. The participants reached consensus on the specific tasks and criteria for performance for the two EPAs. They also agreed that both day-to-day (ad hoc) <b>and</b> formal (summative) <b>entrustment</b> decisions were put into practice through the intensity of supervision provided to PGY 1 doctors. As a result, a three level <b>entrustment</b> <b>and</b> supervision scale consisting of direct active, indirect active, passive was developed reflecting the shift in the intensity of supervision from close supervision to minimal supervision. CONCLUSIONS: The five stage approach described in this paper was used successfully to develop two specialty-specific EPAs in emergency medicine along with a three level entrustment scale. We propose that the five stage approach is transferable to a range of medical training contexts to design specialty-specific EPAs...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose for}} doing this {{research}} was to study the law regarding negligent hiring, retention, supervision, <b>and</b> <b>entrustment,</b> <b>and</b> to apply the principles found to campus recreation programs. ^ The elements of an action for negligent hiring and retention are essentially the same; each requires {{the establishment of an}} employment relationship. Negligent supervision <b>and</b> <b>entrustment</b> are separate torts and do not require an employment relationship. All four causes of action require that the plaintiff plead and prove a duty, breach of that duty, proximate cause of the breach resulting in injury, and actual injury, elements common to all negligence actions. Courts have established minimum standards expected of employers which assist them in avoiding liability for negligent hiring and retention. Employers must generally obtain an application form, conduct an interview, and check references at the minimum. If a position entails frequent contact with the public, access to customers 2 ̆ 7 homes, working with minors or the infirm, or use of a dangerous instrumentality (vehicle, weapon, etc.), an employer is expected to do more than the minimum required. Criminal background check, previous employment verification, education background check, and other duties may be deemed essential. ^ For campus recreation administrators, this research has many implications. First, because many students are hired, each candidate should complete an application and be interviewed (telephone or personal). Those working with children or handling money should have their backgrounds checked more thoroughly. Although not common practice, professional applicants should be required to complete an application form as well. A waiver or release should be part of every application form. The waiver should permit background investigation while also providing liability protection for both the employer and the reference. ^ Administrators should recognize employment-process warning signs. Warning signs include gaps in employment history, and incomplete application information. Administrators should also recognize their potential personal liability for their employment-related decisions. ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{graduate}} {{medical education}} (GME) programs {{have started to}} consider and adopt entrustable professional activities (EPAs) in their competency frameworks. Do EPAs also {{have a place in}} undergraduate medical education (UME) ? In this Perspective article, the authors discuss arguments in favor of the use of EPAs in UME. A competency framework that aligns UME and GME outcome expectations would allow for better integration across the educational continuum. The EPA approach would be consistent with what is known about progressive skill development. The key principles underlying EPAs, workplace learning and trust, are generalizable and would also be applicable to UME learners. Lastly, EPAs could increase transparency in the workplace regarding student abilities and help ensure safe and quality patient care. The authors also outline what UME EPAs might look like, suggesting core, specialty-specific, and elective EPAs related to core clinical residency entry expectations and learner interest. UME EPAs would be defined as essential health care activities with which one would expect to entrust a resident at the beginning of residency to perform without direct supervision. Finally, the authors recommend a refinement and expansion of the <b>entrustment</b> <b>and</b> supervision scale previously developed for GME to better incorporate the supervision expectations for UME learners. They suggest that EPAs could be operationalized for UME if UME-specific EPAs were developed <b>and</b> the <b>entrustment</b> scale were expanded...|$|R

40|$|Results from {{a recent}} field {{campaign}} are {{used to assess the}} accuracy of wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> precision estimates produced by a Doppler lidar wind retrieval algorithm. The algorithm, which is based on the traditional velocity-azimuth-display (VAD) technique, estimates the wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> measurement precision using standard error propagation techniques, assuming the input data (i. e., radial velocities) to be contaminated by random, zero-mean, errors. For this study, the lidar was configured to execute an 8 -beam plan-position-indicator (PPI) scan once every 12  min during the 6 -week deployment period. Several wind retrieval trials were conducted using different schemes for estimating the precision in the radial velocity measurements. The resulting wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> precision estimates were compared to differences in wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> between the VAD algorithm and sonic anemometer measurements taken on a nearby 300  m tower. All trials produced qualitatively similar wind fields with negligible bias but substantially different wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> precision fields. The most accurate wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> precisions were obtained when the radial velocity precision was determined by direct calculation of radial velocity standard deviation along each pointing <b>direction</b> <b>and</b> range gate of the PPI scan. By contrast, when the instrumental measurement precision is assumed to be the only contribution to the radial velocity precision, the retrievals resulted in wind speed <b>and</b> <b>direction</b> precisions that were biased far too low and were poor indicators of data quality...|$|R
