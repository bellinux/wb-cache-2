5|$|Cole faced a {{challenging}} {{time in the}} lead-up to Rio Paralympics. She reflects “I was still questioning if I was worthy to be there heading in – and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was, but it’s amazing that even after the amount of psychological sports training that I’ve had, those thoughts still {{come in and take}} you down… Usually the athletes who win are the ones who can put those thoughts aside, and tell themselves that they’ve got a good crack at winning.” Meanwhile, Cole put those thoughts aside and went on to win 6 medals at Rio.|$|E
5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} {{going out to}} bat at 5pm and Andy Roberts had just taken the second new ball. I had a really close lbw decision when I had scored about five. I knew I'd hit it but I didn't know that Robin Bailhache, the umpire, <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hit it. But thankfully he gave me not out. I went into lunch {{the next day at}} 99 not out and I was so happy to get a century with my parents and friends watching.|$|E

25|$|After having {{achieved}} this victory, Elisabeth did not stay to enjoy it, but instead {{embarked on a}} life of travel, and saw little of her children. “If I arrived at a place and <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could never leave it again, the whole stay would become hell despite being paradise”. After her son's death, she commissioned the building of a palace in Corfu which she named the Achilleion, after Homer's hero Achilles in The Iliad. After her death, the building was purchased by German Emperor Wilhelm II. Later it was acquired by the nation of Greece and converted to a museum.|$|E

500|$|... and Mohammed {{arranged}} {{to empty the}} flat and when my brother asked where his mother's furniture had gone to, {{she said it was}} on a boat to Tunisia where {{it was going to be}} sold. My brother was distraught. This was cruel emotional blackmail. In fact, the furniture was in storage in Cannes, but my brother never <b>knew</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> have just managed to get hold of the key.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not {{indifferent}} about it, my dear. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did right, but <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{could do}} {{right under the}} same circumstances again." ...|$|R

500|$|Finn's {{men were}} trying to fight back by using the machine guns mounted in the PBYs, either by firing from inside the flaming planes or by {{detaching}} the guns and mounting them on improvised stands. Finn later explained {{that one of the}} first things he did was to take control of a machine gun from his squadron's painter. [...] "I said, 'Alex, let me take that gun'... <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had more experience firing a machine gun than a painter." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I loved {{working in}} a team because {{swimming}} isn't considered a team sport," [...] Cole told an interviewer in 2013. [...] "I definitely wanted a new challenge because when you've been competing for a decade the increments of improvements are quite small. However, in wheelchair basketball I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could make big improvements. I've been chosen for the women's national league team, which is great, so I'm actually getting somewhere, which is a surprise. But my heart is definitely in swimming and I think it always will be." ...|$|E
500|$|After her {{departure}} from the adult film industry and transition to mainstream films, Lords got signed for a development deal with Capitol Records, but was later dropped due to disagreements {{between her and the}} label. [...] "They wanted to market me in the way that would make the most money. They wanted to make me the new Samantha Fox. And I never wanted that. That wasn't what it was about for me. I pretty much had a sense of myself, and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be an imposter," [...] Lords said.|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} credit family members with {{introducing}} them to rock music through old collections of vinyl records. [...] Boone Daughdrill cites [...] "When the Levee Breaks" [...] as his biggest influence. [...] "When I heard that drum fill {{come in the}} intro...oh! [...] I {{was a little kid}} and my uncle had all of the Zeppelin records. He was a drummer too and he would always be like, 'Man, check these guys out.'

After Linda died, Paul stated in the Daily Mail, [...] "I got a counsellor because I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would need some help. He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [...] perfect all the time... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. We were just a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{later years}} I {{learned that he}} had always liked me and thought I was worth educating, {{and for that reason}} he made an effort on this trip to get to know me. He did it cleverly. He <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was bewildered by some of the things {{expected}} of me as a candidate's wife ... Largely because of Louis' early interpretation of the standards and ethics of the newspaper business, I came to look with interest and confidence on the writing fraternity ... I did receive an intensive education on this trip, and Louis Howe played a great part in this education from that time on.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on April 23, 1971. Melvin Van Peebles stated that [...] "at first, only two theaters in the United States would show the picture: one in Detroit, and one in Atlanta. The first night in Detroit, it broke all the theater's records, and that was only {{on the strength of}} the title alone, since nobody had seen it yet. By the second day, people would take their lunch and sit through it three times. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was finally talking to my audience. Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song made thousands of dollars in its first day." [...] The film grossed $15,000,000+ at the box office (about $90 million in 2016 dollars).|$|E
500|$|Loup {{was born}} December 19, 1987, in Raceland, Louisiana. His father and {{grandfather}} influenced his baseball interest the most when he was young, {{and he says that}} it was [...] "just all baseball all the time", with [...] "a little football". Loup said that when he was thirteen, [...] "My dad had me in the backyard almost every day—or at least it seemed that way. I was always doing something, whether it was pitching off the mound or hitting in the cage. I wanted to play baseball and <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed to work hard to get there. As a kid, I needed to be reminded of that sometimes." [...] His baseball role models growing up were Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, and Tom Glavine.|$|E
500|$|At the time, Warner Bros. had a {{deal with}} Inherit Productions, the {{production}} arm of Schwaid-Merenstein which was founded by manager Bob Schwaid (who worked for Warners Publishing) and producer Lewis Merenstein. Merenstein {{received a call from}} Warner Bros. to go see Morrison in [...] Boston and related how eight or nine producers had gone to hear Morrison thinking they were going to hear [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] and [...] "it was another person with the same voice". Merenstein first heard Morrison play at Ace Recording studio and recalled that when [...] Morrison played the song [...] "Astral Weeks" [...] for him, [...] "I started crying. It just vibrated in my soul, and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to work with that sound." [...] While Merenstein had been to see Morrison, [...] Schwaid had set to work on resolving Morrison's contractual [...] troubles.|$|E

500|$|Although {{there had}} been stress and {{conflict}} during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the Mother's Milk sessions were uncomfortable due to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled {{that he and the}} band were at odds: [...] "Suffice to say that I had a very intense personal relationship [...] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [...]" [...] Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, [...] " [...] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." [...] Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude and ultimately resented his playing on the record, feeling it was too [...] "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, [...] "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something out of me that I wasn't feeling, and we got in a fight and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was done with him." ...|$|E
500|$|Rodriguez {{first came}} up with the idea for Planet Terror during the {{production}} of The Faculty: [...] "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [...] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, and then I got onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [...] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should've made my zombie film.'" [...] The story was reapproached when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for Grindhouse.|$|E
500|$|The artists co-wrote [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] {{with its}} {{producers}} Afrojack, Diplo, and Free School, with additional writing from Ryan Buendia. The song was recorded and mixed by Brian Springer at The Record Plant—a studio in Los Angeles, California. [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] was released for digital download on February 1, 2011, {{and was sent}} to rhythmic contemporary radio in the United States on February 8. In an interview with Vibe magazine, Diplo revealed {{that when he was}} first asked to put the song together, he thought that [...] "Look at Me Now" [...] was not for an official release, saying: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was working on something for a Chris Brown record, but I thought it was for a mixtape... When I did the beat, I gave it to one of his writers. Then Busta Rhymes got on it and I was like, 'Okay, {{this is going to be}} a club record.' And then when Wayne got on it 'Look at Me Now' became a radio record. It just took off from there." ...|$|E
