40|$|We {{present the}} {{telltale}} {{signature of the}} tidal capture and disruption of an object by a massive black hole in a galactic centre. As {{a result of the}} interaction with the black hole's strong gravitational field, the object's light curve can flare-up with characteristic time of the order of 100 sec Ã— (M_bh / 10 ^ 6 M_Solar). Our simulations show that general relativity plays {{a crucial role in the}} late stages of the encounter in two ways: (i) due to the precession of perihelion, tidal disruption is more severe, and (ii) light bending and aberration of light produce and enhance flares seen by a distant observer. We present our results for the case of a tidally disrupted Solar-type star. We also discuss the two strongest flares that have been observed at the Galactic centre. Although the first was observed in X-rays and the second in infra-red, they have almost identical light curves and we find it interesting that it is possible to fit the <b>infra-red</b> <b>flare</b> with a rather simple model of the tidally disrupted comet-like or planetary object. We discuss the model and possible scenarios how such an event can occur. Comment: 3 pages, 1 figur...|$|E
40|$|Compact binary mergers {{may have}} already been {{observed}} as they are the leading model for short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). Radioactive decay within the ejecta from these mergers is expected to produce an <b>infra-red</b> <b>flare,</b> dubbed macronova (or kilonova), on a time scale of a week. Recently two such macronova candidates were identified in followup observations of sGRBs, strengthening the possibility that those indeed arise from mergers. The same ejecta will also produce a long term (months to years) radio emission due to its interaction with the surrounding ISM. In search for this emission, we observed the two macronova candidates, GRB 130603 B and GRB 060614 with the Jansky very large array (VLA) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Our observations resulted in null-detections, putting strong upper limits on the kinetic energy and mass of the ejecta. A possible outcome of a merger is a highly magnetized neutron star (a magnetar), which has been suggested as the central engine for GRBs. Such a magnetar will deposit a significant fraction of its energy into the ejecta leading to a brighter radio flare. Our results, therefore, rule out magnetars in these two events.

5000|$|The trainer {{for both}} {{challenges}} was Craig [...] "Sawman" [...] Sawyer, Navy SEALs instructor and former sniper. The Browning Automatic Rifle (B.A.R.) {{was designed for}} advancing infantrymen to sling over the shoulder and fire from the hip, a technique called [...] "walking fire". The Milkor USA M32A1 MSGL can fire a variety of rounds like parachuting video camera, <b>infra-red</b> <b>flares,</b> and smoke or flash-bang rounds.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{countermeasures}} are smoke grenade dischargers. These help IFVs to avoid attacks from ATGMs {{by providing a}} smoke screen. Some vehicles, such as the French VBCI, employ <b>infra-red</b> jamming <b>flare</b> dispensers. These are effective against missiles with IR guidance systems.|$|R
40|$|The compact {{radio source}} Sgr A* at {{the centre of}} our Galaxy {{harbours}} a super-massive black hole, and is therefore the nearest laboratory for testing the super-massive black hole astrophysics and environment. Since {{it is not an}} active galactic nucleus, it also offers the possibility of observing the capture of low-mass objects, such as comets or asteroids, that may orbit the central black hole. In this paper we discuss conditions for tidal disruption of low-mass objects and predictions of the appearance and light curve of such events, as well as their relevance for the X-ray and <b>infra-red</b> <b>flares</b> detected in Sgr A*. The modelled light curves of such tidal disruption events bear marks of the strong gravitational field: tidal squeezing and elongation of the object, gravitational lensing, aberration of light, and Doppler effects. Finally, we show that this model is able to reproduce and fit X-ray flares...|$|R
50|$|Within minutes, the U.S., British and Afghan {{special forces}} seized and secured dozens of {{helicopter}} landing sites. Most notably U.S. Army Special Forces ODA 1231 along with Afghan Commandos from 3rd Commando Kandak {{took control of}} the southern tip of the city, being the first boots on the ground. At 2:25 am Chinooks approached, flown by pilots with night vision equipment and guided by <b>infra-red</b> <b>flares,</b> dropped from U.S. Marine KC-130's. At about 4 am, RAF Chinooks full of soldiers from the 1st battalion the Royal Welsh left Camp Bastion, the main British base in Helmand, for the Pegasus landing zone in the Taliban stronghold of Showal in the Chah-e-Anjir area. At the same time the British Manoeuvre Support Group consisting of the Viking Gp, Close Support Armoured Engineers (including the first deployment of Trojan Armoured vehicles) and Route opening capabilities departed for the Op Moshtarak AO. While the British force began to secure their area, a 1,000-strong combined force of members of the U.S. Marine Corps and the Afghan National Army landed in Marja. During the following 90 minutes, more Marines arrived in waves of CH-53 Super Stallion transport helicopters. By daybreak, hundreds more soldiers began to enter the area by land, using mobile bridges and Assault Breacher Vehicles.|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} that the Galactic centre emits flares at various wavelengths represents a puzzle concerning their origin, {{but at the}} same time it is a relevant opportunity to investigate the environment of the nearest super-massive black hole. In this paper we shall review some of our recent results concerning the tidal evolution of the orbits of low mass satellites around black holes, and the tidal effect during their in-fall. We show that tidal interaction can offer an explanation for transient phenomena like near <b>infra-red</b> and X-ray <b>flares</b> from Sgr A*.
