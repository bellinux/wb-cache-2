The most common topology for these is shunt anti-resonators coupled by series capacitors, less commonly, by inductors, {{or in the}} case of a two-section <b>filter,</b> <b>by</b> mutual inductance. These are most useful where the design requirement is not too stringent, that is, moderate bandwidth, roll-off and passband ripple.|$|E

5|$|Mayflies are {{involved}} in both primary production and bioturbation. A study in laboratory simulated streams revealed that the Centroptilum genus of the mayfly increased the export of periphyton, thus indirectly affecting primary production positively, which is an essential process for ecosystems. The mayfly can also reallocate and alter the nutrient availability in aquatic habitats {{through the process of}} bioturbation. By burrowing in the bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients, mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production. Once burrowing {{to the bottom of the}} lake, mayfly nymphs begin to billow their respiratory gills. This motion creates current that carries food particles through the burrow and allows the nymph to filter feed. Other mayfly nymphs possess elaborate filter feeding mechanisms like that of the genus Isonychia. The nymph have forelegs that contain long bristle-like structures that have two rows of hairs. Interlocking hairs form the <b>filter</b> <b>by</b> which the insect traps food particles. The action of filter feeding has a small impact on water purification but an even larger impact on the convergence of small particulate matter into matter of a more complex form that goes on to benefit consumers later in the food chain.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the performance of three models of drippers using treated sewage effluent, pure and diluted, and two types of filters, screen and disc. The treated sewage effluent used in the experiment was collected from the city’s treatment plant. The experiment included 12 lateral lines with three types of emitters to apply pure (100 %) and diluted (50 %) effluent <b>filtered</b> <b>by</b> screen and disc filters. The combination of those factors set the treatments: T 1 (50 % effluent diluted in fresh water <b>filtered</b> <b>by</b> a screen filter); T 2 (50 % effluent diluted in fresh water <b>filtered</b> <b>by</b> a disc filter); T 3 (pure effluent <b>filtered</b> <b>by</b> a screen filter); T 4 (pure effluent <b>filtered</b> <b>by</b> a disc <b>filter).</b> The results showed that the flat type emitter is less sensitive to clogging, the disc filter is the most suitable to prevent clogging and the use of pure or diluted sewage effluent increases the drippers’ flow rate coefficient of variation...|$|R

Appropriate filtering of these signals may drastically reduce the resulting THD. For instance, the pure square wave <b>filtered</b> <b>by</b> the Butterworth low-pass filter of the second-order (with the cutoff frequency set {{equal to the}} fundamental frequency) has THDF of 5.3%, while the same signal <b>filtered</b> <b>by</b> the fourth-order <b>filter</b> has THDF of 0.6%. However, analytic computation of the THDF for complicated waveforms and filters often represents a difficult task, and the resulting expressions may be quite laborious to obtain.

25|$|The {{first modern}} piped water system in Japan was {{completed}} in 1887 in the port city Yokohama, using surface water treated by a sand <b>filter.</b> <b>By</b> 1900, seven cities had piped water supply and by 1940 about {{one third of the}} population was connected to piped water systems. The incidence of water-borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery and typhoid remained high until after the Second World War when disinfection was introduced by the Americans and became mandatory in 1957. Through the increase of piped water supply, disinfection and sanitation the incidence of waterborne diseases dropped sharply during the 1960s and 70s.|$|E
25|$|Compared to filters {{that hang}} {{on the back of}} the aquarium, canister-style {{external}} filters offer a greater quantity of filter materials to be used along with a greater degree of flexibility with respect to filter material choice. Water enters the canister filled with the chosen filter material through an intake pipe at the bottom of the canister, passes through the material, and is fed back to the aquarium through the return pipe. Water is forced to circulate through the <b>filter</b> <b>by</b> a pump typically installed at the top of the canister. It is important to note that canister filters are sealed, fully flooded systems, meaning that the aquarium, intake pipe, filter interior and the return pipe form a continuous body of water. In this configuration both the intake and return path form two siphons, which precisely counterbalance each other. Under these circumstances, the filter pump does not have to spend any effort to lift the water back to the aquarium, regardless of how high the latter is installed above the canister. The pump should only be powerful enough to push the water through the filtering material as well as overcome the drag in the intake and return pipes. This makes canister filter pumps virtually insensitive to the height difference between the aquarium and the filter (although exceeding the manufacturer-specified height limit can lead to leaks).|$|E

500|$|Spectroscopy, as a measurement, is {{considerably}} {{more difficult than}} simple photometry, which measures the brightness of astronomical objects through certain filters. When photometric data {{is all that is}} available (for example, the Hubble Deep Field and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field), astronomers rely on a technique for measuring photometric redshifts. Due to the broad wavelength ranges in photometric filters and the necessary assumptions {{about the nature of the}} spectrum at the light-source, errors for these sorts of measurements can range up to , and are much less reliable than spectroscopic determinations. However, photometry does at least allow a qualitative characterization of a redshift. For example, if a Sun-like spectrum had a redshift of , it would be brightest in the infrared rather than at the yellow-green color associated with the peak of its blackbody spectrum, and the light intensity will be reduced in the <b>filter</b> <b>by</b> a factor of four, [...] Both the photon count rate and the photon energy are redshifted. (See K correction for more details on the photometric consequences of redshift.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The Bode {{equaliser}} can {{be converted}} into a constant resistance <b>filter</b> <b>by</b> using the entire Bode network as the Z branch of a Zobel network, resulting in a rather complex network of bridge T networks embedded in a larger bridge T.

[...] Note that the dual of a constant resistance bridge T network is the identical network. [...] The dual of a Bode network is therefore the same network except for the load resistance RL, which must be the inverse, RL', in the dual circuit. [...] To adjust the equaliser RL and RL' must be ganged, or otherwise kept in step such that as RL increases RL' will decrease and vice versa.|$|E
