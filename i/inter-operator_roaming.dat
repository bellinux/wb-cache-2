50|$|Since it is {{difficult}} for a single service provider to build an infrastructure that offers global access to its subscribers, roaming between service providers is encouraged by the Wi-Fi Alliance with the protocol WISPr, a set of recommendations approved by the alliance which facilitate inter-network and <b>inter-operator</b> <b>roaming</b> of Wi-Fi users. Modern wireless services have latency comparable to other terrestrial broadband networks.|$|E
40|$|In third {{generation}} multi-operator mobile telecommunication systems, terminal operations will allow users {{to select the}} desirable operator among the ones available, provided that the user access rights are maintained. In this paper, three alternative (<b>inter-operator)</b> <b>roaming</b> scenarios {{between public and private}} operators are proposed. The first scenario considers private operators as autonomous networks (GSM-based approach), the second scenario considers private operators as `domains' of a public operator (DECT-based approach), while the third one considers private operators as extensions of a public operator coverage. Their advantages and disadvantages are highlighted, while particular attention is paid on the implications on access rights management and design issues...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes and investigates a green {{virtualization}} {{framework for}} infrastructure sharing among multiple cellular operators whose networks are {{powered by a}} combination of conventional and renewable sources of energy. Under the proposed framework, the virtual network formed by unifying radio access infrastructures of all operators is optimized for minimum energy consumption by deactivating base stations (BSs) with low traffic loads. The users initially associated to those BSs are off-loaded to neighboring active ones. A fairness criterion for collaboration based on roaming prices is introduced to cover the additional energy costs incurred by host operators. The framework also ensures that any collaborating operator is not negatively affected by its participation in the proposed virtualization. A multi-objective linear programming problem is formulated to achieve energy and cost efficiency of the networks' operation by identifying the set of <b>inter-operator</b> <b>roaming</b> prices. For the case when collaboration among all operators is infeasible due to profitability, capacity, or power constraints, an iterative algorithm is proposed to determine the groups of operators that can viably collaborate. Results show significant energy savings using the proposed virtualization as compared to the standalone case. Moreover, collaborative operators exploiting locally generated renewable energy are rewarded more than traditional ones.
