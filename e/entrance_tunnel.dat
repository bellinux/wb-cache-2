5|$|David Winkler and Frederick Sheldon {{believe that}} {{evolutionary}} {{development in the}} mud-building swallows, and individual species follow this order of construction. A retort builder like red-rumped swallow starts with an open cup, closes it, and then builds the <b>entrance</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Winkler and Sheldon propose {{that the development of}} closed nests reduced competition between males for copulations with the females. Since mating occurs inside the nest, the difficulty of access means other males are excluded. This reduction in competition permits the dense breeding colonies typical of the Delichon martins.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{plans for}} {{expansion}} of Turf Moor were {{released to the}} public. The Burnley directors proposed a major development of the stadium, costing £20 million. The plans, which would incorporate the rebuilding of the Cricket Field Stand and the moving of the players' <b>entrance</b> <b>tunnel,</b> {{have been put on}} hold until the current financial climate improves. In 2009, following Burnley's promotion to the Premier League, the development of a second tier on the Bob Lord stand was announced. Director Paul Fletcher stated that the anticipated capacity of Turf Moor would eventually be 28,000 to cope with extra fans. However following the club's relegation from the Premier League in 2010, these plans were put on hold indefinitely.|$|E

25|$|The Diamond Ohio logo, {{which is}} created by {{superimposing}} the I over {{the center of the}} H, and making the O's into pointed triangles, was first created by the OSUMB in the late 1930s.

Photographs show OSUMB director Manley Whitcomb (1939-1942, 1946-1951) charting this formation on a table lined with field markings, and other photographs depict the band in performance of the Diamond Ohio as far back as 1939.|$|E
25|$|In 1954 she {{was moved}} to a {{custom-built}} dry dock at Greenwich. She was stripped of upper masts, yards, deck-houses and ballast to lighten her before being towed from the East India Import Dock to the special dry dock at Greenwich. The skipper on this occasion was 83-year-old Captain C.E. Irving, who had sailed the world three times in her before he was 17. The river pilot was Ernest Coe. Thereafter the <b>entrance</b> <b>tunnel</b> to the dry dock was filled in, the river wall rebuilt {{and the work of}} re-rigging began. The foundation stone of the dry dock was laid by The Duke of Edinburgh, patron of the Cutty Sark Preservation Society, in June 1953.

25|$|The {{match between}} Liverpool and Nottingham Forest began as {{scheduled}} at 3:00pm. Fans were still streaming into pens 3 and 4 {{from the rear}} <b>entrance</b> <b>tunnel</b> as the match began. For some time, problems {{at the front of}} the Liverpool central goal pens went largely unnoticed except by those inside it, and by a few police at that end of the pitch. Liverpool's goalkeeper, Bruce Grobbelaar, reported fans from behind him pleading to him for help as the situation worsened. The police at first attempted to stop fans from spilling out of the pens, some believing this to be a pitch invasion. At approximately 3:05pm in match action, Peter Beardsley kicked a shot which struck Nottingham Forest's goal bar. Possibly connected to the excitement, a surge in pen 3 caused one of its metal crush barriers to give way, thrusting people forward on top of one another, and into the pen's front fences.|$|E

40|$|Background: At the <b>entrance</b> of a <b>tunnel,</b> {{reflection}} of sunlight {{from the surrounding}} environment {{and a lack of}} adequate lighting usually cause some vision problems. The {{purpose of this study was}} to perform a safety evaluation of lighting on a very long road in Ilam, Iran. Methods: The average luminance was measured using a luminance meter (model S 3; Hagner, Solna, Sweden). A camera (model 108, 35 -mm single-lens reflex; Yashica, Nagano, Japan) was used to take photographs of the safe stopping distance from the <b>tunnel</b> <b>entrance.</b> Equivalent luminance was determined according to the Holliday polar diagram. Results: Considering the average luminance at the <b>tunnel</b> <b>entrance</b> (116. 7 cd/m 2) and using Adrian's equation, the safe level of lighting at the <b>entrance</b> of the <b>tunnel</b> was determined to be 0. 7. Conclusion: A comparison between the results of the safe levels of lighting at the <b>entrance</b> of the <b>tunnel</b> and the De Boer scale showed that the phenomenon of black holes is created at the <b>tunnel</b> <b>entrance.</b> This may lead to a misadaptation of the drivers’ eyes to the change in luminance level at the <b>entrance</b> of the <b>tunnel,</b> thereby increasing the risk of road accidents in this zone...|$|R

The suggested taxonomic sequence of the mud-building swallows has been recommended by at least two European taxonomic committees.|$|E

Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow, the DNA research showed that if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off.|$|E
500|$|Also, bird nest. Specialized types: burrow; cavity; cup (adherent [...] cup; statant cup); dome; dormitory; eyries (or aeries); hanging; ledge; mound; pendant; platform; roost (or winter-nest); scrape; saucer or plate; and sphere. The spot {{in which}} a bird lays and incubates its eggs and raises its young. Although the term popularly refers to a {{specific}} structure made by the bird itself—such as the grassy cup nest of the American robin or Eurasian blackbird, or the elaborately woven hanging nest of the Montezuma oropendola or the village weaver—for some species, a nest is simply a shallow depression made in sand; for others, it is the knot-hole left by a broken branch, a burrow dug into the ground, a chamber drilled into a tree, an enormous rotting pile of vegetation and earth, a shelf made of dried saliva or a mud dome with an <b>entrance</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The smallest bird nests are those of some hummingbirds, tiny cups {{which can be a}} mere [...] across and [...] high. At the other extreme, some nest mounds built by the dusky scrubfowl measure more than [...] in diameter and stand nearly [...] tall. Not all bird species build nests. Some species lay their eggs directly on the ground or rocky ledges, while brood parasites lay theirs in the nests of other birds, letting unwitting [...] "foster parents" [...] do all the work of rearing the young. Although nests are primarily used for breeding, they may also be reused in the non-breeding season for roosting and some species build special dormitory nests or roost nests (or winter-nest) that are used only for roosting. Most birds build a new nest each year, though some refurbish their old nests. The large eyries (or aeries) of some eagles are platform nests that have been used and refurbished for several years. In most species, the female does most or all of the nest construction, though the male often helps. In some polygynous species, however, the male does most or all of the nest building. The nest may also form a part of the courtship display such as in weaver birds. The ability to choose and maintain good nest sites and build high quality nests may be selected for by females in these species. In some species the young from previous broods may also act as helpers for the adults.|$|E
