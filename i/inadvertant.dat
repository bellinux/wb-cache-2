40|$|Inherent to {{the design}} and {{construction}} of electroexplosive devices is a vulnerability to inadvertent initiation from electrostatic discharges. The small spacing (approx. 1 mm) between the bridgewire circuits and the body and between bridgewire circuits afford easy breakdown paths for electrostatic voltages. In some cases where metallic component pyrotechnic materials are loaded onto the bridgewire circuits the susceptability to <b>inadvertant</b> initiation is increased.

Certain formulations of metal oxides normally have electrically nonconductive characteristics. However, at selective potentials they become conductive. By proper design and incorporation into electroexplosive devices a variety of breakdown potentials can be achieved. The breakdown potential of the varistor element can be adjusted to meet the requirements of the particular electroexplosive device. The varistor element can also be incorporated in an area isolated from the explosive or pyrotechnic material.

This paper {{explores the}} idea of exposing {{sections}} of the private key in public-key cryptosystems whose security {{is based on the}} intractability of factorising large integers, such as RSA. While substantial work has been done in the area of partial key exposure, the aim has been to investigate the implications of <b>inadvertant</b> partial exposure of the private key. We focus instead on the potential advantages of deliberately revealing portions of the private key, and so, term our scheme “partial hiding”. Significant segments of the key are made publicly available, greatly reducing the amount of data which must be securely hidden.

Interfacial reactions represent one way to trigger the intrinsic thermodynamic instability. Both Li(2) CO(3) and LEDC are predicted to exhibit exothermic reactions on lithium metal surfaces, and the barriers are sufficiently low to permit reactions on battery operation time scales.

In an outbreak, {{people of all ages}} will be vaccinated. To prepare for the impact of large-scale ring and mass vaccinations, we conducted a systematic review of the complication and mortality risks of smallpox vaccination. We summarized these risks for post-vaccinial encephalitis, vaccinia necrosum (progressive vaccinia), eczema vaccinatum, generalized vaccinia, and accidental infection (<b>inadvertant</b> autoinoculation). Methods Using a MEDLINE search strategy, we identified 348 articles, of which seven studies met our inclusion criteria (the number of primary vaccinations and re-vaccinations were reported, sufficient data were provided to calculate complication or case-fatality risks, and comparable case definitions were used). For each complication, we estimated of the complication, death, and case-fatality risks. Results The life-threatening complications of post-vaccinial encephalitis and vaccinia necrosum were at least 3 and 1 per million primary vaccinations, respectively. Twenty-nine percent of vaccinees with post-vaccinial encephalitis died and 15 % with vaccinia necrosum died. There were no deaths among vaccinees that developed eczema vaccinatum; however, 2. 3 % of non-vaccinated contacts with eczema vaccinatum died. Among re-vaccinees, the risk of post-vaccinial encephalitis was reduced 26 -fold, the risk of generalized vaccinia was reduced 29 -fold, and the risk of eczema vaccinatum was reduced 12 -fold.

An extensive comparison of both breakpoints and their germ line counterparts indicated that an <b>inadvertant</b> recombinase-mediated break at chromosome segment 11 p 15 recombined with the delta T-cell receptor at 14 q 11. The derivative 11 breakpoint resembles a coding joint in which 11 p 15 rather than a variable region was introduced 5 ' to a D delta 1 D delta 2 J delta 1 intermediate rearrangement. Conversely, the derivative 14 breakpoint corresponds to a signal joint between the 5 ' heptamer-spacer-nonamer recombinational signal of D delta 1 and an isolated heptamer at 11 p 15. Multiple, apparently distinct transcripts were found flanking both breakpoints of 8402. RNAs of 3. 5, 4. 4, 1. 4, and 8. 0 kilobases originating from either side of the derivative 14 breakpoint were highly expressed in 8402 compared with other cells. This suggests that this translocation deregulated multiple genes and provides the opportunity to assess any multifactorial contribution they may have to malignancy. We cloned and sequenced several cDNAs representing the 1. 4 -kilobase transcript (termed Ttg- 1 [T-cell translocation gene 1]) from an 8402 library.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{pituitary}} growth hormone displays an episodic pattern of evolution, with a slow underlying evolutionary rate and occasional sustained bursts of rapid change. The present study establishes that pituitary prolactin shows a similar pattern. During much of tetrapod evolution the sequence of prolactin has been strongly conserved, showing a slow basal rate of change (approx 0. 27 × 109 substitutions/amino acid site/year). This rate has increased substantially (∼ 12 - to 38 -fold) on at least four occasions during eutherian evolution, during the evolution of primates, artiodactyls, rodents, and elephants. That these increases are real and not a consequence of <b>inadvertant</b> comparison of paralogous genes is shown (for at least the first three groups) {{by the fact that they}} are confined to mature protein coding sequence and not apparent in sequences coding for signal peptides or when synonymous substitutions are examined. Sequences of teleost prolactins differ markedly from those of tetrapods and lungfish, but during the course of teleost evolution the rate of change of prolactin has been less variable than that of growth hormone. It is concluded that the evolutionary pattern seen for prolactin shows long periods of near-stasis interrupted by occasional bursts of rapid change, resembling the pattern seen for growth hormone in general but not in detail. The most likely basis for these bursts appears to be adaptive evolution though the biological changes involved are relatively small...|$|E

It was not known previously whether these regulatory changes are caused by a single activation event or whether they occur independently from one another, providing a multilayered control that may prevent <b>inadvertant</b> activation of hHSF 1. Comparison of wild-type and mutant hHSF 1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes and human HeLa cells suggested that retention of hHSF 1 in the monomeric form depends on hydrophobic repeats (LZ 1 to LZ 3) and a carboxy-terminal sequence element in hHSF 1 {{as well as on}} the presence of a titratable factor in the cell. Oligomerization of hHSF 1 appears to induce DNA-binding activity as well as to uncover an amino-terminally located nuclear localization signal. A mechanism distinct from that controlling oligomerization regulates the transcriptional competence of hHSF 1. Components of this mechanism were mapped to a region, including LZ 2 and nearby sequences downstream from LZ 2, that is clearly separated from the carboxy-terminally located transcription activation domain(s). We propose the existence of a fold-back structure that masks the transcription activation domain in the unstressed cell but is opened up by modification of hHSF 1 and/or binding of a factor facilitating hHSF 1 unfolding in the stressed cell.

The tools for such a risk analysis are calculation models to simulate conceivable accidents {{with the release of}} cryogenic liquids as realistic as possible. The spreading and vaporization of cryogenic liquids, as a part of it, has been investigated in this work. Experiments have been conducted to study the vaporization of liquid nitrogen (LN_ 2) over insulated bodies of macadam and concrete (dry/moist). For moist concrete, the time until a complete vaporization of the LN_ 2 is significantly smaller than for dry concrete. Also, the radial pool spreading and vaporization of liquid nitrogen over water and of liquid hydrogen over water and aluminium has been experimentally examined. After spreading of the cryogenic liquid over a water surface, ice formation has been observed. To simulate vaporization over insulated bodies as well as pool spreading over water and solid grounds, the computer model LAuV (LachenAusbreitung und Verdampfung) has been developed. The results of postcalculations are in good agreement with the measurement data of the above mentioned own experiments as well as of literature data. Postcalculations have been made for liquid natural gas, liquid nitrogen, and liquid hydrogen.

40|$|No {{previous}} controlled {{studies of}} ovarian germ cell tumours have been reported; however the tumour {{is similar to}} germ cell testicular cancer in terms of histology, age-specific incidence rates (i. e. highest rates in young adulthood), and secular trends of increasing incidence. The investigation was designed to determine if maternal hormonal factors which {{have been found to}} increase the risk of testis cancer in male offspring are also risk factors for the ovarian tumour. The analysis is based on 73 cases diagnosed before age 35 and 138 age-race matched controls. The cases were identified by tumour registries in Los Angeles (1972 - 84) and Seattle (1974 - 84) and controls were selected from friends and/or neighbourhood residents. Interviews were conducted on the telephone with mothers of cases and controls. The primary finding was that mother's use of exogenous hormones (including the hormonal pregnancy test, DES or other supportive hormones, and <b>inadvertant</b> use of oral contraceptives after conception) increased risk (Odds ratio, OR = 3. 60, 95 % CL = 1. 2 - 13. 1). Other maternal factors associated with elevated risk were high pre-pregnancy body mass (OR = 2. 7, 95 % CL = 1. 0 - 7. 6), more rapid achievement of regular menstruation after menarche (OR = 1. 8, 95 % CL = 0. 9 - 3. 8), and age at index pregnancy under 20 (OR = 2. 8, 95 % CL = 1. 0 - 10. 7). In conclusion, these results support findings from testis cancer studies regarding a hormonal aetiology for germ cell tumours, and a mechanism by which oestrogen may affect the germ cells is proposed...|$|E
