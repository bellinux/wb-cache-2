40|$|The {{current study}} assesses {{perception}} of interaural time differences (ITD) in bimodal listeners, i. e. users of a cochlear implant (CI) and {{a hearing aid}} (HA) on the other side, with vowel stimuli. In previous studies we found that bimodal listeners are sensitive to ITD in modulated single- and multiple-channel stimuli, but did not show sensitivity to ITD in unmodulated low-frequency stimuli, emphasizing the importance of envelope cues for ITD detection in bimodal stimulation. Sensitivity to ITD depends on properties of the signal envelope such as modulation depth, onset steepness and duty cycle (Ewert et al, 2010, Laback et al, 2009). With current clinical CI speech processors ITD cues present in the acoustic signal are not always clearly transmitted in the <b>electric</b> <b>signal.</b> Due to <b>channel</b> saturation and channel selection criteria modulation depth is not always preserved and often modulations are not synchronized across channels. With the aim to improve ITD sensitivity in bimodal listeners, a CI processing strategy was developed which introduces modulations in the <b>electric</b> <b>signal</b> synchronized across <b>channels</b> and synchronized across the ears. ITD perception performance of bimodal listeners was determined for a vowel processed with a current clinical standard CI processing strategy (ACE) and with the newly developed strategy. Results show significantly higher ITD perception performance with the new strategy compared to ACE. Two listeners were not sensitive to ITD in the ACE signal at all. With the new strategy all listeners showed sensitivity and for {{four out of five}} listeners just noticeable differences in ITD in the order of 100 - 250 us were found. These results suggest that for ITD perception, bimodal listeners would benefit from a speech processing strategy introducing modulations in the <b>electric</b> <b>signal</b> synchronized across <b>channel</b> and synchronized across the ears. Better perception of ITD cues can lead to improved localization abilities and speech understanding in noise. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|ATIC (Advanced Thin Ionization Calorimeter) is {{a balloon}} borne {{experiment}} {{designed to measure}} the cosmic ray composition for elements from hydrogen to iron and their energy spectra from approx. 50 GeV to near 100 TeV. It consists of a Si-matrix detector to determine the charge of a CRT particle, a scintillator hodoscope for tracking, carbon interaction targets and a fully active BGO calorimeter. ATIC had its first flight from McMurdo, Antarctica from 28 / 12 / 2000 to 13 / 01 / 2001. The ATIC flight collected approximately 25 million events. The silicon matrix of the ATIC spectrometer is designed to resolve individual elements from proton to iron. To provide this resolution careful calibration of each pixel of the silicon matrix is required. Firstly, for each electronic channel of the matrix the pedestal value was subtracted taking into account its drift during the flight. The muon calibration made before the flight was used then to convert <b>electric</b> <b>signals</b> (in ADC <b>channel</b> number) to energy deposits in each pixel. However, the preflight muon calibration was not accurate enough for the purpose, {{because of lack of}} statistics in each pixel. To improve charge resolution the correction was done for the position of Helium peak in each pixel during the flight. The other way to set <b>electric</b> <b>signals</b> in electronics <b>channels</b> of the Si-matrix to one scale was correction for electric channel gains accurately measured in laboratory. In these measurements it was found that small different nonlinearities for different channels are present in the region of charge Z > 20. The correction for these non-linearities was not done yet. In linear approximation the method provides practically the same resolution as muon calibration plus He-peak correction. For searching a pixel with the signal of primary particle an indication from the cascade in the calorimeter was used. For this purpose a trajectory was reconstructed using weight centers of energy deposits in BGO layers. The point of intersection of this trajectory with Si-matrix and its RMS was determined. The pixel with maximal signal in 3 sigma region was taken as sought. The signal in this pixel was corrected by trajectory zenith angle. The preliminary results on charge resolution of the Si-matrix in the range from protons to iron are presented...|$|R

In diabetic patients, impaired wound healing {{is one of}} the most challenging complications in diabetes management. A fundamental gap in knowledge is whether diabetic wounds have abnormal <b>electric</b> <b>signaling.</b> Here we used a vibrating probe to demonstrate that diabetic corneas produced significantly weaker wound <b>electric</b> <b>signals</b> than the normal cornea. This was confirmed in three independent animal models of diabetes: db/db, streptozotocin-induced and mice fed a high-fat diet. Spatial measurements illustrated that diabetic cornea wound currents at the wound edge but not wound center were significantly weaker than normal. Time lapse measurements revealed that the electric currents at diabetic corneas lost the normal rising and plateau phases. The abnormal <b>electric</b> <b>signals</b> correlated significantly with impaired wound healing. Immunostaining suggested lower expression of chloride channel 2 and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator in diabetic corneal epithelium. Acute high glucose exposure significantly (albeit moderately) reduced electrotaxis of human corneal epithelial cells in vitro, but did not affect the electric currents at cornea wounds.

Preseismic <b>electric</b> <b>signals</b> of the total piezoelectric field, its first time derivative, its oscillation due to M 1 and K 1 tidal components have been observed by single monitoring sites during the actual 1999 to 2012 experiment in Greece. Moreover, the "strange attractor like" <b>electric</b> preseismic <b>signal</b> was detected by the simultaneously use of two distant monitoring sites.
