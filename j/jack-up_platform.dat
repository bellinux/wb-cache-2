40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{problem of}} damage {{estimation}} due to fatigue in ageing <b>jack-up</b> <b>platforms</b> is considered, using theories of random processes. The sea-wave excitations are modeled as stationary, Gaussian random processes, with specified {{power spectral density}} function. The well known Morison’s equation {{is used to calculate}} the load acting on the structure due to sea-waves. Thus, the force is a non-Gaussian process, whose probability density function (pdf) is not known. Analytical expressions are developed to approximate the pdf of the load. The probabilistic characteristics of the structure response are obtained from a random vibration analysis. The simple peak counting method is adopted for estimating the mean fatigue damage. This requires knowledge of the joint pdf of the peaks for the structure response and their first and second time derivatives, at the same time instant. An analytical formulation is developed to approximate this joint pdf. However, closed form approximations may not always be possible. Instead, we demonstrate the use of a recently developed computational algorithm to approximate the peak distributions. The proposed formulation provides an alternative and computationally cheaper technique for estimating the fatigue damage in comparison to the time consuming Monte Carlo simulations. The results are of use in predicting the remaining lifetime of ageing <b>jack-up</b> <b>platforms...</b>|$|R

40|$|Jack-up {{platforms}} are off-shore structure {{which are}} more often placed in deeper water and harsher weather conditions. The consequence is that the natural frequency of the platform coincides with the wave frequency and starts to resonate in its natural frequency. The problem becomes more complicated, {{due to the fact}} that the natural frequency of the platform is not constant and varies in time due to structural properties, variable deck loading and environmental conditions. These vibrations are undesired and have to be damped. The aim of this thesis is to design an experimental model for a damping system on a jack up platform, which can optimally damp the motion of the primary structure when it is excited in the time varying natural frequency. This problem is tackled by comparing passive, semi-active and active Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) systems, regarding feasibility and robustness for installation on a <b>jack-up</b> <b>platform.</b> Hereafter the optimal tuning frequency and damping ratio are obtained by studying the work of Tsai and Lin, Connor and Den Hartog. These tuning laws are then combined with a Self-Tuning Regulator (STR), which makes it possible to continuously tune the semi-active damping system to its optimal parameters by estimating the unknown structural parameter using a Recursive Least Square Estimator. The designed experimental model is a two degree of freedom model and incorporates crucial characteristics such as mass distribution, damping ratio and natural frequency. The semi-active TMD system is able to adapt its stiffness and damping coefficient, such that is it always optimally tuned when the structural parameters of the experimental model changes. This thesis concludes that a semi-active TMD system is the most appropriate type of damping system for a <b>jack-up</b> <b>platform,</b> regarding feasibility and robustness.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the applications of plastic limit analysis to offshore foundations and anchors, including the drag embedment anchors (DEAs) for mobile offshore drilling units (MODU?s) and spudcan foundations for <b>jack-up</b> <b>platforms.</b> In deep waters, drag embedment anchors are an attractive option for mooring of semisubmersible platforms due to low installation cost and high holding capacity; {{on the other}} hand, <b>jack-up</b> <b>platforms</b> are more stable than semisubmersible platforms but only can be placed in shallow waters. The analyses of anchor capacities are developed for an idealized anchor comprising a rectangular fluke, a cylindrical shank, and a metal chain connected to the shank at the padeye. The anchor trajectory prediction during drag embedment is also developed by considering anchor behavior {{in conjunction with the}} mechanics of the anchor line. The results of simulations show that anchors approach at equilibrium condition rapidly during the embedment and both the normalized holding capacity and the anchor line uplift angle remain constants in this stage. Besides the geometry of the fluke, the properties of the shank and soil are also crucial factors in the anchor-soil interaction behavior. Partial failure of mooring systems for floating structures will subject drag anchors to loads having an appreciable component outside of the intended plane of loading. Partial failure of mooring systems during hurricanes in recent years have generated an interest in understanding drag anchor performance under these conditions. The analysis {{presents the}} simulations of three dimensional trajectories of an anchor system subjected to an out-of-plane load component. For the conditions simulated in the example analyses, the anchor experienced a modest amount of continued embedment following partial failure of the mooring system; however, the ultimate embedment and capacity of the anchor is much less than what would have developed if the anchor had continued in its original trajectory within the plane of intended loading. The analyses of the spudcan foundation of jack-up units include preloading, bearing capacity, and the displacement assessment. When the contribution of the soil moment resistance is considered, a three-stage assessment procedure is recommended: superposing environmental forces on the plot of yield surface, determining the value of yield function corresponding to the external forces, and computing the factor of safety of the spudcan.

40|$|There is a {{steadily}} increasing {{demand for the}} use of jack-up units in deeper water and harsher environments. To be confident of their use in these environments {{there is a need for}} jack-up analysis techniques to reflect accurately the physical processes occurring. The common modelling of spudcan footings as pinned or as linear springs is an over-simplification of foundation behaviour, and can therefore lead to over-conservative design. This paper details the implementation of a work hardening plasticity model for spudcan footings on dense sand (named Model C) into a dynamic structural analysis program (named JAKUP). The motivation for this is to have a balanced approach to the analysis of jack-up units, with the non-linearities in the structural, foundation and wave loading models all taken into account. Wave loading is considered using NewWave theory, and the importance of random wave histories shown by constraining the deterministic NewWave into a completely random surface elevation.

40|$|In this Master's thesis the sea lift {{operation}} from {{a supply}} vessel onto a oil platform has been evaluated. Two {{models have been}} built and analysed with different input parameters, as well {{as compared with the}} current load charts based on the calculation procedure found in the standard EN 13852 - 1. The most critical part of the sea lift operation with regards to the structural safety of the crane is the lift-off from the supply vessel deck. The snap-load in the lift wire will depend on the motions of the lifted object, which is following the supply vessel deck motions. For floating platforms the motions of the crane tip must be accounted, and hence the coupled system of the supply vessel and the platform must be evaluated to estimate the extremal snap-loads in the lifting wire. The two simulation models have been developed in the simulation program SIMA, which is a state of the art simulation program developed especially for simulation of marine operations. The first model is built to represent a fixed platform, and is hence a general model representing bottom-supported and <b>jack-up</b> <b>platforms.</b> The second model is modelled as a semi-submersible platform, representing the Kristin platform located at Haltenbanken in the North-Sea. The wave statistics for Haltenbanken have been analysed to find the most common significant wave heights, spectral peak periods and wave headings for the area over time. The extremal snap-loads are found by fitting a Gumbel distribution to the respective simulation results sample. It is found that the probability level of exceedance for the dynamic factors given by EN- 13852 are deviating between the models. For the different significant wave heights for the fixed platform, the EN 13852 - 1 represents a probability of exceedance of 0. 999 when the container is placed in the stern end of the supply vessel deck. For the floating platform the same probability of exceedance are roughly 10 % below the standard, and is hence much more conservative.|$|R

40|$|For {{dynamically}} sensitive structures or marine structure sujected {{to large}} displacements (such as jack-up paltform) the extreme response is often determined {{on the basis}} of short term time domain simulation of extreme sea states using environmental contour line method. A challenge with time-domain simulation is the representation of the sea spectrum. For first order wave (Gaussian seas), there is no big obstacle to performs a complete 3 -hour simulation. However, the computational requirements becomes prohibitive for second order irregular waves. The purpose of this report is to observe the effect of second order irregular waves on <b>jack-up</b> <b>platform</b> and also contribute to developement and verification of strategies on decreasing the computational time for time domain analysis. This report mainly consists of seven parts.

In addition, some strategies for reducing computational time also presented. The second part consists of explanation about the numerical. In the third part, a verification study is performed. The second order model is compared with theoretical wave distribution and 5 th Stokes wave. At the end of third part, the static analysis of second order irregular seas on single vertical cylinder with small diameter is performed. The four part deals with strategies to reduce time for calculating time for second order wave while the fourth part contains the metocean analysis.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{structural}} health monitoring (SHM), it is beneficial to develop a robust and accurate numerical strategy so as to identify key parameters of offshore structures. In this regard, {{it is difficult to}} use time-domain methods as the time history of wave load is not available unless output-only methods can be developed. Alternatively, spectral analysis widely used in offshore engineering to predict structural responses due to random wave conditions can be used. Thus the power spectral density (PSD) of structural response may be more appropriate than time history of structural responses in defining the objective (fitness) function for system identification of offshore structures. By minimizing PSD differences between measurements and simulations, the proposed numerical strategy is completely carried out in frequency domain, which can avoid inherent problems rising from random phase angles and unknown initial conditions in time domain.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{performance}} of floating buoys of a wave power generating <b>jack-up</b> <b>platform</b> called Haiyuan 1, in order to work out the optimum designed draft and hydraulic pressure. The performance of the buoy, especially its delivered power, is an important issue in designing oscillating buoy wave energy converter. In this case, major factors affect the performance including incident wave, designed draft, and hydraulic pressure on the buoy. To find out the relationship among design draft, hydraulic pressure, and delivered power, the key point is to precisely estimate wave induced motion of the buoy. Three-dimensional theory and time domain method based on potential theory were adopted in the paper. Unlike ship and other floating structures, motion of wave energy converter (WEC) buoy in wave will be weakened because of energy take-off, which will cause significant draft changing with time. Thus, draft changing should be taken into consideration as well. In addition, green water problem occurs more frequently than that in ship and other floating structures and also might the reduce delivered power. Therefore, green water problem will also be taken into account when choosing the optimum designed draft and hydraulic pressure. The calculation indicates that the optimum designed draft is 0. 935 m, while the optimum designed hydraulic pressure is 30 kN...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that work-hardening plasticity theory provides a suitable framework for interpreting and predicting the load-displacement behaviour of rigid shallow foundations under combined vertical, moment and horizontal loading. Most previous work has, however, been restricted to footings on granular soils. This paper describes a series of laboratory tests conducted at unit gravity using a small circular footing and specimens of reconstituted kaolin. The results indicate that work-hardening plasticity concepts can also be applied to the modelling of shallow foundation behaviour on undrained clay. The footing shape chosen for the experiments is representative of the 'spudcan' foundations which support the legs of <b>jack-up</b> drilling <b>platforms.</b> A novel testing apparatus allows independent control of the vertical, rotational and horizontal footing displacements within a single vertical plane. Tests conducted at constant vertical penetration are used to investigate the shape and size of the combined load yield surface at embedments ranging from 0 to 1 · 6 footing diameters. Tests under vertical load control provide further information about the yield surface, and are used to assess the suitability of an associated flow rule for predicting plastic footing displacements. The yield surface shape determined experimentally is compared with that implied by the general bearing capacity formula of Brinch Hansen, and some significant discrepancies are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|A hazard during {{installation}} of jack-up spudcans is punch-through, which {{is characterized by}} a peak resistance, followed by a significant reduction in spudcan resistance. This might lead to an uncontrolled rapid leg penetration as the installation generally is load-controlled. The problem is typical for sites where a stiff soil layer is overlying a soft clay layer. Accurate calculation of the expected displacement-resistance curve for these soil conditions is therefore important {{in order to reduce the}} risk of uncontrolled punch-through conditions. Numerical simulation of spud-can penetration into seabed during {{installation of}} <b>jack-up</b> <b>platforms</b> is a complex problem involving both large strains and large displacements where the geometry changes during penetration e. g. interface between layers. The Coupled-Eulerian-Lagrangion (CEL) method available in the finite element program package ABAQUS is suitable for this type of problem. The main aim of this Master Thesis is therefore to use the CEL method to analyse some published examples of spudcan penetration. Some preliminary tests were performed in Abaqus/Explicit, namely triaxial, oedometer and T-bar tests. It was revealed that the element size had a large impact on the results, where smaller elements increased the accuracy in general. The compression/penetration rate affected mainly the oscillations that occurred in the results. However, the resistance oscillated around an apparently correct mean value, and it was therefore possible to filter out some of the oscillations. Two spudcan penetration cases were chosen for calculation. The cases were found in Sindhu Tjahyono?s doctor thesis (Tjahyono, 2011). Comparison with Tjahyono?s results showed that smaller elements reduce the resistance, while larger elements increase the resistance. This behaviour was also found by the preliminary simulation. The cases with strain-softening were sensitive to mesh size, as the strain-softening were mostly localized in the shear bands, and the thickness to the shear bands were governed by the element size. Consequently can non-conservative result regarding punch-through be obtained if the elements are too small, as the soil behavior becomes more similar to a case where the soil has been fully remolded. Theoretical hand calculations for spudcan penetration were also investigated. SNAME?s guideline proposed in 2002 for two-layered clay was overly conservative. Hossain & Randolph?s method calculated the resistance more accurate, and gave a better description of the soil mechanisms, e. g. cavity depth. The method proposed by Tjahyono gave the closest estimate compared to the FEM calculations. The CEL method in Abaqus/Explicit has proven to be suitable for spudcan penetration problems. The penetration speed affected mainly how much oscillation that occurs in the results. The oscillation may be filtered out as the resistance oscillated around a mean value. The computational cost for these types of problems are large, and it is therefore of interest to find the highest penetration rate for which oscillations may be filtered out. However, there were some difficulties regarding the effects from the element size, especially when trying to include strain-softening behavior. It is important to address this problem, as non-conservative results might be obtained. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the {{worldwide}} historical structural failure data in the 1990 s on offshore structures, and compare this with the present risk analyses of Norwegian offshore structures. The paper describes an overview of registered accidents to offshore structures based on the databases WOAD and CODAM. The accident data is given for fixed <b>platforms,</b> <b>jack-ups</b> and for floating platforms. Estimates of risk level in annual frequencies and PLL values are given for each platform type. The paper concludes that: · The risk connected to marine operations and structures give a significant contribution to the total risk. · The historical risk to marine operations and structures is significant higher than the results from risk analyses. · Neither component nor system based reliability analyses of structures give adequate descriptions of the real risk connected to structures. · Human errors are probably the dominating cause of accidents connected to structural failure...|$|R
