Biomolecules synthesized by organisms will retain some of the D/H signature of the water which they were grown on, plus a large <b>fractionation</b> <b>factor</b> which can be as great as several hundred per mil.

25|$|Almost all of {{the organic}} {{hydrogen}} is exchangeable to some extent. Isotopic exchange of organic hydrogen will reorder the distribution of deuterium and often incorporate external hydrogen. Generally, more mature materials are more substantially exchanged. With effective exchange, aliphatic hydrogen can finally reach isotopic equilibrium at the final stage. Equilibrium <b>fractionation</b> <b>factor</b> varies among different hydrogen sites. For example, aliphatic hydrogen isotope fractionation depends on the carbon atom that the hydrogen atom bonds with. To the first order, alkyl hydrogen isotope composition follows this trend: δDPrimary carbon < δDSecondary carbon < δDTertiary carbon. The fractionation factors between carbon sites also decrease with increasing temperature. This can be potentially used as a thermo-history indicator. The fractionation between whole molecule and water can be estimated by averaging all hydrogen-positions, and {{this leads to a}} relatively small variation of equilibrium fractionation between different groups of hydrocarbons and water. A theoretical prediction estimated this to be -80‰ to -95‰ for steranes, -90‰ to -95‰ for hopanes, and -70‰ to -95‰ for typical cycloparaffins between 0°C to 100°C. At the temperature of the oil window and gas window, the equilibrium fractionation between different group of organic molecules is relatively small, as compared with large primary signals.|$|E

500|$|Calcium isotope {{fractionation}} during mineral formation {{has led to}} several applications of calcium isotopes. In particular, the 1997 observation by Skulan and DePaolo that calcium minerals are isotopically lighter than the solutions from which the minerals precipitate {{is the basis of}} analogous applications in medicine and in paleooceanography. In animals with skeletons mineralized with calcium, the calcium isotopic composition of soft tissues reflects the relative rate of formation and dissolution of skeletal mineral. In humans, changes in the calcium isotopic composition of urine {{have been shown to be}} related to changes in bone mineral balance. When the rate of bone formation exceeds the rate of bone resorption, the 44Ca/40Ca ratio in soft tissue rises and vice versa. Because of this relationship, calcium isotopic measurements of urine or blood may be useful in the early detection of metabolic bone diseases like osteoporosis. A similar system exists in seawater, where 44Ca/40Ca tends to rise when the rate of removal of Ca2+ by mineral precipitation exceeds the input of new calcium into the ocean. In 1997 Skulan and DePaolo presented the first evidence of change in seawater 44Ca/40Ca over geologic time, along with a theoretical explanation of these changes. More recent papers have confirmed this observation, demonstrating that seawater Ca2+ concentration is not constant, and that the ocean is never in a [...] "steady state" [...] with respect to calcium input and output.

Microbial mat and/or sediments were amended with site water only or with site water and various substrates and incubated in N 2 (g) flushed serum vials. It was hypothesized that trimethylamine (TMA) would be a dominant substrate in all ponds. Additionally, samples were incubated with substrates also reported to be of importance in hypersaline environments: methanol (MeOH); dimethylsulfide (DMS); monomethylamine (MMA); and acetate. As expected, high concentrations of TMA and MMA stimulated methane production to a greater extent than the controls across the entire salinity gradient sampled and there was also demonstrated use of 13 C-labeled methanol at all of the Guerrero Negro sites.

50|$|Almost all of {{the organic}} {{hydrogen}} is exchangeable to some extent. Isotopic exchange of organic hydrogen will reorder the distribution of deuterium and often incorporate external hydrogen. Generally, more mature materials are more substantially exchanged. With effective exchange, aliphatic hydrogen can finally reach isotopic equilibrium at the final stage. Equilibrium <b>fractionation</b> <b>factor</b> varies among different hydrogen sites. For example, aliphatic hydrogen isotope fractionation depends on the carbon atom that the hydrogen atom bonds with. To the first order, alkyl hydrogen isotope composition follows this trend: δDPrimary carbon < δDSecondary carbon < δDTertiary carbon. The fractionation factors between carbon sites also decrease with increasing temperature. This can be potentially used as a thermo-history indicator. The fractionation between whole molecule and water can be estimated by averaging all hydrogen-positions, and {{this leads to a}} relatively small variation of equilibrium fractionation between different groups of hydrocarbons and water. A theoretical prediction estimated this to be -80‰ to -95‰ for steranes, -90‰ to -95‰ for hopanes, and -70‰ to -95‰ for typical cycloparaffins between 0 °C to 100 °C. At the temperature of the oil window and gas window, the equilibrium fractionation between different group of organic molecules is relatively small, as compared with large primary signals.|$|E

This suggests that silica deposition in the batch-reactors is kinetically-dominated {{at the start of the}} experiments but approaches a metastable equilibrium after ca. 400 hours. Modelled kinetic <b>fractionation</b> <b>factors</b> range from 0. 9965 at 10 °C, to 0. 9976 at 20 °C and 0. 9993 at 35 °C and pH 8. 5, whereas equilibrium isotope effects are smaller and range from 0. 9995 at 10 °C, to 1. 000 at 20 °C and 1. 0005 at 35 °C. Our results suggest that large isotope effects are only expressed in natural systems where dissolved and precipitated silica are not equilibrated, implying that the kinetic conditions of non-biogenic silica precipitation provide important constraints on silicon isotope ratios of siliceous rocks, with particular relevance for those preserved in the Archean chert recor...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the large}} mass {{difference}} between the two isotopes, D/H ratios can be strongly affected by chemical processes. Thus, they can be sensitive monitors of fluid source, temperature, and fluid-rock interactions in geologic settings. The lack of confidence in <b>fractionation</b> <b>factors</b> has significantly hindered realization of the potential of D/H ratios in geochemical studies. The authors describe a new experimental method, relying on SIMS analysis, that allows the precise determination of mineral-water D/H <b>fractionation</b> <b>factors,</b> and the analytical considerations that are required to make both precise and accurate measurements. The development of this method is {{based on the fact that}} diffusion rates are markedly anisotropic in many hydrous minerals, varying by over five orders of magnitude depending on the crystallographic orientation. The diffusion rates can be determined by conducting controlled exchange experiments of fixed duration using isotopically labeled waters that are enriched (strongly) with D, and then measuring the depth profile by SIMS...|$|R
40|$|The {{time-dependent}} quantum wave packet {{method is}} used to study {{the dynamics of the}} photodissociation processes for the isotopomers (NNO) -N- 14 -N- 14 -O- 16, (NNO) -N- 14 -N- 15 -O- 16, (NNO) -N- 15 -N- 14 -O- 16, (NNO) -N- 15 -N- 15 -O- 16, (NNO) -N- 14 -N- 14 -O- 17 and (NNO) -N- 14 -N- 14 -O- 18. In general, the computed isotopic <b>fractionation</b> <b>factors</b> derived from the absorption cross sections of five heavy isotopomers are in good agreement with the experimental results. Relative to the (NNO) -N- 14 -N- 14 -O- 16 isotopomer, the N- 2 rotational state distributions for the isotopically nitrogen substituted N 2 O are found to be entirely shifted to higher rotational states. Similar to its isotopic <b>fractionation</b> <b>factors,</b> the N- 2 rotational state distributions for the asymmetric isotopomers (NNO) -N- 14 -N- 15 -O- 16, (NNO) -N- 15 -N- 14 -O- 16 are found to be observably different...|$|R
