40|$|Almost {{a billion}} persons lack access to {{improved}} drinking water, and diarrheal diseases cause an estimated 1. 87 million deaths per year. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) tablets are widely recommended for household water treatment to reduce diarrhea. Because NaDCC is directly added to untreated water sources, concerns {{have been raised}} about the potential health impact of disinfection by-products. This study investigated trihalomethane (THM) production in water from six sources used for drinking (0. 6 – 888. 5 nephelometric turbidity units) near Arusha, Tanzania. No sample collected at 1, 8, and 24 hours after NaDCC addition exceeded the World Health Organization guideline values for either individual or total THMs. Ceramic filtration, sand <b>filtration,</b> <b>cloth</b> filtration, and settling and decanting were not effective mitigation strategies to reduce THM formation. Chlorine residual and THM formation {{were not significantly different}} in NaDCC and sodium hypochlorite treatment. Household chlorination of turbid and non-turbid waters did not create THM concentrations that exceeded health risk guidelines...|$|E
40|$|The master's {{thesis is}} based on the {{executed}} measurements of suspended solid contents, COD contents and flows on the tested depth-cloth filtration device Mini filter 1 on WWTP Domžale-Kamnik. The measurements were carried out in the period from 03. 07. 2012 – 20. 9. 2012 once a day from Monday till Friday on the tested filtration device and namely flow measurements and reading of heights in the filtration device chambers and reading of suspended solid contents (TSS) on the continuous measurement on the outflow from the secondary clarifier. Measuring of parameters TSS and COD was carried out in the laboratory. After 17 th of August 2012, the testing of tested filtration device was upgraded by including the simulation of increased load with TSS on the inflow into the device. From that day on, the load with TSS on the inflow into the tested device Mini filter 1 was gradually increased. The purpose of simulation was to reach the load point with TSS where the cloth filtration device Mini filter 1 will be constantly in the procedure of cleaning or removing the captured solid particles from the <b>filtration</b> <b>cloth.</b> This point wasn't reached. Yet a minimum time during rinsing under 2 minutes was achieved. Meaning, that the device was once again in the state of cleaning less than 2 minutes. The cleaning procedure didn't affect the filtration process of inflow water...|$|E

The hexane contained in the extracted Jatropha oil was removed by distillation while the crude oil extract was collected in a beaker [34].|$|R
40|$|There is an {{overview}} of secondary methods for NOX removal from stationary sources {{in the first part}} of master’s thesis. There are well known methods as SCR o SNCR, but also new and experimental ones. An accent is putting on catalytic <b>filtration,</b> especially on <b>cloth</b> filter, which will be used for experiments. An important part of master’s thesis is a project of new experimental unit for experiments with cloth and ceramic catalytic filters as well as with a bit of <b>cloth</b> <b>filtration</b> material. Unit has compact proportions, high-class measurement and control and wide application spectra. Other advantages of this equipment are fast and easy cleaning and installation. This unit, called INTEQ II, can be used in plants or in laboratories. There is prediction model created together with new technology. It enables calculation of efficiency at catalytic filters with variable conditions without many experiments. This model is elaborate and will be finished with dates from measuring. There in only summary of planned experiments in this thesis, because measurements at new unit have not done yet. Experiences with operations at unit INTEQ I were used for proposal of new equipment and for experiments planning...|$|R
40|$|Chlor-Floc (CF) {{emergency}} {{water purification}} tablets were tested for bactericidal, virucidal, and cysticidal efficacy in water at temperatures ranging from 5 to 25 °C. The minimal required log reduction was achieved for bacteria, Giardia muris, and rotavirus, but CF did not achieve the required log reduction of poliovirus {{at any of}} the temperatures or times investigated. The biocidal properties of the CF tablet were equivalent to if not greater than those of the Globaline iodine tablet, and the CF tablet was a more rapid cysticide under several potential use conditions. Therefore, it is a suitable substitute for iodine tablets for emergency purification of drinking water. Clarification of turbid waters was effective, but <b>filtration</b> through a <b>cloth</b> is necessary to prevent flocculated sediment from entering the canteen. The CF tablets met military requirements for emergency water purification and are safe and acceptable for use by the military...|$|R
40|$|Unwoven cloth {{coated with}} 32 mg/g of a {{copolymer}} of N-benzyl- 4 -vinyl-pyridinium chloride and styrene {{was found to}} be effective in removing micro-organisms from water. In experiments demonstrating removal of Escherichia coli by filtration through ten sheets of the unwoven cloth, the rate of removal was 99. 99 % at a filtration rate of 2. 6 cm/h, and remained at 99 % even at a high filtration rate of 300 cm/h and a low influent concentration of the bacterial cells such as 10 (3) cells/ml. The rate of removal tended to increase with a decrease in the influent bacterial concentration. Seven other bacteria and two yeasts were effectively removed by filtration through the unwoven <b>cloth.</b> <b>Filtration</b> through the unwoven cloth was also effective in removing spores of fungi from water but was not very effective in removing bacteriophage T 4 from aqueous solution...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this study is}} on water quality in four slum {{communities}} in the City of Bhuj, India. In order to determine key variables affecting water quality in surveyed households, the interrelation between household water quality, environmental services, and demographic, social and financial factors was examined. The data used in this study draws on a household survey and the analysis of water samples collected within the targeted slum communities. As faecal contamination of drinking water is a major health risk in small-community supplies, water samples were tested for E. coli bacteria using the membrane-filter method. In a next step, the efficiency of three water treatment methods – <b>filtration</b> through <b>cloth,</b> chlorination and solar disinfection – was tested. Considering various factors, solar disinfection is identified to be the most appropriate method for households in most slum areas. The analysis shows that the water supply and sanitation situation of a household has an effect on that household’s drinking water quality. Personal endeavours to protect family members from disease can be greatly supported by the provision of safe drinking water, adequate sanitation facilities and wastewater removal systems to every household. Furthermore, it appears that most slum dwellers are not aware of the interdependent relation between environmental health and their personal health conditions. It is therefore argued that awareness raising measures in this area can also be an effective means of supporting personal endeavours to improve household financial situations. ...|$|R
30|$|In the {{classical}} optimization, the 15 % {{was found to}} be the optimized concentration, which agrees well with the previous studies, where 4 – 20 % concentration was optimal (Houshmand et al. 2013; Kaur and Arora 2009; Sood et al. 2015). The best/optimal concentration (15 %) and extraction temperature of 40  °C agreed well with earlier studies, where 40 – 45  °C was the best (Akowuah and Zhari 2010; Chew et al. 2011). This may be due to increased solubility of the responsible metabolites at this temperature. Similarly, extraction time of 20  min is in line with earlier reports (Alberti et al. 2014; Mihaylova et al. 2015). Optimal pH (5.0) goes well with earlier observations reporting pH of 3.0 – 5.8 to be the best (Rahimi and Hasanloo 2016; Salama and Marraiki 2010) and may be attributed to better stability of the bioactive molecules under natural conditions. <b>Filtration</b> through muslin <b>cloth</b> had a slightly better result in this study and was taken up for further work. It may be due to larger pore size of the muslin cloth which allows the responsible active molecules to easily pass resulting in a better activity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{scheme is}} {{proposed}} {{for the treatment of}} the leather plant effluent using membrane based separation processes. The effluent coming out from the various upstream units of the leather plant (except chrome tanning) are combined and a two step pressure driven membrane processes involving nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) are adopted after a pretreatment consisting of gravity settling, coagu-lation, and <b>cloth</b> <b>filtration.</b> The entire membrane separation scheme is validated by con-ducting experiments under a continuous cross flow mode. A detailed parametric study for cross flow experiments is investigated to observe the effects of the operating con-ditions, i. e., the transmembrane pressure drop and the cross flow velocity on the permeate flux and quality for both NF and RO. Using a combination of osmotic pressure and solution diffusion model for both NF and RO, the effective osmotic pressure coefficient, solute diffusivity, and the solute permeability through the membrane are obtained by optimizing the experimental permeate flux and concen-tration (in terms of total dissolved solids) values for this complex industrial effluent. The BOD and COD values of the finally treated effluent are well within the permissible limits (in India) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aflatoxin}} B 1 degrading {{abilities of}} two different ruminants were compared in this study. One set of experiments evaluated the aflatoxin B 1 degradation ability of different rumen fluid donors (steers vs. goats) {{as well as the}} rumen fluid <b>filtration</b> method (cheese <b>cloth</b> filtered vs. 0. 45 µm Millipore) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Additional studies examined aflatoxin B 1 degradation by collecting rumen fluid at different times (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 h) after feeding. Cannulated Holstein steers (740 ± 10 kg bw) and Korean native goats (26 ± 3 kg bw) were fed a 60 % timothy and 40 % commercial diet with free access to water. Rumen fluid from Korean native goats demonstrated higher (p < 0. 01) aflatoxin B 1 degradability than Holstein steers. However, filtration method had no significant influence on degradability. In addition, aflatoxin degradation did not depend upon rumen fluid collection time after feeding, as no significant differences were observed. Finally, a comparison of two types of diet high in roughage found aflatoxin degradability in goats was higher with timothy hay opposed to rice straw, although individual variation existed. Thus, our findings showed the aflatoxin degradability is comparatively higher in goats compared to steers...|$|R
5000|$|An {{interview}} with a coca farmer published in 2003 described a mode of production by acid-base extraction that has changed little since 1905. Roughly 625 lb of leaves were harvested per hectare, six times per year. The leaves were dried for half a day, then chopped into small pieces with a strimmer and sprinkled {{with a small amount}} of powdered cement (replacing sodium carbonate from former times). Several hundred pounds of this mixture were soaked in 50 gal of gasoline for a day, then the gasoline was removed and the leaves were pressed for remaining liquid, after which they could be discarded. Then battery acid (weak sulfuric acid) was used, one bucket per 25 kg of leaves, to create a phase separation in which the cocaine free base in the gasoline was acidified and extracted into a few buckets of [...] "murky-looking smelly liquid". Once powdered caustic soda was added to this, the cocaine precipitated and could be removed by <b>filtration</b> through a <b>cloth.</b> The resulting material, when dried, was termed pasta and sold by the farmer. The 3750 pound yearly harvest of leaves from a hectare produced 2.5 kg of pasta, approximately 40-60% cocaine. Repeated recrystallization from solvents, producing pasta lavada and eventually crystalline cocaine were performed at specialized laboratories after the sale.|$|R
40|$|To meet stricter {{effluent}} discharge limits of total phosphorus, microscreens {{can be applied}} for tertiary effluent treatment. The Rya WWTP has recently been upgraded with microscreens {{in the form of}} disc filters. Extensive characterisation of the wastewater from different locations in the plant (influent, after primary settling) and secondary settler effluent, was performed to increase the understanding of the potential of removing different components from the wastewater. The wastewater was fractionated by <b>filtration</b> through filter <b>cloths</b> with pore sizes 40, 20, 15, and 10 µm and through finer filters with pore size 1. 2, 0. 45, 0. 2 and 0. 1 µm. Particle size analysis (PSA) was used to assess the removal efficiency of the filter cloths. High removal degrees were achieved were particles larger or equal in size to the pore size were strained. Some floc break-up took place leading to an increased number of small particles (1 - 5 µm) after filtration. The suspended solids concentration could be reduced to 1 mg/l with total phosphorus concentrations of < 0. 2 mg/l. Some removal of metals could be observed when filtering wastewater with higher concentrations (influent and secondary settler effluent) whereas no effect could be seen for the effluent wastewater, probably due to the low concentrations present. The results from this study indicate a poor removal efficiency of pathogens measured as indicator microorganisms...|$|R
40|$|Water is a {{major media}} for {{carrying}} the cause of illness {{in the world and}} particularly in rural communities. The objectives of this study were to evaluate access to safe drinking water, water purification techniques and water-borne disease incidence in tribal region of Visakhapatnam District. 100 households were randomly selected with structured interview questions being administered in the four divisions of the District. Approximately 60 % of the households got water from unimproved sources such as unprotected dug well, surface water and unprotected springs. The commonly used water purification technologies in the study area included boiling (64 %), disinfection using chlorination (4 %), <b>cloth</b> <b>filtration</b> (14 %) and ceramic filtration (2 %), while 16 % of the population did not purify the water. Out of the 100 households, 20 % households indicated that at least one member of the household had suffered from water-borne diseases in the past year. Viral fever was the most prevalence diseases in the four mandals and high of 43 % fevers are observed in the CHC (Community Health Centre) Araku valley the year 2011 and low cases was founded in Dumbriguda PHC, and gradual decrease of viral fever cases was observed in all the PHCs. Whereas many households can easily access improved water sources, access to safe drinking water was still a major challenge. There was inconsistent and inadequate utilization of water purification techniques leading to consumption of contaminated water even after purification had been carried out...|$|R
40|$|Globally, {{over one}} billion {{people do not}} have access to safe {{drinking}} water. The majority of these people live in developing nations, where large-scale drinking water treatment projects may not provide a viable solution because of a lack of skilled laborers, consistent and reliable electricity, materials, sufficient economic capital, and/or fuel sources. Appropriate non-conventional drinking water treatment technologies may provide a solution to these problems, particularly if such technologies are composed of materials readily accessible to the population. Three treatment technologies whose materials are easily acquired throughout the developed and developing world are sari filtration, solar disinfection, and citrus fruit acidification. While some of these technologies have undergone extensive investigation for pathogen removal and inactivation efficiencies, no relationship between the technologies using similar methods and microorganisms has been established. In this research, the removal efficiency and pathogen inactivation of these appropriate technologies was investigated using three indicator organisms: a bacteria (E. coif), a virus (MS 2 coliphage), and a surrogate for protozoa (aerobic bacterial spores, B. subtilis). The optimum conditions for pathogen inactivation and removal was investigated by examining a number of variables. As a single treatment method will not provide the safest option for drinking water, a combination of these technologies was also investigated in this research. Ultimately, significant inactivation of E. coli and MS 2 coliphage occurred within 4 hours using solar disinfection and 24 hours using citrus fruit acidification. No inactivation occurred for B. subtilis using either of these methods, nor was any significant removal of indicator organisms found when testing sari filtration. Removing the pulp of lemon and lime juice with sari <b>cloth</b> <b>filtration</b> showed no significant removal in MS 2 coliphage. However, it was noted that the addition of organic acids to solar disinfection greatly increases the time and inactivation of E. coli and MS 2 coliphage. Additionally, the combination of organic acids and solar disinfection can greatly improve MS 2 coliphage inactivation on cloudy days. While this research is still in the preliminary stage, the use of appropriate and indigenous treatment options holds a tremendous amount of promise, and should be further studied...|$|R
40|$|The {{stress on}} water supply systems is {{increasing}}, among others due to pollution, increasing demands, source depletion and climate change. More sustainable solutions {{with respect to}} water supply will decrease the stress. Rainwater harvesting {{can be one of}} these sustainable solutions. Depending on the characteristics of the rainwater harvesting system it can increase water availability and limit urban flooding and erosion by water retention. Furthermore it can limit subsidence by limiting groundwater extraction or by increasing infiltration. Finally rainwater is a relatively clean and free water source. This research investigates the possibilities for domestic rainwater harvesting in an off-grid urban area in Serang (Indonesia). Current water infrastructure in this area is found insufficient. Technical, economical, legal, social and cultural aspects are tackled in this research. This is done by conducting semi-structured interviews, creating a conceptual model of a rainwater harvesting system, and by doing water quality measurements, cost calculations and literature research. While rainwater harvesting is not preferred socially, use is accepted in the case study area. Also, no relevant restrictions are present regarding rainwater use on national level. In the analysed existing rainwater harvesting tanks the water quality meet the WHO guidelines for all measured parameters, except microbial contamination. Suggested treatment steps include first flush, <b>cloth</b> <b>filtration</b> and boiling. Boiling is solely required for potable purposes and first flush water can be used for low end purposes. Furthermore, closed tanks or small fish can prevent mosquitos. Risk groups, including young children, elderly, people with weakened immune systems or skin injuries should be careful with the use rainwater. Depending on the roof size, tank size and operating scenario a certain tap flow can be expected from a rainwater harvesting system. It is found that for a tank of 2 m 3 and a roof of 100 m 2 an average tap flow of between 116 and 186 liter/day can be expected. This tank size has the lowest water price per cubic meter (between 0. 40 - 1. 11 euro per m 3), in case a realistic roof size is connected. Payback periods were found to vary largely depending on the assumption regarding the fresh water requirement, and the operating scenario. Payback periods are around 2 and 8 years in case a fresh water need of 80 and 20 liter a family a day is taken into account. Payback periods decrease for larger fresh water needs, {{due to the fact that}} more of the expensive bottled water is replaced. In this case yearly savings based on investment increases. This research shows that rainwater harvesting is a suitable technique for the improvement of both quality and quantity of the water supply in Serang. Focus can be on the awareness, acceptance and knowledge of the population. Small changes can improve the operation of existing systems. Systems should be closed, contain overflow, tap and first flush. Harvest can increase largely by connecting the entire roof, and by considering the operating scenario carefully. Governmental institutions could help the local population with these improvements and by water quality measurements. Scientific research can focus on the remaining health risk related to rainwater use, methods for quality control of systems, constructions to bridge the large investment costs or improvements of the conceptual model used.
