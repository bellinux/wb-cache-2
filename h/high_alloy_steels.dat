50|$|Crankshafts can {{be forged}} from a steel bar usually through roll forging or cast in ductile steel. Today {{more and more}} {{manufacturers}} tend to favor the use of forged crankshafts due to their lighter weight, more compact dimensions and better inherent damping. With forged crankshafts, vanadium microalloyed steels are mostly used as these steels can be air cooled after reaching high strengths without additional heat treatment, with exception to the surface hardening of the bearing surfaces. The low alloy content also makes the material cheaper than <b>high</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels.</b> Carbon steels are also used, but these require additional heat treatment to reach the desired properties.

From {{information}} on M, for lath and lenticular martensite {{the driving force}} {{for the start of}} a formation of the two types of martensite was calculated in a number of Fe-X systems.

40|$|Purpose: The {{study on}} structure-property {{relations}} of heavily cold worked and aged martensite in two high-alloy structural steels was presented. The {{aim was to}} understand properties of the sheet products better and thus extend applications of the newly developed cobalt-free maraging and precipitation hardening stainless steels. Design/methodology/approach: Mechanical tests were performed on cold rolled and aged specimens. Microstructures were analyzed using TEM and SEM. The crystallographic texture was analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction and ADC method. Findings: In the process of cold working and ageing both <b>high</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> studied could develop yield strength in excess of 1600 MPa. The main strengthening mechanism was precipitation hardening, while work hardening contribution to the strength was very limited. Overaging commences after prolonged treatment above 500 ºC, and in both steels {{could be related to}} reverted austenite. The texture developed by cold working was the one known as rolling texture type. Research limitations/implications: In this study the advantage is taken of the high strength that is developed by cold working followed by ageing. Further research is needed for the sheet or strip produced by cold working and annealed before fabrication. Practical implications: The properties of the <b>high</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> studied make them suitable for advanced sheet applications, e. g. as an airborne structural equipment. After welding, strength of the precipitation hardening steels could be largely restored by ageing, because their strength does not rely on strain hardening. Originality/value: Analysis of the cold worked properties, microstructure and texture, allowed for better understanding of the microstructure-property relationships in the low strain hardening high alloy sheet steels. The results obtained are of practical value for the development, production and manufacture of the ultra-high strength sheet steels...|$|E
