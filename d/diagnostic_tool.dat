5|$|Paracetamol may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or urine as a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tool</b> in clinical poisoning situations or {{to aid in}} the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30mg/l, which equals 200 µmol/L. Levels of 30–300mg/L (200–2000 µmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50–400mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated colorimetric techniques, gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.|$|E

40|$|Particular <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools</b> may {{isolate the}} {{signature}} {{left on the}} oscillation frequencies {{by the presence of}} a small convective core. Their frequency derivative is expected to provide information about convective core's properties and stellar age. The main goal of this work is to study the potential of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools</b> with regards to the inference of stellar age and stellar core's properties. For that, we computed <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools</b> and their frequency derivatives from the oscillation frequencies of main-sequence models with masses between 1. 0 and 1. 6 M_ and with different physics. We considered the dependence of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools</b> on stellar age and {{on the size of the}} relative discontinuity in the squared sound speed at the edge of the convectively unstable region. We find that the absolute value of the frequency derivatives of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools</b> increases as the star evolves on the main sequence. The fraction of stellar main-sequence evolution for models with masses > 1. 2 M_ may be estimated from the frequency derivatives of two of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools.</b> For lower mass models, constraints on the convective core's overshoot can potentially be derived based on the analysis of the same derivatives. For at least 35 per cent of our sample of stellar models the frequency derivative of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tools</b> takes its maximum absolute value on the frequency range where observed oscillations may be expected.

5|$|The use of {{ultrasonography}} {{in medicine}} soon followed in different {{locations around the}} world. In the mid-1950s more research was undertaken by Professor Ian Donald et al., in Glasgow, which advanced the practical technology and applications of ultrasound. In 1963, in France, Léandre Pourcelot started on his thesis, which was presented in 1964, and used pulsed Doppler for blood flow calculation as its subject. This was followed up by Peronneau in 1969. Dr. Gene Strandness and the bio-engineering group at the University of Washington who conducted research on Doppler ultrasound as a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tool</b> for vascular disease, published their first work in 1967. The first report published about the venous system appeared around 1967–1968.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tool</b> for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E
5|$|In nearby objects (within our Milky Way galaxy) {{observed}} redshifts {{are almost}} always related to the line-of-sight velocities associated with the objects being observed. Observations of such redshifts and blueshifts have enabled astronomers to measure velocities and parametrize the masses of the orbiting stars in spectroscopic binaries, a method first employed in 1868 by British astronomer William Huggins. Similarly, small redshifts and blueshifts detected in the spectroscopic measurements of individual stars are one way astronomers {{have been able to}} diagnose and measure the presence and characteristics of planetary systems around other stars and have even made very detailed differential measurements of redshifts during planetary transits to determine precise orbital parameters. Finely detailed measurements of redshifts are used in helioseismology to determine the precise movements of the photosphere of the Sun. Redshifts have also been used to make the first measurements of the rotation rates of planets, velocities of interstellar clouds, the rotation of galaxies, and the dynamics of accretion onto neutron stars and black holes which exhibit both Doppler and gravitational redshifts. Additionally, the temperatures of various emitting and absorbing objects can be obtained by measuring Doppler broadening – effectively redshifts and blueshifts over a single emission or absorption line. By measuring the broadening and shifts of the 21-centimeter hydrogen line in different directions, astronomers have been able to measure the recessional velocities of interstellar gas, which in turn reveals the rotation curve of our Milky Way. Similar measurements have been performed on other galaxies, such as Andromeda. As a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>tool,</b> redshift measurements {{are one of the most}} important spectroscopic measurements made in astronomy.|$|E
