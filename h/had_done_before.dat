5|$|At Devarakota, Harsha kills Ratnam and Sashi at {{the factory}} and construes it as an {{accident}} due to an inadvertent short-circuit, similar to what Sashi <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> Ravikanth's arrest years before. The film ends with Ravikanth and his family visiting Rao's house on Sankranthi, where Harsha, now Charuseela's husband, receives them warmly.|$|E

He {{went through a}} long design {{process in which the}} cover's colors, fonts, and text positioning were changed frequently. Veloso chose the color purple for the cover's background because it is mentioned multiple times in the album itself.|$|E

5|$|When Refn {{read the}} first {{screenplay}} for Drive, he was more intrigued by {{the concept of a}} man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the story itself. Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script as it was unlike anything he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>before,</b> Gosling had concerns about Refn's desire to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.|$|E
5|$|Mehmed II and {{his successors}} {{continued}} to consider themselves heirs to the Roman Empire until {{the demise of}} the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century following World War 1. They considered that they had simply shifted its religious basis as Constantine <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>before,</b> and they continued to refer to their conquered Eastern Roman inhabitants (Orthodox Christians) as Rûm. Meanwhile, the Danubian Principalities (whose rulers also considered themselves the heirs of the Eastern Roman Emperors) harboured Orthodox refugees, including some Byzantine nobles.|$|E
5|$|Monson {{initiated}} French-speaking proselytizing {{efforts in}} Quebec. He directed increased missionary work to {{immigrants from the}} Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Italy, Soviet Union and Hungary. Jacob de Jager, a future LDS general authority, was among the immigrant converts. Monson encouraged members to remain in eastern Canada, instead of migrating to Utah or Alberta as many members <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>before,</b> to help build the church's presence. To help encourage members to stay in Canada, increase the perception of permanence, and better reach potential converts, he started a major construction program for new meetinghouses. Until then, most branches had used rented halls.|$|E

5|$|On May 12, 1995 Tkach {{had surgery}} to remove his gall bladder. Shortly thereafter, he was readmitted to the {{hospital}} because of severe intestine and back pain. Surgeons then removed a grapefruit-size tumor from his intestines and discovered he had colon cancer. In a letter to ministers, dated September 6, Tkach {{announced that he was}} also diagnosed with bone cancer. He elected not to undertake radiation treatments. As Armstrong <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> him, Tkach named a successor to become pastor general in the event of his death. In that case, it was Tkach's son, Joseph Tkach Jr.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} Air Force {{play of the}} second half, quarterback Chance Harridge ran up {{the middle of the}} field for a 21-yard gain. The Falcons {{followed}} that first-down play with a series of rushes that resulted in another first down, this time in Virginia Tech territory. But as the Hokies <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> them, the Falcons faltered inside opposition territory. Instead of punting the ball, however, Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry kept his offense on the field to attempt to gain the needed twoyards on fourth down. The attempt was unsuccessful, and Tech's offense returned to the field with 7:40 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The impact Reeves had was immediate. As Bill Parcells <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> in 1984, Reeves named Phil Simms the {{starting}} quarterback and released Hostetler. They won their first three games, and five of their first six. The defense was back to its Parcells-era levels and allowed more than 20 points once all season. With two games to go, the Giants were 11–3 and battling for an Eastern Division crown and a first round bye. However, they were upset by Phoenix, 17–6, in the next to {{last week of the}} season, setting up a winner–take–all game against the Dallas Cowboys in the season finale. Though the Giants played well, it was Emmitt Smith's memorable performance with a separated shoulder that led the Cowboys to a 16–13 overtime win, giving the Cowboys a sweep of the season series. Despite the loss, the Giants made the playoffs as a Wild Card and won their first round game 17–10 over the Minnesota Vikings. However, they were then defeated by the San Francisco 49ers 44–3, in their worst performance of the season in the second round.|$|E

5|$|Nigel Kneale {{had been}} unhappy with Hammer's {{adaptation}} of The Quatermass Experiment, {{partly because he}} received no extra remuneration {{from the sale of}} the film rights and partly because of the changes made in the film to his original television script. In the wake of his dissatisfaction, Kneale exerted pressure on the BBC to allow him to be more involved in the sale of the rights to his work. Despite being in the final months of his BBC contract, Kneale was allowed to collaborate with Hammer on the adaptation of Quatermass II. The first draft of the screenplay was written by Kneale with input from producer Anthony Hinds. Subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest, as he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> on The Quatermass Xperiment. Guest recalled of Kneale's script that there was “lots of philosophising and very down-to-earth thinking but it was too long, it would not have held screenwise. So, again, I had to tailor it and sharpen it and hopefully not ruin it”. The script was submitted to the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) in April 1956. BBFC reader Audrey Field commented, “There should be the customary general caution that the sky is not the limit, either in sights or sounds”. The BBFC's main objection was to a scene in which a guard from the Winnerden Flats complex murders a family having a picnic. This scene was omitted from the final film, although it is present in the original television presentation.|$|E
25|$|In 1498, {{there was}} a turning point when Girindrawardhana was deposed by his vice regent, Udara. After this coup, the war between Demak and Daha receded, with some sources saying Raden Patah, Sultan of Demak, left Majapahit alone as his father <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>before,</b> while others said Udara agreed to become a vassal of Demak, even marrying Raden Patah's {{youngest}} daughter.|$|E

25|$|John Eardley Wilmot {{was educated}} at Derby School, then with Dr John Hunter at Lichfield, where his contemporaries {{included}} Samuel Johnson and David Garrick. He {{then went to}} Westminster School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1727, before studying law in London at the Inner Temple, as his father and older brother <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> him, and was called to the bar in 1732.|$|E
25|$|Despite Shea's legal successes, he {{lost control}} of the Teamsters union.

Subsequently, nearly all of Shea's backers withdrew their support for his presidency.|$|E

25|$|Klitschko {{defeated}} Chambers by knockout {{five seconds}} {{before the end of}} the final round. He was criticized between rounds by his trainer Emanuel Steward for not fighting aggressively enough and began punching more often during the final round than he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> which eventually led to his left hook hitting Chambers to the forehead. The punch made Chambers fall forwards and lost consciousness for an extended period of time. The referee stepped in and called an end to the contest instantly.|$|E

When her marriage to Barrocchi broke down in 1919, the dancer abruptly disappeared for a time, as she <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> in America.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Napoleon's {{invasion}} in 1798, {{almost all of}} Egypt's educational, legal, public health, and social welfare issues were {{in the hands of}} religious functionaries. Ottoman rule reinforced the public and political roles of the ulama (religious scholars), as Mamluk rule <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> the Ottomans, because Islam was the state religion and because political divisions in the country were based on religious divisions. During the 19th and 20th centuries, successive governments made extensive efforts to limit the role of the ulama in public life and to bring religious institutions under closer state control.|$|E
