25|$|To {{obtain a}} Professional certificate, the {{applicant}} must have completed a NYS-approved {{teacher education program}} at a college/university and hold a master's <b>degree</b> <b>or</b> <b>above.</b> Each state has different requirements to become a permanently certified teacher, and the requirements keep increasing. For example, professional certification in NYS requires three years of classroom teaching experience. It also requires being mentored by a certified teacher within the first year teaching. However NYS no longer offers permanent certification to those who haven't already been certified by February 2004.The Professional certificate replaces it. To maintain a professional certificate, a teacher must complete 100 hours of professional development every five years. These professional development hours are decreased by a few percentages for every year teaching in a non-public school. One {{does not have to}} teach in New York State to maintain their certificate as many New York teachers teach in Connecticut and New Jersey.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{long-term}} effects of institutions of higher education (IHEs) on regional economic growth with an application of spatial econometrics. IHEs are classified based on the fields of programs offered and degree-granting activities. I use county-level data for the contiguous US to estimate the marginal effects of IHEs on the changes in log employment and log wages in own counties and neighboring counties between 1970 and 2000. Evidence is found of knowledge spillovers of IHEs, especially for cross-county spillovers. Counties with more IHEs on location or in their neighboring counties experienced modestly faster employment growth over the 30 -year period. Institutions offering accredited business programs had much larger effects than the others. With respect to degree-granting activities, only those institutions awarding bachelor's <b>degrees</b> <b>or</b> <b>above</b> had significant growth-boosting effects. When industrial mix of counties is controlled for, own-county effects diminish except for business programs, whereas all neighboring-county effects prevail...|$|R

40|$|The soluble cytoplasmic {{fraction}} of an homogenate from peritoneal rat mast cells, demonstrated {{a considerable amount}} of catalytic activity which promotes the transfer of phosphate from creatine phosphate to ADP. The plasma membrane, mitochondrial and microsomal fractions show negligible amounts of the catalyst.

The overall behaviour of the catalyst indicates it to be a creatine phosphokinase (CPK), an enzyme considered important to muscle and nerve tissues. The CPK is probably not encapsulated within the mast cells' perigranular membranes and is retained in the soluble cytoplasm during exocytosis. The possible role of CPK, as to whether it is assisting in maintaining proper levels of intracellular ATP during exocytosis, and/or whether it is associated with components of the mast cells' contractile apparatus, is discussed...|$|R
