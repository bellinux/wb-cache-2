The efforts of women to equal man in studies, work, etc., while still {{claiming}} their sex privileges, with the dissolution of club and society life, are leading to a 'race suicide.' This ought not to be. Woman is anatomically, physiologically, and emotionally evolved for one sole and single purpose, any departure therefrom being done at the violation of her best ideals and a misdirection of energy.|$|E
500|$|... e.The immense {{scope of}} The Century caused {{headaches}} for those developing it. It survived three {{major changes in}} narrative approach, three different executive producers, and various attempts to axe the entire project. By the time it aired, {{all of the people}} interviewed for their anecdotes of World War I had died. Jennings, though, downplayed criticism of the program's rocky history. [...] "Name me a news organization that doesn't have some degree of turmoil on a major project," [...] he said. [...] "What people care about in The New York Times is what gets in the paper. It's the same with us. There {{are people out there who}} think their job is to set the bar for us, but the bar for me is set by the audience, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> real hunger out there from everyone I encounter to relive and experience and learn from what's gone on over the last 100 years." ...|$|E
500|$|During a {{spin-off}} series titled , Gilly and Josh Ashworth head to Manchester. The series {{explored the}} dangers of bringe drinking and {{was funded by the}} Home Office. This was the start of changes implemented to the character that would continue into the main series. During the spin-off he was portrayed having negative experiences with excessive alcohol consumption, of this Quinlan said: [...] "Gilly and Josh had a little fight over Ruby (Nika McGuigan), so the character did change due to all the drink consumed. His mood changed further when he attempted to run after Josh after the scuffle, and fell down a set of stairs in the nightclub, losing some of his teeth. After the incident he couldn't wait to get back home to the village."He then stated that he wanted viewers to learn from his character's scenario and be responsible while drinking, stating: [...] "It will make people think twice about binge drinking and make people aware of the consequences if you do." [...] When the character lost his teeth it made the character's low confidence worsen, Quinlan made comment of this saying: [...] "Gilly's confidence was always low really - self-confidence, self-belief. But having no teeth isn't good to look at - not a good look. It's going to draw attention to him and not do him any favours." [...] To enable continuity the character was scripted a slight speech impediment, behind the scenes Quinlan had a special palette fitted, it was a real one fitted by real life dentists and paid for by the show, it would black the character's front teeth and leave a chipped one at the side. Quinlan also revealed it was quite difficult to speak when wearing it, but praised it as being realistic to have some form of speech impediment having teeth knocked out. Talking of his character's changes and lessons learnt during the special episodes Quinlan said: [...] "I think Gilly's learnt to chill out a little, not to follow the crowd and be a sheep. Everyone was drinking loads, he got caught up in it and he came out {{on the wrong side of}} it. So, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lesson learned there - Gilly will do his own thing and not drink as much." ...|$|E

[...] The governor's staff had stated they were responding to a Freedom of Information request from the Albany Times-Union in late June. On May 23, Spitzer's Communications Director Darren Dopp wrote an e-mail to Rich Baum, a senior Spitzer adviser, stating that [...] "records exist going way back" [...] about Bruno's use of state aircraft, and that [...] "also, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> new and different way to proceed re media. Will explain tomorrow." [...] Dopp later wrote another e-mail to Baum after a story ran in the Albany Times-Union about {{a federal grand jury}} investigation of Bruno's investments in thoroughbred racing horses, and wrote: [...] "Think travel story would fit nicely in the mix." [...] The first Freedom of Information Act request about Bruno's travel was filed by the Times Union on June 27, nearly a month after.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{sessions}} for [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", Lillywhite encouraged drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. {{to use a}} click track, but Mullen was firmly against the idea. [...] A chance meeting with Andy Newmark (of Sly & the Family Stone) – a drummer who used a click track religiously – changed Mullen's mind. [...] Mullen used the click track to stay in time for other songs on the album. Mullen said of the album in a 1983 interview, [...] "I think the drumming has always been pretty simple, I don't think {{it needs to be}} flashy. For War I use a click track, something I haven't used before, it's a way of keeping time in my headphones. When I listened to the music in time with the click track I knew I had to bring it down to the real basics. Hopefully for the next LP it will be more complicated, I'll move on. I {{think of it as a}} musical progression for myself because I learned a lot recording this album, just about my own style and that's what I wanted to do. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> definite style on War where there isn't on the previous albums." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Watson is {{well known}} for his alleged 1943 statement, [...] "I think there is a world market for maybe five computers," [...] there is scant {{evidence}} he said it. Author Kevin Maney tried to find the origin of the quote, but has been unable to locate any speeches or documents of Watson's that contain this, nor are the words present in any contemporary articles about IBM. One of the very first attributions may be found in The Experts Speak, a book written by Christopher Cerf and Victor S. Navasky in 1984, however Cerf and Navasky just quote from a book written by Morgan and Langford, Facts and Fallacies. Another early article source (May 15, 1985) is a column by Neil Morgan, a San Diego Evening Tribune writer who wrote: [...] "Forrest Shumway, chairman of The Signal Cos., doesn't make predictions. His role model is Tom Watson, then IBM chairman, who said in 1958: 'I think there is a world market for about five computers. The earliest known citation on the Internet is from 1986 on Usenet in the signature of a poster from Convex Computer Corporation as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> world market for about five computers' —Remark attributed to Thomas J. Watson (Chairman of the Board of International Business Machines), 1943". All these early quotes are questioned by Eric Weiss, an editor of the Annals of the History of Computing in ACS letters in 1985.|$|E
