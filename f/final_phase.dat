5|$|Architectural {{historian}} Anthony Emery {{argues that}} the castle was built in three phases, starting with the central keep, which he believes {{was intended as a}} largely unfortified summer residence for the Abbot.

5|$|Central to the 2009 dispute was the {{agreement}} that ended the 2007 round of strikes.

However, the Communication Workers Union said that although Royal Mail had carried out three of the phases in this way, it had refused to discuss the <b>final</b> <b>phase,</b> which concerned the government's plans for modernisation, and how these would affect the job security of Royal Mail employees.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{supported}} British {{involvement in}} the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent, abandoning any hopes of a British project during the war.
