5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes the <b>eye</b> is torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies {{a loss of}} virility and strength. The removal of Horus's <b>eye</b> is even more important, for this stolen <b>Eye</b> of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right <b>eye</b> was said to be the sun and his left <b>eye</b> the moon. The theft or destruction of the <b>Eye</b> of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost <b>Eye,</b> or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the <b>Eye</b> of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's <b>Eye</b> when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} <b>Eye</b> and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E

40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} the therapeutic outcomes of idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurisms and neuroretinitis(IRVAN) syndrome by different treatments. METHODS:Seven patients(14 <b>eyes)</b> with IRVAN {{were enrolled in}} this study and divided into different stages. There were 4 <b>eyes</b> in stage Ⅱ and 10 <b>eyes</b> in stage Ⅲ. The visual acuity(VA) was ≥ 0. 6 in 6 <b>eyes,</b> 0. 3 in 4 <b>eyes,</b> and ≤ 0. 1 in 4 <b>eyes.</b> Treatment involved retinal laser photocoagulation for peripheral retinal ischemia area in the 4 <b>eyes</b> in stage Ⅱ and panretinal laser photocoagulation(PRP) for the 10 <b>eyes</b> in stage Ⅲ. Two <b>eyes</b> in stage Ⅲ were also treated with intravitreal injection of ranibizumab and 4 <b>eyes</b> with vitrectomy before PRP. Visual acuity and fundus situations were measured after the treatments. The follow-up time was 6 mo ～ 10 a. RESULTS:After treatments, the final VA was improved in 6 <b>eyes,</b> remaining unchanged in 6 <b>eyes,</b> and decreased after improved in 2 <b>eyes.</b> It was as following:≥ 0. 6 in 9 <b>eyes,</b> 0. 3 ～ 0. 6 in 4 <b>eyes,</b> and ≤ 0. 1 in 1 <b>eyes.</b> Four <b>eyes</b> in stage Ⅱ maintained a good vision, but one of them had a new ischemia area. We treated it with PRP and there was no progression now. In stage Ⅲ, there were 2 <b>eyes</b> with unchanged VA, 2 <b>eyes</b> with improved VA, 2 <b>eyes</b> with improved VA after giving ranibizumab, 4 <b>eyes</b> with vitreous hemorrhage and with better VA after treatments, and in the 4 <b>eyes,</b> 2 <b>eyes</b> kept stable and another two had recurrent vitreous hemorrhage for several times and ended with poor vision.

CONCLUSION:PRP is effective for <b>eyes</b> in stage Ⅱ. <b>Eyes</b> in stage Ⅲ could be treated with intravitreal injection of ranibizumab or vitrectomy in addition to PRP.

After 24 - 72 h of comprehensive ocular hypotensive medications failed to control IOP, paracentesis was applied. At 1 - 2 d after IOP dropped to 21 mmHg or less, patients received trabeculectomy combined with goniosynechialysis and mitomycin(MMC).

5|$|Narrow/closed angle {{glaucoma}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} inheritable trait in the breed. It {{is a leading}} cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the <b>eye.</b> If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough, or slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle glaucoma. Symptoms can include redness in the <b>eye,</b> the <b>eye</b> itself looking cloudy, sensitivity to light and the dog may rub at their <b>eye,</b> or even rub it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful.

Further, the ability of the apparatus in glaucoma diagnosis in highly myopic <b>eyes</b> was compared with that in emmetropic <b>eyes.</b> METHODS: Healthy subjects and age-matched patients with early-stage open-angle glaucoma were divided into two groups: emmetropic <b>eyes</b> (- 1. 0 to + 1. 0 diopters) and highly myopic <b>eyes</b> (- 12. 0 to - 5. 0 diopters).

Confocal scanning laser tomographic parameters were compared among all subjects after adjustment for age and disc area. The ROC curves and sensitivity and specificity for glaucoma detection using several clinical methods were then compared between the emmetropic and highly myopic <b>eyes.</b> RESULTS: Rim area, cup/disc area ratio, mean cup depth, and cup shape measure of glaucoma <b>eyes</b> are significantly different from those of normal <b>eyes</b> in both highly myopic <b>eyes</b> and emmetropic <b>eyes.</b> Methodological overestimation of retinal nerve fiber layer cross sectional area due to optic disc tilting was suggested in the highly myopic <b>eyes.</b> The diagnostic performance of glaucoma using several discriminant methods significantly deteriorated in the highly myopic <b>eyes.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In the highly myopic glaucomatous <b>eyes,</b> confocal scanning laser tomographic parameters were significantly different from that of non-glaucomatous highly myopic <b>eyes</b> but diagnostic performance of glaucoma was deteriorated than that in emmetropic <b>eyes.</b> These findings demonstrate the utility and limitations of the apparatus in diagnosing glaucoma in highly myopic patients...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Eye</b> of Ra or <b>Eye</b> of Re is a {{being in}} ancient Egyptian mythology that {{functions}} as a feminine counterpart to the sun god Ra and a violent force that subdues his enemies. The <b>Eye</b> {{is an extension of}} Ra's power, equated with the disk of the sun, but it also behaves as an independent entity, which can be personified by a wide variety of Egyptian goddesses, including Hathor, Sekhmet, Bastet, Wadjet, and Mut. The <b>Eye</b> goddess acts as mother, sibling, consort, and daughter of the sun god. She is his partner in the creative cycle in which he begets the renewed form of himself that is born at dawn. The Eye's violent aspect defends Ra against the agents of disorder that threaten his rule. This dangerous aspect of the <b>Eye</b> goddess is often represented by a lioness or by the uraeus, or cobra, a symbol of protection and royal authority. The <b>Eye</b> of Ra is similar to the <b>Eye</b> of Horus, which belongs to a different god, Horus, but represents many of the same concepts. The disastrous effects when the <b>Eye</b> goddess rampages out of control and the efforts of the gods to return her to a benign state are a prominent motif in Egyptian mythology.|$|E
5|$|The deities {{associated}} with the <b>Eye</b> were not restricted to feline and serpent forms. Hathor's usual animal form is a cow, as {{is that of the}} closely linked <b>Eye</b> goddess Mehet-Weret.

Many <b>Eye</b> goddesses appear mainly in human form, including Neith, a sometimes warlike deity sometimes said to be the mother of the sun god, and Satet and Anuket, who were linked with the Nile cataracts and the inundation. Other such goddesses include Sothis, the deified form of the star of the same name, and Maat, the personification of cosmic order, who was connected with the <b>Eye</b> because she was said to be the daughter of Ra. Even Isis, who is usually the companion of Osiris rather than Ra, or Astarte, a deity of fertility and warfare who was imported from Canaan rather than native to Egypt, could be equated with the solar <b>Eye.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{tears of}} the <b>Eye</b> of Ra {{are part of}} a more general {{connection}} between the <b>Eye</b> and moisture.
