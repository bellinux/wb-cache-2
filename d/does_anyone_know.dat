40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} link between price points and price {{rigidity}} using two data sets: weekly scanner data and Internet data.

It's easy to say that a contractor must earn the government's trust, but what does that mean in practice? Who needs to earn whose trust? What's the timeline for doing that? How <b>does</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>know</b> when he or she is trusted? What is the relationship supposed to be like before one feels like trust has really been established? So many questions it makes my head hurt. I have always found it better to begin a relationship assuming that everyone is trustworthy until, and unless, something occurs to belie trust...|$|E

40|$|United States, {{civil service}} {{is one of}} the types or forms of supervisory, over-all {{personnel}} control legally imposed by certain major governmental jurisdictions on part or all of their operating departments and subdivisions.

40|$|This article {{uses the}} ideas of ‘strategy’ and ‘tactics’ drawn from Michel de Certeau’s The Practice of Everyday Life {{in order to examine}} two {{specific}} Scottish performances and determine their conception of mental illness, their approach to performance, and how these performances relate to the structures surrounding them. The first, The Wonderful World of Dissocia, was written by Anthony Neilson, premièred at the Edinburgh International Festival in 2004, and was directly supported by the Scottish Executive’s National Programme for Improving Mental Health and Well Being. The second, <b>Does</b> <b>Anyone</b> <b>Know,</b> is a short film resulting from work with prisoners with mental health problems in the High Dependency Unit at HMP Edinburgh by the charity Theatre NEMO, and includes performances by prisoners themselves. Taken together, these performances give some sense of the contingent position of performances of mental illness, the ways in which actors, writers, and service users act within the structures of theatres, prisons, and hospitals, to work around and within the ‘strategies’ which constitute psychiatric discourse.

40|$|Terms such as ‘knowledge {{management}} ’ and the ‘knowledge economy/society ’ only loitered on {{the margins}} of my professional language until I was asked to participate in this seminar. My own education, which propelled me into a working lifetime in the Higher Education sector, was based on the unarticulated assumption that knowledge and educational institutions are intimately related in two ways: the education system is about the production and dissemination of knowledge, and what happens within it is itself knowledge-based. Teachers know how to teach and what they teach is worth knowing. But the nature of progress is very often that what we once took for granted {{turns out to be a}} mass of problems and complexities. Education is not ‘simply ’ about the transfer of knowledge: it is about many other processes and outcomes as well. What is knowledge? Who is knowledge for? Who defines what we want to know about and why? How is knowledge used, and who benefits from (or is damaged by) these uses? Perhaps most problematic of all are the two questions: how <b>does</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>know</b> what they know? And, how do we get from knowledge to wisdom?
