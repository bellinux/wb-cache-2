25|$|This plan is used {{early in}} the morning for <b>departing</b> <b>aircraft.</b> <b>Departing</b> <b>aircraft</b> that are located at the West Cargo area will be held there until a gate {{operated}} by their airline opens. Once there is an open gate, the plane will be towed into the gate by a tug. Usually these operations take place for evening flights from 9PM to about midnight. For morning flights, it is usually around 6 am and will end around 8 am.|$|E
25|$|A {{terrorist}} incident at Gran Canaria Airport had caused many flights to be diverted to Los Rodeos, including the two accident aircraft. The airport quickly became congested with parked aircraft blocking the only taxiway and forcing <b>departing</b> <b>aircraft</b> to taxi {{on the runway}} instead. Patches of thick fog were also drifting across the airfield, preventing aircraft and control tower from seeing each other.|$|E
25|$|On , an {{arriving}} SkyWest Airlines Embraer EMB 120 nearly {{collided with}} a Republic Airline Embraer 170 Regional Jet at the junction of Runways 01L and 28R. After the SkyWest EMB 120 passed the Runway 28R threshold, the Republic E-170 was cleared for takeoff on 01L, in contradiction to local and FAA orders requiring the arriving aircraft to pass the intersection before clearing <b>departing</b> <b>aircraft</b> on the intersecting runway.|$|E

Kennedy International Airport in New York, {{crashed into}} Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse, killing {{everyone}} on the aircraft and four people on the ground. Investigations concluded that a tire burst on take-off due to metal left on the runway from a previously <b>departing</b> <b>aircraft,</b> leading to a ruptured fuel tank and resulting in engine failure and other damage. Concorde was conducting a charter flight for a German tour company.|$|E
25|$|Operation Yellow Ribbon was the {{operation}} that Transport Canada created {{to handle the}} diversion of civilian airline flights following the September 11 attacks in 2001. The operation started after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all aircraft across the United States and re-routed incoming international flights to airports in Canada. During {{the operation}}, <b>departing</b> <b>aircraft,</b> {{with the exception of}} police, military, and humanitarian flights were canceled, marking the first time that Canada shut down its airspace. As a result of Operation Yellow Ribbon, 255 aircraft were diverted to 17 different airports across the country.|$|E
25|$|All {{traffic from}} Gran Canaria, {{including}} five large airliners, had been diverted to Los Rodeos, a regional airport {{that could not}} easily accommodate them. The airport had only one runway and one major taxiway parallel to it, with four short taxiways connecting the two. While waiting for Gran Canaria airport to reopen, the diverted aircraft took up so much space that they were parked on the long taxiway, meaning {{that it could not}} be used for taxiing. Instead, <b>departing</b> <b>aircraft</b> had to taxi along the runway to position themselves for takeoff, a procedure known as a backtaxi or backtrack.|$|E

25|$|When runway {{alternation}} was introduced, aircraft generated {{significantly more}} noise on departure than when landing, so {{a preference for}} westerly operations during daylight was introduced, which continues to this day. In this mode, aircraft depart towards the west and approach from the east over London, thereby minimising the impact of noise on the most densely populated areas. Heathrow's two runways generally operate in segregated mode, whereby arriving aircraft are allocated to one runway and <b>departing</b> <b>aircraft</b> to the other. To further reduce noise nuisance to people beneath the approach and departure routes, the use of runways 27R and 27L is swapped at 15:00 each day if the wind is from the west. When landings are easterly there is no alternation; 09L remains the landing runway and 09R the departure runway due to {{the legacy of the}} now rescinded Cranford Agreement, pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed. Occasionally, landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway, to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal, reducing taxi times.|$|E

Once <b>departing</b> <b>aircraft</b> are [...] away from the airport, responsibility is taken over by Oslo Air Traffic Control Center, which supervises the airspace with Hauk√•sen Radar. There are two ground radars at the airport, located on the far sides {{of each of the}} runways. Both at the gates and along the taxiways, there is an automatic system of lights that guide the aircraft. On the tarmac, these are steered by the radar, while they are controlled by motion sensors at the gate.|$|E
