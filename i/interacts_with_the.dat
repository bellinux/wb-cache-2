5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> stellar wind. As the wind {{moves away from the}} star its rate of angular velocity slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wind, which applies a drag to the stellar rotation. As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the star to the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E

In conjunction with rapid freezing techniques, electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport, for instance in demonstrating that exocytotic vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses.|$|E
50|$|Although CoA binds at {{the same}} site as ATP, they bind in {{distinct}} orientations, and their adenine moieties <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> enzyme <b>with</b> nonoverlapping sets of residues. His-177, Phe-247, and Arg-106 are necessary for CoA recognition but not for ATP, and while Asn-43 and His-307 <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> adenine base of ATP, His-177 and Phe-247 <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> adenine base of CoA. Both molecules use Lys-101 to neutralize the charge on their respective phosphodiesters.|$|R

5|$|Drowned God uses a point-and-click {{interface}} {{and first}} person perspective typical of games similar to Myst of the mid- to late-1990s. The player navigates and <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game world by clicking the mouse on {{different parts of}} the screen. The mouse cursor changes shape depending on the action clicking will perform: an arrow for moving to another location, a face with an arrow to pick up or place Tarot cards, and an Eye of Providence for activating or interacting with objects in the environment. Frequent cutscenes provide background information and advance the storyline.|$|E
5|$|In the free-electron laser (FEL), a {{relativistic}} {{electron beam}} passes through a pair of undulators that contain arrays of dipole magnets whose fields point in alternating directions. The electrons emit synchrotron radiation that coherently <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same electrons to strongly amplify the radiation field at the resonance frequency. FEL can emit a coherent high-brilliance electromagnetic radiation {{with a wide range}} of frequencies, from microwaves to soft X-rays.

5|$|Jupiter's {{extensive}} magnetosphere envelops its {{ring system}} and the orbits of all four Galilean satellites. Orbiting near the magnetic equator, these bodies serve as sources and sinks of magnetospheric plasma, while energetic particles from the magnetosphere alter their surfaces. The particles sputter off material from the surfaces and create chemical changes via radiolysis. The plasma's co-rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries. In addition, the large internal magnetic fields of the moons contribute to the Jovian magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The Portopia Serial Murder Incident {{follows a}} first-person {{perspective}} and narrative. The various events are described with still pictures and text messages. The player <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game using a verb-noun parser which requires typing precise commands with the keyboard. Finding the exact words to type is {{considered part of}} the riddles that must be solved. While sound effects are present, the game lacks music and a save function. It features a conversation system with branching dialogue choices, where the story develops through entering commands and receiving answers to them from the player's sidekick or non-player characters.|$|E
5|$|These {{muscles are}} {{involved}} in moving and manipulating the tongue. The left and right genioglossus muscles in particular are responsible for protruding the tongue. The muscles, attached to {{the underside of the}} top and back parts of the tongue, cause the tongue to protrude and deviate towards the opposite side. The hypoglossal nerve also supplies movements including clearing the mouth of saliva and other involuntary activities. The hypoglossal nucleus <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reticular formation, involved in the control of several reflexive or automatic motions, and several corticonuclear originating fibers supply innervation aiding in unconscious movements relating to speech and articulation.|$|E

5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.|$|E
5|$|D {{departs from}} {{traditional}} wargaming and assigns each player a specific character to play {{instead of a}} military formation. These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master serves as the game's referee and storyteller while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and {{playing the role of}} the inhabitants. The characters form a party that <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> setting's inhabitants, and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process the characters earn experience points in order to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of sessions.|$|E
5|$|Glucocorticoids {{are under}} the {{regulatory}} influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone released into the bloodstream by the anterior pituitary. In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated {{by the presence of}} corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus. ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes. The HPA axis {{is an example of a}} negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis. The HPA axis also <b>interacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.|$|E
