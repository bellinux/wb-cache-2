40|$|Like other European {{national}} languages, Italian {{is rapidly}} losing prestige {{in favor of}} English, both in national and international scientific communication. Clear signs of this declining status can be noted in particular in national and international scientific literature (research papers, editorials, etc.) in terms of language policy and usage. This paper will discuss: i) the growing impact of written texts and active biliteracy in science; ii) the meaning and the general implications of the changing language policies of Italian scientific journals; iii) diglossia in scientific communication. This particular type of diglossia has already been mentioned by many researchers {{and it will be}} compared here to the classical and the broader meaning of the notion of diglossia. Such a comparison aims to understand whether it is appropriate to apply the label of “diglossia” also to this specific type of functional compartmentalization of codes. The crucial role of biliteracy will be examined within the Italian context, which will also be compared to the Swedish one. This study concludes that, despite significant differences in the progress rate of their status loss, national languages such as Italian (and the languages of other <b>European</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>communities)</b> seem to witness major language displacements in favor of English in science, higher education and other élite domains...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} polycentricity has gained {{significance}} in discussions on spatial development in Europe in recent years. This paper presents new evidence on polycentric city networks in Central-Eastern Europe based on selected {{results of the}} ESPON project POLYCE (Metropolisation and Polycentric Development in Central Europe). The authors discuss existing applications of the concept {{in the context of}} EU spatial policies and present an exploratory analysis of relational polycentricity focused on international networks of firms and research co-operation between seven capital cities in Central-Eastern Europe (Vienna, Bratislava, Prague, Warsaw, Berlin, Budapest and Ljubljana). Analysis of networks of firms in the advanced producer service sector reveals strong ties between Budapest, Prague, Vienna and Warsaw, with Berlin being less connected but hosting firm subsidiaries of higher order. The investigations on research networks within EU Research Framework Programmes demonstrate that Berlin and Vienna play dominant roles in research co-operation within the region and are also well integrated in <b>European</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>communities.</b> There is no clear indication that inter-urban firm and research networks are influenced by travel times or ethnic ties between the cities, but the similar structures of firm and research relations suggest that different kinds of interactions, networks and co-operation between cities often go hand in hand with each other and are connected in some way...|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{international}} efforts to develop transmutation technology, including the U. S., Russian, and <b>European</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>communities,</b> have determined that lead bismuth eutectic (LBE) is a potential material {{for use as a}} both a spallation target and a coolant. To exploit this potential, a more thorough understanding of the effect and rates of corrosion on steels, particularly non-Russian alloys, inside the LBE systems is required. Properly controlling the oxygen content in LBE systems has been observed to drastically reduce the corrosion of structural steels in LBE. However, the transport of oxygen and formation of corrosion products is not well understood; thus, their interaction, variation, corrosion, and precipitation along the flow path requires further characterization. The UNLV researchers have broken down their effort into three phases. Phase I simulates the corrosion process and phenomena occurring at the tube walls for a number of loop conditions. Phase II numerically simulates the effect of corrosion on components placed in the loop at predetermined ports. Phase III involves experimental testing of Phase II objectives. The experimental data acquired regarding corrosion effects will be compared with numerical simulations and used to benchmark the models. Variables to be analyzed include the distribution of LBE stream velocity, temperature, oxygen, and corrosion product concentrations close to the substrate. This will support the calculation of corrosion and precipitation rates in the entire system...|$|R

40|$|The EGI Federated Cloud is a standards-based, {{open cloud}} {{system as well}} as its {{enabling}} technologies that federates institutional clouds to offer a scalable computing platform for data and/or compute driven applications and services. The EGI Federated Cloud is based on open standards and open source Cloud Management Frameworks and offers to its users IaaS, PaaS and SaaS capabilities and interfaces tuned towards the needs of users in research and education. The federation enables scientific data, workloads, simulations and services to span across multiple administrative locations, allowing researchers and educators to access and exploit the distributed resources as an integrated system. The EGI Federated Cloud collaboration established a user support model and a training infrastructure to raise visibility of this service within <b>European</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>communities</b> with the overarching goal to increase adoption and, ultimately increase the usage of e-infrastructures {{for the benefit of the}} whole European Research Area. The paper describes this scalable user support and training infrastructure models. The training infrastructure is built on top of the production sites to reduce costs and increase its sustainability. Appropriate design solutions were implemented to reduce the security risks due to the cohabitation of production and training resources on the same sites. The EGI Federated Cloud educational program foresees different kind of training events from basic tutorials to spread the knowledge of this new infrastructure to events devoted to specific scientific disciplines teaching how to use tools already integrated in the infrastructure with the assistance of experts identified in the EGI community. The main success metric of this educational program is the number of researchers willing to try the Federated Cloud, which are steered into the EGI world by the EGI Federated Cloud Support Team through a formal process that brings them from the initial tests to fully exploit the production resources. © 2015 IEEE...|$|R
