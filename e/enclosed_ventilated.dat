50|$|Newfoundland and Labrador banned smoking within {{public places}} such as day cares, schools, taxis, hospitals, retail stores, and {{recreational}} facilities in 1994. From 1994 to 2002 public places, such as food establishments, bars and bingo halls, and workplaces could allow smoking in designated smoking areas or rooms. In 2002, through {{an amendment to the}} Smoke-free Environment Act, smoking was banned in food establishments, shopping malls, transportation terminals, hotel/motel common areas, games arcades, public libraries and boys and girls clubs. In 2005, smoking was banned in all public spaces and workplaces, under the province's Smoke-Free Environment Act, including licensed liquor establishments and bingo halls. <b>Enclosed,</b> <b>ventilated</b> smoking rooms are permitted only in psychiatric facilities and long term care facilities. Sales of tobacco are prohibited in {{places such as}} in retail stores that have a pharmacy, on university and college campuses, or recreational facilities. Smoking in a motor vehicle, when a person under the age of 16 is present, became illegal in 2011.|$|E

50|$|In 1916, the station's {{generating}} {{equipment was}} replaced by a 3,000 kW Parsons generating set. This was the first generating set in the world to use reheated steam between stages in its turbines, and to progressively heat feed-water using partially expanded steam. In 1919 the station was further modified, becoming the first station in the world to use an <b>enclosed</b> <b>ventilating</b> circuit for the alternator with a gilled-tube cooler for extracting the heat from the ventilating air, which overcame problems caused by dust and moisture getting into the windings. When the UK's national grid distribution system was brought into use in 1932, the station was one of a small number of stations in the region to be converted from the 40 hertz (Hz) frequency used by the North Eastern grid system to the 50 Hz frequency used by the national system. The station ceased operating in 1959. Reclamation of the coke works began in the 1970s and the area has now been returned to grassland. An electrical substation still stands near the site.|$|R

40|$|The {{heat from}} the sun, coupled with the wind, {{has been used to}} dry and {{preserve}} food crops for several thousand years. Some crops, such as Chili, Bananas, Coffee Beans, timber, need to be dried before they can be used effectively. Sun drying has often developed into solar drying, where drying occurs is in an <b>enclosed,</b> <b>ventilated</b> area–often using polythene, acrylic or glass covering. Present work deals with design, fabrication of double flow solar dryer. Double flow solar air heater is the advanced modification of single flow solar air heater. In the single flow solar air heater, air flows through one side of copper plate whereas in the double flow solar air heater air flow from both side of copper plate and hence more efficient than any other kind of solar air heater...|$|E

40|$|The home serves many {{purposes}} {{besides a}} place of residency. The home is where we begin and finish our day, where families and their children live, play, and grow for years, and where people {{have a sense of}} comfort and safety. Unfortunately, the home is a place where many known and unknown environmental toxins cause health hazards that affect residents on a daily basis. Indoor environmental hazards in the home harm millions of children and families each year. Scientists have long recognized that indoor toxic hazards can pose far greater risks to children’s health than outdoor exposures because of the concentrated levels in <b>enclosed,</b> poorly <b>ventilated</b> spaces. The following report outlines the initial efforts of a collaborative effort to develop an initial blueprint to adequately respond to these challenges in Chicago and Cook County. Participants include representatives from local, county, state, and federal agencies; community groups, private industry, and academia; and public health, housing, and child advocates. Implementing this blueprint will help to ensure that our children and families have homes that support good health and good living...|$|R
40|$|The harsh {{environment}} of the arctic requires specialized safety solutions. One main safety issue in the arctic {{is the need for}} more enclosed modules. Enclosed modules are used for two reasons; to prevent ice and snow to expose the process equipment; and to prevent the cold climate to impose an unduly harsh working environment for operators. The <b>enclosed</b> mechanically <b>ventilated</b> process modules are different from the open naturally ventilated process modules that are normally used in offshore facilities. The explosion safety performance of the non-standard mechanically ventilated process modules has therefore been studied in detail through an extensive program of CFD simulations. It is seen that mechanically ventilated modules has explosion risk drivers that are distinctly different from risk drivers in naturally ventilated modules. It is seen that the ignition source isolation efficiency is significantly more important for confined modules than for standard naturally ventilated modules. The explosion design loads are therefore strongly depending on the ignition source isolation efficiency. Isolation control, {{and its impact on the}} explosion design loads, is discussed in this paper. The presented conclusions are of high importance in future developments in arctic climate...|$|R
50|$|The Village Center {{opened on}} June 14, 1986. It was {{originally}} anchored by Valu Food, a local supermarket chain. After Valu Food {{went out of}} business, a Safeway opened in the Village Center in late 1999. The 40,000 sq ft Safeway store and a nearby Friendly's Restaurant were demolished in 2006 {{to make way for}} a new 56,000 sq ft Harris Teeter supermarket. The new Harris Teeter, the second in Maryland, opened in May 2008. In November 2011, the Corner Stable replaced Michael's Pub as the flagship restaurant in the village center. Michael's Pub, which had been located in the center since 1986, was unable to stay in business after it spent $200,000 to construct an <b>enclosed</b> and separately <b>ventilated</b> smoking area in its bar that complied with existing law, only to have Howard County thereafter prohibit smoking anywhere in bars.|$|R
40|$|More than {{a million}} workers {{are at risk for}} {{methylene}} chloride exposure. Aerosol sprays and paint stripping may also cause significant nonoccupational exposures. After methylene chloride inhalation, significant amounts of carbon monoxide are formed in vivo as a metabolic by-product. Poisoning predominantly affects the central nervous system and results from both carboxyhemoglobin formation and direct solvent-related narcosis. In this report, we describe a case of methylene chloride intoxication probably complicated by exogenous carbon monoxide exposure. The worker's presentation of intermittent headaches was consistent with both methylene chloride intoxication and carbon monoxide poisoning. The exposures and symptoms were corroborated by elevated carboxyhemoglobin saturations and a workplace inspection that documented significant exposures to both methylene chloride and carbon monoxide. When both carbon monoxide and methylene chloride are inhaled, additional carboxyhemoglobin formation is expected. Preventive efforts should include education, air monitoring, and periodic carboxyhemoglobin determinations. Methylene chloride should never be used in <b>enclosed</b> or poorly <b>ventilated</b> areas because of the well-documented dangers of loss of consciousness and death...|$|R
50|$|Post {{grouping}} in 1923, of the 282 {{million gallons}} of milk transported by rail by all four national railways companies, the GWR had the largest share of milk traffic, serving the rural and highly agricultural West of England and South Wales. From the 1880s, the milk was delivered direct from the farmer to the local railway station in milk churns. So to remove the need for moving unprocessed milk from one container to another, and hence potential cross contamination or need to install hygienic washing facilities, the decision was taken to transport the milk churns. From the 1880s, the GWR had introduced the GWR Siphon series of passenger carriage chassis-based high-speed and <b>ventilated</b> <b>enclosed</b> wagons, but with volumes rising and production systems changing, the transport system had to change. Introduced from 1926, Milk Tank Wagons were initially built on two-axle GWR chassis, and from 1936 on three-axle. The glass-lined tank which carried the milk was supplied and owned by the dairy firm. Typically weighing 25 LT when loaded with 3000 imp gal of milk product, it resulted in a wagon that was as heavy as an express passenger coach. Formed into specialised milk trains, to reduce time delays to market they were hauled by topline express locomotives, including Kings, Castles and Halls, unlike the similarly heavy coal trains.|$|R
40|$|Summary To {{study the}} effects of {{elevated}} CO 2 on gas ex-change, nonstructural carbohydrate and nutrient concentra-tions in current-year foliage of 30 -year-old Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees, branches were <b>enclosed</b> in <b>ventilated,</b> transparent plastic bags and flushed with ambient air (mean 370 mmol CO 2 mol- 1; control) or ambient air + 340 mmol CO 2 mol- 1 (elevated CO 2) during two growing sea-sons. One branch bag was installed on each of 24 selected trees from control and fertilized plots. To reduce the effect of vari-ation among trees, results from each treated branch were com-pared with those from a control branch on the same whorl of the same tree. Elevated CO 2 increased rates of light-saturated photosynthesis on average by 55 % when measured at the treatment CO 2 concentration. The increase was larger in shoots with high needle nitrogen concentrations than in shoots with low needle nitrogen concentrations. However, shoots grown in elevated CO 2 showed a decrease in photosynthetic capacity compared with shoots grown in ambient CO 2. When measured at the internal CO 2 concentration of 200 mmol CO 2 mol- 1, photosynthetic rates of branches in the elevated CO 2 treatments were reduced by 8 to 32 %. The elevated CO 2 treatment caused a 9 to 20 % reduction in carboxylation efficiency and an 18 % increase in respiration rates. In response to elevated CO 2, starch, fructose and glucose concentrations in the needles increased on average 33 %, whereas concentrations of potas-sium, nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium and boron decreased. Needle nitrogen concentrations explained 50 [...] 60 % of the vari-ation in photosynthesis and CO 2 acclimation was greater at low nitrogen concentrations than at high nitrogen concentrations. We conclude that the enhanced photosynthetic rates found in shoots exposed to elevated CO 2 increased carbohydrate con-centrations, which may have a negative feedback on the pho-tosynthetic apparatus and stimulate cyanide-resistant respiration. We also infer that the decrease in nutrient concentrations of needles exposed to elevated CO 2 was the result of retransloca-tion of nutrients {{to other parts of the}} branch or tree...|$|R
40|$|The tectonic {{opening of}} Fram Strait during the Neogene was a {{significant}} geological event that transferred the Arctic Ocean from a poorly <b>ventilated</b> <b>enclosed</b> basin, with weak exchange with the North Atlantic, to a fully ventilated &#x 201 C;ocean stage&#x 201 D;. Previous tectonic and physical oceanographic analyses suggest that the early Miocene Fram Strait was likely several times narrower and less than half as deep as the present-day 400 km wide and 2550 m deep strait. Here we use an ocean general circulation model with a passive age tracer included to further address {{the effect of the}} Fram Strait opening on the early Miocene Arctic Ocean circulation. The model tracer age exhibits strong spatial gradient between the two major Arctic Ocean deep basins: the Eurasian and Amerasian basins. There is a two-layer stratification and the exchange flow through Fram Strait shows a bi-layer structure with a low salinity outflow from the Arctic confined to a relatively thin upper layer and a saline inflow from the North Atlantic below. Our study suggests that although Fram Strait was significantly narrower and shallower during early Miocene, and the ventilation mechanism quite different in our model, the estimated ventilation rates are comparable to the chemical tracer estimates in the present-day Arctic Ocean. Since we achieved ventilation of the Arctic Ocean with a prescribed Fram Strait width of 100 km and sill depth of 1000 m, ventilation may have preceded the timing of a full ocean depth connection between the Arctic Ocean and North Atlantic established through seafloor spreading and the development of the Lena Trough...|$|R
