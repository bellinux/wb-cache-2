5|$|Marie Krøyer (1867–1940) {{came from}} an {{affluent}} German family who had moved to Copenhagen. From an early age she aspired to become an artist and after private training she went to study in Paris where Krøyer began to court her. It is believed Marie was subsequently reluctant to paint as she looked up to Krøyer as a far more accomplished artist. A <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> works have nevertheless survived.|$|E
5|$|Names {{of three}} poets from the 11th century {{and some of}} their poems are available. Madara Chennaiah, a cobbler turned saint, is {{considered}} by H.S. Shiva Prakash as the first Vachana poet, and was held in high esteem by latter day poets of the 12th century, including Basavanna. Only ten of Chennaiah's poems, expressing his resentment of the caste system in metaphors taken from the cobblers' trade, are extant today. Dohara Kakkaiah is the second poet. A dalit by birth, his six available poems are confessional in nature, a theme seen in the later poems of Basavanna. Devara Dasimaiah (or Jedara Dasimaiah, 1040) is better known because a hundred and fifty of his poems are available. Written in a deft and concise language of proverbs and metaphors, his poems encourage monotheistic belief in the god Shiva. Dasimaiah's wife Duggale qualifies as Kannada's first women poet, though only a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> poems are available.|$|E

25|$|Developing a {{reliable}} account of Blavatsky's life has proved difficult for biographers because {{in later life}} she deliberately provided contradictory accounts and falsifications about her own past. Further, very <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own writings authored prior to 1873 survive, meaning that biographers must rely heavily on these unreliable later accounts. The accounts of her early life provided by her family members have also been considered dubious by biographers.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{specific}} venue, the show begins with a performance from opening act Karyn Rochelle. The stage consists of a large cube video monitor, featuring four sides showing Brooks' logo prior to the concert beginning. At the start, the cube is raised and Brooks appears as the first song is played. He begins his set, performing nearly all popular songs from his early albums. Yearwood then accompanies Brooks for a duet, followed by performing a select <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> songs. Brooks returns to perform additional songs, then two separate sets of encores.|$|E

25|$|Though {{never the}} author of a major book, Rahel Varnhagen is remembered both for the {{intensity}} and variety of her correspondence. Six thousand letters have survived, out of an estimated ten thousand letters written by her in the course of her lifetime. A <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> essays were published in Das Morgenblatt, Das Schweizerische Museum, and Der Gesellschafter; in 1830, her Denkblätter einer Berlinerin was published in Berlin. Her husband, Karl August, edited and published her correspondence in the twenty years following her death. Her correspondence with David Veit and with Karl August was published in Leipzig, in 1861 and 1874–1875 respectively.|$|E
25|$|Henry III {{took pride}} in resolving the Gascon crisis so decisively, but his English {{subjects}} feared that the marriage would bring Eleanor's kinfolk and countrymen to live off Henry's ruinous generosity. A <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> relatives did come to England soon after her marriage. She {{was too young to}} stop them or prevent Henry III from supporting them, but she was blamed anyway and her marriage soon became unpopular. Interestingly enough, Eleanor's mother had been spurned in marriage by Henry III and her great-grandmother, Alys of France, Countess of Vexin, had been spurned in marriage by Richard I of England.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{officers}} on Owen Glendower during her time with the West Africa Squadron was Cheesman Henry Binstead. He served as an Admiralty Midshipman and later as an acting Lieutenant. He is most noted for the diaries that he kept, which detail life on the squadron. They record frustrations, slave ships chased and captured, fears of attack and imprisonment, impressions of the indigenous African people, and effects of ill-health and fever on the ship’s men. When Owen Glendower finally returned to England, Binstead {{was one of the}} <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> original crew to have survived.|$|E

25|$|Contributing {{poems and}} stories {{of power and}} grace to the leading magazines, Harper's Magazine, The Atlantic, The Galaxy, the first Scribner's, she also {{published}} a half-dozen very successful books for children, Bedtime Stories, Firelight Stories, Stories Told at Twilight, and others that were considered popular in their day. She collected a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> many adult tales into volumes, Miss Eyre of Boston and Some Women's Hearts. It is in Boston that she did {{the greater part of}} her work, including her books of travel, Random Rambles and Lazy Tours, published her four volumes of poetry, and edited and prefaced biographies, A Last Harvest and Garden Secrets, and the Collected Poems of Philip Bourke Marston, as well as a selection from Arthur O'Shaughnessy's verses.|$|E
25|$|Newhall {{subsequently}} {{wrote the}} book The Eppleton Hall which {{tells the story of}} the discovery and restoration of the ship, the events surrounding Reliant, and the eleven thousand mile journey from the Tyne to San Francisco. The route chosen was determined by the tug's conversion to diesel firing with the resultant limited fuel capacity and her low overall power output. Sailing via Dover, Lisbon, Cape Verde, Georgetown, via Panama and San Diego to name but a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> scheduled stops; not counting running out of fuel in the Bay of Biscay, vacuum pump failure in mid Atlantic, rescuing a fishing vessel off the coast of Mexico, and nearly foundering in a storm out of San Diego on the final leg to San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|Many {{lifeboats}} overturned while loading or lowering, spilling passengers {{into the}} sea; others were overturned by the ship's motion {{when they hit}} the water. It has been claimed that some boats, because of the negligence of some officers, crashed down onto the deck, crushing other passengers, and sliding down towards the bridge. This has been disputed by passenger and crew testimony. Some crewmen would lose their grip on ropes used to lower the lifeboats while trying to lower the boats into the ocean, and this caused the passengers to spill into the sea. Others tipped on launch as some panicking people jumped into the boat. Lusitania had 48 lifeboats, more than enough for all the crew and passengers, but only six were successfully lowered, all from the starboard side. Lifeboat 1 overturned as it was being lowered, spilling its original occupants into the sea, but it managed to right itself shortly afterwards and was later filled with people from in the water. Lifeboats 9 and 11 managed to reach the water safely with a few people, but both later picked up many swimmers. Lifeboats 13 and 15 also safely reached the water, each overloaded with around 70 people. Finally, Lifeboat 21 reached the water safely and cleared the ship moments before her final plunge. A <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> collapsible lifeboats washed off her decks as she sank and provided floatation for some survivors.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the periods of mental illness Krøyer {{experienced}} from 1900, the marriage fell apart. In 1912, she married Hugo Alfvén who had also been taken by her beauty.

500|$|Bonstelle had a wide reputation; {{according}} to Brooks Atkinson her [...] "industry {{in the theater}} [...] famous throughout Eastern America". However, Broadway critics did not rate her directing highly.

He also said that Thatcher [...] "broke the mould" [...] in everything she had achieved in her life, {{and that she had}} had the ability to [...] "overcome every obstacle in her path".

500|$|In {{the late}} 1850s, the Dickinsons befriended Samuel Bowles, {{the owner and}} {{editor-in-chief}} of the Springfield Republican, and his wife, Mary. They visited the Dickinsons regularly for years to come. During this time Emily sent him over three dozen letters and nearly fifty poems. Their friendship brought out some of her most intense writing and Bowles published a <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> poems in his journal. It was from 1858 to 1861 that Dickinson {{is believed to have}} written a trio of letters that have been called [...] "The Master Letters". These three letters, drafted to an unknown man simply referred to as [...] "Master", continue to be the subject of speculation and contention amongst scholars.|$|E
500|$|As {{the mid-1990s}} {{included}} adaptations of four Austen novels, there were <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> works to adapt. Andrew Higson argues that {{this resulted in}} a [...] "variety of successors" [...] in the genres of romantic comedy and costume drama, as well as with films featuring strong female characters. Cited examples include Mrs Dalloway (1997), Mrs. Brown (1997), Shakespeare in Love (1998), and Bridget Jones's Diary (2001). In 2008, Andrew Davies, the screenwriter of Pride and Prejudice, adapted Sense and Sensibility for television. As a reaction to what he said was Lee's overly [...] "sentimental" [...] film, this production features events found in the novel but excluded from Thompson's screenplay, such as Willoughby's seduction of Eliza and his duel with Brandon. It also features actors closer to the ages in the source material.|$|E
