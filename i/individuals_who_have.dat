5|$|Supportive {{therapy and}} diaphragmatic {{breathing}} has shown to cause improvement in 56% of cases, and total cessation of symptoms in an additional 30% {{in one study}} of 54 adolescent patients who were followed up 10 months after initial treatments.

The technique is not used with infants or young children due to the complex timing and concentration required for it to be successful.

5|$|While the Slaying of Goliath is a {{relatively}} simple composition with the two protagonists centrally placed and the only other figures being dimly seen observers, the Brazen Serpent picture is crowded with figures and separate incidents as the various <b>individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been attacked by snakes struggle and die or turn toward the icon that will save them.

5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. <b>Individuals</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
