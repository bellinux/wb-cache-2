50|$|It {{is often}} said that damages ex contractu will lie for nonfeasance, {{misfeasance}} and malfeasance; whereas damages <b>ex</b> <b>delicto</b> will only lie for misfeasance and malfeasance.|$|E
5000|$|Ex contractu, Latin for [...] "from a contract," [...] is a {{legal term}} that {{indicates}} a consequence of a contract. Ex contractu is often to denote {{the source of a}} legal action (often as opposed to <b>ex</b> <b>delicto).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Reasoning that, Previously (1st appeal), it was {{the opinion}} that the {{complaint}} stated a cause of action ex contractu of contract and not <b>ex</b> <b>delicto</b> of tort. Governed by a different rule of damages, the previous case rules {{on the question of}} damages.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ex</b> <b>delicto,</b> Latin for [...] "from a wrong" [...] or [...] "from a transgression," [...] is a {{legal term}} that {{indicates}} a consequence of a tort, though the phrase can also refer to the consequence of a crime. This is often opposed to ex contractu.|$|E
50|$|The {{rule of law}} {{laid down}} is that an action in {{contract}} (ex contractu) will lie {{for any of the}} three. However, an action in tort (<b>ex</b> <b>delicto)</b> will lie only in misfeasance or malfeasance. The doctrine was formerly applied to certain callings carried on publicly.|$|E

For instance, the state of West Virginia reported that monetary loss for detention from business as an indirect result of the injury were not recoverable under an action for trespass vi et armis, but were available under the related action of trespass on the case, also known as an action <b>ex</b> <b>delicto</b> [...] "against the wrong." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{non-conformity}} to the Constitution (determined by {{a superior}} act of law) is not {{equivalent to the}} occurrence of illegality as a prerequisite of <b>ex</b> <b>delicto</b> liability. Normative illegality may specifically concern a precisely defined area for the binding force of a given regulation and not the whole period of the binding force of the normative act (this is clearly acknowledged by the so-called secondary non-constitutionality of the regulation resulting from the new Polish Constitution entering into force). The so-called legislative failure to act (the non-issuing of a normative act) is a specific form of normative illegality (art. 417 § 4). The interpretation of the prerequisites of such liability must respect {{one of the basic}} principles of a democratic state ruled by law i. e. the principle of separation and balance between the legislative, executive and judicial powers (Art. 10 Constitution). The interpretation of the term “legislative failure to act” may under no circumstance lead to independent stipulation, by the court examining a claim for damages, of the contents of the not adopted legal regulations. The broad view of <b>ex</b> <b>delicto</b> liability prerequisites, when referring to activities connected with the realisation of the public powers empire, should incline towards the far reaching consideration when interpreting and applying new mechanisms of liability. For it is very easy to cross the boundary in this respect, which may lead not only to overburdening public finances with unpredictable damages but even to the infringement of the principle of balance and division of powers within the state. Therefore, a lot will depend on rational and considerate judicial practice in this area. Additionally. the strong aspiration to maximize claimant’s protection must not lead to a certain threshold of rationalism being exceeded, since in a further perspective this would cause negative consequences to the claimants themselves and the whole society...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{begins with}} {{a brief history of}} the {{institute}} of compensation for damage until the birth of Victimology, moment when the victim came to occupy the center of scientific attention. Due to the evolving of the conceptions of Victimology, the compensation for the damage exerted a strong influence on many aspects of the criminal fact´s analysis. Thus, the study will examine the compensation in an overview of restorative justice, with special attention to the models of mediation and conciliation in order to repair the damage. Then the reparative model will be observed based on the State funds to repair the harm, moment when special attention will be given to Bill of Law of the Senate No. 269 of 2003, which aims to introduce the National Fund for Assistance to Victims of Violent Crimes (FUNAV). After this general analysis, it examines the model of repairing of damage adopted in Brazil, with particular emphasis on the civil action <b>ex</b> <b>delicto,</b> in the mold of Criminal Procedure Code...|$|E
40|$|The {{difficult}} {{genesis of}} European Tort Law pushes the Author {{to investigate whether}} the traditional damages reimbursement system {{is compatible with the}} legal discipline of family relations. Once described the two main doctrinal thesis dominating the landscape - one favorable to the applicability of the traditional reimbursement remedies of common civil law also to the family law sector; the other prone to the applicability of contractual liability - the Author carries out a deep investigation with respect to the objections opposed to the applicability of the <b>ex</b> <b>delicto</b> liability to family relations. On the basis of the most recent joint-chambres judgements of the Italian Supreme Court of Cassazione the Author finds a direct structural parallelism between illegal conducts within the family and the general paradigm of civil liability. In the perspective of a european common law of Torts, the Author recalls the fundamental enforcement role of the "de damno" liability once referred to non pecunuary damage...|$|E
40|$|García Amador, {{the first}} Special Rapporteur {{on the topic}} of state responsibility, was of the view that in {{international}} law, special circumstances denote situations of exemption from the secondary rule which attaches disadvantageous consequences to breach of obligation under any primary rule. By contrast, his successor, Roberto Ago, advanced the notion that the exceptional circumstances characterise situations of exemption from the obligations arising out of primary rules. In departure from both conceptions, James Crawford, the last Special Rapporteur on the law of state responsibility, submitted that it is only after having established that a certain course of behaviour is contrary to the terms of a prohibition that it becomes possible to enquire whether the actor had a justification for acting as he did. If affirmative, the conduct in question is to be regarded as conduct which neither conforms with the obligation nor constitutes a violation thereof. If negative, then the act amounts to an unjustified wrongdoing and accordingly forms the basis for the operation of the various disadvantageous consequences envisaged by the law of international responsibility. This contribution first examines the process of the development of the notion of exceptional circumstances in the edifice of the law of international responsibility <b>ex</b> <b>delicto.</b> It then shows that from the three competing conceptions, only that advanced by Ago proves capable of accurately accounting for the circumstances of consent, self-defence, and the legitimate application of a countermeasure. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The two law {{institutions}} {{specified in}} the title, so different as they are (i. e. provision of a contract between a possible wrongdoer and a person subject to damage, as well as liability insurance), have however one common characteristic: they both aim at {{the protection of the}} damage perpetrator against a diminution of his assets as result of indemnitary obligations. In short: they release the perpetrator from the liability incurred by the damage, they protect him against the "legal risk" consisting in the diminution of his assets by the amount due as indemnity. As regards the elimination of the liability for damages and the insurance of the liability, they both result in the exemption of the wrong-doer from a property sanction and find their justification in the principle of freedom of contract. However, this principle cannot lead to an exemption from liability for intentionally caused damage, as nullo pacto effici posse ne dolus praestatur. Therefore, neither the clause of non-liability nor the liability insurance might protect against the liability for wilful damage. It has been shown in the article that the non-liability clause (i. e. the clause excluding liability) can be applied not only to indemnitary relations ex contractu but also <b>ex</b> <b>delicto,</b> as testified, among others, by the contents of Art. 437 of the Civil Code. There is an essential difference between the clauses excluding liability and the clauses merely limiting liability. None the less, the legislator regulates jointly and uniformly the scope of application and of effectiveness of both these kinds of clauses. Thus they are both invalid by virtue of relevant provisions (e. g. Art 437 and Art. 558 § 2 of the C. C.; Art 160 and Art. 170 of the Maritime Code) and, moreover, by their being contrary to the principles of social coexixtence. The freedom of contract in exempting or limiting liabilities is restricted to the highest degree under legislation relating to planned contracts of socialist organisations, e. g. delivery and building contracts. One could say that these clauses are a legally admitted form of escape from the rigours and severities of individual liability conceived sometimes as a specific and severe risk inherent in economic activity. The application of these clauses contributes {{to the fact that the}} civil liability does not cover the totality of inflicted damages and does not cover the full amount of those taken into consideration and to be compensated. Though — from the point of view of the wrong-doer — the clause excluding liability and the liability insurance have an identical effect, they are actually in mutual opposition. In contra-distinction to the non-liability clause the liability insurance: a) does not deprive the injured person of the indemnity but guarantees its obtaining; b) does not release the perpetrator of the indemnity expenses but, on the contrary, ensures their payment in advance, namely in the form of insurance premiums. While the exemptive (i. e. excluding liability) clauses bring to light the necessity of extending the scope of persons' and goods' insurance, the limiting clauses favour the development of liability insurance: limitation and lumping (in one sum) of indemnities focilitate a proper evaluation of risks and the respective insurance protection.
