5|$|Together with Weldon Irvine, Simone turned Lorraine Hansberry's {{unfinished}} play To Be Young, <b>Gifted</b> <b>and</b> Black into a {{civil rights}} song. Hansberry had been a personal friend whom Simone credited with cultivating her social and political consciousness. She performed the song live on the album Black Gold (1970). A studio recording was released as a single, and renditions of the song have been recorded by Aretha Franklin (on her 1972 album Young, <b>Gifted</b> <b>and</b> Black) and by Donny Hathaway.|$|E
5|$|Mrs Rix Nicholas is very <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> {{she has her}} own {{individuality}} as an artist; but {{her personal}} outlook is not so much that of an artist with startling things to say... as of a healthy fellow-Australian who loves the familiar beauty of our landscape and delights in representing it in all its splendour and virility.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores syllabi and {{assignments}} {{from the}} teacher education program at the University of Iowa to determine whether required classes explicitly prepare future teachers to work effectively with talented <b>and</b> <b>gifted</b> students. A checklist is used {{to determine if the}} syllabi and assignments include the important topics in gifted education future teachers need to know to be satisfactory teachers of talented <b>and</b> <b>gifted</b> students. The syllabi and assignments looked at show a lack of information pertaining to talented <b>and</b> <b>gifted</b> students <b>and</b> <b>gifted</b> education in general. Preservice teachers leaving the teacher preparation program at the University of Iowa are expected to work with talented <b>and</b> <b>gifted</b> students in their future positions; however, those future teachers are not being educated on the best practices in gifted education. The findings conclude preservice teachers at the University of Iowa are not being prepared to work with talented <b>and</b> <b>gifted</b> students when they leave the teacher education program...|$|R

He {{also took a}} keen {{interest}} in mechanical things, particularly combustion engines, and was building Meccano models of aircraft and other vehicles by the age of 12. In his early teens, he became an avid amateur mechanic, fixing the family motor car and learning to drive. Marmaduke was never a hard worker and did not embark upon an academic career, but was considered to possess above average intelligence. In 1929, he passed the Junior Certificate Exam with first class honours. The certificate qualified him for Victoria Boy's High School from which he graduated in 1931.|$|E

5|$|Improvements {{in public}} schools were the {{hallmark}} of Carroll's term. Using money from a coal severance tax enacted by Ford's administration and increased revenue from an improving economy, Carroll increased teacher salaries and eliminated fees for required classes. He strengthened the Minimum Foundation Program and provided free textbooks. A School Building Authority was also created to help poor school districts construct new buildings. Vocational and special education were expanded, and a program for <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented students was piloted. Consequently, Kentucky improved in most national educational benchmarks, including moving from 46th to 38th nationally in teacher salaries.|$|E

5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for the government, {{industrial}} unrest was a persisting problem, particularly in the economically key states of New South Wales and Victoria. The opposition had become more potent as well: Scullin was widely recognised {{as one of the}} parliament's most <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> articulate members; even his opponents respected his personal probity. Scullin forecast that the Australian economy was highly vulnerable given its indebtedness, and was on a course for severe depression if government finances were not turned around dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Giovinco is a small, quick, {{technically}} <b>gifted,</b> <b>and</b> agile player, with noted dribbling skills, balance, acceleration, {{and excellent}} ball control; these characteristics {{allow him to}} beat opponents, hold up the ball {{with his back to}} goal or in tight spaces, and create space or chances for teammates, despite his lack of strong physical attributes. Although he is capable of scoring goals, he also possesses good link-up play as well as notable playmaking skills, and he is known for his vision, creativity, and his passing and striking ability with both feet, despite being naturally right footed, as well as his accuracy and ball delivery from free kicks. Giovinco is capable of playing in several offensive positions, and he is usually deployed in a free role as a second striker, although he is also capable of playing as a winger, on either flank, or in the centre as a creative attacking midfielder; he has also been used in a more offensive, central role as a main striker.|$|E

5|$|The 1979 general {{election}} brought a Conservative government {{to power and}} allowed the Council to shift its focus towards retaining Grammar Schools where they still existed and improving schools where work had been put on hold during the comprehensive debate; despite 90% of English councils adopting comprehensive education, Lincolnshire had retained its grammar schools. Although the County Council began discussing the abolition of them again in 1985, opposition from parents at a public consultation in 1987 resulted in the plans being dropped. With the question of its future resolved, Carre's applied for grant-maintained status in 1989; the Education Secretary approved the proposals and formally granted the status in September 1990. When grant-maintained status was abolished in 1999, Carre's became a Foundation School. Following a successful bid to the DfES, submitted in October 2002, the school was granted specialist Sports College status in 2003. An all-weather pitch was laid out in 2007, and a new technology building with a fitness suite opened in 2011. In 2009, Carre's became a specialist Science College and a lead school for <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented students. The school converted to Academy status in August 2011. In 2014, the governors announced their intention to bid for conversion to a multi-Academy trust and become a coeducational, selective school on a new site; in February 2015, Kesteven and Sleaford High School announced its intention to join the proposed trust, a moved welcomed by Carre's. Carre's officially {{became part of the}} Robert Carre Multi-Academy Trust on 1 September 2015; the schools continue to operate on their sites, sharing staff and facilities.|$|E
