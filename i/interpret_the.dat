5|$|Bangladesh {{interprets the}} {{self-determination}} clause in Article 1 as applying {{in the historical}} context of colonialism.

5|$|Bob Balaban as David Laughlin, Lacombe's {{assistant}} and English-French interpreter. They meet {{for the first}} time in the Sonoran Desert at the beginning of the film.

5|$|Both the {{building}} and the institute take their name primarily from Master Morya, a non-corporeal spiritual leader from whom Helena Roerich received guidance via automatic writing. A secondary source of the name was Roerich himself who was revered as a theosophist master, able to <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> wisdom of ancient gurus to modern man.|$|E
5|$|The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> Covenant as also {{requiring}} {{states to}} respect the academic freedom of staff and students, as this is vital for the educational process. It also considers corporal punishment in schools to be inconsistent with the Covenant's underlying principle of {{the dignity of the}} individual.|$|E
5|$|The {{work has}} been widely admired, but also {{described}} as grandly emotive, populist, and openly anti-modernist. Writers have praised the book for helping them understand and <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> landscape in which they lived.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> Mishnah <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> {{words of}} [...] {{to exclude from}} {{designation}} as a [...] "stubborn and rebellious son" [...] a boy who had a parent with any {{of a number of}} physical characteristics. <b>The</b> Mishnah <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> words [...] "then his father and his mother shall lay hold on him" [...] to exclude a boy if one of his parents had a hand or fingers cut off. <b>The</b> Mishnah <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> words [...] "and bring him out" [...] to exclude a boy who had a lame parent. <b>The</b> Mishnah <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> words [...] "and they shall say" [...] to exclude a boy who had a parent who could not speak. <b>The</b> Mishnah <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> words [...] "this our son" [...] to exclude a boy who had a blind parent. <b>The</b> Mishnah <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> words [...] "he will not obey our voice" [...] to exclude a boy who had a deaf parent.|$|R
5000|$|Woodburne <b>interprets</b> <b>the</b> first khanda of Kena Upanishad to be {{describing}} Brahman in {{a manner}} that [...] "faith" [...] is described in Christianity. In contrast, Shankara <b>interprets</b> <b>the</b> first khanda entirely as monistic.|$|R
50|$|Attackers can evade IDS by {{crafting}} packets {{in such a}} {{way that}} <b>the</b> end host <b>interprets</b> <b>the</b> attack payload correctly while <b>the</b> IDS either <b>interprets</b> <b>the</b> attack incorrectly or determines that the traffic is benign too quickly.|$|R
5|$|A {{reflection}} {{is said to}} be indexed {{when its}} Miller indices (or, more correctly, its reciprocal lattice vector components) have been identified from the known wavelength and the scattering angle 2θ. Such indexing gives the unit-cell parameters, the lengths and angles of the unit-cell, as well as its space group. Since Bragg's law does not <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> relative intensities of the reflections, however, it is generally inadequate to solve for the arrangement of atoms within the unit-cell; for that, a Fourier transform method must be carried out.|$|E
5|$|A seminal work by Adam Hardy (1995) {{examined}} the Karnataka temple-building tradition {{over a period}} of 700years, from the 7th century to the 13th century, and reviewed more than 200temples built by four dynasties; Badami Chalukya, Rashtrakuta, Western Chalukya and Hoysala. The study covered dravida and nagara style monuments and the differences between the dravida tradition in modern Karnataka and that of neighbouring Tamil Nadu and made it possible to <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> many architectural details {{as part of a larger}} scheme.|$|E
5|$|Another risk is {{autonomic}} dysreflexia (AD), a medical emergency involving dangerously high blood pressure. People {{at risk for}} AD can take medications to help prevent it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E
2500|$|Rav's disciples told Rabbi Abba that Rav <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> {{words of}} [...] "Blessed shall {{you be in}} the city," [...] to mean that your house would be near a synagogue. Rav <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> words, [...] "and blessed shall you be in the field," [...] to mean that your {{property}} would be near <b>the</b> city. Rav <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> words of [...] "Blessed shall you be when you come in," [...] to mean {{that you would not}} find your wife in doubt of being a niddah upon returning home from travels. And Rav <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> words, [...] "and blessed shall you be when you go out," [...] to mean that your children would be like you. Rabbi Abba replied that Rabbi Johanan <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> words of [...] "Blessed shall you be in the city," [...] to mean that the privy, not the synagogue, would be near at hand. Rabbi Johanan's interpretation was in accordance with his opinion that one receives reward for walking (some distance) to a synagogue. Rabbi Johanan <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> words, [...] "And blessed shall you be in the field," [...] to mean that your estate would be divided into three equal portions of cereals, olives, and vines.|$|R
2500|$|When {{local governments}} “increase” a local tax, voter {{approval}} is required under Proposition 218. [...] The California Legislature adopted a statute <b>interpreting</b> <b>the</b> term “increase” {{for purposes of}} Proposition 218 although the courts have final say in <b>interpreting</b> <b>the</b> applicable constitutional language.|$|R
30|$|BF conceived, designed, drafted, {{and revised}} the manuscript; {{contacted}} <b>the</b> authors; and <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> findings; BF, AGR, AMA, and PP executed <b>the</b> review, <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> findings, {{and contributed to}} the writing of the paper, tables, and figures. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.|$|R
5|$|Communication {{partners}} {{may also}} require training to notice and consistently <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> communication signals of a severely disabled individual, particularly {{because there is}} a danger that learned helplessness can be the result of repeated failure to communicate successfully. Parties may need assistance to avoid the directive communication style that can lead a child user of AAC not to develop a full range of communication skills such as initiating or taking the lead in conversation, using complex syntax, asking questions, making commands or adding new information.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> Sylvester sequence {{as the result of}} a greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions, that at each step chooses the smallest possible denominator that makes the partial sum of the series be less than one. Alternatively, the terms of the sequence after the first can be viewed as the denominators of the odd greedy expansion of 1/2.|$|E
5|$|Jamie Pearson was {{responsible}} for editing the episode. The sequence where Lucas rescues Harry and Ruth near the end were made in slow motion, because the producers felt it would add to the tension. The incidental music was composed by Paul Leonard-Morgan. The computer graphics on the episode were designed by Mark Doman. The producers ended up being receptive of both Morgan and Doman's work, because {{of their ability to}} help <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> story via the music, and computers, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Rabbi Eleazar <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> words [...] "with rigor (parech)" [...] in [...] to {{mean that}} Pharaoh lulled the Israelites into {{servitude}} [...] "with a tender mouth (peh rak)." [...] But Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> words to mean [...] "with rigorous work (perikah)." ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} reason for a failure of {{interpreting}} unknown Kanji compound. Three intermediate and advanced learners of Japanese {{as a second language}} read Japanese sentences which included Kanji compounds. After reading they explained the meaning of these sentences and <b>the</b> process of <b>interpreting</b> <b>the</b> meaning of the unknown 	Kanji compounds. The learner's reports concerning <b>the</b> way of <b>interpreting</b> <b>the</b> meaning showed that a particle is a helpful clue to understanding the structure of sentences and <b>interpreting</b> <b>the</b> meaning of the sentences, including unknown Kanji compounds...|$|R

5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea {{and did not}} preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities {{on the subject of}} God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how to <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E
5|$|Negroes are not {{barred from}} {{organized}} baseball by the commissioner {{and never have}} been in the 21years I have served. There is no rule in organized baseball prohibiting their participation and never has been to my knowledge. If Durocher, or if any other manager, or all of them, want to sign one, or twenty-five Negro players, it is all right with me. That is the business of the managers and the club owners. The business of the commissioner is to <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> rules of baseball, and to enforce them.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand's judiciary, {{headed by}} the Chief Justice, {{includes}} the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, the High Court, and subordinate courts. Judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence. This theoretically allows the judiciary to <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> law {{based solely on the}} legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions.|$|E

5|$|Nuthatches {{are very}} vocal, using an {{assortment}} of whistles, trills and calls. Their breeding songs tend to be simple and often identical to their contact calls but longer in duration. The red-breasted nuthatch, which coexists with the black-capped chickadee throughout much of its range, is {{able to understand the}} latter species' calls. The chickadee has subtle call variations that communicate information about the size and risk of potential predators. Many birds recognise the simple alarm calls produced by other species, but the red-breasted nuthatch is able to <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> chickadees' detailed variations and to respond appropriately.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, it {{is argued}} that {{evolutionary}} theory is circular reasoning, in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution is required to <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> evidence. An example of this is the claim that geological strata are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in. However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their position relative to other strata and by radiometric dating, and most strata were dated before the theory of evolution was formulated.|$|E
5|$|The Laue back {{reflection}} mode records X-rays scattered backwards {{from a broad}} spectrum source. This is useful if the sample is too thick for X-rays to transmit through it. The diffracting planes in the crystal are determined by knowing that the normal to the diffracting plane bisects the angle between the incident beam and the diffracted beam. A Greninger chart {{can be used to}} <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> {{back reflection}} Laue photograph.|$|E
500|$|India <b>interprets</b> <b>the</b> {{right of}} {{self-determination}} as applying [...] "only to the peoples under foreign domination" [...] {{and not to}} apply to peoples within sovereign nation-states. It also <b>interprets</b> <b>the</b> limitation of rights clause {{and the rights of}} equal opportunity in the workplace within the context of its constitution.|$|R
2500|$|When a local {{government}} “extends” a local tax, voter approval is required under Proposition 218.

[...] However, the courts have final say in <b>interpreting</b> <b>the</b> applicable constitutional language.|$|R
2500|$|Rabbi Judah <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> words [...] "you {{shall not}} respect persons in judgment" [...] in [...] to teach judges not to favor their friends, and Rabbi Eleazar <b>interpreted</b> <b>the</b> words to teach judges not {{to treat a}} {{litigant}} as a stranger, even if the litigant was the judge's enemy..|$|R
