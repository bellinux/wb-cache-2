His wisdom is clouded with the {{original}} sin. He lives in idleness; he paints his face; he makes his squaw labor for him, instead of laboring for her; he kills his brothers.

The spirit makes him find the untrodden paths, and do brave deeds, and love his children and his honor. It makes him meet his foe face to face, and if he is to die it gives him strength to die--a man. The spirit is what makes him different from the arrow, the canoe, the mountain, and all the birds and beasts. For it is born of the Great Spirit, the creator of all. Him you must worship.|$|E

40|$|The {{spread of}} Hymenoscyphus fraxineus has been causing great concern {{regarding}} {{the survival of}} European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) throughout Europe since the 1990 s. The disease was first recorded in Trentino (southern Alps, Italy) in 2012 and has spread throughout the mountain landscape, where ash trees are scattered in small and isolated stands in different valleys. The status of the disease was checked by monitoring the damage to natural regeneration and adult trees in 90 sites spread over the whole region. The survey confirmed the complete colonization by the pathogen of the whole investigated area, {{with high levels of}} damage to both young and adult ash trees. Regeneration (both seedlings and saplings) was observed to be affected by the fungus in 88 plots out of 90. Out of 4486 examined young European ashes, 2261 (50. 4 %) were affected and 789 (17. 6 %) were already dead. Ten of the 384 assayed <b>flowering</b> <b>ashes</b> (Fraxinus ornus) showed symptoms on branches and apical stems, similar to those observed for European ash. Isolation and molecular analysis proved the presence of the fungus on both symptomatic European and <b>flowering</b> <b>ashes.</b> The examined 386 adult trees showed different levels of damage, sometimes reaching more than 75 % of the crown. Some individual trees (42) growing close to severely damaged trees appeared fully healthy, which suggests the possible existence of some resistant/tolerant individuals in the examined populations...|$|R

5000|$|According to {{an article}} in a November 1932 {{magazine}} article in the journal Nature by Herbert Beardsley, [...] "...the male larvae of a white insect, {{about the size of}} a mosquito, built a cocoon of pure, shining wax. The tree that produces the white wax insect grows in the Chien-Chang Valley, and there, about march, one may see, on the limbs and branches, round, brown forms, which contain innumerable white insects. If they are allowed to remain where they are, they will eventually drop off in a dead mass, for the food is not right for them; but if they are transported to other kinds of plants, the females will lay their eggs, the larvae will thrive and the male larvae will construct their shining palaces, which yield a profit to the wax-farmers. So, late in March, the insects are tied up in a leaf of the wood oil tree, then placed in gourd like receptacles which are packed into two large bamboo baskets. Runners or porters lift the baskets on their shoulders, and, traveling entirely at night - for to submit the insects to the midday heat would cause the pupal stage to end too soon - traverse the rocky paths and lofty ascents of the Cze-Chuan Mountains to arrive finally at the farming districts. The baskets of insects are distributed to the farmers, who proceed at once to place the creatures upon the food plant, which is generally a species of <b>flowering</b> <b>ash</b> about five or six feet high. They are tied to the branches in small bags made of leaves, and holes are punched in the bags with a blunt needle so the adults may find their way out. When first emerging, the insects creep rapidly up to the leaves of the food plant, where they nestle for nearly two weeks. After this they begin to scatter and crawl along the branches. About the first of June, the females begin to lay their eggs, and the wax cocoons are formed in August in time completely coating every branch and stem. By the first of September the whole tree is literally covered with layers of pure white wax a quarter of an inch thick. The farmers then scrape the branches, and prepare the wax of the market." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{concentration}} of n-alkanes in the cuticular wax of plants {{can be used}} to estimate the composition of the diet selected by free-ranging animals. The aims of this study were to characterize the n-alkane profiles of developing leaves and evaluate the degree of chemical discrimination between six browsed broadleaf tree species: European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), <b>flowering</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus ornus L.), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.), hazel (Corylus avellana L.), mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia L.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L). The effect of the stage of development was examined by considering five different vegetative stages: dormant bud (DB), late bud (LB), young leaf (YL), mature leaf (ML) and senescing leaf (SL). Five samples per each vegetative stage and species, gathered in a mixed woodland of the Italian Eastern Alps between February and October, were analysed for their n-alkane concentrations (C 23 -C 36). The residual coefficient of variation was 15. 5 % on average for the individual n-alkanes considered. There were noticeable differences in individual and total n-alkanes content between species. In particular, C 27 was the predominant n-alkane in beech and C 33 was found in high proportions in the two species of Fraxinus; hazel and <b>flowering</b> <b>ash</b> had a higher total n-alkanes content than the overall mean, while the lowest values were found in hornbeam and beech. The n-alkane profile also underwent important changes during the vegetative development, with different extent and direction according to the species. In the three successive leaf stages, a tendency for a progressive increase in the longest chain homologues was observed. In any case, the young leaf stage differed most from the contiguous stages. Canonical discriminant analysis indicated that the n-alkane profile of buds and leaves were mathematically distinguishable and the chemical differences between species were persistent over the plant vegetative development...|$|E

40|$|The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, {{is known}} as an {{important}} agent of hardwood forest defoliation in the northern hemisphere. Field observations in Corsica showed that caterpillars did not attack three hardwood species: Olea europaea (olive), Fraxinus ornus (<b>flowering</b> <b>ash)</b> and Ficus carica (common fig). Bioassays were conducted in the laboratory to test the toxic and/or repellent effect of these tree species on gypsy moth caterpillars. Control species were oaks (Quercus ilex, pubescens and robur). Three larval instar groups were tested (L 1 -L 2, L 3 -L 4, and L 5 -L 6). The first group was tested in boxes on fresh cut leaves, the others directly on young trees, the caterpillars being maintained in insect-proof system. Larval nutrition and development were recorded every two days. The results confirm the observations made in Corsica: larvae on anti-feedant species did not molt to the next larval stage and died of starvation (leaves were not consumed). This confirms that the anti-feedant tree species had {{a negative impact on}} gypsy moth caterpillars. Incidentally, it was also observed that larval development could be negatively affected when host plants are water stressed.

40|$|Na području Republike Hrvatske uvriježena je praksa da se različiti, krajnje devastirani tereni poput kamenoloma, deponija, odlagališta, šljunčara, u smislu trajnog zelenog pokrova, biološki revitaliziraju crnim borom (Pinus nigra Mill.). Korištenje drugih vrsta šumskog drveća te njihova uporaba u revitalizaciji do sada je kod nas nedovoljno istraženo. U tu je svrhu, u jesen 2007. godine, osnovano pokusno polje za potrebe istraživanja biološke sanacije kamenoloma Očura II autohtonim vrstama drveća i grmlja. Izabrane vrste su crni jasen (Fraxinus ornus), gorski javor (Acer pseudoplata nus), crna topola (Populus nigra), vrbe (Salix sp.), te kalina (Ligustrum vul gare) i bodljikava veprina (Ruscus aculeatus). Podaci o preživljenju nakon dvije sezone evidentiranja ukazuju na bolju otpornost na presadnju i na prilagodbu novim uvjetima školovanih sadnica javora, jasena te vrba i topola od biljaka presađenih iz šume. Sadnice kaline iz rasadnika nisu pokazale sličnu karakteristiku ranije navedenih vrsta, kao ni sklonost određenom tipu tla. Najmanje je preživljenje sadnica iz šume prenešenih na šumsko tlo (68, 8 %), a najveće, također šum skih sadnica, ali na poljoprivrednom tlu (87, 5 %). Ukupno gledajući, može se uočiti kako sadnice iz rasadnika imaju visoko i približno isto preživljenje i na poljoprivrednom i na šumskom tlu (89, 2 – 89, 7 %), a veće je od preživljenja biljaka presađenih iz šume. Ono se kreće od 73, 8 % na šumskom, do 86, 3 % na poljoprivrednom tlu. Sveukupno preživljenje biljaka (izuzevši veprinu) od 85, 0 % vrlo je visoko i zadovoljavajuće te pokazuje šire mogućnosti odabira vrsta prilikom radova na biološkoj sanaciji pojedinih kamenoloma od do sada uvriježenih u praksi. Analizom visinskih klasa, za sve promatrane vrste utvrđen je pomak za 1 – 4 klase. Najveći visinski prirast (do 120 cm) imale su sadnice vrba i topola. Biological {{revitalisation}} {{of highly}} devastated {{areas such as}} querries, depots and landfills is in Croatia, in terms of permanent green coverage, usually conducted with Austrian black pine (Pinus nigra Mill.). Until now research of other forest tree species utilization and their usage within sanation process haven’t been conducted. With this objective, {{in the fall of}} 2007, test field for scientific needs was established for research of biological sanation of querry Očura II with autochtonous tree and schrub species. Basic aim of this trial was to determine the possibility of application of autochtonous tree and shrub species in querry revitalisation. Trial was established in the border part of Očura II querry on already technically improved terracce. On this terracce layer of wasterock from querry was deposed which acts as foundation. Trial was established in two repetitions which depend on the soil type (deposed agricultural or forest humus substrate (soil)). In every repetition seedlings from nursery and from surrounding forest stands were planted. Seven pedological profiles have been dug up and additional observations have been conducted with pedological sonde. For indentification of pioneer forest species which come by nature on Očura querry locality, it was necessary to study and to determine vegetation, floristic composition of forest edges, as well as areas inside of querry on which natural vegetation begun to appear. Selection of plants for extraction was conducted in forest stands, on the top border area of querry, which was planned for clearcut in the near future with the aim of sequent exploitation of querry. Selected species were <b>Flowering</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus ornus L.), Sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), Black poplar (Populus nigra L.), willows (Salix sp.), and European privet (Ligustrum vulgare L.). 546 plants od forest tree species was planted in total, which include 110 willows and poplar plants, 110 sycamore maple and 110 <b>flowering</b> <b>ash</b> plants and 216 bush species plants, which include 144 European privet and 72 Ruscus aculeatus plants. Selection of Ruscus aculeatus for this trial was based on preservation of individuall speciments of this endangered specie in the vicinity of it’s habitant which will be devastated by exploitation. The results of test field monitoring indicate very good survival success of young plants. Outplanted plants on the test field were in very good health condition, except Ruscus aculeatus, which was planted with the aim of protection. For now conclusions about success of plants regarding the soil type could not be made, but there is a correlation between survival of plants and their breeding. At the time of survival observation nursery seedlings had higher average survival rate then plants extracted from surrounding stands. There is no difference in survival rate between plants planted on agricultural and forest soil in first year (91, 2 – 91, 1 %) but after secund year there are differences (81, 8 % on forest soil, 87, 7 % on agricultural soil). Survival of Sycamore maple is in range from 72, 0 % to 93, 3 %. Sycamore plants which have been extracted from forest stands have the lowest survival rate while plants planted on forest soil have lower survival (72 %) then plants planted on agricultural soil (73, 7 %). Survival of sycamore nursery seedlings is satisfatory on both soil types and it ranges from 88, 0 to 93, 3 %. <b>Flowering</b> <b>ash</b> nursery seedlings have 100 % survival rate regardless of soil type, but survival of <b>Flowering</b> <b>ash</b> extracted from forest stands is different in relation to soil type. On agricultural soil this survival rate is satisfatory and amounts 93, 3 %, while plants on forest soil have 56 % survival rate. Survival rate of willows and poplars ranges from 90, 0 to 100 %. The best survival have plants which have been extracted from forest stands and been planted on forest soil, and plants from stands planted on agricultural soil have the lowest survival. Survival of nursery seedlings ranges from 92, 0 to 90, 0 %. Survival of Euro pean privet is in the range of 68, 8 to 87, 5 %. More successful are European privet plants planted on agricultural soil. The results of this research indicate that adequate species of autochtonous and pioneer forest trees and species have been selected for revitalisation of this querry, taking into account their ecological requirements and biological features...|$|E

The measurements were performed by means of 2 piezometers set up approximately perpendicularly to the river Sava, forming profile number 1 (Fig. 1). The results of these measurements (Fig. 2, 3) show a significant lowering of groundwater level in 2000. The reason is most likely the unfavorable rainfall amount and distribution during that year (Table 2). A much better situation was during 2001 when the minimal groundwater level was up to 2 meters and it was considered {{to be the result of}} a favorable amount of rainfall and its distribution during the year (Tables 2, 3). It was noticed that Carpinus betulus appears instead of <b>flowering</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus ornus), which is a good sign that generally the level {{of underground}} water is lowering. Also, the phenomenon that pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) gradually loses its natural regeneration capability also confirms the trend of lowering underground water level. If this trend continues, oak will be in a very near future naturally substituted by less valuable species, probably Turkey oak (Quercus cerris). If groundwater wells along the river Sava reach the vicinity of this area, which is a plan for the Belgrade city water supply, the trend of groundwater table lowering will be even more expressed and it will certainly endanger the existence of all valuable forest species in this area...|$|E
40|$|Pitomi kesten (Castanea sativa Mill.) je vrsta šumskog drveća koja u širem prostoru južne Europe, a tako i Hrvatske, ima izuzetnu gospodarsku, ali i ekološku vrijednost. Problematika sušenja kestena dovela je do zanemarivanja vrste i u gospodarskom i u istraživačkom smislu, no posebice fitocenološkom. Ovaj članak donosi rezultate višegodišnjih fitocenoloških istraživanja. Analizirani su originalni fitocenološki snimci sakupljeni s čitavog područja Hrvatske, s naglaskom na glavna područja rasprostiranja (Zrinska i Petrova gora, Medvednica). Utvrđena je i opisana nova asocijacija mezofilnih kestenovih šuma (Aposeri foetidae-Castanetum sativaeass. nova) koja se od već do sada poznatih i opisanih kestenovih šuma, osim u flornom sastavu, razlikuje i po glavnim ekološkim čimbenicima (klima, tlo i geomorfologija). Raščlanjena je na dvije subasocijacije:typicumiligustretosum vulgare, a svrstana u svezu ilirsko-dinarskih bukovih šumaAremonio-Fagion, podsvezuEpimedio-Fagenion. Gospodarenje je također odlučni čimbenik u formiranju kestenovih zajednica, njihovog opstanka i dugoročnog razvoja. Stoljetno obnavljanje kestenovih šuma čistim sječama rezultiralo je posebnom, široko rasprostranjenom i po flornom sastavu vrlo siromašnom varijantom Rubus hirtus, u okviru mezofilnih kestenovih šuma. This paper {{describes}} a new association of mesophilous sweet chestnut forests with odorous pig-salad (Aposeri foetidae-Castanetum sativaeass. nova) in Croatia. The association {{is the most}} frequently found at altitudes 200 – 400 m, which refers to sites at Zrinska and Petrova gora, or higher (up to 600 meters at Medvednica, Žumberak), in both cases in transitional positions between oak and beech or in the beech belt. It occurs on northern and eastern expositions and less steep slopes (up to 20 °), which distinguish it very good from the well known acidophilous sweet chestnut forests (Querco-Castanetum sativae), which occurs at southern and more steep slopes. The most common soil type in this community is luvisol, deep and very acid to light acid, depending on subassociation. It is characterized by considerably larger number of mesophilous species from beech forests than acidophilous and thermophilous species. Phytosociological releves were collected following the principles of standard Braun-Blanquet method. In Phytosociological Table 1 there are 20 relevés of the association Aposeri foetidae-Castanetum sativae. Sweet chestnut is frequently accompanied by beech and hornbeam in the tree layer. Oak is also frequent but without important and significant role that it plays in acidophilous chestnut forests. Sometimes there are cherry, lime-trees and <b>flowering</b> <b>ash</b> in the tree layer and often silver birch in the localities with more light related to chestnut decline. In the shrub layer, together with chestnut and beech, frequent and well developed are species from order Fagetalia and alliance Carpinion betuli: Corylus avellana, Carpinus betulus, Prunus avium, Crataegus monogyna, Acer campestre, Rosa arvensis and Viburnum opulus. The other group are species from the order Quercetalia pubescentis:Fraxinus ornus,Ligustrum vulgareand Sorbus torminalis, which occurs very frequent. The ground vegetation layer is very good developed and made from the mixture of mesophilous species from the order Fagetaliaand acidophilous species from the order Quercetalia roboris-petraeae. Frequent and abundant are only Rubus hirtusand Pteridium aquilinumwhich reflect the instability of the forest community. Important for the association and its characteristics species are Aposeris foetida,Circea lutetianaandGaleopsis tetrahit, which as mesophilous and skiophilous well describe assosiations character. Other species from the order Fagetaliaand the allianceCarpinion betuliare: Epimedium alpinum,Sanicula europaea,Symphytum tuberosum,Polygonatum multiflorum,Pulmonaria officinalis, Primula vulgaris,Viola reichenbachiana,Galium sylvaticum,Lonicera caprifolium,Carex sylvatica, Lamium orvala, and from the order Quercetalia roboris-petraeae:Gentiana asclepiadea,Veronica officinalis,Melampyrum pratense,Hieracium racemosum,Luzula luzuloides,Luzula pilosa. When the association is developed on the higher elevation, in the beech belt, spring aspect is expressed with a domination of theAnemone nemorosa,Dentaria bulbiferaandGalium odoratum. According to the Code of Phytocoenological Nomenclature (Weber et al. 2000), relevé No. 6 in the ninth column of Table 1 is the nomenclatural type. Two subassociations were identified: typicumandligustretosum. Aposeri foetidae-Castanetum sativaesubass. typicumsubass. nova hoc loc is negatively distinguished typical subassociation which growes on deep luvisols and on less steep slpoes (20 °). Shade-tolerant species such as Athyrium filix-femina, Dryopteris filix-mas and Circea lutetiana are dominant in abundance. This subassociation includes widely distributed, anthropogenic, poor in species number, variant Rubus hirtus. This community is very specific by its physiognomy which refers to pure chestnut stands. Shrub layer is also not developed and in the ground vegetation layer Rubus hirtuscovers often 75 % of the area. Interesting species is Hypericum androsaemum, rare in Croatian Flora, but it occurs frequently at this community. According to the Code of Phytocoenological Nomenclature (Weber et al. 2000), relevé No. 6 in the Table 1 is the nomenclatural type of the subassociation typicum. Aposeri foetidae-Castanetum sativaesubass. ligustretosum vulgarisubass. nova hoc locois more thermophilous subassociation, distinguished by differential species Ligustrum vulgare,Mellitys melissophyllum and Lathyrus niger. The subassociation is considering mixture of termophilous, acidophilous and mesophilous species rather rich in species number. It grows on less acid soils, often on carbonate substrates. According to the Code of Phytocoenological Nomenclature (Weber et al. 2000), relevé No. 12 in the Table 1 is the nomenclatural type of the subassociation ligustretosum. AssociationAposeri foetidae-Castanetum sativaeis classified to order Fagetalia Pawl. 1928, alliance of illyrian beech forests, Aremonio-Fagion (Horvat 1938) Törek et al. 1989, suballiance Epimedio-Fagenion Marinček i dr. 1993 which refers to mesophilous and subthermophilous collin forests of Ilirija. Characteristic (Epimedium alpinum,Geranium nodosum,Knautia drymeia,Vicia oroboides) and differential (Hacquetia epipactis,Heleborus odorus,Lonicera caprifolium,Primula vulgarisandRuscus hypoglossum) species of the suballiance are more frequent and abundant in the subassociationligustretosumthan in the typicum where shade-tolerant species playing the main role. Mesophilous chestnut forests Aposeri foetidae-Castanetum sativaeass. nova hoc loco represent the terminal phase of the chestnut forests in Croatia. Primary, it originates on deep and rich soils {{in most of the}} localities on Petrova and Zrinska gora, and secondary, from the association Epimedio-Carpinetum betuli, where chestnut occurs and become predominant because of the acidification processes in the soil (north-western Croatia, Moslavina, Slavonsko gorje). There are two possible directions of the degradation processes in these forests. First goes through the overexploitation, stamping and soil acidification to acidophilous chestnut forest. The other one, more important and present in whole range of Zrinska and Petrova gora, is exclusively conditioned by management system. A few generations after clear-cutting, mixed chestnut forest turn to chestnut monoculture with onlyRubus hirtusat the ground vegetation layer, which sometimes covers 100 % of the area...|$|E
5000|$|To {{signal the}} coming of summer {{and the return of}} real warmth, on Beltane (Bel's Fire), the May Day festival time, dances such as the 'Obby 'Oss dance festival at Padstow in Cornwall are held with the maypole as its focus point. The {{celebrations}} are tied to the promotion of fertility and a fruitful growing season with the 'Obby 'Oss dancing to the music through streets decked out in <b>flowers,</b> and sycamore, <b>ash</b> and maple boughs. Shortly after on 8 May, the ancient rites of Spring are celebrated with the Furry Dance procession to an ancient tune made famous in the song [...] "The Floral Dance" [...] through the streets of nearby Helston together with the mystery play Hal an Tow. Fertility festivals like this used to be celebrated all over Britain.|$|R
50|$|A {{species such}} as Fraxinus excelsior, the common ash of Europe, {{demonstrates}} one possible kind of variation. <b>Ash</b> <b>flowers</b> are wind-pollinated and lack petals and sepals. Structurally, the flowers may be bisexual, consisting of two stamens and an ovary, or may be male (staminate), lacking a functional ovary, or female (carpellate), lacking functional stamens. Different forms may occur on the same tree, or on different trees. The Asteraceae (sunflower family), with close to 22,000 species worldwide, have highly modified inflorescences made up of flowers (florets) collected together into tightly packed heads. Heads may have florets of one sexual morphology - all bisexual, all carpellate or all staminate (when they are called homogamous), or may have mixtures {{of two or more}} sexual forms (heterogamous). Thus goatsbeards (Tragopogon species) have heads of bisexual florets, like other members of the tribe Cichorieae, whereas marigolds (Calendula species) generally have heads with the outer florets bisexual and the inner florets staminate (male).|$|R
40|$|Common reed (Phragmites australis (Cav) Trin. ex Steud) at {{wetlands}} is {{a natural}} resource in Jiangsu Province, China. Proper application of common reed could supplement bioenergy feedstocks and encourage wetlands conservation in this area. In this study, common reed and soil samples from wetlands near to farm, coastline and for wastewater treatment were collected. Potential bioethanol yield was estimated based on biomass yield and bioethanol production, and a life cycle assessment (LCA) model was built to analyze environmental performance of common reed bioethanol. The dry biomass yield of common reed was {{in the range of}} 3. 8 - 36 Mg ha(- 1), and location was the significant factor on biomass yield. Soil pH and available N content had positive impacts on yields of biomass and bioethanol; higher glucan content was detected in stem than in leaf and <b>flower,</b> while <b>ash</b> and klason lignin contents were higher in leaf than in stem and flower. The results indicated that wetlands with high available N content were very suitable for common reed growth, and stem fraction was better than leaf for bioethanol production. Based on LCA model calculation, the net energy and ratio of energy efficiency were compatible to bioethanol from switchgrass and rice straw, and the greenhouse gases (GHG) emission intensity and eutrophication potential were 15 gCO(2,eq) MJ(- 1) and - 1. 1 gPO(4) (3 -) (eq) MJ(- 1). The results indicate that common reed is a sustainable and renewable resource for bioethanol production, especially those grown on wetlands near to farmland in Jiangsu Province, China.
