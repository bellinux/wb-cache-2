The flight test programme took 1,200 hours on 530 flights, European <b>Joint</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Authorities</b> certification was delivered on 26 February 1988.

50|$|UAVs will {{in future}} {{have to be}} {{equivalent}} to and as transparent as manned aircraft {{if they are to}} be allowed to fly in controlled airspace. The UK Civil <b>Aviation</b> <b>Authority</b> (CAA) has published its policy regarding the Operation of UAVs in Controlled Airspace, CAP722. This policy is being adopted around the world by other <b>Aviation</b> <b>Authorities</b> such as the Federal <b>Aviation</b> <b>Authority</b> (FAA), the <b>Joint</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Authority</b> (JAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Although this is still just policy, UAV airframe constructors and flight control system suppliers face major challenges in meeting the existing regulatory standards in terms of the systems carried on-board but there will be new requirements specific to UAVs, such as Sense & Avoid, which will add to the certification burden.|$|R
5|$|On 3 February 1997, {{the airline}} {{announced}} it had ordered six 134-seat Boeing 737-700 aircraft for NOK1.5 billion. These aircraft would be delivered in 1998, {{prior to the}} opening of the new airport at Gardermoen. In addition, the airline had an option for additional ten planes to be delivered after 2000. In 1997, Transwede started replacing its Fokker 100s with Boeing 737s. In May 1997, Braathens SAFE was criticized by the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association because it was using retired Braathens SAFE pilots to fly Transwede aircraft, due to Transwede not having certified pilots for their new Boeing 737-300. Braathens SAFE stated that this was within the rules of the Swedish Civil Aviation Administration and the <b>Joint</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Authorities.</b>|$|E
5|$|On April 9, 1994, {{the first}} 777, line number WA001, was rolled {{out in a}} series of 15 ceremonies held during the day to {{accommodate}} the 100,000 invited guests. The first flight took place on June 12, 1994, under the command of chief test pilot John E. Cashman. This marked the start of an 11-month flight test program that was more extensive than testing for any previous Boeing model. Nine aircraft fitted with General Electric, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce engines were flight tested at locations ranging from the desert airfield at Edwards Air Force Base in California to frigid conditions in Alaska, mainly Fairbanks International Airport. To satisfy ETOPS requirements, eight 180-minute single-engine test flights were performed. The first aircraft built was used by Boeing's nondestructive testing campaign from 1994 to 1996, and provided data for the -200ER and -300 programs. At the successful conclusion of flight testing, the 777 was awarded simultaneous airworthiness certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European <b>Joint</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Authorities</b> (JAA) on April 19, 1995.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Norway {{decided to}} allow any airline from the European Economic Area to operate {{helicopter}} services in Norway from 1995. This meant that companies like Bristow Group, KLM and Maersk Air could start operation in Norway. This would be coordinated through common technical rules for helicopters through the <b>Joint</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Authorities.</b> Braathens Helikopter and Helikopter Service announced on 1 October 1993 {{that the two}} companies would merge from 1 January 1994. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi would be paid NOK225 million in Helikopter Service shares. The Norwegian Competition Authority stated {{they would have to}} look at the merger, since the new company would have a near-monopoly on offshore flights. However, the Ministry of Transport and Communications stated that the authority could not hinder the merger, because by the time new contracts were awarded in 1995, helicopter operators from foreign countries would also be allowed to bid. The ownership of Braathens Helikopter was transferred to Helikopter Service on 14 December. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi received 14% of the shares in the merged company. They were immediately sold, giving Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi a NOK170 million profit on the five-year venture. Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi needed the capital to participate in an initial public offering of Braathens. Most of the management of Braathens Helikopter was hired at the newly established competitor United Helicopter, a joint venture between Bristow Helicopters, Leif Höegh & Co and Andreas Ugland & Sønn.|$|E

25|$|The UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} benefit of requiring upper torso restraints (UTR, i.e., shoulder harnesses) in passenger seats of aircraft weighing less than 5,670kg in response to a safety recommendation arising from the investigation of a 1999 accident involving a Cessna Titan near Glasgow. As a result of that study, the CAA changed its regulations to require shoulder harnesses for passengers on all aircraft registered after February 1, 1989, if that aircraft has a maximum takeoff weight of 5,700 or less and 9 passenger seats or fewer. The CAA also forwarded a recommendation to the <b>Joint</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Authorities</b> (JAA) of Europe, recommending that European regulators adopt a similar standard. However, {{at the time of the}} Loganair accident, the JAA had not acted on the recommendation. Although the UK regulation covered the accident aircraft (it was first certified in May, 1989), Loganair had obtained an exemption from the CAA concerning this issue.|$|E
25|$|In May 1989, {{one week}} before the initial {{delivery}} to the 747-400's first European customer, KLM, the <b>Joint</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Authorities</b> (JAA) shocked Boeing by refusing to grant regulatory certification for the aircraft, citing the upper deck cabin floor's resistance to collapse {{in the event of}} a sudden decompression. While the manufacturer asserted that the 747-400's cabin floor was no different from the already-certified and in-service 747-300, the JAA maintained that the newer model would have a service life into 2020 and beyond and was thus subject to a newer, more stringent standard which had been updated to reflect the risk of explosive devices. In the days leading up to the first delivery to KLM, negotiations between Boeing, the FAA, and the JAA resulted in a compromise: a temporary operating certificate would be issued for the 747-400, provided that the manufacturer develop a structural retrofit for the aircraft within two years. The last-minute deal allowed KLM and Lufthansa to take delivery of their 747-400s without further delays.|$|E

Weighing , including [...] of test equipment, the A330 became the biggest twinjet to have flown, until the later first {{flight of the}} Boeing 777. The flight lasted five hours and fifteen minutes during which speed, height, and other flight configurations were tested. Airbus intended the test flight programme to comprise six aircraft flying a total of 1,800 hours. On 21 October 1993, the Airbus A330 received the European <b>Joint</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Authorities</b> (JAA) and US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certifications simultaneously after 1,114 cumulative airborne test hours and 426 test flights.

500|$|The {{objective}} of regulation is to [...] "promote {{high standards of}} safety {{in all aspects of}} aviation", and this is the main area of interaction between the CAA and the GA sector. Efforts focus on assuring appropriate standards of airworthiness, pilot qualification, the rules for the movement of aircraft, and equipment to be carried. The CAA was established as the primary regulatory body for all aviation in the UK in 1972. In 1991 it started working within the <b>Joint</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Authorities</b> (JAA) framework to implement agreed common standards, known as the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR), throughout the European Union (EU). In 2003 this was taken a step further when the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was established as the central EU regulator, taking over responsibility for legislating airworthiness and environmental regulation from the national authorities. The CAA acts as an agency of EASA on these issues, retaining its original regulatory powers in areas not yet transferred to EASA. Proposed developments seek to establish EASA as the single authority throughout the EU, taking over from individual member states the power to regulate all aviation other than that specifically excluded from the scope of EASA.|$|E
