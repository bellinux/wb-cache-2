McMillin and Weaver {{did not have}} sufficient high-school credits to enter college and enrolled at Somerset High School for the 1916-17 year, playing with Red Roberts. [...] "I've got a boy under my wing <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Texas who's a football-playing fool and I {{want him to go}} to Centre.

2500|$|According to the temple's records, Nichiren first settled <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> 1253 {{and left}} for Minobu in 1272. Every year in August a special {{ceremony}} called [...] is held at the temple to commemorate the so-called [...] "Matsubagayatsu Persecution", an episode in which Nichiren had to hide from his persecutors in the forest near Nagoe, towards Zushi, and was fed with ginger by a white monkey. Not only does the temple claim to have {{the ruins of the}} hut in which he used to live, but the very path Nichiren is supposed to have taken to escape to Nagoe leaves the temple from above the hill behind the main hall.|$|E
2500|$|After {{assuming}} {{office in}} 1946, Morrison appointed Adair Watters [...] {{superintendent of the}} New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) {{in an effort to}} eliminate corruption. But tensions developed when Watters moved to suppress gambling, prostitution, and other vice too zealously for Morrison's liking. Watters resigned in February 1949 because of Morrison's political interference with NOPD activities. Throughout most of the 1950s, scandals continued to be revealed concerning the involvement of the NOPD in graft and vice. [...] In 1952, the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans was established as an independent monitor of the NOPD and the Morrison administration's approach to vice. State Police Colonel Francis Grevemberg, later a two-time gubernatorial candidate, led a series of high-profile raids on New Orleans gambling establishments that embarrassed Morrison and the NOPD for its inactivity. Eventually, retired FBI Agent Aaron M. Kohn was sent from Chicago to investigate NOPD involvement in vice. Kohn later recalled:"After about a year, I began to realize something about the system <b>down</b> <b>here.</b> <b>In</b> Chicago, people were generally {{on one side of the}} fence or the other—honest or crooked. But in Louisiana, there just isn't any fence." [...] He soon complained that Morrison was obstructing his efforts. In 1955, Morrison forced the mayor to ask for Schuering's resignation.|$|E
