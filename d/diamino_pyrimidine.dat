40|$|Drugs {{based on}} 5 -phenyl- 2, 4 <b>diamino</b> <b>pyrimidine</b> and 6 -phenyl- 1, 2, 4 {{triazine}} derivatives {{are well known}} for their effects on the central nervous system. The study presented here provides detailed crystal structures of two pyrimidine derivatives which have neuroprotective properties in models of both grey and white matter ischemia. Recently published {{studies suggest that the}} compounds lamotrigine (a triazine derivative), and the two pyrimidines BW 1003 C 87 (I) and sipatrigine (II) mediate their primary in vivo mode of action by inhibiting voltage-gated Na+ channels. The X-ray crystal structures will contribute valuable data for applications involving binding and modelling studies of the biological actions of these drugs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that one aspect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induced intestinal damage is due to either uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation or inhibition of electron transport. We investigated the latter possibility using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results Electron paramagnetic studies of NSAIDS on sub-mitochondrial particles revealed that indomethacin, but not with nabumetone, bound to a site near to Complex I and ubiquinone to generate a radical species. Normal rats exhibited prominent [3 Fe- 4 S]ox signals (g ~ 2. 01) at 20 K. One hour after indomethacin there was a prominent, intense and broad absorption pattern at (g ~ 2. 07) suggesting, appearance of radical species overlapping [3 Fe- 4 S]ox and was unaffected by pretreatment with 2, 4 diamino - 6 -hydroxy pyrimidine. At 24 hrs, when macroscopic ulcers were seen, there was a new signal due to a nitric oxide radical (NO•). In contrast, nabumetone and 2, 4 diamino- 6 -hydroxy pyrimidine pre-treated animals receiving indomethacin exhibited electron paramagnetic resonance spectra identical to those of controls at 24 hrs and neither was associated with small intestinal ulcers. Indomethacin and 2, 4 <b>diamino</b> hydroxy <b>pyrimidine</b> pre-treated rats, but not nabumetone, had increased intestinal permeability. Conclusion The results suggest that the in vivo effects of indomethacin modulate the mitochondrial respiratory chain directly at 1 h and 24 h through formation of nitric oxide. NO• appears {{to play an important role}} in the late pathogenic stages of NSAID enteropathy and may be the site for targeted treatment to reduce their toxicity. </p...|$|R
