For some of you, just like some politicians, the truth is of little to no value {{if it does not}} fit your preconceived notions, biases and agendas.|$|E
500|$|Kathy Iandoli of Idolator {{highlighted}} [...] "I Am" [...] as a [...] "gorgeous standout" [...] {{example of}} Lewis' ability to [...] "just [...] " [...] a song {{as opposed to}} using auto-tune on [...] "Power" [...] and over-singing on [...] "I Got You". Lewis Corner of Digital Spy felt that the track put [...] "Simon [...] in his place in a way Louis Walsh could only dream of." [...] Brad O'Mance for Popjustice likened the song to Massive Attack's 1991 song [...] "Unfinished Sympathy" [...] "with a different song on top", while Official Charts Company writer Rob Copsey described it as [...] "gutsy and uplifting". However, Michael Clemons of The Daily Reveille thought that while {{it was not a}} stand out track, it was a good listen. Chuck Campbell of Knoxville News Sentinel thought that the track's lyrical theme, and the album's theme as a whole, was flawed as a concept, writing [...] "The problem with repeatedly declaring you don’t need the approval of someone who has wronged you <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> message is false. Clearly if Lewis indulges in six straight bitter songs about defiantly rebounding from a bad relationship (which she does on “I Am”), she obviously craves validation from the very person (or people) who did her dirty." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} was opened by Dobriansky {{followed by a}} rendition of the U.S. national anthem, [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". [...] Senyshyn then read the invocation in English and Ukrainian and Roman Smal-Stocki, president of the memorial committee, spoke {{about the significance of}} the monument. [...] Perhaps the most prominent attendee was former U.S. President Eisenhower, who was chosen to unveil the statue. [...] Before he did so, Eisenhower was cheered for several minutes as the crowd chanted [...] "We Like Ike!" [...] Following a 12-minute speech, Eisenhower unveiled the statue, calling Shevchenko a Ukrainian hero and stated: [...] "For my hope <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> magnificent march from the shadow of the Washington Monument {{to the foot of the}} statue of Shevchenko will here kindle a new world movement in the hearts, minds, words and actions of men; a never-ending movement dedicated to the independence and freedom of peoples of all captive nations of the entire world." [...] He also said the statue represented [...] "millions of oppressed" [...] in Eastern Europe and [...] "gives them constant encouragement to struggle forever against Communist tyranny, until, one day final victory is achieved, as it most surely will be." [...] Following the unveiling, the Ukrainian Choral Societies of America led the crowd in a musical rendition of Shevchenko's poem [...] [...] Additional speeches were then made by several U.S. Representatives and Archbishop Ioan Theodorovych of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church gave the benediction. [...] The ceremony concluded with the crowd singing Ukraine's national anthem, Shche ne vmerla Ukraina (English: Ukraine Has Not Yet Died).|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Patient X" [...] the eighth most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show, citing, in particular the abuse of Dmitri. The article noted that [...] "If The X-Files has taught us anything, it’s that if a G-Man asks us if we know anything about anything and we foolishly say yes, our mouths and eyelids will be sewn shut {{and we will be}} brainwashed to kill on demand." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Patient X" [...] a B+, and wrote that the episode [...] "feels epic, in a way the mythology episodes do at their best". However, VanDerWerff noted that [...] "The problem with breaking the status quo on a TV series <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> audience is always going to know in the back of its head that the status quo isn’t really broken." [...] He reasoned that the audience never fully believed that [...] "Mulder could lose his belief in the all-consuming alien conspiracy" [...] or accept the idea that [...] "Scully could find herself dabbling with belief in [...]" [...] Despite these set-backs, however, he noted that [...] "Patient X" [...] was the episode where the series' mythology [...] "gets moving again, after chasing its own tail throughout much of season four and reaching a sort of climax in the opening episodes of season five." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two described the tone of [...] "Patient X" [...] as [...] "truly visceral", citing the faceless men incinerating people as well as the mutilation of the innocent Dmitri, who was [...] "at {{the wrong place at the}} wrong time". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised the episode for [...] "shift the goalposts" [...] and allowing Mulder and Scully to switch roles as the believer and skeptic. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's premise and writing. [...] "'Patient X' is a rare episode in that it actually advances The X-Files mythology, with the news of a vaccine to combat the black oil". However, she was critical of the episode's reliance on shock value, noting that the [...] "camera seems to take a perverse delight in death, pain, and mutilation, with the distressing effect of numbing the viewer to the horror." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{serving as}} president, Jefferson {{responds}} {{to a letter}} from Callis asking Jefferson for a position for Callis' son in the Navy. [...] "Washington, July 19,04 [...] In receipt of your letter asking employment in the Navy for your son. [...] I enclosed it to the Secretary of the Navy. [...] He is at present at Baltimore. [...] His answer <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> son can take his station with the midshipmen, and that his first employment will be {{in one of the}} gunboats. [...] You omitted to mention his name, or the warrant would now have been sent. [...] As I set out for Montecello in six days, it will be shorter for you to address the information to Robert Smith, Secretary of the Navy at Baltimore.

2500|$|An Egyptian Coptic ostracon {{that dates}} to {{around the year}} 600 bears the Greek words: [...] "Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, because thou didst {{conceive}} Christ, the Son of God, the Redeemer of our souls". This Eastern variant of the Ave Maria was apparently intended for liturgical use, just as the earliest form of the Hail Mary in the Western Church took {{the shape of an}} antiphon. However, {{there is little or no}} trace of the Hail Mary as an accepted [...] "devotional formula" [...] before about 1050. While two Anglo-Saxon manuscripts at the British Museum, one of which may be as old as the year 1030, show the words [...] "Ave Maria" [...] etc. and [...] "benedicta tu in mulieribus et benedictus fructus ventris tui" [...] it is not certain when these clauses were first joined to make one prayer The way that the rosary works <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> pray multiple of smaller prayers that became one huge prayer to worship and honor Jesus, Mary, and God.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} non-maleficence is {{embodied}} by the phrase, [...] "first, do no harm," [...] or the Latin, primum non nocere. Many consider {{that should be}} the main or primary consideration (hence primum): that it is more important not to harm your patient, than to do them good. This is partly because enthusiastic practitioners are prone to using treatments that they believe will do good, without first having evaluated them adequately to ensure they do no (or only acceptable levels of) harm. Much harm has been done to patients as a result, as in the saying, [...] "The treatment was a success, but the patient died." [...] It is not only more important to do no harm than to do good; {{it is also important to}} know how likely it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> treatment will harm a patient. So a physician should go further than not prescribing medications they know to be harmful—he or she should not prescribe medications (or otherwise treat the patient) unless s/he knows that the treatment is unlikely to be harmful; or at the very least, that patient understands the risks and benefits, and that the likely benefits outweigh the likely risks.|$|E
2500|$|On an {{occasion}} in 628, Wang was attending a feast held by Emperor Taizong, when a beautiful concubine of Emperor Taizong's, who was originally a concubine of Li Yuan the Prince of Lujiang {{and who was}} taken into Emperor Taizong's palace after Li Yuan was executed, was attending to Emperor Taizong. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "The Prince of Lujiang was despicable. [...] He killed her husband and seized her. [...] How could he survive long after this barbarous act!" [...] Wang instead responded, [...] "Does Your Imperial Majesty believe that the Prince of Lujiang was correct in seizing this woman?" [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Why do you ask me whether it is correct to kill a woman's husband and seize her?" [...] Wang responded, [...] "I had once read from the writings of Guan Zhong, which stated, 'When Duke Huan of Qi visited the land of Guo , he asked the seniors of Guo, [...] "Why was Guo destroyed?" [...] The seniors stated, [...] "The lord of Guo knew right from wrong." [...] Duke Huan responded, [...] "If you are correct, then he was an intelligent ruler. [...] Why was he destroyed?" [...] The seniors responded, [...] "The lord of Guo knew what was right but could not do it. [...] He also knew what was wrong but could not stop doing it. [...] That was why he was destroyed."' [...] Now, this woman is still by your side. [...] I believe it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>Your</b> Imperial Majesty in fact believes that this is right. [...] If you {{believe that this is}} wrong, you are the one who knows what is wrong and could not stop doing it." [...] Although Emperor Taizong could not send away the woman, he was nevertheless humbled by Wang's words and respected him for his words. [...] On another occasion, there was an incident where Emperor Taizong had the official Zu Xiaosun (祖孝孫) teach his ladies in waiting music, and when the ladies in waiting could not learn it well, rebuked Zu. [...] Wang and Wen Yanbo spoke against the rebuke, stating that it was not appropriate for Emperor Taizong to have had an important official become a music teacher for ladies in waiting in the first place. [...] Emperor Taizong became angry and rebuked Wen and Wang. [...] Wen bowed and begged for forgiveness, but Wang refused to do so, stating to Emperor Taizong that the rebuke to him and Wen was not warranted as they were reporting what was true. [...] Emperor Taizong was surprised, but the next day indicated to the high-level officials that he was rash and improper in rebuking Wang and Wen.|$|E
