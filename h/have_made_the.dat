5|$|A unique {{feature of}} {{architecture}} of ancient Sri Lanka, vatadages were {{built for the}} protection of small stupas that had an important relic enshrined in them or were built on hallowed ground. If the Polonnaruwa Vatadage is the shrine built by Parakramabahu I, the relic of the tooth of the Buddha would have been enshrined within it. Another possibility is that the alms bowl used by the Buddha may have been enshrined here. Both these relics were important objects in ancient Sri Lankan culture, and would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> Polonnaruwa Vatadage {{one of the most significant}} and venerated buildings in the country.|$|E
5|$|After Foliot's failed {{candidacy}} as bishop, in February 1216 John {{appointed him}} to the benefice of Colwall in Herefordshire, the king having {{the ability to make}} the appointment because Giles de Braose, the Bishop of Hereford, who would normally <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> appointment, had recently died. Also from this time comes Foliot's patronage of Robert Grosseteste, the theologian and future Bishop of Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E

5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp was {{observed}} intensively by astronomers during its perihelion passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. The dust production {{rate of the}} comet was very high (up to 2.0 kg/s), which may <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> inner coma optically thick. Based on {{the properties of the}} dust grains—high temperature, high albedo and strong 10μm silicate emission feature—the astronomers concluded the dust grains are smaller than observed in any other comet.|$|E
