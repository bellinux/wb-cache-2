25|$|The case, {{begun by}} the Australian Council of Trade Unions and {{supported}} by the Whitlam government, extended the reach of the original but limited equal pay decision of 1969.

Gaudron's argument was based on the principles of the 1951 <b>Equal</b> <b>Remuneration</b> Convention of the International Labour Organization (an organisation she would later work for). However, Gaudron later came to regard her argument, that Australia had not ratified the Convention because the Commission would not grant equal pay (thus preventing Australia from fulfilling its obligations under the Convention), as somewhat disingenuous, and recalled it with a measure of embarrassment.|$|E

50|$|In 1976, the <b>Equal</b> <b>Remuneration</b> Act {{was passed}} {{with the aim}} of {{providing}} <b>equal</b> <b>remuneration</b> to men and women workers and to prevent {{discrimination on the basis of}} gender in all matters relating to employment and employment opportunities. This legislation not only provides women with a right to demand equal pay, but any inequality with respect to recruitment processes, job training, promotions, and transfers within the organization can also be challenged under this Act. However, its scope does not extend to situations where: (i) a woman is attempting to comply with the requirements of laws giving women special treatment; and (ii) a woman is being accorded special treatment on account of the birth of a child, or the terms and conditions relating to retirement, marriage or death. Companies and individual employers can both be held accountable to maintain the standards prescribed under this Act. In various cases, the Supreme Court of India has also held that discrimination on the basis of gender only arises when men and women perform the same work or work of a similar nature. However, it clarified that a flexible approach is required to be taken while deciding which kinds of work may be similar by considering the duties actually performed as a part of the job, and not the duties potentially capable of being performed.|$|E

50|$|All parties {{acknowledged}} that the principles in the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention Concerning <b>Equal</b> <b>Remuneration</b> for Men and Women Workers of Equal Value (Convention 100) extend beyond requiring equal pay for the same work.

However, given the general nature of the Convention and the expansiveness of the interpretation of s 3(1)(b) of the Act that it supports, their Honours held that it was of limited use to them in deciding this case.|$|E
