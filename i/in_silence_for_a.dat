5|$|Moving back to 1919, {{the elderly}} Raoul visits Christine's gravesite and places {{the music box}} near her tombstone. He stands <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment and then turns to leave, but stops upon noticing a fresh red rose with a black ribbon tied around the stem {{lying on the ground}} with Christine's {{engagement}} ring attached to it; implying that the Phantom still lives and still loves Christine.|$|E
500|$|... "Cry" [...] was {{promoted}} by a music video, or [...] "short film," [...] as Jackson would refer to it. The video {{was directed by}} Nicholas Brandt, who had previously directed [...] "Earth Song" [...] (1995), [...] "Childhood" [...] (1995) and [...] "Stranger in Moscow" [...] (1996), {{all of which were}} featured on Jackson's [...] album. The video was filmed in six different locations, all were filmed in California. People featured in the video included members of a real life gospel group. The video begins with dozens of people of different ages, ethnicities and races holding hands. Long lines of people were stretched over mountains, across highways, in a forest and on the beach. Everyone stands <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> majority of the video. Following the bridge, everyone begins singing the chorus. Towards the final chorus, the group collectively clap their hands along with the song, taking hands once more as the song ends.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} Sherlock Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet (1887), Doctor Watson compares Holmes to Dupin, to which Holmes replies: [...] "No doubt {{you think you}} are complimenting me ... In my opinion, Dupin was a very {{inferior}} fellow... He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appears to imagine". Alluding to an episode in [...] "The Murders in the Rue Morgue", where Dupin deduces what his friend is thinking despite their having walked together <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quarter of an hour, [...] Holmes remarks: [...] "That trick of his breaking in on his friend's thoughts with an apropos remark... is really very showy and superficial"; nevertheless, Holmes later performs the same 'trick' on Watson in [...] "The Adventure of the Cardboard Box".|$|E
60|$|Father Grumbler stared <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, {{and then}} he began to swear so loudly that even his family, {{accustomed}} as they were to his language, wondered at him.|$|R
60|$|With one accord, {{and without}} a word passing between them, they left the {{neighborhood}} of the cottage hurriedly; then stopped on a sudden, and attentively looked {{each other in the}} face--looked <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant. Trudaine spoke first.|$|R
60|$|The {{stiffness}} {{had gone}} from my brain and fingers. My pen flew over the paper. The joy of creation sang once more in my heart, tingled in all my pulses.

2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E

60|$|I {{looked up}} and almost {{expected}} fire from heaven. This coincidence was {{like the end of}} the world. I had sat down feeling that somehow or other Park-lane must be pulled down; and I had sat down beside the man who wanted to pull it down. I bowed <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant under the approaching apocalypse; and in that instant the man turned sharply and started talking like a torrent.|$|R
60|$|They {{walked on}} <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> nearly <b>a</b> block, {{and the boy}} was {{wondering}} how best to leave Norris without offending him when the latter spoke up.|$|R

60|$|Eric sat <b>in</b> dismayed <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. That {{beautiful}} creature afflicted {{in such a}} fashion--why, it was horrible! Mingled {{with his}} dismay was a strange pang of personal regret and disappointment.|$|R
6000|$|<b>In</b> <b>silence,</b> then, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> spell, the German {{mercenary}} pondered {{her with}} those slowly kindling eyes, that slowly spreading, indefinite smile. Then he stirred, {{and to his}} secretary he muttered shortly: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked on}} the heavens <b>in</b> {{profound}} <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{minute or two}} longer, and then again stepped into the apartment, where Varney {{seemed to have been}} engaged in putting the Earl's jewels into a casket.|$|R

60|$|For {{the next}} ten minutes we ate <b>in</b> <b>silence,</b> <b>for</b> Stephen had <b>an</b> {{excellent}} appetite and was hungry after his morning climb.|$|R
60|$|The {{two men had}} sat <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> <b>for</b> quite <b>a</b> {{considerable}} time after Frederick Power had marched out of the room.
