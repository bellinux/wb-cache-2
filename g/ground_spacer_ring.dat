The main {{purpose was to}} reduce the total liquid sample consumption during an experiment, but also to gain advantages with respect to kinetics and mass transport by reducing the boundary diffusion layer. The bottom of the flow chamber is a QCM-D sensor surface, on which a polydimethylsiloxane <b>spacer</b> <b>ring,</b> fabricated onto a poly(methyl methacrylate) lid, is placed symmetrically around the QCM-D electrode (diameter similar to 10 mm). The <b>spacer</b> <b>ring</b> defines the inner chamber height (typically 40 - 50 mu m) and provides sealing. Through the lid, there are inlet and outlet channels. The typical chamber volume is {{in the range of}} 2. 5 - 3. 5 mu l (with a 10 mu l dead volume). In flow mode, we have operated the cell at flow rates of 6 - 50 mu l/min, i. e., volume turnovers of 2 - 17 per min. As a model system, to test the microcell, the formation of supported phospholipid bilayers on a SiO 2 surface was studied. For comparison, the same process was studied in a commercially available QCM-D equipment with significantly larger total volume (by a factor of 20). The decrease in effective sample consumption to produce a bilayer on the sensor surface in the chamber was approximately proportional to the decrease in chamber volume. Smaller volume also reduced the liquid exchange time.

50|$|A serious {{incident}} occurred on 1 August 1983. Pressure tube G16 in the Pickering A Unit 2 reactor developed a 2 metre long split. The reactor was safely {{shut down and}} the damage investigated. The cause {{was found to be}} the mislocation of annulus gas spacer springs which allowed the pressure tube to sag inside the calandria tube leading to hydrogen enrichment of the cooler areas. This made the tube more brittle so that it ruptured. There was some local fuel damage and the reactor was safely shut down by the operators with no increase in radioactive emissions.

In this study new roll structure is considered where a ceramics sleeve is connected with steel shafts at both ends by shrink fitting. Here, the ceramics sleeve may provide a longer lifetime and reduces the cost for the maintenance. However, attention should {{be paid to the}} maximum tensile stresses appearing between the ceramics sleeve, <b>spacer</b> <b>rings</b> and steel shafts because the fracture toughness, plasticity and fatigue strengths of ceramics are extremely lower than the values of steel.

40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{a range of}} issues {{relating}} to the use of a vane-recessed tubular-passage casing treatment as a passive stall control technique in a multistage axial-flow compressor. The focus of the research was to determine whether such a treatment could delay the initiation of stall at lower mass flow rates as well as providing the most beneficial improvement in flow characteristics without sacrificing compressor efficiencies. Specific objectives of this study were to examine possible improvements or deterioration in the flow characteristics including stall margin, peak pressure rise coefficients and maximum efficiency in a multistage axial flow compressor. A casing treatment in addition to several <b>spacer</b> <b>rings</b> was developed from two initial designs and tested on the first stage of a low speed three-stage axial-flow compressor with a (0. 7) hub to tip diameter ratio. The treatment configuration consisted of three parts: an outer casing ring, with a tubular shaped passage on the inside diameter, a set of 120 evenly spaced curved vanes, and a shroud or inner ring. The casing treatment was positioned following the inlet guide vanes upstream and partly covering the tip of the rotor blades. The main parts of the casing treatment including the recessed vanes in addition to some of the <b>spacer</b> <b>rings</b> were manufactured from high quality acrylic. Eight additional <b>spacer</b> <b>rings</b> of various shapes and geometry were added. The first ring held and partly covered the IGVs, in front of the casing treatment. The rotor tip exposure ratio was thought to {{have a significant impact on}} the effectiveness of the casing treatment. Therefore the other seven rings were used to provide the desired uncovered region of the rotor tip axial chord of about 10 % in order to provide a range of exposures of (23. 2 %, 33. 3 %, 43. 4 %, 53. 5 %, 63. 6 %, 73. 7 %, and 83. 8 %). The results showed significant improvements in stall margin in all treated casing configurations along with insignificant efficiency sacrifices in some compressor builds. About (28. 56 %) of stall margin improvement in terms of corrected mass flow rate was achieved using a casing treatment with a (33. 3 %) rotor tip exposure. The compressor build with (0. 535) rotor exposure ratios was the best configuration in terms of efficiency gain and loss characteristics. This build was able to provide the highest values of the maximum efficiencies in comparison with the performance achieved from the solid casing. An improvement of (1. 81 %) in the maximum efficiency in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, in association with a (22. 54 %) stall margin improvement in terms of the corrected mass flow rates were achieved by the application of this treatment configuration. The improvement in the peak pressure rise coefficients in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, obtained from this build was (2. 33 %). The compressor configuration using a casing treatment with a (0. 636) rotor exposure ratio was the best build in terms of the pressure rise coefficients. This configuration was able to provide highest value of the peak pressure rise in comparison with the characteristics achieved from the datum build. An improvement of (2. 65 %) in the peak pressure rise coefficient in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, in association with a (22. 49 %) improvement in stall margin in terms of the corrected mass flow rates was achieved from this casing treatment build. The improvement in maximum efficiency in terms of the overall total-total pressure ratio, obtained from this build was (1. 03 %). The results suggest that the vane-recessed tubular-passage casing treatment designed as part of this investigation achieved the objectives, which were established for the research. In the majority of instances it not only produced gains in flow range, pressure rise coefficients and efficiencies, but also enabled the rotating stall, which developed at much lower mass flow rates in the compressor, to become progressive rather than abrupt...|$|R

Currently CERN is the only main distributor of large GEM foils, however with the growing interest in GEM technology {{keeping up with the}} increasing demand for GEMs will be difficult. Thus the commercialization of GEMs up to 50 × 50 cm^ 2 has been established by Tech-Etch Inc. of Plymouth, MA, USA using the single-mask technique. The electrical performance and optical quality of the single-mask GEM foils {{have been found to be}} on par with those produced by CERN. The next critical step towards validating the Tech-Etch single-mask GEM foils is to test their performance under physics conditions. These measurements will allow us to quantify and compare the gain and efficiency of the detector to other triple-GEM detectors. This will be done by constructing several single-mask triple-GEM detectors, using foils manufactured by Tech-Etch, which follow the design used by the STAR Forward GEM Tracker (FGT). These detectors will investigate ways in which to further decrease the material budget and increase the efficiency of the detector by incorporating perforated Kapton <b>spacer</b> <b>rings</b> rather than G 10 spacing grids to reduce the dead area of the detector.

40|$|The {{degradation}} of the grease used to lubricate railroad bearings {{is believed to be}} caused by two processes: the mechanical processes occurring within the bearing and a diffusion process. Appropriate lubrication of the bearings is critical during railroad service operation. The study presented here will focus on the development of empirical models that can accurately predict the residual useful life of railroad bearing grease. Modeling techniques to be employed include regression, regression trees and split plots. The data set used {{in the development of the}} model consists of more than 100 samples of grease that were taken from railroad bearings. The bearings have been subjected to experimental variables such as load conditions, rotational speed, temperature, and mileage all of which have been observed in a laboratory setting. The mileage parameter is consistent with the total miles that were run using the grease from which the sample has been taken. Load, speed, and temperature values fluctuate within the total service operation of the bearing; therefore, a high value, a low value, and a weighted average are taken for the aforementioned parameters. The grease samples are taken from critical locations of the bearing, the inboard raceway, the outboard raceway and the <b>spacer</b> <b>ring</b> area, meaning that there are three samples collected from each railroad bearing, each having their own set of corresponding parameters. The oxidation induction time (OIT) of the grease is an indicator of the residual life of the grease; therefore, the OIT for each sample had been acquired using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC).

In situ sample verification systems such as this Distributed Capacitive (DisC) sensor would enable an unmanned spacecraft system to re-attempt the sample acquisition procedures until the capture of desired sample quantity is positively confirmed, thereby maximizing the prospect for scientific reward. The DisC device contains a 10 -cm-diameter pressure-sensitive elastic membrane placed {{at the bottom of a}} sample canister. The membrane deforms under the weight of accumulating planetary sample. The membrane is positioned in close proximity to an opposing rigid substrate with a narrow gap. The deformation of the membrane makes the gap narrower, resulting in increased capacitance between the two parallel plates (elastic membrane and rigid substrate). C-V conversion circuits on a nearby PCB (printed circuit board) provide capacitance readout via LVDS (low-voltage differential signaling) interface. The capacitance method was chosen over other potential approaches such as the piezoelectric method because of its inherent temperature stability advantage. A reference capacitor and temperature sensor are embedded in the system to compensate for temperature effects. The pressure-sensitive membranes are aluminum 6061, stainless steel (SUS) 403, and metal-coated polyimide plates. The thicknesses of these membranes range from 250 to 500 m.

Analysis of these titrations shows that the dimeric rings open at rates of approximately 10 (- 2) s- 1, independent of the divalent hapten's <b>spacer</b> length. The <b>ring</b> closure rate, however, decreases with spacer length. The latter observation was qualitatively rationalized {{in terms of the}} diffusion process of a Gaussian chain which relates the ring closure rate constant to the expectation value for the distance between the free ends of the respective open chain...|$|R
40|$|Since {{mechanical}} {{accuracy is}} of major {{importance in the}} field of optics, piece production is still prevailing and implementations of techniques of mass producti on are a challenge. Using injection molding of plastic elements onto sheet metal s (e. g. so-called OUTSERT-technology) provides a new approach to resolve this issue. Clearly, such a technique could save <b>spacers</b> and retainer <b>rings</b> as well as process time in assembly and allow an economical production of optics mounts at high production rates, if the required mechanical accuracy can be met. For a mob ile projection application, the lens barrel of a fix-focus projection lens has b een realized in this technology. The design is based on a segmented lens cage w ith fixed and loose plastic bearings parts for each optical element. Important f or accurate lens alignment is a 3 -fold symmetry of the cage. Due to the symmetrical layout, reproducibility of the injection molding process is of greater impor tance than absolute mechanical accuracy. A careful characterization of the const ituent parts has been performed, using non-contacting 3 d-shape measurements. The data obtained so far reveal satisfying results with respect to reproducibility and selected dimensions of the lens seats. Also, tilt deviations of the lens sur faces in the assembled mount were determined. Further, a preliminary measurement of the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), to check the optical performance, ha s been obtained and shows encouraging results...|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} discovered histamine H 4 receptor (H 4 R) {{is reported to}} be involved in immunological processes and inflammatory diseases. However, the (patho) physiological role of the H 4 R is far from being fully understood. Controversial data on H 4 R agonists as well as reports on β-arrestin-mediated signaling and partial agonistic effects of the standard H 4 R antagonist JNJ- 7777120 at certain H 4 R species orthologs complicate the interpretation of in vivo studies. Therefore, additional potent and receptor subtype selective H 4 R ligands, antagonists as well as agonists, are required as pharmacological tools. Discrimination between the closely related H 3 and H 4 receptors {{turned out to be a}} critical issue in the development of selective H 4 R agonists. Starting from UR-PI 376, a lead from our laboratory, the major objective of this thesis was the design, synthesis and pharmacological characterization of bioisosteric and conformationally constrained cyanoguanidine-type H 4 R agonist to evaluate structure-activity and –selectivity relationships. The prepared compounds were investigated for agonism and antagonism at the human (h) H 1 R, H 2 R, H 3 R and H 4 R in functional [35 S]GTPyS binding assays or steady-state GTPase assays, respectively, using Sf 9 cell membranes expressing the HR subtype of interest. Selected compounds were evaluated in radioligand binding studies at the human HR subtypes (Sf 9 cell membranes) and mouse H 4 R (mH 4 R expressed in HEK 293 cells). In addition, representative compounds were investigated in a luciferase gene reporter assay at mH 4 R and hH 4 R using genetically engineered HEK 293 cells. In a first approach, based on a previously suggested model of UR-PI 376 binding to the hH 4 R, the tetramethylene chain in UR-PI 376 was replaced by conformationally restricted <b>spacers</b> connecting imidazole <b>ring</b> with the cyanoguanidine moiety. Phenylene linkers proved to be inappropriate: None of the prepared compounds or amine precursor showed relevant activity at the H 3 R and H 4 R. To retain some flexibility, in a second series the phenylene was replaced by a cyclohexylene linker. Compounds with a cis-configured 1, 4 -cyclohexylene spacer, turned out to be moderately potent and selective hH 4 R agonists. The same holds for the building block, cis- 4 -(1 H-imidazol- 4 -yl) cyclohexylamine. In case of the trans-configured analogues, there was a tendency toward preference for the hH 3 R. To optimize the <b>spacer</b> regarding <b>ring</b> size, balance between rigidification and flexibility, regioisomers and stereochemical properties a cyclopentane- 1, 3 -diyl moiety and an additional exocyclic methylene group were introduced. The most potent H 4 R agonists identified among a set of 14 racemic compounds were separated by chiral HPLC to yield eight enantiomerically pure compounds. trans-(+) -(1 S, 3 S) -UR-RG 98 was the most potent and selective H 4 R agonist in this series with an EC 50 of 11 nM, a more than 100 -fold selectivity for the H 4 R over the H 3 R and negligible activities at the other HR subtypes. By contrast, the optical antipode, trans-(-) -(1 R, 3 R) -UR-RG 98, proved to be an H 4 R antagonist in the [35 S]GTPyS assay. The absolute configuration of the stereoisomers was determined subsequent to an enzyme-assisted stereoselective synthesis. In search for bioisosteric replacements of the imidazole ring in cyanoguanidine-type H 4 R agonists, ten different heterocycles were combined with linkers of various chain lengths and substitution patterns. A total of 42 compounds, cyanoguanidines and amine precursor, were synthesized and evaluated at the HR subtypes. The exchange of the 4 -imidazolyl ring considerably affected the activities at all HRs. Only the 2 - and 5 -methyl substituted imidazoles showed H 4 R agonistic potency. None of the investigated compounds was superior to UR-PI 376. In an attempt to synthesize fluorescent H 4 R ligands several fluorophores (pyrylium, bodipy and cyanine dyes) were coupled to a benzimidazole building block, reported to have high H 4 R affinity. The Ki-values of the labeled compounds were only in the micromolar range (1. 3 - 30 µM) at the hH 4 R and the other HR subtypes as well, suggesting that a different affinity-conferring moiety should be selected. The investigation of selected H 4 R agonists revealed neither cytotoxicity nor hemolytic activity but remarkable plasma protein binding (up to 94...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} the biomechanical effect of an intervertebral spacer on construct stiffness in a PVC model and cadaveric canine cervical vertebral columns stabilized with monocortical screws/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). STUDY DESIGN Biomechanical study. SAMPLE POPULATION PVC pipe; cadaveric canine vertebral columns. METHODS PVC model-PVC pipe {{was used to}} create a gap model mimicking vertebral endplate orientation and disk space width of large-breed canine cervical vertebrae; 6 models had a 4 -mm gap with no spacer (PVC group 1); 6 had a PVC pipe <b>ring</b> <b>spacer</b> filling the gap (PCV group 2). Animals-large breed cadaveric canine cervical vertebral columns (C 2 -C 7) from skeletally mature dogs without (cadaveric group 1, n[*]=[*] 6, historical data) and with an intervertebral disk spacer (cadaveric group 2, n[*]=[*] 6) were used. All PVC models and cadaver specimens were instrumented with monocortical titanium screws/PMMA. Stiffness of the 2 PVC groups was compared in extension, flexion, and lateral bending using non-destructive 4 -point bend testing. Stiffness testing in all 3 directions was performed of the unaltered C 4 -C 5 vertebral motion unit in cadaveric spines and repeated after placement of an intervertebral cortical allograft ring and instrumentation. Data were compared using a linear mixed model approach that also incorporated data from previously tested spines with the same screw/PMMA construct but without disk spacer (cadaveric group 1). RESULTS Addition of a spacer increased construct stiffness in both the PVC model (P[*]<[*]. 001) and cadaveric vertebral columns (P[*]<[*]. 001) compared to fixation without a spacer.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{technical}} feasibility and mechanical properties of 3 locking plate designs (Zero-P, Zero-P VA, and Uniplate 2) {{for use in}} the canine cervical spine. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective ex vivo study. ANIMALS: Cadaver cervical spines from skeletally mature large breed dogs (n[*]=[*] 18). METHODS: Specimens were screened using radiography and allocated into balanced groups based on bone density. Stiffness of intact C 4 -C 5 vertebral motion units was measured in extension, flexion, and lateral bending using nondestructive 4 -point bend testing. Uniplate 2 was then implanted at C 4 -C 5 and mechanical testing was repeated. Mechanical test data were compared against those from 6 spines implanted with monocortical screws, an allograft <b>ring</b> <b>spacer,</b> and PMMA. RESULTS: The Zero-P and Zero-P VA systems could not be surgically implanted due to anatomical constraints in the vertebral column sizes of the canine cervical spines used in this study. Fixation with Uniplate 2 or with screws/PMMA significantly increased stiffness of the C 4 -C 5 vertebral motion units compared to unaltered specimens (P[*]<[*]. 001) in extension. Stiffness of the titanium screw/PMMA fixation was significantly greater than the Uniplate 2 construct in extension. Flexion and lateral bending could not be evaluated in 3 of 6 specimens in the Uniplate 2 group due to failure at the bone/implant interface during extension testing. CONCLUSION: Fixation with Uniplate 2 was biomechanically inferior to screws/PMMA. Particularly concerning was the incidence of vertebral fracture after several testing cycles. Based on our results, Zero-P, Zero-P VA, and Uniplate 2 cannot be recommended for use in dogs requiring cervical fusion. This is the author accepted manuscript.

40|$|A donor-acceptor dyad {{composed}} of BF 2 -chelated dipyrromethene (BDP or BODIPY) and fullerene {{connected with a}} pyrrole <b>ring</b> <b>spacer,</b> 1, has been newly synthesized and characterized. Because of a-carbon substitution and extended conjugation offered by the pyrrole ring, the optical absorbance and emission spectra of BDP macrocycle {{were found to be}} red-shifted significantly. Electrochemical studies provided information on the redox potentials while computational studies performed at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G* level yielded an optimized geometry of the dyad that was close to that reported earlier for a BDP-C 60 dyad covalently connected through the central boron atom, 2. The HOMO of the dyad was found to be on the BDP macrocycle, extended over the pyrrole bridging group, a property that is expected to facilitate electronic communication between the BDP and fullerene entities. The established energy level diagram using spectral, redox, and optimized structural results predicted possibility of photoinduced electron transfer in both benzonitrile and toluene, representing polar and nonpolar solvents. However, such energy diagram suggested different routes for the charge recombination processes, that is, direct relaxation of the radical ion-pair in polar solvent while populating the triplet level of the sensitizer ((BDP) -B- 3 * or C- 3 (60) *) in nonpolar solvent. Proof for charge separation and solvent dependent charge recombination processes were established from studies involving femto- and nanosecond pump-probe spectroscopy. The measured rate of charge separation, kCS, for 1 was higher in both solvents compared to the earlier reported values for 2 due to electronically well-communicating pyrrole spacer. The charge recombination in toluene populated (BDP) -B- 3 * as an intermediate step while in benzonitrile it yielded directly ground state of the dyad. The present findings reveal the significance of pyrrole spacer between the donor and acceptor to facilitate charge separation and solvent polarity dependent charge recombination processes...|$|R
