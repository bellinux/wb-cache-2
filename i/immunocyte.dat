While working in Centocor, Tse Wen Chang invented this technology in 1983. When the Changs were setting up Tanox in 1986, they bought the rights on these antibody matrix patents from Centocor to help formulate their first business plan. Tanox made efforts to develop “immunosorbent cytometry” methodology to determine the <b>immunocyte</b> profile, such as the concentrations and proportions of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in blood, for monitoring the immune status of individuals infected with the AIDS virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which was causing expanding epidemic in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the anti-IgE program and other therapeutic antibody programs eventually absorbed all resources Tanox had, and the antibody matrix program was not pursued further.|$|E
40|$|In maxillary {{sinusitis}} pathogenesis researchers {{paid much}} attention to the role of paranasal sinuses, sinus drainage dysfunctions, mucocyliary transport system disorders in cases of damage of sinuses mucous membranes. Pathohistological, immunohistochemical and morphometric studies of mucosa were conducted. However, to evaluate the local inflammatory response in cases of chronic sinusitis and improvement of individual therapy for the patients, the immunohistochemical studies of the composition of inflammatory <b>immunocyte</b> infiltrates of paranasal sinus mucosa and adenoid vegetations bioptate would be reasonable. The aim of the research was to study the immunohistochemical content of <b>immunocyte</b> infiltrates of paranasal sinuses adenomatous polyps in biopsy samples of patients suffering from chronic sinusitis. Materials and Methods. Paranasal sinuses adenomatous polyps removed during surgery of 22 patients suffering from chronic maxillary sinusitis were studied. Immunohistochemical studies of paraffin sections of the removed polyps were performed using appropriate primary antibodies and visualization systems DAKO EnVision+ System (DAKO, Denmark). Results. During microscopic investigation of paranasal sinuses adenomatous polyps of the patients suffering from chronic sinusitis, moderate and severe <b>immunocyte</b> infiltration of polyp stroma sometimes with focal follicular structures was presented. Immunohistochemical investigation of the cellular composition of these infiltrates proved the presence of CD 8 + T-killer cells, CD 4 + T-helper cells, CD 68 + macrophages as well as single plasma cells. The irregularity of these cells markers expression was determined in dependence of the severity of inflammatory cell infiltration. Conclusions. In the patients with chronic maxillary polyp sinusitis with mild and moderate <b>immunocyte</b> infiltration of paranasal sinus mucosa, among immune cells the CD 4 + T-lymphocytes occupied the most relative area in polyp stroma, plasma cells – the least (р < 0. 001). In the patients with significant immunocellular infiltration in <b>immunocyte</b> follicular infiltration of polyp stroma the relative area of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-lymphocytes significantly exceeded the relative area of macrophages and plasma cells. ...|$|E

Normal colon specimens were used as reference material, mostly paired from individual subjects. The density (median of cells/mm 2 lamina propria area) of IgA <b>immunocytes</b> tended to be slightly higher in the appendix than in the colon (1259 vs 962) and the same held true for IgM cells (71 vs 55). Conversely, the overall density of IgG <b>immunocytes</b> was much higher in the appendix than in the colon (95 vs 38). A striking feature {{was the fact that}} almost 50 % of all <b>immunocytes</b> were of the IgG isotype adjacent to lymphoid follicles. It seemed justified to conclude, therefore, that the abundance of such follicles explains the overall enrichment of IgG-producing cells in normal appendix mucosa.

Recent mass strandings of the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and rising mortalities of the endangered Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) have raised questions {{on the extent to}} which pollution, infectious disease, 2 ̆ 2 stress, 2 ̆ 2 and captivity influence the immune system of these animals. This study has provided the first in-depth characterization of immunocytes in the peripheral blood of dolphins (n = 190) and manatees (n = 56). <b>Immunocyte</b> morphology and baseline values were determined in clinically normal animals under free-ranging, stranded and captive living conditions as well as by age and sex. Additionally, <b>immunocyte</b> population dynamics were characterized in sick animals. This was accomplished with traditional cytochemical techniques and new lymphocyte phenotyping methodology which was validated in this study. Traditional cytochemical techniques demonstrated that blood <b>immunocyte</b> morphology and cell numbers are similar to terrestrial mammals with some notable exceptions. The manatee heterophilic granulocyte is a morphologically unique cell and probably functions similarly to the typical mammalian neutrophil. Eosinophils were rarely found in manatees but were uncommonly high in healthy and sick dolphins. Basophils were not identified. Manatees had higher total lymphocyte numbers compared to dolphins and most terrestrial mammals. Lymphocyte subsets identified in healthy animals included Th, Tc/s, B and NK cells. Dolphin and manatee T and B cell values were higher than those reported in man and most terrestrial mammals. The manatee has extraordinarily high absolute numbers of circulating Th cells which suggests an enhanced immunological response capability. With few exceptions, <b>immunocyte</b> types and absolute numbers were not significantly different between free-ranging, stranded and captive categories or between sex and age categories. The evaluation of <b>immunocyte</b> dynamics in various disease states demonstrated a wide variation in cellular responses which provided new insights into innate, humoral and cell-mediated immunity in these species. Additionally, this study demonstrated that lymphocyte phenotyping has diagnostic significance and could be developed into a potential indicator of immunocompetence in both free-ranging and captive dolphin and manatee populations. ...|$|E

We recently reported that Fas(-/-) mice with a BALB/c background (BALB/c Fas(-/-) mice) developed blepharitis with allergic inflammation that was accompanied by hyper-IgE production. Here, we found a novel type of <b>immunocyte</b> in the spleen of BALB/c Fas(-/-) mice, which enhanced the production of IgE by B cells in the presence of IL- 4 and CD 40 signaling in vitro. The <b>immunocyte</b> did not express lineage markers but expressed Thy- 1 and Sca- 1 just like recently identified type 2 innate lymphoid cells, such as natural helper (NH) cells and nuocytes. However, they did not express c-Kit, IL- 7 R and IL- 33 R (T 1 /ST 2), important markers of type 2 innate lymphoid cells. Instead, our identified Lin(-) Thy- 1 (+) Sca- 1 (+) cells expressed IL- 18 R and secreted Th 2 cytokines when co-cultured with B cells or when stimulated with IL- 18 and IL- 2. Moreover, we found essentially the same type of cells in BALB/c wild-type mice as in BALB/c Fas(-/-) mice, which enhanced IgE production in contact with B cells in vitro. These cells from BALB/c wild-type mice expressed Fas and were sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Collectively, the newly identified Lin(-) Thy- 1 (+) Sca- 1 (+) cell, which we designated a F-NH cell (Fas-expressing natural helper cell), is a novel type 2 innate <b>immunocyte</b> with activity to enhance IgE production from B cells with the help of IL- 4 and CD 40 signaling.

Using a newly developed experimental system in which full-thickness human skin is orthotopically transferred onto severe combined immunodeficient mice, autologous <b>immunocytes</b> were injected into dermis, and the resultant phenotype characterized by clinical, histologic, and immunophenotypic analyses. Engraftment of samples included both uninvolved/ symptomless (PN) skin removed from patients with psoriasis elsewhere, or from healthy individuals with no skin disease (NN skin). In 10 different experiments involving 6 different psoriasis patients, every PN skin was converted to a full-fledged psoriatic plaque skin by injection of autologous blood-derived <b>immunocytes.</b> In all but one psoriatic patient, the <b>immunocytes</b> required preactivation with IL- 2 and superantigens to convert PN skin into psoriatic plaque skin.

Lesional skin displayed 20 different antigenic determinants of the psoriatic phenotype. None of the four NN skin samples injected with autologous <b>immunocytes</b> converted to psoriatic plaques.
