50|$|The {{discrimination}} by the French authorities against these soldiers continued as successive French governments froze the war pensions of these indigenous veterans when their countries became independent. The closing credits {{of the film}} state that, despite the ruling that war pensions should be paid in full, successive French administrations since 2002 had not done so. It was only after the film's release that the government policy was changed to bring <b>foreign</b> <b>combatant</b> pensions into line with what French veterans are paid. But, as of 2010, no war pension in arrears (almost 40 years) have been considered.|$|E

40|$|By {{examining}} some of {{the letters}} Romanian volunteers in the International Brigades sent home during the Spanish Civil War, this article explores their authors' experience of the front-line hardships and of the challenges associated with the military life-style. The paper first provides a concise historical account of the Spanish Civil War, {{with a focus on}} the emergence of the international military groups, consisting of <b>foreign</b> <b>combatants.</b> It subsequently investigates the reasons that determined the Romanian volunteers to leave their country to fight in Spain, by examining their motivation in the intricate political and social context of interwar Romania. Finally, the article deals with the negative outcomes these letters had for their recipients, translated into the permanent harassment their families and close ones suffered because of this correspondence...|$|R
50|$|The Multinational Force in Lebanon (MNF) was an {{international}} peacekeeping force created in August 1982 following the 1981 U.S.-brokered ceasefire between the PLO and Israel {{to end their}} involvement in the conflict between Lebanons pro-government and pro-Syrian factions. The ceasefire held until June 3, 1982 when the Abu Nidal Organization attempted to assassinate Shlomo Argov, Israels ambassador to London. Three days later, Israel reentered the PLO-controlled West Beirut and blockaded the city in order to contain insurgency. Seven weeks into the blockade, the besieged PLO acceded to a new agreement for their withdrawal. The agreement provided for the deployment of a Multinational Force to assist the Lebanese Armed Forces in evacuating the PLO, Syrian forces and other <b>foreign</b> <b>combatants</b> involved in Lebanons civil war.|$|R

40|$|Overview The {{trend of}} young people {{travelling}} from Australia and other western nations to fight in conflict zones in Syria and Iraq is causing {{a great deal of}} concern for our politicians, policy makers and society at large. However, this phenomenon is not a new one, nor is it solely linked to Islamic countries. Westerners have been involved in conflicts as <b>foreign</b> <b>combatants</b> for hundreds of years. Historians and analysts argue there are lessons that we can learn from past conflicts when working out {{how to deal with the}} problem of foreign fighters and the risks they can pose both abroad and at home.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{conflicts}} {{that in the past}} 35 years have triggered Muslims worldwide to leave their home country and become a so-called foreign fighter. Since 1980, seven conflict zones attracted in total more than 40, 000 unpaid combatants with no apparent link to the conflict other than religious affinity with the Muslim side. Partly for this reason, these insurgencies have drawn considerable attention from scholars and media but also from those Islamists leaders who wish to globalize local conflicts and promote the jihadist narrative. However, most seem to ignore {{the fact that there are}} huge differences in the number of transnational insurgents who actually joined the fight. Connected conflicts like Afghanistan (1980 - 1992), Bosnia (1992 - 1995), Iraq (since 2003) and Syria (since 2011) each attracted several thousands of foreign fighters, whereas other conflicts like Chechnya (1994 - 2009), Somalia (1993 - 2014) and Afghanistan after 2001 could not count on more than a few hundred <b>foreign</b> <b>combatants.</b> Some have argued this is merely a coincidence, but no one has so far addressed this issue thoroughly. This study tries to offer a first preliminary explanation by testing five factors that possibly could be relevant to explain why some conflicts attract far more foreign fighters than others...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the U. S. {{codification}} of its Geneva Convention obligations to prosecute war crimes. The War Crimes Statute is rarely used for its original enactment purpose. Instead the cases that have appeared are in response to political maneuvering in detaining <b>foreign</b> enemy <b>combatants.</b> The War Crimes Statute has been used with the Geneva Convention in order to guarantee detainees certain fundamental rights to due process and impartial hearings. Finally, the paper examines some of the Legislative responses to this judicial interpretation and the new proposed War Crimes Statute...|$|R

5000|$|On 3 June, Iraqi forces {{moved into}} a {{southern}} neighbourhood of Fallujah. [...] "The security forces have advanced from Naimiya neighbourhood to Shuhada," [...] Lieutenant General Abdel Wahab al-Saadi, the operation's overall commander, told AFP. On the same day, Shi'ite militias uncovered a 4 mi tunnel in Saqlawiyah, linking the town to Fallujah, which had been used by ISIL militants to stall the offensive and evade airstrikes. On 4 June, Iraqi forces captured the town of Saqlawiyah and stormed a neighborhood in southern Fallujah. A Coalition airstrike killed all the ISIL militants trying to escape from Saqlawiyah on a raft. According to reports, 70 ISIL terrorists were killed during the capture of Saqlawiyah, including several <b>foreign</b> <b>combatants.</b> By 5 June, Iraqi forces had secured {{the southern edge of}} Fallujah, capturing the Naymiah neighborhood. A leader of the Popular Mobilization Units said that part of the western bank was the only area of Fallujah's outskirts that hadn't been secured by pro-government forces. Iraqi forces captured the neighbourhood of Al-Shuhada Al-Thaniya on 8 June. Five members of the Iraqi security services were injured during the fighting on that day. The move to capture the outlying area went quickly and forced Islamic State fighters to retreat {{into the heart of the}} city, the spokesman, Sabah al-Noman, told state television. Government forces were regrouping before beginning their next advance, he added.On 10 June, Iraq's elite counter-terrorism service reportedly moved within three kilometers of central Fallujah, and consolidated positions in the south of the city.|$|R
5000|$|Rooney criticised Justin Amash in May, 2012, {{accusing the}} Michigan Republican {{of wanting to}} [...] "coddle foreign enemy combatants" [...] because he {{proposed}} {{an amendment to the}} National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to stop the military from indefinitely detaining suspected terrorists who were caught in the United States. Amash and Congressman Adam Smith said they worried about civil liberties and the constitutionality of allowing indefinite detention of U.S. residents suspected of being terrorists. A Rooney press release said that [...] "the Amash amendment sacrifices our national security in order to coddle <b>foreign</b> enemy <b>combatants.</b> Never in our nation’s history have we granted enemy combatants who attack our homeland during a time of war the same rights and privileges of American citizens, but that’s exactly what the Amash amendment would do."

40|$|Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that {{upheld the}} Universitry of Michigan law school’s affirmative action program (Barbara Grutter v. Lee Bollinger, et al). The {{decision}} was a stunning defeat for George W. Bush’s administration. After debating {{the legal and}} political merits of the filing a “friend of the Court ” (amicus curiae) brief, the Bush administration had taken a clear position against the Michigan programs. Indeed, in a nationally televised press conference, the President himself had described the University’s system as “divisive, unfair and impossible to square with the Constitution” (CNN, January 16 th, 2004). 1 A year later, the Bush administration’s conduct {{in the war on}} terrorism was directly challenged by the Court. In an 8 - 1 decision, the Court declared that citizens detained as “enemy combatants ” were entitled to due process and access to an attorney (Hamdi v. Rumsefeld). In another 6 - 3 decision, the Court ruled that <b>foreign</b> “enemy <b>combatants</b> ” held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba should be given access to U. S. Courts (Rasul et al. v. Bush). These three decisions illustrate the challenge presidents face in using the Courts to further their policy and political goals. Indeed, the Court dealt the Bush administratio...|$|R
40|$|Philippe Le Billon — Raw materials, {{violence}} and armed conflicts A number of armed {{conflicts in the}} third world are financed with raw materials. The relative importance of such income is on the increase, given the diminishing benefits of what is hereby termed as the geo-strategic rent of the cold war. The control of raw materials, territories and marketing networks now influence the strategies of armed groups, the process of conflicts and their resolution. It is however simplistic to qualify these as « resources wars », principally motivated by the cupidity of <b>combatants.</b> <b>Foreign</b> commercial interests and the state of dependency on raw materials, at times resulting in State delinquency, are just as important factors to take into account.

40|$|When {{it comes}} to foreign relations, the Roberts Court has trust issues. As far as the Court is concerned, {{everyone}} — the President, Congress, the lower courts, plaintiffs — has played hard and fast with the rules, {{taking advantage of the}} Court’s functionalist approaches to foreign affairs issues. This seems to be the message of the Roberts Court foreign affairs law jurisprudence. The Roberts Court has been active in foreign affairs law, deciding cases on the detention and trial of enemy <b>combatants,</b> <b>foreign</b> sovereign immunity, the domestic effect of treaties, the extraterritorial reach of federal statutes, the preemption of state laws, and the scope of the political question doctrine, among others. Looking back at those decisions, this Article notes and explores a stark and surprising trend. Across a string of decisions, from Hamdan v. Rumsfeld through Medellin v. Texas, Morrison v. National Australia Bank, Zivotofsky v. Clinton, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., and Bond v. United States, the Court has jettisoned its traditional foreign affairs functionalism in favor of formalism. The shift, as the Article explains, is not merely rhetorical or stylistic. Embedded within these opinions is a deep distrust of the Executive Branch, Congress, and the courts. And embraced by a surprising number of Justices across different wings of the Court, this formalism of distrust has brought constraints on the discretion of federal government deeper and more powerful than have been seen in some time. Foreign affairs formalism,with all of its implications, is the new reality — one that must be understood and watched...|$|R
