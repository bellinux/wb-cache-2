50|$|TR Bull {{developed}} an <b>electrogustometer,</b> but it lacked precision {{and was not}} widely accepted. In the 1990s the Rion (TR-06) was developed. This was precise and is widely used in the market. The TR-06 is probably the only <b>electrogustometer</b> used now for research and diagnosis. This is manual and needs a trained doctor or nurse to use it. It needs to be manually calculated {{to arrive at the}} taste threshold and carry out the false positive tests.|$|E
50|$|Electrogustometric taste {{threshold}} {{depends on}} pulse duration pulse and {{area of contact}} of electrode and tongue. Detailed experiments will be performed to prove and discuss their influence on taste threshold with the automatic <b>electrogustometer.</b> Experiments have been performed with the manual TR-06 on to {{study the effects of}} these control factors.|$|E
40|$|Background and ObjectivesZZThe aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{gustatory}} function be-tween age-matched men and women in Korean subjects. Subjects and MethodZZHealthy non-smoking volunteers without smell and taste disorders were investigated. Thirty-nine men and women of the same age group were evaluated for gus-tatory function. Whole mouth taste test was performed with successive solutions of sucrose, so-dium chloride, citric acid, and quinine hydrochloride. The electrical taste thresholds were mea-sured using an <b>electrogustometer</b> for four different sites in the oral cavity, i. e., both sides of anterior and posterior tongue. ResultsZZFemale subjects had lower mean values of detection and recognition thresholds fo...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} electrogustometry {{having been in}} {{existence}} since the 1930 s, there is no {{state of the art}} instrument to assess the electrogustometric threshold. A state of the art <b>electrogustometer</b> has been designed and constructed and tested for reliability and repeatability. This is based on embedded digital technology and is a semi-automatic, battery-powered portable instrument. Physical factors such as electrode area and stimulus duration affect the taste threshold but there are no recommended standards for these factors. Studies have been conducted to ascertain a recommended standard – a circular stainless steel electrode area of 28. 5 mm 2 and a stimulus duration of 2 seconds. While performing the test-retest assessment of the Sussex <b>Electrogustometer,</b> the new instrument, an anomaly was observed. Upon further investigation it was concluded that it was caused by alcohol consumed by a subject prior to the retest. Elaborate experiments were designed {{with the help of a}} neurologist and psychologist to understand the immediate effect of alcohol on taste for non-alcoholics. The results indicated an immediate improvement of taste for lower concentrations of alcohol and a delayed improvement for higher concentration. The studies were extended to understand the immediate effect of anaesthetics and smoking on taste which showed that taste deteriorated as expected. The new machine was used successfully in the clinical environment by local doctors and a report on their findings has also been included within this thesis.

40|$|No {{standardised}} method for taste threshold measurement is available and therefore comparison between clinical studies is difficult. An <b>electrogustometer</b> was evaluated in normal subjects. No sex difference in taste threshold was noted; however, {{there was a}} significant elevation in detection threshold with age and smoking. Electrogustometric values both in patients before and after surgery for trigeminal neuralgia and in patients with trigeminal sensory neuropathy were determined. Many patients with trigeminal nerve disorders had abnormal electrogustometric detection thresholds suggesting that there is possibly an accessory taste pathway through the trigeminal nerve, although in some individuals the site of lesion may be in the brain stem. Electrogustometry is a convenient method for clinically assessing taste...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} biomedical experiments {{conducted by the}} fi rst Polish cosmonaut, Maj. Mirosław Hermaszewski, with consideration being paid to the conditions and scientifi c importance of the experiments. Three experiments developed by Polish rese-archers, titled “Zdrowie ” (“Health”), “Kardiolider ” (“Cardioleader”) and “Smak ” (“Taste”) are presented in detail. Names of the researchers and designers planning the biomedical experiments to be conducted on board of the SALYUT 6 station {{as well as the}} names of the designers of the physiotest, cardioleader and <b>electrogustometer</b> devices are also mentioned. This article is documentary in nature, and its objective is to present the achievements of the Military Institute of Aviation Medicine (MIAM) in the fi eld of space medicine. biomedical experiments during orbital fl ights, physiotest, cardioleader, electrogustomete...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{cross-sectional}} study design aimed {{to determine the}} prevalence of Chorda Tympani Nerve (CTN) injury and related symptoms following myringoplasty. Thirty patients were included in this study. The methods used were measuring taste thresholds using <b>electrogustometer</b> to map taste threshold on the anterior two-third of the tongue on the operated side with the non operated side as the control. Reading is taken when the subject experiences sour/metallic taste. All corresponding threshold values and findings were recorded and compared to control. Results showed 50 % of patients had elevated threshold levels suggestive of CTN injury. However, none of the patients reported subjective taste loss. This study concludes that the prevelance rate of CTN injury in post myringoplasty patients is about 50 % {{but this is not}} associated with altered taste sensation...|$|E
