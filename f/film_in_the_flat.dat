40|$|Reactive mesogens (RMs) are polymerisable liquid {{crystals}} {{that can}} be formed {{through the process of}} in-situ photopolymerisation into thin birefringent films. These films have found applications as optical <b>films</b> (retarders) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> panel display industry. Application of the birefringent films requires homogeneous orientation of the optical axis over the film’s surface. We report high quality fast photoalignment of reactive mesogens on surfaces of cellulose-cinnamate polymers. Unique photosensitivity of cellulose-cinnamates and high quality photo-orientation of reactive mesogenes on these polymers allow cellulose-cinnamates to be considered as promising materials for producing thin birefringent polymer films by roll-to-roll technology. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of epitaxial structures {{formed in}} solidification of liquid Au films on the Au(110) surface was studied by {{molecular dynamics simulation}} based on a many [...] body interatomic potential. The (1 x 2) reconstructed and smooth phase at the temperature T= 500 K, {{as well as a}} deconstructed and rough phase of the Au(110) substrate at T= 900 K, were investigated. The three [...] dimensional islands with the (111) oriented facets were formed in solidification of thinner liquid films. At the same time, the substrate below these islands underwent a weak faceting process. Conversely, the solidification of thicker liquid <b>films</b> resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>flat</b> solid <b>films.</b> <b>The</b> two surface phases of the Au(110) substrate induced different structure of these epitaxial solid films. The films were studied via construction of the Voronoi polyhedra, density profiles, and surface stress calculations.

40|$|The {{layout and}} the {{instrumentation}} of a facility for film cooling investigation is described. The injectant air is heated and the mainflow air remains {{at ambient temperature}} while the temperature ratio between the injectant and the main flow is simulated. The lift-off/attachment characteristics, the nature of streamwise penetration, and the lateral spreading of the injectant film for a discrete hole injection configuration in an accelerating turbine blade passage was studied. Though detailed studies of injectant <b>films</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of <b>flat</b> plates {{have been carried out}} by many researchers, little work has been done on the above topic for the case of actual blades. Many regions remain unexplored in this discrete hole cooling process which is considered promising for turbine blades. The instrumentation system has been geared to obtain details of flow and mixing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of the injection holes, including the upstream and the downstream regions. (Author...|$|R
