25|$|The mid-air {{incident}} occurred as flight attendants began to serve drinks onboard Flight 907. JA8904's 'Traffic Collision Avoidance System' (TCAS) sounded 20minutes after its departure as the jet climbed towards 39,000 feet. The DC-10, JA8546, cruised at 37,000 feet. The pilots of both planes had received {{instructions from the}}ir TCAS, but Flight 907 received conflicting instructions from the <b>flight</b> <b>controller</b> at the Tokyo Area Control Center in Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture. Flight 907, headed by 40-year-old pilot , followed an order to descend issued by the <b>flight</b> <b>controller</b> while Flight 958, headed by pilot , descended as instructed by the TCAS, meaning that both planes remained on a collision course.|$|E

The duration {{of operations for}} Space Shuttle <b>flight</b> <b>controllers</b> was short and time-critical. A failure on the Shuttle could leave <b>flight</b> <b>controllers</b> little time for talking, putting pressure on them to respond quickly to potential failures. The Space Shuttle <b>flight</b> <b>controllers</b> generally had limited capability to send commands to the shuttle for system reconfigurations.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>controllers</b> are {{personnel}} who aid space flight by working in such Mission Control Centers as NASA's Mission Control Center or ESA's European Space Operations Centre. <b>Flight</b> <b>controllers</b> work at computer consoles and use telemetry to monitor various {{technical aspects of}} a space mission in real time. Each controller {{is an expert in}} a specific area and constantly communicates with additional experts in the [...] "back room". The Flight Director, who leads the <b>flight</b> <b>controllers,</b> monitors the activities of a team of <b>flight</b> <b>controllers</b> and has overall responsibility for success and safety.|$|R
25|$|John W. Aaron (born 1943) is {{a former}} NASA {{engineer}} and was a <b>flight</b> <b>controller</b> during the Apollo program.

25|$|His first shift as a <b>flight</b> <b>controller</b> {{was during}} {{the launch of the}} {{unmanned}} Apollo 6. The launch {{turned out to be a}} memorable one, as two engines cut out on the second stage of the Saturn V booster less than five minutes after lift-off. Although the mission was not aborted, it was a challenging launch for the Flight Dynamics officer—the spacecraft diverged from its intended trajectory so severely that Greene was nearly forced to call an abort.|$|E
25|$|Some memoirs have {{revived the}} {{simmering}} controversy over who or what, exactly, {{was to blame}} for the overshoot, suggesting, for example, that Carpenter was distracted by the science and engineering experiments dictated by the flight plan and by the well-reported fireflies phenomenon. Yet fuel consumption and other aspects of the vehicle operation were, during Project Mercury, as much, if not more, the responsibility of the ground controllers. Moreover, hardware malfunctions went unidentified, while organizational tensions between the astronaut office and the <b>flight</b> <b>controller</b> office—tensions that NASA did not resolve until the later Gemini and Apollo programs—may account for much of the latter-day criticism of Carpenter's performance during his flight.|$|E
25|$|The airport, which {{normally}} {{should have been}} closed due to the severe conditions, was not declared closed as its management feared that this could cause a diplomatic incident. According to the news agency Interfax, the pilot was told that Smolensk North Airport was enveloped in thick fog and strongly advised against landing, but still he decided {{to continue with the}} original flight plan and attempt a landing. According to an interview with a <b>flight</b> <b>controller</b> Pavel Plusnin it was suggested to the pilot that he land at an alternative airfield in Moscow or Minsk. According to Plusnin, the pilot said, that he would attempt one approach, and if landing was not possible, he would then divert to another airfield.|$|E

25|$|The real Mission Control Center {{consisted}} of two control rooms located on {{the second and third}} floors of Building 30 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. NASA offered the use of the control room for filming, but Howard declined, opting instead to make his own replica from scratch. Production designer Michael Corenblith and set decorator Merideth Boswell were in charge of the construction of the Mission Control set at Universal Studios. The set was equipped with giant rear-screen projection capabilities and a complex set of computers with individual video feeds to all the <b>flight</b> <b>controller</b> stations. The actors playing the flight controllers were able {{to communicate with each other}} on a private audio loop. The Mission Control room built for the film was on the ground floor. One NASA employee, who was a consultant for the film, said that the set was so realistic that he would leave at the end of the day and look for the elevator before remembering he was not in Mission Control. By the time the film was made, the USS Iwo Jima had been scrapped, so her sister ship, the USS New Orleans, was used as the recovery ship instead.|$|E

40|$|In late 2006, the Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) at NASA {{began looking}} {{at ways to}} make {{training}} more efficient for the <b>flight</b> <b>controllers</b> who support the International Space Station. The average certification times for <b>flight</b> <b>controllers</b> spanned from 18 months to three years and the MOD, responsible for technical training, was eager to develop creative solutions that would reduce the time to 12 months. Additionally, previously trained <b>flight</b> <b>controllers</b> sometimes participated in more than 50 very costly, eight-hour integrated simulations before becoming certified. New trainees needed to gain proficiency with far fewer lessons and training simulations than their predecessors.
