500|$|When Belfast {{was first}} {{opened to the}} public, {{visitors}} were limited to the upper decks and forward superstructure. As of 2011, nine decks {{are open to the}} public. Access to the ship is via a walkway which connects the quarterdeck with the pedestrianised footpath on the south bank of the River Thames. The Imperial War Museum's guidebook to HMS Belfast divides the ship into three broad sections. The first of these, [...] "Life on board the ship", focuses on the experience of serving at sea. Restored compartments, some populated with dressed figures, illustrate the crew's living conditions and the ship's various facilities such as the sick bay, galley, laundry, chapel, mess decks and NAAFI. Since 2002, school and youth groups have been able to stay onboard Belfast overnight, sleeping in bunks on a restored 1950s mess deck. The second section, [...] "The inner workings", below the waterline and protected by the ship's armoured belt, contains core mechanical, electrical and communication systems. As well as the engine and boiler rooms, other compartments include the transmitting station (housing the ship's Admiralty Fire Control Table, a mechanical computer), the forward steering position and one of Belfasts six-inch shell rooms and magazines. The third section, [...] "Action stations", includes the upper deck and forward superstructure with the ship's armament, fire control, and command facilities. Areas open to the public include the operations room, Admiral's bridge and <b>gun</b> <b>direction</b> platform. During 2011, two of these areas were reinterpreted. The operations room was restored to its appearance during Exercise Pony Express, a large British-Australian-American joint exercise held off North Borneo in 1961. The reinterpretation included an interactive audio-visual plotting table. [...] In July 2011, the interior of Y Turret, the aftmost 6-inch turret, was redisplayed using audio-visual and atmospheric effects, seeking to evoke the experience of a gunner at the Battle of North Cape. To emphasise the range of the ship's armament, the forward six-inch guns of A and B Turrets are trained on the London Gateway service area on the M1 motorway, some 12.5 miles away on the outskirts of London. A 4-inch gun mount and a shell hoist are kept in working order and used during blank-firing demonstrations by the Wavy Navy re-enactment group. In addition to the various areas of the ship open to visitors, some compartments have been fitted out as dedicated exhibition space. Permanent exhibitions include [...] "HMS Belfast in War and Peace" [...] and [...] "Life at Sea". The cost of admission to HMS Belfast includes a multilingual audio guide.|$|E

2500|$|HMAS Anzac (D59) was a Battle class {{destroyer}} of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Named {{after the}} Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, the destroyer was commissioned in 1951. The ship served on two {{tours of duty}} during the Korean War, and attempts to distinguish herself from British ships led {{to the practice of}} red kangaroo symbols on Australian warships. During 1956, Anzac served during the Malayan Emergency. In 1960, a malfunction in the destroyer's <b>gun</b> <b>direction</b> equipment caused Anzac to fire directly on sister ship [...] during a gunnery exercise, with Tobruk left unrepairable. In 1961, the destroyer was reclassified as a training vessel. Anzac remained in service until 1974, and was sold for breaking a year later.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent salvoes {{from the}} raider were more accurate. The second, three-shell salvo {{destroyed}} Sydneys bridge and damaged her upper superstructure, including the <b>gun</b> <b>direction</b> control tower, wireless offices, and foremast. The fourth [...] gun was ready by this time, and all four began to fire: {{the third and}} fourth salvoes knocked the cruiser's [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] turrets out of action before they could fire a second time, and the fifth hit Sydney on the waterline in proximity to the forward engine room, although one shell hit high and destroyed the Walrus. Kormorans guns were aimed at Sydneys waterline and upper deck during the next three salvoes. After the sixth German salvo, Sydney resumed fire with her aft turrets: [...] "Y" [...] turret fired less than four times with little effect, but multiple shots from [...] "X" [...] turret struck Kormoran, damaging the raider's machinery spaces, wounding the sailors manning one of the guns, and starting a fire in an oil tank.|$|E
2500|$|Fifteen minutes later, {{the cruiser}} signalled, [...] "Show your secret sign". Detmers {{knew there was}} no chance of fooling Sydney for much longer, so ordered Kormorans {{disguise}} dropped, the German battle ensign raised, and for all weapons to commence firing. The raider's opening salvo bracketed the ship, while the next four salvoes destroyed Sydneys bridge, <b>gun</b> <b>direction</b> tower, forward turrets, and aircraft. Two torpedoes were launched simultaneously with the raider's attack, and the close proximity of the target allowed the use of lighter weapons to rake Sydneys flank and interfere with attempts to man the cruiser's secondary weapons. In contrast, Sydney was only able to fire a single full salvo before her forward turrets were knocked out, shells from which punched through Kormorans exhaust funnel and wireless room, and caused shrapnel wounds to two sailors. Kormorans gunners shifted their aim to Sydneys waterline with their next three salvoes. Sydney responded from her aft turrets: one damaged the raider's machinery spaces and started a fire in an oil tank, while the other fired only a few ineffective shells. Around the time of the eighth or ninth German salvo, one of Kormorans torpedoes struck Sydney forward of [...] "A" [...] turret, ripping a hole in her side and causing her to settle by the bow. After the torpedo hit, Sydney turned hard to port in what the Germans assumed was an attempt to ram, but the cruiser passed harmlessly aft.|$|E

40|$|Automated 3 D {{path and}} spray control {{planning}} of industrial painting robots for unknown target surfaces is desired to meet {{demands on the}} production system. In this thesis, an image acquisition and laser range scanning based method has been developed. The system utilizes the XY projection of {{the boundaries of the}} target surface to generate the gun trajectory 2 ̆ 7 s X and Y coordinates as well as the spray control. Z coordinates and <b>gun</b> <b>direction,</b> distance, and speed are generated based on the point cloud from the target that is acquired by the laser scanner. A simulation methodology was also developed which is capable of calculating the paint thickness across the target surface. Results have shown that the generated path could perform a full coverage on the target surface, while keeping the paint material waste at the minimum. Excellent paint thickness control could be achieved on 2 D and straight line sweep surfaces, while a satisfactory thickness is obtained on other 3 D arbitrary surfaces. Relationships among thickness, spray deposition profile, sampling roughness and geometric features of the target surfaces have been discussed to make this method more applicable in industry...|$|E

An RF gun {{capable of producing}} polarized electrons is an attractive electron source for the ILC or an electron-ion collider. Producing such a gun has proven elusive. The NEA GaAs photocathode needed for polarized electron production is damaged by the vacuum environment in an RF gun. Electron and ion back bombardment can also damage the cathode. These problems must be mitigated before producing an RF gun polarized electron source. In this paper we report continuing {{efforts to improve the}} vacuum environment in a normal conducting RF gun by cooling it with liquid nitrogen after a high temperature vacuum bake out. We also report on a design of a cathode preparation chamber to produce bulk GaAs photocathodes for testing in such a <b>gun.</b> Future <b>directions</b> are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} three {{problems of}} selecting optimal <b>gun</b> barrel <b>direction</b> (or those of selecting optimal semiaxis position) when firing an unguided artillery projectile {{on the assumption}} that the gun barrel semiaxis can move in a connected nonconvex cone having a non-smooth lateral surface and modelling visibility zone restrictions. In the first problem, the target is in the true horizon plane of the gun, the second and the third problems deal with some region of 3 D space. A distinctive feature of the models is that the objective functions are ϵ-Lipschitz ones. We have constructed a unified numerical method to solve these problems based on an algorithm of projecting a point onto ϵ-Lipschitz level function set. A computer program has been based on it. A series of numerical experiments on each problem has been carried out. App. 1. Comment: 26 pages, in Russian. 2 nd version adds minor correction...|$|R
