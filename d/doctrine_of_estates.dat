An analysis of three topics in property law - the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>estates</b> in land, landlord and tenant, and matrimonial property - reveals a lack of contextual awareness in the legal writing.

40|$|Peter Sparkes’ path-breaking text on {{land law}} has been rewritten with two aims in mind: to {{incorporate}} the seismic changes introduced by the Land Registration Act 2002,along with commonholds, the explosion of human rights jurisprudence, and the unremitting advance of judicial exposition; and to accommodate the author’s developing thinking on the structural aspects of the subject. The book opens {{with a series of}} shorter chapters each exploring a fundamental building block: registration; houses flats and commonholds; land, ownership and its transactional powers; social controls balanced by human rights to property; fragmentation by time (the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>estates),</b> divisions of ownership and proprietary rights. In terms of substantive chapters the book opens with discussion of the new transfer system [...] paper-based transfer alongside the evolution towards electronic conveyancing [...] and the consequent changes to the proof of registered titles and to the registration curtain. The new approach to adverse possession against registered titles has called for extended discussion, as has the authoritative elucidation of the concept of adverse possession in Pye. In terms of proprietary interests the fundamentals are seen as rights to transfer, beneficial interests under trusts which are overreachable, burdens which are endurable, leases, money charges such as mortgages which are redeemable, and the obligations enforcible within the neighbour principle [...] easements, covenants and positive covenants being treated as a semi-coherent whole. An attempt has been made to assist students by moving some of the more arcane learning later into the book or into separate chapters where these matters might be more readily ignored by a candidate concerned primarily to prepare for an examination.

40|$|The Realms of Ministry, Government and Household "House-Table"-Literature and the <b>Doctrine</b> <b>of</b> the Three <b>Estates</b> in the 16 th Century The House-Table (list of duties) is a {{combination}} of verses drawn from the Pauline Epistles and the Epistles of Peter, containing instructions on behavior suitable for the different estates. This compilation was introduced by Luther, who placed it {{at the conclusion of the}} Small Catechism he had written and published in 1529. Luther sequenced the Biblical verses according to the model of the three spheres of society: church, temporal authority/politics and household. This tripartition of society is referred to as Luther's <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> the three <b>estates</b> („Dreiständelehre“). It is a modification of the medieval social tripartition of clergyman, soldier, and peasant (resp. worker), making the <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> matrimony, as the centre of the household, an integral part of the pattern. Thus according to this model each person was a member of all three realms of social life simultaneously. This change was hardly noticed by contemporaries, not even by Luther himself. Nevertheless we can identify the high estimation of matrimony by Lutherans as one reason for the wide dissemination <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> the three <b>estates</b> among Lutheran ministers from the 1550 's onwards. This is because the <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> matrimony was opposed to the combated celibatarian estates, which were at variance with the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> justification. The instructions assigned to the estates according to the House-Table, propagating the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> the three <b>estates,</b> were spread as part of the Small Catechism as well as in many sermons, furthermore in poems, songs, and even in theatre plays. But it is only since the end of the 16 th century that laymen appear as authors of such texts. From this we can conclude that at least during the 16 th century the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> the three <b>estates</b> primarily represented a minister's perception of the world. The interpretations of the House-Table given by Hieronymus Weller (1552), Cyriacus Spangenberg (1556), Heinrich Roth (1573) and Aegidius Hunnius (1586) are discussed in detail in this thesis, with special attention paid to their reference to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> the three <b>estates.</b> There is one problem that arises in nearly all of the sermons: the relationship between the duty of obedience in general and the duty of disobedience in matters of faith. In other types of texts, like prayer books, interpretations of the Decalogue, exegesis of the Book of Ben Sira and even in the collection of specimens compiled by Andreas Hondorff, the House-Table is referred to as a structuring pattern. The use of the classification scheme of the House-Table within the text group formed by New Year sermons, printed since the end the 16 th century and hitherto hardly explored, is examined in more detail in this thesis. Another chapter is devoted to poetry inspired by the House-Table, which frequently appeared as New Year's Day bounties („Neujahrsgaben“) since the final third of the 16 th century, which notably, by then, were also written by laymen. Among these poems the New Year poem written by Elias Noricus in 1593 stands out. It comprehends more than 7, 000 verses and is most conspicuous for its multiplicity of specimens and the attribution of symbolic animals to the estates. Finally, two prints in dialogue form and two dramas based on the House-Table are examined, focusing on the scenic arrangement of the didactic source texts. The thesis closes with a glimpse of the subsequent development of the pattern based on the House-Table and the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> the three <b>estates</b> between the 17 th and 19 th centuries...|$|R
40|$|The {{future of}} {{property}} will {{be shaped by}} its capacity {{to adapt to the}} unfolding imperative of the 21 st century, the challenge of landscape sustainability. As a constantly evolving institution, property has adapted {{to meet the needs of}} pre-industrial, and industrial society, and again must conform to an unfolding era when society must re-learn the need to ‘live from the yield, but not from the substance’[1] to ensure long-term prosperity. Property in landscapes is inter-connected and inclusive, and not as private property defines it, fragmented and exclusive. Property needs to be ‘seen’[2] in its many diverse forms, where the sharp dichotomies of private and public are blurred, and the consequence of ‘viewing land through the lens of [an economy of nature is to] reduce the significance of property lines. ’[3] That such a view of property may enhance the potential for landscape sustainability is the proposition of this paper. The paper suggests an alternative articulation of property that: 1. Emphasises use rights with simultaneous multiple ‘owners’, rather than traditional <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> <b>estates</b> or interests in land, unitary ownership, and associated notions of exclusivity of possession; 2. Enables obligations, as a logical and necessary concomitant of rights; 3. Promotes a diversity of shared, multiple uses, rather than single use; 4. Blends the traditional distinctions between private, public and common property; 5. Encapsulates the desirable norms of private, public, and common property models, while mitigating their less desirable characteristics, and; 6. Results in a diverse, pluralistic, inter-connected network, or ‘mosaic’[4] of property rights, claims and uses. Our understanding of property has fundamental consequences for it’s relationship with external things, including landscapes and landscape resources, and how they are used and exploited. Articulating a sustainable paradigm for the institution of property is critical in an age of environmental consequence[5]. [1] Klaus Bosselmann, The Principle of Sustainability (2008) 22 [2] Carol M.

40|$|A real {{property}} law inglesa é um tema pouco estudado na tradição jurídica de base romanística, e menos ainda no Brasil. Mesmo a literatura comparatística tem minimizado, ou mesmo omitido, o estudo abrangente das fontes inglesas ao analisar o tema, resultando na ausência de trabalhos escritos desde uma perspectiva do direito privado continental que analisem com maior profundidade os principais elementos formativos dos direitos reais sobre bens imóveis de matriz inglesa. As referências e alusões ao sistema do common law, contudo, são hoje cada vez mais freqüentes nos ordenamentos de matriz civilística, principalmente em razão da maior interação entre ordenamentos pertencentes a sistemas jurídicos de tradição histórica diversa. Portanto, para estabelecer diálogos relevantes, deve-se dedicar atenção especial aos principais elementos de formação do sistema de direito inglês, de modo a desvendar sua particular estrutura e terminologia. O primeiro passo para estabelecer esse diálogo é conhecer os elementos que deram origem ao sistema do common law. Dado o forte vínculo do direito inglês com a sua história, torna-se necessário o estudo da {{real property}} law por meio de uma análise das suas fontes históricas que revele tanto a estrutura conceitual quanto o sentido das expressões e dos institutos mais típicos do sistema do common law. É esse estudo que pretendemos realizar neste trabalho, mediante a análise da formação histórica das tenures, dos estates, da equity e dos trusts. Uma pesquisa baseada nas fontes relativas à formação da real property law traz a vantagem adicional de fornecer uma visão ampla acerca da natureza e o funcionamento do sistema do common law como um todo, na medida em que o desenvolvimento primário do direito inglês esteve associado à estrutura dos direitos reais sobre bens imóveis na Inglaterra. Desse contexto derivam, em larga medida, as particularidades e as características que tornam o sistema do common law, em muitos aspectos, diverso dos sistemas jurídicos de tradição romanística. A busca por uma aproximação entre os sistemas pertencentes a essas duas tradições jurídicas exige uma compreensão dos elementos que deram origem à diversidade entre elas. Nossa proposta é, justamente, identificar esses elementos e torná-los compreensíveis desde uma perspectiva civilística, por meio de uma análise das fontes inglesas mais relevantes para o tema. English real property {{law is not}} a subject very often studied in the legal tradition based on Roman law, and even less so in Brazil. Even comparative writers have tended to minimize, if not altogether omit, a comprehensive study of the English sources when discussing the subject, resulting in a lack of literature, written {{from the perspective of}} continental private law, that analyses in greater depth the main formative elements of the law of real property based on the English legal model. The references and allusions to the common law legal system, however, have become increasingly more frequent in civil law contexts, largely due to the greater degree of interaction between legal systems belonging to different historical traditions. Thus, in order to establish meaningful dialogues, special attention must be given to the main factors that shaped the English legal system, thereby unveiling its specific structure and terminology. The firs step towards establishing such a dialogue is to understand the elements that gave birth to the common law legal system. Given the strong connection English law has with its history, it is necessary to study the real property law through an analysis of its historical sources, which will reveal the conceptual structure and the meaning of the most typical expressions and institutions of the English legal system. That is the task undertaken herein, to be accomplished through the study of the historical inception of the doctrine of tenures, the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>estates,</b> equity and trusts. A study based on the sources regarding the formation of the real property law brings the additional advantage of providing a broad outlook on the nature and operation of the English legal system as a whole, as the primary development of English law was associated to the structure of rights over land in England. That context is the cause, to a large extent, of the peculiarities and characteristics that make the English legal system, in many ways, different from legal systems based on Roman law. The pursuit for a closer interaction between the legal systems that belong to those two legal traditions requires an understanding of the elements that determined their differences. The object of this research is to identify those elements and make them comprehensible from a civilian perspective, by means of an analysis of the most relevant English sources on the subject...|$|E

No attempt will be made in this short article to analyze or even explain all of these complexities.

40|$|The {{planning}} {{system that}} was formalised in Britain in the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act is distinctive for {{the way in which}} it explicitly nationalised the rights to future development and distinguished between physical development and land-use change. Contingent causes for these characteristics can be found in the experience of planning in the first half of the 20 th century which in turn was developed from sanitary legislation of the 19 th century. There are, however, more fundamental reasons for the way in which the British planning system was constituted. In this paper I argue that the nationalisation of development rights and the separation of land use from building have their conceptual roots in medieval property law. As a colonial state in the period after the Norman Conquest, England saw the imposition of feudal law in its purest form. In such a system, owners of land were denied absolute rights to property of the kind available under Roman law and its derivatives. Legal theorists developed the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> the <b>estate</b> which gave concrete existence to the limited rights of all those with an interest in a given parcel of land (those with tenure). Present and future rights to use could be distinguished. This conceptualising of property interest was to have profound consequences not only for property relations but also for the emerging planning system in the 20 th century. It created a system which gave the state unprecedented control over changes to land, but which also had some significant disadvantages. ...|$|R

Since the problem concerns the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as stated by the New Testament writers, John and Paul, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole, it is necessary to consider several definite facts.

In order to correctly understand either John or Paul 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin it is first necessary to review the Bible teaching regarding man in relation to sin.
