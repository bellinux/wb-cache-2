40|$|In {{order to}} grasp the imaginative {{geographical}} and historical scope of contemporary Indian writing in English, this thesis claims {{that it is necessary}} to think about literature beyond the paradigms of national, postcolonial or even transnational diasporic literatures. It is asserted that cosmopolitanism, which is here understood to be a concept that encompasses the negotiation of the ethics and practice of migration, community, responsibility, difference and sameness, offers the possibility of thinking critically about migration and globalization in the context of the literary texts at the centre of this thesis: Amitav Ghosh’s Sea of Poppies (2008) and River of Smoke (2011), Salman Rushdie’s The Enchantress of Florence (2007) and M. G. Vassanji’s The Assassin’s Song (2007). Literary criticism has acknowledged the relevance of cosmopolitan thought in contemporary literatures of a <b>global,</b> transnational <b>literary</b> <b>imaginary.</b> Yet the literature concerned with cosmopolitanism has, with a few exceptions, mainly used it as a descriptive rather than as an interpretative term, focusing on the politics of these fictional texts rather than on their aesthetics or in this case, to be more precise, their literary features. In this thesis, the interest is to examine the ethics, practice and aesthetics of cosmopolitan moments in which histories and geographies are rewritten and reimagined, i. e. the propensity of these four novels to remap, rethink and reimagine these narratives of time and space according to an understanding that moves away from postcolonial dichotomies towards a more global view of events that still takes into account existing power relations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Going {{as far as}} {{to discuss}} {{political}} violence and funerals alongside poetry and theatre, this article adopts an inclusive approach to culture and explores the changing nature of performance in 1980 s South Africa. Focusing initially on trade unions and worker culture, before widening the discussion, it is shown that those marginalised by apartheid society were able to work at the boundaries of established genres to perform messages of mobilisation that simultaneously created temporarily liberated areas inscribed with new forms of authority and agency. The article considers poetry by Alfred Qabula and Mzwakhe Mbuli; new developments in theatre; and fundamentally political events and argues that each, by blurring the distinction between performer and audience, similarly acted as popular tools of communication. They replaced the <b>literary</b> <b>imaginary</b> of previous decades and created new public space...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} symbolic presence of medieval forms of textual selfhood in early modern English Petrarchan poetry. Undertaking a systematic re-reading {{of a significant}} body of English Petrarchism {{through the prism of}} late medieval English poetry, it argues that medieval poetic texts inscribe in the vernacular <b>literary</b> <b>imaginary</b> (i. e. a repository of discursive forms and identities available to early modern writers through antecedent and contemporaneous literary utterances) a network of recognizable and iterable discursive structures and associated subject positions; and that various linguistic and ideological traces of these medieval discourses and selves can be discovered in early modern English Petrarchism. Each of the four chapters traces medieval genealogies of a distinct scenario of subjectivity deployed by English Renaissance Petrarchism. The first chapter considers the significance of William Langland’s poetics of meed (reward) for the anti-laureate and anti-courtly identities assumed by Thomas Wyatt in his Petrarchan poems and by Edmund Spenser in the Amoretti. The second chapter examines the persistence of vernacular melancholy (encapsulated in Geoffrey Chaucer’s Book of the Duchess) in the verse of Henry Howard, earl of Surrey and in Philip Sidney’s Astrophil and Stella. The poetics of melancholy engenders a fragmented subjectivity that manifests itself through a series of quasi-theatrical performances of identity, as well as an ambivalent form of poetic discourse in which the production of Petrarchism is carried out alongside its radical critique. The focus of chapter three is the master trope of royal incarceration and its function as a mechanism of subject formation in the poetry of James I Stewart, Charles of Orleans, Mary Stewart, and Lady Mary Wroth. As the dissertation argues, the figure of an imprisoned sovereign is a crucial ideologeme of the pre-modern English political and <b>literary</b> <b>imaginary,</b> underwriting the poetics and politics of royal identity from Sir John Fortescue to James VI/I. Lastly, the fourth chapter investigates medieval genealogies of the subject afflicted with a malady of desire in Shakespeare’s sonnets, by tracing its inchoate vernacular precedents back to the poems of Thomas Hoccleve (La Male Regle) and Robert Henryson (The Testament of Cresseid). 1 yea...|$|R

40|$|The {{significance}} of gender to {{depictions of the}} nation is a significant discussion within African fiction. Guinea-Bissau, however, has been somewhat neglected. This thesis will re-dress this imbalance by juxtaposing Abdulai Sila’s Mistida trilogy with fiction by Filomena Embaló, Domingas Samy and Odete Semedo. It considers the symbolic representations of women in Sila’s work, where he writes the colonised nation upon the female body, and attempts to create women’s agency by inscribing them with future power. However he simultaneously eradicates their historical importance. I explore the narratives of female-authored fiction and argue that whilst {{there is a tendency}} to write about inequality in the domestic space, women are equally concerned with discussing national identity and experience through the prism of the intimate. I revisit Sila to examine the {{significance of}} masculinities to his narration of the nation. He repeatedly complicates the image of a national hero in texts that connect Guinea-Bissau to global black masculinities and inscribe the crises of the post-independence nation upon the male body. Insofar as the <b>literary</b> <b>imaginary</b> contributes to the construction of nationhood in Guinea-Bissau, this thesis demonstrates that the negotiation of gender symbolism and power relations are intrinsic to this process in fiction...|$|R
