50|$|In marketing, {{a fighter}} brand (sometimes called a <b>fighting</b> <b>brand)</b> is a lower-priced {{offering}} launched {{by a company}} to take on, and ideally take out, specific competitors that are attempting to under-price them. Unlike traditional brands that are designed with target consumers in mind, fighter brands are created specifically to combat a competitor that is threatening to take market share away from a company's main brand.|$|E
50|$|On March 17 of {{the year}} 3019 in the Third Age, Sauron sent a host of Easterlings to attack Dale. The {{combined}} forces of the Men of Dale under King Brand and the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain under King Dáin Ironfoot marched out to meet the Easterlings in battle. Sauron's forces were probably more numerous, though the armies of Dale and Erebor would have possessed an advantage due to their superior Dwarven-made weaponry. After three days of heavy close-quarters <b>fighting,</b> <b>Brand</b> and Dáin were forced to retreat to the Lonely Mountain. A few sturdy warriors led by Brand and Dáin fought bravely before the Gate of Erebor, which was not taken. Dáin was killed as he stood defending the body of his ally Brand. The defenders of the Mountain were now under siege.|$|E
50|$|These {{strategies}} {{are defined as}} actions or decisions that companies take {{in order to protect}} their position in the market environment from potential firms that have already entered to the industry and can take the market share away. Those actions include defending position before competitors become established, introducing <b>fighting</b> <b>brands,</b> and adopting cross-parry strategies.|$|R
50|$|Fighting brands are {{implemented}} by enterprises {{to fight a}} competitor’s brand that threatens one of their major brands. Competing brands are usually lower costs versions of the firm’s premium brands that call for same quality at a lower price. Introducing <b>fighting</b> <b>brands</b> can be an attractive strategy because they help fight off a price-cutting brand that is threatening the core brand of the company while conserving its important image and profitability.|$|R
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of <b>fighting</b> <b>brands</b> is to {{challenge}} competitor brands. For example, Qantas, Australia's largest flag carrier airline, introduced Jetstar to go head-to-head against the low-cost carrier, Virgin Australia (formerly known as Virgin Blue). Jetstar is an Australian low-cost airline for budget conscious travellers, but it receives many negative reviews due to this. The launching of Jetstar allowed Qantas to rival Virgin Australia without the criticism being affiliated with Qantas because of the distinct brand name.|$|R
5000|$|Amongst many {{marketing}} angles, the 'Southern man' {{campaign has}} been significantly popular and long running. One television advertisement featured the Cardrona Hotel pub. Speight's later opened a loose replica of this building in Mt Eden, Auckland {{as part of its}} marketing scheme. The Speight's brand was removed in August 1960 and replaced with the Lucky brand. However, the public response was less than favourable, so the Speight's brand was brought back into production in October of that year. Speight's is the <b>fighting</b> <b>brand</b> of Lion Nathan in New Zealand. Speight's distinctive label features three eight-pointed stars. These stars come from both the original provincial arms of Otago, and the fact that Speight's was awarded gold medals at the 1877 Brewery awards in three different countries. Speight's has used the slogan [...] "Pride of the south" [...] for many years.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{tackle the}} dilemma of pruning versus {{proliferation}} in a vertically differentiated oligopoly {{under the assumption that}} some firms collude and control both the range of variants for sale and their corresponding prices, likewise a multiproduct firm. We analyse whether pruning emerges and, if so, a <b>fighting</b> <b>brand</b> is marketed. We find that it is always more profitable for colluding firms to adopt a pricing strategy such that some variants are withdrawn from the market. Under pruning, these firms commercialize a <b>fighting</b> <b>brand</b> only when facing competitors in a low-end market. The same findings do not hold when firms are horizontally differentiated along a circle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Exclusionary {{conduct in}} two-sided markets with [indirect] network effects is {{investigated}} in this dissertation. The dissertation addresses these issues by making three main contributions. First, a profitability function for independent South African community newspaper businesses is quantified {{and used to}} consider the effectiveness of possible exclusionary strategies. For exclusionary conduct to be an attractive mechanism for a dominant firm it must undermine the ability of independent newspapers to be effective competitors such as through reducing their revenue by inducing customers not to deal with them, and/or raising their costs {{such as those of}} printing. In other instances, exclusionary conduct may be used to artifically raise entry costs by raising barriers to entry associated with building a credible readership base. Second, the economics of different types of conduct are assessed based on a critical evaluation of competition cases. These include, in particular, the <b>fighting</b> <b>brand</b> predatory pricing strategy, in the presence of product/customer differentiation and as applied to the economic characteristics of community newspapers, notably their two-sided nature. Third, given South Africa’s history and high levels of concentration, the dissertation considers the appropriate standards to be applied in competition law enforcement to ensure a fair environment for the participation of small businesses and those owned by historically disadvantaged individuals. It is found that the application of competition policy in assessing exclusionary conduct is skewed in favour of incumbent firms, particularly in the case of predatory pricing cases, because the economics of exclusionary conduct are inappropriately translated into legal tests. The conclusion is that the average variable cost or marginal cost measure specified in the law and the ‘as efficient’ competitor standard applied for assessing exclusionary below-cost pricing do not afford sufficient protection for small firms and provides leeway for dominant incumbents to engage in succesful exclusionary strategies.

40|$|Firms selling {{multiple}} quality-differentiated products frequently {{alter their}} product lines when a competitor enters the market. We present {{a model of}} multiproduct monopoly and duopoly using a general `upgrades` approach that yields a powerful analytical framework. We provide a simple theoretical explanation for the common strategies of using `fighting brands` and of product line `pruning`. We also present a general condition that guarantees that a monopolist will forsake market segmentation opportunities and sell but a single product. A number of previously studied issues can be addressed by our model, including inter-temporal price discrimiation and `damaged goods`. multiproduct quality competition, <b>fighting</b> <b>brands,</b> product line pruning, focus on quality, price discrimination...|$|R
50|$|This {{approach}} usually {{results in}} higher promotion costs and advertising. This {{is due to}} the company being required to generate awareness among consumers and retailers for each new brand name without the benefit of any previous impressions. Multibranding strategy has many advantages. There is no risk that a product failure will affect other products in the line as each brand is unique to each market segment. Although, certain large multiband companies have come across that the cost and difficulty of implementing a multibranding strategy can overshadow the benefits. For example, Unilever, the world's third-largest multination consumer goods company recently streamlined its brands from over 400 brands to centre their attention onto 14 brands with sales of over 1 billion euros. Unilever accomplished this through product deletion and sales to other companies. Other multibrand companies introduce new product brands as a protective measure to respond to competition called <b>fighting</b> <b>brands</b> or fighter brands.|$|R

5000|$|Brent was {{nominated}} for [...] "Sexiest Female" [...] at the 2001 British Soap Awards, for her portrayal. Merle Brown of the Daily Record has been critical of Gina. Initially enjoying her storylines, she grew tired of the character. She said that The Patrick family became a mess and said Hollyoaks was [...] "unmissable" [...] when Gina suffered an identity crisis. When Gina lost the college election because of her sexuality, Brown {{said that it was}} [...] "not nice" [...] but added that it was probably true. She later became annoyed that Gina and Emily began <b>fighting.</b> She <b>branded</b> the storyline as [...] "nonsense" [...] and questioned why they ever bothered to begin a relationship. She later said they [...] "spend most of their life fighting" [...] and jested that blokes would much prefer them to do it [...] "naked in mud." [...] By 2001, Brown could not stand to watch Gina any longer. She said she hoped she would leave with Sol or be murdered by pimp Steve. In the book The media : an introduction, Adam Briggs and Paul Cobley said that by 2001 homosexual relationships in soap opera were no longer a novelty. They said Gina and Emily's relationship was a notable example.|$|R
5000|$|Boxeur Des Rues {{literally}} means [...] "street <b>fighting</b> boxer". The <b>brand</b> {{is inspired}} by the world of Savate, the French boxing born by the fusion of traditional western boxing techniques and oriental Martial arts, that was learned by French sailors returning from the various ports of Far East and Southeast Asia {{at the beginning of}} the XIX century. Subsequently, these techniques merged with each other, evolving and beginning to be used in frequent street raids. Later in Marseille, the most important and toughest European port, numerous illegal combat circles (the [...] "Fight Clubs") were born with a large round of betting around them. From here the name [...] "Boxeur Des Rues": true sportsmen, born and raised on the streets. The brand is actually an expression of the fusion of [...] "streetwear" [...] and [...] "sportswear".|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} article is to find out whether attitudes toward national brand promotions and store brands have similar or different conceptual antecedents. The study presents and tests a model of the effects of shoppers´ characteristics (price and non-price-related) on attitudes toward store brand and national brand promotions. The results support that constructs relating to price impact both store brand attitude and national brand promotion attitude, but the strength of some of these relationships differ.

50|$|In 1993, Nintendo {{announced}} plans {{to develop a new}} 64-bit console codenamed Project Reality that would be capable of rendering fully 3D environments and characters. In 1994, Nintendo also claimed that Project Reality would be renamed Ultra 64 in the US. The Ultra 64 moniker was unveiled in arcades on the Nintendo <b>branded</b> <b>fighting</b> game Killer Instinct and the racing game Cruisin' USA. Killer Instinct was later released on the SNES. Soon after, Nintendo realized they had mistakenly chosen a name for their new console that the Konami corporation owned the rights to. Specifically, only Konami would have the rights to release games for the new system called Ultra Football, Ultra Tennis, etc. Therefore, in 1995 Nintendo changed the final name of the system to the Nintendo 64, and announced that it would be released in 1996. They later showed previews of the system and several games, including Super Mario 64, to the media and public. 1995 is also the year that Nintendo purchased part of Rare.|$|R
5|$|Nine {{professional}} wrestling matches {{were scheduled}} for the event, which featured a supercard, a scheduling {{of more than one}} main bout. The first of these matches was a Singles match from the SmackDown brand that featured The Undertaker defeating World Heavyweight Champion Edge to win the title. The second was a Triple Threat match from the Raw brand, in which WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated challengers Triple H and John Cena to retain the championship. The other was a singles match from the ECW brand, in which Kane defeated ECW Champion Chavo Guerrero to win the ECW title. From the six scheduled bouts on the undercard, three received more promotion than the others. In a No Disqualification match, Floyd Mayweather Jr. defeated Big Show. The second match involved wrestlers from all three <b>brands</b> <b>fighting</b> in a Money in the Bank ladder match, which CM Punk won. The other match was a retirement match in which Shawn Michaels defeated Ric Flair, leading to Flair's departure from the WWE and a period of retirement from active wrestling.|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{two issues}} in {{operations}} management. The {{first one is}} the impact of counterfeits and strategies of <b>fighting</b> counterfeits for <b>brand</b> name companies, which includes two parts, and the second one is the effect of timing of payments in a joint replenishment and pricing control problem. Counterfeiting is a widely spread phenomenon and has seen rapid growth in recent years. All counterfeits can be divided into two categories, non-deceptive and deceptive, depending on whether consumers can recognize them when making a purchase. In the first part, we focus on how non-deceptive counterfeits affect the price, market share and profitability of brand name products. We also consider the strategies for brand name companies to fight non-deceptive counterfeits, compare different fighting strategies in a market with one brand name product and its counterfeit, and derive equilibrium fighting strategies in a market with two competing brand name products and a counterfeit under general conditions. In the second part, we focus on how deceptive counterfeits affect a brand name manufacturer’s profit and supply chain structure. In a market with deceptive counterfeits, the brand name manufacturer should consider protective strategies on its supply chain to avoid being penetrated by counterfeits. We analyze a brand name manufacturer’s optimal decision on whether to establish a reliable distribution channel, decentralized or centralized, to guarantee 100 % authenticity, and whether to sell through the general channel having been penetrated by counterfeits. We also compare the profit from a centralized reliable channel to the one from a decentralized one. In the third part, we consider the joint replenishment and pricing control problem in a periodic review system in which consumers pay upon receiving their goods and unmet demand is lost if not filled in the following period, referred to as conditional backlogging. We show that a base-stock list price policy is optimal in the case without a fixed ordering cost, and provide a sufficient condition for an (st, St, pt) policy to be optimal in the case with a positive fixed ordering cost. We also compare this system to the one where customers pay upon arrival analytically and numerically...|$|R
