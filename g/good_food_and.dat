The raiding party brought back samples of <b>good</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> fine worksmanship, and a report that the Humans were defenseless. The Orcs' raiding parties grew larger and bolder, until they assaulted Azeroth's principal castle. However, the Humans had been training warriors of their own, especially the mounted, heavily armed Knights. These, assisted by Human Sorcerers, gradually forced the Orcs to retreat through the portal, which the Humans had not discovered.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} abroad, Cooper {{stayed with the}} Countess Dorothy di Frasso at the Villa Madama in Rome, where she taught him about <b>good</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> vintage wines, how to read Italian and French menus, and how to socialize among Europe's nobility and upper classes. After guiding him through the great art museums and {{galleries}} of Italy, she accompanied him on a ten-week big-game hunting safari {{on the slopes of}} Mount Kenya in East Africa, where he was credited with over sixty kills, including two lions, a rhinoceros, and various antelopes. His safari experience in Africa had a profound influence on Cooper and intensified his love of the wilderness. After returning to Europe, he and the countess set off on a Mediterranean cruise of the Italian and French Rivieras. Rested and rejuvenated by his year-long exile, a healthy Cooper returned to Hollywood in April 1932 and negotiated a new contract with Paramount for two films per year, a salary of $4,000 a week, and director and script approval.|$|E

25|$|A fastidious dresser, Caruso took {{at least}} two baths a day and enjoyed <b>good</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> convivial company. He forged a {{particularly}} close bond with his Met and Covent Garden colleague Antonio Scotti– an amiable and stylish baritone from Naples. Caruso was superstitious and habitually carried several good-luck charms {{with him when he}} sang. He played cards for relaxation and sketched friends, other singers and musicians. His wife, Dorothy said that by the time she knew him, her husband's favorite hobby was compiling scrapbooks. He also amassed a valuable collection of rare postage stamps, coins, watches and antique snuffboxes. Caruso was a heavy smoker of strong Egyptian cigarettes, too.

25|$|Back in Venice, Casanova {{started his}} {{clerical}} law career and was admitted as an abbé after being conferred minor orders by the Patriarch of Venice. He shuttled {{back and forth}} to Padua to continue his university studies. By now, he had become something of a dandy—tall and dark, his long hair powdered, scented, and elaborately curled. He quickly ingratiated himself with a patron (something he was to do all his life), 76-year-old Venetian senator Alvise Gasparo Malipiero, the owner of Palazzo Malipiero, close to Casanova's home in Venice. Malipiero moved in the best circles and taught young Casanova a great deal about <b>good</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> wine, and how to behave in society. However, Casanova was caught dallying with Malipiero's intended object of seduction, actress Teresa Imer, and the senator drove both of them from his house. Casanova's growing curiosity about women led to his first complete sexual experience, with two sisters, Nanetta and Marton Savorgnan, then fourteen and sixteen, who were distant relatives of the Grimanis. Casanova proclaimed that his life avocation was firmly established by this encounter.|$|E
