500|$|Kaling {{used her}} own Indian {{cultural}} background as inspiration when writing the episode, which portrays the Indian festival of Diwali. She and her friend, My Name Is Earl writer Vali Chandrasekaran, had held a Diwali party in 2005 for {{the cast of}} their two shows. According to Kaling, NBC was [...] "so excited. They were like, 'What the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> holiday? I've never heard of it'." [...] The following year, while discussing the possible creation of a Halloween episode, she and executive producer Greg Daniels agreed to instead create one that was Diwali-themed, as the two holidays fall near each other.|$|E
500|$|In San Diego, Konnan met John Roberts. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter then details Ashenoff's {{first foray}} in to {{professional}} wrestling: [...] "Carlos traveled to Tijuana on Wednesday, January 6, 1988, (his 24th birthday), {{where he was}} led to the dressing area and introduced to Manuel de los Santos, the promoter of the show, and who also wrestled in the main event as “Kiss.” De los Santos {{took one look at}} the 215-pound bodybuilder and did the classic double-take –– what the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> guy doing here, and, how quickly can I get this guy in the ring. Konnan introduced himself and explained how he was brought here by his manager/agent, John Roberts. Roberts had already bragged to de los Santos that Carlos had been a wrestler in Florida. Suddenly, a big roar (laughter) went up from another wrestler, Miguel Lopez, who wrestled as Rey Mysterio. Lopez/Mysterio explained to Carlos that Roberts was just a nutty fan, always in the front row, but that he did nothing involved with managing or agent-ing or anything else in the business. Still, the wrestlers asked Carlos, want to give it a try?" [...] Billed as El Centurión ("The Centurion"), Ashenoff debuted for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) on January 6, 1988.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} February, Růžičková and {{the other}} laborers were transported to the horrific death camp of Bergen-Belsen. She would later say of Bergen-Belsen:"If ever there <b>was</b> <b>Hell,</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the lowest part of <b>Hell.</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> an {{extermination}} camp—it was really meant for us to die in." ...|$|R

500|$|Vedder called [...] "Gonna See My Friend" [...] a [...] "drug song," [...] but {{elaborated}} {{that the}} song is about {{going to see a}} friend to stay off drugs, and he stated that [...] "Got Some" [...] is about a [...] "drug dealer," [...] but added what the drug the dealer is selling is actually a great rock song. [...] "Johnny Guitar", described by Vedder as [...] "almost an Elvis Costello homage", had its lyrics inspired by a collage of album covers that is pasted on the bathroom wall of the band's rehearsal space. Vedder noticed the album cover for Johnny [...] "Guitar" [...] Watson's 1979 album, What the <b>Hell</b> <b>Is</b> <b>This?,</b> and imagined a man who becomes attracted to one of the various women on the cover and then wonders why this woman would rather be one of Watson's many girlfriends instead of his only one. Vedder described [...] "Just Breathe" [...] as [...] "as close to a love song as we've ever gotten," [...] and said that the subject of {{the song is}} the happiest times of people's lives when they should just take in the moment and [...] "breathe for a minute." [...] He also said that [...] "Unthought Known" [...] concerns the human psyche, and [...] "Supersonic" [...] is about the love for music. According to Vedder, [...] "Speed of Sound" [...] is a song taken {{from the perspective of a}} man who is still sitting in a bar after everyone else has left, but he added that even though the song is sad it became more [...] "confident" [...] when played with the whole band. He said [...] "Force of Nature" [...] is [...] "about the strength of one person in the relationship, when they can withstand some of the faults in another." [...] "The End" [...] has been described as an [...] "aching love song." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What in <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> fellow driving at, Paret?" [...] he demanded. [...] "It {{sounds to}} me like the ranting of a lunatic dervish. If he thinks so much of us, and the way we run the town, what's he squawking about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} {{something}} about war," [...] he said, [...] "which contradicts most every other experience. There's scarcely a great subject in the world which you don't have to take as a whole, and from the biggest point of view, to appreciate it thoroughly. It's exactly different with war. If you want to understand more than the platitudes, you want to just take in one section of the fighting. Say there are fifty Englishmen, decent fellows, been dragged from their posts as commercial travellers or small tradesmen or labourers or what-not, and they get mixed up with a similar number of Germans. Those Germans ain't the fiends we read about. They're not bubbling over with militarism. They don't want to lord it over all the world. They've exactly the same tastes, the same outlook upon life as the fifty Englishmen whom an iron hand has been forcing to do their best to kill. Those English chaps didn't want to kill anybody, any more than the Germans did. They had to do it, too, simply because {{it was part of the}} game. There was a handful of German prisoners I saw, talking with their guard and exchanging smokes. One was a barber in a country town. The man who had him in tow was an English barber. Bless you, they were talking like one o'clock! That German barber didn't want anything in life except plenty to eat and drink, to be a good husband and good father, and to save enough money to buy a little house of his own. The Englishman was just the same. He'd as soon have had that German for a pal for a day's fishing or a walk in the country, as any one else. They'd neither of them got anything against the other. Where the <b>hell</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> spirit of hatred? You go down the line, mile after mile, and most little groups of men facing one another are just the same. Here and there, there's some bitter feeling, through some fighting that's seemed unfair, but that's nothing. The fact remains that those millions of men don't hate one another, that they've got nothing to hate one another about, and they're being driven to slaughter one another like savage beasts. For what? Mr. Stenson might supply an answer. Your great editors might. Your great Generals could be glib about it. They could spout volumes of words, but there's no substance about them. I say that in this generation there's no call for fighting, and there didn't ought to be any." ...|$|E
6000|$|All {{along the}} way on the white surface of the blazed trees were {{messages}} left by those who had gone before us. Some of them were profane assaults upon the road-gang. Others were pathetic inquiries: [...] "Where in <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> we?"--"How <b>is</b> <b>this</b> for a prairie route?"--"What river <b>is</b> <b>this,</b> anyhow?" [...] To these pencillings others had added facetious replies. There were also warnings and signs to help us keep out of the mud.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the music}} {{magazine}} De:Bug: “Munich Machine feels like {{the result of a}} dynamic collaboration by Munich residents engaged in the club scene and who know how to work with it.
