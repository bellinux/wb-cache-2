Throughout the single, Fantasia reveals her personal [...] "journey to happiness" [...] by singing, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>you,</b> I met me too." [...] She also shares memories of her past heartbreaks using lyrics such as: “Listen to me when I tell you/Without him {{there would be no}} you/So yes, I thank my ex a little still." [...] The song ends with a spoken word monologue, in which Fantasia details the first time she met Taylor. This part of the track includes lines such as: [...] "I still remember the day, it was beautiful. And if I hadn’t went through the things I went through before then I wouldn’t know how special you are." ...|$|E

Leary explained {{that he did not}} know much about Spider-Man in the comics and was [...] "more of a Batman guy. Not the '60s [...] but the really dark Batman. But my wife was a Spider-Man nut, which was why I went to Tobey Maguire ones." [...] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, [...] "said to me, 'The first time <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>you,</b> I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'" [...] Director Webb said of his casting, [...] "e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him. In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but you understand him. I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good." ...|$|E

500|$|Duncan Preston (who {{appeared}} in Wood's 1981 teleplay Happy Since <b>I</b> <b>Met</b> <b>You)</b> {{was cast in}} weekly roles. He had even turned down {{the chance to play}} Shakespeare and an offer of a world tour as Hotspur in Henry IV, Part One at the same time. Preston later said, [...] "I was at a crossroads and I had the choice of going straight or going off at a tangent with Victoria, I chose the latter and she changed my life". Most famously playing the recurring role of Clifford in Acorn Antiques, he also advertised a men's bra, was [...] "Corin Huntley" [...] – a documentary presenter – and was the voice of the monster Crayola in Wood's parody of Doctor Who. Wood said of Duncan, [...] "He hasn't been exploited properly in the show because I tend to write parts for women, which is fair enough, but it does mean that Duncan plays the bank manager or the man in the hotel. I don't like men's men. Duncan's mainly the sort of man who likes women, so you can talk to him about your ovaries and it causes no embarrassment". Preston said he was cast [...] "because I was so tall".|$|E

Rolling Stone called the song [...] "reflective," [...] while Consequence of Sound {{commented that the}} song is [...] "relatable to the ever-been-broken-hearted with lines like 'I’m speeding by the place that <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>you</b> for the 97th time tonight' and 'If I could ask God just one question: Why aren’t you here with me tonight?” ...|$|E

2500|$|Martin {{returned}} to films briefly with {{appearances in the}} star-laden, critically panned but commercially successful The Cannonball Run and its sequel Cannonball Run II. He also had a minor hit single with [...] "Since <b>I</b> <b>Met</b> <b>You</b> Baby" [...] and made his first music video, which appeared on MTV. The video was created by Martin's youngest son, Ricci. On March 21, 1987, Martin's son, actor Dean Paul Martin (formerly Dino of the 1960s [...] "teeny-bopper" [...] rock group Dino, Desi & Billy), died when his F-4 Phantom II jet fighter crashed while flying with the California Air National Guard.

2500|$|In 1974, Fender {{recorded}} [...] "Before the Next Teardrop Falls". The single {{was selected}} for national distribution and became a number one hit on the Billboard Country and Pop charts.

2500|$|Between 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, {{including}} four chart toppers. [...] Hits include [...] "What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)", [...] "To Make Love Sweeter For You", [...] "She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)", [...] "Since <b>I</b> <b>Met</b> <b>You</b> Baby", [...] "Once More With Feeling", [...] "One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)", and [...] "Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough". The production on his early country albums, such as Another Place, Another Time and She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye, was sparse, {{quite different from}} the slick [...] "Nashville sound" [...] that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. [...] The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as George Jones and Merle Haggard. [...] In his book Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story, biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording [...] "were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio".|$|E
