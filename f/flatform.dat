50|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of South Sudan crisis on 15 December 2013, Peter warned the people of South Sudan that the Vice President was provoking {{a crisis in the}} country in a meeting they held with President Kiir on 1 May 2013 which he reiterated on national SSTV. He and a group of other Jikany leaders met with former Vice President Riek Machar on 4 May 2013 in which they warned him not to involve and politicize the community of Nuer and SPLA Nuer elements in an SPLM power struggle. On 6 May 2013, Peter and Riek Machar met in his office in which Riek wanted to find out from him what he talked about on National SSTV on 1 May 2013. In front of his aides, Peter explained to Riek that he was taking the country to brink of war by invoking ethnic Nuer sentiments to support his bid for chairmanship of the party rather than using SPLM political <b>flatform</b> to convince voters to elect him. Peter was the first official to call on South Sudanese leaders to stop the crisis before it happened, but instead, he was criticized by Dr. Riek's supports like Hon. Gatluak Riek Jaak and Hon. John Chuol Char saying that Peter was not being truthful and that Dr. Machar was not provoking any crisis in the country. He was also criticized by Nuer Diaspora elements who are staunch supporters of Dr. Riek Machar. But, Peter was vindicated on 15 December 2013 when war brokeout and members of the Nuer community became victims of the crisis because they are from Riek's ethnic group. Peter remained loyal to SPLM under the leadership of President Salva Kiir Mayardit as a symbol of unity and national integration.|$|E

A new way to solve that problem is using Optical Character Recognation (OCR). In this research we developed English - Indonesian, Indonesian - English translator using OCR and Augmented Reality.

Two variations of NN learning rule are employed using feedforward backpropogation architecture for predicting secondary structure of proteins from their promary sequences of amino acids. About 500 sequences and more than 10000 patterns were trained with variable size of patterns. After initial level of training, an accuracy rate of about 70 %- 75 % is obtained through first learning rule wheras 80 - 85 % of accuracy is obtained using the second variation of the learning rule. Both the methods are implemented within a software tool by the name NNSec developed on Visual. NET <b>flatform.</b> I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} {{a kind of}} electro-controlled steering damper’s structure and working principle which uses the magnetorheological fluid as the working medium. In order to design the controll system of the electro-controlled steering damper, {{the model of the}} steering system and the damper based on magnetorheological fluid are established through the dynamic equations, and a PID controller is used. At last, the paper simulates the controll system using a simulation language Modelica on Works, which is a simulation <b>flatform</b> for comp lex physical system modeling and simulation. The results show that the damper can effectively increase the stabilizing speed of the steering system, decrease the over run of the vehicle’s yaw speed, and improve the vehicle’s steering stabilization, especially when the vehicle running in high speed...|$|E
40|$|The seismic {{analysis}} of spatial {{structure in the}} last 40 years was developed from the static to the dynamic analysis, from the elastic analysis to the elasto-plastic analysis, from the deterministic to the stochastic analysis, and from the uniform seismic excitation in one dimension to the non-uniform seismic excitation in multi-dimensions. The practices show that {{the model of the}} spatial structure should be built not only including the roof structure, but the supporting structure and even the foundation as well. Seismic analyses for the nuclear plant, the offshore <b>flatform</b> and the high-rise building have shown that the seismic response of those structures considering the soil-structure interaction (SSI) effect varied a lot compared with that of rigid-connected model. However, few studies have been done for seismic {{analysis of}} spatial structures accounting for soil-structure interaction. In present paper, the 3 D BNWF(Beam On Nonlinear Winkler Foundation) SSI model for the shallow foundation and the 3 D dynamic p-y model for the deep foundation, the earhtquake input model, the elasto-plastic hysteritic model suitable for the superstructure and the substructure are put forward for the seismic analysis of spatial structure. The research will lay a good foundation for the 3 D nonlinear analysis of spatial structure incoporating the SSI under strong earthquake shaking and further promote the performance based design of the spatial structure...|$|E
