40|$|Comparative genomic {{sequencing}} is shedding {{new light}} on bacterial <b>identification,</b> <b>taxonomy</b> and phylogeny. An in silico assessment of a core gene set necessary for cellular functioning was made to determine a consensus set of genes that would be useful for the <b>identification,</b> <b>taxonomy</b> and phylogeny of the species belonging to the subclass Actinobacteridae which contained two orders Actinomycetales and Bifidobacteriales. The subclass Actinobacteridae comprised about 85 % of the actinobacteria families. The following recommended criteria were used to establish a comprehensive gene set; the gene should (i) be long enough to contain phylogenetically useful information, (ii) {{not be subject to}} horizontal gene transfer, (iii) be a single copy (iv) have at least two regions sufficiently conserved that allow the design of amplification and sequencing primers and (v) predict whole-genome relationships. We applied these constraints to 50 different Actinobacteridae genomes and made 1, 224 pairwise comparisons of the genome conserved regions and gene fragments obtained by using Sequence VARiability Analysis Program (SVARAP), which allow designing the primers. Following a comparative statistical modeling phase, 3 gene fragments were selected, ychF, rpoB, and secY with R 2 > 0. 85. Selected sets of broad range primers were tested from the 3 gene fragments and were demonstrated to be useful for amplification and sequencing of 25 species belonging to 9 genera of Actinobacteridae. The intraspecies similarities were 96. 3 - 100 % for ychF, 97. 8 - 100 % for rpoB and 96. 9 - 100 % for secY among 73 strains belonging to 15 species of the subclass Actinobacteridae compare to 99. 4 - 100 % for 16 S rRNA. The phylogenetic topology obtained from the combined datasets ychF+rpoB+secY was globally similar to that inferred from the 16 S rRNA but with higher confidence.

For many years progress consisted in {{the description of}} new species of adult flukes. More recently, attention has been directed to a study of the larval stages and at present one hundred and sixty-six cercari@e have been described in the United States. Only twenty of these larwe, how ever, have been definitely correlated with their adult forms. It is ob vious therefore that further advance is dependent upon knowledge of the life history of these species. Lack of such information keeps the litera ture burdened with almost twice as many specific names as are necessary, since each larval trematode whose adult stage is not recognized, is de scribed as a distinct species.

40|$|Coccidiodomycosis is a {{systemic}} infection, predominantly pulmonary, {{caused by the}} geophilic and dimorphic fungi, Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii. In Brazil, coccidioidomycosis is associated with semi-arid areas in the Northeastern region of this country, which {{is considered one of}} the endemic areas of this disease in South America. These pathogens are morphologically indistinguishable species, but they exhibit molecular differences. Different molecular techniques have been described for the characterization of these species. The nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) from Coccidioides spp. has been described as an important molecular marker for the <b>identification,</b> <b>taxonomy</b> and phylogeny. Currently, there are still shortages of maps for epidemiological approaches in order to direct the correlation between populations of Coccidioides spp. and the outbreaks of coccidiomycosis. Given the above, this study aimed at performing the molecular identification of 18 clinical and environmental isolates of C. posadasii, from Northeastern Brazil, maintained in the fungal collection of the Specialized Medical Mycology Center (CEMM), through PCR, as well as, to analyze the genetic diversity of these isolates by sequencing of 18 S- 28 S regions of nuclear rDNA. The identification of the isolates was performed through PCR, using specific primers Coi 9 - 1 F and Coi 9 -R. The sequencing of the 18 S- 28 S rDNA regions was performed through the method of chain termination by dideoxynucleotides, using the kit DYEnamicTM ET terminators cycle sequencing (GE Healthcare). The results confirmed the identification of all strains included in this study as belonging to the species C. posadasii. The phylogenetic tree based on 18 S- 28 S rDNA region of C. posadasii from CEMM and Coccidioides spp. from Genbank. reveals the formation of a unique cluster encompassing the following strains CEMM 05 - 2 - 063, CEMM 05 - 2 - 064, CEMM 05 - 2 - 066 and CEMM 05 - 2 - 065, in a properly sustained branch, which apparently seems to group these isolates according to their geographical origin. The strains of C. posadasii showed lower genetic divergence in the ITS 1 and ITS 2 regions, when compared to strains of C. immitis. Analyses did not detect differences between strains of clinical origin and those of environmental origin. Further studies involving the analysis of fast evolving markers, such as microsatellites, can provide evidences to determine whether the groups found in this study are derived from a lineage of clonal reproduction. A coccidioidomicose √É uma infec√É√Éo sist√Émica, predominantemente pulmonar, causada pelos fungos dim√Érficos e geof√Élicos, Coccidioides immitis e Coccidioides posadasii. No Brasil, a coccidioidomicose est√É associada a locais situados na zona semi-√Érida da regi√Éo Nordeste, considerada uma das √Éreas end√Émicas da doen√Éa na Am√Érica do Sul. Estes pat√Égenos consistem em esp√Écies morfologicamente indistingu√Éveis, mas que exibem diferen√Éas moleculares peculiares.

Atualmente, ainda h√É escassez de mapas de abordagens epidemiol√Égicas para direcionar a correla√É√Éo entre as popula√É√Ées de Coccidioides spp. com os surtos de coccidioidomicose.

The extreme morphological flexibility of Nostoc species, which is influenced by the life cycle stage and environmental conditions, makes <b>identification</b> and <b>taxonomy</b> based on morphology alone problematic. This is also a reason for the unresolved taxonomic positions and relationships between the genera Anabaena‚ÄìAphanizomenon as well as between Anabaena‚ÄìNostoc. Therefore, supplementary genetic information should be incorporated to give a polyphasic classification system for the order Nostocales. In light of this, we here present the first molecular and phylogenetic characterization of two species of the genus Nostoc- Nostoc linckia and Nostoc punctiforme based on the cpcB-IGS-cpcA locus of the phycocyanin operon.
