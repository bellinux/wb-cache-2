5000|$|A fibrin ring granuloma, {{also known}} as {{doughnut}} granuloma, is a <b>histopathological</b> <b>finding</b> that is characteristic of Q fever. [...] On hematoxylin-eosin staining, the fibrin ring granuloma consists of a central lipid vacuole (usually washed-out during fixing and staining, leaving only an empty hole) surrounded by a dense red fibrin ring and epithelioid macrophages. Fibrin ring granulomas may also be seen in Hodgkin's disease and infectious mononucleosis.|$|E
5000|$|The terms [...] "Tarlov cyst" [...] or [...] "sacral perineural cyst" [...] {{refer to}} cystic lesions of the spinal {{meninges}} with innervation {{as well as}} nerve sheath dilatations with subarchnoid communication. While they were {{once thought to be}} a <b>histopathological</b> <b>finding,</b> they can be radiologically confirmed by specialized time lapsed MRI and CT imaging techniques showing subarchnoid communication from the nerve fibers in the cysts. They can also be surgically verified when the nerve fibers are visualized in the cystic sac. Often the cysts cause erosion from enlargement, damaging vertebrae and discs and can be misdiagnosed as primary stenosis or disc herniation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> {{in cases}} of hairy leukoplakia (HL) are not {{exclusive}} to this lesion. A total of 36 tissue samples from patients previously diagnosed with HL based solely on morphological aspects were used in this study. Our purpose was to confirm the presence of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in these tissue samples by in situ hybridization (ISH), and to compare the detection of EBV with specific <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> observed in each case. Among the 36 specimens, 80. 55 % were EBV positive, confirming the previous clinical and histhophatological diagnosis. None of the <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> analyzed correlated with {{the presence or absence}} of EBV. This shows that a definitive diagnosis of HL cannot be established based on <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> alone. Because there are many important implications on the establishment of definitive diagnosis of HL, the detection of EBV by ISH is obligatory...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{report a}} case of {{atypical}} dome-shaped choroidal osteoma, which was diagnosed by <b>histopathological</b> <b>finding</b> of surgically extracted tumor. Case Report. A 35 -year-old woman presented with visual field abnormality in the left eye (OS). Her best-corrected visual acuity with Landolt ring chart was 1. 0 OS. The funduscopic examination revealed a yellowish dome-shaped choroidal tumor located in the temporal side of the macula with exudative retinal detachment. 25 -gauge pars plana vitrectomy and the extraction of the tumor were performed for the definitive diagnosis. Results. As a result of <b>histopathological</b> <b>finding</b> from the extracted tumor, {{she was diagnosed with}} choroidal osteoma. 10 months after the last surgery, the BCVA is 0. 7 OS.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the histopathological features of corneal graft failures over time. Methods: A single-center retrospective {{analysis was performed}} on corneal specimens diagnosed as corneal graft failure retrieved from the Henry C. Witelson Ophthalmic Pathology Laboratory and Registry (Montreal, Canada) over a 9 -year period. the corneal buttons were divided into 3 different groups according to the time between the diagnosis of corneal graft failure and regraft. Corneal specimens obtained during keratoplasty were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin and periodic acid-Schiff. Five different histopathological findings were evaluated in each specimen. Results: Overall, the most common <b>histopathological</b> <b>finding</b> was endothelial decompensation (97. 2 %). Subepithelial pannus (38. 9 %), vessels in the corneal stroma (11. 1 %), and anterior synechiae (2. 8 %) were the other present findings. the inflammatory reaction was considered discrete in 83. 3 % of the cases. the only significant <b>histopathological</b> <b>finding</b> correlated with time was the presence of vessels in the corneal stroma (P = 0. 0092). Conclusions: Corneal neovascularization, represented {{by the presence of}} vessels in the corneal stroma, was the only <b>histopathological</b> <b>finding</b> correlated with time. Because it is a known factor of poor prognosis, our findings strongly support that early regraft has higher chances of success.

40|$|Introduction Tobacco use is an {{important}} risk factor for advanced <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> on edentulous alveolar ridge mucosa. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the effects of smoking on <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> on edentulous alveolar ridge mucosa. Material and methods The experimental group consisted of 48 patients (29 smokers and 19 nonsmokers). The mean age of smokers was 42. 6 and of nonsmokers 48. 7 years. The anamnesis included the following data: age, sex, diseases and toxic habits-cigarette smoking. Biopsy samples were taken from the edentulous alveolar ridge mucosa without gross signs of symptoms. Results The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day was 11. 5 ± 7. The results of χ² test proved that there were no statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05) in <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> on the alveolar ridge mucosa. The mean duration of smoking was 12. 7 ± 5 years. Hyperkeratosis was established in 76. 92 % of smokers who smoked longer than 15 years. The mean-age at which smokers began smoking was 27. 3 ± 8 years and there were no statistically significant differences in <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> on the alveolar ridge mucosa correlated with the beginning of smoking. Conclusion On the basis of our research we conclude that smokers who have been smoking for 15 years are at risk for developing histopathological changes of the alveolar ridge mucosa, but there were no statistically significant differences in <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> on the alveolar ridge mucosa correlated with the number of cigarettes per day and the beginning of smoking. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} value of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in differentiation of benign and malignant omental lesions. Patients and methods: MDCT scan was performed for 37 patients with omental lesions after administration of oral and intravenous contrast. The CT diagnosis was {{compared with the}} final <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings.</b> Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of MDCT were calculated using surgical and <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> as the gold standard. Results: MDCT findings of all cases with omental torsion, cystic lymphangioma, and loculated fluid in the greater omentum correlated with the surgical and <b>histopathological</b> <b>findings</b> with 100 % diagnostic accuracy. However, the diagnosis was missed in two patients from seven (2 / 7) with tuberculous peritonitis and in two patients from 21 (2 / 21) with peritoneal carcinomatosis with sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of 73 %, 92 %, 85 % and 90 %, 95 %, 93 %, respectively.
