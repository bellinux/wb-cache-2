40|$|Severe {{damage is}} {{produced}} in tissues <b>by</b> <b>freezing</b> and thawing. Until now, a {{great majority of the}} studies are performed qualitatively, lacking any quantitative approach. An important step is to choose the best option among different freezing methods. To approach the complex problem of damage produced in tissues <b>by</b> <b>freezing,</b> in this paper we present the classical mechanics approach and a quantitative study making use of a fractal methodology (evaluation of fractal dimension by box-counting method). A comparative fractal analysis between two different steps of freezing the human thoracic diaphragm muscle has been performed to quantify the voids and cracks produced <b>by</b> <b>freezing</b> (samples were placed in a cryostat chamber). Moreover, a standard Euclidean morphometry was performed to determine area and shape of the muscle nuclei after the two steps of freezing. Fractal dimension of the ice-tissue interface structures increased with decreasing temperature (p< 0. 0001), percentage of cell muscle decreased (p< 0. 01), while standard morphometry of the nuclei didn’t show any modifications. Our results show the ability of the fractal approach to accurately quantify the damage produced <b>by</b> <b>freezing</b> and reveals that the lowest temperature produces the most damag...|$|R

40|$|It was {{the aim of}} {{the project}} to improve the {{mechanical}} dewatering of sewage sludge <b>by</b> <b>freezing.</b> The dewatering of sewage sludge to high contents of dry solids is prohibited by the water trapped within the cells of the sludge. <b>By</b> <b>freezing</b> the cell water can be released partly due to osmotic effects and damages of the cell walls. Three types of sludge were investigated: aerobically and anaerobically stabilized sludge and not stabilized sludge. After the conditioning <b>by</b> <b>freezing</b> the content of dry solids could be raised with the same dewatering device from 25 % to 40 % by weight for not stabilized sludge, from 33 % to 45 % for the aerobically stabilized sludge and from 42 % to 60 % for the anaerobically stabilized sludge. That means for all sludges that the quantity of water to be evaporated in a following drying process is reduced by about 50 %. Therefore important energy savings are possible but the realization of the sludge conditioning <b>by</b> <b>freezing</b> as a continuous process is impeded mainly by the very low freezing velocity of about 1 mm/h, necessary for the reported improvements.
