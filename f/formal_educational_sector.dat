However, there are instances of disputes among inhabitants, some of which continue for decades. Nuristan has suffered from its inaccessibility and lack of infrastructure. The government presence is under-developed, even compared to neighboring provinces. Nuristan's <b>formal</b> <b>educational</b> <b>sector</b> is weak, with few professional teachers. Due to its proximity to Pakistan, many of the inhabitants are actively involved in trade and commerce across the border.|$|E
40|$|Sustainability is a {{dominant}} theme in tourism practice. Increasingly, {{research and education}} of tourism stakeholders is also necessary in improving sustainable tourism practice. This book pays systematic attention to education for sustainability in tourism, and is thus a valuable resource for sustainable tourism educators and scholars. The book is divided into four parts. Part I provides a reference for educators seeking to understand core knowledge areas, ethics, corporate social responsibility and governance. Part II examines issues and processes relevant to understanding tourism and sustainability in the <b>formal</b> <b>educational</b> <b>sector,</b> including universities, vocational training and school settings. Part III explores learning and sustainable tourism in non-institutional settings, including destination communities, coaching and mentoring and visitor learning. The final part provides a collection of cases to illustrate the use of different pedagogies and assessment approaches in education for sustainability in tourism. The book will be accompanied by instructor resources to assist educators teaching in the field...|$|E
40|$|Although great {{importance}} {{is attached to}} the role of education in national development in Southeast Asia, its role has been ambivalent. In the colonial period, education was a central way in which societies mobilised to challenge and resist European rulers. Yet education has also been the central vehicle through which colonial and post-colonial states have sought to impose their own visions and discipline their subjects. Southeast Asia’s history has been marked by a cultural willingness to borrow and adapt ideas, practices and institutions from outside. Yet this has also been a source of anxiety and conflict. The ‘indigenous’ is often a product of an immediate post-colonial history, rather than the expression of a longer cultural experience. Historians can try to provide a useful narrative of regional thinking about education and development in Southeast Asia, particularly during its key ‘periods of transition’, and thus help to set educational developments within in a wider context. Providing a historical perspective, this paper attempts to map some of the region’s capacities and capabilities, and to examine how adequately they have been exploited by the <b>formal</b> <b>educational</b> <b>sector.</b> ...|$|E

(Multiculturalism and Education) This {{research}} {{will look at}} specific problem areas specifically pertaining to life skills which hamper the disadvantaged pupil in his development in the <b>formal</b> and non-formal <b>educational</b> <b>sector</b> of the school. with these identified factors, I aim to develop an acceptable information base for staff who have no in-service training {{as to how to}} assist, handle and participate with the sudden influx of disadvantaged pupils. This study is therefore aimed at gaining information to assist the teacher as well as the pupil. Reasons for the non-performance and thus the high failure rate, will also be noted in this study. One of the aims is to use pupil feedback extensively for the required information. My final aim is to illicit future research in this direction, thus assisting all parties...|$|R
40|$|Pupils’ misbehaviour {{has been}} {{attracting}} {{the attention of}} media, educators and policy makers in many countries {{over the past several}} decades. The literature on the subject is extensive and ranges across different disciplines, foci and methodologies. However, the call for new understanding is still strong, as the interest in the topic seems not to abate. The present study adds to the literature by exploring how secondary school teachers manage incidents of minor misbehaviour in class. A case study methodology has been used, including classroom observations and interviews of six subject teachers, teaching the same year 8 bottom-set class, within one comprehensive secondary school. A third source of data is constituted by relevant school documents. Analysis of the six cases suggests a theory (the Congruence Hypothesis), which might explain why some teachers are more effective than others in tackling minor misbehaviour in school. Relying on evidence from the data, the hypothesis suggests that, among the many factors influencing pupils' behaviour, a significant element is the degree of congruence between the teachers' belief system, their classroom conduct and the school culture. The theory builds upon a social ecological perspective – which considers the individual, organization, community, and culture as spheres nested into one another like Russian dolls (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) - and takes into consideration two of those spheres: the individual (called the personal congruence level) and the organization (the institutional congruence level). It is hypothesized that the more the teachers are congruent at both personal and institutional level, the less likely it is that pupils will engage in minor misbehaviour. The concept of congruence finds sparse application within the educational field and makes almost no appearance in the area of pupils' misbehaviour. Consequently, the thesis can be considered as pioneer work. However, the aim of the study is not to present a definitive statement, but to put forward a model that could serve as a framework for further reflection and understanding. The findings are a useful addition to the knowledge-base relating to effective teaching on matter of classroom behaviour management. Potentially they have implications for a range of stakeholders in both the informal and <b>formal</b> <b>educational</b> <b>sectors,</b> ranging from teachers and school leaders to governors, teachers' trainers and policy maker...|$|R

40|$|Non-formal {{education}} (NFE) has {{the potential}} to provide diverse learning opportunities for personal and professional development. Proponents of NFE conclude that it creatively and flexibly responds to ever-changing socio-economic challenges. In practice, these contributions are highly dependent upon the viability of NFE and the context in which it is delivered. This research studied US and Scottish national community education programs, designed for vulnerable and disadvantaged youth, in order to examine NFE. As a comparative case study, the research developed a model of NFE from the literature reviewed. This model was applied to explain and analyze governance, the use of social and human capital theories as well as other important concepts related to each program. Interviews (with policy leaders, community level program administrators and young people) as well as national and local documents informed the analysis. The top-down construct of community education programs demonstrated that policy influenced implementation within communities. Community level administrators could also plan programs, however, within the limits of policy. Both case studies were primarily similar in their norms and goals but also had interesting differences at national and local levels. The findings showed how history, western ideologies and youth narratives have a pervasive impact on programs. The case studies revealed contributions of NFE to lifelong learning, seen through the lens of social and human capital. Furthermore, a critical discussion was interwoven throughout the thesis and revealed challenges and tensions {{at all levels of the}} model. NFE is a complex and variable concept, and it continues to struggle for legitimacy and recognition within the wider education narrative. However, NFE’s relationship with government policy, its use within communities and the experienced outcomes for youth are testament that it is integral and influential within the narrative. Further NFE research and practices should be encouraged in order to understand its role and impact. There is an emphasis made here to expand the research on NFE because socio-economic inequality, concerns about youth transition and the importance of learning beyond the <b>formal</b> <b>educational</b> <b>sector</b> are universal and consistent issues...|$|E
