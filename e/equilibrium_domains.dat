40|$|Different {{macroscopic}} domain structures {{have been}} observed during stress-induced austenite to martensite phase transition in thin plates of NiTi polycrystalline shape memory alloy (SMA) under quasi-static tension. This paper studies the role of geometric compatibility in forming two-dimensional (2 D) <b>equilibrium</b> <b>domain</b> structures in plates of different aspect ratios W/L (width/length). A nonconvex and nonlocal continuum model of the material is developed and implemented into a finite-element code to simulate the formation of macroscopic domain structures during isothermal quasi-static displacement-control led stretching of the plates. It is shown that geometric compatibility between the deformation of the domains and the boundary constraints {{plays a key role}} in the formation of domain structures. As the degree of boundary constraint is increased by an increase in the width/length ratio W/L of the plate, the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>domain</b> structure changes from the single domain to multiple domains and eventually to martensite-twin domains.

40|$|A model {{simulating}} oscillations in glycolysis was {{formulated in}} terms of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. In the kinetic rate equations every metabolite concentration was replaced with an exponential function of its chemical potential. This led to nonlinear relations between rates and chemical potentials. Each chemical potential was then expanded around its steady-state value as a Taylor series. The linear (first order) term of the Taylor series sufficed to simulate the dynamic behavior of the system, including the damped and even sustained oscillations at low substrate input or high free-energy load. The glycolytic system is autocatalytic in the first half. Because oscillations were obtained only {{in the presence of}} that autocatalytic feed-back loop we conclude that this type of kinetic nonlinearity was sufficient to account for the oscillatory behavior. The matrix of phenomenological coefficients of the system is nonsymmetric. Our results indicate that this is the symmetry property and not the linearity of the flow-force relations in the near <b>equilibrium</b> <b>domain</b> that precludes oscillations. Given autocatalytic properties, a system exhibiting liner flow-force relations and being outside the near <b>equilibrium</b> <b>domain</b> may show bifurcations, leading to self-organized behavior...|$|R

A signaling game model is established to conclude the issuer’s equilibrium signal and the investor’s purchase action. The issuer disguised a letter of intent to uplift its quality if the disguising cost per share stands below the bidding spread. If the investor judges the letter of intent as high-quality, the basis of purchase is that the opportunity cost per share is less than the expectation on the intrinsic value of the IPO stock. Otherwise the investor rejects purchasing on the condition that the opportunity cost outnumbers the valuation of intrinsic value. In conclusion, there exist unique separating equilibrium and pooling equilibrium as a perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and the existence and uniqueness of their <b>equilibrium</b> <b>domains</b> have been verified by numerical simulation.

40|$|The {{characteristic}} cross-tail {{width of}} bursty bulk flows (BBFs) in earth's plasma sheet was investigated at {{two stages of}} its life, one at its onset, the other when it is fully developed. <b>Equilibrium</b> <b>domains</b> with gradient of magnetic field are constructed. Interchange instability analysis of such domains yields the most unstable mode with the half wave length comparable with the observed cross-tail width of a flow burst and the inverse of growth rate comparable with its duration. The thickness of the plasma sheet for the most unstable mode is also comparable to the width of BBFs in the north–south direction. We found that viscosity, the dimension of the unstable domain, {{the thickness of the}} plasma sheet and gradient of the magnetic field together determine the most unstable mode. The ion Larmor radius {{plays an important role in}} viscosity as half effective mean free path. For a fully developed flow, however, velocity-caused pressure difference between the leading and trailing sides of a flow burst also plays a role. The equatorial cross section of flow is reshaped and its cross-tail width is changed as well. Representing the surrounding medium with empirical magnetic field and plasma models, the force balance of the fast flow is analyzed.

40|$|The {{effective}} field {{model for the}} dynamics of the triple helix d(T) n - d(A) n - d(T) n DNA polymer in solution has been applied to determine the vibrational normal modes of the system for both A and B conformation. ^ The effect of site-bound counterions as compared to the area-bound counterions has been considered specifically by explicitly introducing degrees of freedom for the three counterions associated with a unit cell and coupling these to the DNA degrees of freedom via appropriate interactions. Stability of the system for all vibrational modes (positive eigenvalues for the solution of the dynamics problem) was used as a criterion to find possible equilibrium positions of the site-bound counterions in specific conditions of weak covalent bonding between the counterions and the phosphate free oxygens and distance dependent dielectric constants. ^ Normal mode calculation for the A conformation shows that this type of triple helix is not stable in aqueous solutions unless the counterions are site-bound in certain positions close to the phosphate groups. The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>domains</b> for the positions of the counterions in both conformations have been determined. Free energy calculations for the two triple helices show that the B conformation is more stable than the A conformation. ^ Our calculated normal modes match reasonably well with the experimental IR spectra. ^ The effect of adding structural waters to the triplex DNA in the B conformation have been studied.

40|$|In the Sesia Zone, Western Alps, a {{large volume}} of {{orthogneiss}} formed {{as a result of}} eclogite fades metamorphism and deformation of quartz diorite during early Alpine underthrusting and subduction. Rare lenses of undeformed metaquartz diorite, preserved within the orthogneiss, represent an early stage in the evolution of this latter rock type. The metamorphic and microstructural evolution of the orthogneiss in the eclogite fades has been reconstructed from studies of gradational contacts between undeformed and strongly deformed rocks. High pressure transformations of the original igneous plagioclase + biotite + quartz assemblage to jadeitic pyroxene (Jd 0. 95 - 0. 85 + zoisite + quartz + garnet + 2 muscovites developed prior to deformation. Slow intergranular diffusion resulted in a state of disequilibrium between small textural domains in the metaquartz diorite. The compositions of the phases of the undeformed metaquartz diorite do not reflect the bulk rock composition, but were controlled by their position relative to reactant phases. The jadeitic pyroxenes, for example, formed in localized domains which originally consisted of sodic plagioclase whereas omphacite was the equilibrium pyroxene for the bulk rock composition. Mineralogical changes which occurred during subsequent deformation of the metaquartz diorite are interpreted as resulting from a progressive enlargement of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>domains</b> and the partial equilibration of mineral compositions to the bulk rock composition rather than from changes in pressure and temperature. Initially during high-strain deformation, fine-grained aggregates of jadeitic pyroxene + quartz + zoisite (originally pseudomorphing plagioclase) are inferred to have deformed by a mechanism of grain boundary sliding accommodated by diffusive mass transfer. Muscovite and garnet compositions homogenized during the deformation but due to slow intracrystalline diffusion, pyroxene compositions (Jd 0. 95 - 0. 80) remained metastable. The coarsening of pyroxene eventually terminated deformation by grain boundary sliding and this mineral subsequently deformed by intracrystalline plastidty. This latter process was accompanied by and perhaps catalysed a change in pyroxene composition from metastable jadeite towards omphacite by a reaction involving the resorption of garnet and the nucleation and growth of paragonite. The resulting orthogneiss consists of quartz + omphadte + garnet + phengite + paragonite + zoisite. The rock is characterized by a broad range of pyroxene compositions (Jd 0. 8 - 0. 5) due to the incomplete equilibration of this mineral to the bulk rock composition and a lack of Fe-Mg exchange equilibrium between pyroxene and garnet. However, in contrast to the undeformed metaquartz diorite, there are no obvious textural indications of disequilibrium between phases in the orthogneis...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the American Institute of Physics via the DOI in this record. Four {{different}} designs of partially built hard disk write heads with a yoke comprising four repeats of NiFe (1 nm) /CoFe (50 nm) were studied by both x-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM) and time-resolved scanning Kerr microscopy (TRSKM). These techniques were used to investigate the static <b>equilibrium</b> <b>domain</b> configuration and the magnetodynamic response across the entire structure, respectively. Simulations and previous TRSKM studies have made proposals for the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>domain</b> configuration of similar structures, but no direct observation of the equilibrium state of the writers has yet been made. In this study, static XPEEM images of the equilibrium state of writer structures were acquired using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism as the contrast mechanism. These images suggest that the crystalline anisotropy dominates the <b>equilibrium</b> state <b>domain</b> configuration, but competition with shape anisotropy ultimately determines the stability of the equilibrium state. Dynamic TRSKM images were acquired from nominally identical devices. These images suggest that a longer confluence region may hinder flux conduction from the yoke into the pole tip: the shorter confluence region exhibits clear flux beaming along the symmetry axis, whereas the longer confluence region causes flux to conduct along one edge of the writer. The observed variations in dynamic response agree well with the differences in the equilibrium magnetization configuration visible in the XPEEM images, confirming that minor variations in the geometric design of the writer structure can have significant effects on the process of flux beaming.
