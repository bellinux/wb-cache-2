5|$|Microsoft {{introduced}} Windows Server 2012 and its developer preview in the BUILD 2011 {{conference on}} September 9, 2011. However, unlike Windows 8, the developer preview of Windows Server 2012 was only {{made available to}} MSDN subscribers. It included a graphical user interface (GUI) based on Metro design language and a new Server Manager, a graphical application used for server management. On February 16, 2012, Microsoft released an update for developer preview build that extended its <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> from April 8, 2012 to January 15, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{returned}} to Sydney in November 1921, and was paid off into reserve in December. By this time battlecruisers built before the Battle of Jutland were considered obsolete, {{and there is}} no record of the Admiralty suggesting that Australia purchase a replacement. Moreover, {{it is unlikely that the}} Australian Government would have agreed to such a suggestion given the prevailing political and financial conditions. As the Admiralty had decided to phase out 12-inch guns and had stopped the manufacture of shells for these weapons shortly after the war, it would have been necessary to replace Australias main armament once the Navy's stock of shells reached their <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> given that it was not possible to produce replacement shells in Australia. This was also not financially feasible for the government, particularly given the RAN's lack of interest in retaining the ship.|$|E
5|$|Further {{denominations}} {{ranging from}} $5000 to $500 million were issued {{in the period}} between August 2006 and May 2008 as cent cheques quickly became outmoded. In {{the second quarter of}} 2008, special Agro cheques (Agricultural Cheques) were issued in denominations ranging from $5 billion to $100 billion as the currency exchange rate was floated. Since the functions were similar to Bearer cheques, it was in regular use as prices continue to rise. These cheques also carried time limits and limited security features. In the final months of the second dollar, the $200000 cheque was the lowest legal tender denomination by decree, despite having its <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> extended twice. The $100000000 Bearer Cheque would have been the lowest legal tender denomination in circulation had the expiry dates of currency cheques been enforced without extension, with the $100 billion Agro Cheque being the highest whether or not the $200000 note was legal tender.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the {{influence}} of <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> on consumers' behavior when they purchase food products. After a brief summary of the legal status of <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> and the strategic issues of manufacturers and the distributors, it is noted that consumer attitudes to <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> can be explained by the notion of temporal orientation. There is also a sensitivity to the time left to consume a product. the paper proposes a typology and suggest some strategies to address the problems identified...|$|R

5|$|Stations {{are divided}} into two areas, paid and unpaid, which allow the rail {{operators}} to collect fares by restricting entry only through the fare gates, also known as access control gates. These gates, connected to a computer network, can read and update electronic tickets capable of storing data, and can store information such as the initial and destination stations and the duration for each trip. General Ticketing Machines sell tickets for single trips or allow the customer to buy additional value for stored-value tickets. Tickets for single trips, coloured in green, are valid only {{on the day of}} purchase, and have a time allowance of 30 minutes beyond the estimated travelling time. Tickets that can be used repeatedly until their <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> require a minimum amount of stored credit.|$|E

50|$|Late 2013, it {{was found}} that the Pentavalent vaccine {{manufacturer}} - The Serum Institute in India was distributing 2 sets of Pentavac PFS vaccines for administration. One set with manufacturing and <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> was being provided to private hospitals, while the other set without manufacturing and <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> was being distributed to government hospitals. It was later clarified that the dates not appearing on one set of vaccines did not contravene any regulations as they were supplied by UNICEF and was legal under Rule 94 applicable to exports under Indian Law.|$|R
50|$|With {{outbound}} marketing, marketers {{are often}} {{expected to find}} different ways {{to cope with the}} rejections from potential customers. Also, advertisements have <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> and once the <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> have been reached, the campaign will have to be started again. Thus, the return on investment of advertisement campaigns is rather low most of the time. Outbound marketing is often considered to be a poorly targeted technique as it cannot be personalised to specific customers. Moreover, advertisements often interrupt customers and as such, they may be wrongly considered by potential consumers.|$|R

25|$|The {{time value}} of an option is {{the total value of}} the option, less the {{intrinsic}} value. It partly arises from the uncertainty of future price movements of the underlying. A component of the time value also arises from the unwinding of the discount rate between now and the <b>expiry</b> <b>date.</b> In the case of a European option, the option cannot be exercised before the <b>expiry</b> <b>date,</b> so it is possible for the time value to be negative; for an American option if the time value is ever negative, you exercise it (ignoring special circumstances such as the security going ex dividend): this yields a boundary condition.|$|E
25|$|Emergency travel {{documents}} are one-use documents issued to Canadians for direct {{return to their}} home country, or to the nearest Canadian diplomatic mission where full passport services are offered.

25|$|Heinrich Göbel in 1893 {{claimed he}} had {{designed}} the first incandescent light bulb in 1854, with a thin carbonized bamboo filament of high resistance, platinum lead-in wires in an all-glass envelope, and a high vacuum. Judges of four courts raised doubts about the alleged Göbel anticipation, {{but there was never}} a decision in a final hearing due to the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> of Edison's patent. A research work published 2007 concluded that the story of the Göbel lamps in the 1850s is a legend.|$|E
25|$|Metcards were 'validated' when {{entering}} or exiting railway stations, {{and getting}} on trams or buses. The first validation printed an <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> and {{time on the}} back of the ticket. Subsequent validations of most types of tickets did not print extra times but the data was intended to be used to count passenger numbers (in order to improve transport services). Revalidation of already validated tickets, whilst functionally unnecessary, was and is still required by law and occasional campaigns continue to remind passengers of this.|$|E

25|$|The build was {{released}} for download {{later in the}} day in standard 32-bit and 64-bit versions, plus a special 64-bit version which included SDKs and developer tools (Visual Studio Express and Expression Blend) for developing Metro-style apps. The Windows Store was announced during the presentation, but was not available in this build. According to Microsoft, there were about 535,000 downloads of the developer preview within the first 12 hours of its release. Originally set to expire on March 11, 2012, in February 2012 the Developer Preview's <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> was changed to January 15, 2013.|$|E

Visas are issued in at an embassy or consulate of the Republic of Azerbaijan or upon arrival at the border crossing points of the Republic of Azerbaijan.|$|E
25|$|A second Special Bulletin was {{published}} by the AAIB on 21 December 2015. It revealed that the aircraft was not compliant with its Permit to Fly insofar as the ejection seat cartridges installed in the aircraft had passed their <b>expiry</b> <b>date.</b> The maintenance organisation had ordered new cartridges in January 2014, but the new cartridges did not arrive until June 2015, {{a year and a}} half after ordering them, and two months before the accident. The maintainer of the aircraft stated it was acting under the privileges of its maintenance approvals. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) was reported to be of the view that the maintainer did not have such privilege.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the feasibility {{and accuracy of}} using Internet-based videoconferencing for double-checking medications. Ten participants checked 30 different medications using a desktop PC and a webcam. The accuracy of the video-based checks was compared with 'face-to-vial' checks. The checks included the drug name, dosage and <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> of ampoules, vials and tablets, as well as graduations on syringes. There was 100 % accuracy for drug name, dosage, and graduations on syringes greater than 1 unit. The <b>expiry</b> <b>dates</b> proved more difficult to read, and accuracy was only 63 %. The mean overall accuracy was 91 % for all items. Internet video-based medication double-checks may have a useful {{role to play in}} processes to ensure the safe use of medications in home care...|$|R

50|$|These {{issues of}} {{corruption}} {{have become a}} notable hindrance to the country’s fight against HIV/AIDS.

25|$|With the {{bid offer}} <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> of August 7 approaching, Clearly Canadian decided {{to extend its}} offer {{expiration}} date to August 19. It claimed it was doing this to give shareholders more time {{to decide whether or}} not to sell their shares. This extension caused further rifts between the two companies, with Sun-Rype claiming reason for the extension, while Clearly Canadian stayed focused on acquiring as many shares as possible. With the final bid deadline fast approaching, Clearly Canadian used many tactics in an attempt to gain more shares, including sending out circulars, hosting public receptions, and talking to community press. In the end however, Sun-Rype, which spent $741,000 fighting the takeover, was able to prevail over Clearly Canadian, losing only 15.8% of its shares to the beverage corporation.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} distressed or expired stock, distressed {{inventory}} is inventory whose {{potential to be}} sold at a normal cost has passed or will soon pass. In certain industries it could also mean that the stock is or will soon be impossible to sell. Examples of distressed inventory include products which have reached their <b>expiry</b> <b>date,</b> or have reached a date in advance of expiry at which the planned market will no longer purchase them (e.g. 3 months left to expiry), clothing which is out of fashion, music which is no longer popular and old newspapers or magazines. It also includes computer or consumer-electronic equipment which is obsolete or discontinued and whose manufacturer is unable to support it, along with products which use that type of equipment e.g. VHS format equipment and videos.|$|E
25|$|The {{owner of}} an option may on-sell the option to a third party in a {{secondary}} market, in either an over-the-counter transaction or on an options exchange, depending on the option. The market price of an American-style option normally closely follows that of the underlying stock, being {{the difference between the}} market price of the stock and the strike price of the option. The actual market price of the option may vary depending on a number of factors, such as a significant option holder may need to sell the option as the <b>expiry</b> <b>date</b> is approaching and does not have the financial resources to exercise the option, or a buyer in the market is trying to amass a large option holding. The ownership of an option does not generally entitle the holder to any rights associated with the underlying asset, such as voting rights or any income from the underlying asset, such as a dividend.|$|E
