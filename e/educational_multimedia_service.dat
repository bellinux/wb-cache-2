40|$|The use of <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> {{applications}} {{is growing}} rapidly on the Internet. These applications are generating a huge volume of network traffic, {{which has a}} great impact on network performance and planning. For various purposes, obtaining information on <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> traffic is important. However, traditional analysis methods based on well-known ports cannot be used to analyze such traffic. Because the majority of <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> applications use dynamically allocated port numbers, the traditional methods misidentify <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> traffic as unknown traffic. This paper presents a method for monitoring and analyzing <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> traffic. Our method detects transport protocol and port numbers for dynamically created sessions during a control session. We then use such information to analyze traffic generated by the most popular <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> applications, namely Windows Media, RealMedia, Quicktime, SIP and H. 323. We also present a system architecture that uses our method to monitor and analyze <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> traffic...|$|R
40|$|A recent {{research}} and development project conducted at the University of the South Pacific (USP) examined how <b>educational</b> <b>multimedia</b> can be built according to the learning approaches of the region. Through interviews, questionnaires and usability tests with staff and students at USP, the research team drafted a set of recommendations {{for the development of}} <b>educational</b> <b>multimedia</b> in the region. They then built an interactive CD-rom based on these recommendations. This paper focuses on the results related to cultural context, and the directions they indicate for <b>educational</b> <b>multimedia</b> developers in the South Pacific. Specifically, the study found that Distance and Flexible Learning (DFL) materials do not generally provide the cultural context that staff and students desire at USP, as they rarely utilize local metaphors, examples or Vernacular language. The paper presents approaches developed during the project to provide cultural context in two categories: decentralised and dialogic contextualisation. Through decentralised contextualization tools such as a Wiki or digital scrapbook, students are encouraged to provide their own cultural context to the learning materials. Dialogic contextualisation tools such as virtual peers and interactive quizzes can provide cultural context in a more conversational, personified, and centralised manner. These ideas are illustrated with specific examples of <b>educational</b> <b>multimedia</b> projects, {{so that they can be}} easily replicated and modified by <b>educational</b> <b>multimedia</b> developers in their own contexts...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{deals with}} dynamic voltage and {{frequency}} scaling (DVFS) in mobile <b>multimedia</b> <b>services.</b> The <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> that consume {{a large amount of}} energy cannot be continuously used in mobile devices because of battery limitation. The DVFS has been applied to <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> in previous studies. However, they have only addressed the issue of power saving and overlooked the fact that mobile <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> are sensitive to delays. The proposed method is intended to apply DVFS to <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> considering potential delays. Another problem with previous studies is that either separate devices have been employed or appropriate frequency scaling values have been determined through complicated calculation processes to apply DVFS to <b>multimedia</b> <b>services.</b> On the contrary, the proposed method determines appropriate frequency scaling values using the characteristics of multimedia contents without employing any separate devices or undergoing complicated calculation processes. This has the advantage of allowing DVFS to be applied to real-time multimedia content. The present paper proposes a DVFS application method that divides <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> into video conferences, which are real-time services, and video streaming, which is a non-real-time service, and that reduces energy consumption in a simple manner while considering the constraints of service delays.|$|R

40|$|Future <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> are {{expected}} to be available anytime, anywhere, and by using any computing device. However, clients of a <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> may vary significantly in their processing capability and network connectivity. In addition, even between the same <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> provider and client, there may be dynamic variation in end-to-end resource availability. In such a dynamic and heterogeneous environment, the challenge in <b>multimedia</b> <b>service</b> is to provide each client with satisfactory Quality of Service (QoS), under the constraint of current end-to-end resource availability. Many existing QoS adaptation techniques are very service-specific, and targets only specific types of critical resources.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} three often-overlooked {{characteristics of}} <b>educational</b> <b>multimedia</b> {{systems that are}} important for human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers: (a) learning environments have very different goals and approaches than do workplace environments, so HCI research must investigate issues {{within the context of}} learning; (b) what works for adults will not necessarily work for children, so HCI research must develop usability guidelines that are appropriate for children; (c) girls and boys interact differently with technology, so HCI research must understand how each gender interacts with computers. We illustrate each of these issues with examples from our own research and explain how the characteristics of <b>educational</b> <b>multimedia</b> systems can lead to computing environments that do not hinder children's learning and do not exclude any children on the basis of gender.

40|$|With GPRS and UMTS {{networks}} lunched, wireless <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> are commercially {{becoming the}} most attractive applications next to voice. Because {{of the nature of}} bursty, packet-switched schemes and multiple data rates, the traditional Erlang approach and Poisson models for characterising voice-centric services traffic are not suitable for studying wireless <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> traffic. Therefore, research on the characterisation of wireless <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> traffic is very challenging. The typical reference for the study of wireless <b>multimedia</b> <b>services</b> traffic is wired Internet services traffic. However, because of the differences in network protocol, bandwidth, and QoS requirements between wired and wireless services, their traffic characterisations may not be similar.
