5|$|As {{the first}} new high school built <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>years,</b> many unorthodox ideas were suggested. After many of the ideas were criticized the school {{district}} requested parental input on {{the direction of the}} school's curriculum and held meetings around the city to show their plans for the curriculum. School officials wished to create a balance of college prep classes and vocational programs. The school was planned as and is now a citywide magnet school with no attendance boundary. An emphasis on technology was integrated into the plans for the school.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the play's run in Los Angeles, Woods renewed {{his offer}} to produce the play on Broadway. Although he was a renowned {{producer}} of many famous plays in a career of more than three decades, Woods had lost much of his fortune in the early 1930s and had not produced a hit <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>years.</b> Being refused by a neophyte author shocked him and increased his interest. Woods still wanted the right to make script changes, but he made adjustments to the contract to give Rand more influence. She reluctantly agreed to his terms.|$|E
5|$|In the 1999–2000 season, Hašek was {{hampered}} by a nagging groin injury.

The Sabres played Philadelphia {{in the first round of}} the playoffs again, where Hašek outplayed his 1998 Olympic back-up Roman Čechmánek.

5|$|The Dodgers won the 1963 World Series. This series {{represented}} {{the first time}} that the New York Yankees had lost a World Series in four games. Alston's pitchers excelled, as Koufax struck out 23 batters over two games and Drysdale threw a shutout in Game 3. Over the four games, Alston employed only three starting pitchers and one relief pitcher in the series. In 1964, the team finished 80-82 in its first losing season <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>years.</b> Alston used the team's 1964 performance to motivate them moving forward. In spring training before the 1965 season, he said that he would not let his team forget the difficulties they had in the previous season.|$|E
5|$|The script {{demanded a}} dry location: an {{agricultural}} village {{where it had}} not rained <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>years.</b> To depict the 1890s era, the crew also required a village which lacked electricity, communication and automobiles. Kutch faced the same problems {{at that time and}} hence the village of Kunariya, located a few miles away from Bhuj, was chosen. During the filming of Lagaan, it did not rain at all in the region. However, a week after the shoot finished, it rained heavily bringing relief to Bhuj, which had a lean monsoon the previous year. The typical old Kutch hamlet was built by the local people four months before the arrival of the crew. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake devastated this region and displaced many locals. The crew, including the English, contributed to their cause by donating , with further contributions during the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} {{attack on}} Hammersmith Bridge encouraged the RIRA leadership to launch further attacks in Northern Ireland. On 19 June 2000 a bomb {{was found in}} the grounds of Hillsborough Castle, home of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Mandelson. On 30 June a bomb exploded on the Dublin-to-Belfast railway line near the village of Meigh in County Armagh. The explosion damaged the tracks, and caused disruption to train services. On 9 July a car bomb damaged buildings in Stewartstown, County Tyrone including an RUC station, and on 10 August an attack in Derry was thwarted by the RUC after a van containing a 500lb bomb failed to stop at a police checkpoint. Following a car chase the bombers escaped across the Irish border, and the Irish Army carried out a controlled explosion on the bomb after the van was found abandoned in County Donegal. On 13 September two 80lb bombs were planted at the Magilligan army camp in County Londonderry, one of which was planted in a wooden hut and partially exploded when a soldier {{opened the door to the}} hut. The second bomb was found during a follow-up search and made safe by bomb disposal experts. On 11 November the RUC and British Army prevented a mortar attack after stopping a van near Derrylin, County Fermanagh, and the RUC prevented a further attack on 13 January 2001 when an 1100lb bomb was found in Armagh — the largest bomb found <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>years</b> according to the RUC.|$|E

5|$|The {{ultimatum}} {{contributed to}} the general atmosphere of tension and fear in Europe. It relieved {{some of the pressure}} on Germany that had arisen {{in the aftermath of the}} Anschluss and tested the Soviets' willingness to defend their interests in Eastern Europe. Fears were expressed, both in Lithuania and abroad, that the establishment of diplomatic relations was not the only goal of Warsaw and that more far-reaching ultimata might follow. Speculations arose that Poland might seek to resurrect the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, using Germany's annexation of Austria as a precedent. Poland announced that it planned to create a neutral bloc comprising Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Romania to counter both fascism and communism. It stated that it had no wish to incorporate Lithuanian territories and maintained that the bloc would be formed on the basis of bilateral non-aggression and economic treaties. According to The New York Times, the impact of the ultimatum was felt on Wall Street; on March 17, the foreign currency and bond markets sagged, in some cases reaching the lowest points seen <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>years.</b> These markets recovered on March 19, after the ultimatum was accepted.|$|E
