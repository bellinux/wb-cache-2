Changes are expected to the spawning behaviour of Engraulis encrasicolus adults, to the migration patterns of larvae in the estuary, and to the catches of fisheries in {{the lower part of the}} river and adjacent coastal areas. Spawning of E. encrasicolus occurs in the lower part of the estuary and in the adjacent coastal areas. However, high abundances of larvae have been registered in the middle and upper parts of the estuary, the most productive region of the estuary, that with the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM). In a year of normal inflow, such as the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year</b> 1987 - 1988, some retention of larvae occured in this area. However, in an abnormal <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year</b> with a low inflow (1999 - 2000), and with an increase in freshwater inflow during the spring months, a disturbance to the migration pattern seems to have affected the survival of larvae in the estuary. High river flow, probably associated with an increased input of nutrients, appears to have important und positive effect on adult numbers, because anchovy fishery catches in the adjacent coastal area increased under these conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactive}} effects of elevated atmospheric CO 2 and temperature on seasonal patterns of photosynthesis in Douglas fir (Psuedotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings were examined. Seedlings were grown in sunlit chambers controlled to track either ambient (~ 400 p. p. m.) CO 2 or ambient + 200 p. p. m. CO 2, and either ambient temperature or ambient + 4 °C. Light-saturated net photosynthetic rates were measured approximately monthly over a 21 month period. Elevated CO 2 increased net photosynthetic rates {{by an average}} of 21 % across temperature treatments during both the 1996 <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year,</b> the third year of exposure, and the 1997 <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year.</b> Elevated mean annual temperature increased net photosynthetic rates {{by an average of}} 33 % across CO 2 treatments during both years. Seasonal temperature changes also affected net photosynthetic rates. Across treatments, net photosynthetic rates were highest in the spring and autumn, and lowest in July, August and December–January. Seasonal increases in temperature were not correlated with increases in the relative photosynthetic response to elevated CO 2. Seasonal shifts in the photosynthetic temperature optimum reduced temperature effects on the relative response to elevated CO 2. These results suggest that the effects of elevated CO 2 on net photosynthetic rates in Douglas fir are largely independent of temperature...|$|E

Bloom intensity can be expressed in terms of chlorophyll-a concentration. Previous studies suggest the use of Landsat TM 4 /TM 3 reflectance ratio to retrieve surface chlorophyll-a concentration from aquatic systems. In this study we assumed that a remote sensing trophic state index can be applied to investigate how changes in HRT along the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year</b> affect the spatial distribution of the phytoplankton blooms at Ibitinga&# 8217;s reservoir surface. For that, we formulated two objectives: (1) apply a semi-empirical model which uses this reflectance ratio to map chlorophyll-a concentration at Ibitinga reservoir along the 2005 <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year</b> and (2) assess how changes in hydraulic residence time (HRT) affect the spatial distribution of phytoplankton blooms at Ibitinga Reservoir. The study site was chosen because previous studies reported seasonal changes in the reservoir limnology which might be related to the reservoir seasonality and hydrodynamics. Six Landsat/TM images were acquired over Ibitinga reservoir during 2005 and water flow measurements provided by the Brazilian Electric System National Operator - ONS were used to compute the reservoir´s residence time, which varied from 5. 37 to 52. 39 days during 2005. The HRT in the date of image acquisition was then compared to the distribution of chlorophyll-a in the reservoir. The results showed that the HRT increasing implies the increasing of the reservoir surface occupied by phytoplankton blooms...|$|E
40|$|In the Pacific Northwest (PNW), {{concern about}} the impacts of climate and land cover change on water {{resources}} and flood-generating processes emphasizes {{the need for a}} mechanistic understanding of the interactions between forest canopies and hydrologic processes. Detailed measurements during the 1999 and 2000 hydrologic years were used to modify the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model for application in forested systems. Major changes to the model include improved representation of rainfall interception and stomatal conductance dynamics. The model was developed for the 1999 <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year</b> and tested for the 2000 <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year</b> without mod-ification of the site parameters. The model effectively simulated throughfall, soil water content profiles, and shallow soil temperatures for both years. The largest discrepancies between soil moisture and temperature were observed during periods of discontinuous snow cover due to spatial variability that was not explicitly simulated by the model. Soil warming at bare locations was delayed until most of the snow cover ablated because of the large heat sink associated with the residual snow patches. During the summer, simulated transpiration decreased from a maximum monthly mean of 2. 2 mm day 21 in July to 1. 3 mm day 21 in September as a result of decreasing soil moisture and declining net radiation. The results indicate that a relatively simple representation of the vegetation canopy can accurately simulate seasonal hydrologic fluxes in this environment, except during periods of discontinuous snow cover. 1...|$|E

40|$|Even in {{physically}} based distributed hydrological models, various remaining parameters must {{be estimated}} for each sub-catchment. This can involve tremendous effort, {{especially when the}} number of sub-catchments is large and the applied hydrological model is computationally expensive. Automatic parameter estimation tools can significantly facilitate the calibration process. Hence, we combined the nonlinear parameter estimation tool PEST with the distributed hydrological model WaSiM. PEST is based on the Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg method, a gradient-based nonlinear parameter estimation algorithm. WaSiM is a fully distributed hydrological model using physically based algorithms for most of the process descriptions. WaSiM was applied to the alpine/prealpine Ammer River catchment (southern Germany, 710 km 2 ) in a 100 &times; 100 m 2 horizontal resolution. The catchment is heterogeneous in terms of geology, pedology and land use and shows a complex orography (the difference of elevation is around 1600 m). Using the developed PEST-WaSiM interface, the hydrological model was calibrated by comparing simulated and observed runoff at eight gauges for the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year</b> 1997 and validated for the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year</b> 1993. For each sub-catchment four parameters had to be calibrated: the recession constants of direct runoff and interflow, the drainage density, and the hydraulic conductivity of the uppermost aquifer. Additionally, five snowmelt specific parameters were adjusted for the entire catchment. Altogether, 37 parameters had to be calibrated. Additional a priori information (e. g. &nbsp;from flood hydrograph analysis) narrowed the parameter space of the solutions and improved the non-uniqueness of the fitted values. A reasonable quality of fit was achieved. Discrepancies between modelled and observed runoff were also due to the small number of meteorological stations and corresponding interpolation artefacts in the orographically complex terrain. A detailed covariance analysis was performed allowing to derive confidence bounds for all estimated parameters. The correlation between the estimated parameters was in most cases negligible, showing that parameters were estimated independently from each other...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to analyse the influence of a topsoil of pyroclastic origin on microbial contamination of groundwater in a carbonate aquifer and verify the reliability of thermotolerant coliforms and fecal enterococci as bacterial indicators. The research was carried out through hydrogeological and microbiological monitoring at an experimental field site in Italy during two <b>hydrologic</b> <b>years</b> and through column tests in a laboratory. The taxonomic classification of fecal indicators detected in spring water samples was performed using API 20 galleries. Fecal enterococci were also identified by means of 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The topsoil of pyroclastic origin significantly retains both thermotolerant coliforms and fecal enterococci. Results of column tests carried out in soil blocks collected randomly within the test site suggest that Escherichia coli was more retained than Enterococcus faecalis, even though this difference is statistically significant in only two out of six soil samples. Thus, a non-uniform difference in retention is expected at field scale. This suggestion is in agreement with the results of the microbiological monitoring. In fact, fecal enterococci were a more reliable indicator than thermotolerant coliforms for detecting contamination at both seasonal springs of the aquifer system, while no significant differences were observed at the perennial spring...|$|R
40|$|The {{controls}} on the spatial distribution of soil moisture include static and dynamic variables. The superposition of static and dynamic controls can lead to different soil moisture patterns for a given catchment during wetting, draining, and drying periods. These relationships can be further complicated in snow-dominated mountain regions where soil water input by precipitation is largely dictated by the spatial variability of snow accumulation and melt. In this study, we assess {{controls on}} spatial and temporal soil moisture variability in a small (0. 02 km 2 ), snow-dominated, semi-arid catchment by evaluating spatial correlations between soil moisture and site characteristics through different hydrologic seasons. We assess {{the relative importance of}} snow with respect to other catchment properties on the spatial variability of soil moisture and track the temporal persistence of those controls. Spatial distribution of snow, distance from divide, soil texture, and soil depth exerted significant control on the spatial variability of moisture content throughout most of the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year.</b> These relationships were strongest during the wettest period and degraded during the dry period. As the catchment cycled through wet and dry periods, the relative spatial variability of soil moisture tended to remain unchanged. We suggest that the static properties in complex terrain (slope, aspect, soils) impose first order {{controls on the}} spatial variability of snow and consequent soil moisture, and that the interaction of dynamic (timing of water input) and static properties propagate that relative constant spatial variability through the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year.</b> The results demonstrate snow exerts significant influence on how water is retained within mid-elevation semi-arid catchments throughout the year and infer that reductions in annual snowpacks associated with changing climate regimes may strongly influence spatial and temporal soil moisture patterns and catchment physical and biological processes...|$|E

The latter figure shows that current flows and the drainage axes in the rivers are somewhat parallel. These lines are neither divergent (dismissing the idea of a concentrated recharge {{at the level of the}} river), nor convergent (suggesting exfiltration from groundwater).

40|$|Contemporary {{large-scale}} {{changes in}} satellite-derived snow cover were examined over the Northern Hemisphere extratropical land (NEL) areas. These areas encompass 55 % {{of the land}} in the Northern Hemisphere. Snow cover (S) transient regions, the 'centers of action' relative to interannual variations of snow cover, were identified for the years 1972 - 1992. During these years a global retreat in snow cover extent (SE) occurred {{in the second half of}} the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year</b> (April-September). Mean annual SE has decreased by 10 % (2. 3 x 10 (exp 6) sq km). Negative trends account for one-third to one-half of the interannual continental variance of SE. The historical influence of S on the planetary albedo and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is investigated. The mean annual response of the S feedback on the radiative balance (RB) is negative and suggests a largescale heat redistribution. During autumn and early winter (up to January), however, the feedback of S on the planetary RB may be positive. Only by February does the cooling effect of S (due to albedo increase) dominate the planetary warming due to reduced OLR over the S. Despite a wintertime maximum in SE, the feedback in spring has the greatest magnitude. The global retreat of spring SE should lead to a positive feedback on temperature. Based on observed records of S, changes in RB are calculated that parallel an observed increase of spring temperature during the past 20 years. The results provide a partial explanation of the significant increase in spring surface air temperature observed over the land areas of the Northern Hemisphere during the past century. The mean SE in years with an El Nino and La Nina were also evaluated. El Nino events are generally accompanied by increased SE over the NEL during the first half of the hydrological year. In the second half of the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year</b> (spring and summer), the El Nino events are accompanied by a global retreat of SE...|$|E

One step towards more effectively protecting and managing these nine populations is ranking factors that influence recruitment {{in each of these}} river segments. We developed a model to suggest which of seven mechanistic factors contribute most to lost recruitment in each river segment: (1) temperature-related mortality during incubation, (2) flow-related mortality during incubation, (3) downstream export of larvae, (4) limitation of juvenile and adult habitat, (5) mortality of all ages during summer episodes of poor water quality in reservoirs, (6) entrainment mortality of juveniles and adults, and (7) angling mortality. We simulated recruitment with, and without, each of the seven factors, over a typical series of <b>hydrologic</b> <b>years.</b> We found a hierarchical pattern of limitation. In the first tier, river segments with severe water quality problems grouped together. Poor water quality during summer had a strong negative effect on recruitment in the river segments between Swan Falls Dam and Hell’s Canyon Dam.

The Medbasin-monthly rainfall-runoff model (Medbasin-M) was used for runoff simulation. The model was calibrated for twelve <b>hydrologic</b> <b>years</b> (1962 − 1973), and the simulation results were validated with the observed annual runoff for nine water years (1974 − 1982).

River flow inputs were modeled using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model (Témez model). The Témez model parameters were calibrated in two models (B- 156 and B- 420) without using runoff records. River flow inputs in the other models were estimated using runoff parameters from a nearby catchment (the Meca River) for model A and not considered for models C- 156 and C- 420. The goodness of fit of the models was assessed using a weighted R 2 (wR 2). The analyses indicate that the calibration of the Témez model without using runoff records does not provide the best results, although it must be possible to obtain reasonable results with a longer and more homogeneous period of study. The use of Témez model parameters calibrated for the Meca River catchment does not permit an accurate calibration of Absmax. In addition, the analyses indicate that it is possible to develop a model with a high goodness of fit using data from a single meteorological station located in the marshes (station 5858) and considering runoff as null, although further analyses are required to asses how this model would simulate the different phases of the hydrologic cycle of the marshes.

For the purpose of statistical analysis, 18 -year streamflow record of River Osun at Apoje gauging station was obtained from Ogun-Osun River Basin and Rural Development Authourity Abeokuta, Nigeria.

Changes in salinity, nutrients and turbidity, which were mainly due to the changes in freshwater input, had an important influence {{on the structure of}} the planktonic assemblages. Nevertheless, coastal upwelling can also influence the productivity of the lower estuarine area during short periods both in winter and in summer. In 2000, a short-term freshwater pulse during May (average 126. 46 m 3 s 1) was markedly beneficial; phytoplanktonic diversity increased, and this caused an increase in zooplanktonic diversity. As phyto-zooplankton coupling in these systems is an important regulator of processes in the trophic web, changes in the dominant groups can have consequences on water quality, especially on the occurrence of toxic plankton blooms. Modelling simulations indicate that a day discharge of 50 m 3 s 1, every week during critical periods, such as summer/autumn, could be enough to avoid cyanobacteria blooms. Since freshwater ‘‘pulses’’ can be managed by operating the freshwater release from hydrotechnical structures, understanding the relationships between the periodicity and magnitude of inflow pulse events and the estuarine ecosystem structure and healthy functioning is a crucial step towards the development of management modelling tools, as proposed in this study...|$|R

The study {{is based on}} the standardized precipitation index (SPI) values, computed for 10 rainfall stations over the period 1987 – 2012, which corresponds to an observatory period of 25 <b>hydrologic</b> <b>years</b> (from September to August). The results obtained show a great variability in SPI values. The historical evolution of the SPI made it possible to define the periods of excess and deficit, corresponding to wet and dry periods respectively. The wet years were found to be 1989 – 1990, 1995 – 1996 and 2006 – 2007 while the dry years were 1987 – 1988, 1996 – 1997, 2000 – 2001, 2001 – 2002, 2007 – 2008, 2008 – 2009 and 2009 – 2010. This clearly shows alternating wet and dry periods, but with drought episodes taking prevalence over rainy fronts throughout the study period. Indeed, a high tendency towards a drop in precipitation and important sequences of drought were observed. Spatial variability of drought throughout Gabes Watershed was examined by geostatistical analysis of SPI, as drought and rainfall distribution vary with latitude, longitude, topography and proximity to the Mediterranean Sea. The results obtained showed that, compared to coastal and southern areas, drought was observed to be more important in the West and the North of Gabes Watershed. The SPI showed that moderate droughts are generally more frequent than severe or extreme droughts in most of the Watershed...|$|R
40|$|Historical {{trends in}} streamflow and climate were {{investigated}} for the Coldwater River watershed in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Temporal increases in rainfall and total precipitation during the spring, summer, and autumn periods, {{as well as}} on an annual basis, at the city of Merritt near the mouth of the watershed, and year-round temperature increases at this site, compare with declining summertime and annual streamflows at the nearby Merritt hydrometric station on the Coldwater River. Declining summer flows at this site could reflect the dominance of temporally increasing evaporation that is offsetting increased precipitation over the same periods of the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year.</b> Alternatively, increased water abstractions, altered regulation regimes, and/or land use changes in the watershed may also play significant/dominant roles. The relative absence of any coherent hydrological temporal patterns at the upstream Brookmere hydrometric station on the Coldwater River suggests that the net effects of warming temperatures, increasing precipitation, and any anthropogenic drivers over the past four decades are in approximate balance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEven in {{physically}} based distributed hydrological models, various remaining parameters must {{be estimated}} for each sub-catchment. This can involve tremendous effort, {{especially when the}} number of sub-catchments is large and the applied hydrological model is computationally expensive. Automatic parameter estimation tools can significantly facilitate the calibration process. Hence, we combined the nonlinear parameter estimation tool PEST with the distributed hydrological model WaSiM. PEST is based on the Gauss-Marquardt-Levenberg method, a gradient-based nonlinear parameter estimation algorithm. WaSiM is a fully distributed hydrological model using physically based algorithms for most of the process descriptions. WaSiM was applied to the alpine/prealpine Ammer River catchment (southern Germany, 710 km 2 in a 100 × 100 m 2 horizontal resolution. The catchment is heterogeneous in terms of geology, pedology and land use and shows a complex orography (the difference of elevation is around 1600 m). Using the developed PEST-WaSiM interface, the hydrological model was calibrated by comparing simulated and observed runoff at eight gauges for the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year</b> 1997 and validated for the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year</b> 1993. For each sub-catchment four parameters had to be calibrated: the recession constants of direct runoff and interflow, the drainage density, and the hydraulic conductivity of the uppermost aquifer. Additionally, five snowmelt specific parameters were adjusted for the entire catchment. Altogether, 37 parameters had to be calibrated. Additional a priori information (e. g. from flood hydrograph analysis) narrowed the parameter space of the solutions and improved the non-uniqueness of the fitted values. A reasonable quality of fit was achieved. Discrepancies between modelled and observed runoff were also due to the small number of meteorological stations and corresponding interpolation artefacts in the orographically complex terrain. Application of a 2 -dimensional numerical groundwater model partly yielded a slight decrease of overall model performance when compared to a simple conceptual groundwater approach. Increased model complexity therefore did not yield in general increased model performance. A detailed covariance analysis was performed allowing to derive confidence bounds for all estimated parameters. The correlation between the estimated parameters was in most cases negligible, showing that parameters were estimated independently from each other...|$|E
40|$|A {{model was}} {{developed}} to predict rootzone salinity under different irrigation practices on different soil types, with similar rainfall but different monthly distributions. A rootzone daily water and salt balance was performed using eight scenarios: two soil types (coarse-textured v. fine-textured), two multi-year series of actual rainfall data and two irrigation practices (surface with fixed number of irrigations and ET-based sprinkler irrigation). All factors influenced the mean electrical conductivity (EC) of the rootzone in the growing season (ECeS) : (i) Surface irrigation led to lower ECeS than sprinkler irrigation; (ii) Winterconcentrated rainfall caused lower ECeS than rainfall distributed uniformly throughout the year; and (iii) Coarser textured soil usually resulted in lower ECeS than the finer textured. The ECeS {{was related to the}} total precipitation of the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>year</b> and to the annual leaching fraction (LF), but surprisingly not to the seasonal LF. In most cases the model predicted lower ECeS than the FAO steady-state approach. Therefore considering these site-specific features could lead to lower leaching requirements and the safe use of higher salinity wate...|$|E
40|$|Deficit {{irrigation}} {{changes the}} process of field water transformation. Few previous studies discussed the soil water dynamics below the crop root zone {{and its impact on}} crop water consumption. In this study, field experiments of winter wheat-summer corn rotation under deficit irrigation were conducted at the typical farmland in Beijing. The process of crop water requirements and water conversion under deficit irrigation were simulated by the SWAP model after calibration and validation. Furthermore, the optimal deficit irrigation modes under the condition of different hydrological years were obtained based on this model. The results indicated that deficit irrigation made crop consumed large amount of soil water. When precipitation and irrigation were small, the soil water consumption could be accounted for 46. 1 % of crop water consumption. There was obvious soil water exchange between root zone and storage zone with the range of soil water flux from - 2. 67 to 0. 45 mm/d. However, the water flux at the lower boundary of storage zone was small and changed a little. The percolation of the root zone always occurred after irrigation or larger precipitation, and soil water was supplemented from the storage zone upward into the root zone at the critical period of crop water requirement. Compared with conventional irrigation, the optimal irrigation modes could save irrigation water of 375 mm, 225 mm and 225 mm, and the amount of drainage reduced up to 89 %, 17 % and 2 % in the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>years</b> of 75 %, 50 % and 25 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{urgent need}} for {{rational}} use of water resources and the intense competition among most of the riparian countries {{with respect to the}} use of shared water sources have raised the importance of examining the contribution of base flow to total stream flow. This paper examines the Diyala transboundary river basin shared between Iraq and Iran. Daily unregulated flow records during the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>years</b> between 1955 and 1982 were considered at the upstream flow gauging station and daily unimpaired flow time series during the water years between 1931 and 1961 were examined at the most downstream hydrometric station. Two digital filtering algorithms and the flow duration curve method were applied to extract the base flow time series and compute its signature to total river flow. A generic methodology, which incorporates the flow duration curve method within digital filtering algorithms, has been introduced to obtain the filter parameter α in the filtering algorithms, and obtain the base flow contribution {{with a high level of}} confidence. Findings revealed that the base flow proportion is 38 % for the upper sub-basin and 31 % for the upper and middle combined sub-basins. The computed base flow signatures using the incorporated approach have very strong correlation coefficients of around 0. 985. The driest year had the highest annual base flow index. The base flow index values started to increase in April and climbed to a peak by the end of May. A gradual decline between August and September was observed. The proposed methodology should be applied to unregulated watersheds...|$|R
