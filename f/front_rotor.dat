50|$|Tandem rotors are two {{horizontal}} {{main rotor}} assemblies mounted one behind the other. Tandem rotors achieve pitch attitude changes to accelerate and decelerate the helicopter {{through a process}} called cyclic pitch. To pitch forward and accelerate, both rotors increase the pitch at the rear and reduce the pitch at the front (cyclic)keeping torque the same on both rotors, flying sideways is achieved by increasing the pitch {{on one side and}} reducing pitch on the other. Yaw control develops through opposing cyclic pitch in each rotor. To pivot right, the <b>front</b> <b>rotor</b> tilts right and the rear rotor tilts left. To pivot left, the <b>front</b> <b>rotor</b> tilts left and the rear rotor tilts right. All rotor power contributes to lift, and it is simpler to handle changes in the center of gravity fore-aft. However, it requires the expense of two large rotors rather than the more common one large main rotor and a much smaller tail rotor. The Boeing CH-47 Chinook is the most common tandem rotor helicopter.|$|E

5000|$|On September 19, 1991, the {{fourth-generation}} Prelude {{was introduced}} in Japan, and released worldwide for the 1992 model year, European sales starting early in 1992. The car had a 58% front and 42% rear weight distribution. The four wheel steering system was changed to an electronic version and the engine was increased in capacity from 2.1 litres to 2.2 litres for the base model [...] "S" [...] (SOHC F22A1 engine, [...] at 5200 rpm, 203 Nm at 4000 rpm) and [...] "VTEC" [...] model (DOHC VTEC H22A1, [...] at 6800 rpm, 207 Nm at 5500 rpm), with a 2.3-litre for the [...] "Si" [...] (DOHC H23A1, [...] at 5800 rpm, 212 Nm at 5300 rpm). The Japanese Si came with the F22B (2.2 L DOHC non-VTEC, [...] ).

5000|$|Tandem rotor {{aerodynamics}} is {{a complex}} subject. Tandem rotor helicopters {{have the advantage of}} being able to hold more weight with shorter blades, since there are two sets. However, the rear rotor works in the aerodynamic shadow of the <b>front</b> <b>rotor,</b> which reduces its efficiency. This loss can be minimized by increasing the distance between the two rotor hubs, and by elevating one hub over the other. [...] Tandem rotor helicopters tend to have a lower disk loading than single rotor helicopters.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{issue with}} the beautifully styled Brembo [...] "scalloped" [...] big braking system is a flawed cooling design for the <b>front</b> <b>rotors</b> which warp under normal braking conditions.

50|$|For {{helicopters}} with contra-rotating rotors—also {{known as}} Coaxial mounted—one {{over the other}} on the same rotor shaft (Like a Kamov KA-50), helicopter control requires interaction between the two rotors. Howevererent rotor masts (Like a Boeing CH-47 Chinook) uses differential collective pitch to change the pitch attitude of the aircraft. To pitch nose down and accelerate forward, the pilot decreases collective pitch on the <b>front</b> <b>rotor</b> and increases collective pitch on the rear rotor proportionally. Conversely, the synchropter and transverse-mounted rotor counter rotating rotorcraft have two large horizontal rotor assemblies mounted side by side, (like a Bell/Boeing V-22 tilt rotor) helicopters use differential collective pitch to affect the roll of the aircraft. All of these configurations use differential cyclic pitch to control movement about the yaw axis, tilting the rotors in opposite directions to cause the aircraft to spin {{in the direction of the}} tilted rotors.|$|E

40|$|The {{rising cost}} of jet fuel has renewed {{interest}} in contrarotating open rotor propulsion systems. Contemporary design methods offer the potential to maintain the inherently high aerodynamic efficiency of open rotors while greatly reducing their noise output, something that was not feasible in the 1980 's designs. The primary source mechanisms of open rotor noise generation {{are thought to be}} the <b>front</b> <b>rotor</b> wake and tip vortex interacting with the aft rotor. In this paper, advanced measurement techniques and high-fidelity prediction tools are used to gain insight into the relative importance of the contributions to the open rotor noise signature of the <b>front</b> <b>rotor</b> wake and rotor tip vortex. The measurements include three-dimensional particle image velocimetry of the intra-rotor flowfield and the acoustic field of a model-scale open rotor. The predictions provide the unsteady flowfield and the associated acoustic field. The results suggest that while the <b>front</b> <b>rotor</b> tip vortex can have a significant influence on the blade passing tone noise produced by the aft rotor, the <b>front</b> <b>rotor</b> wake plays the decisive role in the generation of the interaction noise produced {{as a result of the}} unsteady aerodynamic interaction of the two rotors. At operating conditions typical of takeoff and landing operations, the interaction noise level is easily on par with that generated by the individual rotors, and in some cases is even higher. This suggests that a comprehensive approach to reducing open rotor noise should include techniques for mitigating the wake of the <b>front</b> <b>rotor</b> as well as eliminating the interaction of the <b>front</b> <b>rotor</b> tip vortex with the aft rotor blade tip...|$|E

During this investigation, blades of the F 4 /A 4 type were installed on the model which was operating in a freestream Mach 0. 72 regime, with the advance ratio of each rotor set at 2. 80.

40|$|The {{effects of}} three parameters, {{such as the}} {{combination}} of the number of blades of a <b>front</b> <b>rotor</b> and a rear rotor, the solidity and the blade tip clearance, on both the fluid dynamic and noise characteristics were experimentally investigated. As a result it was concluded that the noise due to the interaction between the <b>front</b> <b>rotor</b> and the rear rotor blades can be reduced if {{the combination of the}} number of two rotor blades is well selected.

40|$|There are two {{mechanisms}} {{giving rise}} to the dipole-type radiation of the turbulent noise generated from Jet fan. One is the strong turbulence induced by a <b>front</b> <b>rotor</b> which flows into the rear rotor, which, in tum, random force fluctuation on a rear rotor blade. Another is shedding of vortices from {{the trailing edge of}} the both front and rear rotors. In this paper, we take these two mechanisms into consideration to theoretically estimate the turbulent noise level. The estimated values agree well with the measured levels of turbulent noise generated by the Jet fan. It is theoretically clarified that the noise generated by the rear rotor is higher than that from the <b>front</b> <b>rotor.</b> The noise due to the turbulent flow is higher than that due to the vortex shedding from the trailing edge of the rotor...|$|E
40|$|A fine mesh Euler {{solution}} of the F 4 /A 4 unducted fan (UDF) model flowfield is compared with laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) data taken in the NASA Lewis 8 - by 6 -Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel. The comparison is made primarily at one axial plane downstream of the <b>front</b> <b>rotor</b> where the LDV particle lag errors are reduced. The agreement between measured and predicted velocities in this axial plane is good. The results show that a dense mesh is needed in the centerbody stagnation region to minimize entropy generation that weakens the aft row passage shock. The predicted radial location of the tip vortex downstream of the <b>front</b> <b>rotor</b> agrees well with the experimental results but the strength is overpredicted. With 40 points per chord line, the integrated performance quantities are nearly converged, but more points are needed to resolve passage shocks and flow field details...|$|E
