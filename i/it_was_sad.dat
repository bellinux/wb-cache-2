500|$|On July 30, {{almost two}} months after firing Dent at Fenway Park, Steinbrenner was {{suspended}} from day-to-day operations of the Yankees. There were cheers at both Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park over {{the news of the}} suspension of Steinbrenner. At Yankee Stadium, fans chanted and cheered [...] "It's Over! It's Over!" [...] However, the players said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> Steinbrenner was suspended.|$|E
500|$|Kerry Barrett and Carena Crawford of All About Soap said Charlie {{was both}} a [...] "sexy sergeant" [...] and the soap opera's [...] "cutest crime fighter". They opined that getting {{involved}} with Brax {{was never going to}} end well for Charlie but did not suspect she would die. The pair concluded that while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> for them, they were unsure how the residents of Summer Bay would manage without Charlie.|$|E
500|$|Barrymore's alcohol {{dependence}} meant most studios {{were unwilling to}} employ him, but MGM risked casting him {{in the role of}} Mercutio in their 1936 film Romeo and Juliet. To minimize disruption to the schedule, the studio put Barrymore in Kelley's Rest Home, a sanatorium for alcoholics, but he continued to drink covertly and was disruptive on set. Basil Rathbone, who was playing Tybalt, later recounted that [...] "he was drinking and unreliable on the set... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> to see him in such a state." [...] Opinions on his portrayal were divided. Some critics, such as Welford Beaton of the Hollywood Spectator, thought [...] "Barrymore is an acting gem", although Gielgud was uncomplimentary, writing to Peggy Ashcroft that [...] "Barrymore, who is like a monstrous old male impersonator jumping through a hoop, should really have been shot." ...|$|E

And {{everything}} is soft and vague and very <b>sad.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>sad,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>sad.</b> But everything has meaning," [...] thought Sandra Wentworth Williams, raising her head a little and looking very beautiful, tragic, and exalted. [...] "One must love everything." ...|$|R

500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; he said this about the call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't {{have any kind of}} blow-up." ...|$|E
500|$|Poe {{considered}} the hoax {{an opportunity to}} prove that Bostonians did not know good literature. Based on critical reaction, he believed he was right. The editor of the Boston Courier reviewed [...] "The Messenger Star" [...] as [...] "an elegant and classic production, based on the right principles, containing the essence of true poetry, mingled with a gorgeous imagination". When Poe claimed that he wrote the poem before he had turned 12, Cornelia Wells Walter of the Boston Evening Transcript wrote of her shock: [...] "A poem delivered before a literary association of adults, as written by a boy! Only think of it!" [...] It is unclear how old Poe {{was at the time}} he wrote the poem because, in part, he frequently changed his claim. Lewis Gaylord Clark said Poe's age at writing the poem was irrelevant and, though he admitted the audience did not know the author's age, [...] "they only knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> stuff". Modern biographer Daniel Stashower compared Poe's stunt with the story [...] "The Imp of the Perverse", in which Poe wrote about [...] "an earnest desire to tantalize a listener... The speaker is aware that he displeases." ...|$|E
500|$|Sinatra's {{decline in}} {{popularity}} was evident at his concert appearances. At a brief {{run at the}} Paramount in New York he drew small audiences. At the Desert Inn in Las Vegas he performed to half-filled houses of wildcatters and ranchers. At a concert at Chez Paree in Chicago, only 150 people in a 1,200-seat capacity venue turned up to see him. By April 1952 he was performing at the Kauai County Fair in Hawaii. Sinatra's relationship with Columbia Records was also disintegrating, with A executive Mitch Miller claiming he [...] "couldn't give away" [...] the singer's records. Though several notable recordings were made during this time period, such as [...] "If I Could Write a Book" [...] in January 1952, which Granata sees as a [...] "turning point", forecasting his later work with its sensitivity, Columbia and MCA dropped him later that year. His last studio recording for Columbia, [...] "Why Try To Change Me Now", was recorded in New York on September 17, 1952, with orchestra arranged and conducted by Percy Faith. [...] Journalist Burt Boyar observed, [...] "Sinatra had had it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sad.</b> From the top to the bottom in one horrible lesson." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2012, Manson {{confirmed}} that {{work on her}} solo album had been cancelled, stating the album [...] " [...] dead and buried. We had the funeral. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> and I cried a lot but it made such a beautiful corpse that we had an open casket." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2016 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Stefani expressed uncertainty {{with the future}} of No Doubt. [...] "I don't know what's {{going to happen with}} No Doubt. When Tony [...] and I are connected creatively, it's magic. But I think we've grown apart as far as what kind of music we want to make. I was really drained and burned out when we recorded that album [...] And I had a lot of guilt: 'I have to do it.' That's not the right setting to make music. There's some really great writing on that record. But the production felt really conflicted. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> how we all waited that long to put something out and it didn't get heard." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{wrote in}} May 1912 that Wittgenstein {{had just begun}} to study the history of philosophy: [...] "He expresses the most naive {{surprise}} that all the philosophers he once worshipped in ignorance are after all stupid and dishonest and make disgusting mistakes!" [...] The last time they saw each other was on 8 October 1913 at Lordswood House in Birmingham, then residence of the Pinsent family: [...] "I got up at 6.15 to see Ludwig off. He had to go very early – back to Cambridge – as he has lots to do there. I saw him off from the house in a taxi at 7.0 – to catch a 7.30 am train from New St Station. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> parting from him." [...] Wittgenstein left to live in Norway.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked how}} he beat his addictions, Cornell stated, [...] "It was {{a long period of}} coming to the {{realization}} that this way (sober) is better. Going through rehab, honestly, did help... it got me away from just the daily drudgery of depression and either trying to not drink or do drugs or doing them and you know, they give you such a simple message that any idiot can get and it's just over and over, {{but the bottom line is}} really, and this is the part that is scary for everyone, the individual kinda has to want it... not kinda, you have to want it and to not do that crap anymore or you will never stop and it will just kill you. There’s nothing you can do...if your best friend has a problem and it's very serious, there's nothing you're going to be able to do about it and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> for me and the people around me. Sad for me when friends of mine died because of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Visits {{from his}} mother to Likani were greatly enjoyable. In 1895, George and his mother visited Denmark. They had not seen their Danish {{relatives}} for four years. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sad</b> {{as it was the}} first time for both of them without the late Tsar. Then suddenly, his health deteriorated, [...] "Yesterday, in the garden, he expectorated some blood...that frightened me more than I can tell - the surprise of it was shocking, because he had been so well of late...I am quite desperate that this should have happened here" [...] As a result, George was forbidden to smoke and confined to bed until he was fit enough to return to Likani. Writing to Nicholas back home once again, George said about his trip to Denmark, [...] "Of course it was good to see the family after 4 years, but it did not really do me any good, as I lost more than 5 pounds which I had put on with such difficulty in May and June. I also get out of breath more easily. So these are the results of my trip. Very annoying." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Aukerman away at college, the Descendents added Ray Cooper as both {{singer and}} second guitarist. They {{performed}} with this lineup, and occasionally as a quintet when Aukerman would make return visits to Los Angeles. Stevenson {{pushed for the}} band to tour, which Navetta and Lombardo were against: [...] "Bill kind of sat down with me and Frank and {{said something to the}} effect of we were at a point where we needed to grow by going on the road", Lombardo later said. [...] "Frank said no, and I had to say no also, so he said he had to leave the band and we were both kind of bummed out. I don’t think Frank even believed him at first. That was a bad scenario." [...] Navetta, Lombardo, and Cooper tried to start a new band, the Ascendants. [...] "We played one show", said Lombardo. [...] "Frank played in his underwear, and I don’t mean boxers. It was all a disaster, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>sad,</b> for me anyway." [...] Navetta ultimately quit the band by setting all of his musical equipment on fire and moving to Oregon, where he became a full-time fisherman.|$|E

2500|$|Group member William [...] "Skoob" [...] Hines {{was raised}} in the {{neighborhood}} of Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Andre [...] "Krazy Drayz" [...] Weston, born in Jamaica, came to the United States as a child, growing up in Union City and Teaneck, New Jersey. Both rapped during their high school years, Hines with the group's future producer Derek Lynch's brother Tony. However, Lynch was Hines' DJ first and wouldn't begin producing until later. Hines and Weston began performing together after they met at Virginia State University in 1988. Hines and Weston met their freshman year on a road trip to another college through a mutual friend. According to Weston, the two became a duo after winning a campus contest which Hines suggested they enter together. Hines and Weston began to work with Brooklyn-based producers Chris Charity and Derek Lynch, both friends of Hines' from high school, who'd formed a production team using the name Solid Scheme Music at the time. According to Hines, aside from [...] "Klap Ya Handz" [...] and [...] "They Want EFX," [...] which was produced by Weston and he, all of the other instrumental tracks on the album were produced by Charity and Lynch. Around this time the group came up with its name which Weston noted was mostly Hines' idea. The name stemmed from an acronym of the two's nicknames, Skoob and Dray, and EFX from their constantly wanting their producers to add reverb to their vocals when in the studio. [...] "So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>Sad</b> EFX for a minute, but that didn't really make much sense, so we changed it to Das EFX." ...|$|E
