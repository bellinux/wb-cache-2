5|$|According to Hindu mythology, {{the lands}} of Kerala were {{recovered}} from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram ("The Land of Parasurama")). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded {{as far as it}} reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush <b>green</b> <b>land.</b> Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. The legend was later expanded, and found literary expression in the 17th or 18th century with Keralolpathi, which traces the origin of aspects of early Kerala society, such as land tenure and administration, to the story of Parasurama. In medieval times Kuttuvan may have emulated the Parasurama tradition by throwing his spear into the sea to symbolise his lordship over it.|$|E

40|$|Urban {{planning}} and management in economic, social, cultural, health and hygienic, and safety and security fields {{is one of the}} main concerns of officials and citizens in each country. Nowadays, the necessity of <b>green</b> <b>lands</b> in cities has become very important. <b>Green</b> <b>lands</b> refine the air and reduce air pollutants, strike ecological balance, and absorb piercing sickening sounds. Today, people are exposed to various psychological turmoil and ailments due to modern industrial life. Since one of the criteria for sustainable urban development is paying attention to the equal population distribution, <b>green</b> <b>lands</b> should be managed in such a way that spatial balance is prevailed. Since the city of Shiraz in Iran is located in a semi-arid climatic area, its population has been growing in recent years and efficient management of urban <b>green</b> <b>lands</b> seems vital to address and solve these problems. This study aims to examine the role of urban management in spatial distribution of <b>green</b> <b>lands</b> in a district in the city of Shiraz, Iran. To achieve the aim of the study, a reliable and valid questionnaire was distributed in district 8 in the city of Shiraz. This study is an applied research based on its purpose and analytical- descriptive case study according to its nature.

25|$|In the SimCity games, {{the player}} {{is given the}} task of {{founding}} and developing a city from a patch of <b>green</b> <b>land,</b> defining what buildings are constructed via development zones; residential zones for Sims to live in; commercial zones for Sims to shop and have offices within; industrial zones to provide work through factories, laboratories and farms - as well as ensuring their citizens are kept happy through establishing various services and amenities, all while keeping a stable budget. Since SimCity 2000, players are able to define zones by densities - low density for small buildings, medium density for low to mid-sized buildings, and high density for anything up to large tower blocks. SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, and SimCity 4 allow the player to alter the terrain of the city before building upon it. SimCitys game mechanics are based on 20th century California development, with each edition featuring similar gameplay elements. Players start from an undeveloped greenfield, cars are the default form of transportation, and earthquakes happen - but with some differences in what buildings, disasters and elements of city management are available.|$|E

60|$|One early April afternoon, in a Worcestershire field, {{the only}} field in that {{immediate}} landscape {{which was not}} down in grass, a man moved slowly athwart the furrows, sowing--a big man of heavy build, swinging his hairy brown arm with the grace of strength. He wore no coat or hat; a waistcoat, open over a blue-checked cotton shirt, flapped against belted corduroys that were somewhat {{the color of his}} square, pale-brown face and dusty hair. His eyes were sad, with the swimming yet fixed stare of epileptics; his mouth heavy-lipped, so that, but for the yearning eyes, the face would have been almost brutal. He looked as if he suffered from silence. The elm-trees bordering the field, though only just in leaf, showed dark against a white sky. A light wind blew, carrying already a scent from the earth and growth pushing up, for the year was early. The green Malvern hills rose in the west; and not far away, shrouded by trees, a long country house of weathered brick faced to the south. Save for the man sowing, and some rooks crossing from elm to elm, no life was visible in all the <b>green</b> <b>land.</b> And it was quiet--with a strange, a brooding tranquillity. The fields and hills seemed to mock the scars of road and ditch and furrow scraped on them, to mock at barriers of hedge and wall--between the <b>green</b> <b>land</b> and white sky was a conspiracy to disregard those small activities. So lonely was it, so plunged in a ground-bass of silence; so much too big and permanent for any figure of man.|$|E
60|$|In a deep {{curve of}} the {{mountains}} lay a breadth of <b>green</b> <b>land,</b> curtained by gentle tree-shadowed slopes leaning towards the rocky heights.

The rays of the newly-risen sun fell obliquely on the westward horn of this crescent-shaped nook: all else lay in dewy shadow. No sound came across the stillness; the very waters seemed to have curved themselves there for rest.|$|E

The sun was sparkling bright over a <b>green</b> <b>land,</b> full of trees and flowers.
