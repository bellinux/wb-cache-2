5|$|A {{saturated}} solution of equal parts of thallium(I) formate (Tl(CHO2)) and thallium(I) malonate (Tl(C3H3O4)) in water {{is known as}} Clerici solution. It is a mobile, odorless liquid which changes from yellowish to colourless upon reducing the concentration of the thallium salts. With a density of 4.25g/cm3 at 20°C, Clerici solution {{is one of the}} heaviest aqueous solutions known. It was used in the 20th century <b>for</b> <b>measuring</b> the density of minerals by the flotation method, but its use has discontinued due to the high toxicity and corrosiveness of the solution.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian sources, the {{official}} decision to launch Sputnik 2 {{was made on}} 10 or 12 October, leaving less than four weeks to design and build the spacecraft. Sputnik 2, therefore, {{was something of a}} rush job, with most elements of the spacecraft being constructed from rough sketches. Aside from the primary mission of sending a living passenger into space, Sputnik 2 also contained instrumentation <b>for</b> <b>measuring</b> solar irradiance and cosmic rays.|$|E

5|$|Carbohydrates are {{classified}} {{according to their}} glycemic index, a system <b>for</b> <b>measuring</b> how quickly a food that is eaten raises blood sugar levels, and glycemic load, which takes into account both the glycemic index {{and the amount of}} carbohydrate in the food. This has led to carbohydrate counting, a method used by diabetics for planning their meals.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium {{is used in}} {{dosimeters}} <b>for</b> <b>measuring</b> ionizing radiation. Crystals {{of calcium}} sulfate or calcium fluoride are doped with dysprosium. When these crystals are exposed to radiation, the dysprosium atoms become excited and luminescent. The luminescence can be measured to determine the degree of exposure to which the dosimeter has been subjected.|$|E
5|$|Earlier methods <b>for</b> <b>measuring</b> {{convergence}} incorporate {{ratios of}} phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} convergence. One drawback {{to keep in mind}} is that these methods can confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.|$|E

5|$|German {{astronomer}} Johann Bode {{defined the}} constellation Lochium Funis, the Log and Line—a nautical device once used <b>for</b> <b>measuring</b> speed and distance travelled at sea—around Pyxis in his 1801 star atlas, but the depiction did not survive. In 1844 John Herschel attempted to resurrect the classical configuration of Argo Navis by renaming it Malus the Mast, a suggestion followed by Francis Baily, but Benjamin Gould restored Lacaille's nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Reines took {{most of his}} {{neutrino}} {{research team}} {{with him when he}} left for the new University of California, Irvine (UCI), becoming its first dean of physical sciences.

5|$|In the {{interests}} of standardising health-related units of measure used in the nuclear industry, the 12th CGPM (1964) accepted the continued use of the curie (symbol Ci) as a non-SI unit of activity for radionuclides; the becquerel, sievert and gray were adopted in later years. Similarly, the millimetre of mercury (symbol mmHg) was retained <b>for</b> <b>measuring</b> blood pressure.|$|E

5|$|Michael Walker of the Fraser Institute and Friedman {{hosted a}} series of {{conferences}} from 1986 to 1994. The goal {{was to create a}} clear definition of economic freedom and a method <b>for</b> <b>measuring</b> it. Eventually this resulted in the first report on worldwide economic freedom, Economic Freedom in the World. This annual report has since provided data for numerous peer-reviewed studies and has influenced policy in several nations.|$|E
5|$|Outer {{space is}} a {{convenient}} setting <b>for</b> <b>measuring</b> {{the speed of}} light because of its large scale and nearly perfect vacuum. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the solar system, such as the radius of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units. It is customary to express the results in astronomical units (AU) per day.|$|E
5|$|Self-awareness {{appears to}} be a sign of {{abstract}} thinking. Self-awareness, although not well-defined, is believed to be a precursor to more advanced processes such as metacognitive reasoning. The traditional method <b>for</b> <b>measuring</b> this is the mirror test, which determines if an animal possesses the ability of self-recognition. Mammals that have 'passed' the mirror test include Asian elephants (some pass, some do not); chimpanzees; bonobos; orangutans; humans, from 18 months (mirror stage); bottlenose dolphins killer whales; and false killer whales.|$|E

5|$|The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, BDI-1A, BDI-II), {{created by}} Aaron T. Beck, is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory, {{one of the}} most widely used psychometric tests <b>for</b> <b>measuring</b> the {{severity}} of depression. Its development marked a shift among mental health professionals, who had until then, viewed depression from a psychodynamic perspective, instead of it being rooted in the patient's own thoughts.|$|E
5|$|The disks of most {{stars are}} much too small in angular size to be {{observed}} with current ground-based optical telescopes, and so interferometer telescopes are required to produce images of these objects. Another technique <b>for</b> <b>measuring</b> the angular size of stars is through occultation. By precisely measuring the drop in brightness of a star as it is occulted by the Moon (or the rise in brightness when it reappears), the star's angular diameter can be computed.|$|E
