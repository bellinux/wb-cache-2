25|$|The Second Great Awakening began around 1790. It gained {{momentum}} by 1800. After 1820, membership rose rapidly among Baptist and Methodist congregations, whose preachers led the movement. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>past</b> {{its peak}} {{by the late}} 1840s.

It enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations.|$|E

In the first line Pajol's Light, and Excelmaks' Heavy, Cavalry, formed the right wing, and Vandamme's Corps, the left; while Gérard's Corps which had not received the order to march until 09:30 arrived much later, and occupied the centre. 7th Division (Girard's) was detached some little distance on the extreme left the Imperial Guard and Milhaud's Corps of Cuirassiers constituted the second line.|$|E

It was only 3 months but such a sweet little thing… It was still alive this morning; when I called in the {{afternoon}} they beckoned me {{in to see the}} tiny thing laid out, with a white flower in its wee hand. To me it seemed a “murdered innocent”. And an hour or two after another child died.|$|E
2500|$|In 1898, Campau was {{reunited with}} Gus Schmelz, {{who was then}} {{managing}} the Minneapolis Millers. [...] He was released by Minneapolis in June and immediately signed with Charles Comiskey, owner of the St. Paul Apostles. [...] He played only two months at St. Paul before he was released and then signed by the Kansas City Blues. [...] Kansas City won the Western League championship that year. [...] Campau's fielding error {{in the second game}} of the three-game championship series nearly cost Kansas City the championship. [...] Campau later recalled that the costly error occurred when the sun was directly in his eyes in right field, and he had not even seen the ball until <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>past</b> him.|$|E
2500|$|Egyptian Camel Transport Corps not {{required}} by the fighting troops accompanied the evacuation of the wounded down the Umm Esh Shert track, preparatory to {{the withdrawal of the}} whole force. Camels, slow and sometimes obstinate beasts, made barely [...] an hour moving in single file down the precipitous goat path of Umm esh Shert. Their feet, more suited to sand, were cut and bruised by the sharp stones and slippery rocks of the path. Groaning and protesting, the unwieldy beasts lurched perilously down the track. Every now and then one of them would stop short, blocking the way for those behind it and refuse obstinately to move on. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>past</b> mid-day before the last camel had cleared Es Salt ...|$|E

2500|$|The Viet Cong bodies {{sparked the}} first of what would be many controversies that came from the battle. Following what was {{standard}} procedure, Col Hathaway gave orders for the 15 VC KIA to be buried [...] "before they became a health hazard." [...] Major Donald Potter, 1-46 Inf's executive officer, issued instructions that the bodies be buried in an eroded section near the resupply LZ. For reasons that never become clear, five of the bodies were transported instead to the base trash dump. By the time this was noticed, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>past</b> 1200 and the bodies were beginning to bloat in the heat. Rather than move the bodies again, Maj Potter instructed the commander of Company D to [...] "go on and burn them down there in the trash dump." [...] Burning the bodies of enemy combatants is considered a war crime, but Potter did not seem to realize this.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing the SEC's July 2008 {{emergency}} order, Barron's {{said in an}} editorial: [...] "Rather than fixing any of {{the real}} problems with the agency and its mission, Cox and his fellow commissioners waved a newspaper and swatted the imaginary fly of naked short-selling. It made a big noise, but there's no dead bug." [...] Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal said the order was [...] "an exercise in symbolic confidence-building" [...] and that naked shorting involved technical concerns except for subscribers to a [...] "devil theory". The Economist said the SEC had [...] "picked the wrong target", mentioning a study by Arturo Bris of the Swiss International Institute for Management Development who found that trading in the 19 financial stocks became less efficient. The Washington Post expressed approval of the SEC's decision to address a [...] "frenetic shadow world of postponed promises, borrowed time, obscured paperwork and nail-biting price-watching, usually compressed into a few high-tension days swirling around the decline of a company." [...] The Los Angeles Times called the practice of naked short selling [...] "hard to defend," [...] and stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>past</b> time the SEC became active in addressing market manipulation.|$|E
2500|$|An {{artillery}} bombardment, between 19:00 and 19:30 {{opened up}} the French attack, with Oudinot launching {{a part of his}} II Corps against the Austrian II Korps under Prince Hozenzollern. The Austrian defenders were prepared for the attack: Hohenzollern had deployed his men in two lines, with a heavy skirmisher screen and was occupying a naturally strong position, which had been reinforced with earthworks. The Austrian Korps had also deployed its powerful artillery of 68 pieces. Nevertheless, the French crossed the Russbach stream, spearheaded by Frère's division, which managed to reach the outskirts of the small village of Baumersdorf. This village, consisting of no more than 30 wooden houses and a bridge, soon caught fire from the French artillery bombardment, but the Austrian defenders from Hardegg's brigade (8th Jäger regiment and a battalion of Volunteers from the Erzherzog Karl Legion) stood their ground, despite the flames. Unable to storm the position with Frère's division, Oudinot launched a flanking attack {{to the right of the}} village, with some of his best troops: the 57th Line regiment (styled [...] "the Terrible") and the 10th Light regiment, both from Grandjean's division. The 57th Line valiantly assaulted the village from the east and occupied its first houses, where they had to stop. Meanwhile, the 10th Light crossed the Russbach downstream and, after passing through the boggy terrain below the escarpment, began to make its way up the slope. As the 10th Light was coming up towards the village, they were at first greeted with intense artillery fire and then Buresch's brigade released some heavy musketry upon them. This disordered the ranks of the French regiment, which began to waver and the last straw came when they saw Prince Hohenzollern personally leading the 500 cavalrymen from the Vincent Chevaulegers regiment against them: the 10th Light panicked and fled, taking the 57th Line with them. After a disorderly retreat, the two regiments stopped and reformed when they met the steady ranks of the Imperial Guard, towards Raasdorf. By now, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>past</b> 20:00, night was falling and Oudinot had been repulsed with significant losses.|$|E

2500|$|Next morning, Thursday, Sasun Eff. {{came in at}} 10; I {{took him}} {{straight}} to Sir Percy and left them. Half an hour later, he returned {{and told me that}} he had accepted and I understood the full significance of the Nunc Dimittis. He asked me what he could now do to help and I sent him straight to the Naqib. The leading Shi'ah of Baghdad had also refused to join the Council and it was essential to get him in. In the midst of this talk Sir Percy sent for me. I left Sasun to Mr Philby and went to consult with Sir Percy. We agreed that I should send at once for Ja'far, tell him what had happened and bid him bestir himself. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>past</b> one o'clock before I caught Ja'far. We had the most extraordinary conversation. He told me he had come into the Cabinet, only to defeat Talib, that he distrusted and loathed him and regarded it as shameful that he should be one of the leading persons of Mesopotamia. I said that the Mesopotamians themselves had made him, by their fear and their servility, and that it was for them to unmake him if they wished. We then discussed how to win over the extremists, I assured him that that was Sir Percy's chief desire and taking heart, he asked if he might talk to Sir Percy. I took him at once to Sir Percy and left them together, with the assured conviction that Sir Percy was the best exponent of his own policy.”… “Oh, if we can pull this thing off! rope together the young hotheads, and the Shi'ah obscurantists, and enthusiasts like Ja'far, polished old statesmen like Sasun, and scholars like Shukri—if we can make them work together and find their own salvation for themselves, what a fine thing it will be.
