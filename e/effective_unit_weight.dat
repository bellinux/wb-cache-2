Combined with the typical landslide geology, several groundwork anti-leakage were studied for earth-rock dam, correlative processes and technologies were discussed, and construction parameters were designed.

40|$|SUMMARY: Knowledge of the <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of Municipal Solid-Waste (MSW) is {{required}} for many engineering analyses. However, <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> {{continues to be a}} significant source of uncertainty in these analyses due to a variety of factors, including the heterogeneous nature of solid waste, a paucity of data, and the lack of systematic analysis of the available data. Analysis of available in-situ and laboratory data on the <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of MSW, described herein, indicates both the existence of a “characteristic <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> profile ” for MSW and the need for site-specific <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> data to develop an accurate <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> profile for a particular landfill.

The inputs used in {{the run of the}} LLP 99 model were: • single soil layer, • very high flexural stiffness of pile (1, 000, 000 kN/m 2). • pile width = 0. 3 m (i. e. wooden pile), • shear strength in the absence of lateral stress (for unconsolidated sand 150 kN/m 2 was used), • <b>effective</b> <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of soil (15 kN/m 3), • active lateral effective stress coefficient (used 0. 426 based on coefficient of earth pressure at rest for sand with = 35 °), • neutral lateral effective shear stress coefficient (used default – 1), • passive lateral effective stress coefficient (= 1 / active lateral stress coefficient = 2. 35), and • stroke displacement between active and passive stress (used default 0. 02 m). Loading steps of 1 kN were applied at 1 m above the pile interception with the pre-scour bed level. The moment for each loading step is based on a maximum scour hole depth of 3. 5 m, hence the moment arm is 4. 5 m (i. e. moment = 4. 5 kNm for each loading step). The depth of pile was varied in order to determine an effective pile depth for securing LWD. The pile deflection was limited for all pile depths considered (Table 7). For piles constructed 1 m below the maximum scour depth, the piles should not deflect more than 1 cm under the bankfull flow. In practice we would recommend that piles be driven an extra metre to account for any underestimation in maximum scour depth. The recommended pile depth is, therefore, the maximum depth of scour (3. 5 m) plus 2 m, or 5. 5 m from the pre-scour bed level for securing in-stream wood. Table 7.

For this, the suitable datasets have been collected from the literatures and prepared for modeling. The data were used to construct a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network to approximate the unknown nonlinear relationship between the input parameters and HDZ. The MLP proposed model predicted values in enough agreements with the measured ones in a satisfactory correlation, in which, a high conformity (R 2 = 0. 989) was observed. To approve the capability of proposed ANN model, the obtained results are compared {{to the results of}} the conventional regression analysis (CRA) method. The calculated performance evaluation indices show the higher level of accuracy of the proposed ANN model compared to CRA. For further evaluation, the ANN model results are compared with the results of available models and in-situ measurements reported in literatures. Comparative results present a logical agreement between ANN model and available methods. Obtained results remark that the proposed ANN model is a suitable tool in HDZ estimation.

The Ohio's and the modified Ohio's curves can predict satisfactorily the compaction curves of the fine-grained soils, and lateritic soils and crushed rocks {{consistent with the}} grade B of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) requirement. The CBR value of a specific soil {{is directly related to}} the relative dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> (the ratio of dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> to maximum dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight,</b> γd/γd,max). The field compaction result of a fine-grained soil at the optimum water content, OWC, shows that initially the dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> increases rapidly with the number of roller passes and the relationship between dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> and number of roller passes is represented by the logarithm function. Finally, the dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> reaches a constant value, which is close to the laboratory maximum dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight.</b> Even with a large number of roller passes (compaction energy), the dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> cannot be enhanced further because the soil state approaches the zero air void state.

Current research tried to evaluate the effect of compaction <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> on the pore size and pore volume along with consolidation and swell characteristics on two expansive clays from semi-arid environment. The two selected clays represent soils with different degrees of expansion, particle size and mineralogy. Pore size characterization for these two soils was performed using Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry, while swell and consolidation characteristics were determined using a conventional oedometer test. Samples for both tests were compacted at different <b>unit</b> <b>weights</b> including, 100, 95, 90, 80, 75, and 70 % of maximum dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> (MDUW) obtained from standard proctor.

In this paper, the LSA value can be expressed by a FOS value, which is the ratio of forces that make the slope fail and those that prevent the slope from failing. A geotechnical engineering properties data base has been developed {{on the basis of a}} series of parameter maps such as <b>effective</b> cohesion (C’), <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of soil (g), depth of failure surface (Z), height of ground water table (Zw), Zw/Z dimensionless (m), <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of water (gw), slope surface inclination (?) and effective angle of shearing resistance (f). Taking into consideration the cause of the landslide, identified as groundwater change, two scenarios of landslide activity were studied. Scenario 1 considered the minimum groundwater level recorded corresponding to the actual situation of the most recent landslide while Scenario 2 considered the reverse. A simple method (infinite slope model) for error propagation was {{used to calculate the}} variance of the FOS and the probability that will be less than 1 for each pixel.

The prediction accuracy was 81 % and 85 %, respectively. In general for both factors, the LSA 2 map showed higher accuracy compared to the LSA 1 map.
