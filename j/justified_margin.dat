40|$|Methods of {{presenting}} information automatically are, by and large, limited to variations of tabular form. Reading {{a sequence of}} lines and understanding their import is a tedious job reminding people of the old adage, 2 ̆ 7 A picture is worth a thousand words. 2 ̆ 7 As a result, efforts are now being directed toward presenting such data graphically. Unfortunately, using graphic devices can be a complex process, requiring days or even weeks of training {{in the area of}} Computer Graphics. Until recently it has been difficult for a naive user to create a graphic display of information. ^ The long range goal of this research is to have an intelligent system which helps users in the graphical display of data by performing the task of a graphic artist. One immediate problem {{is that there is a}} gap between the way a user conceives of a graphic display and the way the machine does. Another problem is that often a user will not think to make explicit what s/he does not care about or what s/he believes the system already knows or is able to infer. What is needed is a graphic-expert system that, on the one hand, is at an appropriate conceptual level to state those things that the user cares about and, on the other, provides appropriate defaults to take care of what the user considers to be trivial or obvious. ^ The immediate objective, accomplished in this research, involves the automatic selection of graphic display formats. This selection is based on the formally characterizable properties of the data to be displayed, the user 2 ̆ 7 s particular objectives, principles of graphic design and the results of studies in the area of human factors and effective displays. ^ The major contributions of this research lie in solving the joint problems of (1) deducing, in lieu of explicit specification from a user, an effective graphic presentation of tabular data, and (2) identifying design factors that are necessary to decide upon an effective display format for the given information. The contributions in these two areas derive directly from the method that is suggested in this thesis of formalizing the way that tabular data is viewed. ^ The most significant point of this work is the new direction toward providing automatic graphic displays. Until now, the emphasis has been on enhancing systems for automatic textual display so that they are easily usable by non-programmers and can provide defaults including, for example, automatic paging and right <b>justified</b> <b>margins.</b> This research has established the groundwork for developing automatic graphic display systems for naive users by providing the same or greater degree of default capabilities and ease of use. ...|$|R
40|$|FMS (fixed-to-mobile substitution) has {{increasingly}} been echoed within the regulatory {{agenda of the}} global and domestic policy actors as the usage of mobile telephony has rapidly exceeded that of the fixed telephony in the last decade. In this line of thinking and upon the drastic changes in market figures, e. g., diminishing fixed subscriber number and traffic, Information and Communication Technologies Authority (ICTA), regulatory authority in Turkey has had a survey carried out {{across the country in}} 2013, primarily to evaluate the degree of FMS. The survey results demonstrated the existence of one-sided (or imperfect) FMS, which has been found to influence fixed access and calling markets so as to ensure that these two markets are more competitive under a forward-looking approach. Moreover, ICTA has advanced the wholesale regulations within the context of fixed call origination market by imposing margin squeeze remedy on the fixed incumbent (SMP operator). While the latter step is criticized as being in conflict with the deregulation decision, the nature of the remedy being on ex post basis could be speculated to eliminate the concerns to an extent. Aggravating the discussion, an interesting development during the course of ICTA 2 ̆ 019 s intervention has happened in January 2015 when the SMP operator has increased its two retail prices so as to rearrange the margins. In this context, two questions arise from the discussions which extend to the philosophy of market regulation and deregulation: (i) First, does the regulator have a responsibility to pursue a regular (although being ex post) way of examining and when necessary intervening the incumbent 2 ̆ 019 s retail prices despite the fact Competition Authority has opened investigations several times on the same issue. (ii) Would the exposed degree of FMS have had a driving role for deregulation of fixed access and calling markets, which are freed from regulation including margin squeeze remedy on a different route across EU, i. e. mostly inner-market (or VOB-driven) developments towards effective competition. In this paper, such debates are addressed under the light of the reasons that <b>justify</b> <b>margin</b> squeeze as well as deregulation acts issued both by the Turkish regulator itself and in general way of regulatory understanding, i. e. with a particular emphasis to EU perspective and implementation. It is elaborated whether the underlined concerns relating to the degree of market regulation are successfully sorted out and translated into regulatory practice, specifically when thought with Turkey-centric competition problems, i. e. predominant WLR type service-based models, diminishing fixed markets. After discussions, it is found that although belatedly imposed and accompanied by deregulation, such a remedy would serve as a check-balance tool for a transition period, but not suffice to cover all the long-term problems by itself in cases where competing operators have insufficient competitive tools in terms of replicability. Last but not the least it is concluded that although European way of deregulation draws a differing roadmap, EU-centric pillars for regulation are implicitly injected into the Turkish system, which tries to resolve the issue with a trade-off together with the little possibility of ruling in a regulatory vacuum. Should this and a comparable risk of regulatory opportunism be prevented, a hybrid and promising example would be mentioned under the context of deregulatory reform...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 The nuclear {{industry}} has long relied upon bounding parametric analyses {{in predicting the}} safety margins of reactor designs undergoing design-basis accidents. These methods {{have been known to}} return highly-conservative results, limiting the operating conditions of the reactor. The Best-Estimate Plus Uncertainty (BEPU) method using a modernized version of the Code-Scaling, Applicability, and Uncertainty (CSAU) methodology has been applied to more accurately predict the safety margins of the Oregon State University Advanced Plant Experiment (APEX) facility experiencing a Loss-of-Feedwater Accident (LOFA). The statistical advantages of the Bayesian paradigm of probability was utilized to incorporate prior knowledge when determining the analysis required to <b>justify</b> the safety <b>margins.</b> RELAP 5 Mod 3. 3 was used to accurately predict the thermal-hydraulics of a primary Feed-and-Bleed response to the accident using assumptions to accompany the lumped-parameter calculation approach. A novel coupling of thermal-hydraulic and statistical software was accomplished using the Symbolic Nuclear Analysis Package (SNAP). Uncertainty in Peak Cladding Temperature (PCT) was calculated at the 95 / 95 probability/confidence levels under a series of four separate sensitivity studies...|$|R
40|$|While {{more than}} a decade ago reactor and thermal {{hydraulic}} calculations were tedious and often needed a lot of approximations and simplifications that forced the designers to take a very conservative approach, computational resources available nowadays allow engineers to cope with increasingly complex problems in a reasonable time. The use of best-estimate calculations provides tools to <b>justify</b> convenient engineering <b>margins,</b> reduces costs, and maximises economic benefits. In this direction, a suite of coupled best-estimate specific calculation codes was developed to analyse the behaviour of the Atucha II nuclear power plant in Argentina. The developed tool includes three-dimensional spatial neutron kinetics, a channel-level model of the core thermal hydraulics with subcooled boiling correlations, a one-dimensional model of the primary and secondary circuits including pumps, steam generators, heat exchangers, and the turbine with all their associated control loops, and a complete simulation of the reactor control, limitation, and protection system working in closed-loop conditions as a faithful representation of the real power plant. In the present paper, a description of the coupling scheme between the codes involved is given, and some examples of their application to Atucha II are shown...|$|R
40|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union and the 9 / 11 attacks, the landscape of the freedom of religion has changed. The issues now facing freedom of religion varies greatly from the issues that the drafters of the universal declaration of human rights faced after World War II. In the light of the new issues that States face in the intersection of religion and societal interest, scholars have criticized the European Court of Human Rights to give too much leeway to the States in determining how the human rights should be implemented, by using the doctrine of margin of appreciation. Critics of the margin of appreciation claim that it is based on culture relativism and that the doctrine undermines the universality of the human rights. In order to decide if the margin of appreciation has indeed led to a relativization of the human rights I compared it to the jurisprudence of the UN Human Rights Committee and its use of the Syracusa principles. My conclusion is that the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights cannot be considered to be based on culture relativism. The jurisprudence of the UN Human Rights Committee is not entirely universal given that the contracting states can make reservation to articles in the ICCPR, which excludes the UN Committee’s jurisdiction of that specific provision in the treaty. Both the European Court and the UN Comittee has to balance their jurisdiction with sovereignty of the its member states and therefore it is inevitable that some leeway must be given to the member states, First of all, to decide whether the margin of appreciation is a sympton of culture relativity in a specific case, the Europan Court has to improve their way of describing and <b>justifying</b> how the <b>margin</b> of appreciation is used. Secondly, I will discuss the necessity to review the relationship between universalism and culture relativism in order to better understand international human rights law. ...|$|R
40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) is {{major cause of}} blindness in Americans aged 50 years and up. In 2010, {{there were more than}} 2 million cases of AMD in the United States and the National Eye Institute projects that there will be nearly 5. 5 million cases per year by 2050. The more detrimental form of AMD, the “wet” form, is caused by the development of new blood vessels within the macular region of the eye, a condition known as choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Several treatment modalities are available for AMD, however the most common is laser photocoagulation in which the abnormal blood vessels are coagulated using a high intensity laser as a heating source. While this treatment modality is effective, high temperatures within the deep eye tissue can cause unwanted collateral damage. Optimizing this thermal treatment thus amounts to minimizing the duration of treatment such that the abnormal blood vessels are destroyed but damage to other tissues is minimized. One possible extension was also explored in this study which is the injection of highly absorbent dye into the abnormal feeder vessel to improve the laser absorbance. The model used in this study employs a 3 D Cartesian geometry over which Pennes bioheat equation is solved for the temperature profile over a time scale of 1 second. The thermal damage is then analyzed by observing the temperature history in abnormal and healthy tissue with the goal of achieving a cumulative effective number of minutes at 43 oC greater than 80 minutes within the target tissue, the feeder vessel, while minimizing the thermal damage elsewhere. Results from the model suggest that after 1 second of laser application, temperatures in the feeder vessel rapidly rise to a maximum of 67 oC and temperatures in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) rise to 86 oC. In the hottest section of the feeder vessel, that section which is directly exposed {{to the center of the}} laser spot, the desired thermal damage is achieved within 0. 55 s. The model was assessed for sensitivity to thermal properties as well as the absorbance coefficient, μa, in the feeder vessel and RPE sections. Results from this analysis suggested a change in temperature of less than 0. 5 % when these parameters were varied within the reasonable limits found in the literature. This suggests good applicability of the results to individual patients. The use of dye to target and improve heat transfer is a novel improvement to the existing photocoagulation process. To assess the efficacy of such a modification, the absorbance coefficient was increased from 4610 m- 1 to 9000 m- 1 to simulate the effect of the dye. The results show very little variation in feeder vessel temperatures suggesting that dye assisted photocoagulation is not a large improvement from the current process. The effect of blood flow velocity was also assessed in this study. As expected, it was found that increasing blood flow velocity shifted the maximum temperature in the feeder vessel along the direction of flow and resulted in slightly lower maximum feeder vessel temperatures as the blood cools the feeder vessel by convection. The results of this study suggest that shorter treatment times may be useful in reducing collateral tissue damage, however a treatment time of 1 second is <b>justified</b> as a <b>margin</b> of safety to ensure complete destruction of the desired tissue...|$|R
