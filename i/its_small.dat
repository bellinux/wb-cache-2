5|$|Because of <b>its</b> <b>small</b> size, Hale Barns has few schools. Amongst {{them are}} St Ambrose College which {{provides}} education for 11- to 18-year-olds and Elmridge Primary.|$|E
5|$|After {{rounding}} Widmouth Head, {{the path}} passes 'The Coastguard Cottages' in Hele Bay {{and enters the}} seaside resort of Ilfracombe, with <b>its</b> <b>small</b> harbour, surrounded by cliffs. A seasonal foot passenger ferry service runs from the harbour to Lundy Island, and the Balmoral, the Waverley and pleasure boats ply to Porthcawl near Swansea. From Ilfracombe to Bideford the Tarka Trail coincides with the South West Coast Path.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{distance}} of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, {{the smallest of the}} Solar System planets. <b>Its</b> <b>small</b> apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).|$|E
5000|$|Atropa pallidiflora {{differs from}} Atropa {{belladonna}} chiefly in its glabrescence (lack of hairs), also in its narrower leaves, <b>its</b> <b>smaller</b> yellow flowers with shorter pedicels and <b>its</b> <b>smaller</b> berries (always yellow, {{in the fresh}} state?) ...|$|R

5|$|Beryllium's {{chemical}} {{behavior is}} largely a result of <b>its</b> <b>small</b> atomic and ionic radii. It thus has very high ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are covalent. It is more chemically similar to aluminium than its close neighbors in the periodic table due to having a similar charge-to-radius ratio.|$|E
5|$|Dactyl shares many {{characteristics}} with Ida. Their albedos {{and reflection}} spectra are very similar. The small differences {{indicate that the}} space weathering process is less active on Dactyl. <b>Its</b> <b>small</b> size would make the formation of significant amounts of regolith impossible. This contrasts with Ida, which is covered by a deep layer of regolith.|$|E

5|$|In flight, the red-throated loon has a {{distinctive}} profile; <b>its</b> <b>small</b> feet do not project far past {{the end of}} its body, its head and neck droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are angled back. It has a quicker, deeper wingbeat than do other loons.|$|E
5|$|In late 1941, the Einsatzkommandos {{settled into}} {{headquarters}} in Kovno, Riga, and Tallinn. Einsatzgruppe A grew less mobile and faced problems because of <b>its</b> <b>small</b> size.

5|$|The Company briefly {{considered}} {{sending a}} revived 2nd Rhodesia Regiment to the Western Front, but the British Army promptly rejected this idea, {{saying that the}} unit would be impractical for trench warfare because of <b>its</b> <b>small</b> size.

5|$|The Museum of Islamic Art (Musée d'Art Islamique) is a blue-coloured {{building}} {{located in}} the Marjorelle Gardens. The private museum was created by Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé {{in the home of}} Jacques Majorelle, who had his art studio there. Recently renovated, <b>its</b> <b>small</b> exhibition rooms have displays of Islamic artifacts and decorations including Irke pottery, polychrome plates, jewellery, and antique doors.|$|E
5|$|The Orangi Pilot Project {{was very}} {{different}} from the Comilla Academy. OPP was a private body, dependent for <b>its</b> <b>small</b> fixed budget on another NGO. The vast resources and support of the government, Harvard advisors, MSU, and Ford Foundation was missing. OPP possessed no authority, no sanctions. It may observe and investigate but it could only advise, not enforce.|$|E
50|$|No general {{method is}} known for {{determining}} whether a number is friendly or solitary. The smallest number whose classification is unknown (as of 2009) is 10; it is conjectured to be solitary; if not, <b>its</b> <b>smallest</b> friend is a fairly large number, like the status for the number 24, although 24 is friendly, <b>its</b> <b>smallest</b> friend is 91,963,648.|$|R
50|$|The galaxy, {{viewed from}} almost face on, {{appears to be}} {{in the midst of a}} merger with <b>its</b> <b>smaller</b> {{companion}} galaxy, NGC 153. The galaxy has several bright, blue, dusty spiral arms filled with active star formation.

5|$|The {{innermost}} cortical layer, the zona reticularis, lies directly {{adjacent to}} the medulla. It produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to testosterone) in humans. <b>Its</b> <b>small</b> cells form irregular cords and clusters, separated by capillaries and connective tissue. The cells contain relatively small quantities of cytoplasm and lipid droplets, and sometimes display brown lipofuscin pigment.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{chemistry of}} boron {{is dominated by}} <b>its</b> <b>small</b> atomic size, and relatively high ionization energy. With only three valence electrons per boron atom, simple covalent bonding cannot fulfil the octet rule. Metallic bonding is the usual result among the heavier congenors of boron but this generally requires low ionization energies. Instead, because of <b>its</b> <b>small</b> size and high ionization energies, the basic structural unit of boron (and nearly all of its allotropes) is the icosahedral B12 cluster. Of the 36 electrons associated with 12 boron atoms, 26 reside in 13 delocalized molecular orbitals; the other 10 electrons are used to form two- and three-centre covalent bonds between icosahedra. The same motif can be seen, as are deltahedral variants or fragments, in metal borides and hydride derivatives, and in some halides.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} saprobic, and is found growing in {{groups on the}} ground or on moss-covered {{decaying}} wood, especially amongst fallen pine needles. In North America, fruit bodies appear in the spring and summer, and are fairly common; in Britain, the fungus fruits from winter to spring, and is rare. <b>Its</b> <b>small</b> size and dark color makes it easy to overlook.|$|E

50|$|Agricultural {{unmanned}} helicopter {{is another}} UAV developed by Divine Horse, {{and it was}} originally intended for agricultural applications such as crop dusting. The agricultural unmanned helicopter {{is larger than the}} unmanned helicopter, and capable of carrying a greater payload, and like <b>its</b> <b>smaller</b> cousin, it also utilizes a COTS airframe. Agricultural unmanned helicopter has a conventional helicopter layout with a pair of skids as landing gear. Although originally intended mainly for agricultural applications, it can also be adopted for other missions such as aerial photography and surveys like <b>its</b> <b>smaller</b> cousin. However, unlike <b>its</b> <b>smaller</b> cousin, the agricultural unmanned helicopter does not have an aerodynamic fairing for its fuselage.|$|R

5|$|A {{decision}} by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all of its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered {{the viability of the}} Australian Chinooks. This was because the Australian Army's arrangements for the logistical support of <b>its</b> <b>small</b> fleet of CH-47Ds were heavily leveraged off those for the US Army's large fleet. In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} warbler, the Nauru {{reed warbler}} has dark brown upperparts, cream underparts and a long, thin beak. It makes a low, cup-shaped nest into which it lays {{two or three}} white eggs, and it feeds on insects. However, details about its behavior and ecology are little known. It is found throughout Nauru, which has changed substantially in recent decades due to phosphate mining. The Nauru reed warbler is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, and <b>its</b> <b>small</b> range means {{that it could be}} vulnerable to chance occurrences, such as tropical cyclones. Reports of a similar warbler from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere, but was driven to local extinction by introduced cats.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed on October11 {{in the central}} Atlantic Ocean, northeast of the Lesser Antilles and southeast of Bermuda. Two days later, a ship reported strong winds and a rapid pressure drop, indicating a hurricane was in the region; the tropical cyclone was given the name Jig. It moved northwestward, steadily intensifying before turning {{to the north and}} northeast. On October15, Hurricane Jig passed about 300mi (480km) east of Bermuda, and later that day its sustained winds reach peak winds of 115mph (185km/h), although the intensity was uncertain, based on estimates from the Hurricane Hunters. The hurricane began weakening on October16. Jig became an extratropical cyclone later that day and quickly dissipated, never having affected land due to <b>its</b> <b>small</b> size.|$|E
