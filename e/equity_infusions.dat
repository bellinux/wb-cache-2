Aquino also {{found it necessary to}} write off P130 billion in bad loans granted by the government's two major financial institutions, the Philippine National Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines, [...] "to those who held positions of power and conflicting interest under Marcos." [...] The proliferation of inefficient and unprofitable public sector enterprises and bad loans held by the Philippine National Bank, the Development Bank of the Philippines, and other government entities, was a heavy legacy of the Marcos years.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe study optimal <b>equity</b> <b>infusions</b> into a {{financial}} network prone {{to the risk}} of contagious failures, which may be due to insolvency or to bank runs by short term creditors. Bank runs can be triggered by failures of connected banks. Under complete information on interbank linkages, we show that the problem reduces to a combinatorial optimization problem. Subject to budget constraints, the government chooses the set of minimal cost whose survival induces the maximum network stability. Our results demonstrate that the optimal equity infusion might significantly mitigate failure contagion risk and stabilize the system. In the case of partial information on the network, the controllers' focus swiftly changes from preventing insolvencies to preventing runs by short term creditors...|$|E
40|$|Following the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, {{regulatory authorities}} and governments provided distressed banks with <b>equity</b> <b>infusions</b> {{in order to}} strengthen national banking systems. However, {{the effectiveness of these}} interventions for financial stability has not been extensively researched in the literature. In order to understand the effectiveness of these bailouts for the solvency of banks this paper proposes a new model: the Longitudinal Binary Generalised Extreme Value (LOBGEV) model. Differing from the existing models, the LOBGEV model allows us to analyse the temporal structure of the probability of failure for banks, for both those that received a bailout and for those that did not. In particular, it encompasses both the flexibility of the D-vine copula and the accuracy of the generalised extreme value model in estimating the probability of bank failure and of banks receiving approval for capital injection. We apply this new model to the US banking system from 2008 to 2013 in order to investigate how and to what extent the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) - Capital Purchase Program (CPP) reduced the probability of the failure of commercial banks. We specifically identify a set of macroeconomic and bank-specific factors that affect the probability of bank failure for TARP-CCP recipients and for those that did not receive capital under TARP-CCP. Our results suggest that TARP-CPP provided only short-term relief for US commercial banks...|$|E

40|$|The authors assess Thailand's {{policy options}} for {{reducing}} large corporations'vulnerability to economic shocks and improving their corporate governance - and for providing smaller firms {{a more stable}} funding structure. Using data for firms listed on Thailand's stock exchange, they empirically assess {{the relative importance of}} various factors determining the cost of capital, the availability of financing, and policies and distortions that affect corporate governance in nonfinancial firms. The empirical findings highlight weaknesses in corporate governance and the inherent risks in Thailand's corporate financing structures. They conclude that the most important task in improving the structure ofcorporate financing and the framework for corporate governance is to change incentives. This will involve: 1) Accelerating legal reform, including reform of bankruptcy and foreclosure laws. 2) Improving bank monitoring of enterprise management and encouraging banks to develop more arm's-length relationships with firms. This will require greater transparency and disclosure of ownership relationships and stricter enforcement of insider and related lending limits, violation of which contributed poor intermediation and the recent crisis. 3) Improving disclosure and accounting practices. Self-regulatory agencies may need to play more of a role, possibly with more legal power to discipline violators. 4) Better enforcement of corporate governance rules. The formal structure for corporate governance is standard but enforcement is weak. 5) Facilitation of <b>equity</b> <b>infusions.</b> Investors - especially minority shareholders - may need to play a more direct role in monitoring and disciplining managers. To attract new infusions of equity, new equity owners may need more-than-proportional representation {{on the board of directors}} until other investor protection mechanisms are strengthened. 6) Improving the framework for corporate governance. A broad public discussion of corporate governance, similar to recent discussions in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, may be needed to clarify the distribution of control in the economy's real sector. 7) Strengthening institutions responsible for gathering and analyzing data on firms of all sizes and for monitoring firm performance and behavior.

40|$|The author {{explicitly}} specifies a New Keynesian style model embodying {{a financial}} constraint {{on the availability}} of equity and a financial market imperfection with regard to the existence of state-contingent assets based upon the published papers of Greenwald and Stiglitz (1988, 1990, and 1993). Using computer based numerical simulation, the author validates the three unproven Propositions found in the Greenwald and Stiglitz 1993 article with regard to the model's comparative static behaviour. Through the inclusion of a parameter for technology into the production function, the author shows that observations made by Greenwald and Stiglitz with regard to the effect of <b>equity</b> <b>infusions</b> is subject to qualification. Investigation of the model's inter-temporal behaviour reveals that the claims made by Greenwald and Stiglitz with regard to multiple periodicity are again subject to many qualifications. Linearization around the steady-state equilibrium as suggested by Greenwald and Stiglitz is shown to offer limited insight because of the implied non-linearity of the model's first order difference equation. Calibrated numerical simulation of the nonlinear difference equation reveals the potential for both single and multiple periodicity, period doubling bifurcations, and chaotic trajectories displaying sensitivity to initial conditions. In addition it was shown that the model's implied random attractor was key to understanding its inter-temporal behavior. In the Greenwald and Stiglitz articles the existence of derivative markets such as futures or options to manage risk are assumed away. The author, in order to investigate the effects of futures or options markets upon business cycles, modifies the explicitly specified model to include the use of state-contingent assets. Introducing the use of derivative financial products to manage risk, using numerical simulation, produces the surprising result that in the aggregate they may lead to slightly greater output instability. In addition to the model's structure, several intuitive reasons for these results are discussed in depth. The Greenwald and Stiglitz model also assumed that the cost of capital was not risk adjusted. The author modifies the explicitly specified model and using numerical simulation shows that like other unrealistic assumptions concerning dividend distribution, leads to alternative laws of motion. The research is concluded with discussion of possible policy and regulatory implications...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn India, micro, {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} enterprises (micro SMEs) {{play an important role in}} the country's economic development. According to RBI, the definition of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) is as follows:Enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services and whose investment in equipment (original cost excluding land and building and furniture, fittings and other items not directly related to the service rendered or as may be notified under the MSMED Act, 2006 are specified below. a) A micro enterprise is an enterprise where the investment in equipment does not exceed Rs. 10 lakh;b) A small enterprise is an enterprise where the investment in equipment is more than Rs. 10 lakh but does not exceed Rs. 2 crore; andc) A medium enterprise is an enterprise where the investment in equipment is more than Rs. 2 crore but does not exceed Rs. 5 crore. The research paper focuses on the point (a) of the above definition: The micro enterprises. Finance forms the most critical input for a business enterprise whether large or small. All firms require financing to grow and survive. Sources of finance may be external, such as loans, <b>equity</b> <b>infusions,</b> subsidies and government grants, or internal such as generated cash flows or owned funds. Many firms are self- financed in the beginning. Once the firms reach certain degree of maturity in the development of their product line and customer base, external finance becomes available. The flow of institutional finance is linked with the credit worthiness of the enterprise. Micro enterprises, due to their small size and low capital base, generally find it difficult to satisfy the conditions laid down by the banks, particularly, in establishing the viability of the project, meeting collateral requirements and making timely repayment of loans. Hence, they do not find a place among the preferred clients of the banks. In today's world, micro businesses and particularly new ones are seen more than ever as a vehicle for entrepreneurship, contributing not just to employment, social and political stability, but also to innovative and competitive power. The focus has shifted from small businesses as a social good that should be maintained at an economic cost, to small businesses as a vehicle for entrepreneurship. With this shift came the renewed perception of the important role of entrepreneurship. Indeed, recent econometric evidence suggests that entrepreneurship is a vital determinant of economic growth...|$|E

40|$|We study a {{preferred}} <b>equity</b> <b>infusion</b> government program set to mitigate inter-bank contagion. Financial institutions {{are prone to}} insolvency risk channeled through the network of interbank debt and {{to the risk of}} bank runs. The government seeks to maximize, under budget constraints, the total net worth of the financial system or, equivalently, to minimize the dead-weight losses induced by bank runs. The government is assumed to have complete information on interbank debt. The problem of quantifying the optimal amount of infusions can be expressed as a convex combinatorial optimiza-tion problem, tractable when the set of banks eligible for intervention (core banks) is sufficiently, yet realistically, small. We find that no bank has an incentive to withdraw from the program, when the preferred dividend rate paid to the government is equal to the government’s outside return on the intervention budget. On the other hand, it may be optimal for the government to make infusions in a strict subset of core banks...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} essay of this {{dissertation}} {{we examine the}} effciency of internal capital markets in banking by analyzing the allocation of equity capital within bank holding companies (BHCs). We test whether the parent channels capital to 2 ̆ 2 winners 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 losers 2 ̆ 2 by examining the characteristics of bank subsidiaries receiving <b>equity</b> capital <b>infusions</b> relative to the 2 ̆ 2 median bank 2 ̆ 2 within the BHC. Our results indicate that there are substantial inefficiencies in the internal allocation of equity capital. We do not reach unambiguous conclusions regarding the effciency of internal capital markets as there is considerable variation among the banks receiving capital infusions. ^ In the second essay we examine banks 2 ̆ 7 decision to issue new shares. Banks which do not belong in BHCs {{do not have access}} to the internal capital markets described above, and must therefore raise capital externally. Asymmetric information theory predicts that firm financial slack, the net present value of assets-in-place and investment opportunities, the share of firm value demanded by outside investors as well as market conditions influence the extent of adverse selection and thus their decision to issue new shares. Our results indicate that financial slack is the primary factor influencing bank equity issues. Furthermore, banks, like nonfinancial firms, tend to issue after stock market and interest rate increases. ^ In the third essay we examine the effectiveness of risk-based capital regulation in reducing bank credit risk. We consider changes in bank portfolio composition as proxies of bank credit risk. More specifically, we compare the portfolio choices of banks with capitalization above and below the regulatory minimum relative to those with capitalization around this minimum. Our results indicate that for medium and large banks the relationship between capitalization and subsequent credit risk is U-shaped. Thus, moral hazard prevails even after the introduction of risk-based regulation. In the case of small banks, however, our results suggest that risk-based regulation was effective in moderating the risk-taking of severely undercapitalized banks. ...|$|R
