5|$|Cochrane {{argues that}} nonhuman animals {{do not possess}} an {{intrinsic}} interest in freedom. Therefore, owning or using nonhuman animals is not, in itself, unjust. This aspect of his thought has generated responses by others, including the political theorist Robert Garner and the philosopher John Hadley, who argue {{that there may be}} reasons to claim that nonhuman animals do possess an interest in freedom. Cochrane has also proposed a cosmopolitan alternative to Sue <b>Donaldson</b> <b>and</b> Will Kymlicka's picture of a political animal rights, explicated in their 2011 book Zoopolis. Though <b>Donaldson</b> <b>and</b> Kymlicka have defended their account against Cochrane's criticism, they have said that they welcome attempts to develop alternative political theories of animal rights to their own. Cochrane's other research focusses variously on bioethics, punishment, just war and human rights.|$|E

5|$|They also {{compare the}} {{possibility}} of extending property rights to animals to the approach of European colonists, who were prepared to extend property, but not sovereignty, rights to native peoples, resulting in oppression. Hadley, however, is himself critical of <b>Donaldson</b> <b>and</b> Kymlicka's sovereignty proposal, though the British philosopher Josh Milburn suggests that the proposals {{may not be as}} far apart as the authors indicate.|$|E

5|$|Species is a 1995 American {{science fiction}} horror film {{directed}} by Roger <b>Donaldson</b> <b>and</b> written by Dennis Feldman. It stars Natasha Henstridge (in her debut film role), Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Forest Whitaker and Marg Helgenberger. In the film, a motley crew {{of scientists and}} government agents tries to track down a seductive alien played by Henstridge before she successfully mates with a human male. Due to her ruthlessness, the alien character was cited {{as an example of}} negative treatment of female sexuality and aliens by Hollywood. The design of Sil was also linked to a chupacabra sighting.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{identified}} the contributions from Driessen, Flanders and Boyer as of particular interest, though challenged {{the inclusion of}} chapters focussed on the environment. They also criticised the book's failure to include contributions from, or sufficiently engage with the work of, the key voices in the politically focused animal ethics literature, such as Robert Garner, Sue <b>Donaldson</b> <b>and</b> Will Kymlicka, Alasdair Cochrane, Kimberly Smith or Siobhan O'Sullivan. Wissenburg's chapter was identified as the one which engaged most directly with this literature; his approach, however, was a negative one. Garner has written that Political Animals and Animal Politics should be praised for its trailblazing, but predicted {{that it would be}} superseded by stronger collections on the same theme.|$|E
