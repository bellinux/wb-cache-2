25|$|Subtleties in, and an {{imperfect}} scholarly understanding of, high Nahuatl rhetorical style make the exact intent of these comments tricky to ascertain, but Restall argues that Moctezuma's politely offering his throne to Cortés (if indeed he did <b>ever</b> <b>give</b> the speech as reported) {{may well have}} been meant as the exact opposite of what it was taken to mean: politeness in Aztec culture was a way to assert dominance and show superiority. This speech, which has been widely referred to, has been a factor in the widespread belief that Moctezuma was addressing Cortés as the returning god Quetzalcoatl.|$|E
25|$|When Zarinsky {{was indicted}} in 2000 for the murder, Bette Bernoskie, {{the widow of}} Officer Charles Bernoskie, filed a wrongful-death suit against Zarinsky in civil court. In August 2003, a jury found Zarinsky {{responsible}} for the death and awarded Bette Bernoskie $9,500,000 plus interest. In 2004, $154,000 was seized from Zarinsky's assets, and Bette Bernoskie divided this award among her legal representatives and her six children. In July 2007, a New Jersey Appellate Court reversed the decision and ordered the money returned to Zarinsky, citing his inability to put on a proper defense. Bette Bernoskie no longer had the money, and the New Jersey Patrolmen's Benevolent Association then organized efforts to repay it. It was their intention that neither Bette Bernoskie nor her children would <b>ever</b> <b>give</b> back the award money.|$|E
25|$|Seiya is the eponymous main {{character}} of the Saint Seiya series. He {{is one of the}} eighty-eight Saints of Athena and serves loyally at her side. Seiya draws his superhuman powers from Cosmo, the energy of the Big Bang that lingers inside each being and which connects a Saint to his constellation and Cloth. At the start of the series, Seiya is thirteen years old. His main objective is to find his older sister Seika, who disappeared when he was sent to Greece to train to become a Saint {{under the supervision of the}} Silver Saint Eagle Marin. Due to her physical similarities to Seika, Seiya suspects that Marin may be his sister, but he later discovers he is wrong and finds his real sister. As Seiya starts fighting alongside the other Bronze Saints, albeit reluctantly at first, his motivations shift to the protection of Athena. Seiya is a person of burning passion and spirit, sometimes acting in brash and impulsive ways. Despite this, he's still a brave, kind-hearted and selfless young man; and is always willing to sacrifice himself for justice, his friends and Athena. His most notable characteristic is his absolute determination and refusal to <b>ever</b> <b>give</b> up, even when faced with impossible odds. He also has a habit of making jokes and can be unconcerned about the consequences of his actions.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Miller then posed three {{questions}} for the Court to answer: :"1. Did the State of Virginia <b>ever</b> <b>give</b> a consent to this proposition which became obligatory on her? [...] 2. Did the Congress give such consent as rendered the agreement valid? [...] 3. If both these are answered affirmatively, {{it may be necessary}} to inquire whether the circumstances alleged in this bill, authorized Virginia to withdraw her consent, and justify us in setting aside the contract, and restoring the two counties to that State." [...] Justice Miller then reviewed the various acts taken to reorganize the government of Virginia in 1861, and the various acts which the Reorganized Government and the United States took to create the state of West Virginia and extend its jurisdiction over the counties in question. In answering the first question, Miller wrote, [...] "Now, we have here, on two different occasions, the emphatic legislative proposition of Virginia that these counties might become part of West Virginia; and we have the constitution of West Virginia agreeing to accept them and providing for their place in the new-born State." [...] There was no question, in the mind of the majority, that Virginia had given its consent. Although the elections had been postponed due to a [...] "hostile" [...] environment, the majority concluded that the Reorganized Government of Virginia had acted in [...] "good faith" [...] to carry out its electoral duties in the two counties.|$|E
2500|$|The Liberals {{lost the}} federal {{election}} of May 1979 to a minority Conservative government led by Joe Clark. When Pierre Trudeau regained power in February 1980, he appointed Chrétien Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. In this role, he was {{a major force in}} the 1980 Quebec referendum, being one of the main federal representatives [...] "on the ground" [...] during the campaign. His fiery and emotional speeches would enthrall federalist crowds with his blunt warnings of the consequences of separation. During the 1980 referendum, Chrétien fiercely fought behind the scenes with the leader of the Quebec Liberals, Claude Ryan, who served as the chairman of the non committee about the best course to follow, with Ryan favoring a more Quebec nationalist message as opposed to Chrétien's unabashed Canadian nationalist message. In his speeches, Chrétien boosted the first white men to see the Prairies and the Rocky mountains had been the French-Canadian voyaguers and Coureur des bois in the 17th and 18th centuries, saying the Rockies and the Great Plains were part of French Canada's heritage, and asked how could the Québécois <b>ever</b> <b>give</b> up their heritage. Chrétien praised the great French fur traders like Pierre-Esprit Radisson, Médard des Groseilliers, and La Vérendrye who ventured west, saying what they had found belonged to all of French Canada, and often ended his speeches with the remark [...] "I want them [...] for my children and grandchildren!", which frequently brought his audiences to tears. Chrétien delivered an average of 6 or 7 speeches a day during the 1980 referendum all across Quebec and always managed to work in a local reference in every speech.|$|E

2500|$|The {{work was}} set aside until 1815 when Coleridge {{compiled}} manuscripts of his poems for a collection titled Sibylline Leaves. The poem remained buried in obscurity until a 10 April 1816 meeting between Coleridge and Lord Byron, who persuaded Coleridge to publish Christabel and [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] as fragments. Leigh Hunt, the poet and essayist, witnessed {{the event and}} wrote, [...] "He recited his 'Kubla Khan' one morning to Lord Byron, in his Lordship's house in Piccadilly, when I {{happened to be in}} another room. I remember the other's coming away from him, highly struck with his poem, and saying how wonderfully he talked. This was the impression of everyone who heard him." [...] Byron arranged for John Murray to publish the poem with Christabel and [...] "The Pains of Sleep" [...] along with prefaces to the works. A contract was drawn up on 12 April 1816 for 80 pounds. Charles Lamb, poet and friend of Coleridge, witnessed Coleridge's work towards publishing the poem and wrote to Wordsworth: [...] "Coleridge is printing Xtabel by Lord Byron's recommendation to Murray, with what he calls a vision of Kubla Khan – which said vision he repeats so enchantingly that it irradiates & brings Heaven & Elysian bowers into my parlour while he sings or says it". Coleridge stayed in London to work on the poem and also to try and break his opium addiction. However, not everyone was happy with the idea of the poem's being published, as Coleridge's wife, who was not with him, wrote to Thomas Poole, [...] "Oh! when will he <b>ever</b> <b>give</b> his friends anything but pain? he has been so unwise as to publish his fragments of 'Christabel' & 'Kubla-Khan' ... we were all sadly vexed when we read the advertisement of these things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in December, {{there was}} {{controversy}} regarding Obama's admissions {{of drug use}} as a teen. Obama first publicly acknowledged the issue in his 1995 book, Dreams from My Father. In the book, Obama said [...] "Pot had helped, and booze. Maybe a little blow when you could afford it." [...] The issue was revived {{on the campaign trail}} after a November 2007 speech at a New Hampshire high school. Obama told the students, [...] "I've made some bad decisions that I've actually written about," [...] noting that his [...] "drinking and experimenting with drugs" [...] accounted for a lot of [...] "wasted time" [...] in high school. Some, including Republican candidate Mitt Romney, criticized Obama for discussing these examples with students. Romney said that [...] "in order to leave the best possible example for our kids, we're probably wisest not to talk about our own indiscretions in great detail." [...] However, fellow GOP candidate Rudy Giuliani and Partnership for a Drug-Free America president Stephen J. Pasierb praised Obama's candor. [...] "I respect his honesty," [...] Giuliani said. Pasierb told CNN that [...] "really the truth works best" [...] when discussing drug use with kids. Bill Shaheen, the co-chairman of Clinton's campaign in New Hampshire, mentioned the drug use in a December 12 conference call with reporters. Shaheen said that if Obama were to win the nomination, Republicans would use Obama's admissions against him in a general election. He suggested that in such a scenario, Republicans would ask, [...] "'When was the last time? Did you <b>ever</b> <b>give</b> drugs to anyone? Did you sell them to anyone?'" [...] He added that such [...] "Republican dirty tricks" [...] would be difficult to overcome. The comments immediately caused controversy, and Shaheen resigned the next day. Clinton denounced the comments and personally apologized to Obama. Her spokesman said that she [...] "made it clear that this kind of negative personal statement has no part in this campaign." [...] Appearing on Hardball with Chris Matthews, Axelrod accused the Clinton campaign of giving a [...] "wink and a nod" [...] to negative tactics. He criticized Clinton's December 3 statement in which she signaled a more aggressive approach and called it the [...] "fun part" [...] of the campaign. Axelrod said that the signal should come [...] "from the top" [...] that the campaigns will not be waged [...] "in the gutter." ...|$|E
