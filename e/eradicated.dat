5|$|Tuatara {{were removed}} from Stanley, Red Mercury and Cuvier Islands in 1990 and 1991, and {{maintained}} in captivity to allow Polynesian rats to be <b>eradicated</b> on those islands. All three populations bred in captivity, and after successful eradication of the rats, all individuals, including the new juveniles, were returned to their islands of origin. In the 1991–92 season, Little Barrier Island was found to hold only eight tuatara, which were taken into in situ captivity, where females produced 42eggs, which were incubated at Victoria University. The resulting offspring were subsequently held in an enclosure on the island, then released into the wild in 2006 after rats were <b>eradicated</b> there.|$|E
50|$|In February 1950, the Communists {{made it a}} top {{priority}} to <b>eradicate</b> the bandits. The Communists decided to first <b>eradicate</b> bandits in wealthy areas and regions adjacent to the communication/transportation lines, gradually expanding their efforts into more remote regions. The Communist III Corps, IV Corps, V Corps, XVIII Corps and the 7th Army of the I Corps, totaling to seventeen armies, were deployed for the bandit suppression campaign. From March 1953 onward, the Communists first targeted large bands of bandits with each military formation responsible of pacification of its designated area. Due to the heavy bandit activity in Sichuan, the planned deployment of Communist troops in Tibet was postponed to <b>eradicate</b> bandits first. The 11th Army and the 12th Army, totaling six divisions of the Communist III Corps, were responsible for <b>eradicating</b> bandits in eastern Sichuan. Eight divisions from the 10th Army, 18th Army and 15th Army of the Communist southern Sichuan Military Region were tasked to <b>eradicating</b> bandits in southern Sichuan. Seven divisions of the 60th Army, 62nd Army, and 7th Army of the Western Sichuan Military Region were tasked to <b>eradicate</b> bandits in western Sichuan. The 61st Army was tasked to <b>eradicate</b> bandits in northern Sichuan, and the 62nd Army was tasked to <b>eradicate</b> bandits in Xikang. The 13th Army, 14th Army and units of the 15th Army of the Communist IV Corps were tasked to <b>eradicate</b> bandits in Yunnan. The 16th Army of III Corps was tasked to <b>eradicate</b> bandits in Guizhou. After ten months of fighting, large organized bands of bandits were wiped out {{by the end of}} 1950, with over nine hundred thousand bandits annihilated.|$|R

5|$|In the Hen and Chicken Islands, Pacific rats were <b>eradicated</b> on Whatupuke in 1993, Lady Alice Island in 1994, and Coppermine Island in 1997. Following this program, {{juvenile}}s {{have once}} again been {{seen on the}} latter three islands. In contrast, rats persist on Hen Island of the same group, and no juvenile tuatara had been seen there as of 2001. In the Alderman Islands, Middle Chain Island holds no tuatara, but it is considered possible for rats to swim between Middle Chain and other islands that do hold tuatara, and the rats were <b>eradicated</b> in 1992 to prevent this. Another rodent eradication was carried out on the Rangitoto Islands east of D'Urville Island, {{to prepare for the}} release of 432 Cook Strait tuatara juveniles in 2004, which were being raised at Victoria University as of 2001.|$|E

5|$|The {{much smaller}} {{population}} of Atlantic walruses ranges from the Canadian Arctic, across Greenland, Svalbard, {{and the western}} part of Arctic Russia. There are eight hypothetical subpopulations of walruses, based largely on their geographical distribution and movements: five west of Greenland and three east of Greenland. The Atlantic walrus once ranged south to Sable Island, Nova Scotia, and as late as the eighteenth century was found in large numbers in the greater Gulf of St. Lawrence region, sometimes in colonies of up to 7,000 to 8,000 individuals. This population was nearly <b>eradicated</b> by commercial harvest; their current numbers, though difficult to estimate, probably remain below 20,000. In April 2006, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the population of the northwest Atlantic walrus in Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador as having been <b>eradicated</b> in Canada.|$|E

We do this via studies with a validated mathematical model, where the parameter values are ob-tained with newly acquired clinical data for HIV patients. Our findings indicate that the strategy of reactivating the reservoir combined with enhancement of the killing rate of HIV-specific CD 8 + T cells {{is able to}} <b>eradicate</b> the reservoir. In addition, our analysis shows that a targeted suppression of the the immune system is also a possible strategy to <b>eradicate</b> the reservoir.
