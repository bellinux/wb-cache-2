5|$|After Joseph Stalin's death, {{the process}} of destalinization {{prompted}} debates about fundamental issues throughout the entire Eastern Bloc. Nikita Khrushchev's speech On the Personality Cult and its Consequences had wide implications outside the Soviet Union and in other communist countries. In Poland, {{in addition to the}} criticism of the cult of personality, popular topics of debate centered on the right to steer a more independent course of 'local, national socialism' instead of following the Soviet model down to every little detail; such views were seen in <b>discussion</b> <b>and</b> critique by many Polish United Workers' Party members of Stalin's execution of older Polish communists from Communist Party of Poland during the Great Purge.|$|E

The couple became a popular publicity and performing team who toured widely in stage shows, where Mansfield's leopard-spot bikini became a topic of <b>discussion</b> <b>and</b> newspaper coverage. As a highlight, Hargitay tossed her around his waist and spun her in wide circles as her shows made more headlines. On screen, he was Mansfield's male lead in her Italian ventures—The Loves of Hercules and L'Amore Primitivo, and a major supporting character in Promises! Promises!. On stage, he was the male lead in The Tropicana Holiday, The House of Love, French Dressing, and other nightclub acts.|$|E
5|$|His third studio album, titled Mockingbird (2005), was {{released}} on December 26, 2005. The album touches on subjects such as politics, social justice, and war. Webb has stated that he tackled these subjects to stimulate <b>discussion</b> <b>and</b> engage people to bring about changes in {{what he sees as}} some of the greatest problems the world is facing today. In order to broaden this discussion to people less inclined to purchase his album, beginning September 1, 2006, Webb offered Mockingbird for free on the website Free Derek Webb (no longer exists), where it was available for download until December 8, 2006. Over 80,000 free copies of the album were downloaded during this time.|$|E

She found the book after entering a <b>discussion</b> <b>and</b> research group on mental health in Brazil. Impressed by its narrative, she asked Luiz Bolognesi to adapt it, as she knew he had a similar worldview and would have the respect necessary to work on the subject. Bolognesi was reluctant as he considered it a complicated subject; he was close to giving up until he read and was touched by Paulo Leminski's presentation of the book.|$|E

Leaving of the chamber would have signified an end to the <b>discussion,</b> <b>and</b> the acceptance of the motion, meaning the acceptance of foreign territorial demands.|$|E

5|$|The {{safety of}} high energy {{particle}} collisions was {{a topic of}} widespread <b>discussion</b> <b>and</b> topical interest during {{the time when the}} Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and later the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)—currently the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator—were being constructed and commissioned. Concerns arose that such high energy experiments—designed to produce novel particles and forms of matter—had the potential to create harmful states of matter or even doomsday scenarios. Claims escalated as commissioning of the LHC drew closer, around 2008–2010. The claimed dangers included the production of stable micro black holes and the creation of hypothetical particles called strangelets, and these questions were explored in the media, on the Internet and at times through the courts.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{classical}} figures (Comte, Durkheim) Weber did not attempt, consciously, to create any {{specific set of}} rules governing social sciences in general, or sociology in particular. In comparison with Durkheim and Marx, Weber was more focused on individuals and culture and this is clear in his methodology. Whereas Durkheim focused on the society, Weber concentrated on the individuals and their actions (see structure and action <b>discussion)</b> <b>and</b> whereas Marx argued for {{the primacy of the}} material world over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as motivating actions of individuals, at least in the big picture.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{adaptation}} {{failed to}} have the same cultural impact as the 1995 serial and has since attracted sharply-divided opinions. However, even three years after the release, Knightley was still associated with Elizabeth Bennet among a generation of young viewers who had not seen the 1995 production. Given the varied opinions about the film, JASNA published an edited special issue of its online journal Persuasions On-Line in 2007 with the collaboration of nineteen Austen scholars from six countries; the intent was to foster <b>discussion</b> <b>and</b> stimulate scholarly analysis. JASNA had done this only once before, for the 1996 film Emma.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{political}} satire, the film received {{a positive response}} from the government of Singapore. Goh Chok Tong, then Prime Minister of Singapore, commended Jack Neo's creative talent during his National Day Rally address on 18 August 2002. In 2004, Neo was the first local film-maker to receive a National Day Award, and on 21 October 2005, he and Dick Lee became the first pop culture artists to receive the Cultural Medallion, Singapore's highest arts award. The movie sparked public <b>discussion</b> <b>and</b> parliamentary debate about {{the negative effects of}} streaming. In 2004, the Ministry of Education decided to merge the EM1 and EM2 streams, and on 29 September 2006, it announced that the EM3 stream will be scrapped by 2008.|$|E
