500|$|To <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>every</b> able-bodied Athenian male {{would be}} {{required}} to man the ships. This in turn meant that the Athenians must prepare to abandon Athens. Persuading the Athenians to take this course was undoubtedly {{one of the highlights of}} Themistocles's career. As Holland has it: [...] "What precise heights of oratory he attained, what stirring and memorable phrases he pronounced, we have no way of knowing...only by the effect it had on the assembly can we gauge what surely must have been its electric and vivifying quality—for Themistocles' audacious proposals, when put to the vote, were ratified. The Athenian people, facing the gravest moment of peril in their history, committed themselves once and for all to the alien element of the sea, and put their faith in a man whose ambitions many had long profoundly dreaded." [...] His proposals accepted, Themistocles issued orders for the women and children of Athens to be sent to the city of Troezen, safely inside the Peloponnesus. He was then able to travel to a meeting of the Allies, at which he proposed his strategy; with the Athenian fleet fully committed to the defence of Greece, the other Allies accepted his proposals.|$|E

Many of the clergymen likewise were dead, and others gone into the country; for it really required a steady courage and a strong faith for a man not only to venture being in town at such a time as this, but likewise to venture to come to church and perform the office of a minister to a congregation, of whom he had reason to believe many of them were actually infected with the plague, and to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>every</b> day, or twice a day, as in some places was done.|$|E

30|$|At times, Prokofiev used {{unrelated}} tones {{merely to}} add color {{and not for}} the purpose of modulation. He also used these altered tones to strengthen otherwise bland melodies. In melodies, this type of usage enhances the restatement of a theme. For instance, the first statement may be straightforward, then the second statement is given greater emphasis or excitement by adding accidentals. In <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> <b>every</b> melodic note is a tonal center and tones grouped nearby are related (Nest’ev, 1960 l, p. 479). This usage leads us away from harmonic devices into the realm of melody.|$|R
