50|$|The PWBs are {{designed}} to have fiducial marks on them as reference points. Vision systems in the stencil printing machines use these fiducial marks for aligning the PWB. Without these fiducials the printer would not print the solder paste in exact alignment with the pads. There {{are two types of}} fiducials used namely global and local fiducials. Global fiducials align the printer to the PWB. Local fiducials are required for precise placement of <b>fine</b> <b>pitched</b> components, in the component placement stage. Local fiducial cannot be used in the printing process The entering PWB should have close dimensional tolerances so that it mates to the stencil. This is necessary to achieve the required alignment of solder blocks on the pads.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. CoPt {{magnetic}} dot arrays with a {{fine pitch}} of 30 nm have been fabricated using electron beam (EB) lithography and ion milling. The possibility to ion-mill CoPt film using EB drawn calixarene resist pattern as a mask has been studied. We formed 30 nm pitch resist dot arrays with a dot diameter of 20 nm using 30 -keV-EB lithography with calixarene resist. The resist dot arrays were ion-milled for 4 min using 200 -eV Ar ion milling to fabricate CoPt dot arrays on a Si substrate. We fabricated <b>fine</b> <b>pitched</b> CoPt magnetic dot arrays with a diameter of 22 - 35 nm and a pitch of 30 - 150 nm. Results show that the ion-milled CoPt dot diameter increased with the dot pitch while the resist dot had a similar diameter of 20 nm...|$|E

40|$|Anisotropic {{conductive}} adhesives {{have emerged}} as an important joining technology {{in a number of}} significant application areas, such as <b>fine</b> <b>pitched</b> driver IC for flat panel display assembly and smart cards. In the past research work in this field, {{it has been shown that}} the pressure distribution and adhesive compression flow predicted using the Newtonian and non-Newtonian FV models both agree closely with those from the previously developed analytical model. This gives confidence in the FV modelling approach and therefore the results predicted more complex situations which the analytical model cannot address. These results further confirm that a more sophisticated modelling approach is required in order to allow a full understanding about the effects of the assembly process on its final properties when the adhesive flows. An analytical model has been proposed in this paper which takes into account more complex bump geometry and can be used to predict the velocity and pressure drop distribution through the entire chip during the COG bonding process. The analytical solution is followed by the finite element modelling, which agrees well with the analytically predicted solution...|$|E
40|$|Pulsed laser {{ablation}} {{has been investigated}} as a method {{for the creation of}} thick segmented scintillator arrays for high-energy X-ray radiography. Thick scintillators are needed to improve the X-ray absorption at high energies, while segmentation is required for spatial resolution. Monte-Carlo simulations predicted that reflections at the inter-segment walls were the greatest source of loss of scintillation photons. As a result of this, <b>fine</b> <b>pitched</b> arrays would be inefficient as the number of reflections would be significantly higher than in large pitch arrays. Nanosecond and femtosecond pulsed {{laser ablation}} was investigated as a method to segment cadmium tungstate (CdWO_ 4). The effect of laser parameters on the ablation mechanisms, laser induced material changes and debris produced were investigated using optical and electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for both types of lasers. It was determined that nanosecond ablation was unsuitable due to the large amount of cracking and a heat affected zone created during the ablation process. Femtosecond pulsed laser ablation was found to induce less damage. The optimised laser parameters for a 1028 nm laser was found to be a pulse energy of 54 μJ corresponding to a fluence of 5. 3 J cm^- 2 a pulse duration of 190 fs, a repetition rate of 78. 3 kHz and a laser scan speed of 707 mm s^- 1 achieving a normalised pulse overlap of 0. 8. A serpentine scan pattern was found to minimise damage caused by anisotropic thermal expansion. Femtosecond pulsed ablation was also found to create a layer of tungsten and cadmium sub-oxides {{on the surface of the}} crystals. The CdWO_ 4 could be cleaned by immersing the CdWO_ 4 in ammonium hydroxide at 45 °C for 15 minutes. However, XPS indicated that the ammonium hydroxide formed a thin layer of CdCO_ 3 and Cd(OH) _ 2 on the surface. Prototype arrays were shown to be able to resolve features as small as 0. 5 mm using keV energy X-rays. The most efficient prototype showed low detective quantum efficiency of 0. 08 ± 0. 01 at 0 lp/mm using a tube voltage of 160 kVp...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A 10 Gb/s {{limiting}} amplifier IC with the emitter area of 1. 5 x 10 µm 2 for optical transmission system {{was designed and}} fabricated with a AlGaAs/ GaAs HBTs technology. In this study, we evaluated <b>fine</b> <b>pitch</b> bump using WL-CSP (Wafer Level-Chip Scale Packaging) instead of conventional wire bonding for interconnection. For this we developed WL-CSP process and formed <b>fine</b> <b>pitch</b> solder bump with the 40 µm diameter and 100 µm pitch on bonding pad. To study the effect of WL-CSP, electrical performance was measured and analyzed in wafer and package module using WL-CSP. In a package module, clear and wide eye diagram openings were observed and the rise/fall times were about 100 ps, and the output voltage swing was limited to 600 mVp-p with input voltage ranging from 50 to 500 mV. The Small signal gains in wafer and package module were 15. 56 dB and 14. 99 dB respectively. It {{was found that the}} difference of small signal gain in wafer and package module was less then 0. 57 dB up to 10 GHz and the characteristics of return loss was improved by 5 dB in package module. This is due to the short interconnection length by WL-CSP. So, WL-CSP process can be used for millimeter wave GaAs MMIC with the <b>fine</b> <b>pitch</b> pad. I...|$|R
