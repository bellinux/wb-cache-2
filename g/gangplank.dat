5|$|In Ardis, Maryland, a {{high-speed}} police chase unfolds at a waterfront. The {{driver of the}} car, Dr. William Secare, is cornered by officers but fights them off with surprising ease. Secare is shot as he runs up a <b>gangplank</b> and leaps off a ship into the water. The police fail to locate him but discover that his blood is green.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the ship, {{passenger}} John Geiger hacks {{into the}} ship's computer system, {{and the following}} evening, he destroys the ship's communication systems and kills the captain. After remotely shutting down the ship's engines, Geiger calls the bridge to tell the first officer, Juliano, that the captain is dead and he is in charge. Juliano is ordered by Geiger to evacuate the ship. Geiger steals jewelry from the ship's vault. As passengers evacuate, Drew, a young deaf girl, becomes trapped in an elevator, {{and a group of}} people become trapped behind locked fire doors in a hallway filling with smoke. As Annie and Alex attempt to board the last lifeboat, Geiger programs the ship to continue sailing. The winch lowering the lifeboat jams. Alex jumps into the boat to rescue the passengers who are falling off, and Annie and Juliano use the ship's <b>gangplank</b> to get them back on deck.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, June 26, 1903, {{the cook}} of the Bailey Gatzert, a Chinese-American, was {{reported}} to have slipped from the <b>gangplank</b> of the steamer while docked at Portland, fell into the river, and drowned, within sight of 50 persons.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{boats were}} drawn by mules. Mules lasted about 15 years. Mules were often changed at locks, over <b>gangplanks.</b> Some boatmen would change teams {{by making the}} mules swim to the shore to change teams, leading to mules {{drowning}} as a result. Mules were bought, at 2½ years, often from Kentucky, and were broken in by having them drag logs. The command to stop mules was not [...] "whoa" [...] but [...] "ye–yip–ye" ...|$|R
25|$|Typically {{constructed}} of hardwood planking and selectively clad with armour plate, this shallow-draft, barge-like boat {{with a crew}} of four could ferry an infantry platoon of 31, with space to spare for five additional specialist troops, to shore at 7 knots (13km/h). Men generally entered the boat by walking over a <b>gangplank</b> from the boat deck of a troop transport as the LCA hung from its davits. When loaded, the LCA was lowered into the water. Soldiers exited by the boat's bow ramp.|$|E
25|$|Savannahs owners {{made every}} effort to secure {{passengers}} and freight for the voyage, but no-one was willing to risk lives or property aboard such a novel vessel. On May 19, a late advertisement appeared in the local paper announcing the date of departure as May 20. In the event, Savannahs departure was delayed for two days after one of her crew returned to the vessel in a highly inebriated state, fell off the <b>gangplank</b> and drowned. In spite of this delay however, still no passengers came forward, and the ship would make her historic voyage purely in an experimental capacity.|$|E
25|$|The first panel {{shows the}} antisemitic and xenophobic {{obstacles}} American immigrants faced. During the global Depression, {{citizens of the}} United States struggled for their livelihoods. Because foreigners represented competition for employment, they were especially unwelcome. National immigration quotas also reflected the strained foreign relations of the United States {{at a time when}} fascism, Nazism, and communism were on the rise. To illustrate the political and social adversary, Shahn incorporated loaded iconography: Nazi soldiers, anti-Jewish signs and the executed Italian anarchists, Sacco and Vanzetti. Below, Shahn's mother and Albert Einstein lead immigrants on a <b>gangplank</b> situated by the Ellis Island registry center and the Statue of Liberty. This section demonstrates the immigrants' heroic emergence in the United States.|$|E
50|$|By this time, {{the entire}} ship was {{consumed}} in flames. Only 15 crew members {{had been on}} the ship when the fire broke out, and they failed to make a sweep of the upper four decks to wake passengers; those who did wake up were awakened by screaming and running in the corridors. Most of the ship’s stairwells were on fire, and few passengers were able to reach E-deck to escape down the <b>gangplanks.</b> Some passengers climbed down ropes to the pier.|$|R
50|$|At this point—twenty {{years old}} and {{approaching}} graduation— an opportunity was presented to him, that would be his life’s journey, and it would begin with a required sojourn in Florence, Dante’s home. But there was a parental figure who was determined {{to prevent him from}} taking this first step. The story of his escape from home, up until the <b>gangplanks</b> are drawn up and the ship sets sail, as he relates it in the essay, “Endings and Beginnings”, is a tale of suspense.|$|R
50|$|The most {{versatile}} {{member of the}} Coast Guard's operational team is the boatswain's mate (BM). Boatswain's mates are masters of seamanship. BMs are capable of performing almost any task in connection with deck maintenance, small boat operations, navigation, and supervising all personnel assigned to a ship's deck force. BMs have a general knowledge of ropes and cables, including different uses, stresses, strains, and proper stowing. BMs operate hoists, cranes, and winches to load cargo or set <b>gangplanks,</b> and stand watch for security, navigation or communications.|$|R
25|$|The Flyer's <b>gangplank</b> was {{extended}} out {{to one of}} these freight loading slips. As the passengers were boarding, the slip locking mechanism gave way, the ramp collapsed into the water, and 50 people were tumbled into the sound. The captain of the Flyer saw the accident and immediately blew the emergency whistle. The fireboat Snoqualmie, which had {{come to the aid of}} the Flyer twenty years before, now again went to her assistance, as did the launch Skeeter, skipper Roy Lillico, and boat of the Rosalie, in charge of mate Louis Van Bogaert. The captain ordered the crew to toss life preservers and anything else floatable to the people struggling in the water. Within ten minutes, all but two people, Mrs. G.V. Leonard and a one–year–old baby, Carl Bruder, had been rescued. Their tragic drownings broke the Flyer's long record of passenger safety.|$|E
500|$|More than 20 years pass, {{and it is}} 1927. An aged Joe on the Cotton Blossom sings a reprise of [...] "Ol' Man River". Cap'n Andy has {{a chance}} meeting with Ravenal and {{arranges}} his reunion with Magnolia. Andy knows that Magnolia is retiring and returning to the Cotton Blossom with Kim, who has become a Broadway star. Kim gives her admirers a taste of her performing abilities by singing an updated, Charleston version of [...] "Why Do I Love You?" [...] Ravenal sings a reprise of [...] "You Are Love" [...] to the offstage Magnolia. Although he is uncertain about asking her to take him back, Magnolia, who has never stopped loving him, greets him warmly and does. As the happy couple walks up the boat's <b>gangplank,</b> Joe and the cast sing the last verse of [...] "Ol' Man River".|$|E
500|$|In America, the {{political}} atmosphere {{began to change}} and attention was once again directed to Chaplin's films instead of his views. In July 1962, The New York Times published an editorial stating that [...] "we {{do not believe the}} Republic would be in danger if yesterday's unforgotten little tramp were allowed to amble down the <b>gangplank</b> of a steamer or plane in an American port". The same month, Chaplin was invested with the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the universities of Oxford and Durham. In November 1963, the Plaza Theater in New York started a year-long series of Chaplin's films, including Monsieur Verdoux and Limelight, which gained excellent reviews from American critics. September 1964 saw the release of Chaplin's memoirs, My Autobiography, which he had been working on since 1957. The 500-page book, which focused on his early years and personal life, became a worldwide best-seller, despite criticism over the lack of information on his film career.|$|E
50|$|On 7 June, Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren and {{the record}} label Virgin {{arranged}} to charter a private boat and have the Sex Pistols perform while sailing down the River Thames, passing Westminster Pier and the Houses of Parliament. The event, {{a mockery of the}} Queen's river procession planned for two days later, ended in chaos. Police launches forced the boat to dock, and constabulary surrounded the <b>gangplanks</b> at the pier. While the band members and their equipment were hustled down a side stairwell, McLaren, Vivienne Westwood, and many of the band's entourage were arrested.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gangplanks</b> were lowered and William Foy and Capt. Frederick H. Heinde, {{commander}} of the Pinkerton landing operation, tensely faced off amidst mutual threats. A fracas erupted, with clubs wielded and shots were fired, with both Foy and Heinde hit by bullets. The Pinkertons began firing their rifles repeatedly into the crowd, with armed strikers answering in kind, {{and for the next}} ten minutes a pitched gun battle was waged; several strikers and two Pinkertons were mortally wounded, with dozens of others injured, including Hugh O'Donnell, who was grazed by a bullet to his thumb.|$|R
5000|$|The RCT docked at Naples on 31 May, {{the troopers}} filed down <b>gangplanks</b> into waiting {{railroad}} cars and were carried to a staging {{area in the}} Neapolitan suburb of Bagnoli. En route, Colonel Graves was handed an order directing the RCT {{to take part in}} the attack from Valmontone to Rome the next day. The 517th was ready to go, but since crew-served weapons, artillery and vehicles had been loaded separately it would have to be with only rifles. After this was pointed out, the order was cancelled and the RCT moved on to set up camp in [...] "The Crater", the bed of a long-extinct volcano.|$|R
500|$|In December 1900, Trenchard {{returned}} to England, arriving by hospital ship at Southampton. [...] He hobbled {{with the aid}} of sticks down the <b>gangplank</b> where his concerned parents met him. [...] As a disabled soldier without independent financial means, Trenchard was now at his lowest point. [...] He spent the next fortnight at the Mayfair nursing home for disabled officers which was run by the Red Cross. [...] Trenchard's case {{came to the attention of}} Lady Dudley, by whose philanthropic efforts the Mayfair nursing home operated. [...] Through her generosity she arranged for Trenchard to see a specialist who told Trenchard that he needed to spend several months in Switzerland where the air was likely to be of benefit to his lung. [...] Trenchard and his family could not afford the expense and Trenchard was too embarrassed to explain the situation. [...] However, without asking any questions, Lady Dudley presented Trenchard with a cheque to cover the costs.|$|E
500|$|Donkey Kong, after {{investigating}} his [...] "Kong's Banana Hoard", {{located just}} below his home, and discovering that his banana hoard has disappeared, [...] embarks {{on a journey}} to recover it from King K. Rool and the Kremlings. While collecting bananas on the island's vastly different regions, Donkey Kong defeats various enemies, including the reptilian Kremlings, and other hazardous creatures native to the island. Aiding him in his quest {{are some of the}} other Kongs: Diddy accompanies Donkey Kong on his quest, Cranky provides hints and comic relief, Candy operates the island's save points, and Funky offers a means of transportation around the island. Also assisting Donkey Kong at times are various 'animal buddies' (Rambi the Rhino, Expresso the Ostrich, Enguarde the Swordfish, Winky the Frog, and Squawks the Parrot), each with their own unique abilities. After progressing through the island's different areas, Donkey Kong ultimately arrives on a pirate ship called <b>Gangplank</b> Galleon, where Donkey Kong's nemesis and the leader of the Kremlings, King K. Rool, awaits with Donkey Kong's banana hoard. Upon his defeat, the game ends with a final shot of Donkey Kong's banana hoard restored to its former glory, filled with bananas once again.|$|E

25|$|After her construction, Eastland was {{discovered}} to have design flaws, making her susceptible to listing. The ship was top-heavy, which became evident when passengers congregated en masse {{on the upper}} decks. During July 1903, a case of overcrowding caused Eastland to list with water flowing {{up one of the}} ship's <b>gangplanks.</b> The situation was quickly rectified, {{but this was the first}} of several incidents. Later in the same month, the stern of the ship was damaged when she was backed into the tugboat George W. Gardner. During August 1906, another incident of listing occurred which resulted in the filing of complaints against the Chicago-South Haven Line which had purchased the ship earlier that year.|$|R
5|$|The Virgin release {{had been}} timed to {{coincide}} with the height of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee celebrations. By Jubilee weekend, {{a week and a half}} after the record's release, it had sold more than 150,000 copies—a massive success. On 7 June, McLaren and the record label arranged to charter a private boat and have the Sex Pistols perform while sailing down the River Thames, passing Westminster Pier and the Houses of Parliament. The event, a mockery of the Queen's river procession planned for two days later, ended in chaos.

50|$|In 1917, Colman Dock {{was owned}} and {{operated}} by Colman Dock Company, with B. P. Morgan as manager. Colman Dock was the terminal of the Puget Sound Navigation Company, the Merchants Transportation Company, and several Puget Sound shipping lines. Colman Dock measured 700 by ll5 feet, with 1,400 feet of berthing space. In 1917 an overhead walk (still in existence in 1983) led from the Seattle business district to the waiting room, from which most of the Puget Sound steamship passenger traffic originated. There were also adjustable passenger <b>gangplanks</b> and adjustable freight slips. In 1917 Colman Dock was equipped with a Barlow marine elevator. Colman Dock could accommodate 14 Puget Sound steamboats at one time. There were offices {{on the north side of}} the overhead walk.|$|R

Reidy attempted to provide a view of Guanabara Bay from each apartment unit. The single entrance to the building is via two <b>gangplanks</b> {{that lead to the}} third floor; its location at the middle of the building mitigated the need for elevators. The first and second floor consist of single-level studio apartments with a view to the city. The third floor is reserved for administrative offices, a children's theater, nursery, and kindergarten. The upper levels contain two-story family units accessed from the fourth and sixth floors; the main living quarters are on the lower level and bedrooms on the upper level.|$|R
50|$|As Noah single-handedly {{completes the}} ark (an {{impressive}} but not Biblically accurate craft with a helm, thousands of luxury cabins, {{and other features}} more suited to a modern cruise liner), the animals arrive en masse. Kairel has been sent along to organize and supervise the trip, but the procession grinds to a halt when the herbivores demand assurance that the carnivores won't devour them once they're aboard. Xiro fails to make a decision, allowing Dagnino to gain the animals' respect by declaring that he will personally punish any act of violence on the voyage. As the rain begins to fall, the animals stampede onto the ark. Xiro's selected companion Bruma pauses to taunt the doomed Kairel, only to be smashed through the <b>gangplanks</b> by a toppling hippopotamus. Xiro impulsively grabs Kairel and brings her aboard the ark in Bruma's place.|$|R
40|$|This lecture {{deals with}} the {{application}} problems of convertibility GPS system at paddle excavator K 800. The claims of the modern operating surface mining of the excavators {{requires a lot of}} information for monitoring of mining process, capacity mining, selective extraction etc. The utilization of monitoring the excavator setting by GPS system proved to be the only one proper because the receivers are resistant to the vibration, dust, temperature divergence and weather changeable. Only the direct contact with communications satellite is required. It means that they can´t be located in a metal construction space (shadow caused by construction elements, influence of electrical high voltage cables) even they can´t be located close to the paddle wheel on the paddle boom (shadow possibility caused by cuttinng edge created during lower <b>gangplanks</b> mining). This is the reason that GPS receivers are set uppermost on the metal construction excavator and the mathematical formulation is required for determination of paddle wheel petting. The relations for calculation of the paddle wheel coordinate were defined mathematically and after that the mathematical model was composed...|$|R
2500|$|Wooding up {{could be}} dangerous, as the wood was split into large baulks and {{generally}} {{had to be}} carried up a narrow <b>gangplank</b> on to the steamer. [...] Loss of life could occur if a crew man fell into the river while wooding up. [...] In an accident in early October 1878, most of the crew of Orient were thrown into the water while wooding up when a wharf depot gave way. [...] No one was drowned, but one crewman sustained injuries from being struck by {{a large piece of}} wood.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{immigrants}} only {{intended to}} stay in Britain for a few years, but although a number returned to the Caribbean, the majority remained to settle permanently. The arrival of the passengers has become an important landmark {{in the history of}} modern Britain, and the image of West Indians filing off its <b>gangplank</b> has come to symbolise the beginning of modern British multicultural society. In 1998 the area in front of the Tate Library in Brixton was renamed [...] "Windrush Square" [...] to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of the Windrush.|$|E
2500|$|On January 11, 1907, Rosalie {{assisted}} at {{the wreck}} of the Alice Gertrude which in a fog had run around on Clallam Reef. [...] In 1908, Rosalie managed to ram the then new steam ferry West Seattle. [...] Also in 1908, the Puget Sound Navigation company, which had purchased the steel steamer Chippewa found the newly acquired ship expensive to operate, and so Rosalie replaced Chippewa on the Victoria run in the off-season. [...] Rosalie was standing by at Colman Dock on May 19, 1912, when Flyer had extended her <b>gangplank</b> improperly, causing it to collapse and throw people that had been on it into the water. [...] The crew of Rosalie lowered a boat to assist the fireboat Snoqualmie and the launch Skeeter in rescuing the people. Despite these efforts, two passengers drowned.|$|E
50|$|Darrough {{enlisted in}} the Army from Concord, Illinois, on August 12, 1862. He served in Company F of the 113th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and by October 10, 1864, had reached the rank of sergeant. On that day, his {{regiment}} was dispatched from Memphis, Tennessee, to Eastport, Mississippi, to destroy train tracks and a bridge used by the Confederates. The regiment was transported up the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers by two steam-powered gunboats. As the men disembarked from the boats onto the south bank of the Tennessee River just downstream of Eastport, they came under fire from a concealed battery of Confederate artillery. The battery was at close range, and its fire proved devastating to both {{the men and the}} boats. The gunboats immediately withdrew from the shore, without having time to take up their <b>gangplanks.</b> The men on shore, including Darrough, were now stranded and under intense fire. As one boat engaged the Confederates, the other proceeded downstream and, after reaching a point which was partly out of range of the artillery, pulled alongside the shore and took on all the soldiers who had reached that point.|$|R

2500|$|The tows {{containing}} the Dubliners were delayed {{by the current}} and came in thirty minutes late at [...] The shore appeared lifeless following the bombardment but as the boats were about to land, the Ottoman defenders opened fire. Guns in the fort and castle enfiladed the beach and killed {{many of the men}} in the boats, some of which drifted away with no survivors. Many more casualties were suffered as the Dubliners waded ashore and some wounded men drowned. The survivors found shelter under the bank on the far side of the beach but most of the landing boats remained grounded with their crews dead around them. Two platoons landed intact on the right flank at the Camber and some troops reached the village, only to be overrun. Of the [...] in the landing, [...] killed and many of the rest were wounded. The River Clyde grounded just before the tows and to connect the collier to the shore, a steam hopper, the Argyll a flat-bottomed boat, was to beach ahead of it to provide a floating bridge, connecting the <b>gangplanks</b> in the bow of the River Clyde to the beach but the Argyll swung out to port and ended up broadside to the beach. The captain of the River Clyde, Commander Edward Unwin, led men outside to manhandle three lighters (transport boats) on the starboard side forward instead. Two companies of Munsters emerged from the sally ports, covered by the machine-guns on the bow and moved down the gangways to reach the shore but many were hit by bullets. Some troops managed to get ashore and others were drowned due to the weight of their equipment. Around [...] another company made an attempt to disembark but after one company had got ashore, the casualties to the first two platoons were so great, that the effort was suspended until dark.|$|R
