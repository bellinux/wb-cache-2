2500|$|Four caryatids are {{attached}} to each corner of a granite mausoleum (...) [...] They each have wings and stand with their hands clasped {{in front of their}} waist with their eyes closed. The placement has their heads touching the roof of the mausoleum and their bare feet rest on a low ledge. Two of the figures have braided hair, one has hair that hangs <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulders and the final figure has a cape pulled around her head. The back of the mausoleum has a stained glass window showing an angel holding a scroll that is inscribed with the word Peace.|$|E
60|$|Miss Alice cantered {{forward with}} a smile, but pulled her hat <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> eyes as she joined her mother. She was blushing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thought I {{was afraid}} to come alone, didn't you? Well, you see, I'm not. There!" [...] She made another dive at her hat and hair, and brought the hat <b>down</b> wickedly <b>over</b> <b>her</b> eyebrows. [...] "Gimme my plants." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{old woman}} went away after folding the <b>down</b> coverlet {{carefully}} <b>over</b> <b>her</b> darling's feet, and Helen {{seemed to go}} to sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor little things!" [...] said Margaret laughing. [...] "It is only my foible {{for making}} a thing look nice. And, Ethel," [...] she added, drawing <b>her</b> <b>down</b> close <b>over</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "I did not think the trouble wasted, if seeing me look fresher cheered up dear papa a moment." ...|$|R
60|$|She had {{her arms}} around the Doctor's neck, and he leant his head <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her,</b> {{mingling}} his grey hair with her dark brown tresses.|$|E
60|$|She {{saw that}} her mother wished to speak, and leaned <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her,</b> for Madame Duchesne could not as yet raise her voice above a whisper.|$|E
60|$|She {{was not at}} work; she was not pausing over it. Her head hung <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> breast; {{her hands}} and arms lay {{helpless}} on the desk.|$|E

50|$|Suddenly, {{the process}} is reversed; Amy recovers and Lucy dies. Overwhelmed by Lucy's {{sacrifice}} and his inability to save her, Mulder breaks <b>down</b> sobbing <b>over</b> <b>her</b> body. He later tells Scully he suspects that she died not only to save Amy, but to forget what Wade did to her all those years ago.|$|R
60|$|At first, to Anne Mie, who {{was still}} singing <b>her</b> melancholy ditty <b>over</b> <b>her</b> work in the kitchen, there had seemed nothing unusual in the {{peremptory}} ring at the front-door bell. She pulled <b>down</b> <b>her</b> sleeves <b>over</b> <b>her</b> thin arms, smoothed down her cooking apron, then only did she run to see who the visitor might be.|$|R
6000|$|CHRIS--[Goes {{slowly over}} to her chair.] It's good--for see you--after all dem years, Anna. [He bends <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her.</b> After an embarrassed {{struggle}} they manage to kiss each other.] ...|$|E

60|$|Helen gazed strangely at her bruised wrists, {{at the one}} {{stocking}} {{that hung}} <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoe-top, at the rent which had bared her shoulder to the profane gaze of those grinning, beady-eyed Mexicans.|$|E
50|$|Her film résumé {{includes}} {{roles in}} Bring It On, Exposed, The In-Laws, Nancy Drew, Sabrina <b>Down</b> Under, <b>Over</b> <b>Her</b> Dead Body, She's Out of My League, The Other Guys and The Accidental Husband.

60|$|The sun glared <b>down</b> {{fiercely}} <b>over</b> <b>her</b> dark {{figure as}} {{she stopped and}} for an instant looked stealthily around her. She moved to advance, and Antonina saw no more. Again she turned to renew her hopeless flight; and again her father--perceiving only as the mysterious cause of her dread a solitary woman, who, though she followed, attempted not to arrest, or even to address them--prepared to accompany her to the last, in despair of all other chances of securing her safety.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm awful tired. It's awful cold. My feet hurt awfully. Carl dear, oh, pleassssse {{take me home}} now. I want my mamma. Maybe she won't whip me now. It's so dark and--ohhhhhh----" [...] She muttered, incoherently: [...] "There! By the road! He's {{waiting for}} us!" [...] She sank <b>down,</b> <b>her</b> arm <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face, groaning, [...] "Don't hurt me!" ...|$|R
60|$|Elsie {{started toward}} the door, near which were {{gathered}} in groups some twenty or thirty girls. One big girl with a black straw hat tipped <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> eyes {{stepped in front of}} her.|$|E
60|$|Felicity said nothing. She {{kept looking}} down at the grass on which she sat, absently pulling at the slender blades. Presently we saw two big tears roll <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> cheeks. The Story Girl looked surprised.|$|E
60|$|He stooped <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her,</b> and {{fastened}} his lips upon her forehead. She pressed herself closer against his shoulder, and shutting her eyes, as she gave {{herself up to}} the rapture of his embrace, told herself that now all should be well with them.|$|E
60|$|As {{the words}} 'home' and 'father'--those {{household}} gods of the heart's earliest existence--struck upon her ears, a change flashed with electric suddenness over the girl's whole aspect. She raised her wan {{hands to the}} sky; all her woman's tenderness repossessed itself of her heart; and as she again knelt <b>down</b> <b>over</b> the grave, <b>her</b> sobs rose audibly through the calmed and fragrant air.|$|R
50|$|Gavin Shuker (born 10 October 1981) is an English Labour Co-operative politician, who {{has been}} the Member of Parliament (MP) for Luton South since 2010.

6000|$|... 'Thet's a knock-aht!' {{they shouted}} as Mrs. Blakeston brought her fist down on to Liza's nose; the girl {{staggered}} back, and blood began to flow. Then, losing all fear, mad with rage, {{she made a}} rush on her enemy, and rained <b>down</b> blows all <b>over</b> <b>her</b> nose and eyes and mouth. The woman recoiled at the sudden violence of the onslaught, and the men cried: ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{did not sit}} down, but {{stood behind}} Nancy and talked <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. [...] "Yes," [...] Nancy said, [...] "that's what I used to say when I was a girl. But now I'm glad I ain't a man, for I wouldn't know what to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|Presently he {{came and}} bent <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her,</b> to put {{a piece of paper}} into her hand. [...] "You will receive {{something}} in return, you are aware, my Romola?" [...] he said, gently, not minding so much what had passed, now he was secure; and feeling able to try and propitiate her.|$|E
60|$|The cowboy, {{who came}} in with her satchel, had to stoop to enter the door, and, once in, he seemed to fill the room. Florence set the lamp down upon the table. Madeline saw {{a young woman with}} a smiling, {{friendly}} face, and a profusion of fair hair hanging <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> dressing-gown.|$|E
60|$|He {{heard the}} splash {{of the lead}} as he and the white man Charly made their breakfast in the little stern cabin. Then there was a clatter of blocks, and on coming out again he found the others {{swinging}} a boat over. Charly and he {{and two of the}} Indians dropped into her, and Dampier, who had hove the schooner to, looked <b>down</b> on them <b>over</b> <b>her</b> rail.|$|R
60|$|No sound reached her, and {{she breathed}} a sigh of relief; but she forgot that the others had moved silently, and a flash of light swept up the stairs and struck her face. She was dazzled and alarmed; but with an effort she kept her self-control. It would be {{dangerous}} to be seen trying to steal away, but if she remained, looking <b>down</b> <b>over</b> the banisters, <b>her</b> presence might be accounted for.|$|R
5000|$|A 2:56 minute clip for Moon was {{released}} on June 9, 2010 in Ayumi Hamasaki's YouTube channel. The full PV {{was released}} on July 13, 2010, a day before the single was available in stores. The video featured Ayumi singing in a European aristocratic room setting. As the video progresses a strange, black, tar-like liquid begins dropping in the room, on random furniture. The video is also inter-cut with scenes of Ayumi smiling while holding one of her pet dogs, in her second verse it shown ayumi with the black liquid falling <b>down</b> all <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face, near chest and going to her hands. Depicting sorrow or despair, presumably of the dog shown {{towards the end of}} the video.|$|R
60|$|In {{this high}} train of enthusiasm, she stood, raising her eyes through the {{fractured}} {{roof of the}} vault, to the stars which now began to twinkle through the pale twilight, while the long gray tresses which hung <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulders waved in the night-breeze, which the chasm and fractured windows admitted freely.|$|E
60|$|Her golden hair, {{which she}} wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed aside, and fell <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> neck. Advancing his hand by little and little, {{he took it}} {{up and looked at}} it. In the midst of the action he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his shoemaking.|$|E
60|$|Bran {{sat down}} and watched too. The poor girl's tender hands were {{bleeding}} from the stones, while her golden tresses rolled <b>down</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> eyes, and entangled in her impatient fingers; but still she worked frantically. Bran seemed suddenly to comprehend the case, rushed to the rescue, and began digging too, with all her might.|$|E
6000|$|All three {{came to my}} room {{on their}} return home, for Emily had become aware of our scheme, and entreated {{to be allowed to}} watch with us. [...] Clarence had unfastened the alarum bell from my shutters, and taken down the bar after the {{curtains}} had been drawn by the housemaid, and he now opened them. It was a frosty moonlight night, and the lawn lay white and crisp, marked with fantastic shadows. The others looked grave and pale, Emily was in a thick white shawl and hood, with a swan's <b>down</b> boa <b>over</b> <b>her</b> black dress, a somewhat ghostly figure herself, but we were in far too serious a mood for light observations.|$|R
5|$|Julian offers Theo {{money to}} acquire transit papers {{for a young}} refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a {{government}} minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee {{in exchange for a}} large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car, and they bury Julian in the forest as Theo breaks <b>down</b> crying <b>over</b> <b>her</b> death. The group ditches their car for another to escape to a Fishes safe house.|$|R
50|$|On {{advice from}} her landlady Mrs. Hawkins (Tempe Pigott), Ivy goes to see Dr. Jekyll, {{hoping that he}} can free her of the abusive Hyde. When she arrives, Ivy sees that the celebrated Dr. Jekyll was {{the same man who}} saved her from abuse just months before. She breaks <b>down</b> in tears <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{situation}} with Hyde. Jekyll is extremely distraught over the pain that he (Hyde) has caused her and promises Ivy that she will {{never have to worry about}} Hyde again.|$|R
