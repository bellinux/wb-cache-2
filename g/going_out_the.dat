500|$|Set in {{the year}} 2249, Mercy Point {{revolves}} around doctors and nurses working in a hospital space station in deep space. The [...] "state-of-the-art hospital" [...] is described as [...] "the last stop for anything <b>going</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> first stop for anything coming back" [...] {{by one of the}} show's characters. It is noted for existing on the [...] "fringes of the galaxy", on a colony called Jericho. The facility includes advanced medical equipment, such as [...] "artificial wombs, holographic three-dimensional X-ray projections [...] zero-gravity operating tables". A talking computer known as Hippocrates, voiced by series co-creator Trey Callaway, is shown as the primary method to monitor a patient's status.|$|E

2500|$|On February 15, 2006, Schaefer made suggestive {{comments}} to Elizabeth Krum, a 24-year-old assistant to then-Governor Robert Ehrlich. Responding to Schaefer's request for tea, Krum set a thermal mug {{in front of}} him. Schaefer watched her walk away, then beckoned for her to return. When she obliged, he told her, [...] "Walk again", staring after her {{as she left the}} conference room. Schaefer initially refused to apologize, saying, [...] "She's a pretty little girl. She ought to be damn happy that I observed her <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door. The day I don't look at pretty women is the day I die." [...] (Schaefer long called the women with whom he worked [...] "little girls.") However, within days of the leering incident, Schaefer issued a handwritten letter to Krum informing her she had handled the affair as a [...] "trouper." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a {{few more}} broadsides, further {{problems}} emerged. Shrapnel from Ranger third broadside hit Lieut. Dobbs in the head, putting him out of action. Conditions on Drake gun deck were so unpredictable that the [...] "powder monkeys"—the boys who brought charges of gunpowder up for the great guns, in fire-resistant boxes—eventually became reluctant to do their duty. Twice the ship's master had to go below to urge the acting gunner to be more efficient in supplying the powder, when opportunities for broadsides were missed. Another {{problem was that the}} [...] "slow matches" [...] which were used to fire the guns kept falling into their fire-safety tubs and <b>going</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> four-pound guns could not penetrate Ranger toughened hull anyway, so Drake tried copying the technique the Americans had been using from the start: they aimed at the masts, sails and rigging, in order to slow the opponent down.|$|E

60|$|A fright I got one night, however, kept me indoors for {{the better}} part of a week. In my <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> little house door had been {{carelessly}} left unlatched.
