5|$|The heavy isotope 15N {{was first}} {{discovered}} by S. M. Naudé in 1929, soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements oxygen and carbon were discovered. It presents {{one of the}} lowest thermal neutron capture cross-sections of all isotopes. It is frequently used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen-containing molecules, due to its fractional nuclear spin of one-half, which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line width. 14N, though also theoretically usable, has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a quadrupole moment that leads to wider and less useful spectra. 15N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The low natural abundance of 15N (0.36%) significantly reduces sensitivity, a problem which is only exacerbated by its low gyromagnetic ratio, (only 10.14% that of 1H). As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio for 1H is about 300 times as much as that for 15N at the same magnetic field strength. This may be somewhat alleviated by <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichment</b> of 15N by chemical exchange or fractional distillation. 15N-enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions, they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen, unlike compounds with labelled hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere. The 15N:14N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of geochemistry, hydrology, paleoclimatology and paleoceanography, where it is called δ15N.|$|E

25|$|Assimilation of diet into tissue has a tissue-specific {{fractionation}} {{known as}} the trophic discrimination factor. Diet sources can be tracked through a food web via deuterium isotope profiles, although this is complicated by deuterium having two potential sources - water and food. Food more strongly impacts δD than does exchange with surrounding water, and that signal is seen across trophic levels. However, different organisms derive organic hydrogen in varying ratios of water to food: for example, in quail, 20-30% of organic hydrogen was from water and the remainder from food. The precise percentage of hydrogen from water was dependent on tissue source and metabolic activity. In chironomids, 31-47% of biomass hydrogen derived from water, and in microbes as much as 100% of fatty acid hydrogen {{can be derived from}} water depending on substrate. In caterpillars, diet δD from organic matter correlates linearly with tissue δD. The same relationship does not appear to hold consistently for diet δD from water, however - water derived from either the caterpillar or its prey plant is more deuterium enriched than their organic material. Going up trophic levels from prey (plant) to predator (caterpillar) results in an <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichment.</b> This same trend of enrichment is seen in many other animals - carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores - and appears to follow 15N relative abundances. Carnivores at the same trophic level tend to exhibit the same level of 2H enrichment. Because, as mentioned earlier, the amount of organic hydrogen produced from water varies between species, a model of trophic level related to absolute fractionation is difficult to make if the participating species are not known. Consistency in measuring the same tissues is also important, as different tissues fractionate deuterium differently. In aquatic systems, tracking trophic interactions is valuable for not only understanding the ecology of the system, but also for determining the degree of terrestrial input. The patterns of deuterium enrichment consistent within trophic levels is a useful tool for assessing the nature of these interactions in the environment.|$|E

25|$|Neutron {{poisoning}} and tritium {{production from}} lithium-6 - Lithium-6 {{is a strong}} neutron poison; using LiF with natural lithium, with its 7.5% lithium-6 content, prevents reactors from starting. The high neutron density in the core rapidly transmutes lithium-6 to tritium, losing neutrons that are required to sustain break-even breeding. Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, which is nearly identical, chemically, to ordinary hydrogen. In the MSR the tritium is quite mobile because, in its elemental form, it rapidly diffuses through metals at high temperature. If the lithium is isotopically enriched in lithium-7, and the isotopic separation level is high enough (99.995% lithium-7), the amount of tritium produced {{is only a few}} hundred grams per year for a 1GWe reactor. This much smaller amount of tritium comes mostly from the lithium-7 - tritium reaction and from beryllium, which can produce tritium indirectly by first transmuting to tritium-producing lithium-6. LFTR designs that use a lithium salt, choose the lithium-7 isotope. In the MSRE, lithium-6 was successfully removed from the fuel salt via <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichment.</b> Since lithium-7 is at least 16% heavier than lithium-6, and is the most common isotope, lithium-6 is comparatively easy and inexpensive to extract. Vacuum distillation of lithium achieves efficiencies of up to 8% per stage and requires only heating in a vacuum chamber. However, about one fission in 90,000 produces helium-6, which quickly decays to lithium-6 and one fission in 12,500 produces an atom of tritium directly (in all reactor types). Practical MSRs operate under a blanket of dry inert gas, usually helium. LFTRs offer a good chance to recover the tritium, since it is not highly diluted in water as in CANDU reactors. Various methods exist to trap tritium, such as hydriding it to titanium, oxidizing it to less mobile (but still volatile) forms such as sodium fluoroborate or molten nitrate salt, or trapping it in the turbine power cycle gas and offgasing it using copper oxide pellets. ORNL developed a secondary loop coolant system that would chemically trap residual tritium so that it could be removed from the secondary coolant rather than diffusing into the turbine power cycle. ORNL calculated that this would reduce Tritium emissions to acceptable levels.|$|E

40|$|The doubly labeled water (DLW, 2 H(2) 18 O) {{method is}} a highly {{accurate}} method for measuring energy expenditure (EE). A possible source of error is bolus fluid intake before body water sampling. If there is bolus fluid intake immediately before body water sampling, the saliva may reflect the ingested water disproportionately, because the ingested water {{may not have had}} time to mix fully with the body water pool. To ascertain the magnitude of this problem, EE was measured over a 5 -day period by the DLW method. Six subjects were dosed with 2 H 2 (18) O. After the reference salivas for the two-point determination were obtained, subjects drank water (700 - 1, 000 ml), and serial saliva samples were collected for the next 3 h. Expressing the postbolus saliva enrichments {{as a percentage of the}} prebolus value, we found 1) a minimum in the saliva <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichments</b> were reached at approximately 30 min with the minimum for 2 H (95. 48 +/- 0. 43 %) being significantly lower than the minimum for 18 O (97. 55 +/- 0. 44, P less than 0. 05) and 2) EE values calculated using the postbolus <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichments</b> are appreciably higher (19. 9 +/- 7. 5 %) than the prebolus reference values.

40|$|RationaleThe doubly {{labelled}} water (DLW) {{method is}} a stable isotopic technique for measuring total energy expenditure (TEE). Saliva {{is the easiest}} sampling fluid for assessing <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichments,</b> but blood is considered superior because of its rapid exchange with body water. Therefore, we compared a large range of <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichments</b> in saliva and blood, and related TEE in subjects with their ad libitum total energy intake (TEI). The relevance of these parameters to body weight and fat change over an 8 -day interval was also assessed. MethodsThirty subjects underwent DLW analysis over either 8 or 14 days, during which time initial and final blood and saliva enrichments were compared. TEI was assessed by dieticians over the 8 -day period only. Isotope ratio mass spectrometry {{was used for the}} measurement of H- 2 and O- 18 values. ResultsNo discrepancies were observed between sampling fluids over a wide range of enrichments. During the 8 -day period, average TEI exceeded TEE by similar to 5 % or less. Using saliva as sampling fluid, TEI and TEI-TEE, but not TEE, were positively correlated to body weight change. TEI-TEE and physical activity EE (AEE), but not TEI, correlated, respectively, positively and negatively to changes in fat mass. ConclusionsThe DLW method in humans can be reliably applied using saliva as sampling fluid. TEI-TEE as well as AEE contributes significantly to changes in fat mass over an 8 -day period.

Stratopause is the peak-height of the δ 18 OOO value, and it rose to 18 %. The δ 18 OOO has a positive correlation with temperature in the range of 220 – 255 K, indicating that temperature can be a dominant factor to control the vertical profile of δ 18 OOO in the stratosphere and mesosphere.
