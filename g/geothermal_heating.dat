5|$|Direct <b>geothermal</b> <b>heating</b> systems contain {{pumps and}} compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This {{parasitic}} load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of <b>geothermal</b> <b>heating</b> may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct <b>geothermal</b> <b>heating</b> applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E
