5000|$|Metro, (officially {{known as}} Microsoft <b>design</b> <b>language</b> or MDL), is a <b>design</b> <b>language</b> created by Microsoft.

50|$|Handel-C is a {{high-level}} programming language which targets low-level hardware, {{most commonly used}} in the programming of FPGAs. It is a rich subset of C, with non-standard extensions to control hardware instantiation {{with an emphasis on}} parallelism. Handel-C is to hardware design what the first high-level programming languages were to programming CPUs. Unlike many other <b>design</b> <b>languages</b> that target a specific architecture Handel-C can be compiled to a number of <b>design</b> <b>languages</b> and then synthesised to the corresponding hardware. This frees developers to concentrate on the programming task at hand rather than the idiosyncrasies of a specific design language and architecture.|$|E
