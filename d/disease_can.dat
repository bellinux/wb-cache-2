5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The <b>disease</b> <b>can</b> also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The <b>disease</b> <b>can</b> also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E
5|$|In a {{land where}} {{approximately}} 90% of the original island forest has been destroyed, ruffed lemurs cling to {{only a small fraction}} of their original range. Completely dependent upon large fruiting trees, neither species appears to be flexible with its habitat choice, with selective logging resulting in significantly lower population densities. Although they can survive in very disturbed habitats with lower population densities, they are still especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Decreased genetic diversity, in tandem with hunting, natural disasters, predation, and <b>disease,</b> <b>can</b> easily wipe out small populations.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{and kidney}} <b>disease</b> <b>can</b> affect the {{biological}} activity of analgesics. When people with diminishing liver or kidney function {{are treated with}} oral opioids they must be monitored for the possible need to reduce dose, extend dosing intervals, or switch to other opioids or other modes of delivery. The benefit of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be weighed against their gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks.|$|E

5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental <b>disease</b> <b>can</b> give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both {{in the interest of the}} detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} Chagas disease {{are due to}} cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an inflammatory response, cellular lesions, and fibrosis. For example, intracellular amastigotes destroy the intramural neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart aneurysms, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas <b>disease</b> <b>can</b> be fatal, in most cases due to heart muscle damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{induction}} phase is to reach a complete remission. Complete remission {{does not mean the}} disease has been cured; rather, it signifies no <b>disease</b> <b>can</b> be detected with available diagnostic methods. Complete remission is obtained in about 50%–75% of newly diagnosed adults, although this may vary based on the prognostic factors described above. The length of remission depends on the prognostic features of the original leukemia. In general, all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy.|$|E

5|$|When {{properly}} treated, {{people with}} malaria can usually expect a complete recovery. However, severe malaria can progress extremely rapidly and cause death within hours or days. In {{the most severe}} cases of the disease, fatality rates can reach 20%, even with intensive care and treatment. Over the longer term, developmental impairments have been documented in children who have suffered episodes of severe malaria. Chronic infection without severe <b>disease</b> <b>can</b> occur in an immune-deficiency syndrome associated with a decreased responsiveness to Salmonella bacteria and the Epstein–Barr virus.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} {{typically}} treated with dietary changes and medication. Dietary changes involve eating a low copper diet and not using copper cookware. Medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d-penicillamine and zinc supplements. Complications of Wilson's <b>disease</b> <b>can</b> include liver failure, liver cancer, and kidney problems. A liver transplant {{may be helpful}} in those in whom other treatments are not effective or if liver failure occurs.|$|E

5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme <b>disease</b> <b>can</b> debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Bradykinesia (slowness of movement) {{is found}} in every case of PD, and is due to {{disturbances}} in motor planning of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities {{at the same time}} and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's <b>disease</b> <b>can</b> often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires a patient to do repetitive movements with their fingers and feet.|$|E
5|$|Elephant endotheliotropic {{herpesvirus}}es (EEHV) or Elephantid herpesvirus 1' {{is a type}} of herpesvirus, {{which can}} cause a highly fatal hemorrhagic disease when transmitted to young Asian elephants. In African elephants, related forms of these viruses, which have been identified in wild populations, are generally benign, occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions. However, some types of EEHV can cause a highly fatal disease in Asian elephants, which kills up to 80% of severely affected individuals. The <b>disease</b> <b>can</b> be treated with the rapid application of antiviral drugs, but this has only been effective in around a third of cases.|$|E

5|$|Fairley {{travelled}} to New Guinea {{at the end}} of June 1943 {{and arranged}} for Plasmodium falciparum cases to be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns was only a few hours, this was considered safe, but since the <b>disease</b> <b>can</b> be fatal if not treated promptly, Fairley was concerned lest the cases be delayed for some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley himself. Because movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was added on the end. Priority Neill soon came to be applied to the entire Cairns project.|$|E
5|$|Like many mammals, {{elephants}} can {{contract and}} transmit diseases to humans, {{one of which}} is tuberculosis. , tuberculosis appears to be widespread among captive elephants in the US, and because the <b>disease</b> <b>can</b> spread through the air to infect both humans and other animals, it is a public health concern affecting circuses and zoos. In 2012, two elephants in Tete d'Or zoo, Lyon were diagnosed with the disease. Due to the threat of transmitting tuberculosis to other animals or visitors to the zoo, their euthanasia was initially ordered by city authorities but a court later overturned this decision. At an elephant sanctuary in Tennessee, a 54-year-old African elephant was considered to be the source of tuberculosis infections among eight workers.|$|E
5|$|Neck rot is a {{fungal disease}} {{affecting}} onions in storage. It {{is caused by}} Botrytis allii, which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of spores are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed dressings are available and the <b>disease</b> <b>can</b> be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.|$|E
