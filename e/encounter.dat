5|$|The {{adventure}} {{is divided}} into 27 encounters across a 16-page module. Encounters are varied and each presents its own challenges. <b>Encounter</b> seven necessitates characters jumping from platform to platform above a sea of hot mud whilst evading erupting geysers; this in turn leads to <b>encounter</b> eight and a room of permanent darkness where a vampire guards Whelm. <b>Encounter</b> 17 occurs in a giant but fragile bubble located above a boiling lake, with the players needing to defeat a giant crab and retrieve Wave without damaging the bubble. <b>Encounter</b> 26 involves negotiating a magical ziggurat populated by various monsters (including sea lions, giant crayfish, giant scorpions, and manticores) before <b>encounter</b> 28, a battle against an ogre mage who possesses Blackrazor. A final challenge on departing is an <b>encounter</b> with two to four efreet if the characters have succeeded in taking {{two or three of}} the magical weapons.|$|E

One group of normal six-year-old children completed 20 play <b>encounters,</b> while a second groUp of clinic-referred children completed 15 play <b>encounters.</b> Each child <b>encountered</b> either atrained/supervised or an untrained/unsupervised college undergraduate. Analyses of videotapes {{made of the}} "non-directive " play <b>encounters</b> indicated that the Children who <b>encountered</b> trained/supervised undergraduates emitted greater r-numbers of fantasy behaviors, especially thoge indicative of mature, coping and adaptive functioning than did children <b>encountering</b> untrained/unsupervised undergraduates. Adult involvement in play and allowing the child self-direction seemed key behaviors in eliciting such child behavior.

Females feeding on a mushroom were observed biting, kicking, lunging, and posturing when they contacted one another. Males and females in a laboratory study showed similar levels of agonism in same-sex <b>encounters,</b> with no agonism in about 31-36% of <b>encounters,</b> threat in 42-48% of <b>encounters,</b> kicking or biting by one cockroach in 19-20% of <b>encounters,</b> and kicking or biting by both cockroaches in 2% of <b>encounters.</b>|$|R
5|$|Approximately every 2.5 or 2.6 years, {{the object}} {{comes back to}} the point in the solar system where the 1990 <b>encounter</b> occurred, and the earth {{comes back to the}} same point every year.

5|$|Batygin and Brown {{suggested}} Planet Nine was a primordial giant planet core {{that was}} ejected from its initial orbit by an <b>encounter</b> with Jupiter during the nebular epoch of the Solar System {{and was later}} perturbed into a stable orbit by a distant <b>encounter</b> with a passing star or by the solar nebula. Others have proposed that it was captured {{in a similar manner}} from another star, or that it formed on a very distant circular orbit and was perturbed into its current eccentric orbit during a distant <b>encounter</b> with another star.|$|E

Hence, for the most part, Voyager 2 mission relied on preloaded commands for the Neptune <b>encounter.</b> The spacecraft performed a near-encounter with the moon Nereid before it came within 4,400km of Neptune's atmosphere on 25 August, then passed close to the planet's largest moon Triton later the same day.|$|E
40|$|Advisory service <b>encounters</b> {{change their}} {{character}} from expertise provision to interactive problem solving, thus increasingly relying on mutual and intensive {{interaction between the}} advisor and the advisee: they turn into interactive advisory service <b>encounters.</b> Simultaneously, modern collaborative IT finds its way into service <b>encounters</b> as a method to engineer, enrich, and standardize them. An IT system equipped with interactive features may enhance the <b>encounter’s</b> interactivity, {{but it may also}} limit it by capturing participants’ attention. This study explores the influence of IT on the interactivity in advisory service <b>encounters.</b> It arrives at the conclusion that an extensive tuning in precedes a phase of enhanced interactivity in IT-supported advisory service <b>encounters...</b>|$|R

40|$|Socioecological theory {{suggests}} that between-group competition {{is an important factor}} affecting the nature of primate social relationships. Between-group <b>encounters</b> in macaques may involve female resource defense, male mate defense, and male resource defense. We observed between-group <b>encounters</b> in two groups (a forest group and a temple group) of bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata). We observed 102 <b>encounters</b> in 875 h of observation of the forest group (1. 40 per 12 -h day) and 58 <b>encounters</b> in 907 h of observation of the temple group (0. 77 per 12 -h day). Aggressive interactions between groups occurred in 32. 4 % and 29. 3 % of <b>encounters</b> in the forest and temple groups, respectively. Overall, we found little support for the female resource defense hypothesis. Females in both groups rarely participated aggressively in between-group <b>encounters.</b> We found support for the male mate defense hypothesis. For example, males of the forest group were more aggressive during <b>encounters</b> in the mating season than in the non-mating season. Males were also aggressive to females from their own group immediately following <b>encounters.</b> We also found partial support for the male resource defense hypothesis. <b>Encounters</b> in the forest group occurred in a feeding context more often than expected based on time budgets. Also, males in the temple group were more often aggressive in food-related <b>encounters</b> than in other <b>encounters.</b> The findings {{of this study suggest that}} socioecological models of primate social relationships need to distinguish male and female strategies during between-group <b>encounters</b> and integrate the resulting functional outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This study {{examines}} customer satisfaction {{with a series}} of hotel services. Five service <b>encounters</b> were examined in a sample of business travelers (n = 140) who had stayed in Hong Kong hotels. Overall satisfaction and repurchase intention were differentially impacted by the various service <b>encounters.</b> Business center <b>encounters</b> had the greatest effect on business traveler satisfaction, followed by check-out and check-in <b>encounters.</b> Interestingly, room and restaurant <b>encounters</b> had the least impact on satisfaction. The delivery of good core services alone cannot guarantee customer satisfaction. Hotels must also pay attention to peripheral service delivery, because these <b>encounters</b> help to shape the customer's overall level of satisfaction and repurchase intention.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{individual}} online information <b>encountering</b> (IE) experience and investigate the effects of their personal characteristics on IE experience. The study were conducted a qualitative research and a total of 11 respondents were interviewed. The results were as follows: Most online <b>encountered</b> information could satisfy the individual's present and future information needs. Most people acquire <b>encountered</b> information by themselves, and the <b>encountered</b> information came from various sources on the web. Frequent Internet users could be more sensitive to information than others. Moreover, people with higher intrinsic motivation, usually interested or curious about many things, are easy to acquire online IE experience. After having online IE experience, the individuals occasionally feel anxious because of time pressure, furthermore, they want to avoid <b>encountering</b> more information. However, most individuals feel novel and joyful while they <b>encountered</b> information. They even further process <b>encountering</b> information resources and expect to gain more experience about information <b>encountering.</b> In addition, the ideal environments of online information <b>encountering</b> include no commercial advertising, credibility, and a personalized database with the powerful searchable function. 本研究目的在瞭解個體的線上資訊偶遇經驗情形，以及個體所具備的個人特徵對其線上資訊偶遇經驗的影響。本研究分析 11 位受訪者的資訊偶遇經驗並整合研究發現後，得出以下結論並提出後續的實務建議：線上偶遇資訊多為滿足個體現在及未來的資訊需求，且多由自己獲得、資訊來源廣泛。較常接觸並使用網路者，對自己的資訊敏感度具相當信心。內在學習動機較高、對許多事物都感興趣、或好奇心重的個體均易產生線上資訊偶遇經驗。個體偶爾會因資訊的繁雜或時間壓力而對於線上資訊偶遇經驗感到焦慮不安，進而產生想要逃避資訊偶遇的念頭，然多數個體仍會對偶遇資訊感到新奇喜悅，並進一步處理獲取之資訊資源，以期促進更多的資訊偶遇經驗產生。理想的線上資訊偶遇環境是無商業廣告、具公信力、具強大檢索功能的個人化資料庫。頁次： 16 - 3...|$|R
