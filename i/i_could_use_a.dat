2500|$|Allen {{was said}} to be {{sensitive}} about having one green eye and one blue eye (heterochromia), and some speculation existed that plans to film the eighth season of The Burns & Allen Show in color prompted her retirement. However, this seems unlikely, since a one-time-only color episode was filmed and broadcast in 1954 (a clip of which was seen on a CBS anniversary show). The reason she retired in 1958 was her health; George Burns noted more than once that she stayed with the television show as long as she did to please him, in spite of her health problems. In later years, Burns admitted that he had a very brief affair. Stricken by guilt, he phoned Jack Benny and told him about the indiscretion. However, Allen overheard the conversation and Burns quietly bought an expensive centerpiece. Nothing more was said. Years later, he discovered that Allen had subsequently told one of her friends about the episode, finishing with, [...] "You know, I really wish George would cheat on me again. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> new centerpiece." ...|$|E

6000|$|But when I {{found that}} Biddy could never succeed in getting near {{her in the}} pasture, and that any kind of success in the milking {{operations}} required my vigorous personal exertions morning and evening, the matter wore a more serious aspect, and I began to feel quite pensive and apprehensive. It is very well {{to talk of the}} pleasures of the milkmaid going out in the balmy freshness of the purple dawn; but imagine a poor fellow pulled out of bed on a drizzly, rainy morning, and equipping himself for a scamper through a wet pasture lot, rope in hand, at the heels of such a termagant as mine! In fact, madam established a regular series of exercises, which had all to be gone through before she would suffer herself to be captured; as, first, she would station herself plump {{in the middle of a}} marsh, which lay at the lower part of the lot, and look very innocent and absent-minded, as if reflecting on some sentimental subject. [...] "Suke! Suke! Suke!" [...] I ejaculate, cautiously tottering along the edge of the marsh, and holding out an ear of corn. The lady looks gracious, and comes forward, almost within reach of my hand. I make a plunge to throw the rope over her horns, and away she goes, kicking up mud and water into my face in her flight, while I, losing my balance, tumble forward into the marsh. I pick myself up, and, full of wrath, behold her placidly chewing her cud on the other side, with the meekest air imaginable, as who should say, [...] "I hope you are not hurt, sir." [...] I dash through swamp and bog furiously, resolving to carry all by a coup de main. Then follows a miscellaneous season of dodging, scampering, and bopeeping, among the trees of the grove, interspersed with sundry occasional races across the bog aforesaid. I always wondered how I caught her every day; and when I had tied her head to one post and her heels to another, I wiped the sweat from my brow, and thought I was paying dear for the eccentricities of genius. A genius she certainly was, for besides her surprising agility, she had other talents equally extraordinary. There was no fence that she could not take down; nowhere that she could not go. She took the pickets off the garden fence at her pleasure, using her horns as handily as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> claw hammer. Whatever she had a mind to, whether it were a bite in the cabbage garden, or a run in the corn patch, or a foraging expedition into the flower borders, she made herself equally welcome and at home. Such a scampering and driving, such cries of [...] "Suke here" [...] and [...] "Suke there," [...] as constantly greeted our ears, kept our little establishment in a constant commotion. At last, when she one morning made a plunge at the skirts of my new broadcloth frock coat, and carried off one flap on her horns, my patience gave out, and I determined to sell her.|$|E

40|$|Logic is {{traditionally}} {{taken to be}} the systematic study of inference, drawing new conclusions {{as a means of}} elucidating or ‘unpacking ’ information that is implicit in the given premises. This is the sense in which, for instance, the conclusion B of a typical propositional inference ‘from A∨B, ¬A to B ’ tells us more about the situations satisfying the two premises. Inferences like this drive mathematical proof, automated deduction in computers, and the minds of the many people on buses and trains today doing their daily Sudoku puzzles, which involve long strings of propositional inferences. But there is much more to information flow than deduction inside one’s own mind! The following list occurs with many authors, going back far into the Western – and the Indian – logical tradition. Suppose I want to know if a proposition P is true. Perhaps the easiest way of finding out is through observation: I just look at the relevant situation and see if P is the case. Only if this is not feasible for me, since P is about some remote, or otherwise inaccessible situation, I might try the option of inference, trying to deduce P or its negation from the stock of propositions already at my disposal. Finally, if this second road does not help either, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> third method, step out of my individual setting, and ask som...|$|E

40|$|For the {{treatment}} of patients with cystic fibrosis, recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I is widely used. Deoxyribonuclease I has {{a positive effect on}} lung function and the number of hospitalizations. Deoxyribonuclease I is currently administered by nebulization, which is an inefficient administration method. For expensive drugs, such as deoxyribonuclease I, dry powder inhalation would be advantageous due to increased deposition efficiency, patient mobility and compliance. Furthermore, a significant cost reduction may be obtained.
