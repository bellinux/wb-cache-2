5000|$|When forming {{technical}} {{ceramic materials}} from dry powders prepared for processing, {{the method of}} forming into the shape required depends upon the method of material preparation and {{size and shape of}} the part to be formed. Materials prepared for dry powder forming are most commonly formed by [...] "dry" [...] pressing in mechanical or hydraulic powder compacting presses selected for the necessary force and powder fill depth. Dry powder is automatically discharged into the non-flexible steel or tungsten carbide insert in the die and punches then compact the powder to the shape of the die. If the part is to be large and unable to have pressure transmit suitably for a uniform pressed density then isostatic pressing may be used. When iso-statically pressed the powder takes the shape of a flexible membrane acting as the mould, forming the shape and size of the pressed powder. <b>Isostatic</b> <b>presses</b> can be either high speed, high output type of automatic presses for such parts as ceramic insulators for spark plugs or sand blast nozzles, or slower operating [...] "wet bag" [...] presses that are much more manual in operation but suitable particularly for large machinable blanks or blanks that will be cut or otherwise formed in secondary operations to the final shape.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Selective Laser Sintering could {{manufacture}} high complex {{metal parts}} in short time but with high porosity and low strength. The components from Cold <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressing</b> have excellent performance with uniform organizational structure, high size precision, and high density. It, however, could not form high complex parts {{because of the}} difficulties of bag manufacture. So {{it will be a}} good method to combine Selective Laser Sintering and Cold <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressing</b> to make complicated metal parts. In this paper, the specimens of stainless steel were made by the combined Selective Laser Sintering and Cold <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressing</b> forming route. And the simulation of Cold <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressing</b> was carried out by finite element method and Drucker-Prager-Cap constitutive model in ABAQUS/Explicit computer program. The property of metal powder was measured by experiments. The effects of bag on Cold <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressing</b> have been discussed. It is different from the Cold <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressing</b> of metal powder that the bag has little influence on both shape and size of the specimen. The results of simulation show a good agreement between the experimental results and the calculated results.

Specifically, we investigate the feasibility of estimating a particular state (grain size) of the HIP nonlinear system dynamics from measurements of the system's output (density) and inputs (applied temperature and applied pressure).

40|$|AbstractPrestressed wire winded {{framework}} (PWWF) is {{an advanced}} {{structure and the}} most expensive part in the large-scale equipment. The traditional design of PWWF is complicated, highly iterative and cost uncontrolable, because PWWF is a variable stiffness multi-agent structure, with non-linear loading and deformation coordination. In this paper, cost optimization method of large-scale PWWF by multiple-island genetic algorithm (MIGA) is presented. Optimization design flow and optimization model are proposed based on variable-tension wire winding theory. An example of the PWWF cost optimization of isostatic equipment with axial load 6 000 kN is given. The optimization cost is reduced by 21. 6 % compared with traditional design. It has also been verified by the finite-element analysis and successfully applied to an actual PWWF design of <b>isostatic</b> <b>press.</b> The results show that this method is efficient and reliable. This method can also provide a guide for optimal design for ultra-large dimension muti-frame structure of 546 MN and 907 MN <b>isostatic</b> <b>press</b> equipment...|$|R
40|$|Films of {{titanium}} nitride deposited by {{physical vapor deposition}} on 304 L stainless steel substrates were hot <b>isostatic</b> <b>pressed</b> (HIP) under 150 MPa at 550 °C. To {{study the effects of}} this treatment on the microstructure of those films, X-ray diffraction analyses, Rutherford Backscattering spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy were performed.

The hot isostatic pressure leads to an increase of hardness for depths up to 0. 1 µm and a crystallographic texture change from (111) to (200). The original TiN golden color turned to red after the treatment. An increase of the grain size has been observed for hot <b>isostatic</b> <b>pressed</b> samples, but the stoichiometry of the TiN film was determined to be 1 : 1 by RBS.

40|$|Abstract — Cobalt-based alloys {{are known}} for their {{excellent}} wear resistance, particularly under high temperature and corrosive environments. However the cast cobalt-based alloys have relatively high brittleness, and low toughness, due to their coarse carbide structure. This paper aims to comprehend if carbide refinement, caused by changing the processing route from sand casting to powder consolidated Hot <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressing</b> (HIPing), can improve the tribo-mechanical properties of cobalt-based alloys. The alloy selected for this investigation had a nominal wt. % composition of Co- 30 Cr- 14 W- 1 C, which is similar to the composition of the commercially available Stellite® 4 alloy. The Hot <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Pressed</b> (HIPed) alloy had a much finer microstructure than the cast alloy, which showed a typical hypoeutectic dendritic microstructure. Both alloys had similar hardness. Although the cast alloy showed slightly better abrasive and sliding wear resistance than the HIPed alloy due to their coarser eutectic carbides, the HIPed alloy had a significant advantage on the impact toughness and contact fatigue performance. The results of this comparative investigation indicated that the HIPed alloy had an attractive combination of tribo-mechanical properties, i. e. improved impact and fatigue resistance, whilst preserving the high hardness and good wear resistance associated with the cast alloy, making it suitable for relatively higher stress applications...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Yttria-stabilized {{zirconia}} (Y-TZP) ceramic is {{a high-performance}} material with excellent mechanical properties suitable for fixed partial dentures. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate after fatigue testing, the effect of heat-treatment and veneering on the fracture resistance of frameworks manufactured using sintered and subsequently hot <b>isostatic</b> <b>pressed</b> yttrium oxide partially-stabilized zirconia (Denzir). METHODS: The specimens were subjected to dynamic loading in water. Thereafter, using a universal testing machine, the fracture resistance of three-unit fixed partial dentures was determined; (i) of the frameworks as delivered after machining, (ii) after the frameworks had been subjected to heat-treatment similar to veneering with a glass-ceramic (Eris) or a feldspar-based ceramic (Vita D) and (iii) after the frameworks had been veneered with these ceramics. In addition, the fracture resistance of frameworks as delivered after machining not subjected to dynamic loading in water was determined. RESULTS: Cyclic loading in water did not significantly (p> 0. 05) affect the fracture resistance. The load necessary to fracture the frameworks as delivered after machining was significantly (p 0. 05). For all but three specimens the fractures were located in the loading point and through one of the connectors.

40|$|Currently, three {{methods are}} {{commonly}} used for producing porous NiTi shape memory alloys (SMAs) from elemental powders. These include conventional sintering, Self-propagating High temperature Synthesis (SHS), and sintering at elevated pressure via a Hot <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Press</b> (HIP). Conventional sintering requires long heating times and samples are limited in shape and pore size. SHS is initiated by a thermal explosion ignited {{at one end of}} the specimen, which then propagates through the specimen in a self-sustaining manner. One of the difficulties with SHS is the inability to control intermetallic phases. This work will focus on the fabrication and characterization of porous NiTi SMA material produced from elemental powders via HIPping. Porous NiTi SMA was produced from elemental Ni and Ti powders at elevated temperature and pressure using a Hot <b>Isostatic</b> <b>Press</b> (HIP). Small and large pore specimens containing average pore sizes ranging from 20 microns up to 1 mm have been produced by slightly varying the HIPping sintering temperatures and times.
