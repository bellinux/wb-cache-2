5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found {{that half of the}} difference between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant women. When taking into account the health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It has been somewhat successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>situation.</b> Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E

25|$|Even the {{youngest}} children quickly learn that, {{with varying degrees}} of probability, consequences flow from physical acts and omissions. The more predictable the outcome, the greater the likelihood that the actor caused the injury or loss intentionally. There are many ways in which the law might capture this simple rule of practical experience: that there is a natural flow to events, that a reasonable man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>situation</b> would have foreseen this consequence as likely to occur, that the loss flowed naturally from the breach of contractual duties or tortuous actions, etc. However it is phrased, the essence of the degree of fault attributed will lie in the fact that reasonable people try to avoid injuring others, so if harm was foreseeable, there should be liability {{to the extent that the}} extent of the harm actually resulting was foreseeable.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{initiatives}} {{sponsored by the}} CJC was the International Jewish Correspondence (IJC). The goal of the IJC was to link Jews {{around the world as}} pen-pals. The organization was founded by Barry Simon in 1978. Simon was a high school maths teacher in Montreal who had been running a general Canadian pen-pal service called Correspondence Canada since 1967. With the rise of the internet in the 1990s, IJC became less active and had folded by 2002. Its letters and administrative files were donated by Simon to the Canadian Jewish Congress Charities Committee National Archives. During its existence, IJC received thousands of letters. The organization also provided addresses for Jews living in Arab and Soviet Bloc countries as well as Jewish prisoners who were put in contact with others <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>situation.</b> The correspondents in the archive range in age from seven-year-old school children to retired persons and came from all walks of life. However, the largest proportion of letters came from high school or college students. The majority of the letters are in English, although other languages are represented including French, Hebrew, Spanish and Yiddish. Jewish people from nearly 20 countries participated in the initiative, including those with declining Jewish populations such as Estonia, Morocco and Zimbabwe.|$|E
25|$|State of the {{opposing}} air forces at {{the outbreak of the}} crisis. The war of 1995 came at a bad moment for the Peruvian Air Force, as the economic crisis that had struck the nation in the 1980s had a negative impact on the readiness of the FAP. At the beginning of January 1995, with a crisis looming on the horizon, the FAP found itself in no shape for a major air war. Most of its fleet of modern Mirage 2000Ps interceptors, bought in the mid-1980s and the backbone of the FAP, was grounded for lack of spare parts and proper maintenance due to lack of funds. Only three Mirage 2000Ps were immediately available for active operations. Its fleet of Sukhoi Su-22 fighter-bombers was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>situation,</b> with some seven aircraft in flying condition; the lack of preparedness even affected the Cessna A-37B subsonic counterinsurgency and ground-attack aircraft. Although by the end of January the situation regarding operational aircraft had greatly improved, the crisis had probably left its impact on the FAP. Ecuador had also passed through a period of economic crisis of its own, but the FAE had kept in operational status a sizeable part of its fleet of Mirage F.1JAs, IAI Kfir C.2s, and SEPECAT Jaguars, with perhaps some ten Mirages, ten Kfirs, and four or six Jaguars in serviceable condition. Thus, while smaller in total number of planes, the FAE of January 1995 felt qualitatively capable of facing the FAP on equal terms - in striking contrast to the situation during the crisis of 1981, where except for a small number of missions, the FAE had been kept on the ground armed and ready for immediate action, to be committed only in case of a full-fledged war. In 1995 their positions in the Cordillera del Cóndor were well defended due to tactically placed SAMs, and units armed with British-made Blowpipe missiles and Russian-made SA-16 MANPADS. Nevertheless, such defences didn´t stop the continuous raids of the Peruvian Air Force, which lost several aircraft in the effort.|$|E

30|$|One {{major reason}} for use of multivariate {{procedures}} for our model is that it keeps Type I error to a minimum (Fan, 1997; Sherry and Henson, 2005; Thompson, 1985, 1991).

CCA is appropriate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>situations</b> where multiple regressions would be but where there are multiple intercorrelated outcome variables.
