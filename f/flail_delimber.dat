40|$|Roadside {{chipping}} is {{a common}} harvesting system to produce chips in Australian plantations. This study investigated the productivity and cost of road-side chipping operation (chipping logs extracted by forwarder to the road side) using a Morbark chipper with <b>flail</b> <b>delimber</b> in a first thinning of Pinus radiata stands. An elemental time study method was used to collect the time working cycles. The regression approach was used to develop the productivity predicting model based on the log size in different wood piles. The statistical analysis yielded an average productivity of 59. 4 GMt/PMH 0 with the corresponding costs of 5. 2 AU$/GMt for the Morbark chipper. The details on work time analysis, relocation time and fuel consumption of the machine are documented in this paper. The results provide basic information for planning roadside chipping operations in pine plantations...|$|E
