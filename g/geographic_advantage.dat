40|$|The {{economic}} geography literature distinguishes between {{two types of}} reasons for economic agglomeration. Regional concentration of economic activity {{can be attributed to}} 'first nature' meaning <b>geographic</b> <b>advantages</b> and disadvantages given by nature or to 'second nature' meaning agglomeration economies by the interaction of economic agents. Several recent studies tried to estimate the relative importance of the two types of explanation. Most of these studies seem to exaggerate the importance of natural advantages because of loose definitions of geography. We describe geography by a small set of non-economic variables and estimate their importance for agglomeration in Germany. We find that about one third of the agglomeration of economic activity can be attributed to geography. ...|$|R
50|$|Three {{years after}} Cao Cao {{defeated}} Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, Cheng Yu recruited and enlisted several thousand robbers and inhabitants of deep hills around Yan Province, {{and led them}} to rendezvous with Cao Cao in Liyang, where Cao Cao {{had set up a}} front line military operation base against Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang. Along with Li Dian, Cheng Yu transported grain to Cao Cao by ships. Once, the supply line was blocked by the Grand Administrator of Wei Commandery, Gao Fan, who capitalized on the <b>geographic</b> <b>advantage.</b> Cao Cao then ordered Cheng Yu to abandon the waterway and transport through other routes. But Li Dian reasoned with Cheng Yu that Gao Fan could be defeated because he was lightly guarded with a small army. Therefore, they violated Cao Cao's order, and landed the northern bank and defeated Gao Fan, resulting in the smooth delivery of military necessities.|$|E
50|$|Renewable {{energy in}} Costa Rica {{supplied}} about 98,1% {{of the energy}} output for the entire nation in 2016. In 2014, 99% of its electrical energy was derived from renewable energy sources, about 80% of which from hydroelectric power. For the first 75 days of 2015, 100% of its electrical energy was derived from renewable energy sources and in mid 2016 that feat was accomplished for 110 consecutive days despite suboptimal weather conditions. As a country, Costa Rica has a <b>geographic</b> <b>advantage</b> over others in that its high concentration per capita of rivers, dams, and volcanoes allow for a high renewable energy output. In addition, Costa Rica is the fourth highest nation in terms of rainfall per capita: it receives an average of 2,926mm of precipitation per year. As a smaller nation {{with a population of}} only 5 million and no major industry, the need for strong energy infrastructure is less than for larger countries of higher population density. The 1948 elimination of the military of Costa Rica freed up millions of dollars from the government defense budget which are now invested in social programs and renewable energy generation. As president of Costa Rica in 1948, José Figueres announced that the nation's former military budget would be refocused specifically in healthcare, education, and environmental protection.|$|E
5000|$|As is well {{documented}} in many studies, rural-urban inequality is a major contributing factor to general income inequality in China. However, “while the contribution of rural-urban inequality {{is much higher than}} that of inland-coastal inequality in terms of levels, the trend is very different. The rural-urban contribution has not changed very much over time, but the inland-coastal contribution has increased by several fold,” meaning that inland-coastal inequality is playing an increasingly important role in the formation of general income inequality across China. A study found that variations across Chinese provinces account for about 12% of the country’s overall income inequality. Research on economic growth after the opening of the Chinese economy has shown that between 1989 and 2004, income in coastal provinces more than tripled whilst that in inland provinces doubled. Research on inland-coastal inequality indicates that [...] "since being a coastal province is a <b>geographic</b> <b>advantage</b> that will persist, this tendency for divergence will also probably continue," [...] but institutional factors still have a significant effect. Economists Ravi Kanbur and Xiao Zhang propose that the “greater ease of rural-to-urban migration within provinces, compared to the institutional and other difficulties of migrating from inland to coastal provinces” can partially explain this phenomenon. “Currently rural incomes are less equally distributed than urban incomes but urban inequality is increasing faster than rural inequality” (Wu, 2005, p. 773).|$|E

5000|$|After {{the death}} of Cao Cao, Wen Ping went on to serve Cao Pi, who ascended the throne and {{formally}} established the state of Cao Wei. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Liu-Sun conflict after Sun Quan captured and executed Guan Yu and seized southern Jing Province, Cao Pi formulated a three-pronged attack on Sun, whose forces were overstretched and diluted. Wen Ping was granted the title of [...] "Marquis of Chang'an" [...] and ordered to assist Zhang He and Cao Zhen on their attack on Jiangling. Like last battle of Jiangling, the Wei forces enjoyed numerical advantage, but this time, they were on the offensive; however, the progress again did not go well because the defenders were determined to fight back, and the siege became a long one. Several months later, enemy reinforcements attempted to get into Jiangling, a branch of Sun Quan's navy entered the Mian River, but Wen Ping was able to hold Miankou (a choke-point of the Mian River) with his warships. Although the attack on Jiangling was canceled when additional enemy relief forces arrived the battlefield, Wen Ping's performance was recognized as he was promoted to [...] "General of the Rear". However, the campaign was not aborted just because they could not seize one city; Wen Ping was ordered to lead his troops to join Cao Pi, who was personally heading toward the city of Stones, which was guarded by Sun Quan's general Xu Sheng. Obscured by heavy fog, Wen Ping and Cao Pi fell victim to Xu Sheng's plot when the latter erected straw figures and flags along the city walls.

For R&D offshoring, we find that it is mainly associated with investment in foreign M&E.
