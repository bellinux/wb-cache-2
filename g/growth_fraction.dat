40|$|SUMMARY. Heparin {{inhibits}} {{the development}} of intimal thickening after carotid injury in the rat; however, the specific cellular events responsible for this effect have not been defined. In this study, smooth muscle cell <b>growth</b> <b>fraction</b> and migration into the intima were quantitatively measured in heparin-treated animals. All rats were subjected to left carotid balloon injury and received continuous intraperitoneal infusion of tritiated thymidine; they were given either heparin or lactated Ringer's solution intravenously for periods of time up to 7 days. Both smooth muscle cell <b>growth</b> <b>fraction</b> and migration of nbndividing smooth muscle cells were markedly reduced in heparin-treated rats. If heparin was administered for only the first 3 days after carotid injury, both smooth muscle <b>growth</b> <b>fraction</b> and migration were reduced at 7 days; on the other hand, heparin {{had no effect on}} <b>growth</b> <b>fraction</b> and migration if given from day 4 to day 7. Finally, heparin given for a period of 1 week produced marked reduction in smooth muscle cell accumulation in injured arteries at 2 and 4 weeks. These results suggest that the effect of heparin on injury-induced intimal thickening might be due to inhibition of both smooth muscle cell entry into the <b>growth</b> <b>fraction</b> and migration of medial smooth muscle cells into the intima. These effects are long lasting, and are not reversed even if heparin is stopped after a short course of administration. (Circ Res 58 : 839 - 845, 1986) THE factors controlling smooth muscle cell (SMC) function in normal, injured, and atherosclerotic ar-tery, although intensively sought for, remain unde-fined. In particular, molecules specifically regulating smooth muscle cell growth are of importance {{from the point of view}} of both vascular wall biology and clinical pharmacology, since no effective means are currently available for preventing or retarding the SMC proliferative aspect of the atherosclerotic proc-ess.

The lesions were 19 acquired melanocytic nevi, 58 primary melanomas [divided into 26 superficial spreading melanomas (SSM), 24 superficial spreading melanomas with nodular areas (SS + NM), and five nodular melanomas (NM) ], and 11 metastases from malignant melanomas.

The more important findings were that CRH mRNA signal intensity in pituitary corticotroph adenoma cells was linearly correlated with Ki- 67 tumor <b>growth</b> <b>fractions</b> (r � 0. 802; P � 0. 0001), and in macroadenoma and locally invasive adenoma cells it {{was significantly higher than}} in microadenoma cells (P � 0. 035).

An interesting phenomenon is described; many more labelled Apr spermatogonia were found compared with the number of labelled As spermatogonia than one would expect in a steady state kinetic system.

Among them, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are known as potent angiogentic factors and mitogens. We evaluated seven cases of grade II brain astrocytoma. Four, group A, was diagnosed as anaplastic progression at their second operation, and three, group B, did not. Using monoclonal antibodies to bFGF and VEGF in paraffin embedded tissue from first operation, their immunoreactivity and differences between two groups were examined. The <b>growth</b> <b>fractions</b> of these tumor were also measured by Ki- 67 monoclonal antibodies (MIB 1). Immunostaining for bFGF in tumor cells were observed in both nuclei and cytoplasm, and for VEGF, mainly observed in the cytoplasm. Mean cell count number +/- standard deviation per high power field in each were as follows: 1) for bFGF, 20. 08 +/- 6. 38 in group A and 0. 87 +/- 0. 90 in group B (P < 0. 01), 2) for VEGF, 43. 75 +/- 17. 09 in group A, and 0. 8 +/- 1. 06 in group B (P < 0. 05) and 3) for the proliferation index with Ki- 67 antibodies, 3. 20 +/- 0. 81 in group A and 0. 77 +/- 1. 03 in group B (P < 0. 05). This data supports the assertion that angiogenetic factor such as bFGF and VEGF may contribute to progressive change of astrocytoma by tumor angiogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Expressions of p 53 protein, {{a product}} of the tumor {{suppressor}} gene were studied in osteosarcomas relating to various prognostic factors. Thirty-four osteosarcomas were investigated immunohistochemically with a monoclonal antibody clone PAb 240, which recognizes a common conformational epitope of mutant p 53 proteins and another clone PAb 1801, which reacts with both wild- and mutant-type p 53 proteins. The results were compared with expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki- 67 providing a simple method for the assessment of <b>growth</b> <b>fractions</b> of tumors. PAb 240 stained nuclei and cytoplasm of tumor cells in 8 of 34 osteosarcomas (23. 5 %), whereas PAb 1801 reacted in all 34 osteosarcomas (100 %). Fifteen tumors (44. 1 %) showed positivity for PAb 1801 in {{more than half of the}} tumor cells. Twelve patients were alive and thirteen were dead. Tumors from 9 patients (75 %) who survived revealed only focal positive immunoreactions with PAb 1801 and tumors from 6 patients (46. 1 %) who died revealed diffuse reactions. Twelve cases (35. 3 %) showed a high PCNA index (> 40 %) and fibroblastic osteosarcomas revealed the highest PCNA positivity. Twenty-two cases (64. 7 %) revealed a very low Ki- 67 index (less than 10 %) and Ki- 67 index showed a good correlation with PCNA positivity (r = 0. 6247). Expressions of both wild-and mutant-type p 53 protein, PCNA, and Ki- 67 were not correlated with other clinical or pathological parameters...|$|R
