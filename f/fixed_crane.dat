5000|$|These ships had {{a unique}} {{appearance}} {{with a pair}} of [...] "horns" [...] jutting out from either side of the bow, each functioning as a <b>fixed</b> <b>crane</b> with a capacity of 22 ST. They were powered by a pair of diesel engines which provided electricity for both propulsion and lifting machinery; there were also two auxiliary diesels and an evaporator for fresh water. Between the [...] "horns" [...] was an opening through which nets could be hauled, bridged by a catwalk.|$|E
50|$|The south quay of {{the dock}} was entirely {{equipped}} for coal export, with seven coal hoists, with capacity of 400 tons per hour. Extensive sidings were built mainly to the south {{of the dock}}, with inbound storage available for 8,000 (loaded) coal wagons, and outbound storage for 3500 wagons. The northwestern arm was initially built as a timber pond, with adjacent rail sidings. Coal hoists were hydraulically powered, supplied by gravity sidings carried across sidings by ferro-concrete bridges built by the Yorkshire Hennebique Contracting Company (Leeds). Six of the hoists were supplied by W.G. Armstrong Whitworth and Company; the seventh, a movable hoist was supplied by Tannet, Walker and Company (Leeds). The north quay of the southwestern arm was used for pig iron handling, and was equipped with ten movable cranes from Armstrong Whitworth of lifting capacity of 5 or 3 tons, and a <b>fixed</b> <b>crane</b> with lifting capacity of up to 50 tons. Further cranes from Cowans, Sheldon and Company (Carlisle) were supplied for the transit sheds.|$|E
50|$|Stothert and Pitt {{supplied}} their earliest electric {{powered crane}} to Southampton Dock Authority in 1892. Electric power provided several advantages: powerful motors {{could be placed}} in each crane and powered centrally, without requiring a separate prime mover (i.e. steam engine and boiler) in each crane. The crane mechanisms were also lighter, allowing them {{to be placed on}} raised carriages that could then straddle a railway freight line- the portal crane. Rather than requiring a bare strip of unused quayside between the railway line and the harbour wall to leave space for cranes, the railway could now be brought right to the dock edge. Cranes were also available immediately, without waiting for boilers to raise steam. Most importantly though (and an advantage over centrally powered hydraulic cranes), electric cranes were now mobile along the dock edge on their own rail lines. Rather than ships queueing for a single berth space alongside a <b>fixed</b> <b>crane,</b> cranes could be brought to each ship's hold hatches as needed. This made a single crane far more efficient, in terms of cargo handled per day. Soon such mobile electric cranes were near universal.|$|E

50|$|A {{jib crane}} {{is a type}} of crane where a {{horizontal}} member (jib or boom), supporting a moveable hoist, is fixed to a wall or to a floor-mounted pillar. Jib cranes are used in industrial premises and on military vehicles. The jib may swing through an arc, to give additional lateral movement, or be <b>fixed.</b> Similar <b>cranes,</b> often known simply as hoists, were fitted {{on the top floor of}} warehouse buildings to enable goods to be lifted to all floors.|$|R
40|$|With current {{construction}} technology of offshore wind turbines, {{there is a}} need for a major marine spread to install the foundation, tower and turbine. There is a clear benefit that offshore installation can be integrated into one operation. The large-scale composite bucket foundation is a basis for the one-step integrated transportation and installation technique with a special vessel. The proposed transportation and installation technique will minimize offshore spread and maximize the proportion of work carried out onshore with consequent benefits in terms of cost, quality and safety. The composite bucket foundation with self-floating property would be towing into a semicircle groove of the vessel and connected with wireropes of the <b>fixed</b> <b>crane.</b> Afterwards, tower and turbine are attached onto the foundation at shore and the whole unit of foundation, tower and turbine is loaded out from the quayside, transported to site and set down on the seabed. During transportation, half of the unit weight is taken by the hoisting system of the vessel and other weight is supported by air cushions inside the composite bucket foundation. A detailed case is studied to determine the motions of the vessel with two units to confirm the viability and feasibility of such a method of the integrated transportation. The transportation and installation methodology are developed to reduce the time spent on offshore works in order to fit the installation work within the time windows with great economic benefits...|$|E
40|$|From this study, {{lift-off}} {{process of}} monopile in single crane vessel scenario and two vessels scenario are all considered. Challenges from environmental conditions and upending process are all cleared. In the single crane vessel scenario, the vessel was assumed as jack-up and floating structures respectively. Different lifting methods were concerned under former assumption, such as constant angular velocity, vertical lifting velocity, vertical lifting forces, <b>fixed</b> <b>crane</b> tip and horizontal moving crane tip. Some suggestions about lift wire force and lifting velocity were listed from these analysis. Regular translation and rotation motions of crane vessel were concerned under latter assumptions. Results of time {{series of three}} concerned forces(lift wire, horizontal and vertical support force) were studied with heave and roll motions of crane vessel. Based on this analysis, vessel motion had little effects to concerned forces compared with upending process. In order to minimize maximum value of three concerned forces, different sea states and upending process were considered. High sea state(means large Hs and Tp) just leaded large standard deviation, which means environmental load was not very important. Then smaller lifting velocity was used to minimize challenge to safety. When the two vessels scenario concerned, distance between transport barge and crane vessel was the main factor. Effects to hydrodynamic factors and ballast due to such distance were cleared. Moreover, time series of lift wire force in this scenario was also got to show critical ste...|$|E
40|$|Forests {{represent}} one of {{the biggest}} terrestrial ecosystems of Earth, that can produce important raw renewable materials such as wood with the help of sun, air and water. To efficiently extract these raw materials, the tree harvesting process is highly mechanized in developed countries, meaning that advanced forestry machines are continuously used to fell, to process and to transport the logs and biomass obtained from the forests. However, working with these machines is demanding both mentally and physically, which are known factors to negatively affect operator productivity. Mental fatigue is mostly due to the manual operation of the on-board knuckleboom crane, which requires advanced cognitive work with two joystick levers, while the most serious physical strains arise from cabin vibrations. These vibrations are generated from knuckleboom crane vibrations as a result of aggressive manual operation. To enhance operator workload, well-being, and to increase productivity of the logging process, semi-automation functions are suggested, which are supervised automatic executions of specific work elements. Some of the related issues are addressed in the current thesis. Therefore, the content is divided into: (1) the design and development of a semi-automation function focused only on the base joint actuator (slewing actuator) of a knuckleboom crane, and (2) active vibration damping solutions to treat crane structure vibrations induced by the main lift cylinder (inner boom actuator). The considered reference machine is a downsized knuckleboom crane of a forwarder machine, which is used to pick up log assortments from a harvesting site. The proposed semi-automation function presented in the first part could be beneficial for operators to use during log loading/unloading scenarios. It consists from a closed-loop position control architecture, to which smooth reference slewing trajectories are provided by a trajectory planner that is automated via operator commands. The used trajectory generation algorithms are taken from conventional robotics and adapted to semi-automation context with proposed modifications that can be customizable by operators. Further, the proposed active vibration damping solutions are aimed to reduce vibrations of the knuckleboom crane excited by the inner boom actuator due to aggressive manual commands. First, a popular input shaping control technique combined with a practical switching logic was investigated to deal with the excited payload oscillations. This technique proved to be useful with a <b>fixed</b> <b>crane</b> pose, however it did not provide much robustness in terms of different link configurations. To tackle this problem an H 2 -optimal controller is developed, which is active in the pressure feedback-loop and its solely purpose is to damp the same payload oscillations. During the design process, operator commands are treated and explained from input disturbance viewpoint. All of the hypothesis throughout this thesis were verified with extensive experimental studies using the reference machine...|$|E
5|$|Chesham {{also had}} {{extensive}} goods facilities, particularly for coal; the goods yard was initially {{equipped with a}} mobile 5-ton crane, replaced by a <b>fixed</b> 8-ton <b>crane</b> between 1898–1900. The outward transport of watercress, a major local industry, also generated significant traffic. During the electrification of the line in 1957–60 the station was equipped with a bay platform for passenger trains, {{to allow it to}} accommodate both through services to and from Baker Street and the Chalfont& Latimer–Chesham shuttle simultaneously. This bay platform was closed on 29 November 1970 and is now a garden.|$|R

It is like <b>fixing</b> a <b>crane</b> on the plain in order to raise the hill tops. In the initiative of the individual above the average, lies the reality of the future, which the State, presenting the average, may subserve but cannot control. And the natural centre of the emotional life, the cardinal will, the supreme and significant expression of individuality, should lie in the selection of a partner for procreation.|$|R

50|$|The port {{opens on}} the western shore of the Strait of Messina, and {{is made up of}} a large inlet of the natural harbour, that borders an area of around 820,000 m². The port areas, however, only occupy about 50 hectares. The harbour {{entrance}} in the northwest is about 400 meters wide, and the average depth of the basin (about 100 meters from the docks) is 40 meters.

40|$|The {{design of}} an {{articulated}} space crane under NASA's 'Pathfinder' program continues to push forward. However, the large size and extreme {{flexibility of the}} crane entail major difficulties in precision positioning. To illustrate this and to gain more insight into its structural dynamic behavior, we have built three-dimensional rigid, flexible, homogenized and non-homogenized finite element models (FEM) of the articulated space crane and simulated its three-dimensional maneuvering. We have also begun to develop control strategies for the flexible system using first a simplified finite element model. The model captures much of the system's low frequency characteristics. From the FEM, a reduced-order model (ROM) based controller is designed based on a specific configuration of the crane. The ROM controller rotates the <b>fixed</b> shape <b>crane</b> about the alpha joint and uses three torque wheels at the tip to actuate its control law. Our analysis of the closed-loop system shows the destabilizing effect of control interaction with unmodeled system dynamics (Controller-Structure-Interaction).

The implementation of the discrete-time control law on the simplified multi-body model is completed using the SAMCEF code...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Static {{stiffness}} of <b>fixed</b> column jib <b>crane</b> directly affected operating and safety performance. Using ANSYS software for {{finite element analysis}} with the consideration of the combined effects of spiral arm and column and the whole structure, the integrated finite element analysis model was established for the whole jib crane and arm-side deflection formula {{for this type of}} crane structure was derived. Results verified the deflection formula and the reasonable camber design for spiral arm. Based on the verification, it is aimed to enhance the degree of static {{stiffness of}} crane, to improve its response to static stiffness of bend arm to set appropriate degree. In particular, arm deflection ensures correct calculation of static stiffness of the crane foundation, but also on the right arm to set an important basis for degree bend...|$|R
50|$|Her {{paintings}} of the Sydney Harbour Bridge as it was being built {{are some of the}} best painted at the turn of the century when it was a symbol of what the people of Australia are capable of. Her first {{paintings of}} the harbour bridge such as The Curve of the Bridge were of the bridge before the actual work on the arms had started, and to disguise this fact she concentrated more on painting the pylons in her earlier {{paintings of the}} bridge. She painted the arches as they were approaching one another, liking the tension between the two sides, and did not paint the bridge after it was completed. Though the painting The Bridge in Curve (1930) was rejected from the Society of Artists exhibition in 1930 it is now considered one of Australia's best modernist paintings. It shows the construction work continuing, with <b>cranes</b> <b>fixed</b> over the edges of both sides of the bridge. Her highly detailed drawn study for the painting shows her eye for details and her ability to capture a scene in a photo-realistic manner. Smith did in fact draw the Harbour Bridge completed in Great White Ship at Circular Quay, but here as the title suggests, the focus is more upon the ship in the foreground than the bridge itself.|$|R
500|$|A {{deck crane}} {{was used for}} the {{construction}} of the main span of the bridge. A specially designed crane of 45tonne capacity was used to erect the pylons of the bridge. The structural steel used in the bridge weighs about 13,200 tonnes. The pylons, which are [...] in height, are designed as free standing portals. They are provided with two cross portal members, one at the bottom and another at the top, below the pylon head. The deck is connected to the end piers by bolts embedded in the chambers of the piers. Pylons made of [...] steel boxes of riveted construction were raised on the two side spans of the bridge; one set is on the Calcutta side and the other is on the Howrah side. The six pylons on the Calcutta side of the bridge were installed using 75 MT and 50 MT cranes, while on the Howrah end, a single 50 MT crane was used. Anchorage of the pylon with the base of piers was effected through Dywidag rods, duly anchored in the piers. Cables were erected from the four pylon heads with the help of 32 MT hoist frames. The hoist frames were mounted on top of each pylon. Sheave blocks, winches and snatch blocks were used to facilitate the lifting, and cables inside the pylons were stressed with jacks. Pressure grouting was performed to fill the voids between the wire and the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes.

40|$|A remoção de plantas aquáticas tem sido utilizada como opção ao controle químico e biológico, em razão de restrições ambientais em algumas regiões brasileiras. O objetivo deste trabalho foi desenvolver um modelo para análise econômica e operacional da remoção mecânica de plantas aquáticas, visando realizar estudo econômico comparativo com o controle químico. A operação foi estudada num reservatório de uma usina de bombeamento em Barra do Piraí-RJ. O sistema {{consiste}} de retroescavadeiras instaladas em balsas, usadas para cortar as plantas e liberá-las no fluxo de água. Antes da tomada d'água existe uma barreira flutuante que intercepta as plantas, as quais são removidas por um guindaste fixo nas margens. As plantas são armazenadas por algum tempo e depois descartadas. Existe, ainda, um sistema de limpeza das grades da tomada d'água. Dados do volume total de plantas descartadas foram coletados durante 14 meses, assim como foi avaliado o volume de biomassa produzido por área das principais espécies infestantes. A empreiteira que administra o serviço forneceu planilhas de custos e outro parâmetros operacionais. Um modelo foi desenvolvido para calcular custos por hectare de plantas removidas. Os resultados mostraram custo médio mensal de US$ 17. 780, 28 por hectare. Apesar do alto custo, o sistema de remoção demonstrou capacidade de controlar apenas 4, 1 % da área infestada no reservatório, na época da coleta dos dados. Simulando dados de uma aplicação de glyphosate, o controle químico custaria apenas 0, 23 % do custo da remoção. Análises de sensibilidade mostraram que a compactação das plantas para transporte, o volume de plantas produzidas por área e o custo do transporte são os parâmetros principais para a otimização. Mechanical {{removal of}} aquatic weeds {{has been an}} option to biological and chemical control because of environmental restrictions in some places in Brazil. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a model for economic and operational analysis of a mechanical removal system for aquatic weeds, aiming a comparative study related to chemical control. The operation was studied in a reservoir linked to a pumping plant in Barra do Piraí-RJ, Brazil. The system consists of some cranes floating on rafts used to cut weeds and release them into the water flow. Before the suction intake there is a floating barrier to trap the weeds, which are removed from the reservoir by another <b>crane,</b> <b>fixed</b> on the embankment. Weeds are stored for some time and then transported to a disposal place. In addition, there is a fence to protect the suction intake from weeds that passed through the barrier and a mechanical system to clean up the fence. Data related to the total volume of weeds transported to the disposal place were collected for 14 months, and the volume produced per square meter of infestation for the major weeds was assessed. The company in charge of the system provided costs and other operational parameters, developing a model based on operational and cost parameters to calculate the total cost per hectare of weeds removed. The results showed an average monthly cost of US$ 17, 780. 28 per hectare of weeds removed. Despite the high costs, the system was able to control only 4. 1 % of the infested area in the reservoir at the time data was collected. Using simulated data for glyphosate application, chemical control would cost only 0. 23 % of the mechanical removal cost. The Sensitivity analyses showed that the compaction of the weeds for transportation, the volume of weeds produced per area and the cost of transportation are major parameters for the optimization of the system...|$|R
