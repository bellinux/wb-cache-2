5000|$|The {{trail was}} a main supply route for gold camps {{and created a}} lucrative trading network during {{the spring and summer}} months, {{generating}} a fierce competition between several entrepreneurs. One of these entrepreneurs was Benjamin Holladay. A stagecoach magnate, he lowered freight rates until the competition was driven out and then raised them to new heights He was able to drive out the competition by gaining a government subsidy to carry mail. When he realized that trains would drive out his business, he sold his company to Wells, Fargo & Company, which provided a flow of goods, carried passengers, and continued delivering the mail until the Union Central and Pacific Railroad Lines came into the picture. [...] Transporting mail provided most of the company’s profit, which made wagon leaders care more about the mail than their passengers, even though the company charged passengers around $150 for the <b>journey.</b> <b>Stage</b> coach companies also carried the mail and transported people to new towns in Montana. [...] Bandits, bad weather and accidents did not stop the flow of goods during the 8 months of the year the trail was opened. [...] Although bandits infested the road and scared the travelers, only blizzards stopped the flow of goods when snow covered Monida Pass.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} active travel (walking or cycling) in Scotland and explore potential demographic, geographic, and socio-economic inequalities in active travel. We extracted {{data for the}} period 2012 – 13 (39, 585 journey stages) from the Scottish Household Survey. Survey travel diaries recorded all journeys made on the previous day by sampled individuals aged 16 + living within Scotland, and the stages within each journey. Descriptive statistics were calculated for journey stages, mode, purpose and distance. Logistic regression models were fitted {{to examine the relationship}} between the likelihood of a <b>journey</b> <b>stage</b> being active, age, sex, area deprivation and urban/rural classification. A quarter of all journey stages were walked or cycled (26 %, n: 10, 280 / 39, 585); 96 % of these were walked. Those living in the least deprived areas travelled a greater average distance per active <b>journey</b> <b>stage</b> than those in the most deprived. The likelihood of an active <b>journey</b> <b>stage</b> was higher for those living in the most deprived areas than for those in the least deprived (Odds Ratio (OR) 1. 21, 95 % CI 1. 04 – 1. 41) and for those in younger compared to older age groups (OR 0. 44, 95 % CI 0. 34 – 0. 58). In conclusion, socio-economic inequalities in active travel were identified, but – contrary to the trends for many health-beneficial behaviours – with a greater likelihood of active travel in more deprived areas. This indicates a potential contribution to protecting and improving health for those whose health status tends to be worse. Walking was the most common mode of active travel, and should be promoted as much as cycling...|$|E

40|$|Background: Promoting active {{travel is}} an {{important}} part of increasing population physical activity, which has both physical and mental health benefits. A key benefit described by the then Scottish Government of the five-mile M 74 motorway extension, which opened during June 2011 in the south of Glasgow, was that the forecast reduction in motor traffic on local streets would make these streets safer for walking and cycling, thus increasing active travel by the local population. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of new motorway infrastructure on the proportion of journey stages made actively (cycling or on foot) by individuals travelling in and out of the local area. Methods: Data for the periods 2009 – 10 and 2012 – 13 were extracted from the Scottish Household Survey (SHS) travel diaries, which record each <b>journey</b> <b>stage</b> made during the previous day by a representative sample of the Scottish population aged 16 and over. Each individual <b>journey</b> <b>stage</b> was assigned to one of the following study areas surrounding existing and new transport infrastructure: (1) an area surrounding the new M 74 motorway extension (n[*]=[*] 435 (2009 – 10), 543 (2012 – 13)), (2) a comparator area surrounding an existing motorway (n[*]=[*] 477 (2009 – 10), 560 (2012 – 13)), and (3) a control area containing no comparable motorway infrastructure (n[*]=[*] 541 (2009 – 10), 593 (2012 – 13)). Multivariable, multi-level regression analysis was performed to determine any between-area differences in change in active travel over time, which might indicate an intervention effect. Reference populations were defined using two alternative definitions, (1) Glasgow City and (2) Glasgow and surrounding local authorities. Results: The results showed an increase in the proportion of journey stages using active travel in all study areas compared to both reference populations. However, there were no significant between-area differences to suggest an effect attributable the M 74 motorway extension. Conclusions: There was no clear evidence that the M 74 motorway extension either increased or decreased active travel in the local area. The anticipation by policy makers that reduced motorised traffic on local streets might increase journeys walked or cycled appears to have been unfounded...|$|E
40|$|Improvement {{of chain}} {{mobility}} {{is considered a}} major issue in public transport use. Transfers within a public transport trip are the least appreciated part of the trip. This research quantifies the experienced transfer disutility of a transfer between BTM and train. The influence of travel time, transfer time, headway, costs and station facilities on the valuation of a transfer is estimated, based on a web-based stated preference (SP) experiment with over 1145 respondents. A set of mixed logit models was estimated, including sub-models by trip purpose, travel frequency, access/egress mode and <b>journey</b> <b>stage</b> (access or egress). The modeling results show that the total disutility during the interchange depends on the total time, the distribution of the time spent (access, transfer, waiting time) and headway. In general, the most optimal transfer time is found to be 8 min, but relevant differences are found among respondents and stations. The highlighted preferences of different groups of travelers can be used by public transport service to meet the travelers' needs in a transfer, and decrease the transfer disutility...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the emerging literature on the application of smart card fare payment data to public transportation planning. The research objective is to identify and assess complete, multimodal journeys using Oyster smart card fare payment data in London. Three transfer combinations (bus-to-Underground, Underground-to-bus, and bus-to-bus) are considered to formulate recommendations for maximum elapsed time thresholds to identify transfers between <b>journey</b> <b>stages</b> for each passenger on the London network. Recommended elapsed time thresholds for identifying transfers are 20 min for Underground-to-bus, 35 min for bus-to-Underground, and 45 min for bus-to-bus, but a range of values that account for variability across the network are also assessed. Key findings about bus and Underground travel in London include an average of 2. 3 daily public transportation journeys per passenger, 1. 3 <b>journey</b> <b>stages</b> per public transportation journey, and 23 % of Underground journeys involving a transfer to or from a bus.

40|$|This {{theoretical}} paper examines possible therapeutic intersections {{between the}} hero’s journey as outlined by Leeming (1998) and Landy’s (2009) role theory {{with the aim}} of serving Canadian male veterans living with combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (CR-PTSD). The story of the hero’s journey is not new to drama therapy. Both Landy (1993) and Silverman (2004) cited it as influencing their work, however, this research synthesizes elements from both of them. Specifically, Leeming’s hero’s <b>journey</b> <b>stages</b> provide a similar therapeutic framework to that of Silverman’s (2004) The Story Within. The theoretical analysis portion of this research uses literature on CR-PTSD to support connections between Leeming’s hero’s <b>journey</b> <b>stages</b> and implementation of Landy’s role and counterrole using roles taken from the Role Profiles card sort (Landy & Butler, 2012) in one analysis. The purpose of this theoretical analysis is to examine the potential of combining Leeming’s stages with Landy’s concepts of role and counterrole through dramatic exploration of archetypal roles. The analysis suggests that combining these three frameworks could potentially foster positive therapeutic outcomes for veterans by creating opportunities for them to find meaning in their experiences of living with PTSD. However, the nature of using them together is highly adaptable, flexible and not restricted to the theoretical arguments contained in this analysis. Strengths and limitations of this research are discussed, and recommendations for future research are addressed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{contributes to}} an emerging {{body of literature}} on the application of smart card data to public transportation planning. It also addresses interchange planning, {{a key component of}} public transportation network planning that has lately received renewed interest as evidenced by planning literature on integrated and intermodal networks. The research objective of assessing the potential application of smart card data to bus network planning is met, first, by a review of existing data systems and the bus network planning approach at Transport for London (TfL). Then, three potential interchange combinations: bus-to underground, Underground-to-bus, and bus-to-bus are examined to gain an understanding of interchange behavior in London and to formulate recommendations for elapsed time thresholds to identify interchanges between journey stages for each passenger on the TfL network. Other TfL data are compared with the results of linking journey stages into complete journeys based on these elapsed time thresholds. Finally, the complete journey data are applied to bus network planning case studies that illustrate the value of new contextual and quantitative information that would be available to network planners using smart card data without necessitating additional data from other sources such as Automated Vehicle Locators or Automated Passenger Counters. (cont) Recommended elapsed time thresholds for identifying interchanges across the London network are: 20 minutes for Underground-to-bus interchanges, 35 minutes for bus-to underground interchanges, and 45 minutes for bus-to-bus interchanges, but a range of values that account for variability across the network are provided. Key findings about intermodal travel behavior in London include evidence of complex bus travel patterns during the Midday and PM Peak time periods and of land uses near Underground stations influencing interchange behavior. Moreover, complete journey data result in approximately 2. 3 daily public transportation journeys per passenger, 1. 3 journey stages per public transportation journey, and 25 percent of Underground journeys including a linked bus <b>journey</b> <b>stage.</b> Finally, examples of new contextual information for bus network planning include connectivity of bus routes, intermodality of bus journeys, duration of bus access journeys, and duration of Underground to-bus interchanges. New quantitative information about the number of passengers transferring between two bus routes can be used in cost-benefit analyses of service changes to the bus network. by Catherine Whitney Seaborn.

40|$|Public {{transport}} {{agencies have}} used manual surveys to collect demographic and travel diary information {{in order to}} understand their customers' travel behavior for many years. Recently many agencies have also begun to use automated sources of data from fare collection, vehicle location, and passenger counting systems to improve the understanding of their customers' detailed geographic and temporal travel behavior as well as frequency of usage, and travel pattern variation at a much larger scale than is possible with manually collected survey data. Transport for London (TfL), the public body responsible for all transportation services in London, was chosen as a case study to determine how and to what extent automatic fare card (Oyster) data can be used to enhance and validate the London Travel Demand Survey (LTDS) single day travel diary responses. This thesis found that combining survey responses with linked Oyster data for specific households could greatly enhance the validity of the single travel day and improve the understanding of the variability of weekly public transport (PT) use. However, it was difficult to match the survey diary responses and Oyster card records after the interview had taken place. This was evidenced by the fact that only 51. 1 % of Oyster <b>journey</b> <b>stages</b> had matching survey <b>journey</b> <b>stages,</b> only 45. 6 % of survey stages had matching Oyster stages, and only 44 % of the sample had perfectly matching survey and Oyster stages. Even when there were matches, there were large differences in many journey start times and durations with an average start time difference of 61. 2 minutes. This suggests that it would be advantageous to integrate the Oyster records earlier in the survey process, using some type of prompted recall methods with Oyster records in the near term, and new location tracking smart phone applications in the future. Analysis of the weekly variation in PT travel found that the single day survey overestimates typical PT use overall, but it underestimates the intensity of PT use on days when the survey sample chose to use the PT mode. Additionally, the reported frequency of PT use in the LTDS was significantly higher than the actual use as captured by the Oyster system, and therefore the LTDS is generally overestimating the PT use overall for London residents. by Laura K.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{school journey}} is often studied in {{relation}} to health outcomes in children and adolescents. Self-report {{is the most common}} measurement tool. PurposeTo investigate the error on self-reported journey duration in adolescents, using a wearable digital camera (Microsoft SenseCam). MethodsDuring March–May 2011, participants (n= 17; aged 13 – 15 years) from four schools wore wearable cameras to and from school for 1 week. The device automatically records time-stamped, first-person point-of-view images, without any action from the wearer. Participants also completed a researcher-administered self-report travel survey over the same period. Analysis took place in November 2011. Within- and between-subjects correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman 95 % limits of agreement were derived, accounting for the multiple observations per individual. ResultsSelf-report data were collected for 150 <b>journey</b> <b>stages</b> and SenseCam data for 135 (90 %) of these. The within-subjects correlation coefficient for journey duration was 0. 89 (95 % CI= 0. 84, 0. 93). The between-subjects correlation coefficient was 0. 92 (95 % CI= 0. 79, 0. 97). The mean difference (bias) between methods at the whole sample level was small (10 seconds per journey, 95 % CI= − 33, 53). The wide limits of agreement (± 501 seconds, 95 % CI= − 491, 511) reveal large random error.

30|$|A {{comprehensive}} approach to measuring public transport accessibility however introduces a number of complexities. Firstly, not only accessibility to locations via public transport but also access to public transport by different modes has to be dealt with. This ideally implies a multimodal modelling approach including all possible transport modes, inclusion of public transport schedules, demand and supply interactions and adequate networks. For example, if Park-and-Ride is available, car choice should be included as access mode. In the transport modelling literature, the integration of road and public transport networks in an integrated multi-modal network (‘super-network’) model is receiving increasing attention [e.g., see 12 – 14]. Secondly, travellers perceive different parts of a public transport <b>journey</b> <b>stages</b> differently, such as the time spent in feeder modes, waiting and transfer times at public transport stops and in-vehicle travel time [15, 16]. Travel time savings are also perceived differently between bicycle and local public transport feeder modes [17]. Therefore, specific penalties need to be assigned in the estimation of transport impedances to each access/egress mode in a multimodal trip. Those penalties can represent perceived impedance factors such as smoothness and convenience of the access/egress combinations. Moreover, the perceived quality of stations might also {{have an impact on}} those penalties, passengers would be more prone to wait [18, 19] or travel further to access more attractive stations [20].|$|R
