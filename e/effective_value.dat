60|$|The {{series of}} {{engravings}} thus completed, while they present no characters {{on which the}} members of the Arundel Society can justifiably pride themselves, have, nevertheless, a real and <b>effective</b> <b>value,</b> if considered as a series of maps of the Arena frescoes. Few artists of eminence pass through Padua without making studies of detached portions of the decoration of this Chapel, while no artist has time to complete drawings of the whole. Such fragmentary studies might now at any time be engraved with advantage, their place in the series being at once determinable by reference to the woodcuts; while qualities of expression could often be obtained in engravings of single figures, which are sure to be lost in an entire subject. The most refined character is occasionally dependent on a few happy and light touches, which, in a single head, are effective, but are too feeble to bear due part in an entire composition, while, in the endeavour to reinforce them, their vitality is lost. I believe {{the members of the}} Arundel Society will perceive, eventually, that no copies of works of great art are worthily representative of them but such as are made freely, and for their own purposes, by great painters: the best results obtainable by mechanical effort will only be charts or plans of pictures, not mirrors of them. Such charts it is well to command in as great number as possible, and with all attainable completeness; but the Society cannot be considered as having entered on its true functions until it has obtained the hearty co-operation of European artists, and by the increase of its members, the further power of representing the subtle studies of masterly painters by the aid of exquisite engraving.|$|E
60|$|The nutritive Elements of Food.--Many chemists {{have applied}} {{themselves}} in recent years, {{to discover the}} exact percentage of nutriment contained in different substances, and to determine the minimum nutriment on which human life can be supported. The results are not very accordant, but nevertheless a considerable approximation to truth has been arrived at. It is now possible to tell whether a proposed diet has any great faults of excess or deficiency, and how to remedy those faults. But it also must be recollected that the stomach is an assimilating machine of limited performance, and must be fed with food that it can digest; {{it is not enough}} that the food should contain nutritious matter, if that matter should be in an indigestible form. Burke and Wills perished from sheer inability to digest the seeds upon which the Australian savages lived; and Gardiner's party died of starvation in Tierra del Fuego, because they could not digest the shell-fish which form a common article of diet of the natives of that country. The question of diet must then be limited to food that is perfectly digestible by the traveller. It remains to learn how much nourishment is contained in different kinds of digestible food. Dr. Smith has recently written an elaborate essay on this subject, applying his inquiries chiefly to the food of the poor in England; but for my more general purpose, as it is impossible to do justice to a large and imperfectly understood subject, in the small space I can give to it, it will be better that I should reprint the results given in my previous edition. These are principally extracted from a remarkable paper by Dr. Christison, inserted in the Bluebook Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Crimean matters, in which the then faulty dietary of our soldiers was discussed. It appears 1st, that a man of sedentary life can exist in health on seventeen ounces per day of real nutriment; that a man engaged in active life requires fully twenty-eight ounces per day; and, during severe labour, he requires thirty ounces, or even more. 2ndly, that this nutriment must consist of three-quarters, by weight, of one class of nutritive principles, (C), and one quarter of another class of nutritive principles, (N); 3rdly, that all the articles of common food admit of being placed, as below, in a Table, by which we see at a glance how much nutriment of class C, and how much of class N, is found in 100 parts, gross weight of any of them. Thus, by a simple computation, the <b>effective</b> <b>value</b> of a dietary may be ascertained. Class C, are the carboniferous principles, that maintain respiration; Class N, are the nitrogenous principles, that repair waste of tissue. N will partly replace C, but at a great waste: C will not replace N.|$|E

40|$|Singular value {{decomposition}} (SVD) is {{a widely}} used and powerful tool for signal extraction under noise. Noise attenuation relies on {{the selection of the}} <b>effective</b> singular <b>value</b> because these values are significant features of the useful signal. Traditional methods of selecting <b>effective</b> singular <b>values</b> (or selecting the useful components to rebuild the faulty signal) consist of seeking the maximum peak of the differential spectrum of singular values. However, owing to the small number of selected <b>effective</b> singular <b>values,</b> these methods lead to excessive de-noised effects. In order to get a more appropriate number of <b>effective</b> singular <b>values,</b> which preserves the components of the original signal as much as possible, this paper used a difference curvature spectrum of incremental singular entropy to determine the number of <b>effective</b> singular <b>values.</b> Then the position was found where the difference of two peaks in the spectrum declines in an infinitely large degree for the first time, and this position was regarded as the boundary of singular values between noise and a useful signal.

In this paper some results of 3 D-finite element analyses of a CTS-specimen with a tortuous crack are presented. The specimen is subject to an in-plane shear remote loading (mode II) and tortuous crack flanks simulate rough cracks in polycrystalline materials. Finite element calculation by using the commercially available FE-code ANSYS has been carried out to determine stress/strain distribution in the vicinity of crack front and the local values of stress intensity factors are evaluated along the crack front. The existence of friction forces generated by sliding of crack wake asperities is included into calculations.

The treatment of spectra, performed using the GUPIX code, requires the determination of an instrumental constant H. In theory and when using ordinary filters, H is a constant corresponding to the detection solid angle. In contrast, we have observed that H varies with X-ray energy using a funny filter. This is due to an inaccurate description of the geometry of the detection: detector-to-target distance, filter thicknesses and hole diameter of the funny filter.
