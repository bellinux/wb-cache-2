5|$|Throughout 1993, Carey began conceptualizing Music Box (1993), {{which became}} the highest selling album of Carey's career. For her past two albums, Carey's {{creative}} choices were heavily controlled by her label Columbia Records, {{as well as her}} husband and CEO of the company, Tommy Mottola. Carey's previous effort, Emotions (1991), drew influence from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry, gospel, R and soul music, and failed to achieve the same success matched by her debut album. Following its tepid commercial performance, Columbia aimed for Music Box to be a vehicle for very commercial singles that could garner strong radio airplay. The album was formed as a pop record, and more mainstream than anything on Emotions. Music Box went on to sell over 32 million copies worldwide, and <b>earned</b> <b>its</b> <b>place</b> among the best-selling albums of all time. Due to the album's success, Columbia allowed Carey more control over the music she recorded for Daydream (1995).|$|E

2500|$|Algeria's {{representative}} {{in the debates}} submitted that {{to recognize that the}} government of the People's Republic of China was lawfully entitled to represent China did not imply the eviction of a member but the eviction of the representatives of a dissident minority regime. The U.S. in its submission took the opposite view, arguing that adoption of the resolution expelling the representatives sent from Taipei would imply the termination of the membership of a longstanding member. The spokesman of the Republic of China submitted that his country had <b>earned</b> <b>its</b> <b>place</b> in the United Nations by virtue of its contribution to peace and freedom during the Second World War. He said the Chinese communist regime, which had [...] never had the moral consent of the Chinese people, could in no way be regarded as the representative of the great Chinese nation. Various members including two permanent members of the security council, the United Kingdom and the USSR, argued that requiring the matter to be subject to a supermajority vote was not appropriate because the adoption of the Albanian proposed resolution did not involve the admission or expulsion of a member. Rather it concerned only credentials and Taiwan had never been a member. They argued there was only one Chinese state that was a member. Any other Chinese state would have to apply for membership in accordance with the Charter.|$|E
