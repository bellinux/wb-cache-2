The Knights of the Grail passionately urge Amfortas to uncover the Grail again but Amfortas, in a frenzy, says he will never again show the Grail.

At this moment, Parsifal steps forth and says that only one weapon can heal the wound (""). He touches Amfortas' side with the Spear and both heals and absolves him.

5|$|Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) tells Aden that {{he should}} behave in a manner his {{grandfather}} would be proud of. This upsets Aden, and he tries to cause trouble at school. When Cassie discovers she has HIV, Aden becomes irate at the prospect {{that she may have}} infected him in the car accident. After his tests come back negative, <b>he</b> <b>cries</b> in disappointment. His doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews), suggests that Aden may need counselling, but he refuses. When Aden's alcoholic father Larry throws him out, he is taken in by his friend Roman. Aden is upset to learn that Roman was in the army like his grandfather, and visits the structurally damaged local diner to be alone. The ceiling collapses and Aden is seriously injured. In the aftermath, Larry tells Rachel that Aden was abused by his grandfather as a child. Aden cannot face going home, so moves in with Roman more permanently. He is attracted to Roman's daughter Nicole, but does not pursue her out of respect for Roman. Instead, Aden kisses Belle, but deflects her attempts to take things further. She goes on a date with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz), which prompts a jealous Aden to admit that he could not sleep with her because of the abuse he suffered as a child. When Larry injures himself while drunk, he is found by his son, and admits that Aden's grandfather also abused him. Aden holds Larry, Rachel and Belle hostage so that his father cannot receive medical assistance, but they are rescued by Angelo. Aden is forced into counselling, and begins {{to come to terms with}} his abuse.|$|E

25|$|A crowd mills {{about before}} the Cathedral of the Intercession (the Temple of Vasiliy the Blessed) in Red Square. Many are beggars, and policemen {{occasionally}} appear. A {{group of men}} enters, discussing the anathema the deacon had declared on Grishka (Grigoriy) Otrepyev in the mass. They identify Grishka as the Tsarevich. With growing excitement they sing of the advance of his forces to Kromï, of his intent to retake his father's throne, and of the defeat he will deal to the Godunovs. A yuródivïy enters, pursued by urchins. He sings a nonsensical song ("The moon is flying, the kitten is crying"). The urchins greet him and rap on his metal hat. The yuródivïy has a kopek, which the urchins promptly steal. He whines pathetically. Boris and his retinue exit the Cathedral. The boyars distribute alms. In a powerful chorus ("Benefactor father... Give us bread!"), the hungry people beg for bread. As the chorus subsides, the yuródivïy's cries are heard. Boris asks why <b>he</b> <b>cries.</b> The yuródivïy reports the theft of his kopek and asks Boris to order the boys' slaughter, {{just as he did}} {{in the case of the}} Tsarevich. Shuysky wants the yuródivïy seized, but Boris instead asks for the holy man's prayers. As Boris exits, the yuródivïy declares that the Mother of God will not allow him to pray for Tsar Herod (see Massacre of the Innocents). The yuródivïy then sings his lament ("Flow, flow, bitter tears!") about the fate of Russia.|$|E

500|$|Using a five- to eight-note range, Orbison's voice rises as {{he wakes}} up to find his lover gone. The song trips; the music stops and a staccato tattoo replaces it, as <b>he</b> <b>cries</b> when remembering she has left him. The climax is a {{powerful}} crescendo as <b>he</b> <b>cries</b> [...] "It's too bad that all these things / Can only happen in my dreams", and the resolution follows his voice from falsetto to the final note an octave below as he sings [...] "Only in dreams / In beautiful dreams", as all the instruments and singers conclude with him abruptly. The song never repeats a section. In two minutes and forty-eight seconds, it goes through seven movements with distinct melodies and chord progressions. The first two sections are sixteen bars each; the rest are only eight bars. In comparison to the standard form of pop songs in AABA — where A represents a standard verse, and B represents a variation, usually {{referred to as the}} bridge — [...] "In Dreams", with each variation, can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F.|$|E

Coach Beiste breaks up the fight; in the locker room, Puck tells her that the knife is a fake stage prop, and she retorts {{that he could have}} gotten expelled. Puck replies that he is flunking out anyway and a failure, telling her that she does not {{know what it feels like}} to be worthless.

500|$|... "Savior's Shadow" [...] {{was written}} by Shelton, Alexander, and Randall, while {{production}} was handled by longtime collaborator Scott Hendricks. It is composed in the key of D major using common time with a tempo of 96-100 beats per minute. His vocal range, which spanned from A3-E5, {{was accompanied by a}} piano, in addition to backup vocals. An [...] "introspective" [...] gospel song, it serves as [...] "a guide" [...] to demonstrate his faith [...] "through trying times". The gospel section and string arrangements was imagined by Charlie Judge, while Russ Pahl helped Shelton in creating [...] "bittersweet steel notes" [...] for the production. Shelton sings: [...] "I feel the rain, I hear the thunder / As <b>He</b> <b>cries</b> for me", demonstrating that Jesus was [...] "a powerful source of strength" [...] for the singer. The first verse displays Shelton's [...] "longing and willingness to stand" [...] with Jesus after his relationship struggles: [...] "Though the devil tried to break me / My sweet Jesus won't forsake me / When I'm in my Savior's shadow where I'm supposed to be". Jeff Nelson of People claimed that the single offered some of Shelton's [...] "most revealing lyrics", particularly the aforementioned lines.

500|$|Scogin's introspective lyrics {{have covered}} topics like materialism, death, and the Nashville Christian music industry. The lyrics for Wars and Rumors of Wars were formed after a family loss: [...] "...only {{a year ago}} my father passed away. And I hate to say this, because it sounds like such a band-dude thing to say, but the lyrics are a lot darker than any other record just because of how {{personal}} they are for me." [...] Scogin usually refers to his lyrics as poems and has maintained that [...] "a song is never finished but abandoned." [...] "...as an artist you can forever be changing a song or making a song 'better' or whatever but the moment that you stop recording and send it off to be mastered you have not 'finished' the song…you have only abandoned the song {{and that is how}} it will stay forever." [...] His lyrics sometimes espouse Christian themes and beliefs, albeit subtly. For example, the track [...] "Yellow Dress: Locked Knees" [...] from Everything... contains the Spanish lyrics [...] "Jesus, yo quiero que este mundo te conozca."; when translated, it says [...] "Jesus, I want this world to know You." [...] The song [...] "And Shot Each Other" [...] from The Fiancée fades out into a Sacred Harp choir singing the song 'Child of Grace', which features the lyrics [...] "How happy is a child of grace, who feels his sins forgiven / This world, <b>he</b> <b>cries,</b> is not my place / I seek a place in Heaven." ...|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} generally positive reviews from most music critics. Sam Lanksy of Idolator gave the song a favorable review, calling it [...] "an emotional ballad that shows off Mars’ sweet vocals." [...] Lansky also praised it, naming it [...] "another exceptional offering from Unorthodox Jukebox, which {{is shaping up}} {{to be one of the}} year’s best pop releases." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust gave the song a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting that 'When I Was Your Man' is [...] "a much more satisfying, less ostentatious ballad than 'Young Girls'— though maybe the lyrics are a little too clichéd to result in a classic soul ballad the way Bruno seems to be going for." [...] However, he praised Mars, which according to him, [...] "nobody puts a song like this over quite like him, and when he hits the big high note on the song’s bridge, it’s about as striking a moment as you’re likely to hear on a pop record this year. It might be a little too perfect to be as devastating as a song like 'Someone Like You', but it might be a big hit just the same, and it’s guaranteed to absolutely slay in a live set." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was positive, writing that [...] "Old-school charm still gets Mars the furthest, and the best thing here is the classic torch song 'When I Was Your Man', which finds him at the piano listing all the ways he wronged an ex. 'Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life,' <b>he</b> <b>cries</b> in his Sinatra-smooth tenor, oozing charm. Maybe he's a jerk. But he's the jerk that girl's going home with tonight." ...|$|E
