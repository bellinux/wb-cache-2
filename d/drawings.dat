5|$|Leonardo's {{anatomical}} <b>drawings</b> {{include many}} {{studies of the}} human skeleton and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it {{in a manner that}} prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. He drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific <b>drawings</b> of a fetus in utero. The <b>drawings</b> and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.|$|E
40|$|THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE NATURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN'S <b>DRAWING</b> ABILITY DURING THE PRE - SCHOOL AND SCHOOL AGE, IN TERMS OF THE THEORY OF EXPERIMENTIAL STRUCTURALISM (DEMETRIOU & EFKLIDES 1989). MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PRESENT RESEARCH WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE FOUR CRITICAL QUESTIONS : 1) COULD THE <b>DRAWING</b> ABILITY BE CHARACTERIZED AS A SPECIALISED COGNITIVEABILITY (SSS) IN THE ORGANISATION OF THE MIND ? 2) WHAT STRUCTURAL RELATIONS ARETHERE, BETWEEN THE <b>DRAWING</b> ABILITY, THE RES T OF THE SPECIALISED COGNITIVEABILITIES AND THE PROCESSING SYSTEM ? 3) WHAT IS THE DEVELOPMENTAL PROFILE OF THE <b>DRAWING</b> ABILITY AND WHETHER IS RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT OF THE REST OF THE SSS'S AND THE PROCESSING SYSTEM ? 4) WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE <b>DRAWING</b> ABILITY ?THE ABOVE QUESTIONS WERE INVESTIGATED IN A SAMPLE OF 140 BOYS AND GIRLSAGED 4 AND 10 YEARS. COGNITIVE AND <b>DRAWING</b> TASKS WERE DEVELOPED AND APPLIED,TESTING FOR THE QUALITATIVE, CAUSAL AND SPATIAL SSS RESPECTIVELY AS WELL ASTASKS THAT INVESTI GATED CHILDRENS' SHORT - TERM STORAGE. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE ABILITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR THE DEPICTION OF REALITY ARE ORGANISEDIN AN AUTONOMOUS SPHERE AND THEREFORE COULD BE REGARDED AS AN INDEPENDENT SSS IN THE ORGANISATION OF THE MIND. AS REGARDS THE STRUCTURAL RELATIONS BETWEEN <b>DRAWING</b> ABILITY AND THE OTHER SSS'S, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE FORMER IS STRUCTURALLY RELATED MORE TO THE QUALITATIVE SSS. WITH VIEW TO THE RELATIONS TO THEPROCESSING SYSTEM, THE FINDINGS REVEALED DIFFERENT WAYS OF CONNECTIO N BETWEEN <b>DRAWING</b> ABILITY AND THE TWO MNEMONIC SUBSYSTEMS T...|$|R

40|$|THE STUDY INVESTIGATED THREE GUESTIONS: (1) WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MENTAL IMAGERY AND <b>DRAWING</b> EFFICIENCY. (2) HOW DOES <b>DRAWING</b> EFFICIENCY AFFECT MANIPULATION OF CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT CONCERTS. (3) WHICH SYMBOLIC SYSTEMS ARE IN THE CONSTUCTION OF MENTAL IMAGES OF CONCEPTS. THE RESEARCH WAS CARRIED IN TWO PHASES. IN THE FIRST A TOTAL OF 167 SUBJECTS (AGED 10 - 17) WAS TESTED IN GROUPS WITH ADDRESSED TO THEIR MENTAL IMAGERY ABILITY TO METACOGNITIVE AND TO <b>DRAWING</b> EFFICIENCY. IN THE SECOND PHASE A TOTAL OF 68 SUBJECTS, SELECTED ACCORDING TO THEIR <b>DRAWING</b> SCOVES (HIGH-LOW), WAS TESTED (INDIVIDUALLY) WITH TASKSADDRESSED TO THE MANIPNLATION OF VERBAL AND IMAGINAL MATERIAL. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT (1) MENTAL IMAGERY AND <b>DRAWING</b> COMPETENCE ARE STRONGLY RELUTED. (2) THE LEVEL OF <b>DRAWING</b> COMPETENCE HAS A STRONG INFLUENCE ON MENTAL MANIPULATION OF VERBAL MATERIAL: "HIGH-DRAWERS" RECALL, AND DESCRIBE CONCRETE AND RELATED CONCEEPTS BETTER THAN "LOW DRAWERS" ON THE CONTRAVY "LOW DRAWERS" HANDLE ABSTRACT CONCEPTS MORE EASILY. (3) THE IMAGINAL SYSTEM PRIMAVILY USED BY "HIGH-DRAWERS", IS SPECIALIGED IN HANDLING CONCRETE AND RELATED CONCEPTS. THE VERBAL SYSTEM, PRIMAVILY USED BY "LOW-DRAWERS" IS SPECIALIGED IN HANDLING ABSTRACT AND NOT VELUTED CONCEPTS. PERCEPTUAL AFFECTS MENTAL MANIPULATION OF CONCEPTS THIS SUGGESTING THE ASSUMPTION THAT PERCEPTION AND MENTAL IMAGERY ARE ISOMOPHIC. IT PROBABLE THAT THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE OF WORKING "PREFERS" THE IMAGINAL WAY OF FUNCTIONIG. ...|$|R

5|$|Construction of Selfe's {{version of}} the Sydney harbour bridge never started due to an {{economic}} slowdown and a change of government at the 1904 state election. Much to Selfe's outrage, the Department of Public Works kept his calculations and <b>drawings,</b> and also copied and printed them. Eventually in 1907, the department contacted Selfe {{and asked him to}} collect his <b>drawings,</b> but refused to return the calculations. Selfe was never given the £1,100 prize, nor was he paid for his subsequent work which he estimated to be worth more than £20,000.|$|E
5|$|Despite this protest, {{two sets}} of {{illustrations}} for Candide were produced by the French artist Jean-Michel Moreau le Jeune. The first version was done, at Moreau's own expense, in 1787 and included in Kehl's publication of that year, Oeuvres Complètes de Voltaire. Four images were drawn by Moreau for this edition and were engraved by Pierre-Charles Baquoy. The second version, in 1803, consisted of seven <b>drawings</b> by Moreau which were transposed by multiple engravers. The twentieth-century modern artist Paul Klee stated that it was while reading Candide that he discovered his own artistic style. Klee illustrated the work, and his <b>drawings</b> were published in a 1920 version edited by Kurt Wolff.|$|E

5|$|During {{his later}} {{creative}} years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic <b>drawings,</b> sketched {{in a loose}} way, without taking his pencil from the paper or {{his eyes from the}} model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, and the next year sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous <b>drawings</b> from the experience.|$|E

5|$|Germany and the Netherlands were {{eventually}} {{able to reach}} an agreement where Germany would release plans and <b>drawings</b> based upon their ideas for a battlecruiser, in return for a guarantee that all needed equipment would be ordered from German firms. With their assistance (mainly through NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw), a rough design was formulated by February 1940. A visit to Italy prompted a rethink of the internal layout, which led to a set of <b>drawings</b> dated 19 April 1940. This is the last known design produced prior to Germany's invasion and occupation of the Netherlands. Final plans for the ships were never completed, and the ships were never constructed.|$|E
