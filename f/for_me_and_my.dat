Surrounding each one was the dim outline of a small human figure, black and grotesque, more like a little image carved out of black shining wood, than anything else I can liken them to. Dorothea kissed her hands to these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence. As <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> companions, we were so awe-struck yet amused at these comical shapes, {{that we could not}} move or speak until they themselves seemed to flit about in a sort of wavering dance, and then vanish, one by one.|$|E

25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning.
