40|$|Abstract Fault step-overs with linking <b>dip-slip</b> <b>faults</b> {{are common}} {{features}} on long strike-slip fault systems worldwide. It {{has been noted}} by various researchers that under some circumstances, earthquakes can jump across fault step-overs to cascade into large events, while under other circumstances rupture is arrested at stepovers. There is also evidence that fault step-overs may be preferential locations for earthquake nucleation. The present work uses the 3 D finite element method to model the dynamics of strike-slip fault systems with step-overs and linking <b>dip-slip</b> <b>faults.</b> I find {{that the presence of}} a linking normal or thrust fault greatly increases the ability of earthquake rupture to propagate across the step-over, leading to a larger event. Additionally, dilational step-overs with linking normal faults are more prone to through-going rupture than compressional step-overs with linking thrust faults. This difference is due to the sign of the normal stress increment on the <b>dip-slip</b> <b>fault</b> caused by slip on the strike-slip segments: Slip on the strike-slip segments causes a negative (unclamping) normal stress increment on the linking normal fault in a dilational step-over, whereas the opposite effect occurs on the linking thrust fault in...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Unlike strike-slip earthquakes, the {{physical}} properties of shallow dip-slip quakes remain unexplored {{because of the}} insufficient number of near-field seismological recordings and analytical difficulties {{at the tip of}} a surface-breaking fault. Here, based on the finite difference technique and dynamic photoelasticity in conjunction with high speed digital cinematography, we numerically and experimentally simulate the source dynamics of <b>dip-slip</b> <b>faulting.</b> Our two-dimensional model may contain a flat fault plane (interface) dipping either vertically or at some angle in a monolithic linear elastic medium. We record the evolution of wave field related to the crack-like rupture along this fault. The observations suggest if the fault rupture, initiated at some depth, arrests just below or reaches the free surface, four Rayleigh-type waves are generated: two propagating along the free surface into the opposite directions to the far field, the other two moving back along the fractured interface downwards into depth. These downward interface waves may largely control the stopping phase of the dynamic rupture. In the case of an inclined fault plane, the interface and Rayleigh waves interact with each other and a shear wave carrying concentrated kinematic energy (corner wave) is induced to generate enormously strong particle motions in the hanging wall...|$|E
40|$|Though mode II shear {{fractures}} (primarily strike-slip earthquakes) can {{not only}} exceed the shear wave speed of the medium, but can even reach the compressional wave speed, steady-state calculations showed that speeds between the Rayleigh and shear wave speeds were not possible, thus defining a forbidden zone. For more than 30 years {{it was believed that}} this result in which the rupture jumps over the forbidden zone, also holds for 3 -D ruptures, in which mode II and mode III (mainly <b>dip-slip</b> <b>faulting)</b> are mixed. Using unprecedentedly fine spatial and temporal grids, we show that even in the simple configuration of homogeneous fault properties and linear slip-weakening friction law, a realistic 3 -D rupture which starts from rest and accelerates to some higher velocity, actually does pass smoothly through this forbidden zone, but very fast. The energy flux from the rupture tip is always positive, even within the so-called forbidden zone, contrary to the 2 -D case. Finally, our results show that the width of the cohesive zone initially decreases, then increases as the rupture exceeds the shear wave speed and finally again decreases as the rupture accelerates to a speed of ~ 90 % of the compressional wave speed. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|During an {{earthquake}} event, seismic oscilation might {{be accompanied by}} large surface soil movement, due to the outcrop of the causative fault. This fault rupture has proved to have had disastrous effects on several structures it came across during past earthquakes. Yet, {{there have also been}} cases reported, where the structure has survived this encounter, almost intact. In this project, the response of a typical overpass bridge subjected to <b>dip-slip</b> <b>faulting</b> is examined. The bridge under examination has two spans and its mid-pier is founded on an isolated footing. A 2 D finite element parametric analysis is being carried out, in the first place, taking only the footing into consideration, in order to comprehend the various ways in which the system interacts, based on its geometry. As it turns out, the exact location of the foundation relative to the fault is a key factor to the interplay of the soil-foundation system. Further on, the most characteristic results of the above step are being compared with results derived from an equivalent 3 D model. Eventually, the bridge’s superstructure is added to the 3 D model, in order to investigate its impact on the response of the whole system. The results point out that when examining problems of this type, it is essential that the whole structure is modelled, because not only it modifies the way the other components behave, but also because the superstructure itself might suffer substantial damage.

40|$|Understanding {{the past}} and present distribution, form, and {{behavior}} of water on Mars is critical to assessing whether the planet is, or was ever, a habitable world. This thesis examines the evidence for a more water-rich past that is preserved at two key locations on Mars: (1) Gusev crater, the landing site of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Spirit; and (2) Eberswalde crater, a candidate landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity. At Gusev Crater, the discovery of hydrated silica- and sulfate-rich soils in the Columbia Hills was one of most significant results of the MER Spirit mission. In visible to near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectra from the Pancam instrument, an H 2 O and/or OH absorption feature near 1000 nm is characteristic of the silica-rich materials. This spectral feature has been used to developed a ''hydration signature" for mapping the distribution of hydrated materials at Gusev crater. An extensive study of the Vis-NIR spectra of natural and synthetic silica-rich materials has been performed to help interpret observations of silica on Mars. Temporal observations of the silica- and sulfate-rich soil spectra reveal that no statistically significant spectral changes occurred, implying that the minerals have not undergone dehydration after their exposure. Eberswalde Crater is famous for the spectacularly preserved delta near its western wall, which indicates an aqueous sedimentary environment. Five additional fluvio-deltaic systems in the crater are identified and described in this work. The identification and mapping of a fault system in and around the crater has revealed the topography as being largely controlled by <b>dip-slip</b> <b>faulting.</b> A detailed geologic characterization of the entire Eberswalde crater basin has also been performed, and maps of stratigraphic and geomorphic units have been produced.

The operation of portable seismographs in the active region and favorable location of the main seismic activity with respect to the permanent seismograph network in NE-Iceland allow a more detailed study of this deflation event than most of the other events. Continuous volcanic tremor appeared on the local seismographs shortly before 16 h on September 8, 1977. Deflation of the volcano began at the same time. A small basaltic eruption broke out on a 0. 9 km long fissure near the northern rim of the caldera at about 18 h. Earthquake activity increased soon after the beginning of the tremor and the first earthquakes were located in the caldera region. The earthquake activity then migrated southwards along the Krafla fault swarm with a speed of about 0. 5 m sec{sup - 1 }, and culminated shortly before midnight with 8 earthquakes larger than magnitude 3 that were located near the Namafjall geothermal area 8 km south of the center of the caldera. Shortly after the earthquake activity migrated into the Namafjall area small amounts of basaltic pumice were erupted through a 1138 m deep drill hole there. Depths of earthquakes were 0 - 6 km in the northern part of the hypocentral zone and 0 - 4 in the southern part. The first motion pattern of P-waves suggests <b>dip-slip</b> <b>faulting</b> on steeply dipping fault planes consistent with the extensive normal faulting observed on the surface throughout the epicentral zone.

40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} of Cenozoic stress {{patterns in the}} northern North Sea and the mid-Norwegian margin is presented, {{and the sense of}} potential slip along major fault planes belonging to the two areas is restored. We assume that the main regional source of stresses is the Atlantic ridge push as demonstrated by previous studies. Furthermore, we also assume a nearly consistent NW-SE strike for the far-field stress from continental breakup between Greenland and Norway (earliest Eocene) to present day. First, we applied the commercial two-dimensional distinct element method (UDEC) to simulate Cenozoic stress and displacement patterns in the study area. Variations in rheology and major fault zones were introduced into the model. The Møore-Trøondelag Fault Complex and its inferred continuation into the Shetland Platform forms the major mechanical discontinuity in the model. Second, we used the SORTAN method, developed at the University of Paris VI, to predict the sense of potential slip along major fault planes. The input for the SORTAN model was constrained by the geometry of the selected fault planes and local principal stress directions extracted from the UDEC modeling. Our results show that the Møore-Trøondelag Fault Complex and its inferred continuation into the Shetland Platform act as a weak fault zone. This fault zone divides the study area into two different stress provinces: the continental margin and the northern North Sea. This result agrees well with the observed differences in Cenozoic structural evolution of the two areas. Compressive structures are observed along the continental margin, whereas relative tectonic quiescence characterizes the northern North Sea during the Tertiary. The restored stress patterns in the northern North Sea and the mid-Norwegian margin also agree well with the observed present-day stress configuration. Our analysis demonstrates a method to reconstruct the sense of slip on major fault planes by combining two complementary numerical tools (UDEC and SORTAN). As a result, it is demonstrated that oblique-slip motions are mainly expected, in particular, strike-slip and reverse <b>dip-slip</b> <b>faulting</b> are simulated...|$|E
