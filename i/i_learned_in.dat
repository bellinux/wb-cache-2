25|$|Less than a {{month after}} the Korean War {{armistice}} (a cessation of hostilities), Miller wound up in a drunk tank in North Georgia Mountains. Miller stated later that this incident was the lowest point of his life. Upon his release, Miller enlisted in the Marines. During his three years in the United States Marine Corps, Miller attained the rank of sergeant. He often refers to the value of his experience in the Marine Corps in his writing and stump speeches; in his book on the subject, entitled Corps Values: Everything You Need to Know <b>I</b> <b>Learned</b> <b>in</b> the Marines, he wrote: In the twelve weeks of hell and transformation that were Marine Corps boot camp, I learned the values of achieving a successful life that have guided and sustained me on the course which, although sometimes checkered and detoured, I have followed ever since.|$|E
500|$|Sanford {{was born}} in 1917 in Laurinburg, North Carolina, the son of Elizabeth Terry (Martin) and Cecil Leroy Sanford, both of English descent. He became an Eagle Scout in Laurinburg's Troop 20 of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Shortly before he died, Sanford related his Scouting {{experience}} to journalist David Gergen and said that it [...] "probably saved {{my life in the}} war. Boys who had been Scouts or had been in the CCC knew how to look after themselves in the woods.... What <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> Scouts sustained me all my life; it helped me make decisions about what was best." [...] The BSA recognized him with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.|$|E
500|$|The March 30, 1974, concert {{featured}} an ethnically and age-diverse {{audience that}} included young hippies and old, wealthy attendees. According to Magnet magazine's Bryan Bierman, [...] "the hip, 'with it' kids [...] side-by-side with middle-aged tuxedoed couples, expecting to hear 'My Funny Valentine.'" [...] Although he lived only 15 minutes away, Davis {{arrived at the}} venue {{more than an hour}} late. When the band walked out onstage, he followed with his back turned to the audience, casually strolling onstage while the other musicians were setting up. Davis immediately began to play, and the band responded by playing a dense rhythm in unison. Saxophonist Dave Liebman, writing in the 1997 US reissue liner notes for Dark Magus, recalled the start of the show: [...] "It is his whim [...]. That's the thing!... Miles can do that and have three thousand musicians follow him. Right? So what <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> that respect from Miles was to be able to watch him and be on his case".|$|E

Unlike the original version, the acoustic version did not feature Tyler Carter as guest vocalist, but instead featured former Kid's Jackson Summer vocalist Kate Ellen Dean.|$|R

One night we huddled around a burning stove when a group of Chetniks barged in. One of them I guess had kids of his own so he sat me down on his lap and asked me if I'm a Serb.

2500|$|In 1925, Ball, {{then only}} 14, started dating Johnny DeVita, a 21-year-old local hoodlum. DeDe {{was unhappy with}} the relationship, {{but was unable to}} {{influence}} her daughter to end it. She expected the romance to burn out in a few weeks, but that did not happen. After about a year, DeDe tried to separate them by using Lucille's desire to be in show business. Despite the family's meager finances, she arranged for Lucille to go to the John Murray Anderson School for the Dramatic Arts in New York City, where Bette Davis was a fellow student. Ball later said about that time in her life, [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> drama school was how to be frightened." [...] Ball's instructors felt that she would not be successful in the entertainment business, and were not afraid to say this in front of her, a criticism which Ball did not enjoy hearing.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs {{would later}} credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene 'Teddy' Hill, with turning him around: [...] "She taught an {{advanced}} fourth grade class {{and it took}} her about a month to get hip to my situation. She bribed me into learning. She would say, 'I really want you to finish this workbook. I'll give you five bucks if you finish it.' That really kindled a passion in me for learning things! I learned more that year than I think <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> any other year in school. They wanted me to skip {{the next two years}} in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn't let it happen." [...] Jobs skipped the fifth grade and transferred to the sixth grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View where he became a [...] "socially awkward loner." [...] Jobs [...] "was often bullied" [...] and gave his parents an ultimatum: they had to either take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school.|$|E
