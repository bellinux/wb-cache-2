During periods of prosperity, people <b>forget</b> about <b>crisis,</b> neglecting the aspect of designing systems for handling possible crisis. Both the financial crisis and the significant financial tensions are considered rare events. Due to this, the mechanisms of handling the existing crisis at the time it appeared could be improper, certain laws being able to slow the action, or the instruments and formalities in a country may be different, this leading to lack of cooperation between states. At the same time, Romania, being affected by the crisis, causes discussions about its nature, about the methods of surpassing the difficulties and promoting the Romanian society.

40|$|Introduction. Russia’s {{annexation}} of the Crimea and subsequent meddling in Ukraine {{does not constitute}} a game-changer. It is just a reminder that {{at least since the}} war with Georgia in 2008 Russia has been and still is playing the same game: a “game of zones”, aimed at (re) establishing an exclusive sphere of influence. Many of us Europeans had forgotten that, or had pushed it to the back of our minds, preferring to believe that we were not engaged in a zero-sum game in our eastern neighbourhood. While we were dealing with Ukraine, we tended also to <b>forget</b> the <b>crises</b> still going on in our southern neighbourhood, in Libya, Mali, Syria and now Iraq. Spilling over from Syria, extremist militias may establish their own “zone” in the Middle East, which would de-stabilize the entire region. In order to prevent that game-changer from materializing, another game-changer may be necessary: a rapprochement with Iran. Europe must assume responsibility for security in its entire neighbourhood, both east and south. The challenge is great – but so are Europe’s means...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY It is {{important}} to consider that nowadays consumers behaviours are experimenting changes at time of purchasing, being more aware of the waste of resources and trying to control impulsive purchases. These changes can be named as the new “green-thinking ” trend, which is being expanded in the society, and which has generated a great importance for both consumers and enterprises. Although there are individuals who perform responsible consumption practices because of an ethical responsibility feeling, we can´t <b>forget</b> the economic <b>crisis</b> consequences, which has obliged affected individuals to adopt responsible consumption behaviours. In this context, this market research has been carried out to analyse the level of knowledge about responsible consumption initiatives owned by consumers, responsible consumption practices performed by them as well as the reasons and barriers of such practices. After the research, some conclusions obtained from the results and recommendations for public and private institutions are presented. KEY WORDS Responsible consumptio...|$|R

Forget about the troubles. <b>Forget</b> about the <b>crisis.</b> <b>Forget</b> everything for a minute- at least while they listen to the music. Shakira She Wolf is primarily an electropop album that combines influences from the musical styles of various countries and regions, like Africa, Colombia, India, and the Middle East. Shakira termed the album a [...] "sonic experimental trip", and said that she researched folk music from different countries in order to [...] "combine electronics with world sounds, tambourines, clarinets, oriental and Hindu music, dancehall, etc." [...] The title track {{is an example of the}} electronic music styled production of the album, and is composed of 70s disco guitars and [...] "heaps of robot effects". [...] "Did It Again" [...] is a midtempo electropop song that contains elements of samba. World music influences surface on songs like [...] "Why Wait" [...] and [...] "Gypsy", the former is a heavy synth based electro-funk song with Led Zeppelin-inspired Middle Eastern strings, while the latter is included as the [...] "closest thing to an acoustic song on the album" [...] and features instrumentation from mandolin, banjo, sitar and tabla. Tracks like [...] "Long Time" [...] and [...] "Good Stuff" [...] display dancehall, electronica and Latin elements. Critics found the 1980s-stylised electropop track [...] "Men in This Town" [...] similar to the work of American band No Doubt.

40|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} (CSR), financial exclusion and banks {{are not happy}} bed fellows, yet their relationship and working partnership is essential to ensure financial security within a stable economy. The position {{of this paper is}} to contextualise the CSR of banks within the current economic climate and comes to the unsatisfactory position that CSR and financial exclusion may be <b>forgotten</b> until the <b>crisis</b> is over and recovery begins. What is currently important in terms of economics is that the system works for the whole not the few and that regulatory focus is drawn fully to secure the crisis and work on rebuilding trust and confidence within the broken and troubled banking industry. In order to examine this proposition, the paper is divided into five parts. Firstly the paper examines the origins and developments of CSR. Secondly the paper examines the CSR of banks in the UK and compares it to the regulatory approach in the United States. Thirdly the researchers explore the notions of financial exclusion and how it interrelates with {{social responsibility}} of the banks. Penultimately the researchers examine the ethical aspects of the banks business and conclude with an examination of the CSR guidelines and disclosure rules.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we try to}} point out the lost {{opportunity}} on how to address the current <b>crisis,</b> <b>forgetting</b> principles and theories that were successfully applied in the Great Depression. After some considerations about the Stock Market Crash that began on October 24, 1929 and their catastrophic consequences, we analyze the reaction of European authorities to the present crisis, highlighting the financial costs and the loss of welfare that has led to the rescue of peripheral Eurozone countries. Our analysis is based on the interpretation in the framework of the present time of the work and thought of John Maynard Keynes. In this comparative analysis we find a strong contrast between the economic policy outlined in those times by our honorable English economist, and the presence of a recalcitrant single thought and the reductionist determinism that have characterized the economic policies bring about in the crisis years in our country and, in general, in the Eurozone area, given rise to an avoidable situation of austerity and recession we have suffered between 2008 and 2013. In the article we stand out the fact that the Great Depression was harsher and more terrible that the Financial Crisis of these last years, but it was better managed by the American Authorities, otherwise happening with the crisis that we are undergoing...|$|R
40|$|The {{level of}} {{brutality}} and violence against children abducted and forcefully conscripted by the Lord¿s Resistance Army (LRA) in northern Uganda pricked {{the conscience of}} humanity. The suffering {{of the people in}} northern Uganda was described by Jan Egeland, the former United Nations Under- Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs, as ¿the biggest <b>forgotten</b> humanitarian <b>crisis</b> in the world¿. This study is primarily concerned with the plight of child soldiers in northern Uganda and how their effective reintegration and rehabilitation (RR) could lead to successful peacebuilding. The study is premised on the hypothesis that ¿the promotion of the RR of former child soldiers by providing psychosocial support based on traditional and indigenous resources may contribute to conditions of peace and stability in northern Uganda. ¿ The main contribution of this research is that it explores the relevance of psychosocial support based on the traditional and indigenous resources to the RR of child soldiers and peacebuilding of war-torn societies. Psychosocial support based on traditional and indigenous resources as an element of peacebuilding has been the neglected element of peacebuilding by the liberal peacebuilding interventions in most war-torn societies. For example, while traditional and indigenous resources in northern Uganda have been instrumental in the RR of former child soldiers, most scholars and policy makers have largely paid attention to the usual official government and United Nations structured top-down interventions that emphasize Western approaches of peacebuilding. More so, the official approaches have tended to marginalize the plight of former child soldiers in the reconstruction and peacebuilding of northern Uganda. Yet, failing to pay sufficient attention to effective RR of child soldiers could undermine the peace dividends already achieved in northern Uganda. The study also analyses the limitations of psychosocial support based on traditional and indigenous resources in the RR of former child soldiers. It further examines why Western approaches of psychosocial support in the RR of child soldiers have remained in use in spite of the criticisms levelled against them. The study examines other peacebuilding interventions, both official and unofficial, that have been implemented in northern Uganda. In terms of key findings, the study establishes that traditional and indigenous resources are still popular and have been widely used in northern Uganda in the RR of child soldiers. Majority of former child soldiers who were interviewed observed that they found traditional and indigenous resources more helpful than the Western models of psychosocial support. However, it was also established that there is a significant section of former child soldiers who found Western models more relevant in their RR processes. Based on these findings, the study recommends an integrative and holistic model of psychosocial support that blends good elements from both traditional and indigenous resources and Western approaches with greater emphasis on the former.

40|$|The {{international}} {{scientific community}} aims to coordinate its agricultural research efforts within a global system which brings together the national agricultural research systems (NARS), the international research institutes of the CGIAR {{system and the}} institutions and research centres of the industrialized countries. For Dr Oumar Niangado, the efficiency and legitimacy of this system depend largely on the role played within it by the national agricultural research systems of developing countries. The national agricultural research systems in developing countries have a determining {{role to play in}} global development research. Everyone remembers the financial crisis that the international agricultural research centres of the CGIAR system experienced two or three years ago. And no-one could <b>forget</b> the deep <b>crisis</b> in confidence which shook the research community. It should also be remembered that from 1974 the international centres were to improve the competence of the national systems. However, over twenty years later, yields of cereals, for example, have not achieved the results expected. Why? We often hear it said that all it requires to achieve a green revolution in Africa is to select high yielding varieties and transform the environment. But our farmers are not able to transform their environment. They do not have the means to do so because they are poor. Often they do not even have a pair of oxen. How can they make use of a technology that requires them to work their soil to 20 cm depth or to apply fertilizers which they do not have? On the other hand, what they do have is a tradition and a knowledge of how to do things in their own environment and it is upon this knowledge that research should be based. The materials, methods and technologies put forward should be based on and adapted to the local environment, not the other way around. This is where the problem lies and it is also why, so often, new technologies developed on the research stations of international centres are found to be inappropriate for farmers in the South. It is for this reason also that I am entirely in agreement with the view expressed by Jean Pichot in Something else, some other way (Spore 65). The aims of agricultural research have been too, high and too far-reaching. Techniques, choice of varieties and biotechnology are {{out of touch with the}} real needs of people. In reality our farmers have problems that are relatively easy to define: they need virus-resistant varieties of tomatoes, or cereals that resist striga or a specific insect. They may need, for example, an earlier maturing variety to avoid the risk of drought in the final stages of growth. Farmers also have needs for services that are unrelated to research, for example, a supply of fertilizer or access to credit. They need to be trained in order to understand how the market works, how to gain access to it and how to manage their business. In short, what farmers need are service providers rather thon development bodies but what we see is this 'global system' of agricultural research. 'Who directs research initiatives?' is the question that should be asked. Southern scientists, including those from Africa, should be able to exercise more influence over CGIAR decision-making and the general directions taken by the global system. Donors and institutions within industrialized countries have encouraged regionalization and one effect of this has been to develop what have become known as eco-regions. But whatever initiatives the CGIAR and the international scientific community may take, they are ultimately dependent on the NARS if those initiatives are to be effective. I do not believe that it is realistic to contemplate a regional approach to research conceived from on high. On the contrary, we should start from the bottom, with the national systems that are able to listen to what local people need, and respond to their immediate and straightforward requests. Efficiency demands this. Everyone talks nowadays of participatory development and involving users in programme planning, implementation and evaluation, in other words the 'user-driven project'. It is the NARS which are best placed for achieving this essential, grassroots contact. Who better than the NARS to talk to the users or better understand their needs? We share the same environment and traditions and are therefore much better able to judge what is needed than those who can only hear about it or try to understand it from afar. To be truly effective, the NARS should undertake without delay a survey of farmers' needs. Difficulties which do not often come to light or which are rarely expressed should also be taken into account. However, this work can only be done by people based in developing countries. NGOs and rural organizations have an important role to play and have become partners in this work which is also helping to encourage local, professional leaders. Above all, we should stop trying to transfer technology according to imported concepts or principles. In Mali, for example, we have developed our systems approach over 20 years with the help of KIT (Royal Tropical Institute, The Netherlands) because we believe that we need regional teams that are capable of listening to local people, taking note of the challenges they face and using this knowledge to plan research projects. As a NARS we need to take on board problems to which we can bring solutions but those to which we cannot respond we transfer to the regional level. For us in the South, the challenge of the future lies in this role. We shall only be satisfied when we can truly match our research programmes to the needs of local people. We are trying to do it. We have not yet totally succeeded, but we shall get better. Problems that can best be resolved at a regional level will continue to emerge, which justifies the need for a global system. However, it will not be effective unless the NARS are strengthened. This is essential if we are to meet the needs of the people for whom we work and from whom we seek support.
