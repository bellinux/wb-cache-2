500|$|Bright {{commented that}} Shields' {{performance}} was [...] "a little into silly land" [...] at first, but it [...] "eventually {{turned in a}} very funny performance." [...] Shields commented {{that when she was}} asked to appear on the show, she [...] "said yes basically sight unseen. I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was on the list. Maybe everybody else said no." [...] The writers had difficulty devising jokes that would be funny when Van Damme said them. In order to create [...] "Van Damme-proof" [...] jokes, one writer [...] "would say them in a really horrible French accent, putting the emphasis on the wrong word". If people laughed, Van Damme was given the joke to perform. One line created in this way was Van Damme's [...] "I can crack a walnut with my butt." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1916, Coach Yost {{shared his}} {{recollections}} of the Buffalo game with Big Bill Edwards: [...] "Buffalo University came to Michigan with a much-heralded team. They were coached by a Dartmouth man {{and had not}} been scored upon. Buffalo papers referred to Michigan as the Woolly Westerners, and the Buffalo enthusiasts placed bets that Michigan would not score." [...] The score {{at the end of}} the first half was 65 to 0. About fifteen minutes after the second half had started, Yost discovered a Buffalo player, Simpson, [...] "on Michigan's side of the field, covered up in a blanket." [...] Yost was curious and asked, [...] "Simpson, what are you doing over here? You are on the wrong side." [...] To which, Simpson replied, [...] "Don't say anything. I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am at. The coach has put me in three times already and I'm not going in there again. Enough is enough for any one. I've had mine." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{becoming}} {{a model to}} support her acting career, Guillory waited tables at a club. In an interview in 2000, she said about the experience [...] "Supporting my acting habit with waitressing {{was probably the most}} useful thing I've done." [...] During her time as a model, she studied acting at the New World School of the Arts and the Paris Conservatoire, also taking small television and film roles in The Future Lasts a Long Time (1996), The Rules of Engagement (1999), Star! Star! (1999), Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang) (2000), The 3 Kings (2000), and Two Days, Nine Lives (2000). During this time, Guillory decided to go on with her acting career because [...] "I was so scared of going to university and being with people my own age again, having been with that tiny little sect of girls in Norfolk whose daddies were farmers and politicians, who didn't trust me and didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was coming from".|$|E

500|$|According to The New York Times, {{the film}} became a [...] "star vehicle" [...] for Song. The film was about an average, popular Chinese-American {{teenager}} whose life is {{turned upside down}} by a visit from a young Chinese monk (Shin Koyamada). The monk claims she is the reincarnation of a powerful female warrior and {{the only person who}} can prevent an ancient evil spirit from destroying the world. In a second story line, Wendy and most of her family struggle with keeping their culture and heritage. Song felt she could relate to the message since she knew little about her own people before making the film. She said, [...] "I really identified with Wendy because I don't want to not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> came from". To promote the film, she posed for the cover of Seventeen, Teen People, Teen, Seventeen Malaysia, and several other magazines, and traveled to Malaysia, Singapore, and Costa Rica. A Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior sequel, starring Song and Koyamada, was announced in the end of 2007.|$|E
500|$|As Alfred Gough sees it, Lana is a {{by-product}} of Clark and Lex's decisions. She will always love Clark, and Clark will always love her, but it was Clark's bad decisions, and Lex's [...] "basest instincts" [...] that make Lana the [...] "receptacle {{of all of these}} bad decisions", marking her as a tragic figure on the show. While Lana was with Clark, Kreuk characterizes her as a [...] "wimpy, whiny kind of girl"; with Lex, Lana is [...] "strong, powerful, and doesn't have to question, 'What is going on? What does he think? Does he love me? I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> stand.'" [...] To clarify, Lana's relationship with Lex brings out a darkness that had not been seen in the character. This is evident in [...] "Nemesis" [...] when Lana manipulates her way into seeing Lionel, only to interrogate him about why he forced her to marry Lex, as well as leaving Lex to die in the underground tunnels. As Gough explains, {{by the end of the}} sixth season, Lana has shown that she can beat Lex at his own games.|$|E
500|$|The {{fragrance}} {{is described}} by Steal Their Style as a [...] "feminine and flowery fragrance".

Collectively with Glow by JLo, it brought in over $USD300 million within a year, making Lopez the nineteenth richest person under forty, according to business magazine Forbes. The Fragrance Foundation's FiFi Awards named it the [...] "Celebrity Fragrance of the Year" [...] in June 2003. Several writers compared the theme of Still Jennifer Lopez's promotional campaign to her hit-song [...] "Jenny from the Block" [...] (2002), in which she declared [...] "I'm Still, I'm Still Jenny from the Block / Used to have a little now I have a lot / No matter where I go, I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> came from." [...] Speaking about the fragrance's slogan, The New York Times wrote that it is [...] "a line that refers partly to her composure under the media glare but also serves as a pitch to potential consumers [...] It also evokes a song from her latest album, Jenny from the Block, in which she declares that despite fame, she is essentially her old self from South Bronx." ...|$|E

Domingo de Santa Clara actually existed. There was an Abraham a Sancta Clara, he was some religious fanatic. I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> got it from, but the name pleased me very much: Abraham a Sancta Clara. And since the name Domingo pleases me as well, I called him Domingo." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joe Swash has {{revealed}} that giving Mickey a family was not the producers' original plan for the character, but he was pleased when he was told of the development one year prior to their introduction: [...] "Before, I {{was in and out}} all the time. I didn't really <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> stood as an actor. Now that the family are here, I feel like Mickey's a more regular character. I'm really happy about it [...] I didn't know exactly what they'd be like until about three or four months ago. They're really different which I think is good. I'm really pleased with them [...] they're really close. They won't hear a bad word said about each other. They'll kid each other in private, but in public they rally round and stick up for each other [...] a bit of a mummy's boy." ...|$|E

2500|$|... {{described}} {{the situation as}} [...] "admirable" [...] {{during a visit to}} the Philippines in the 1870s.The lines separating entire classes and races, appeared to me less marked than in the Oriental colonies. I have seen on the same table, Spaniards, Mestizos (Chinos cristianos) and Indios, priests and military. There is no doubt that having one Religion forms great bonding. And more so to the eyes of one that has been observing the repulsion and differences due to race in many parts of Asia. And from one (like myself) who knows that race is the great divider of society, the admirable contrast and exception to racial discrimination so markedly presented by the people of the Philippines is indeed admirable.Another foreign witness was English engineer, Frederic H. Sawyer, who had {{spent most of his life}} in different parts of Asia and lived in Luzon for fourteen years. His impression was that as far as racial integration and harmony was concerned, the situation in the Philippines was not equaled by any other colonial power:"... Spaniards and natives lived together in great harmony, and do not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> could find a colony in which Europeans mixes as much socially with the natives.|$|E
2500|$|Hoppus {{describes}} himself as [...] "pretty straight" [...] until junior high, when he began skateboarding and listening to punk rock. He lived in Fairfax, Virginia (a suburb of Washington, D.C.) during his early high school years and attended Annandale High School during his second year, at which time he received his first bass guitar and attended his first concert: They Might Be Giants at the [...] shortly before his sixteenth birthday, March 4, 1988. [...] "I didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> should stand or what I should do, so my friends and I bought some menthol cigarettes and smoked {{for the first time}} and tried to look as cool as we could. We probably looked like idiots," [...] Hoppus remembered. Hoppus received his first bass (a Mako) as a gift from his father, purchased at a local music shop in Annandale. He earned money for a set of amplifiers by helping him paint his house. Hoppus never took bass lessons, instead he taught himself by playing to bands such as the Descendents, The Cure, and Bad Religion. Hoppus has remarked that [...] "Silly Girl" [...] by the Descendents was the [...] "song that made me fall in love with punk rock music [...] that song changed my life forever." [...] Likewise, Hoppus borrowed a cassette version of The Cure's Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me from friend Wendy Franklin the summer following junior high school and was taken with [...] "Just Like Heaven".|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, he {{sold out}} the Pavilion Theatre {{in his home}} town. In 1975, the rapidity and extent of Connolly's {{breakthrough}} was used to secure him a booking on Britain's premier TV chat show, the BBC's Parkinson. Connolly {{made the most of}} the opportunity and, ignoring objections from his manager, told a bawdy joke about a man who had murdered his wife and buried her bottom-up so he'd have somewhere to park his bike. This ribald humour was unusually forthright on a primetime Saturday night on British television in the mid-1970s, and his appearance made a great impact. He became a good friend of the host, Michael Parkinson, and now holds the record for appearances on the programme, having been a guest on fifteen occasions. Referring to that debut appearance, he later said: [...] "That programme changed my entire life." [...] Parkinson, in the documentary Billy Connolly: Erect for 30 Years, stated that people still remember Connolly telling the punchline to the 'bike joke' three decades after that TV appearance. When asked about the material, Connolly stated, [...] "Yes, it was incredibly edgy for its time. My manager, on the way over, warned me not to do it, but it was a great joke and the interview was going so well, I thought, 'Oh, fuck that!!' I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> got the courage in those days, but Michael did put confidence in me." [...] Connolly's UK success spread to other English-speaking countries: Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. [...] However, his broad Scottish accent and British cultural references made success in the US improbable.|$|E
