50|$|The <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Tyrannus savana) is a {{passerine}} bird of {{the tyrant}} flycatcher family, {{and is the}} member of a genus typically referred to as kingbirds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>flycatcher</b> {{is white}} below, gray above, {{and has a}} black cap. Males {{sometimes}} show a yellow crown stripe. Males also have an extremely long forked tail, of even greater length than that of their cousin, the scissor-tailed flycatcher. Females have a somewhat shorter tail, while it is significantly shorter in juveniles. Males are 37 - 41 cm in length; females, 28 - 30 cm, including tail. They weigh only 28 - 32 g, much less than closely related kingbirds, which are half the total length of this species. The <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>flycatcher</b> has the longest tail relative to body size of any bird on earth. The tail in adult males is 2-3 times longer than {{the length of the}} bird from the bill {{to the base of the}} tail.|$|E
50|$|Migratory {{bird species}} include American purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinicus), solitary sandpiper (Tringa solitaria), yellow-billed tern (Sternula superciliaris), black skimmer (Rynchops niger), yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus), Swainson's flycatcher (Myiarchus swainsoni), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), {{tropical}} kingbird, <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Tyrannus savana), {{southern rough-winged swallow}} (Stelgidopteryx ruficollis), grey-breasted martin (Progne chalybea) and sand martin (Riparia riparia).|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the timing of {{migration}}, migration routes, and migratory connectivity of most of the > 230 species of birds that breed at south temperate latitudes of South America and then migrate toward the tropics to overwinter. We used light-level geolocators to track the migration of 3 male and 3 female <b>Fork-tailed</b> <b>Flycatchers</b> (Tyrannus savana) captured on their breeding territories in Argentina. All birds initiated fall migration between late January and late February, and migrated 45 to 66 km day– 1 in a northwesterly direction through central South America to either one or two wintering areas. Five individuals first spent several weeks (in April and May) in western Amazonia (mainly Peru, northwestern Brazil, and southern Colombia) before moving east {{to spend the rest of}} the non-breeding season in central Venezuela and northern Brazil. One individual occupied primarily one wintering area in eastern Colombia, northwestern Brazil, and southwestern Venezuela. Fall migration took approximately 7 – 12 weeks to complete and covered a distance of 2, 888 – 4, 105 km. We did not analyze spring migration data because of broad overlap with the austral spring equinox. These results are the first data on wintering locations, migration timing, and routes of individual migrant passerine birds that breed in South America. Given the general lack of similar data for practically all migratory birds that breed in South America, geolocator technology has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of how birds migrate—and the threats they face—on South America’s rapidly changing landscape...|$|R
50|$|The {{smallest}} {{family members}} are the closely related short-tailed pygmy tyrant and black-capped pygmy tyrant from the Myiornis genus (the first species usually being considered marginally smaller on average). These species reach a total length of 6.5 - 7 cm and a weight of 4-5 grams. By length, they are the smallest passerines on earth, although some species of Old World warblers apparently rival them in their minuscule mean body masses if not in total length. The minuscule size and very short tail of the Myiornis pygmy tyrants often lend them a resemblance to a tiny ball or insect. The largest tyrant flycatcher is the great shrike-tyrant at 29 cm and 99.2 g. A few species such as the streamer-tailed tyrant, scissor-tailed flycatcher and <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>flycatcher</b> have a larger total length (up to 41 cm), but this is mainly due to their extremely long tails; the <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>flycatcher</b> has relatively the longest tail feathers of any known bird.|$|E
50|$|Migratory {{bird species}} include swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus), plumbeous kite (Ictinia plumbea), blue ground dove (Claravis pretiosa), dark-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus melacoryphus), white-collared swift (Streptoprocne zonaris), Sick's swift (Chaetura meridionalis), black jacobin (Florisuga fusca), black-throated mango (Anthracothorax nigricollis), white-rumped monjita (Xolmis velatus), yellow-browed tyrant (Satrapa icterophrys), rusty-margined flycatcher (Myiozetetes cayanensis), {{streaked}} flycatcher (Myiodynastes maculatus), piratic flycatcher (Legatus leucophaius), <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Tyrannus savana), white-winged becard (Pachyramphus polychopterus), red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus), lined seedeater (Sporophila lineola) and sooty grassquit (Tiaris fuliginosus).|$|E
5000|$|... 412 {{bird species}} have been identified, of which 40 are endemic to the {{southern}} Amazon and at least 26 are restricted to the Madeira - Tapajós.Endemic species include bald parrot (Pyrilia aurantiocephala) , bare-eyed antbird (Rhegmatorhina gymnops), tooth-billed wren (Odontorchilus cinereus), snow-capped manakin (Lepidothrix nattereri), Gould's toucanet (Selenidera gouldii), dark-winged trumpeter (Psophia viridis) and crimson-bellied parakeet (Pyrrhura perlata). Migratory birds include purple martin (Progne subis), barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), white-throated kingbird (Tyrannus albogularis), <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Tyrannus savana), and tropical kingbird (Tyrannus melancholicus).|$|E
50|$|Among {{the many}} non-breeding {{migrants}} {{are a variety}} of shorebirds, herons and ducks. In spring many shearwaters can be seen of the South Shore. Over 30 species of New World warbler are seen each year, with the yellow-rumped warbler being the most abundant. The arrival of many species is dependent on weather conditions; low-pressure systems moving across from North America often bring many birds to the islands. Among the rare visitors recorded are the Siberian flycatcher from Asia and the <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>flycatcher</b> and tropical kingbird from South America.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} in the Guiana Shield region, a center of endemism.The {{characteristic}} dense rainforest has many Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa) and açaí palms (Euterpe oleracea).Migratory birds include <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Tyrannus savana), great-billed hermit (Phaethornis malaris) and red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus).A quick survey near the Marinho community in the upper Cajari region recorded 15 species of non-flying mammals, 26 of flying mammals, 155 of birds, 13 of amphibians and 28 of reptiles.This almost certainly understates the true biodiversity.Another study in 2006 found 118 taxa of amphibians and reptiles.|$|E
50|$|Temperatures {{range from}} 18 to 32 C {{with an average}} of 26 C.Average annual {{rainfall}} is 2250 mm.There are three dominant vegetation types including at least 285 tree species in 55 botanical families.Most of the area is covered by open rainforest, with smaller areas of dense rainforest and savannah, the last of which have little commercial value.Migratory birds include black-tailed tityra (Tityra cayana), nacunda nighthawk (Chordeiles nacunda), band-rumped swift (Chaetura spinicaudus), <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Tyrannus savana), solitary sandpiper (Tringa solitaria), vermilion flycatcher (Pyrocephalus rubinus) and purple martin (Progne subis).|$|E
50|$|The {{black-billed magpie}} (Pica hudsonia), {{also known as}} the American magpie, is a bird in the crow family that inhabits the western half of North America, from Colorado, to {{southern}} coastal Alaska to northern California, northern Nevada, northern Arizona, northern New Mexico, central Kansas, and Nebraska. It is black and white, with black areas on the wings and tail showing iridescent hints of blue or blue-green. It is one of only four North American songbirds whose tail makes up half or more of the total body length (the others being the yellow-billed magpie, the scissor-tailed flycatcher, and the <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>flycatcher).</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{idea for}} the World Series of Birding came from Pete Dunne, one of America's {{foremost}} authors on birding and natural history, and currently {{the director of the}} Cape May Bird Observatory. The first World Series of Birding was held on May 19, 1984, and the winning team included Dunne, David Sibley (author of the renowned The Sibley Guide to Birds), Pete Bacinski (current director of the Sandy Hook Bird Observatory), Bill Boyle (author of A Guide to Bird Finding in New Jersey), and the legendary Roger Tory Peterson (inventor of the modern field guide) and was sponsored by Bird Watcher's Digest. Their total included 201 species, including a <b>fork-tailed</b> <b>flycatcher</b> - a tropical species rarely seen anywhere in the United States, let alone New Jersey.|$|E
40|$|I observed, and {{documented}} in detail, Ferruginous Pygmy Owl (Glaucidium brasilianum) predation on a mobbing <b>Fork-tailed</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> (Tyrannus savanna) in south-east Brazil. Events {{described in this}} account are supported with original photos. In addition to the predation event, I list 12 mobbing bird species that were alarmed {{by the presence of}} this raptor in the study area, including Trochilidae (Eupetomena macroura), Formicariidae (Formicivora rufa), Tyrannidae (Camptostoma obsoletum, Elaenia cristata, E. flavogaster, E. chiriquensis, T. savana, Myiarchus tyrannulus), Turdidae (Turdus leucomelas, T. amaurochalinus, T. rufiventris) and Emberizidae (Coryphospingus cucullatus). The <b>Fork-tailed</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> may represent 35 - 76. 8 % of the pygmy-owl body mass (41 - 80 g), which supports early reports about the predation on relatively large prey by this owl species. Although most authors have suggested that mobbing birds are subject to a low predation risk, this report and others confirmed that these events are not negligible and can be deadly dangerous to the mobbers, and conversely profitable to the raptor...|$|E
