500|$|In Rolling With the Stones, Bill Wyman said: [...] "On 3 August {{we worked}} on 'Good Time Woman' and when I arrived the {{following}} day I found Mick Taylor playing bass. I hung around until 3am then left." [...] In the liner notes to , Richards stated, [...] "I remember writing the riff upstairs in the very elegant front room, and we took it downstairs the same evening and we cut it." [...] Jagger said of the lyrics, [...] "It's weird where your lyric things come from. On Tumbling Dice, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> the house keeper and talked to her about gambling. She liked to play dice and I really didn't know much about it, but I got it off her and managed to make the song out of that." [...] He concluded, [...] " [...] 'Tumbling Dice' [...] " [...] was written to fit Keith's riff. It's about gambling and love, an old blues track." ...|$|E
500|$|The Slim Shady LP was {{recorded}} at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. [...] Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since {{listening to his}} group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous {{to work with him}} on the album: [...] "I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre." [...] However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. [...] The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; [...] "Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for", Eminem recalled. He later said: [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them." [...] " [...] On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished [...] "My Name Is" [...] in an hour. [...] Three other songs, including [...] "Role Model", were also recorded that day.|$|E
500|$|The sixth track, [...] "Criminal Intent" [...] {{features}} Robyn rapping, {{which was}} compared to the rapping style of musician Peaches. The song is about Robyn getting arrested for [...] "freaky dancing" [...] to her own song. Ben Norman of About.com called it [...] "a darker version of [...] previous rap songs". Comparisons were also drawn towards [...] "Fembot" [...] from Body Talk Pt. 1, and [...] "Piece of Me" [...] by Britney Spears. [...] "U Should Know Better" [...] featuring Snoop Dogg was called the album's highlight by several critics. It features Snoop Dogg rapping over an electro beat and Robyn delivering [...] "quotable, ridiculous lines", such as [...] "You know when in Rome <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> the Romans. Said we need a black Pope and she'd better be a woman." [...] Jaime Gill of BBC Music said that the song features [...] "the teen-pop singer and hip hop outlaw swapping louche quips over a relentless, grimy electro stomp." [...] The acoustic [...] "Indestructible" [...] reflects [...] "the downside of needing someone". Norman said that it [...] "is sweeping and symphonic and has so much vulnerability and strength in it that you believe she really will love {{as if she is}} indestructible." ...|$|E

60|$|Never {{probably}} since old Father Noah {{divided the}} earth among his sons had so grand a geographical discourse been delivered; and having finished, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> exhausted <b>with</b> my efforts, and mopped my brow, but glad that my huge task was over, and satisfied that I had convinced {{her of the}} futility of her wish {{to see the world}} for herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Judge," [...] he said, [...] "it isn't {{like you}} to draw hasty conclusions. Because <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to supper <b>with</b> the Gaylords it isn't fair to infer that they have {{retained}} me in a legislative case." ...|$|R
500|$|Nino, a key villain, {{is portrayed}} by Ron Perlman, {{one of the}} last actors to join the cast. Regarding the casting of Perlman, Refn said, [...] "The {{character}} of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he's done so many great films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', and I asked why, and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me." [...] Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is just released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the archetypal character into something more. He said of the role: As soon as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a bad place. By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.|$|E
2500|$|Project leader Colonel S. and {{his team}} in the Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure (Maf'at) had very little spare time, and only on the {{weekends}} could they think of an appropriate name for the system. According to Colonel S., [...] "The first name I thought of was 'Anti-Qassam', but when the project started to move forward I realized it was problematic... <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> my wife, and together we thought of suitable names. She suggested the name 'Tamir' (Hebrew acronym for טיל מיירט, Til Meyaret, 'interceptor missile') for the missile, and for the system itself we thought of 'Golden Dome'. The following Sunday, 'Tamir' was immediately approved, {{but there was a}} problem with 'Golden Dome'—it could be perceived as ostentatious. So it was changed to 'Iron Dome'." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Angel and the One" [...] {{serves as}} the album's closer. Some members of the band have claimed that this is their {{favorite}} track, including Pat Wilson. Cuomo stated that initially the song [...] "started out as a really standard pop song called 'bad girl' and had a verse and a chorus and bridge and all that stuff. And I just wasn't satisfied with it. It was too normal. So one day <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> my acoustic guitar and I just played [...] song over and over, on basically looping it. My fingers hurt so much, I just kept playing it. And over the hour that I was playing it, the song slowly evolved and it smoothed over and the sections blurred into each other. And it turned into this spiritual reverie that is really just one long [...] development without any distinction between sections." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{the release}} of the single, Walker said, [...] "Steve was drunk in the studio one night and was {{explaining}} that [...] "Forever Now" [...] is meant to be read on several different levels. But as far as knowing what those levels are and where they're leading, <b>I</b> haven't <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> him sober and got right into it."Artists to record covers of [...] "Forever Now" [...] include Pete Murray, The Delltones, The Reels and Perfect Tripod (a collaboration between Tripod and Eddie Perfect).|$|R
6000|$|I groaned. [...] "I suppose you're right," [...] I answered, [...] "but it's a {{precious}} awkward {{thing to have}} to do. However, here goes." [...] So <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> at once <b>with</b> pen, ink, and paper at my desk, to draw up this present narrative as to the real facts about the [...] "Mysterious Occurrence in Piccadilly." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> {{beside him}} <b>with</b> {{the knife in}} my hand. 'You pull both oars,' I said to Reuben; 'I'll keep guard over the fellow and see that he plays us no trick. I believe that you are right, {{and that he is}} nothing better than a pirate. He shall be given over to the justices when we get to Havant.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Following {{his release}} from Shrewsbury, Madjo opted to move abroad, signing for Chinese League One side Guangdong Sunray Cave on a free transfer. He made 18 league {{appearances}} for the club, scoring ten goals. He finished the 2009 campaign as the club's top goalscorer, and fifth in the overall goalscoring charts. The following season, Madjo signed for Albanian Superliga side KS Bylis Ballsh. He made his debut for the club in a 3–2 defeat to KS Vllaznia Shkodër on 22 August 2010, playing the whole 90 minutes. Madjo scored his first goal for the club on 30 October 2010, netting in the first minute of the match as Bylis beat Besa Kavajë 3–1. He also scored a last minute winner in the club's 3–2 home win against Shkumbini Peqin in November 2010. Madjo was given a straight red card in the club's 2–1 defeat to KS Kastrioti on 24 December 2010. It was to be Madjo's last game for Bylis. He later said that [...] "I felt that Bylis Ballsh did not respect my contract so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> the club and cancelled my contract." [...] He made a total of 15 appearances for the Albanian side, scoring twice.|$|E

Described as a "vibrant and active shared space in a central campus location," the Commons will occupy most of {{the first floor of the}} East Tower and be home to a suite of technologies and services that support new and traditional modes of scholarship. <b>I</b> recently <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> Julie Bobay, Associate Dean for Collection Development and Scholarly Communication and Chair of the Scholars’ Commons Task Force, to discuss how the Commons will change library services at Indiana University...|$|R
5000|$|Phil Labonte and {{producer}} Josh Wilbur wrote the lyrics for the album together, {{which is the}} first time in All That Remains catalogue. Phil Labonte stated about working with Josh: [...] "Honestly, the test for me is, like, when me and Josh got done, 'cause we wrote the melodies and the lyrics together; none of the vocals were done before <b>I</b> actually <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> Josh. This is the first time that anyone has ever had any kind of input onto lyrics. But Josh is the only guy that's actually worked with me about lyrics and stuff, and it's been completely wonderful." [...] A music video was made for 'This Probably Won't End Well'.|$|R

[126] [Compare Coleridge's reflections, in {{his diary}} for April 19, 1804, on {{entering}} the Straits of Gibraltar: [...] "When <b>I</b> first <b>sat</b> <b>down,</b> <b>with</b> Europe on my left and Africa on my right, both distinctly visible, I felt a quickening of the movements in the blood, but still felt it as a pleasure of amusement rather than of thought and elevation; {{and at the same}} time, and gradually winning on the other, the nameless silent forms of nature were working in me, like a tender thought in a man who is hailed merrily by some acquaintance in his work, and answers it in the same tone" [...] (Anima Poetæ, 1895, pp. 70, 71).] ...|$|R

60|$|Drawing a chair into a recess, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> folded hands, calmly {{awaiting}} {{the arrival of}} my master.

60|$|Such was {{the wild}} {{nightmare}} begot by my first {{impression of the}} Encantadas tortoise. But next evening, strange to say, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> my shipmates, and made a merry repast from tortoise steaks, and tortoise stews; and supper over, out knife, and helped convert the three mighty concave shells into three fanciful soup-tureens, and polished the three flat yellowish calipees into three gorgeous salvers.|$|E
60|$|Whilst I {{stood by}} the window it came to pass than a very tall, indifferently apparelled gentleman issued from the hostelry and halted for some moments in {{conversation}} with the ostler below. He walked with an enfeebled step, and leaned heavily for support upon a stout cane. As he turned to reenter the inn I had {{a glimpse of a}} face woefully pale, about which, as about the man's whole figure, there was a something that was familiar--a something that puzzled me, and on which my mind was still dwelling when presently <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to breakfast <b>with</b> Castelroux.|$|R
6000|$|As a brain {{merchant}} I was a success. Society {{opened its}} portals to me. I entered right {{in on the}} parlour floor, and my disillusionment proceeded rapidly. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to dinner <b>with</b> the masters of society, and with the wives and daughters of the masters of society. The women were gowned beautifully, I admit; but to my naive surprise I discovered that they were of the same clay as {{all the rest of}} the women I had known down below in the cellar. [...] "The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady were sisters under their skins"--and gowns.|$|R
60|$|The {{moment the}} woman {{was out of my}} house, I sent a {{telegram}} to Philip to say that he might expect to see me that night. I caught the last train in the evening; and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to supper <b>with</b> those two harmless young creatures, knowing I must prepare the husband for what threatened them, and weakly deferring it, when I found myself in their presence, until the next day. Eunice was, in some degree, answerable for this hesitation on my part. No one could look at her husband, and fail to see that he was a supremely happy man. But I detected signs of care in the wife's face.|$|R
6000|$|The {{opportunity}} that the day's rest {{had given me}} for reflection had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting Compeyson.

60|$|On {{the fourth}} there {{came to the}} gate one who had served with me abroad, {{accompanied}} by a brother officer of his whom I had never seen. I felt that I {{could not bear to}} be {{out of sight of the}} place. It was a summer evening, and I bade my people take a table and a flask of wine into the garden. Then <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>WITH</b> MY CHAIR UPON THE GRAVE, and being assured that nobody could disturb it now without my knowledge, tried to drink and talk.|$|E
5000|$|Matt Mullins as Johnny Cage, {{a former}} movie star that became an {{undercover}} agent after his Hollywood career died. In a short flashback, he is killed by Baraka. When asked {{about how he}} got involved in the project, Mullins said: [...] "I had known Kevin Tancharoen for about five years, but I {{never had a chance}} to work with him. A few months ago I got a call from Kevin about being involved in a short that he was planning to shoot. He sent me the script and I was blown away.

500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|R
60|$|Now that I have {{finished}} {{the account of}} the last of the series of unsuccessful attempts which were made to find the will, I must hurry over the subsequent events of my life in a much briefer and more concise way. It is now nearly six years since Robert Gregory died, and I must content myself with a mere sketch of what has taken place in that time; for this my history has already spun out to a most unreasonable length, many times surpassing the limits I proposed to myself when <b>I</b> first <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> the intention of writing it. But my pen has run on and on, as I recalled all the past events of my life; and I feel every day, when I see the mass of manuscript which has accumulated in my drawer--for my desk has long since been too small to contain its growing bulk--that the chances that any one will ever take the trouble to read it through, are growing fainter and fainter every day.|$|R
6000|$|Except for a {{luxuriance}} {{of grass}} and ferns, and two babbling streams of water, our old camp ground had not changed. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> mingled emotions. How familiarly beautiful and lonely this canyon glade! The great pines and spruces looked down upon me with a benediction. How serene, passionless, strong they seemed! It was only men who changed in brief time. The long year of worry and dread and toil and pain had passed. It was nothing. On the soft, fragrant, pine-scented breeze came a whispering of welcome from the forestland: [...] "You are here again. Live now--in the present." ...|$|E
60|$|All the rages I {{had ever}} been in {{before in my life}} were as nothing {{compared}} with the rage that devoured me when I had read that fourth page of Mrs. Finch's letter. Nugent had got the better of me and my precautions! Nugent had robbed his brother of Lucilla, in the vilest manner, with perfect impunity! I cast all feminine restraints to the winds. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> my legs anyhow, like a man. I rammed my hands into the pockets of my dressing-gown. Did I cry?

But on this point I can give your reverence no satisfaction; for, besides the obscurity of the apartment, and the fluttered state of my own nerves, I seemed to myself overwhelmed {{by a sense of}} filial awe, which prevented my noting and recording what it is probable the personage before me might most desire to have concealed. Indeed, his figure was so closely veiled and wimpled, either with a mantle, morning-gown, or some such loose garb, that the verses of Spenser might well have been applied-- ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was late}} before {{we thought of}} getting dinner.

I was so greedy of her nearness that <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to dinner <b>with</b> my lass upon my knee, made sure of her with one hand, and ate with the other. Ay, and more than that. She was the worst cook I suppose God made; the things she set her hand to it would have sickened an honest horse to eat of; yet I made my meal that day on Uma’s cookery, and can never call to mind to have been better pleased.|$|R
50|$|Hobby’s {{interest}} in the union was duly noted, and he was soon elected President of the plant’s night shift. Hobby’s tenure was short-lived, however, because he was called back into the U.S. Navy in 1950 during the Korean War. He served for 18 months. During this time period, Hobby’s opinion on racial issues began to take on their mature form. During the Korean War, Blacks {{were not required to}} eat at separate tables from whites (President Truman legally desegregated the armed forces in 1948). Despite his expectations of an awful experience, Hobby decided to sit with two Blacks one day. Reflecting back on the experience years later, Hobby said, “I was visibly surprised when I didn't feel any physical pain. I was … twenty-five years old and expecting physical pain just because <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and ate <b>with</b> them”.|$|R
60|$|I {{was glad}} enough when I reached {{my room and}} locked out the mold and the darkness. A cheery fire was burning in the grate, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> before it <b>with</b> a comforting sense of relief. For two hours <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> there, {{thinking}} of bygone times; recalling old scenes, and summoning half-forgotten faces out of the mists of the past; listening, in fancy, to voices that long ago grew silent for all time, and to once familiar songs that nobody sings now. And as my reverie softened down to a sadder and sadder pathos, the shrieking of the winds outside softened to a wail, the angry beating of the rain against the panes diminished to a tranquil patter, {{and one by one}} the noises in the street subsided, until the hurrying footsteps of the last belated straggler died away in the distance and left no sound behind.|$|R
