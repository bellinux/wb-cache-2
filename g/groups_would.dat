5|$|On 13 September 1911, Scott {{revealed}} {{his plans for}} the South Pole march. Sixteen men would set out, using the two remaining motor sledges, ponies and dogs for the Barrier stage of the journey, which would bring them to the Beardmore Glacier. At this point the dogs would return to base and the ponies would be shot for food. Thereafter, twelve men in three <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> ascend the glacier and begin the crossing of the polar plateau, using man-hauling. Only one of these <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> carry on to the pole; the supporting <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> be sent back at specified latitudes. The composition of the final polar group would be decided by Scott during the journey. For the return journey, Scott ordered that the dogs teams set off again from the base camp to replenish depots and meet the Polar party between latitude 82 and 82.30 on 1 March to assist the party home.|$|E
5|$|A {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} electron affinity going down <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> be expected. The additional electron will be entering an orbital {{farther away from}} the nucleus. As such this electron would be less attracted to the nucleus and would release less energy when added. However, in going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, {{this is due to the}} poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Farke and {{his colleagues}} in 2014 {{published}} {{a description of a}} new neoceratopsian, Aquilops americanus, through the peer-reviewed science journal PLOS ONE. They analysed their taxa as well as most other primitive ceratopsians to get a consensus cladogram. They created their own data matrix and through it found that many groups of ceratopsians could be supported, and that Aquilops was a basal neoceratopsian that could potentially be a protoceratopsid, leptoceratopsid, or ceratopsid, although any one of these <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> have a large ghost lineage with Aquilops.|$|E
50|$|The eight invited {{teams were}} {{split into two}} groups that played a {{round-robin}} tournament. On completion of this, the fourth placed teams in each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> play each other to determine seventh and eighth place, the third placed teams in each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> play each other to decide fifth and sixth place, the second placed teams in each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> play to determine third and fourth place and the winners of each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> compete for first and second place overall.|$|R

5000|$|... 12 {{teams were}} grouped into 3 groups of 4 teams each, where each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> consist {{of home and}} away {{round-robin}} tournament. The winners of each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> qualify to the finals.|$|R
5|$|The priory was {{elevated}} {{to the status}} of abbey by Pope Leo XIII in 1894, and the monks founded a school for lay monks to help build a self-sustaining source of revenue. Failing to attract a single prospective applicant in over seven years, they expanded enrollment to students with no intention of joining the clergy. The two <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> eventually be taught separately, and the monastic students were trained to become priests fluent in Bohemian, German, and English and prepared to preach to ethnically diverse congregations. Lay students were trained for employment in the business world.|$|E
5|$|With the {{publication}} of the accreditation procedures for organisations to access ContactPoint, {{it became clear that the}} vast majority of voluntary organisations would not have been able to access ContactPoint. This meant that the majority of organisations that work with children or young people e.g. sports groups, uniformed groups and faith <b>groups,</b> <b>would</b> not be able to register their involvement, representing a real challenge for practitioners who wanted to see who was working with a particular child or young person.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s Indiana's Republican party, whose adherents {{tended to}} favor the temperance movement, began {{challenging}} the state's Democrats, who supported personal freedom and a limited federal government, for political power. Early temperance legislation in Indiana earned only limited and temporary success. In 1853 Republicans persuaded the state legislature to pass a local option law that would allow township voters to declare their township dry, but it was later deemed unconstitutional. In 1855 a statewide prohibition law was passed, but it met the same fate as the local option. In the decades to come Protestant churches, especially the Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Disciples of Christ, Quakers, and women's <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> continue to support temperance efforts and gave strong support to the mostly dry Republican Party. The Catholics, Episcopalians and Lutherans stood opposed and gave strong support to the wet Democratic Party.|$|E

On completion of this, the third placed teams in each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> play each other to decide fifth and sixth place, the second placed teams in each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> play to determine third and fourth place and the winners of each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> compete for first and second place overall.|$|R
50|$|SPWA {{produces}} and acquires {{about 60}} films per year, usually through Stage 6 Films, Affirm Films, and Destination Films. Most films of SPWA would go straight-to-video, but the <b>group</b> <b>would</b> also release few of its films theatrically; the <b>group</b> <b>would</b> analyze {{how much a}} theatrical release would impact a film's TV, VOD and home video revenue, and then the <b>group</b> <b>would</b> determine whether the film should bows theatrically.|$|R
5000|$|... 24 {{teams were}} grouped into 6 groups of 4 teams each, where each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> consist {{of home and}} away {{round-robin}} tournament. The winners and runners-up of each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> advance to the final stage.|$|R
5|$|Even as {{the initial}} 400 gliders were being produced, several {{problems}} with the Hotspur's design were uncovered, the primary one being that the glider did not carry sufficient troops. Although it had been designed to transport eight airborne troops and a cargo of , this {{was found to be}} inadequate. Tactically it was believed that airborne troops should be landed in groups far larger than eight, and the number of aircraft therefore required to tow the gliders needed to land larger <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> be unfeasible; there were also concerns that the gliders would have to be towed in tandem if used operationally, which would be extremely difficult during nighttime and through cloud formations. Its disappointing glide ratio was also a contributing factor to reevaluate the assault glider concept.|$|E
5|$|In many cases, {{large groups}} of {{immigrant}} Han would unite under a common surname to form a brotherhood. Brotherhoods were used {{as a form of}} defense, as each sworn brother was bound by an oath of blood to assist a brother in need. The brotherhood <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> link their names to a family tree, in essence manufacturing a genealogy based on names rather than blood, and taking the place of the kinship organizations commonly found in China. The practice was so widespread that today's family books are largely unreliable. Many Plains Aborigines joined the brotherhoods to gain protection of the collective as a type of insurance policy against regional strife, and through these groups they took on a Han identity with a Han lineage.|$|E
5|$|Politics in Belgium under Leopold I were {{polarized}} between {{liberal and}} Catholic political factions, though before 1847 they collaborated in unionist governments. The liberals {{were opposed to}} the church and particularly opposed its influence in politics and society, while supporting free trade, personal liberties and secularization. The Catholics saw religious teachings as a fundamental basis for the state and society and opposed all attempts by the liberals to attack the church's official privileges. Initially, these factions existed only as informal groups with which prominent politicians were generally identified. The liberals held power over much of Leopold I's reign. An official Liberal Party was formed in 1846, although a formal Catholic Party was only established in 1869. Gradually, these political <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> also spread into Belgium's society, creating a process of social stratification known as pillarisation. Leopold, who was Protestant, tended to favor Liberals and shared their desire for reform, though he was not partisan.|$|E
50|$|In the Second Round, the 30 {{teams were}} divided in 5 groups of 6 teams each. Teams in each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> play {{against each other}} in a home-and-away basis. The team with most points in each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> qualify to the World Cup.|$|R
5000|$|... 25 {{teams were}} grouped into 8 groups, where each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> consist {{of home and}} away {{round-robin}} tournament. The winners of each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> qualify to the second round. One group was consist of 4 teams, and the other 7 groups were each consist of 3 teams.|$|R
50|$|In the Third Round of CONCACAF, the 12 {{winners of}} the Second Round were divided in 3 groups of 4 teams each. Teams in each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> play against each other home-and-away, and the two teams with most points in each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> advance to the Fourth Round.|$|R
5|$|Within {{some of the}} {{destroyed}} suburbs, {{a limited}} postal system between various Robinson groups was established. Dawid Landau {{had served as a}} bodyguard to the courier of the Polish government in exile, Jan Karski, while Karski secretly entered the ghetto to gather information for a report on the extermination of Polish Jews by Nazi Germany for the Western allies, in 1943. Later, Landau fought in both of the Warsaw uprising as part of Żydowski Związek Wojskowy (Jewish Military Union, ŻZW) and afterward decided to stay in the ruins. In his memoirs he reports that the post functioned through the use of empty electrical socket boxes. Various <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> leave notes for others informing them of who was alive and in hiding, news from the front that had been obtained, as well as requests for special forms of assistance. According to Landau, the most common pleas were for doctors or other forms of medical help.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication in Sabah and Sarawak were {{originally}} administered by Posts and Telecommunication Department until 1967, and {{maintained by the}} British Cable & Wireless Communications before all telecommunications management in the state been takeover by Peninsular-based company. The British telecommunication company have establish a submarine cable that linking Kota Kinabalu with Singapore and Hong Kong. Following {{the expansion of the}} Peninsular-based company on 1 January 1968, Sabah Posts and Telecommunication Department was merged with the Peninsular telecommunication department to formed Telecommunications Department Malaysia. All operations under Telecommunications Department Malaysia was then transferred to Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Berhad (STM) which become a public listed company in 1991 with the federal government retained a majority shareholding. There are also other telecommunication companies operating in the state although only providing cellular phone facilities. In 2006, the state has the lowest Direct Exchange Line (DEL) penetration rate, with cellular and internet dial-up penetrations rate only 6.5 per 100 inhabitants. Most residents from the low income <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> rather use mobile phones internet or use internet at their offices instead of setting up internet access at home as the Malaysian main internet provider of Telekom Malaysia were unable to build high speed low cost internet due to the high cost of equipment which are mostly sourced from abroad. Until the end of 2014, there were only 934 telecommunication hotspots in Sabah. Due to this, the government are working to increase the penetration and capability of internet connection as well {{to bridge the gap between}} Sabah and the Peninsular. The mobile telecommunications in Sabah are mostly use 4G and 3G and there is free rural Wi-Fi services provided by the federal government known as the Kampung Tanpa Wayar 1Malaysia (KTW) although Malaysia's public internet speeds are among the slower than many other countries.|$|E
5|$|The brigade's {{other two}} battalions, the 12th and 13th, were also were also badly {{scattered}} {{when they were}} dropped at 00:50. When both units moved away from their rendezvous points neither had more than sixty percent of their strength, although individual airborne troops and small <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> join the battalions throughout the day. Both of the battalions had been tasked with securing the area around DZ N and the two bridges captured by the coup-de-main force, a task which was made much more difficult by being scattered throughout the area. The 12th Parachute Battalion's mission was to secure the village of Le Bas de Ranville, which it did so by 04:00. The 13th Parachute Battalion was to capture the town of Ranville, which it achieved {{around the same time}} albeit against heavier resistance than that encountered by the other battalion. One company from 13th Parachute Battalion was detailed to remain at the battalion drop-zone in order to provide protection for a company of sappers. The latter were to demolish the poles and explosives that were present in the area, so that the 6th Airborne Division headquarters could land safely. The two battalions held their respective areas until relieved by ground forces advancing from the beaches. The 12th Parachute Battalion was bombarded with heavy mortar and artillery fire, and repelled two German counter-attacks by the 125th Panzer Grenadier Regiment; the first was defeated after destroying a tank and taking a number of prisoners, and the second was repulsed {{with the help of an}} air-landed anti-tank battery which had recently arrived.|$|E
50|$|The 12 {{winners of}} the first stage {{advanced}} to the second stage, where they were divided into three groups of four teams each. Teams in each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> play against each other home-and-away, and the two teams with most points in each <b>group</b> <b>would</b> advance to the Final Round.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} {{mortgages}} could create 4 different classes of bonds. The first <b>group</b> <b>would</b> receive any prepayments {{before the second}} <b>group</b> <b>would,</b> and so on. Thus the first <b>group</b> of bonds <b>would</b> be expected to pay off sooner, but would also have a lower interest rate. Thus a 30-year mortgage is transformed into bonds of various lengths suitable for various investors with various goals.|$|R

5|$|To ensure {{constant}} air support, Jagdgeschwader (Fighter Wings) and Nachtjagdgeschwader (Night Fighter Wings) in {{the shape}} of Nachtjagdgeschwader 1, were ordered to achieve a frantic pace in servicing and preparing aircraft for their next mission. To keep a constant aerial vigil over the task force, the 'black men' (mechanics) had to complete rearming and refuelling in 30 minutes or less. Galland insisted that the air units aircraft should be split between high and low altitude to provide sound cover. The low altitude <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> be able to evade detection by British coastal radar. Galland demanded an umbrella of at least 16 fighters over the ships at any one time along the whole length of the channel. The fighter group would be split into two groups of eight aircraft for their respective patrol altitudes. Each formation was split into two Schwärme of four aircraft. The Schwärme tactics involved one formation flying to sea and one to land in a zigzag pattern. All Schwärme were ordered to fly back and forth along the line of ships in wide figures of eight while maintaining radio silence. Every sortie was meticulously timed to allow the fighters exactly 30 minutes over the ships, enough to maintain cover and allow the relieved units to refuel and rearm and return to start the cycle again. However, during Donnerkeil, the relieving sortie would arrive after only 20 minutes which meant the actual fighter cover for half the dash would be 32 fighters.|$|E

25|$|The {{migration}} hypothesis {{proposed by}} Brinkman {{and the others}} was that centrosaurs bred near the coast and reared their young in small family groups. These <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> then migrate toward the west {{in order to avoid}} seasonal hazards like storms or to exploit seasonally available resources in that direction. As the migration progressed the family <b>groups</b> <b>would</b> gradually merge, becoming large herds, which may have protected them from predators on the journey. Eberth, Brinkman, and Barkas noted that Hilda is located roughly halfway between the ancient coast and the Dinosaur Provincial Park bonebeds.|$|E

50|$|In March 2012, Providence Equity Partners {{began to}} explore {{strategic}} alternatives for Newport Television, which {{may lead to}} a sale of the group. In July 2012, it was officially confirmed that Nexstar Broadcasting <b>Group</b> <b>would</b> acquire twelve of Newport's stations, Sinclair Broadcast <b>Group</b> <b>would</b> acquire six, and Cox Media <b>Group</b> <b>would</b> acquire four. As part of the same deal, Newport's CMS operations, branded as Inergize Digital, would go to Nexstar. This deal was followed eight days later by the announcement that WXXA-TV in Albany, New York would be sold to Shield Media, LLC, who would then enter into joint sales and shared services agreements with Young Broadcasting's WTEN.|$|R
50|$|H.R. 4263 would {{direct the}} Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to {{establish}} a working group to provide guidance and best practices {{on the use of}} social media technologies, specifically during a terrorist attack or other emergency.
