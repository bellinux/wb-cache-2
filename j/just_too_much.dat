25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> The hurt that remains is that I tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} scene of the episode, when Jon Snow arises from the table, Weiss stated that [...] "Jon coming back to life was {{something}} in the first, first version we wrote originally had more talking. And as we saw it on the page written out, we realized it was <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> dialogue, we decided to just give the kind of awe of that moment its due." ...|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1977, bassist Mark Evans was fired; purportedly to {{find someone}} who could sing backup vocals. Evans {{described}} disagreement with Angus and Malcolm as a contributing factor. He was replaced by Cliff Williams. Neither of the Young brothers has elaborated on the departure of Evans, though Richard Griffiths, the CEO of Epic Records and a booking agent for AC/DC in the mid-1970s, later commented, [...] "You knew Mark wasn't going to last, he was <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a nice guy." [...] Mark Evans' autobiography, DIRTY DEEDS: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC, released in 2011, predominantly dealt with his time in AC/DC, including being fired.|$|E
500|$|Indestructible did, however, receive criticism. IGN writer Jim Kaz {{proposes that}} vocalist David Draiman has an [...] "overly-forced" [...] vocal delivery. Kaz also finds, [...] "The tunes are largely similar {{in style and}} {{structure}} ... In essence, there's very little that stands out." [...] He {{goes on to say}} that the album already seems obsolete, [...] "There's <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of the very recent past on Indestructible to move away from it. So in effect, it sounds a bit dated ... already." [...] It is also suggested that, although possessing a reliably solid foundation, the album lacks a meaning behind its drive: [...] "They wind up sounding a little lost on Indestructible, stabbing their weapons without any reasons behind each parry," [...] says PopMatters writer Andrew Blackie.|$|E
500|$|GameSpy {{reviewer}} Phil Theobald, who {{awarded the}} games {{four out of}} five stars, stated, [...] "Before I knew it, I was hooked all over again. The engrossingly simple gameplay combined with the more-strategic-than-they-first-appear battles was <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to resist. And yeah, the 'gotta catch 'em all' gimmick is still effective, not to mention necessary to build a well balanced party. There's just something about tracking down, capturing, and training all those Pokémon that really draw you into the game's world." [...] He justified the games' graphics by comparing them to the [...] "ugly" [...] original Red and Blue versions. Additional praise was given to the new features such as the contextual tutorial, and flashbacks when loading a saved game, as well as the games' multiplayer capabilities via the Wireless adapter.|$|E
5000|$|Hlavacek {{described}} his motivation {{in an interview}} in 1952: [...] "Today's world is <b>just</b> <b>too</b> real, <b>too</b> <b>much</b> with us, so I like to deal with what some might term unreality." ...|$|R

Nick is sensitive and thoughtful with actors and {{he tries to}} respect the status and dignity of everyone on the set, but sometimes the frustration <b>just</b> gets <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> Nicks surname Reve is derived from and pronounced like the French word rêve, meaning dream.|$|R
500|$|Chris Young's {{streak of}} 25 {{consecutive}} road starts without a loss was broken that {{day by the}} Dodgers win. The only other pitcher in major league baseball history had gone as many as 25 straight road starts without losing — Allie Reynolds had a 25-game streak in –. [...] "I was terrible," [...] Young said. [...] "I just never found my rhythm and never found my groove. I put the guys in a hole {{early in the game}} and it was <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to overcome. I can’t imagine, having to go through that, the courage it took, the discipline, and just how successful he was. I mean, he wasn’t just successful integrating the game. He was a great baseball player. He's a Hall of Fame baseball player. He wouldn’t allow himself to fail, and that's tremendous." ...|$|E
500|$|On 18 October, The Sun {{reported}} that McGuire {{had left the}} band. At a reception when Ayers Rock returned to Australia, he said: [...] "The pressure of the tour was <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> We {{were on the road}} all the time and I guess I wasn't as strong {{as the rest of the}} band. When we got into the studio I had the shakes. I mean I was playing the right notes, but not in the right places." [...] To finish the album McGuire's friend Les Young played some of the bass guitar parts, and American Jeff Castleman played bass on [...] "Catchanemu". Young also briefly played live with Ayers Rock in Australia, including an October 1975 show at the State Theatre in Sydney. McGuire returned to the group at the Dallas Brooks Hall on 21 October 1975, to warm applause.|$|E
500|$|Ross Bonaime of Paste wrote: [...] "As {{great as}} {{an episode of}} Bob's Burgers can be when {{the kids and the}} adults are given their own {{separate}} stories... there's something much more rewarding about a storyline that combines the two groups in an almost Simpson-ian manner." [...] He also praised the episode's guest voice actors, citing in particular Bill Hader's character Mickey as [...] "very odd, but so much fun"; Bonaime gave [...] "Bob Fires the Kids" [...] an overall grade of 8.3 out of 10. Jen Johnson, writing for Den of Geek, also cited Mickey as a highlight of the episode, stating: [...] "I would say that I hope {{this is the end of}} Mickey and the chaos he brings to the Belcher family, but [...] was <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fun. I hope he comes back." ...|$|E

50|$|The ports {{received}} modest to poor reviews at {{the time}} with the general consensus nowadays being that the 8-Bit versions were just money grabs as a decent conversion would have been near impossible from the outset given the hardware limitations {{and that there was}} <b>just</b> far <b>too</b> <b>much</b> missing from the ports on the higher spec machines such as the Amiga and Atari ST.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{received}} a B rating from The A.V. Clubs Dan Caffrey, though {{he stated that}} [...] "It was rushed, it was messy, {{and it may have}} been <b>just</b> a bit <b>too</b> <b>much</b> story for South Park, even for a two-parter." ...|$|R
500|$|Discussing Mateiu Caragiale's originality, Călinescu saw in him [...] "a {{promoter}} (maybe the first) {{of literary}} Balkanism, that greasy mix of obscene phrases, lascivious impulses, awareness of an adventurous and fuzzy genealogy, everything purified and seen from above by a superior intelligence". In relation to Romanian literature, he {{believed to have}} discovered a common trait of [...] "Balkan" [...] writers of mostly Wallachian origin, citing Mateiu Caragiale in a group that also included Caragiale-father, the early 19th century aphorist and printer Anton Pann, the modern poets Tudor Arghezi, Ion Minulescu and Ion Barbu, and Urmuz. He went on to define this gathering as [...] "the great grimacing sensitive ones, buffoons with <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> plastic intelligence." [...] In parallel, Lovinescu saw Caragiale as one {{in a group of}} modernist prose writers who sought to reshape the genre through the use of lyricism, and were thus paradoxically outdated by 20th century standards. The delayed character of Caragiale's contribution was also mentioned by literary historian Ovid Crohmălniceanu, who identified its roots in Art Nouveau and, through it, the subjects of Byzantine art.|$|E
500|$|One {{frequently}} criticised {{aspect of}} the game was its low and inconsistent frame rate. According to Trigger Happy author Steven Poole, [...] "The game's inadequate temporal resolution—owing to a wrongheaded choice to privilege visual detail over frame-rate—made it unplayable at higher difficulty levels." [...] In contrast, IGN {{pointed out that the}} frame rate [...] "can be sluggish in certain wide-open areas or when there are lots of enemies on-screen, but for some odd reason it's never really bothersome. Most of the time you're so caught up in the game that you don't notice it, and when you do, you're willing to forgive it as Perfect Dark is <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fun to dwell on such an issue". Poole also described the [...] "lazy sci-fi fetishism" [...] of Joanna Dark's character design as [...] "a blatant and doomed attempt to steal the thunder of Lara Croft", and argued that she illustrated the challenges of characterising the protagonists of first-person shooters, a problem that GoldenEye 007 had avoided by using the already well-known character James Bond.|$|E
500|$|Along with Jim Miller's {{opinions}} in Rolling Stone magazine, Woffinden's 1974 album review for the NME {{was one of}} the most scathing critiques. Woffinden bemoaned how on Dark Horse, [...] "the radiant light of George's spirituality is planted firmly under a bushel and darkness is not confined to equine matters". He then wrote of the song: [...] " [...] seems to have most chance of independent survival, especially as the song turned up in quite pleasant shape on Wood's I've Got My Own Album To Do, but here again the production effectively smothers it, and Harrison's drab vocals complete the assassination." [...] By contrast, Michael Gross of Circus Raves magazine viewed the album as the equal of Harrison's acclaimed All Things Must Pass (1970) and praised the song and its arrangement, writing: [...] "Scott again excels on 'Far East Man', with a horn solo that would vindicate any context in which it was put." [...] In a similarly positive assessment for Melody Maker, Brian Harrigan opined that Dark Horse [...] "should certainly do a tremendous amount to salvage George's battered reputation" [...] but found the extended playout to [...] "Far East Man" [...] overlong – an example, he said, where [...] "you can have <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a good thing".|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, I {{am going}} to be my own maid for a while. I expect I do appear a very {{helpless}} individual, but really I do not feel so. Perhaps I have had <b>just</b> a little <b>too</b> <b>much</b> waiting on." ...|$|R
5000|$|On a less {{positive}} note, Jamie Parmenter from Renowned for Sound gave a mixed {{review and}} said that [...] "despite the often predictable big choruses {{in most of the}} songs, the tracks are well thought out and work in their own right, it's <b>just</b> there’s <b>too</b> <b>much</b> unoriginality." [...] and called it a [...] "safe album" [...] in which [...] "Colbie almost seems scared to try something new and different".|$|R
5000|$|Neil Gaiman, with artist John Romita, Jr., {{created a}} 2006 miniseries, which helped bring the Eternals' {{role in the}} modern Marvel Universe up-to-date. Originally {{solicited}} as a six-issue series, an extra issue {{was added to the}} run, because, according to editor Nick Lowe, [...] "There was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> story to fit into the structure we set for ourselves. Neil was starting issue five and told me that he might need a seventh issue. He <b>just</b> had <b>too</b> <b>much</b> story to fit in six issues (even with the first and sixth double-sized)." ...|$|R
500|$|As on Mos Def's other albums, {{he spoke}} a {{dedication}} to God in Arabic ("Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Raheem") {{at the start}} of The Ecstatic, before [...] "Supermagic" [...] began with a sample of Malcolm X's 1964 speech at Oxford Union. The sample prefaced the album's [...] "small-globe statement", Pitchfork journalist Nate Patrin explained, indicating that Mos Def had [...] "a stake in something greater than just one corner of the rap world". Alex Young from Consequence of Sound believed the speech introduced [...] "a political album encompassing global beats and viewpoints". According to Washington Post critic Allison Stewart, Mos Def seemed equally interested in the Obama-era zeitgeist and accounts of the past, such as the early-1980s Bedford–Stuyvesant setting of [...] "Life in Marvelous Times". Young deemed the song anthemic for [...] "a seemingly paradoxical age that routinely sees events such as a Black man being elected president of a nation wallowing in racial inequality". From Christgau's perspective, Mos Def offered a credo in the lyrics: [...] "More of less than ever before / It's <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> more for your mind to absorb / It's scary like hell, but there's no doubt / We can't be alive in no time but now".|$|E
500|$|Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar praised Trevor {{for being}} the first {{character}} in the series that [...] "makes sense". He stated that, upon their first playthrough of a Grand Theft Auto game, most players [...] "carjacked some poor schlub, then started doing 90mph on the sidewalk, mowing over civilians", as opposed to playing peacefully. [...] "Trevor's existence isn't a commentary on any group of people–he's just the first logical fit to the way people have been playing GTA games for the past decade," [...] he said. Sullivan concluded that Trevor {{is one of the}} few protagonists in the Grand Theft Auto that would willingly execute popular player actions, such as murder and violence. Trevor has been compared to many other characters in video games and films. Calvin Khan of IGN compared Trevor to Heath Ledger's Joker in the 2008 film The Dark Knight. Khan felt that Trevor is the only character in Grand Theft Auto V not trying to fake his persona, stating [...] "Trevor absolutely knows that he's a monster but just doesn't care. He enjoys causing misery and harm, lives for it and embraces it and – much like Heath Ledger's Joker – he exists purely for unadulterated anarchy." [...] He also felt that Trevor's only reasoning for hurting people and messing everything up around him is simply because it's <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> fun not to. Khan concluded saying that it's clear that the world through the eyes of Trevor is already royally broken and he sees no harm in messing it up some more, hence the reason for Trevor's actions.|$|E
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Time Out Sydney {{felt that}} the album is unfortunately Brian Eno's new album rather than U2's: [...] "for all that's new, there's no way that you'll mistake it for another band." [...] Pitchfork Media reviewer Ryan Dombal gave a score of 4.2 out of 10, stating, [...] "the album's ballyhooed experimentation is either terribly misguided or hidden underneath a wash of shameless U2-isms." [...] Kaj Roth of Melodic magazine described it as [...] "more electronic and less rock" [...] and stating {{that part of the}} album [...] "reminds <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of their early 90's records". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun gave a rating of three and a half stars, comparing it to the 1990s albums Zooropa, Pop, and Original Soundtracks 1 while stating [...] "This is no blockbuster... It's the least immediate U2 album in years, but one that diehard fans will enjoy living with". Madeleine Chong of MTV Asia wrote that, [...] "Although U2 should be lauded for their efforts at constant reinvention and pushing the envelope in the rock genre, [...] possesses neither the iconic qualities of The Joshua Tree or the radical yet relevant magnetism of Achtung Baby." [...] Toronto Star music critic Ben Rayner called the songs boring, adding that the ambience introduced by Eno and Lanois was [...] "often all these vague, hook-deficient songs have going for them." [...] Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice gave the album a mixed review and wrote that its songs [...] "will remind you of other, much better songs, but in a way that only makes you want to go and listen to those other songs instead." [...] Time magazine also gave it an unfavourable review, calling the effort [...] "unsatisfied" [...] and [...] "mostly restless, tentative and confused." ...|$|E

50|$|Despite {{not being}} a major {{commercial}} success, the film was well received critically. In fact, several critics claim {{it is one of}} Murray's finest performances: a jaded man who has <b>just</b> had <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of The Big Apple. Also praised were the strong performances by the supporting cast, particularly Robards as the police chief Rotzinger, who, while almost as burned out as Murray, is still determined to capture the robbers as a swan song to his long career.|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire that appeared in early August 2016, Eastwood discussed Donald Trump and how this generation, as he put it, is a [...] "pussy generation." [...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's not so good. And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion {{on the fact that the}} guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He's said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he was a little bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> funny business on both sides of the aisle. She's made a lot of dough out of being a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. I'm sure that Ronald Reagan gave up dough to be a politician." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Connery {{received}} the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award on 8 June 2006, he confirmed his retirement from acting.

However, with the required run rate at 7.87 runs when Miandad fell, there was <b>just</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> {{for the upcoming}} batsmen to do, and Pakistan lost 6/99 as they were bowled all out for 249 (all out, 49 overs) ...|$|E
