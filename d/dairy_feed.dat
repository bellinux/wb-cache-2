5000|$|Bangladesh Dairy Feed: Land {{is scarce}} in this densely {{populated}} and disaster prone country and therefore, grazing land for livestock is shrinking day by day. Also, due to poor genetic potential of milking cows coupled with non-availability of balanced supplemental feed, {{the national average}} milk production in Bangladesh has remained very low (in the range of 1.5-3.0 liters per cow per day). In this backdrop, F2F volunteer Dr. Roy Chapin helped to develop the first <b>dairy</b> <b>feed</b> program in Bangladesh, which included developing a computer assisted program for formulating rations for lactating cows, a calf starter ration and a ration for growing heifers. “Making <b>dairy</b> <b>feed</b> is the intermediate step in having more milk, meat, money and manure produced in Bangladesh so people there will have more protein, energy, vitamins and minerals in their diets, more money in their pockets and more rice straw converted to fertilizers to increase soil fertility”, Dr. Chapin mentioned in his comments after the assignment. In practice, feed produced following Chapin’s formulation is showing highly encouraging results with an average increase in milk production by around 40 percent, which means, the cow that earlier gave an average of five liters milk per day, now with Chapin formulated feed is giving seven liters. Feed production plant manager Mohammad Khasru and marketing officer Jadu Gopal {{in a recent interview}} mentioned that demand for their <b>dairy</b> <b>feed</b> is increasing and the marketing horizon is gradually being widened to cover most of the strategic dairy pockets in northern, eastern and north eastern parts of the country.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Mycotoxin {{producing}} fungi contaminate feeds pre- or {{post harvest}} and produce aflatoxins B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2. Aflatoxin B 1 is a class 1 human carcinogen and {{is converted to}} aflatoxin M 1 by cows and secreted in milk. Aflatoxin M 1 is a class 2 B (possible) carcinogen and is associated with stunting in children. Aflatoxin B 1 in feeds causes a decrease in milk production, reduced feed conversion efficiency and reduced fertility. A cross-sectional study to assess the economic costs of aflatoxins was done in five counties in Kenya. Methods A map of the five agro-ecological zones of Kenya was used to select the study sites: Kisii and Bungoma (temperate), Tharaka-Nithi (humid), Kwale (sub-humid), and Isiolo(semi-arid). One sublocation was randomly selected from each county. Multistage cluster sampling was done with sub-locations, then villages, then dairy farmers (Dohoo et al., 2012). Milk samples were collected from the dairy farmers. Feed samples were collected from the dairy farmers, feed traders and feed manufacturers. Aflatoxin B 1 and M 1 quantification in dairy feeds and milk was done using a competitive ELISA. Possible economic costs of aflatoxins were estimated using annual quantities/market prices of feeds and milk having aflatoxin B 1 or M 1 respectively above the WHO/FAO standards. Findings and interpretations Sixty two of 101 (61. 4 %) <b>dairy</b> <b>feed</b> samples from feed manufacturers had aflatoxin B 1 levels above the FAO/WHO/Kenya limit of 5 ppb. If this Kenyan legislation would be enforced, the possible economic cost per year for <b>dairy</b> <b>feed</b> manufacturers would be 22. 2 billion US$. Seventeen of 118 (14. 4 %) <b>dairy</b> <b>feed</b> samples from farmers had aflatoxin B 1 levels above 120 ppb. Aflatoxin B 1 concentrations above 120 ppb in dairy feeds {{has been shown to}} cause a 25 % drop in milk production(Guthrie and Bedell, 1979). The annual cost for farmers in Kenya feeding their cows on dairy feeds with aflatoxin B 1 above 120 ppb is estimated at 37. 4 million US$. Of the 283 milk samples from the five counties, 10. 3 % had aflatoxin B 1 levels above WHO/FAO limit of 50 ppt which would cost dairy farmers 113. 4 million US $ per year, if legislation was enforced. Education of farmers, feed manufacturers and traders on good agricultural and feed storage practices could reduce the level of contamination and multiplication of aflatoxin producing fungi and increase profits for the dairy farmers.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{adoption}} of three dry season improved dairy feeding technologies in Nicaragua using a technology stage model. Nicaragua 2 ̆ 7 s dairy productivity {{is one of the}} lowest in Central America and the feeding system is almost exclusively based on pasture. The adoption of improved <b>dairy</b> <b>feed</b> technologies is important in order to increase productivity and maintain the health of the herd during the dry season when pastures are depleted. The study uses field data collected from dairy farmers in the North Pacific, South Pacific and Central Regions in Nicaragua to test the impact of market participation and other factors on improved <b>dairy</b> <b>feed</b> adoption and its impact on dry season productivity. Homemade concentrate using sorghum was investigated as a rudimentary technology, while purchased concentrate and silage were investigated as advanced feed technologies. Descriptive data confirmed that the homemade concentrate technology had the smallest yield gains while the advanced feed technologies of purchased concentrate and silage resulted in higher yields. Econometric results indicate that market participation was positively associated with specialization in dairy production, years of experience, access to credit and a small farm size effect. There was strong evidence regarding the positive effect market participation has on adoption of the advanced feed technologies of purchased concentrate and silage among other factors influencing technology adoption. Propensity score matching results indicated positive returns for homemade concentrate use among farmers involved in mixed cropping-dairy systems. A positive and significant effect was found for purchased concentrate adoption, while silage use alone was found not to have a significant effect although {{there is some evidence that}} its combined use with purchased concentrate can improve yields considerably. Overall results show that policymakers can consider measures to increase farmers 2 ̆ 7 participation in dairy markets in conjunction with research and extension efforts to diffuse new technologies to increase dairy productivity. ...|$|E

To gain influence over those institutions, dissatisfied individuals and groups then turned the PBB contamination into a political controversy. The final section of the present article analyzes how science and politics interacted in: the ways bureaucratic organizations defined the three problems of contamination; the role political controversy played in redefining problems and influencing policy; and the political roles of scientists in controversies over environmental contamination...|$|E
40|$|Mycotoxin-producing fungi {{contaminate}} {{food and}} feeds before, {{during and after}} harvest. Aflatoxins are important mycotoxins and aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) is a class 1 human carcinogen (definitely carcinogenic). Aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1) is a class 2 B (possible) human carcinogen. Aflatoxin B 1 in feeds can decrease milk production, reduce fertility and increase susceptibility to infections. A cross-sectional study of aflatoxin contamination of milk and dairy feeds {{was carried out in}} five counties in Kenya representing different agro-ecological zones: Kwale, Isiolo, Tharaka-Nithi, Kisii and Bungoma. <b>Dairy</b> <b>feed</b> concentrates and cattle milk were collected twice (dry season and rainy season) from 285 dairy farmers in the five counties and analysed for AFB 1 and AFM 1, using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the five counties, the proportion of farmers who fed cattle with dairy concentrates varied from zero to 68 %. The <b>dairy</b> <b>feed</b> concentrates from farmers had AFB 1 levels ranging from less than one part per billion (ppb) to 9661 ppb and the positive samples ranged from 47. 8 to 90. 3 %. The percentages of dairy feeds from farmers with AFB 1 above the World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (WHO/FAO) limit of 5 ppb varied from 33. 3 % to 87. 5 % while 83. 3 % to 100 % of the feeds from retailers and 28. 6 % to 100 % of the feeds from manufacturers exceeded the WHO/FAO limit. Aflatoxin M 1 prevalence in milk was lowest in Kwale (13. 6 %) and highest in Tharaka-Nithi (65. 1 %). The proportion of milk samples with AFM 1 above the WHO/FAO standard of 50 parts per trillion (ppt) varied from 3. 4 % (Kwale) to 26. 2 % (Tharaka-Nithi); the highest was 6999 ppt. This study shows that aflatoxin contamination is common in dairy feeds and in milk and concentrations may be high.

40|$|Heavy metals such as zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), {{chromium}} (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), {{and lead}} (Pb) are potential bioaccumulative toxins of the dairy production system. The heavy metal content of dairy feeds, however, remains poorly documented, {{particularly in the}} United States. This survey determined the heavy metal content of 203 typical dairy ration components sampled from 54 dairy farms in Wisconsin. Lowest heavy metal concentrations were found in homegrown alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay and haylage, and corn (Zea mays L.) grain and silage. Highest metal concentrations were found in purchased feeds, particularly mineral supplements, {{and to a lesser}} extent corn- or soybean-based concentrates. Zinc and Cu were found at the highest concentration in complete dairy (total mixed and aggregated component) rations and reflected the deliberate addition of these metals to meet animal nutrient requirements although more than half the farms fed Cu and Zn above US recommended levels. Concentrations of Cr, As, Cd, and Pb were present in much lower concentrations and decreased in the order Cr>As>Pb>Cd. No complete Wisconsin dairy ration contained heavy metal concentrations above US maximum acceptable concentrations and would be unlikely to induce any toxic effects in dairy cattle. Concentrations of Cd in complete dairy rations were closest to US maximum acceptable concentrations, suggesting the greatest potential long-term risk to exceed US maximum acceptable concentrations if whole farm levels of Cd were to increase in the future. With the exception of Pb, the main sources of Zn, Cu, Cr, As, and Cd in the complete <b>dairy</b> <b>feed</b> ration originated from imported feed. The continued importation of heavy metals in <b>dairy</b> <b>feed</b> is likely to be associated with accumulation of these metals in soils where manure is applied. Although the cycling of many heavy metals through the dairy food chain will be limited by factors such as a soil's cation exchange capacity, pH, salinity, and phytotoxicity of the metal, these may be less limiting for Cd. It is important that sources of Cd in the dairy system are identified and minimized to prevent problems associated with Cd accumulation in the dairy soil system arising over the long-term...|$|E
