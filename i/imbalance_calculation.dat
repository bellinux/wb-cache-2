40|$|Lithium-ion {{battery is}} the {{development}} trend in the airborne and automotive applications, but there are constraint technical security risk issues. The spontaneous combustion and other safety hazards of the lithium-ion battery are mainly caused by the imbalance of monomers in the lithium-ion battery packs. In order to solve the imbalance problems in the lithium-ion battery monomers that exist during the charging and discharging process, a novel lithium-ion battery balancing strategy is proposed based on the global best-first balancing strategy and integrated <b>imbalance</b> <b>calculation</b> analytical methodology. This strategy analyzes the variation of the cell voltage and capacity of the lithium-ion battery which are two key characteristic factors for the balancing adjustment. The integration effect degrees of these two core factors are determined for seeking the optimal balancing path to achieve the active equalization of the lithium-ion battery under charging, discharging and shelving conditions. The experimental results show that, the integrated imbalance degree of remaining capacity and terminal voltage of the battery monomer is no greater than 8 % and the real-time active equalization goals of the lithium-ion battery under different operating conditions are achieved through the equalization adjustment system (EAS) design and implementation, providing security protection for the lithium-ion battery application...|$|E
40|$|As being {{applying}} {{to become a}} member of the European Union, Romania must, among many other things, accept the EU Electricity Directive from 1999 that stipulates how the energy shall be treated within the Union. In this Directive, it is clearly stated that all the countries within the European Union have to have a deregulated electricity market. The main objective of deregulating the wholesale electricity market around the world is to improve the efficiency of the electric power industry by encouraging competition. Or as it is written in the Directive; �To ensure the free movement of electricity while improving the security of supply and the competitiveness of the European economy. � [4] To be able to fulfil this mandatory task, the Romanian Market Operator OPCOM, has today contracted the French company AREVA T&D, who is in charge of the implementation of a new deregulated electricity market, with its main function being the Day-Ahead Market infrastructure (web-based bidding interface with market participants, matching process and settlement). This market is supposed to be taking into action during the summer of 2005. The scope of this training can be summarized in the following points, � Analyse the proposed national market rules of Romania. These rules integrate a Day- Ahead Market, a Balancing Market and <b>Imbalance</b> <b>Calculation.</b> � Analyze the formulation of the Settlement of these markets. The Settlement has the object to determine the payments for transactions made under the different markets by the market actors. � Develop a prototype / simulator of these Settlement rules that will allow verifying their consistence and that will be used in testing and demonstration environment. It is important to mention that the analyses above will be a theoretical analysis on the rules since the project is still in a developing phase and has not been tested in a real environment. The prototype / simulator will be implemented using AIMMS mathematical modelling language, where all settlement rules have to be implemented. The idea of the prototype is to simulate how the rules will behave and if the results are credible. To verify that the rules have been implemented in the right manners, the results given by AIMMS will then be compared with the results from the AREVAS�s e-terra settlement products, which is the simulator that is going to be used in the future market. Except for the settlement rules, the developed prototype will also include the matching process with its offer-acceptance algorithm to determine the cleared energy and price for each trading interval, and will serve to give feedback to the future matching process. It aims also to validate the results provided by the delivered algorithm. To be able to get a full vision, and as well to understand their implementation, the three different notions, Day-Ahead Market, Balancing Market and Imbalance Calculations studied under this project will be explained in detail, the role they play and why they are needed in a deregulated environment. Summarizing, this report will treat the following markets and areas; � Day-Ahead Market � Balancing Market � <b>Imbalance</b> <b>Calculation</b> � Settlement of these three processes Finally, some screenshot will be shown to visualise the prototype and how the results are presented to the customer together with some conclusions and the future work that can be done...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} conditions along the Antarctic Peninsula have undergone considerable changes {{during the last}} 50 years. A period of pronounced air temperature raise, increasing ocean temperatures as well as changes in the precipitation pattern have been reported by various authors. Consequently, the glacial systems showed changes including widespread retreat, surface lowering as well as increased flow speeds. During the last decades numerous ice shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula retreated, started to break-up or disintegrated completely. The loss of the buttressing effect caused tributary glaciers to accelerate with increasing ice discharge along the Antarctic Peninsula. Quantification of the mass changes is still subject to considerable errors although numbers derived from the different methods are converging. We analysed time series of various SAR satellite sensors (ERS- 1 / 2 SAR, ENVISAT ASAR, RADARSAT- 1, ALOS PALSAR, TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X, Sentinel- 1) to detect changes in ice flow speed and surface elevation. The aim is to study the reaction of glaciers to the changing climatic conditions, especially the readjustments of tributary glaciers to ice shelf disintegration, {{as well as to}} better quantify the ice mass loss and its temporal changes. We applyed intensity feature tracking techniques on time series from different SAR satellites over the last 20 years to infer changes in glacier surface velocities. Variations in ice front position are mapped in conjunction with the velocity data sets. High resolution bi-static TanDEM-X satellite data was used to derive digital elevation models by differential SAR interferometry. In combination with ASTER and SPOT stereo images, changes in surface elevations were determined. Altimeter data from ICESat, CryoSat- 2 and NASA operation IceBridge ATM were used for vertical referencing and quality assessment of the digital elevation models. Airborne laser scanning, ground penetrating radar (AWI Polar- 5 / 6, NASA operation ice-bridge) and differential GNSS data from field campaigns support the ice discharge analysis. At the Sjögren-Inlet a total mass loss of - 50. 9 ± 8. 3 Gt and a contribution to sea level rise of 18. 7 ± 5. 2 Gt were found. The current average surface lowering rate amounts to - 2. 1 m/a. At Dinsmoor-Bombardier-Edgeworth glacier system the results show an increase in surface velocity from 0. 9 m/d in 1996 up to 8. 8 m/d in 1999 close to the terminus. Subsequently, surface velocities decreased to 1. 5 m/d in 2014. The changes in flow speeds are coinciding with changes in front position. The surface elevation changed by at least - 130 ± 15 m between 1995 and 2014 and - 40. 7 ± 3. 9 Gt of ice were discharged. The detailed multi-mission time series analysis will support the <b>imbalance</b> <b>calculation</b> in the research area and the interpretation on how ice shelf disintegration affects the tributary glaciers. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine the information content of order imbalances, an important variable in representing trading activity. The Taiwan Stock Exchange launched limited after-hours trading, in which investors can only trade at the closing price of the normal trading hours. Using the data set in Taiwan after-hours market, this article obtains the order <b>imbalances</b> through <b>calculations</b> using the fixed price of the orders, and could compare whose information content with that of other trading variables. The results of this study show when the prices are fixed, the trading price and volume contain less information, however, the excess demand or supply, namely, order imbalance, can provide more information. ...|$|R

40|$|Soilless {{cultivation}} {{systems are}} common in Dutch greenhouse horticulture, i. e., less than 20 % of the greenhouse area is still soil grown. For long, {{it was assumed that}} in these so-called closed systems the emission of nutrients and plant protection products (PPPs) was close to zero. However, Water Boards have shown that in greenhouse areas with soilless cultivations the quality of surface waters is often far below the standards for chemical and ecological good water, as is demanded by the Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC. In 2008 this lead to an agreement between the Grower’s organisation, Water Boards and others to reduce the emission of nutrients and PPPs from these systems to almost zero in 2027. To reach this goal, the sources should be clarified, and solutions should be developed to stop these emissions. We analysed the emission problem by joint fact finding with growers and other stakeholders. Since soilless cultivation systems recirculate nutrient solutions, they have the potency of a closed water cycle, and thus a zero emission of nutrients and PPPs to the water. In reality, drain water is often easily discarded when there is only the slightest doubt about the water quality. On average 10 % of the nutrient solution is discharged yearly. From this follows that soilless cultivation in the Netherlands uses 6. 5 million m 3 year- 1 fresh water, and annually emits 1, 300 ton N, 200 ton P, and 1, 134 kg PPPs. There are large differences in amount discarded between crops and greenhouses: from less than 50 to more than 3000 m 3 ha- 1 year- 1. Reasons for discharge are accumulation of sodium, fear of unknown growth inhibiting factors, imbalances in nutrient composition, and fear of spreading diseases. There can also be significant discharge from filter back-flush water and technical malfunctions. This analysis resulted in a dual approach in our research program. Our long term goal is to close the water and nutrient cycle by developing solutions for the reasons for discharge. We have been focussing on growth inhibition and nutrient <b>imbalances.</b> <b>Calculations</b> show that elimination of those reasons for discharge will reduce the use of fresh water by 2. 6 million m 3 year- 1, and reduce the water pollution by nutrients and PPPs by 60 %. This can be further improved to (almost) 100 % by the already known, but not yet broadly implemented solutions to prevent discharge (i. e., low sodium supply water, adequate disinfection equipment, and the reuse of filter back-flush water). Our second research goal is to develop end-of-pipe solutions through evaluating water purification tech¬niques for use in a greenhouse environment. These techniques may offer a short term solution {{to meet the demands of}} the WFD, but may also be of value on the long term, since growers will want to retain the possibility to discharge occasionally...|$|R
40|$|Bilateral muscular {{imbalance}} {{can increase}} the risk of injury and negatively impact sporting performance. Bilateral muscular imbalances are typically calculated as ((side 1 -side 2) /reference value) x 100, to provide a percentage value of the difference between limbs. Using different numerator (right-left or strong-weak) or reference values (left, right, strong, weak, average of the two) could mask or inflate the true difference value. The present study aimed to compare the bilateral muscular <b>imbalance</b> ratio <b>calculations,</b> using the absolute difference between limbs as the numerator and the five different options as reference values. Twenty three males (21. 6 ± 1. 9 years, 1. 80 ± 0. 06 m, 80. 5 ± 13. 8 kg) and eleven females (20. 8 ± 1. 5 years, 1. 62 ± 0. 03 m, 68. 0 ± 6. 5 kg) performed the one-legged 6 m timed test and the onelegged triple hop distance test. The five possible combinations were compared with a 2 (gender) x 2 (functional test) x 5 (calculation method) ANOVA for each test. Significant differences (P< 0. 05) were found between gender when the right leg was used as the reference value (males: 6. 1 %, females: 9. 1 %), and within calculation methods for males (range: 5. 9 %- 6. 5 %) and females (range: 8. 4 %- 9. 4 %), with low effect sizes (range: 0. 07 - 0. 26). The present findings demonstrate that using a different reference value for calculating bilateral muscular imbalances does not result in a practically significant difference. These findings can be used to inform a more standardised calculation method which will afford conditioning coaches a more correct evaluation and monitoring of training and rehabilitation programmes...|$|R
40|$|In trial-based {{cost-effectiveness}} analysis baseline mean utility values are invariably imbalanced between treatment arms. A patient's baseline utility {{is likely to}} be highly correlated with their quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over the follow-up period, not least because it typically contributes to the QALY <b>calculation.</b> Therefore, <b>imbalance</b> in baseline utility needs to be accounted for in the estimation of mean differential QALYs, and failure to control for this imbalance can result in a misleading incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. This paper discusses the approaches that have been used in the cost-effectiveness literature to estimate absolute and differential mean QALYs alongside randomised trials, and illustrates the implications of baseline mean utility <b>imbalance</b> for QALY <b>calculation.</b> Using data from a recently conducted trial-based cost-effectiveness study and a micro-simulation exercise, the relative performance of alternative estimators is compared, showing that widely used methods to calculate differential QALYs provide incorrect results in the presence of baseline mean utility imbalance regardless of whether these differences are formally statistically significant. It is demonstrated that multiple regression methods can be usefully applied to generate appropriate estimates of differential mean QALYs and an associated measure of sampling variability, while controlling for differences in baseline mean utility between treatment arms in the trial.
