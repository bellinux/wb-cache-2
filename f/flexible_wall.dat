The loss of strength from using thin-walled drip tapes was countered by the additional tensile strength of the entire system (base layer, drip tape and geotextile). While significantly reducing the cost of SSTI, the use of drip tapes also permitted the use of large diameter drip lines (of up to 35mm) allowing for run lengths up to one (1) kilometre. The thin, <b>flexible</b> <b>wall</b> of drip tape also meant that master rolls of manufactured product could be much larger (over 600m in length).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an analytical calculation of break-out noise from a rectangular plenum with four <b>flexible</b> <b>walls</b> by incorporating three-dimensional effects {{along with the}} acoustical and structural wave coupling phenomena. The breakout noise from rectangular plenums is important and the coupling between acoustic waves within the plenum and structural waves in the <b>flexible</b> plenum <b>walls</b> plays {{a critical role in}} prediction of the transverse transmission loss. The first step in breakout noise prediction is to calculate the inside plenum pressure field and the normal <b>flexible</b> plenum <b>wall</b> vibration by using an impedance-mobility approach, which results in a compact matrix formulation. In the impedance-mobility compact matrix (IMCM) approach, it is presumed that the coupled response can be described in terms of finite sets of the uncoupled acoustic subsystem and the structural subsystem. The <b>flexible</b> <b>walls</b> of the plenum are modeled as an unfolded plate to calculate natural frequencies and mode shapes of the uncoupled structural subsystem. The second step is to calculate the radiated sound power from the <b>flexible</b> <b>walls</b> using Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (KH) integral formulation. Analytical results are validated with finite element and boundary element (FEM-BEM) numerical models. (C) 2010 Acoustical Society of America. DOI: 10. 1121 / 1. 3463801...|$|R
5000|$|Much of {{the recent}} history of the “No Blood, No Foul” policy was shaped by the {{so-called}} Torture Memos (also called the Bybee-Yoo memorandum). The Torture Memos were written {{in the wake of the}} attack on 9/11. They detail approved interrogation techniques by evaluating proposed techniques in terms of International Statutes. They give approval to techniques such as walling (shoving a prisoner into a false <b>flexible</b> <b>wall</b> in order to disorient them), sleep deprivation, putting an benign insect in the prisoners box while telling them it is a stinging insect, the use of stress positions, and water boarding.

40|$|Generally, {{solutions}} {{to improve the}} vibration and noise problems are to redesign or modify the system such as increasing {{the thickness of the}} wall panels, enhancing the elasticity of the structure, and increase the damping mechanism of the structure. In this study, the application of vibroacoustic modelling of enclosure coupled to a <b>flexible</b> <b>wall</b> was investigated and its effectiveness was further researched by attaching single and multiple spring-mass-damper (SMD) system for the structural vibration control and sound pressure attenuation. The SMD system is designed to minimize the sound pressure amplitude of a <b>flexible</b> <b>wall</b> of a rigid walled enclosure. The sound pressure characteristics of rigid walled enclosure, such as natural frequency and mode shape were determined using two approaches which are simulation (ANSYS®) and theoretical (MATLAB®). In the preliminary study, the theoretical equation derived in MATLAB® such as rigid walled enclosure coupled to <b>flexible</b> <b>wall</b> and rigid walled enclosure with attached SMD were used to validate finite element analysis (FEA) conducted using ANSYS®. The result indicates that the theory and FEA showed in a good agreement. Thus, proved that the FE model was accurate and can be applied in the subsequent analysis. As the mass and damping of the SMD were changed, the sound pressure of enclosure was also affected. The study showed that with attached SMD to a <b>flexible</b> <b>wall,</b> the sound pressure of enclosure was dropped significantly. From these result, single SMD with mass of 20 kg and damping coefficient of 10 Ns/m provides the best option. As the study extended to multiple SMDs attachment at different location and configuration, the outcomes showed that the center point attachment on <b>flexible</b> <b>wall</b> at coordinate (1, 0. 25, 0. 15) and the combination between location one, two, three and four produce the highest reduction. Finally, it can be concluded that multiple SMDs were able to reduce the sound pressure compared to single SMD. However, for the structures that take weight into consideration, such as in aerospace, automotive and machine system, adding numbers of SMDs will result excess weight to the structure, thus reduce fuel efficiency...|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} of wall modes in fluid flow past a flexible surface is analyzed using asymptotic and numerical methods. The fluid is Newtonian, while two different models {{are used to}} represent the <b>flexible</b> <b>wall.</b> In the first model, the <b>flexible</b> <b>wall</b> is modeled as a spring-backed, plate-membrane-type wall, while in the second model the <b>flexible</b> <b>wall</b> {{is considered to be}} an incompressible viscoelastic solid of finite thickness. In the limit of high Reynolds number (Re), the vorticity of the wall modes is confined to a region of thickness $O(Re ^{- 1 / 3 }) $ in the fluid near the wall of the channel. An asymptotic analysis is carried out in the limit of high Reynolds number for Couette flow past a flexible surface, and the results show that wall modes are always stable in this limit if the plate-membrane wall executes motion purely normal to the surface. However, the flow is shown to be unstable in the limit of high Reynolds number when the wall can deform in the tangential direction. The asymptotic results for this case are in good agreement with the numerical solution of the complete governing stability equations. It is further shown using a scaling analysis that the high Reynolds number wall mode instability is independent of the details of the base flow velocity profile within the channel, and is dependent only on the velocity gradient of the base flow at the wall. A similar asymptotic analysis for flow past a viscoelastic medium of finite thickness indicates that the wall modes are unstable in the limit of high Reynolds number, thus showing that the wall mode instability is independent of the wall model used to represent the <b>flexible</b> <b>wall.</b> The asymptotic results for this case are in excellent agreement with a previous numerical study of Srivatsan and Kumaran...|$|E

40|$|A lot of {{research}} on the properties of a panel-enclosure coupled system which consists of an enclosure with a simply supported <b>flexible</b> <b>wall</b> was conducted. However, an enclosure with clamped flexible walls is commonly encountered. The properties of a panel-enclosure system, with one clamped <b>flexible</b> <b>wall,</b> are different from those of a simply supported one, and {{there are only a few}} studies on it. Thus, this paper is dedicated to the study of the effect of structural-acoustic coupling on the properties of a panel-enclosure system, which consists of an enclosure with a clamped panel. The resonance frequencies and the decay times of the coupled system are obtained using the classical modal coupling theory. The effects of enclosure and its flexible boundary on the resonance frequencies and the modal decay times of the coupled system are then analyzed. It is shown that, when panel thickness is changed, coupling strength is determined by the difference between the resonance frequencies of the panel and the enclosure modes. However, for the variation of enclosure depth, the factor which determines the coupling strength between panel and enclosure modes is the enclosure depth or the difference between their resonance frequencies...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of passive vasomotion on the pressure drop-flow (delta P-Q) {{characteristics of a}} partially compliant stenosis was studied in an in vitro model of the coronary circulation. Twelve stenosis models of different severities (50 to 90 percent area reduction) and degrees of <b>flexible</b> <b>wall</b> (0 to 1 / 2 of the wall circumference) were inserted into thin-walled latex tubing and pressure and flow data were collected during simulated cardiac cycles. In general, the pressure drop increased with increasing fraction of <b>flexible</b> <b>wall</b> for a given flow rate and stenosis severity. The magnitude of this effect was directly dependent upon the underlying stenosis severity. The diastolic delta P-Q relationship of severe, compliant models exhibited features of partial collapse {{with an increase in}} pressure drop at a decreasing flow rate. It is concluded that passive vasomotion of a normal wall segment at an eccentric stenosis in response to periodic changes in intraluminal pressure causes dimensional changes in the residual lumen area which can strongly affect the hemodynamic characteristics of the stenosis during the cardiac cycle. This mechanism may have important implications for the onset of plaque fracture and the prediction of the functional significance of a coronary stenosis based on quantitative angiogram analysi...|$|E
40|$|The {{excitation}} of neutrally stable small-amplitude {{waves in}} a system comprising uniform flow over a <b>flexible</b> <b>wall</b> is studied. Linear theory and numerical simulation are used. A feature of wave excitation in such systems is that distinct amplitude ratios exist when more than one wave is present. An amplitude-ratio equation is first derived for the two waves excited directly by oscillatory excitation applied to a spatially homogeneous plate-spring <b>flexible</b> <b>wall.</b> Thereafter, a second amplitude-ratio equation is derived for waves on a wall with spatially varying foundation-spring stiffness coefficient. In this case, waves beyond a region of changing flexibility are continuously excited by waves propagating through the region of change. Alternatively, it can be considered that an incoming wave evolves into the outgoing wave that emerges from the region of changing wall flexibility. Both energy-flux and WKB methods are used to derive the final amplitude-ratio equation. The theory holds for both upstream- and downstream-propagating waves. It is shown, inter alia, that the waves {{on either side of}} the region of slowly changing wall properties are well-described by the dispersion equation based upon local wall properties. Finally, the case of waves incident upon a region of rapidly changing wall properties is simulated and discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Such methods require first closed form analytic expressions for the natural fluid-structure coupled waveforms that propagate in each duct section and second the corresponding orthogonality relations. It is demonstrated how recent theory [Lawrie, Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser.

The basic concept of a rigid spore wall enclosing two inner, <b>flexible</b> <b>walls</b> still holds true, but there are additional zones within these three walls distinguishable using electron microscopy, including an inner layer that is involved {{in the formation of the}} germination shield. The spore wall has three layers rather than the two reported previously. An outer, thin ornamented layer and an inner, thicker layer are both derived from the hyphal wall and present at all stages of development. These layers differentiate into the outer spore layer visible at the light microscope level. A third inner layer unique to the spore develops during spore swelling and rapidly expands before contracting back to form the second wall layer visible by light microscopy. The two inner <b>flexible</b> <b>walls</b> also are more complex than light microscopy suggests. The close association with the inner <b>flexible</b> <b>walls</b> with germination shield formation consolidates the preferred use of the term 'germinal walls' for these structures.
