25|$|Tropico 2 is {{the first}} game to have a {{campaign}} in the series, in which each scenario has a goal to be accomplished within the time limit. Goals can range from constructing certain structures, having <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the treasury or personal stash, ensuring overall pirate happiness is above a certain point, achieving harmonious relations with a faction, and having {{a certain number of}} ships on the island. The campaign follows a pirate king whose traits change as the campaign goes on.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, borrowers write a post-dated check (check with {{a future}} date) to the lender; if the borrowers don't have <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> their account by the check's date, their check will bounce. In Texas, payday lenders are {{prohibited}} from suing a borrower for theft if the check is post-dated. One payday lender in the state instead gets their customers to write checks dated for the day the loan is given. Customers borrow money because they don't have any, so the lender accepts the check knowing that it would bounce on the check's date. If the borrower fails to pay on the due date, the lender sues the borrower for writing a hot check.|$|E
500|$|Worship {{is practiced}} voluntarily, and desservants and dressed {{followers}} are not paid, neither for worship, nor for consultations. The religion sold nothing, except the sacred books, and refuses {{any form of}} contribution and any will made by a person who still has a family. When the founding couple was living, donations were rejected when the religion had <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> its treasury. Only anonymous donations and bequests are accepted, and {{they go to the}} [...] "Antoinist worship"'s treasury. In Belgium, the finances, which have been published in Le Moniteur Belge every year after the Council meeting, are on the decline and show a minimal activity of the religion.|$|E

500|$|The Cenacle was run {{under the}} {{supervision}} of [...] Dom C. Shiarella, the treasurer of the First National Bank in New Kensington and the cashier of the Building Fund Campaign. He was in charge of collecting all of the pledges made [...] toward the Building Fund. This work kept him in the bank for one or two hours longer than the other employees every evening. This went on for almost five years. [...] Mr. Shiarella was also in charge of making sure there was <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the church's bank account for the payroll that was taken out every other Friday. The needed funds were always collected in time and there was never a week when the account bounced.|$|E
500|$|Ralph Klein's {{major focus}} {{for much of}} his premiership had been the {{elimination}} of the provincial deficit, and the government ran a record $8.9billion surplus during Stelmach's first year in office. [...] Alberta {{was in the midst of}} a major economic expansion driven by high energy prices and major oilsands development. [...] This growth continued into 2007–2008, when the government's surplus was $4.6billion. [...] Both of these surpluses were higher than expected, and Stelmach's government followed a policy of placing one third of unanticipated surpluses into savings and two-thirds into construction projects. Critics, including Liberal MLA Laurie Blakeman and the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, charged that the government was not saving <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> anticipation of a fall in energy prices.|$|E
500|$|Edna asks [...] "Woodrow" [...] for a photograph, so Bart {{searches}} {{through a}} book called NHL Stars of 1969 and sends her a picture of ice hockey star Gordie Howe. Bart, as Woodrow, writes Edna other letters, using dialogue from old romance films {{to tell her what}} she wants to hear. He then sends a letter asking for them to meet at the Gilded Truffle restaurant. Bart sees Edna waiting for Woodrow, and laughs as he goes to watch a movie. When he comes back and sees Edna still at the restaurant on the verge of tears, Bart is upset and guilty to see her crying. Meanwhile, Homer resists temptations to curse but nevertheless experiences intense feelings of rage. However, his constant swearing eventually puts <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the jar to purchase a dog house.|$|E

500|$|For winter recreation, {{there are}} a number of Washington state sno-parks on the south side that are popular with snowmobilers and {{cross-country}} skiers. There are three sno-parks on Mount Adams south slope: Snow King, Pineside, and Smith Butte Sno-parks. The south side of the mountain, especially the A.G. Aiken Lava Bed, is especially popular with snowmobilers and skiers. The Mount Adams Recreation Highway (FR 80) is plowed all the way to Pineside and Snow King Sno-parks at about [...] elevation for most of the year, as long as there is <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the Forest Service's winter budget. Smith Butte Sno-park, at about , is accessible in low-snow years. Most of the time, the road is not plowed all the way to Smith Butte. The Forest Service does this in order to not dry up the forest service's snowplowing funds.|$|E
500|$|Hastings {{was born}} on 17 March 1880 in London to Alfred Gardiner Hastings and Kate Comyns Carr, a painter and the sister of J. Comyns Carr. Having been born on Saint Patrick's Day Hastings was named after the saint. His father was a {{solicitor}} with [...] "somewhat seedy clients", and the family were repeatedly bankrupted. Despite financial difficulties, there was <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the family to send Hastings to a private preparatory school in 1890 and to Charterhouse School in 1894. Hastings disliked school, saying [...] "I hated the bell which drove us up in the morning, I hated the masters; above all I hated the work, which never interested me in the slightest degree". He was bullied at both the preparatory school and at Charterhouse, and did not excel at either sports or his studies.|$|E
500|$|The Coinage Act of 1873 {{intentionally}} omitted language {{authorizing the}} coinage of “standard” silver dollars and ended the bimetallic standard {{that had been}} created by Alexander Hamilton. While the Coinage Act of 1873 stopped production of silver dollars, it was the 1874 adoption of Section 3568 of the Revised Statutes that actually removed legal tender status from silver certificates in the payment of debts exceeding five dollars. By 1875 business interests invested in silver (e.g., Western banks, mining companies) wanted the bimetallic standard restored. People began {{to refer to the}} passage of the Act as the Crime of '73. Prompted by a sharp decline in the value of silver in 1876, Congressional representatives from Nevada and Colorado, states responsible for over 40% of the world’s silver yield in the 1870s and 1880s, began lobbying for change. Further public agitation for silver use was driven by fear that there was not <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the community. Members of Congress claimed ignorance that the 1873 law would lead to the demonetization of silver, despite having had three years to review the bill prior to enacting it to law. Some blamed the passage of the Act on a number of external factors including a conspiracy involving foreign investors and government conspirators. In response, the Bland–Allison Act, as it came to be known, was passed by Congress (over a Presidential veto) on 28 February 1878. [...] It did not provide for the [...] "free and unlimited coinage of silver" [...] demanded by Western miners, but it did require the United States Treasury to purchase between $2 million and $4 million of silver bullion per month from mining companies in the West, to be minted into coins.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{critical}} success of In the Land of Grey and Pink, the group were disappointed by {{its lack of}} commercial success, believing that Decca were not promoting the band properly or investing <b>enough</b> <b>money.</b> <b>In</b> August 1971, David Sinclair accepted a job with former Soft Machine drummer Robert Wyatt's new band, Matching Mole. Reflecting on the decision to leave, Sinclair later said [...] "I felt {{the whole thing was}} going a bit stagnant... I wanted to play with other people, but had to accept that with Caravan it was either all or nothing." [...] Hastings remembers that [...] "Dave's departure was a serious blow." ...|$|E

50|$|So Wigtown and Garliestown {{had been}} reached, the latter by an {{unauthorised}} railway branch; but Whithorn interests had subscribed {{money to the}} railway, {{and it was still}} four miles (6 km) from their town. Energetic canvassing for share subscription proved to be successful, and <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> came <b>in</b> to let a contract to complete the line. Fresh Parliamentary authority was obtained in the 1877 session to extend the share capital and to legalise the Garliestown branch.|$|R
2500|$|Sunoco Logistics, {{the future}} {{operator}} of the pipeline, has spilled crude oil from its onshore pipelines more often since 2010 {{than any other}} US pipeline operator, with at least 203leaks disclosed to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, {{with a total of}} [...] of crude oil spilled. The Iowa Environmental Council stated it is [...] "concerned whether the state has enough protections—from state government oversight to ensuring the company has <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> reserve to address any harm caused by a spill". Iowa state laws require pipeline owners to have only a $250,000-reserve fund. [...] Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement called the $250,000-reserve fund [...] "fiscally irresponsible" [...] and suggested raising it to at least $1billion, indexed to inflation, which would match Alaska's precautions of protection.|$|E
2500|$|In Massachusetts, {{a roughly}} $800million fund {{known as the}} [...] "uncompensated care pool" [...] was used to {{partially}} reimburse hospitals for expenses related to treating uninsured patients. The fund's revenue comes from an annual assessment on employers, insurance providers and hospitals, plus contributions {{of state and federal}} tax dollars. Governor Romney's plan redirects money from this fund to subsidize health insurance costs for low-income residents of Massachusetts. The Romney Administration consulted with Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Jonathan Gruber to study the state's population and health care needs. They determined that there was <b>enough</b> <b>money</b> <b>in</b> the [...] "free care pool" [...] to implement the Governor's plans, but that it would require more people to buy health insurance at full price in order to pay into the subsidized fund.|$|E
