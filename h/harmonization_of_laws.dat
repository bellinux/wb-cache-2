It analyzes whether there is a significant connection between attitude towards implementation of IASB standards and background variables such as share of foreign ownership, number of foreign subsidiary companies, number of stock exchanges on which the company is listed, and the proportion of sales exported. These are variables that we believe reflect a company’s extent of internationalization. The overall results show that financial managers of Swedish listed companies are cautiously positive towards the implementation of IASB standards. The study also shows that there is a significant connection between extent of internationalization and attitude towards the implementation of IASB standards. Financial managers of internationalized companies are generally more positive towards the implementation of IASB standards than their colleagues in less internationalized companies...|$|E

In the field of banking industry the precondition for <b>harmonization</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> is the integration of internal market with the free movement of capital. The regulation and supervision of banks in EU still remains fragmented. European member states still have diverse regulations concerning the role of the state. The European Commission has the important function of proposing EU legislation on financial services including banks and ensuring that EU law is properly applied throughout the EU. Banks are considered as a key industry enabling all the economic activities via depositing, crediting and arranging of payments. A number of secondary legislation has been adopted by the EU institutions to harmonize the national banking law of Member States. The principles and objectives set by the European Commission Treaty depend on four EU freedoms with the aim of effective and open market including banks.

40|$|Abstract Even {{though there}} exists an {{extensive}} Law and Economics {{literature on the}} topics <b>of</b> procedural <b>law</b> and <b>harmonization</b> <b>of</b> <b>law,</b> very little has been written on <b>harmonization</b> <b>of</b> procedural <b>law</b> as such. In this paper I first provide {{a brief overview of}} the economic approach to legal intervention, private enforcement and procedural law. Subsequently, I discuss the economics <b>of</b> <b>harmonization</b> <b>of</b> (substantive) private <b>law.</b> The traditional legal arguments in favor <b>of</b> <b>harmonization</b> (differences in legal rules between countries result in legal uncertainty and increased costs and therefore hinder cross-border trade, and harmonization would create a level playing field) turn out to be unconvincing. The economic analysis <b>of</b> <b>law</b> provides several arguments against harmonization (regulatory competition enables satisfying a larger number of preferences, it enables learning effects, (centralized) legislators suffer from limited information and the possible influence of interest groups should be taken into account) and in favor of it (the need to internalize interstate externalities, the desire to avoid a race to the bottom, decreasing transaction costs and profiting from economies of scale). These arguments have to be weighed in order to reach a conclusion on the desirability <b>of</b> <b>harmonization</b> Such a weighing shows that there is, at best, a limited scope for <b>harmonization</b> <b>of</b> procedural <b>law</b> (and then only as an additional option). Harmonization would remove the possible learning effects and does not allow satisfying a larger number of preferences. The possible arguments in favor <b>of</b> <b>harmonization</b> <b>of</b> procedural <b>law</b> seem week, especially now procedural law is closely connected to the underlying substantive law. The only potentially strong argument is the reduction of transaction costs. It is ultimately an empirical matter if this argument outweighs the arguments against harmonization.

40|$|The {{theme of}} this {{dissertation}} thesis is: The perspectives of harmonization of direct income taxes in the European Union. The reason for choosing this topic was firstly the current issue, which offers a wide scope for research and polemic over new approaches and solutions in the European and international tax law. The European Union is a supranational organization founded {{on the principle of}} conferral of powers. The ideas of the approximation of the laws are not only its own, but occur throughout the world community, because thanks to the harmonization of certain legislation the benefits of international trade can maximize. The idea of exclusion from economic cooperation today is practically unrealistic. In the European Union the <b>harmonization</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> {{is directly related to the}} development of the internal market. The European Union has a long-term goal to create a market that acts as a market of one country. The instrument of harmonization seeks to eliminate differences in legal systems so as not to impede the implementation of the four fundamental freedoms of the internal market. Taxation is a very specific and also sensitive area. The area of taxation is traditionally perceived as a sovereign expression of state sovereignty. The aim of this thesis is the attempt to find the best solutions how to [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Terminology is an {{integral}} part of every translation process, necessary to achieve high-quality translation. In the case of EU law, terminology is additionally a matter of legal certainty and clarity. Terminological errors may lead to citizens and companies misunderstanding their rights and obligations, make the <b>harmonization</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> between Member States more difficult and often result in legal disputes at national or EU level, thus tarnishing the image of the European Union and its institutions. This is why EU language services place great emphasis on terminology work and on integrating terminology in their translation process. The aim of terminology work is, firstly, to give translators timely terminological support: to find a correct equivalent, to clear the meaning of a concept, to coin a brand new term or to help them choose the right equivalent in a given context, out of many equally correct terms, based on the criteria of consistency, accuracy and clarity. Secondly, the aim of terminology work is to manage the existing terminology resources. This work is both of a descriptive and prescriptive nature and the central hub for EU terminology is the multilingual termbase IATE, jointly managed by several EU institutions and accessible also to the general public.

40|$|There are two {{progressive}} scholarly {{perspectives on}} the <b>harmonization</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> within the European Union (EU).

Currently the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) of 2007 signed in Lisbon is legally binding concerning the common transport policy of the EU. The dynamic pace of {{the implementation of the}} common transport policy the EU was commenced {{from the beginning of the}} 1990 s’ of the last century. The recognition of the importance and the role of transport for the EU as a whole by the Member States has created opportunities for the development of this branch of the economy, which for almost thirty years of the European integration was being marginalized. In contemporary rules about the common transport policy most barriers to its functioning throughout the continent were eliminated. For the EU the Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) importance stems also from the fact that it should contribute to the achievement of greater economic and spatial cohesion of the European Union. The task of the TEN-T network is to increase the technical standardization of individual national networks, improvement of transport infrastructures, access facilitation to infrastructure and fostering better connections between national networks and transport modes. Today we can say without hesitation, that there has been huge progress in the implementation of the common transport policy in the EU.

40|$|The {{constant}} {{clash of}} African culture and traditions with human rights continue to militate against the adequate protection of women’s rights. Thus, African women constantly face challenges resulting from restrictions under customary laws of succession and inheritance, witchcraft violence, degrading treatment to widows, domestic violence; women killed by their partners, rape {{of women and}} children under all kinds of circumstances. This thesis was prompted by the issues raised in the Bhe case of the Constitutional Court of South Africa. In this landmark judgment, Ngcobo J dealt with the development of customary law, and how it must be approached by the courts in a manner that would have due regard to the rights of women on one hand and, on the other, would also accord customary law of its proper place, purpose and values within the African context. Against this background, the thesis focused on South Africa, Nigeria and Lesotho as excellent models of the broader challenges for women as well as governments; despite certain legislative measures put in place by the latter, the battle continues unabated for the balance of traditions and culture with women’s rights issues. Although South Africa is more progressive in terms of Constitution and practice than Nigeria and Lesotho, a lot still needs to be done particularly in the area of <b>harmonization</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws.</b> Regrettably, in Nigeria and Lesotho respect for the Constitution is superficial and lacks substantive policies that would promote women’s rights. To this extent, the balance of democratic values and promotion of women’s rights issues within the continent lie in women being partners in development rather than unduly suffering under intense burden of culture, tradition and societal stereotypes. ...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{science has}} been {{evolving}} in {{faster and more}} effective ways {{in order to find}} innovative solutions to reduce the impact that every human activity and new technology have on the environment. This scenario should be the same in the field of environmental law. However, the evolution of environmental laws and policies has been different. Particularly, the <b>harmonization</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> to assess risks of damage to the environment has developed significantly compared to the existing liability systems to address environmental damage. Traditionally, the actions of liability for environmental damage at an international level have been governed by civil liability provisions which have led to unnecessary complexity, overlap of jurisdictions and an unsuccessful restoration of the environment in some cases. This is shown in the efforts of the International Law Commission (ILC) to develop international law to address environmental damage by effective response measures for restoration in addition to compensation. Some other examples followed the same tendency to the administrative approach to liability by means of response measures. The Protocol on Civil Liability and Compensation for Damage Caused by the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents on Transboundary Waters included the concept of response measures following an industrial accident notwithstanding the civil liability nature of the protocol. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty rephrases a similar procedure to the administrative approach to liability implementing response actions in case of an environmental emergency. However, the first legal instrument addressing environmental damage via an administrative approach to liability is the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (The Nagoya Protocol). This paper will analyze the Nagoya Protocol as an example of administrative approach to liability in case of damage to biodiversity and will examine the challenges to implement this Protocol in domestic legislation. Key issues will be explored such as the distinction between administrative approach to liability and administrative liability in the sense of State liability, the concept of operator linked to causality, and a clear distinction between, regulatory measures targeted to minimizing risk; and, liability measures applicable after the damage has occurred, in order to provide for restoration or compensation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2008. Based on my conclusion, {{the mere}} harmonizing of IP laws without {{concomitant}} {{changes to the}} legal regimes of member nations may not yield similar judicial outcomes. Consequently, the underlying use and reliance on convergence theory by WTO may not work and should be reevaluated {{in light of this}} research. Globalization has created pressures on nations to conform their societies, culture, political ideologies, and laws in order to engender parity and facilitate economic trade, foreign direct investment and technology transfers. Multilateral trade and global economic alliances like the World Trade Organization ("WTO") have demanded that member nations conform their business practices and laws to achieve a "level playing field. " In order to accomplish this, the WTO has adopted and relied considerably on convergence theory. This theory maintains, in part, that the <b>harmonization</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> such as those dealing with intellectual property ("IP") will make the global marketplace more efficient and fair and benefit participating nation economies. However, merely harmonizing IP laws may be insufficient to create a "level playing field" for trade and commerce. In order for convergence theory to work, not only must IP laws be harmonized, but more importantly, the respective legal regimes of the signatory countries must also be conformed. This research analyzes the harmonization of IP laws across three different legal regimes. In particular, I focus on the regimes of America, Japan and the Philippines, which have harmonized their IP laws in accordance with the WTO requirements. Using legal case studies I conducted personal interviews of selected judges and justices from each legal regime to identify their mental processes used in judicial decision making. The research yielded results which indicated that given similar laws and facts, jurists from each legal regime use unique mental processes not used by jurists of other regimes. This finding was corroborated by the significant variations in judicial outcome between regimes, and the lack of uniformity of outcome across ail regimes. From this finding, I conclude that legal regimes appear to serve as a moderator of judicial outcome. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 225 - 241).
