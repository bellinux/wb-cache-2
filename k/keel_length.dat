40|$|Populations of Greater Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) {{have been}} declining because {{of loss and}} {{fragmentation}} of tallgrass prairie habitats, and management plans require contemporary demographic data. Our objectives were to determine whether maternal nutrition or predation were determinants of nesting success and female survival. We captured and radio-marked 43 females at four leks in natural, unfragmented prairie during a 4 -year study. Reproductive potential was high because females laid large clutches (10. 9 ± 0. 3 eggs, n = 24), renested following clutch loss (22. 2 %, n = 27 females), and had high egg viability (88. 6 ± 5. 0 % of eggs hatched; n = 7 nests), but reproductive traits {{were not correlated with}} female morphometrics (mass, or tarsus and <b>keel</b> <b>lengths).</b> Daily survival rate of nests was low (0. 928, n = 34 nests) resulting in a predicted nest success rate of 7. 4 % for a 35 -day exposure period. We used known fate models to estimate weekly survival from telemetry data for 40 females. Weekly survival was 0. 970 and the extrapolated survival rate for the 6 -month breeding season was 45. 7 %. Using time-since-marking Cormack-Jolly-Seber models for live encounter data to control for transience, annual apparent survival was 0. 277 ± 0. 081 SE for 55 marked females after initial capture, and 0. 424 ± 0. 139 during subsequent intervals. Survival of females was 1. 6 to 2. 0 times higher during the nonbreeding season than the breeding season, presumably because females are susceptible to predation during incubation and brood-rearing. Predation of nests and females may be the main demographic factors limiting population viability because predation, and not maternal nutrition, accounted for unexpectedly low nesting success and breeding season survival of Greater Prairie-Chickens in natural habitats. Future research should investigate rangeland practices that increase residual nesting cover or reduce predator impacts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In an {{experimental}} strain of white plumage geese created in 1989, two experiments {{were carried out}} from 1993 to 1995 in order to estimate genetic parameters for growth, and carcass composition traits in non-overfed animals, and genetic parameters for growth and fatty liver formation in overfed animals. Four hundred and thirty-one non-overfed animals were bred and slaughtered at 11 weeks of age; they were measured for forearm <b>length,</b> <b>keel</b> bone <b>length,</b> chest circumference and breast depth before and after slaughtering. The carcasses were partly dissected in order weigh breast, breast muscle and skin + fat, and abdominal fat. Four hundred and seventy-seven overfed animals were slaughtered at 20 weeks of age; they were measured for "paletot" (breast meat, bone and meat from wings, bone and meat from thigh and legs) weight and liver weight. In these two experiments, the weights had moderate to high heritability values. Breast depth measured on live animals showed a low heritability value. In overfed animals, liver weight showed a high heritability value. Liver weight could be increased by selection without a great effect on "paletot" weight. Thus, obtaining a white plumage geese strain for fatty liver production by selection would be difficult because only 20 % of overfed animals had fatty liver. The results did not allow to conclude {{on the influence of}} selection on liver weight on carcass traits such as muscle or fatty tissue weight. </p...|$|R

5000|$|All {{three had}} fine lines at bow and stern, uniform frames mid-ships with concave and convex sweeps {{and a deep}} <b>keel.</b> Their <b>length</b> to beam ratio was unusually high, giving them a {{remarkable}} turn of speed. The foremast was square rigged while the other three or four masts were fore-and-aft rigged, barquentine fashion but carrying very simplified standing and running rigging. Each sail was equipped with a horizontal sprit that enabled it to be brailed up to its mast and deployed rapidly. Each mast carried three sails. The topmasts could be lowered and replaced from the deck, in the event the sprits were to fail in strong gales {{and had to be}} abandoned. The Patent granted to Gower in 1799 details his theory about the relationship between speed and the length to beam ratio, as well as details of many features of his novel form of rigging, which allowed almost all activities normally conducted aloft to be performed from the deck (including the replacement of damaged masts) thus only the foremast was fitted with ratlines.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} activity represents the logical {{continuation of the}} work documented in [1] and [2] on water on deck and parametric roll for an FPSO in regular waves. Here the same numerical method, based on a domain-decomposition strategy, is {{used to examine the}} platform with bilge keels, both without and with mooring-line system. It is found that bilge <b>keels</b> with <b>length</b> 40 % of the ship length and with breadth the 3 % of the ship breadth limit effectively the roll when instability is promoted by vertical bow motions in waves. In these conditions also the amount of the shipped water is substantially reduced. Large roll induced by the coupling with the lateral motions seems to be less well counteracted and remains close to 10 ° for steepness kA ≥ 0. 2. This value is often set as maximum allowed amplitude for FPSOs in normal operational conditions. Also the effect on the shipped water is limited in this case. Increasing the bilge-keels breadth is confirmed to be beneficial but the combination of the mooring system with dynamic positioning appears needed for a proper control of the roll motion in the worst examined cases...|$|R
