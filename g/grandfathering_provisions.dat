5000|$|Canada {{had a gun}} {{registry}} {{during the}} Second World War, when all people were compelled to register their firearms {{out of fear of}} enemy subversion. This registry in Canada was discontinued after the war; however, all handguns (restricted) have been subject to registration since 1934. In addition, fully automatic firearms have been prohibited (with grandfathering exemptions to existing, licensed collectors of full-automatic weapons and theatrical users) since 1977. A Firearms Acquisition Certificate (FAC) was required to purchase any firearm since its implementation in 1977, although additional restrictions applied for handguns (restricted - 1934) and fully automatic firearms (prohibited −1977). To obtain an FAC, no training was required until the Canadian Firearms Safety Course and Test program (non-restricted, restricted, or combined courses/tests) was created as a prerequisite in Bill C-17 in 1991. This formal training, once common in families and even schools, has been credited with the marked reduction of accidents involving the improper handling of firearms. Under bill C-17 (1991), and subsequent legislation and/or orders in council, short-barreled handguns and those firing [...]25 ACP and [...]32 ACP ammunition, and all handguns with a barrel length under 105mm (~4.1"), with the exception of certain guns typically used in shooting competitions, were added to the list of prohibited firearms. In addition, a large reclassification of firearms was made to place many firearms with certain cosmetic and functional characteristics into the category and registration of 'restricted' or 'prohibited' firearms. Some classes of these firearms have also been subject to <b>grandfathering</b> <b>provisions</b> of the law to owners and collectors, including some limited allowances of willing/gifting certain prohibited firearms to a family member to preserve them for historic value as pre-1945 collectors pieces.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} unintended {{effects of}} air quality regulation on decisions of major polluters, using plant data for 1963 to 1992. A key regulatory tool since 1978 is the annual designation of county air quality attainment status, where non-attainment status triggers specific equipment requirements for" new and existing plants. We find, {{in the later}} years of regulation, that, ceteris paribus, non-attainment status reduces expected births in polluting industries by 40 - 50 %, resulting in a shift of polluting activity to cleaner, less populated attainment areas. Starting in the 1970 s effects appear first for industries with bigger plant sizes and then, within industries, first for corporate plants relative to the much smaller non-affiliate, or single plant firm sector. In all industries, non-affiliates face less regulation than the bigger corporate plants, resulting in a permanent shift away from corporate plant production in some industries. Older plants benefit from <b>grandfathering</b> <b>provisions</b> greatly enhancing survival probabilities. Finally, the negotiation and permitting process under regulation appears to induce much greater up-front investments by new plants, so that, in non-attainment areas, regulation induces 50 - 100 % increases in initial plant sizes compared to attainment areas. But for plants over 10 years of age there are no size differences. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{argue in}} favour of the {{shareholder}} model of the firm for three main reasons. First, serving multiple stakeholders leads to ill-defined property rights. What sounds like a fair compromise between stakeholders can easily evolve in a permanent struggle between the stakeholders about {{the ultimate goal of}} the company. In many cases, the vague Rhineland principles no longer offer much protection to workers. Second, giving workers a claim on the surplus of the firm raises the cost of capital for investments in jobs, which harms the position of job seekers, including new entrants to the labour market. Third, and most importantly, making shareholders the ultimate owner of the firm provides the best possible diversification of firm-specific risks. Whereas globalisation has increased firm-specific risk by intensifying competition, globalisation of capital markets has also greatly increased the scope for diversification of firm-specific risk. Diversification of this risk on the capital market is an efficient form of social insurance. Reducing the claims of workers on the surplus of the firm {{can be seen as the}} next step in the emancipation of workers. Workers derive their security not from the firm that employs them but from the value of their own human capital. In such a world, global trade in corporate control, global competition and creative destruction associated with these developments are more legitimate. Coordination in wage bargaining and collective norms on what is proper compensation play an important role in reducing the claim of workers on the firm 2 ̆ 019 s surplus, thereby protecting workers against firm-specific risks. Indeed, in Denmark, workers bear less firm-specific risk than workers in the United States do. Collective action thus has an important role to play. Politicians, however, also face the temptation to please voters and incumbent workers with short-run gains at the expense of exposing workers to firm-specific risks and reducing job creation. This is why corporate governance legislation that gives moral legitimacy to the claim of insiders on the surplus of the firm is damaging. The transition from the Rhineland model (in which management serves the interests of all stakeholders) towards the shareholder model is fraught with difficulties. While society reaps long-run gains in efficiency, in the short run a generation of insiders has to give up their rights without benefiting from increased job creation and higher starting wages. Whereas the claims of older workers on the surplus of a firm may thus have some legitimacy, younger cohorts should be denied such moral claims. These problems require extreme political skill to solve. In particular, they may require some <b>grandfathering</b> <b>provisions</b> or temporary explicit transfers from younger to older generations...|$|E

40|$|This {{proposed}} amendment will incorporate {{by reference}} the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) revisions to plantwide applicability limitations (PALs) for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions finalized with Step 3 of the GHG Tailoring Rule. These revisions give facilities subject to GHG permitting {{the option of}} establishing PALs on a carbon dioxide equivalent basis and documents that EPA is retaining the current GHG permitting thresholds, ensuring that GHG permitting requirements continue to apply to large sources only. The rulemaking will also remove the EPA’s <b>grandfather</b> <b>provision</b> that allowed certain sources to use coarse particulate matter as a surrogate for fine particulate matter during the transition to PM 2. 5 permitting. This administrative change which will update the incorporation by reference date for the GHG PAL option will not affect any Missouri sources. Other revisions include correcting the definition of "regulated NSR pollutant", modifying the notification period for initial equipment startup to improve tracking of new/modified equipment and testing, and clarifying de minimis permit air quality analysis requirements. * 10 CSR 10 - 5. 570 (amendment) Control of Sulfur Emissions From Stationary Boilers This proposed amendment will clarify that the brewery sulfur dioxide (SO 2) emission limit applies only to the total SO 2 emissions from applicable units within an installation and not the total SO 2 emissions from the entire brewery installation.

40|$|The {{shifting}} {{topography of}} contemporary Japanese society is engendering a significant reorientation of men’s family relations. However, exactly how Japanese men are adapting to these broad-based trends, including parent-child relations, demographics, marriage norms, care provision, residential choices, and gender roles, {{as well as}} in the decline of Confucian worldviews, remains relatively obscure. In this dissertation, I explore men’s everyday practices underpinning their family relations as husbands, fathers, sons-in-law, and grandfathers. I conducted ethnographic fieldwork in the summers of 2013 and 2014 in Hyogo, through narrative interviews and participant-observation. I find husbands’ view of their wives transitioning from having a culturally prescribed duty to perform domestic matters to simply having responsibility for domestic matters. This opens up space for negotiation within married couples, with my informants providing what I refer to as additional help, which offers new insight into charting the evolution of hegemonic masculinity. I evidence relatedness founded on exchange as an approach to understand relations across the extended family, which importantly involves additional help, financial resources, and intimacy. I underscore how men selectively seek intimacy in some family relations, notably as fathers and <b>grandfathers.</b> <b>Provision</b> of additional help and seeking of intimacy lead to men’s (re) construction of masculinities differing across family relations, with an important reason for men to select their practices so as to craft their family relations is to address their sense of well-being. Further, the pattern of men’s family relations reveals the emergence of substantially novel sons-in-law relations, as compared to that found in ie patriarchal norms. This evidence suggests a fundamental shift from a vertically-dominated set of family relations, as in the ie household, to a more horizontal, fluid set of relations across the extended family.
