40|$|The aim of {{my thesis}} {{was to do}} a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of an average <b>thread</b> <b>tap</b> that is {{manufactured}} by Dormer Tools AB, {{and to create a}} practical model that the company can use in order to study other <b>thread</b> <b>taps</b> from an environmental perspective. The method of LCA is used to investigate the environmental effects of a product during its life cycle. This is a gate-to-grave analysis with focus on steel and <b>thread</b> <b>tap</b> manufacturing, coating procedure, use, waste management and transports. Three common coating types were compared separately. Steel manufacturing answers for the highest energy and raw material consumption under the life cycle of the <b>thread</b> <b>tap.</b> Its emissions contribute to global warming, acidification and eutrophication above others. Transport emissions create the most photochemical oxidants (Los Angeles smog). The study has certain limitations, nevertheless I think that it fulfills its aims, and it can – along with the model – be used as the basis of more environmentally adapted product choices at Dormer Tools...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{concurrent}} programming model called <b>threading</b> by appointment (<b>TAP).</b> Unlike traditional <b>threads,</b> <b>TAP</b> <b>threads</b> can only communicate with system components or other threads by appointment. For example, a <b>TAP</b> <b>thread</b> cannot simply try to access some shared resource. Instead, a <b>TAP</b> <b>thread</b> must {{make an appointment}} with the shared resource in advance. Only {{at the time of}} the appointment, the thread can actually access the shared resource. The desired start time and duration of an appointment may either be provided by the thread or computed by the TAP runtime system. The duration of an appointment must be finite. Instantaneous appointments are possible but only allow a single atomic operation per appointment. <b>TAP</b> <b>threads</b> cannot deadlock because the duration of appointments is finite. Race conditions may occur for making appointments but can be avoided by making appointments independently of the system’s progress. Threading by appointment makes the process of determining the time instants for system interaction explicit and may therefore help to increase the determinism of concurrent applications as well as the efficient use of resources. Interesting questions arise such as how to schedule appointments as opposed to how to multiplex resources such as the CPU, and how to define structured programming elements that support threading by appointment. ...|$|R

40|$|Nowdays an {{efficient}} production {{is critical to}} achieve for companies competing {{on the market for}} steel cutting tools. One of such companies is Halmstad based Tooling Support Halmstad AB that manufactures threading-taps, threading-dies and parting off tools, towards a centralized warehouse in Schiedam, Holland. The large amount of different products, approximately 2500 is a big contributor to the problem along with a new order system that creates a demand of low setup times. Previously the company was forwarded orders through quarter based prognoses which enabled planning of the production over a longer time span. Currently the newer order system ZENIT is in use and the company thereby gets their orders weekly. This type of customer orders effects the production in terms of weekly orders having a variety of different products, which in turn creates a larger amount of setup work that prolongs the lead times even further. The purpose of this project has been to survey the present production in the end manufacturing state of the <b>thread</b> <b>taps</b> in order to come up with improvement proposals which will lead to a more flexible production and less sensitive to irregular demand. The factory consists of several production lines. Our work has been limited to the end manufacturing state of the <b>thread</b> <b>taps</b> in one of the 9 production lines, line 435. Based on the limitation our work has followed the production and order use of <b>thread</b> <b>taps</b> from the local storage to precisely before the wash.

It is usually slightly more expensive than externally threaded jewelry, due to the extra machining and labor involved.|$|R

40|$|<b>Threading</b> by Appointment (<b>TAP)</b> is a {{concurrent}} programming model that combines automatic stack management (thread-based) with system call queueing (event-driven). However, unlike conventional <b>threads,</b> <b>TAP</b> <b>threads</b> invoke system calls by appointment only, and, unlike events, appointments have a duration, which {{is determined by}} the TAP runtime system transparently through a POSIX-compliant interface. The TAP mechanism essentially implements system call queueing using a given TAP policy that consists of a strategy to make appointments, i. e., enqueue system calls, and a logical clock to begin and end appointments, i. e., dequeue system calls. We propose a TAP policy that resembles traffic shaping in network routers, where system calls are treated as network packets. The policy distinguishes system calls for network and disk I/O, and gives priority to system calls invoked by short-running, interactive threads rather than long-running, bulk threads. We have implemented a high-performance, user-space TAP library and benchmarked the library using a multi-threaded, POSIX-compliant web server. ...|$|R
5000|$|Truncation is {{achieved}} by using a slightly larger [...] {{in the case of}} female threads, or by slightly reducing the diameter of the threaded area of workpiece in the case of male threads, the latter effectively reducing the thread's major diameter. In the case of female <b>threads,</b> <b>tap</b> drill charts typically specify sizes that will produce an approximate 75 percent thread. A 60 percent thread may be appropriate in cases where high tensile loading will not be expected. In both cases, the pitch diameter is not affected. The balancing of truncation versus thread strength is similar to many engineering decisions involving the strength, weight and cost of material, as well as the cost to machine it.|$|R
