50|$|The other {{economical}} {{concern is}} about the underestimated compensation given by URA. During the reconstruction of Lee Tung Street, the compensation given by the Urban Renewal Authority to the flat owners was $4000 per square feet. However, the selling price of a flat, after the reconstruction, in Avenue Walk is $23000 per square feet in 2013. The URA was criticized for depriving the flat owners by paying an unreasonably low compensation to the <b>flat</b> <b>owner</b> in the affected area i.e. 1.8 billion in total while Urban Renewal Authority is foreseeably gaining $3.4 billion by this project.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the evening}} of 16 May 2015, Joshi {{committed}} suicide in her flat in Versova, Mumbai by slitting her throat with a kitchen knife in the bathroom. The <b>flat</b> <b>owner</b> Madhu Bharti and Joshi's friend Pushpa Parmar were present with Joshi at the flat during the incident. Madhu Bharti recorded a video message on Parmar's mobile phone in which Joshi has named Dr. Vijay Sharma and [...] "many married men" [...] as responsible for her decision to commit suicide. After the message was recorded, they called Joshi's husband Riyaz Pathan who arrived at the scene 10 minutes later, following which Joshi {{was taken to a}} nearby hospital. According to an official, Joshi was taken to the hospital more than an hour after she had slit her throat. The hospital stated that [...] "excessive bleeding" [...] was the cause of her death. The body was sent to Cooper Hospital which confirmed the death as suicide in its post-mortem report.|$|E
50|$|Regent Court {{was built}} round three {{sides of a}} square with the open side facing south and is nine storeys high in the main block and seven storeys on {{the east and west}} wings with a central {{entrance}} leading to a communal lounge. The central block and each wing has an lift though these are quite small and slow, there is no service lift. In total, it comprises 202 flats, ranging from one to three bedrooms and are accessed along open balcony walkways. The heating at Regent Court was included with the rent as was the constant supply of hot water and the rates. Each flat was self contained and also had its own sun balcony, some of those have now been incorporated into the internal living space of the flat. Kitchenettes were equipped with modern devices and the bathrooms had both a toilet and a bath. There was an on site laundrette. Each <b>flat</b> <b>owner</b> has to contribute to the cost of upkeep/maintenance of the block and pay for things like the caretaker's wage, gardening, heating etc.|$|E
50|$|Proprietary {{estoppel}} {{case law}} has, however, {{divided on the}} question of what kind of assurance and what kind of reliance must be present. In Cobbe v Yeoman's Row Management Ltd, a property developer claimed an interest in a group of Knightsbridge flats after his expense in obtaining council planning permission. Mr Cobbe had made an oral agreement with the <b>flat</b> <b>owner,</b> Mrs Lisle-Mainwaring, to get the flats at £12m, but once permission was obtained, the owner broke her oral promise. Even so, in the House of Lords Mr Cobbe failed in his claim for anything more than the expense (£150,000) of getting the planning, because in this commercial context it was clear that formal deeds were needed for completion of any deal. By contrast, in Thorner v Major, David (a second cousin) worked on Peter's farm for 30 years and believed he would inherit it. This probably was intended but after Peter fell out with other relatives, he destroyed his will, leaving David with nothing. Even though no specific assurance, and only some vague conduct indicating an assurance, was present, the House of Lords held that David had a good proprietary estoppel claim. Lord Hoffmann remarked that if a reasonable person could understand, however oblique and allusive, that an assurance was given, a legal right would accrue. The tendency of the cases is therefore to recognise claims more in the domestic context, in which less formal assurances are common, and less in the commercial context, where formality is normal.|$|E

40|$|The main {{upgrading}} programme (MUP) is a {{major policy}} implemented by the Singapore Housing Development Board (HDB) since the 1990 s. This heavily subsidised policy is highly targeted {{in order to enhance}} the social and economic value of public housing in Singapore. It benefits HDB households residing in the older HDB housing estates in terms of both an enhanced asset value of the household's flat and a quality living environment. An HDB <b>flat</b> <b>owner</b> whose precinct is selected for upgrading under the MUP policy is envisaged to be holding a call option to upgrade his flat, as this option to upgrade is valuable and it has an opportunity to command a higher price in the HDB resale market. This paper estimates the option premiums for upgrading by utilising the intuitive and explicit numerical method solution of the binomial real option pricing model and the Samuelson-McKean closed-form solution. The embedded real option premiums under the MUP policy are estimated at S$ 10 300 and S$ 2 000 for the popular three-room HDB flat and four-room HDB flat respectively. It is also found that government subsidies {{have a significant impact on}} the option premiums. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|E
40|$|In {{the era of}} {{neoliberalism}} now {{the people}} especially the lower income group of people is suffering {{a lot for the}} scarcity of housing. After migrating from the rural areas for a better life they discovered themselves in the slum like areas of the city as they are not capable to afford housing in the influential areas of the city due to higher rent. Although government take initiatives to remove the housing scarcity of the lower segment of the people but at the end that is after the completion of the housing the flat has been distributed towards the politically powerful and wealthy persons instead to submit those flats to the slum dwellers. This is the case that has been taken place exactly in the case of Bashantek Rehabilitation Project (BRP) a low cost housing program for the poor initiated by the government of Bangladesh. The real situation is that the real slum dwellers were disposed in the name of low cost housing. Now the <b>flat</b> <b>owner</b> is the politically powerful elite and the wealthy personnel. And throughout of this project the slum dwellers has become the victim of dual burden like disposed form the land and lost the money that has been transferred to the project personnel to get the flat at the same time...|$|E

40|$|My diploma thesis {{deals with}} the issue of owner {{occupied}} housing in the Czech Republic. Attention is paid to the general importance of the provision of housing with emphasis on the social, economic and especially the legal aspects with respect to the rights that are granted by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. It describes in brief the development of flat ownership since the 60 's {{and the role of the}} state in the housing policy, particularly with the aim to bring attention to the existing legal regulation of this area [...] the Flat Ownership Act. The main part of the thesis focuses on the legal regulation of flat ownership which draws on the dualistic concept of house co-ownership and the related ownership of a housing unit (apartment or non-residential area). Emphasis is put on the legal status of flat owners, the summary of rights and obligations that arise from ownership of a flat as a specific subject of property ownership. The ways in which flat ownership rights are formed are presented with regard to the consequences of the ownership rights being entered in the Land Registry. The creation, operation and the position of a Home Owners Association, a body corporate, which is established by law to manage dwelling houses, is presented particularly in relation to a specific <b>flat</b> <b>owner.</b> In this respect, as well as in other sections, the thesis follows the practice of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court that has considerable effect on the interpretation of law and the protection of rights and obligations pertaining to particular owners in exercising their property rights...|$|E

Especially older buildings need systematic maintenance and holistic approach for its perfect functioning. That is why a new residential law has been confirmed in 2003. The law defines that <b>flat</b> <b>owners</b> in a multi-dwelling house, with more than two <b>flat</b> <b>owners</b> and more than eight individual parts select a manger. One of the most important manager's assignments is maintenance of the building. He must be aware that well being of residents is in correlation to his building managing performance. On the other hand condition and lifetime of a building is also a domain of <b>flat</b> <b>owners,</b> who contribute with their participating in maintenance processes. In first chapters of this work a reader can introduce himself with some most important real estate management laws. Management of multi-dwelling houses is definitely set in the limelight. To define the most common maintenance strategies and following troubles with its realization, a questionnaire has been formed and applicated on Slovenian managers.
