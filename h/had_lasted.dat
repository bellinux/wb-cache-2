Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United States and the Soviet Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> {{only a few}} minutes. The Soviet missions had both orbited the Earth, and the second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit for a full day.

The next year, Cody flew the first British-built aeroplane at Farnborough, which earned it the title British Army Aeroplane No.1. This was an ironic achievement for Capper's command, as he had pinned his personal hopes on Dunne, whose D.4 achieved {{no more than a few}} hops.|$|E

5|$|Constellation sailed {{ahead of}} L'Insurgente and crossed her bow, raking {{her with a}} {{broadside}} as she moved past. Constellation sailed over to gain L'Insurgentes starboard side, and the two ships settled into exchanging broadsides. The French frigate was hulled multiple times, disabling the French vessel's 18-pounder guns while Constellation suffered damage to her rigging. Constellation again sailed ahead of L'Insurgente, reversing course to cross her bow and rake her a second time. Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair L'Insurgentes rigging were fruitless. Once more Constellation maneuvered to reach L'Insurgentes leeward side. As Constellation crossed the frigate's bow again to rake her a third time, the French ship struck, having sustained too much damage. The engagement <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> 74 minutes.|$|E
5|$|During the 58-day voyage, twopeople died {{of illness}} and onewoman {{gave birth to a}} child. The voyage to Santo Domingo <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> longer than expected, and {{provisions}} ran low, especially after the loss of the St. François. La Salle had little money with which to replenish supplies, and finally two of the merchants aboard the expedition sold some of their trade goods to the islanders, and lent their profits to La Salle. To fill the gaps left after several men deserted, La Salle recruited a few islanders to join the expedition.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Haefliger's extramarital affair, which <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> {{for over}} a decade, came to an end. Bellette and Haefliger left Australia {{intending}} to divorce quietly, but were reconciled. After a year in Paris they settled in Majorca, living first in Deià before buying {{a house in the}} hamlet of C'an Baxu. Bellette painted landscapes and still lifes that reflected a Spanish influence, and showed periodically in Australia through the 1960s. The year she moved to Majorca {{turned out to be the}} last year in which she exhibited work outside Australia. The couple visited in 1970 and 1975, and Bellette returned once more in 1983.|$|E
50|$|The Labour Act of 2004 {{allows for}} a few {{different}} ways in which employees can be terminated. The first method is in the event of the death of an employee.

The amount of notice given goes as follows: one days notice for a contract that <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> less than three months, one week of notice for a contract that <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> more than three months but less than two years, two weeks for a contract that <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> more than two years but less than five years, and one month for a contract that <b>has</b> <b>lasted</b> for more than five years.

5|$|Armed {{with the}} {{knowledge}} gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit from the cave and launched another assault along the ravine from the west, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. This tactic allowed the Spanish {{to break through the}} pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their Mesoamerican allies. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.|$|E
5|$|By November 1808, the Napoleonic Wars <b>had</b> <b>lasted</b> five years. Although the French had conquered large swathes of {{mainland}} Europe, {{they were}} unable to exert any significant influence at sea, where the British Royal Navy had been dominant since the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805. A vital part of Royal Navy strategy was the implementation of a close blockade of the major French seaports by squadrons of frigates and ships of the line, intended to intercept and capture any ships attempting to enter or leave French harbours. The greatest French Atlantic seaport, and consequently the most important target for the Royal Navy, was Brest, situated on the Northern Biscay coast. Watching Brest were a large number of warships, divided into the inshore squadron designed to watch the coast directly and formed principally of frigates and small fast vessels, and the offshore squadron formed from heavy ships of the line and tasked with intercepting French fleets and battle squadrons spotted by the inshore squadron.|$|E
