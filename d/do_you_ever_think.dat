5000|$|Dawes only {{competed in}} the team {{competition}} in 1992, not breaking through as an all-around gymnast until 1993. She is probably {{best known for her}} performances at the 1993 and 1994 World Championships. In 1993, Dawes led the competition after three events, even beating her more famous teammate Shannon Miller. However, she decided to try her harder vault (1½ twisting layout Yurchenko) worth a 10.00 instead of simply a full-twisting layout Yurchenko, which had been devalued to a 9.8. She made the first vault, but slipped and fell on the second, immediately bursting into tears. With the new rule that both vaults were averaged in all-around competition, her fall dropped her to 4th overall while Miller won the title. Famously, after the vault fall Dawes's coach Kelli Hill exhorted her to be proud of her performance anyway, stating: [...] "When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> would be in that position? You have to be happy with yourself. Come on. Be happy. Stand up and wave". Dawes did so and earned a standing ovation from the crowd. After this disappointment she rebounded in the event finals, winning two silver medals on bars and beam.|$|R

[...] Limbaugh commented on Fluke receiving a call from President Obama, who stated that her parents should be proud of her, saying, [...] "I'm gonna button my lip on that one."

6000|$|Ah, old screen, what a {{gorgeous}} personage {{you must have}} been in your young days, when the tulips and roses and lilies (all growing from one stem) were fresh in their glistening sheen! Many a summer and winter have come and gone since then, my friend, and you have played with the dancing firelight until you have grown sad and gray. Your brilliant colors are fast fading now, and the envious moths have gnawed your silken threads. You are withering away like the dead hands that wove you. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> of those dead hands? You seem so grave and thoughtful sometimes that I almost think you do. Come, you and I and the deep-glowing embers, let us talk together. Tell me in your silent language what you remember of those young days, when you lay on my little mother's lap and her girlish fingers played with your rainbow tresses. Was there never a lad near sometimes--never a lad who would seize one of those little hands to smother it with kisses, and who would persist in holding it, thereby sadly interfering with the progress of your making? Was not your frail existence often put in jeopardy by this same clumsy, headstrong lad, who would toss you disrespectfully aside that he--not satisfied with one--might hold both hands and gaze up into the loved eyes? I can see that lad now through the haze of the flickering twilight. He is an eager bright-eyed boy, with pinching, dandy shoes and tight-fitting smalls, snowy shirt frill and stock, and--oh! such curly hair. A wild, light-hearted boy! Can he be the great, grave gentleman upon whose stick I used to ride crosslegged, the care-worn man into whose thoughtful face I used to gaze with childish reverence and whom I used to call [...] "father?" [...] You say [...] "yes," [...] old screen; but are you quite sure? It is a serious charge you are bringing. Can it be possible? Did he have to kneel down in those wonderful smalls and pick you up and rearrange you before he was forgiven and his curly head smoothed by my mother's little hand? Ah! old screen, and did the lads and the lassies go making love fifty years ago just as they do now? Are men and women so unchanged? Did little maidens' hearts beat the same under pearl-embroidered bodices as they do under Mother Hubbard cloaks? Have steel casques and chimney-pot hats made no difference to the brains that work beneath them? Oh, Time! great Chronos! and is this your power? Have you dried up seas and leveled mountains and left the tiny human heart-strings to defy you? Ah, yes! they were spun by a Mightier than thou, and they stretch beyond your narrow ken, for their ends are made fast in eternity. Ay, you may mow down the leaves and the blossoms, but the roots of life lie too deep for your sickle to sever. You refashion Nature's garments, but you cannot vary by a jot the throbbings of her pulse. The world rolls round obedient to your laws, but the heart of man is not of your kingdom, for in its birthplace [...] "a thousand years are but as yesterday." ...|$|E

The album was released on 3 July 2006, exclusively in Japan, following an argument with Costa's record label preventing a release in the United Kingdom. It failed to chart highly in Japan, and shortly after, Costa was dropped from the label. Only one single was released from the album, <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Think</b> of Me, which peaked at #19 on the UK Singles Chart.|$|E
500|$|... "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is an electropunk song, which {{consists}} of three songs welded together, according to journalist Peter Robinson: one with a samba rhythm, one with a sped-up sample and a breakbeat, and an intro from elsewhere. The track opens with Cole singing over a [...] "spooky" [...] instrumentation. Her vocals have been vocodered and she sings [...] "Cause I've been sitting back, no chance of falling / Hoping that nothing ever blows, no no / Boy, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> that loving would be / Nothing more than walking me home, no no". As the chorus begins, the song incorporates a sample from Scottish rock band Nazareth's 1975 track [...] "Hair of the Dog", and the group starts singing, [...] "Did you tell him? No no no / Give him kisses? No no no / Whisper honey? No no no / You're delicious? Hell no". John Murphy of musicOMH noted that [...] "Sexy! No No No.." [...] is not [...] "structured like a proper pop song - there's no verse-chorus-verse". The instrumentation of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is composed of multi-layered guitar riffs and [...] "euphoric woo woo-oo harmonies", while the song's structure follows as introduction, chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, middle eight, verse. A Newsround reviewer described the lyrical content, saying that Girls Aloud are [...] "trying {{a different approach to}} getting the guy", in that [...] "instead of being 'sexy', they've backed off." ...|$|R
