40|$|The {{discovery}} and colonisation of islands by humans has invariably resulted in their widespread ecological transformation. The small and isolated populations of many island taxa, and their {{evolution in the}} absence of humans and their introduced taxa, mean that they are particularly vulnerable to human activities. Consequently, even the most degraded islands are a focus for restoration, <b>eradication,</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> programmes to protect the remaining endemic and/or relict populations. Here, we build a framework that incorporates an assessment of the degree of change from multiple baseline reference periods using long-term ecological data. The use of multiple reference points may provide information on both the variability of natural systems and responses to successive waves of cultural transformation of island ecosystems, involving, for example, the alteration of fire and grazing regimes and the introduction of non-native species. We provide exemplification of how such approaches can provide valuable information for biodiversity conservation managers of island ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{frequency}} {{and distribution of}} specific structural farm elements {{in relation to the}} occurrence of rats was investigated on 24 German livestock farms, 18 in Lower Saxony and 6 in the Munsterland area. Using the interactive control programme BayTool® we also examined whether the allocation of baiting-points to these elements would result in complete rat eradication. Standardized rat control measures were applied with baiting-points allocated to six specific structural elements on these farms, and the feeding activity of rats was recorded for each of these elements and their position. Rat activity mainly occurred at five specific structural elements. Farms with rat infestations held a higher number of the element ‘old materials’ than rat-free farms. The allocation of rodenticide baiting-points to five specific structural elements is a precondition for complete rat eradication. Most rat feeding activity was observed at baiting-points allocated to ‘old materials’, ‘stacks’ (of construction materials), and ‘livestock’. Rat feeding activity was predominantly located outdoors at ‘old materials’ and ‘stacks’. The stringent allocation of baiting-points to six specific structural elements is a reliable means of rat <b>eradication</b> <b>and</b> rat <b>monitoring</b> on livestock farms. As most rat activity on livestock farms is expected outdoors a rodenticide must be chosen that only poses low secondary poisoning hazards...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{describes}} {{the transmission of}} border disease virus (BDV) from a persistently infected calf to seronegative heifers in early pregnancy, resulting in persistently infected fetuses. On day 50 of pregnancy (= day 0 of the infection phase), six heifers were co-housed in a free stall with a bull calf persistently infected with BDV (pi BVD) for 60 days. The heifers underwent daily clinical examination, and blood samples were collected regularly for detection of pestiviral RNA and anti-pestivirus antibodies. After day 60 (= day 110 of pregnancy), the heifers were slaughtered, and the fetuses and placentae underwent post-mortem and immunohistochemical examination and RT-PCR for viral RNA detection. RESULTS: Three heifers had mild viraemia from day 8 to day 14, and by day 40 all heifers had pestivirus antibodies identified as anti-BDV antibodies in the serum neutralisation test. The placenta of the three viraemic heifers had histological evidence of inflammation, and fetal organs from these heifers were positive for pestivirus antigen by immunohistochemical examination and for BD viral RNA by RT-PCR and sequencing. Thus, co-housing of heifers in early pregnancy with a pi-BDV calf led to seroconversion in all heifers and persistent fetal infection in three. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that pi-BDV cattle can infect other cattle and lead to persistent infection of the fetus in pregnant cows, BDV should not be ignored {{in the context of}} the mandatory BVDV <b>eradication</b> <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> program. This strongly suggests that BDV should be taken into account in BVD eradication and control programs...|$|E

LarsonVeterinary Services, {{a branch}} of Animal Plant Health Inspections Services, has the {{responsibility}} to protect our nation’s animals and animal products through disease control <b>and</b> <b>eradication</b> programs, surveillance <b>and</b> <b>monitoring.</b> During {{the course of my}} experience working with Veterinary Services, I learned about program diseases and the different ways veterinary medical field officers and epidemiologists work together to control, <b>monitor</b> <b>and</b> survey these diseases. Veterinary Services has been working to eliminate bovine tuberculosis in the United States since the early 1900 ’s. The Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Program has been largely successful but tuberculosis keeps resurfacing in pockets around the U. S. leading to the conclusion that there must be a wildlife reservoir. Mycobacterium bovis is the cause of bovine tuberculosis and is considered a zoonotic pathogen. M. bovis has been reported to infect a wide range of host species including cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, dogs, bison, badgers, possums, antelopes, elephants, seals, and humans(1). Through my experiences working with Veterinary Services, I was able to learn about the bovine tuberculosis <b>eradication</b> program <b>and</b> to explore different avenues in which M. bovis could be transmitted to humans. My report discusses the potential pathways for M. bovis zoonotic transmission to humans and my experiences working with Veterinary Services...|$|R

Seleniferous Shingle series soils and sandstone outcrops of section 27, T 48 N, R 71 W, Wyoming are mapped on aerial photography by {{their association with}} Astragalus bisulcatus. Chemical leachate analyses and atomic absorption methods reveal all studied Samsil and Shingle soils to contain acid, base, and water soluble selenium compounds, and that water extractions showed varied concentration behavior due to soil pH. Acid-soluble selenium {{is found to be}} associated with smectite. Statistical analyses confirm that A. bisulcatus presence has a weak influence on soil-lens organic selenium concentration, and determine the importance of other geobotanical factors for convertor presence. Environmental procedures of high selenium lens burial, convertor plant <b>eradication,</b> <b>and</b> revegetated site <b>monitoring</b> are recommended. Usage of density analysis and photographic enlargement are used to successfully produce both a control area and a Campbell County, Wyoming regional map of A. bisulcatus supportive soils and outcrops using Skylab photography...|$|R
40|$|Poa annua, {{an alien}} species {{reported}} from the Antarctic continent and many Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands, was accidentally {{introduced in the}} vicinity of the Polish Antarctic Station H. Arctowski. Recently the species has been found entering native plant communities. In almost 30 years it dispersed over 250 m from the site it was first observed and can therefore be considered invasive. We report the first steps to eradicate the species following the initial research to quantify the biology, ecology and genetics of the species. After detailed mapping of all 1439 tussocks located in the Arctowski Station area we removed 314 tussocks closest to a moss carpet formation (native plant community of high conservation value). All of the 49 tussocks growing in the Ecology Glacier forefield were removed. It is the biggest alien plant eradication act conducted so far in Antarctica. We plan to continue the <b>eradication</b> process <b>and</b> <b>monitor</b> the eradicated sites. This will provide valuable information on impacts and issuesrelated to removal of alien species in the maritime Antarctic and will help in informing future decisions on management of other plant invasions in the region. Given the increasing human traffic to the Antarctic and the associated risks of invasion our results will be important not only for Arctowski but also for the whole Antarctic region...|$|R
40|$|Most {{successful}} {{control or}} eradication {{programs have been}} implemented in uninhabited regions, where little or no consideration of socio-political factors has been required. A considerable challenge for invasion scientists and decision-makers lies in controlling and eradicating species from inhabited regions, where challenges related to community stakeholder perceptions {{of the need to}} act, animal rights and uncertainty surrounding the presence and abundance of invasive species can threaten program development and implementation. We interviewed senior policy advisors and scientists who developed and implemented European red fox eradication policies on the inhabited island state of Tasmania, Australia. Our aim was to understand how they perceived that scientific evidence and community stakeholders’ knowledge and preferences should be involved in developing and implementing policy for fox detection <b>and</b> <b>eradication.</b> Respondents perceived that scientific evidence was best used in determining the need to act, assessing risks, designing <b>eradication</b> operations <b>and</b> <b>monitoring</b> progress. Overall, they perceived that involving community stakeholders was important in creating socially acceptable eradication operations that enable access to private land to implement eradication options. Community stakeholders’ knowledge was perceived, largely by scientists, to be based on misinformation, misconceptions and mistrust in science and, therefore, of limited value in informing policy. Community stakeholders were therefore not viewed as equal partners in the policy-making process by scientists. Only those stakeholders who performed a clear function were considered valuable. We propose that increased likelihood of successful eradication of invasive species from inhabited areas can be achieved by using a functional approach to stakeholder inclusion, to prevent dissent and conflict by legitimizing varied knowledge and capacity, leading to co-production of knowledge within a co-management governance system...|$|R
40|$|Brucella {{species are}} obligate parasites having a {{preferred}} natural host {{that serves as}} a reservoir of the infection (Quinn et al., 1994). Infections by Brucellae have been found worldwide in a great variety of terrestrial wildlife species as well as a wide variety of marine mammals. It is important to distinguish between a spillover of infection from domestic animals and a sustainable infection in wild species (Godfroid, 2002). Some countries are considered to be officially brucellosis-free thanks to <b>eradication</b> programmes <b>and</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Wild animals, however, can be reservoirs of brucello-sis and sources of infection for domestic animals and humans (Szulowski and Pilaszek, 2000). The European hare (Lepus europaeus) and potentially the wild boar (Sus scrofa) are reservoirs of Brucella suis biotype 2 (Garin-Bastuji and Delcueillerie, 2001; Hubalek et al., 2002), which is considered to be non-pathogenic to humans. There is, however, a report of infection of a farmer by this biotype (Teyssou et al., 1989). As a disease occurring in nat-ural foci, it has a bi-component character spread-ing from one host to another by direct or indirect contact. Regarding this fact, the European hare brucellosis can be studied with respect to the host population density, ecological factors and types of habitats in the natural foci as well as long-term persistence in a given territory. The aim {{of the study was to}} analyse the distribu-tion of natural foci of brucellosis in the European hare in the Czech Republic on a quantitative basis using a geographic information system.

40|$|Abstract Introduced mammals {{are a major}} {{driver of}} {{extinction}} and ecosystem change, particularly on islands. Feral goats Capra hircus have been introduced to numerous islands worldwide and have had wholesale impacts on ecosystems. Techniques are now available, however, to eradicate goat populations from islands, providing a powerful conservation tool. Goats were removed from Pinta Island, Galápagos, Ecuador after a 30 -year eradication campaign, the largest removal of an insular goat population using ground-based methods. Over 41, 000 goats were removed during the initial hunting effort (1971 – 82). In the following decade the island was twice wrongly declared free of goats. During this period, the island was visited irregularly but no monitoring programme was implemented. A revised campaign over 1999 – 2003, which included improved hunting techniques <b>and</b> <b>monitoring,</b> removed the final goats from the island. The use of Judas goats was critical in locating the remaining goats and {{as a tool to}} confirm eradication. A systematic monitoring programme is critical for confirming <b>eradication</b> <b>and</b> preventing future reintroductions. An earlier monitoring programme would probably have resulted in earlier <b>eradication</b> <b>and</b> significant financial savings. Given limited resources, island conservation programmes elsewhere should strive to increase <b>eradication</b> efficiency <b>and</b> learn from past campaigns...|$|R
