5|$|The Finnieston Crane or Stobcross Crane is a disused giant {{cantilever}} crane (Hammerhead crane) in {{the centre of}} Glasgow, Scotland.

5|$|Because the Boeing 707 <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>in</b> production, the E-3 mission package {{has been}} fitted into the Boeing E-767 for the Japan Air Self Defense Forces. The E-10 MC2A was {{intended}} to replace USAF E-3s—along with the RC-135 and the E-8, but the E-10 program was canceled by the Department of Defense. The USAF is now performing a series of incremental improvements, mainly to avionics, to bring the E-3 up to current standards of performance. Boeing is flight-testing its Block 40/45 E-3s. This modified E-3 contains upgrades of the mission crew and air battle management sections, as well as significantly upgraded electronic equipment.|$|E
5|$|Carabane {{has many}} {{historic}} sites, {{such as the}} Catholic mission house built in 1880 which has since {{been turned into a}} hotel, a Brittany-style church building which <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>in</b> use, and a former slave-trade building. There is also a French cemetery where a Troupes de marine-Captain with the name Aristide Protet was shot with a poisoned arrow and buried standing {{up in front of the}} sea, according to his last wishes. Some tour guides falsely claim that this was Auguste Léopold Protet, the founder of the city of Dakar, but the name Aristide Protet is clearly shown on the tomb's plaque.|$|E
5|$|St Deiniol's <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>in</b> use; in 2006, a {{guide to}} the churches of Anglesey noted that no {{services}} had been held for a number of years, and added that ivy was growing across the building. The church's former parish has been merged with that of the adjoining village of Llanfairpwll, served by St Mary's, Llanfairpwll. As of January 2011, the church (without the grounds) was on sale for £50,000; it was suggested by the estate agents handling the sale that it {{could be used as a}} studio or for storage, subject to necessary consents being obtained.|$|E

5|$|The GR1A is the {{reconnaissance}} variant {{used by the}} RAF and RSAF, {{fitted with}} the TIRRS (Tornado Infra-Red Reconnaissance System), replacing the cannon. The RAF ordered 30 GR1As, 14 as GR1 rebuilds and 16 as new-builds. When the Tornado GR1s were upgraded to become GR4s, GR1A aircraft were upgraded to GR4A standard. The switch from low-level operations to medium/high-level operations means that the internal TIRRS <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>in</b> use. As the GR4A's internal sensors are no longer essential, the RAF's Tactical Reconnaissance Wing operate both GR4A and GR4 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Severn Beach Line {{declined}} {{over the}} latter half of the twentieth century, with passenger numbers falling significantly. Goods services at Montpelier ended in 1965, and all staff were withdrawn in 1967. The line was largely reduced to single track in 1970, with the northern platform abandoned and all trains using the remaining platform. The station building <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>in</b> railway use. Services had decreased to ten per day each direction by 2005, but have since increased to twenty-four trains per day.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{is roughly}} middle-aged; {{it has not}} changed {{dramatically}} {{for more than four}} billion years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five billion years. After hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>in</b> hydrostatic equilibrium, the core of the Sun will experience a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand to eventually become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his career}} Douglas {{attracted}} commissions from wealthy and important patrons. His first-known independent work was an ornament, which <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>in</b> existence, {{for the garden}} of the Honourable MrsCholmondeley. She was the sister-in-law of Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere, and {{it was from the}} 2ndBaron that Douglas received his first major commission, a considerable rebuilding of the south wing of his seat at Vale Royal Abbey in 1860. Around the same time, Lord Delamere commissioned him to build the church of St John the Evangelist at Over, Winsford, as a memorial to his first wife.|$|E
5|$|Running {{parallel}} to the main high street is a leat with a public footpath running along it. The leat runs from Head Weir, north of Cullompton, and takes its water from the Spratford Stream. It flows past three former watermills (Upper, Middle and Lower Mill) and then empties into the Culm near First Bridge. It is uncertain when the leat was first made but {{the south end of}} the leat and Lower Mill are shown on an early seventeenth-century map. The leat <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>in</b> use for powering mills and the Environment Agency is not interested in managing the leat nor keeping it flowing so the Cullompton Leat Conservancy Board was formed to restore and maintain the Leat in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically as Phacidium dentatum by Johann Karl Schmidt in 1817. Italian botanist Giuseppe De Notaris moved it to Lophodermium in 1847. In 1877, Pier Andrea Saccardo transferred it to Coccomyces, giving it its current name. The variety C.dentatus var. hexagonus, described by Otto Penzig and Saccardo from West Java, Indonesia in 1901, is sometimes applied to western US collections with large six-sided apothecia. However, its status is unclear, as the type <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>in</b> Saccardo's herbarium at the University of Padua, and Penzig's collection was destroyed during World War II. C.dentatus f. lauri {{was described by}} Heinrich Rehm in 1901, for a collection found growing on a species of Lauraceae in Rio Grande do Sul (southern Brazil). According to English botanist Martha Sherwood, who revised the genus Coccomyces in 1980, it is indistinguishable from the main type and should be considered synonymous.|$|E

5|$|Widgiemoolthalite {{occurs as}} a {{secondary}} mineral. It is found overlaying nickel sulfide that has undergone weathering, often in hollow spaces on gaspéite surfaces, and often exhibiting fibrous and rarely massive crystal habits. Other minerals associated with widgiemoolthalite include annabergite, carrboydite, dolomite, glaukosphaerite, hydrohonessite, kambaldaite, magnesite, nepouite, nullaginite, olivenite, otwayite, paratacamite, pecoraite, reevesite, retgersite, and takovite. Two additional unnamed minerals were also reported as associated secondary minerals from the 132 North site, the only locality at which widgiemoolthalite has been found. The 132 North waste pile from which widgiemoolthalite was first recovered <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>in</b> existence, {{making it a}} rare mineral. In support of the designation of an Anthropocene epoch, the existence and provenance of widgiemoolthalite, along with 207 other mineral species, have been cited as evidence of uniquely human action upon global stratigraphy.|$|E
5|$|From 1997 to 2009 {{the main}} {{collection}} was housed in this single new {{building and the}} collection of British and overseas newspapers was housed at Colindale. In July 2008 the Library {{announced that it would}} be moving low-use items to a new storage facility in Boston Spa in Yorkshire and that it planned to close the newspaper library at Colindale, ahead of a later move to a similar facility on the same site. From January 2009 to April 2012 over 200km of material was moved to the Additional Storage Building and is now delivered to British Library Reading Rooms in London on request by a daily shuttle service. Construction work on the Newspaper Storage Building was completed in 2013 and the newspaper library at Colindale closed on 8 November 2013. The collection has now been split between the St Pancras and Boston Spa sites. The British Library Document Supply Service (BLDSS) and the Library's Document Supply Collection is based on the same site in Boston Spa. Collections housed in Yorkshire, comprising low-use material and the newspaper and Document Supply collections, make up around 70% of the total material the library holds. The Library previously had a book storage depot in Woolwich, south-east London, which <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>in</b> use.|$|E
