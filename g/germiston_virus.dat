40|$|Clinical and {{serological}} responses {{investigated in}} rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys infected with either Bunyamwera or Germiston viruses were generally minimal or absent. A febrile reaction occurred {{in one of}} eight monkeys, and another monkey died unexplainably among those given Bunyamwera virus. All monkeys infected with <b>Germiston</b> <b>virus</b> by subcutaneous, intravenous, or intracerebral routes developed fevers, and all infections were relatively consistent in time of onset, duration, and level of viremia. Rhesus monkeys were also susceptible to infection by exposure to aerosolized <b>Germiston</b> <b>virus,</b> although viremias were irregular in these animals, and no fevers were detected. Serological responses to infections by Bunyamwera and Germiston viruses (hemagglutination inhibition, complement fixation, and neutralization tests) provided more reliable indications of infection than clinical response...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe 3 ' {{ends of the}} S and M {{messenger}} RNAs {{isolated from}} BHK 21 cells infected with <b>Germiston</b> <b>virus</b> were analyzed by mapping with RNase T 2 or nuclease S 1. The transcription termination signal {{was found to be}} located approximately 115 and 80 nucleotides upstream from the 3 ' end of the S and M genomic RNA templates, respectively. Both mRNAs were found to possess several adenosine residues at their 3 ' ends, but were not polyadenylated. They have acquired at their 5 ' end a heterologous 12 - to 18 -nucleotide-long sequence, which is not coded for by the virus. Sequencing of the 5 ' terminal region from single molecules cloned into pBR 327 revealed that these primers are rich in C and G residues and possess a U or a C adjacent to the viral sequence...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{complete}} {{sequence of}} the S segment of Germiston bunyavirus has been determined from plasmids containing S cDNA inserts. The S segment is 980 nucleotides long with the first 15 bases at the 3 ' end complementary to the first 15 bases at the 5 ' end. Three overlapping open reading frames (ORF) were identified in the viral complementary RNA strand. The first ORF codes for a polypeptide of 233 amino acids (Mr 26, 600) which is the nucleoprotein N. The second ORF codes for a polypeptide of 109 amino acids (Mr 11, 800) which corresponds to the NSS protein, also called p 12. Following this ORF, in the same frame, a third ORF which could encode a polypeptide of 75 amino acids was identified. Such a polypeptide {{has not yet been}} detected in infected cells. The N and NSS proteins of <b>Germiston</b> <b>virus</b> were compared with the corresponding proteins of La Crosse, snowshoe hare, and Aino viruses, and show a high extent of homology...|$|E
40|$|Ngari, Bunyamwera, Ilesha, and <b>Germiston</b> <b>viruses</b> {{are among}} the mosquito-borne human {{pathogens}} in the Orthobunyavirus genus, family Bunyaviridae, associated with febrile illness. Although the four orthobunyaviruses have been isolated from mosquito and/or tick vectors sampled from different geographic regions in Kenya, little is known of human exposure in such areas. We conducted a serologic investigation to determine whether orthobunyaviruses commonly infect humans in Kenya. Orthobunyavirus-specific antibodies were detected by plaque reduction neutralization tests in 89 (25. 8 %) of 345 persons tested. Multivariable analysis revealed age and residence in northeastern Kenya as risk factors. Implementation of acute febrile illness surveillance in northeastern Kenya will help to detect such infections.

40|$|Twenty African arboviruses, five alphaviruses, nine flaviviruses, three Bun-yamwera Group viruses, two Bwamba Group {{viruses and}} one ungrouped virus were titrated in {{parallel}} in 11 cell systems, in suckling mice and adult mice. The relative sensitivities {{of the in}} vitro and in vivo systems have been compared, The highest infectivities were obtained in suckling mice. Vero and LLC-MK 2 cells produced plaques with {{the greatest number of}} viruses and Semliki Forest virus grew most readily. Ntaya virus and Dengue I virus were difficult o culture in vitro and Zika virus yielded better in cell culture than in adult or suckling mice. In vitro and in vivo neutralization tests were made on human sera in groups of 5 o. Each group of sera was tested against one of five viruses, representatives of three of the arbovirus groups titrated. Good agreement was obtained between the two test systems with West Nile, O'nyong-nyong and Wesselsbron viruses but there were significant differences in results obtained with <b>Germiston</b> and Pongola <b>viruses...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceAnalysis of the RNAs {{present in}} BHK- 21 cells {{infected}} with <b>Germiston</b> <b>virus</b> {{showed that the}} transcripts from the L and M segments have a size {{similar to that of}} their template, whereas two types of complementary RNA are transcribed from the S segment. One, S 1, is a full-length "plus" RNA strand (antigenome), and the other, S 2, is an incomplete plus RNA strand which serves as mRNA for at least the synthesis of the N protein and a virus-specific nonstructural polypeptide, p 12. The 5 ' ends of these two transcripts appeared to be identical and complementary to the 3 ' ends of the viral RNA. Our results suggest that transcription of the S fragment either stops 100 to 150 nucleotides from the 5 ' end of the template, generating an S 2 molecule, or continues, generating an S 1 molecule. Neither the S 1 antigenome nor the S 2 mRNA molecules were polyadenylated at their 3 ' ends or capped at their 5 ' ends...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} of the M RNA segment of Germiston bunyavirus was determined from plasmids containing overlapping M cDNA inserts. The M segment is 4534 nucleotides long and contains a 50 -base-long inverted terminal repeat which can form a stable hydrogen-bonded secondary structure with a delta G of - 45. 8 kcal/mol. The RNA molecule complementary to viral RNA contains a single large open reading frame that encodes a 1437 amino acid-long protein with hydrophobic amino and carboxy terminal regions, which could represent signal and anchor sequences, respectively. It is presumed that this gene product is the polyprotein precursor to glycoproteins G 1 and G 2 and to the nonstructural polypeptide NSM. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the M RNA of Bunyamwera virus (prototype of the serogroup) and snowshow hare and La Crosse viruses (California serogroup) (Lees et al., 1986; Eshita and Bishop, 1984; Grady et al., 1987) were compared to those of <b>Germiston</b> <b>virus.</b> An overall amino acid sequence homology of 44 % was found between Germiston and snowshoe hare viruses and of 61 % between Germiston and Bunyamwera viruses. Most of the cysteines, three out of seven of the potential glycosylation sites, {{as well as the}} N and C terminal hydrophobic domains, are conserved between the four viruses...|$|E
40|$|The {{transcriptase}} {{associated with}} <b>Germiston</b> <b>virus</b> was assayed in an in vitro reaction in which transcription was coupled to translation by adding reticulocyte lysate under the appropriate salt conditions. When analyzed in polyacrylamide gels, the major transcripts migrated like authentic S mRNAs and possessed 12 - to 18 -base-long nontemplated 5 ' extensions {{similar to the}} 5 ' end of viral mRNAs. These transcripts were functional for the synthesis of at least proteins N and NSS. When translation was inhibited by adding protein synthesis inhibitors such as puromycin, cycloheximide, and anisomycin, a drastic inhibitory effect was observed on the synthesis of the complete S mRNA transcripts. However, initiation {{and part of the}} elongation process were still active, since short and incomplete RNA molecules with RNA primers at their 5 ' ends were synthesized. On the other hand, we found that edeine, another inhibitor of protein synthesis, stimulated not only synthesis of S mRNAs but also that of the full-length S cRNAs. Taking into account the mode of action of this antibiotic, we discuss the results, which emphasize the crucial role of active ribosomes during bunyavirus transcription and confirm the observations reported on La Crosse virions. Moreover, we showed that the RNA transcripts synthesized in a transcription-translation reaction were capped and that most of them have acquired the 5 ' terminal sequences of the alpha- or beta-globin mRNA...|$|E
40|$|As an {{approach}} to define the structural features within the 5 ' noncoding region of Yellow Fever virus (YFV) that modulate mRNA translational efficiency, we have studied how minor changes in this region affect the translational capacity in vitro of the corresponding mRNAs. A cDNA sequence coding {{for part of the}} YFV structural proteins was inserted into the vector pGEM 3 containing the bacteriophage T 7 promoter. This vector was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis to permit in vitro synthesis of transcripts containing only 5 vector nucleotides at their 5 ' end. The sequence of the YFV 5 ' untranslated region was further modified in order to alter the secondary structure of resulting T 7 transcripts. The efficiency of these messengers in programming cell-free translation systems varied from 1 - to 15 -fold, correlating inversely with the potential of the 5 ' untranslated sequences to form stable secondary structures. A chimaeric messenger containing the YFV 5 ' noncoding (5 ' NC) region linked to a heterologous mRNA derived from <b>Germiston</b> <b>virus,</b> was tested for its in vitro translatability. We found a translational efficiency about 2 -fold higher than that obtained with homologous transcripts, suggesting that YFV 5 ' NC region can function as a potential enhancer for gene expression. Data obtained with a series of plasmids constructed by linking the native YFV 5 'NC region to various coding regions of the YFV genome indicated that interactions between the untranslated sequence and protein coding regions influence mRNAs translational efficiency...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} {{the construction of}} plasmids which express fusion proteins representing various regions of <b>Germiston</b> <b>virus</b> M polyprotein. The fusion proteins were purified and inoculated into rabbits to produce antisera. The N- and C-terminal regions of the polyprotein induced specific antibodies which reacted with glycoproteins G 2 and G 1, respectively, and the intermediate region induced antibodies against the NSM polypeptide. This enabled us to determine the gene order: G 2 -NSM-G 1. Glycoproteins G 1 and G 2 form the spikes {{on the surface of}} the virion. We attempted to determine the structural organization of the glycoproteins by using a membrane-permeable cross-linking reagent, dimethyl suberimidate, but were unable to demonstrate that G 1 and/or G 2 form oligomeric structures. We analysed the glycoproteins further and showed that, like peripheral membrane proteins, the G 2 and NSM proteins are almost completely extracted into the aqueous phase of detergent Triton X 114 -treated cellular extracts, whereas glycoprotein G 1 is distributed in almost equal proportions between the aqueous and the detergent fractions. This indicates that G 1 is a membrane-associated protein, but its presence in the aqueous phase suggests that it is less hydrophobic than a typical membrane protein. We have also characterized the intracellular transport of the envelope glycoproteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. Pulse-chase labelling followed by immunoprecipitation and treatment with endoglycosidase H (endo H) showed that both G 1 and G 2 are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. Conversion to the endo H-resistant form is a rather slow process which takes more than 2 h. The mature G 1 and G 2 proteins present in the virion particle contain almost completely endo-H-resistant glycans...|$|E
