25|$|Busch won {{the pole}} for and led {{most of the}} race at Kansas, for 152 laps. However, a <b>fuel</b> <b>pickup</b> issue late hurt his chances of winning. Teammate Brad Keselowski took the victory. However, {{a few weeks later}} on June 26, Kurt finally got an elusive road course victory at Infineon Raceway. Not only did he win, but he also led the most laps with 76. Because of Brad Keselowski's injury during a {{practice}} crash at Road Atlanta, Busch filled in for Keselowski in his NASCAR Nationwide Series car for the Zippo 200 at Watkins Glen International, and Busch managed to get the pole and the win. By August 13, 2011, Busch had won 1/4 of all of his Nationwide races. On October 2, Busch won on two late restarts beating Jimmie Johnson in turn 1 leading the final 43 laps to grab his first ever victory at the Monster Mile at Dover. After a frustrating final five races, things came to a head when Busch launched a verbal tirade against an ESPN cameraman, and giving an obscene gesture to workers when a car blocked his path towards his pit garage following a transmission failure at the same race. Crew chief Steve Addington moved to Stewart-Haas Racing after the 2011 season.|$|E
50|$|Hawthorne's first Formula 2 {{race was}} the Jochen Rindt Memorial Trophy in Thruxton, which was valid {{for both the}} British and European Formula 2 Championship.

50|$|Lap 17 {{was a bad}} one for Ferrari as Piquet finally passed Pironi for fourth, and Villeneuve retired with {{a broken}} driveshaft. On lap 25, Reutemann took the lead from Patrese just a lap before Patrese pitted with a {{misfiring}} engine. He rejoined the race with a new spark box, but after two more stops for the same problem, finally retired with a broken <b>fuel</b> <b>pickup.</b>|$|E
50|$|Throughout the race, Riccardo Patrese, Ivan Capelli and Eddie Cheever {{had been}} in close contact. When Capelli retired on lap 21 with a gearbox failure, Patrese and Cheever carried on the battle alone. After lap 51, the fight was for second place, with Patrese ahead. Despite a <b>fuel</b> <b>pickup</b> problem with his engine, Cheever mounted a {{challenge}} in the closing laps until his front brakes and one rear brake failed. He finished in third place.|$|E
50|$|Allmendinger began {{reporting}} <b>fuel</b> <b>pickup</b> {{issues on}} lap 57. He made an unscheduled pit stop on lap 60. Justin Allgaier {{ran out of}} fuel on lap 65, but coasted the car back to pit road and the race stayed green. Johnson hit pit road on lap 67 and the lead was given back to Kurt Busch. The third caution of the race flew on lap 74 when J. J. Yeley, exiting turn 10, got loose and hit the inside wall. Johnson opted not to pit and reassumed the lead.|$|E

50|$|With two laps left, Kevin Harvick bobbled {{entering}} a turn and pushed up into second place Tony Stewart. Stewart hit the wall, bringing out a caution, and finished {{as the last}} car on the lead lap in 14th. Denny Hamlin was leading at the time but he suddenly slowed after he had <b>fuel</b> <b>pickup</b> problems and quickly faded to finish eighth. The race went six laps past its scheduled length due to the green-white-checker finish rule, and was won by Jeff Burton. Richard Childress Racing finished 1-2-3 {{for the first time}} in team history, with Harvick finishing second and Clint Bowyer third.|$|E
5000|$|... 1984: Mario Andretti won {{the pole}} position, led 34 of the 50 laps, and {{dominated}} {{the race to}} win {{for the second consecutive}} year. Andretti's nearest competitors all suffered trouble, allowing Andretti to cruise to victory. Danny Sullivan suffered an engine fire, Bobby Rahal experienced <b>fuel</b> <b>pickup</b> problems, and Roberto Guerrero twice spun off course. Andretti won by a margin of over 1 minute and 14 seconds and the race went caution-free. Tom Sneva led the points standings going into the race, but blew an engine on lap 33. Andretti took over the points lead, and would go on to win the 1984 CART championship.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the season}} it was {{announced}} that Stewart had been medically cleared to race. Stewart mentioned during Pre-Season Thunder that his leg would be about 65% healed going into Daytona. Stewart ran the Sprint Unlimited, but was collected in a nine-car crash. This was something that Stewart had dreaded, but exited his race car under his own power, and without any pain. Stewart entered the Daytona 500 in his backup car, starting {{from the rear of the}} field. After the 6 hour and 22 minute rain delay, the race resumed, but just shy of half way, Stewart's <b>fuel</b> <b>pickup</b> began to fail. He and his crew took his race car behind the wall, got the problem fixed, and finished the race 27 laps down.|$|E

50|$|The Autodromo Dino Ferrari had {{received}} safety upgrades {{from the previous}} year, including slight track modifications after the Variante Alta chicane and extended runoff areas at the Rivazza complex. Alain Prost (McLaren-TAG) dominated the race after Ayrton Senna (Lotus-Renault) and Nigel Mansell (Williams-Honda) retired early, before almost running out of fuel, three corners from the chequered flag. Frantically weaving the car {{back and forth to}} slosh the last drops of <b>fuel</b> into the <b>pickup,</b> he managed to keep it running just long enough to creep over the line and win the race (his McLaren team mate Keke Rosberg was classified 5th despite running dry 2 laps from the finish, a problem attributed to Rosberg using too much boost). Nelson Piquet brought his Williams home in second place only 7.645 seconds behind Prost, while Austrian Gerhard Berger finished third to score his and the Benetton team's first Formula One podium finish.|$|R
5000|$|... 1983: The Indy cars {{returned}} to Mid-Ohio {{for the second}} time, {{as part of the}} CART PPG Indy Car World Series. Polesitter and hometown favorite Bobby Rahal led the first 18 laps, but was forced to pit with a <b>fuel</b> <b>pickup</b> problem. Teo Fabi assumed the lead on lap 27, and never relinquished it. Contenders John Paul Jr. and Al Unser Jr. both fell by the wayside, while second place Mario Andretti was never able to mount a strong challenge on Fabi. Fabi stretched out to a 45-second lead at one point, and made his final pit stop without losing the lead. Fabi won by 25 seconds over Andretti. Despite two unscheduled pit stops, Bobby Rahal still managed to come home in third.|$|E
5000|$|Like the {{previous}} Chase races at Dover, Kansas, {{and most recently}} at Talladega, a great portion of the 12 Chase drivers would have trouble. Many analysts expected defending champion Jimmie Johnson to walk away with another Charlotte victory, as he had won three consecutive 600's, including two sweeps in 2004 and 2005. He continued with his domination, leading 95 of 337 laps before an unexpected spin on lap 231 took him out of contention. His teammate, points leader Jeff Gordon picked up the lead, trading it with teammate Kyle Busch and Clint Bowyer. After an oil spill by Jeff Green, Gordon and Busch began experiencing <b>fuel</b> <b>pickup</b> problems. Fearing a wreck, owner Rick Hendrick told Kyle to race Gordon clean. Although he attempted a [...] "bump and run" [...] on Gordon, it gave Ryan Newman the opportunity to shoot back into the lead. Ryan had victory in his sights until he surprisingly spun out with 3 to go, giving the lead back to Gordon, who had not finished a Lowe's race since 2004. However, Gordon would hold off Bowyer and Busch for his first Lowe's win since 1999.|$|E
50|$|Busch won {{the pole}} for and led {{most of the}} race at Kansas, for 152 laps. However, a <b>fuel</b> <b>pickup</b> issue late hurt his chances of winning. Teammate Brad Keselowski took the victory. However, {{a few weeks later}} on June 26, Kurt finally got an elusive road course victory at Infineon Raceway. Not only did he win, but he also led the most laps with 76. Because of Brad Keselowski's injury during a {{practice}} crash at Road Atlanta, Busch filled in for Keselowski in his NASCAR Nationwide Series car for the Zippo 200 at Watkins Glen International, and Busch managed to get the pole and the win.

500|$|Another memorable {{race that}} year for Prost {{was at the}} San Marino Grand Prix. He was {{cruising}} to victory when his car began {{to run out of}} fuel three corners from the chequered flag. Frantically weaving the car back and forth to slosh the last drops of <b>fuel</b> into the <b>pickup,</b> he managed to keep it running just long enough to creep over the line and win the race (Prost commented after the race that when his car started running dry he immediately thought to himself [...] "shit, I am going to lose this race again", referring to his 1985 disqualification at Imola). It happened again at the German Grand Prix: while running in fourth position, Prost's car ran out of fuel on the finishing straight of the last lap. Instead of retiring at a time in the season when points were critical, Prost got out of his car and tried to push it to the finish, to great applause from the crowd. The finish line was too far, though, and he never reached it. He was eventually classified sixth in the race, as the seventh-placed car (the Brabham-BMW of Derek Warwick) was a lap behind.|$|R
50|$|While most {{tanks are}} manufactured, some fuel tanks are still {{fabricated}} by metal craftsmen or hand-made {{in the case}} of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive,aircraft, motorcycles, and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank areaddressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening holes. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, <b>fuel</b> <b>pickup,</b> drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added {{at the end of the}} fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently brazed or soldered to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and soldered, or flanged and brazed (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then welded. Once the soldering, brazing or welding is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.|$|E
50|$|The Diamond Hill Plywood 200 {{was held}} on May 9 at Darlington Raceway in Darlington, South Carolina. Carl Edwards won the pole. Denny Hamlin who won the {{previous}} race and was the fastest in the two final practice sessions hit the wall on his qualifying lap and failed to qualify. Carl Edwards, who won the pole, chose to start {{on the outside of}} Bowyer, the second-place qualifier. But scraped the wall while racing Bowyer on the opening lap. Edwards' bad luck would continue when on lap 2 his #60 Ford blew the right-front tire and smacked the Turn 3 wall causing his race to end early. Matt Kenseth led Tony Stewart by more than two seconds with 46 laps left in the race but Kenseth made a pit stop on lap 121, complaining that his wheels were chattering. The crew put on four tires and sent Kenseth back on the track, but Kenseth wrecked in Turn 4 on lap 128 trying to catch the first car one lap down. The race was red flagged with 19 laps remaining as track crews cleaned up after Kenseth's wreck. David Ragan spun on lap 138 and hit the wall bringing out the seventh caution. Mark Martin's engine stalled on the restart with three laps remaining due to <b>fuel</b> <b>pickup</b> problems, triggering a six-car wreck, the race was red flagged again for cleanup. Stewart led the field to the restart of a green-white-checker finish on lap 148. Tony Stewart pulled away from Clint Bowyer and went on to win his first race at Darlington Raceway. It was Stewart's fourth victory in the 2008 Nationwide Series, and the sixth of his career. It marked the eighth win for Joe Gibbs Racing in the 2008 Nationwide Series, and the fourth consecutive victory for the team's #20 car.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, Spyder updated the NF-10 and {{produced}} the NF-11. Initially, both NF-10s were updated {{to the new}} specification; however, as the season continued, two new cars were built. Like the NF-10, it featured a 5-litre Chevrolet V8 engine, and the car was still based on the Lola T333CS. Like 1978, the Can-Am season started at Road Atlanta; this time, however, Keke Rosberg won the race {{in one of the}} Newman-Freeman Racing NF-11s, whilst Forbes-Robinson finished third. The team was almost as successful in the next race, held at Charlotte Motor Speedway; Forbes-Robinson finished second, and Rosberg came third. For Mosport, three cars were entered; Rosberg, Forbes-Robinson, and Randolph Townsend; Forbes-Robinson took another second place, whilst Rosberg and Townsend both crashed out (on lap 28 and 25 respectively) of the race. Townsend didn't race at Mid-Ohio, but Rosberg took second, and Forbes-Robinson took third. Townsend returned at Watkins-Glen, and Rosberg took his second win of the season; however, Townsend was classified 13th, with a broken oil line forcing him out after 30 laps, and Forbes-Robinson also hit trouble after 18 laps, and was classified 20th. Road America was an unsuccessful event for the team as all three drivers retired; Townsend with a blown engine after 20 laps, Rosberg with valve issues after 19 laps, and Forbes-Robinson with suspension failure after 15 laps. The next race, held at Brainerd International Raceway, saw Forbes-Robinson finish second, although Townsend was limited to ninth place due to a <b>fuel</b> <b>pickup</b> issue, and Rosberg didn't complete the first lap due to a broken rod. Forbes-Robinson repeated his 1978 victory at Trois-Rivières; Rosberg finished seventh, having blown his engine, and Townsend finished 15th. Forbes-Robinson then finished second at Laguna Seca, with Howdy Holmes (replacing Townsend) finishing fourth, and Rosberg sixth, despite the latter crashing in practice. The final round of the season, held at Riverside, saw Forbes-Robinson take third, Townsend finish seventh, and Rosberg finish 14th, having crashed out after 44 laps. Forbes-Robinson finished second in the Driver's championship, with 45 points, whilst Rosberg finished fourth, with 29. Newman-Freeman Racing also won the Team's championship, with 61 points; they beat Carl A. Haas Racing Teams,Ltd. by a single point.|$|E
