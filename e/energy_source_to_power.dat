In this work, we propose a novel sensor node architecture for a wireless outdoor CO monitoring unit. To guarantee an autonomous operation, the sensor node is supported by a hybrid power supply, which takes advantage of both wind and solar ambient <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> the node and to charge super capacitors that act as energy buffers. Also, the gas measurement logic is developed such that the energy consumption is minimized. An additional backup energy storage is based on a Li-ion battery. Using an electrochemical CO sensor, we secure the low power consumption of the node without degrading the sensing capabilities. Our solution can be applied for CO monitoring in urban areas and outdoor industrial facilities. Keywords—CO wireless gas sensor, gas monitoring, energy harvesting, power management I...|$|R

We then propose further modifications to increase the utilization of those destinations that are powered by renewable energy sources: Manycast Drop at Greenest Nodes (MA-DGN). The potential for emission reduction by those algorithms is two-fold: the data is transported in the most efficient way, and processed at the greenest available data centers. We compare the approaches by simulating realistic quantities of dynamic traffic. We assume heterogeneously distributed and time-dependent availability of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>sources</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> nodes throughout the net-work.

40|$|Abstract—Green {{energy is}} {{emerging}} as a promising alternative <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> network devices in next-generation wireless networks. Different from traditional energy, green energy is replenished from nature, e. g., solar and wind, and is highly dependent on the capacities and locations of the electronic devices. As such, the fundamental design criterion in the network deployment and management is shifted from energy efficiency to energy sustainability due to the sustainable nature of green energy. In this paper, we study the network resource management issues in next-generation wireless networks with sustainable energy supply. Our objective is to deploy the minimal number of green RNs, i. e., RNs powered by green energy, and optimize resource allocation to ensure full network connectivity and users ’ Quality of Service (QoS) requirements can be fulfilled with the harvested energy based on the cost threshold. To this end, the RN placement and sub-carrier allocation (RNP-SA) issues are jointly formulated into a mixed integer non-linear programming problem. Two low-complexity heuristic algorithms, namely RNP-SA with top-down/bottom-up algorithms (RNP-SAt/b), are presented to solve the non-linear programming problem in different network scenarios. Extensive simulations show that the proposed algorithms provide simple yet efficient solutions and offer important guidelines on network deployment and resource management in a green radio network with sustainable energy sources.

The {{increase}} in {{awareness of the}} environmental problems resulting from emissions released from vehicles have forced governments and car manufactures to invest more time in to the designing a vehicle that is an alternative to petrol driven vehicles. This dissertation aims to introduce a control strategy to manage the flow of energy of different power sources that may be found on a vehicle. Hybrid vehicles are a possible solution to reducing carbon emissions that play a part in global warming. In this dissertation, di erent hybrid vehicles are de ned and their components discussed in detail. The possibility of more than one <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> <b>to</b> <b>power</b> the vehicle introduces more exibility in terms of the drivetrain but this increases the complexity of the energy control management. The goal is to optimize the energy control management to reduce fuel consumption and therefore reduce emissions. Operating procedures for the various hybrid con gurations are discussed. Simulations of the Energy Management System of the hybrid electric vehicle are used to develop the control optimization algorithm. Various control optimization procedures are discussed. Satisfactory results from the simulations allow the implementation of the hybrid onto a platform entered into the South African Solar Challenge 2010, which covered a distance of 4000 km. The Energy Management system selected for the parallel hybrid electric vehicle demonstrated fuel savings, which meant a reduction in emissions, which is the goal of any hybrid vehicle.

To explain this, Wegener set forth the hypothesis that the Earth must be expanding as a whole. Wegener?s inability to provide an adequate explanation of the forces and energy source responsible for continental drift and the prevailing belief that the Earth was a rigid solid body resulted in the acrimonious dismissal of his theories. Today, that the continents are receding from each other is no longer a point of debate but a sacrosanct pillar of modern geology and geophysics.

The E. coli maltose transporter has long {{served as a}} prototype to understand the molecular mechanism of this superfamily. MalG 511, a binding protein independent mutant of the maltose transporter shows a characteristic basal activity and an interesting biphasic behavior, {{with low levels of}} maltose binding protein (MBP) stimulating transport activity while higher levels inhibit transport activity. Remarkably, restoring effect of MBP suppressor mutants obtained at high, inhibitory concentrations of MBP turns it into an attractive model to understand regulatory mechanisms in disease related ABC transporters which show high basal activities, as in P-glycoprotein and CFTR. The events in the catalytic cycle of MalG 511, in presence and absence of MBP and suppressor mutant, have been studied by site directed spin labeling EPR spectroscopy. Vanadate trapping experiments revealed a closed transition state, indicating MalG 511 uses the same overall mechanism of transport as other ABC transporters. However, we found that the MalG 511 mutation shifted the equilibrium towards the semi-open state of the transporter that has higher affinity for MBP; this explains the inhibitory role of MBP at higher concentrations. ^ An essential ABC like transporter, FtsEX, and its interacting partner, an essential amino hydrolase, PcsB, have been characterized from a serious respiratory pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ATPase activity of FtsEX has been proposed to regulate hydrolase activity of PcsB through an interaction between extracellular loop of FtsX and coiled coil domain of PcsB. FtsX and FtsE have been individually expressed and purified. Purification of FtsX and its reconstitution into nanodiscs as a dimer has also been optimized successfully. Glutaraldehyde crosslinking also confirmed the imeric state of FtsX. FtsE has been characterized for ATP binding and hydrolysis. Early steps toward producing the complex for biophysical studies have been taken by demonstrating that FtsE can be pulled down by coexpressing with His tagged FtsX. ...|$|E
