5|$|Most {{countries}} place {{dietary supplements}} {{in a special}} category under the general umbrella of foods, not drugs. As a result, the manufacturer, and not the government, has the responsibility of ensuring that its <b>dietary</b> <b>supplement</b> products are safe before they are marketed. Regulation of supplements varies widely by country. In the United States, a <b>dietary</b> <b>supplement</b> is defined under the <b>Dietary</b> <b>Supplement</b> Health and Education Act of 1994. There is no FDA approval process for dietary supplements, and no requirement that manufacturers prove the safety or efficacy of supplements introduced before 1994. The Food and Drug Administration must rely on its Adverse Event Reporting System to monitor adverse events that occur with supplements. In 2007, the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, part III took effect, regulating Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) in the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, or holding operations for dietary supplements. Even though product registration is not required, these regulations mandate production and quality control standards (including testing for identity, purity and adulterations) for dietary supplements. In the European Union, the Food Supplements Directive requires that only those supplements that have been proven safe can be sold without a prescription.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{many health}} care {{professionals}} (HCPs) in the United States have been educated about and recommend <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements,</b> {{little is known about}} their personal use of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> and factors associated with their use. Methods We surveyed HCPs at the point of their enrollment in an on-line course about <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> between September, 2004 and May, 2005. We used multivariable logistic regression to analyze demographic and practice factors associated with use of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements.</b> Results Of the 1249 {{health care professionals}} surveyed, 81 % reported having used a vitamin, mineral, or other non-herbal <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> in the last week. Use varied by profession with highest rates among nurses (88 %), physician assistants or nurse practitioners (84 %) and the lowest rates among pharmacists (66 %) and trainees (72 %). The most frequently used supplements were multivitamins (60 %), calcium (40 %), vitamin B (31 %), vitamin C (30 %), and fish oil (24 %). Factors associated with higher supplement use were older age, female, high knowledge of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements,</b> and discussing <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> with patients. In our adjusted model, nurses were more likely than other professionals to use a multivitamin and students were more likely to use calcium. Conclusion Among HCPs enrolled in an on-line course about <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements,</b> women, older clinicians, those with higher knowledge and those who talk with patients about <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> had higher use of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements.</b> Additional research is necessary to understand the impact of professionals' personal use of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> on communication with patients about them. </p...|$|R
30|$|Patients with bipolar {{disorder}} commonly take <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> {{in addition to}} prescription medications. About three out of ten patients used <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements,</b> with two in ten of these taking supplements for the long-term.

40|$|Background: Patients who undergo surgery {{appear to}} use <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> {{significantly}} {{more frequently than}} the general population. Because they contain pharmacologically active compounds, <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> may affect coagulation and platelet function during the perioperative period through direct effects, pharmacodynamic interactions, and pharmacokinetic interactions. However, in this regard, limited {{studies have been conducted}} that address the pharmacological interactions of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements.</b> To avoid possible bleeding risks during surgery, information about the potential complications of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> during perioperative management is important for physicians. Methods: Through a systematic database search of all available years, articles were identified in this review if they included <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> and coagulation/platelet function, while special attention was paid to studies published after 1990. Results: Safety concerns are reported in commercially available <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements.</b> Effects of the most commonly used natural products on blood coagulation and platelet function are systematically reviewed, including 11 herbal medicines (echinacea, ephedra, garlic, ginger, ginkgo, ginseng, green tea, kava, saw palmetto, St John’s wort, and valerian) and four other <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> (coenzyme Q 10, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, fish oil, and vitamins). Bleeding risks of garlic, ginkgo, ginseng, green tea, saw palmetto, St John’s wort, and fish oil are reported. Cardiovascular instability was observed with ephedra, ginseng, and kava. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions between <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> and drugs used in the perioperative period are discussed. Conclusions: To prevent potential problems {{associated with the use of}} <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements,</b> physicians should be familiar with the perioperative effects of commonly used <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements.</b> Since the effects of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> on coagulation and platelet function are difficult to predict, it is prudent to advise their discontinuation before surgery...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: In {{the last}} decades, <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> {{consumption}} {{has increased in}} the Western world for all age groups. The long-term potentially dangerous effects related to an indiscriminate consumption of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> are still unknown and are becoming {{a matter of public}} health concern. Therefore, the aims of the present study were: to explore the contribution of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> to micronutrient daily intake, and to evaluate awareness and knowledge about <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements.</b> Methods: Participants (age ranging from 14 to 18 years) were recruited among students attending 8 high schools in the province of Frosinone (Italy). An anonymous questionnaire, composed of 12 multiple-choice items, was administered to all the participants. T-test and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to describe differences between means of the groups, while the chi-square test was used to compare observed and expected frequencies. The logistic regression model, aimed at identifying the characteristics of potential consumers of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements,</b> Results: A total of 686 teenagers (288 males and 398 females, average age: 17, 89 ∓ 0, 91 years) participated in the study. The 83, 6 % of participants affirmed to be aware of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements.</b> 239 participants consumed dietary supplements: 118 males and 121 females. 49, 1 % of females consumed <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> less than twice a week, whereas 43, 6 % of males consumed <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> from 2 to 5 times per week. Statistically significant differences emerged between the genders with respect to the source of information regarding <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements,</b> the perceived indications for their use, and the choice of the store/place to purchase them. Discussion: Findings in the present study provide insight into the consumption of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> among young Italians, highlighting the need to foster further awareness among adolescents about the correct use of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements,</b> especially in terms of indications and contraindications. © 2014 del Balzo et al...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> {{have grown}} in {{popularity}} in recent years, with multivitamins the most commonly used. As the awareness of <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements</b> continues to increase, there are more chances for consumers to misuse or misunderstand the risks of taking <b>dietary</b> <b>supplements.</b> Public relations, physicians, and pharmaceutical companies should work to educate the consumer about the uses and risks of supplements.
