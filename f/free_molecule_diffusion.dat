40|$|A {{molecular}} {{dynamic model}} based on Lennard-Jones Potential, the interaction force between two particles, molecular diffusion, and radial distribution function (RDF) is presented. The diffusion of the hydrated ion, triggered by both Grotthuss and vehicle mechanisms, {{is used to}} study the proton transfer in Nafion 117. The hydrated ion transfer mechanisms {{and the effects of}} the temperature, the water content in the membrane, and the electric field on the diffusion of the hydrated ion are analyzed. The molecular dynamic simulation results are in good agreement with those reported in the literature. The modeling results show that when the water content in Nafion 117 is low, H 3 O+ is the main transfer ion among the different hydrated ions. However, at higher water content, the hydrated ion in the form of H+(H 2 O) 2 is the main transfer ion. It is also found that the negatively charged sulfonic acid group as the fortified point facilitates the proton transfer in Nafion 117 better than the <b>free</b> water <b>molecule.</b> The <b>diffusion</b> of the hydrated ion can be improved by increasing the cell temperature, the water content in Nafion, and the electric field intensity...|$|R

A study of the packing in the unit cell identifies a new type of packing scheme in which eight (partial) molecules participate: each apex H atom of one protruding Si−H bond of every molecule points to the corner of an equilateral triangle having 2. 631 Å sides. All hydrogen atoms in both the <b>free</b> <b>molecule</b> and in the solid state carry negative partial charges.

30|$|The {{principle}} of water <b>molecule</b> <b>diffusion</b> evaluated using MRI {{in the human}} body was firstly reported in 1985 [9] to assess microstructural changes in fibre architecture involved in pathologic conditions of the central nervous system [10]. Molecular diffusion refers to the random translational motion of molecules, also called Brownian motion, as a result from the thermal energy they carry [11]. Diffusion can be studied by using spin-echo single-shot echo-planar imaging sequences [12] with adequate fat suppression. DWI sequences have technical parameters not different from those of conventional sequences, such as time of echo (TE) and time of repetition (TR), but also an additional parameter, i.e. the b-value [11]. This parameter represents the degree of diffusion weighting of the sequence, determined by the application of specific magnetic field gradients, and is measured in s/mm 2. The amount of water <b>molecule</b> <b>diffusion</b> is quantified by the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)—obtained by interpolating the results given with different applied b-values—which provides indirect information also about the arrangement of the surrounding structures.|$|R

Sonic orifice solutions are approximate, developed using a fair simulacrum fitted to the <b>free</b> <b>molecule</b> solution. Expressions are also developed for a spherically-symmetric thermal expansion (M = 0). CND solutions are found for the most general paths relative to these sources and briefly explored. It is determined that the maximum CND from a distant location through directed effusion and sonic orifice cases occurs along the path parallel to the source plane that intersects the plume axis. For the effusive case this value is exactly twice the CND found along the ray originating from that point of intersection and extending to infinity along the plume's axis. For sonic plumes this ratio is reduced to about 4 / 3. For high Mach number cases the maximum CND will be found along the axial centerline path.

40|$|Ionic polymer-metal {{composites}} (IPMCs), a {{new type}} of smart material, offer the attractive features of high sensitivity and light weight for developing novel designs in the fields of dynamic sensors, robotic actuators and artificial muscles. The non-linear water <b>molecule</b> <b>diffusion</b> resistance force exists in the process of sodium ion migration, which may cause a significant effect on the dynamic electro-mechanical properties of this kind of material. In this paper, Tadokoro's model constructed by taking the electrostatic force, the viscous resistance force, the sodium ion diffusion force, and the water <b>molecule</b> <b>diffusion</b> resistance force into account was applied for simulation of electro-mechanical properties of IMPC. By coupling these forces and based on the principle of internal force equilibrium and the laws of motion, a multi-field finite element method (MFFEM) was derived using the dynamic electro-mechanical model, and a numerical solving scheme was proposed. Using the MFFEM, the electro-active behaviours of an IPMC beam have been simulated and discussed. The simulation results show that the water <b>molecule</b> <b>diffusion</b> resistance force has various effects on an IPMC beam, such as the water concentration, charge density of sodium ions and internal equilibrium forces. Furthermore, MFFEM has also been applied to study the migration speed of the hydrated sodium ions, electric-field intensity and bending displacement distribution across the thickness direction of the IPMC beam. Compared with the experimental findings reported by other investigators, it has been demonstrated that the proposed method provided a more realistic and scientific way to predict the electro-mechanical behaviours of IPMC by introduction of the non-linear force component in the model. Hence, the accuracy of prediction may also be improved and more information may be provided for developing new IPMC devices. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
