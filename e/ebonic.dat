IGN argued in favor of this point, citing his use of [...] "stilted slang," [...] and stating that the character stands out amongst the cast because [...] "his dialog is written as if it was run through a broken <b>ebonic</b> translator," [...] further noting a trend in Japanese games to apply such dialogue to characters based on their skin color. Journalist Jeremy Parish agreed that the character was racist, although he argued that cultural gaps between Japan and the United States, plus the lack of American translators for Final Fantasy VII may have been contributing factors, arguing that the likeness between Barret and Mr. T was possibly an attempt to make a character that appealed to Americans, as the actor did.|$|E

Using communication accommodation theory, this investigation into African American communication focuses on whether individuals would adapt to persons who speak differently. The participants are students at a mid-western American university {{with the majority of}} the population Caucasian American. Three conditions of <b>Ebonics</b> were displayed 1) light <b>Ebonics,</b> 2) none (Standard English) and 3) heavy <b>Ebonics.</b> The results indicate a perception of using heavy/light <b>Ebonics</b> in the classroom and at work less appropriate. Speaking Standard English was perceived as the more appropriate dialect over the heavy and light <b>Ebonics</b> conditions. Additionally, the results suggest a tendency for participants to diverge from the heavy/light <b>Ebonics</b> conditions and less from the Standard English condition. These results could be used to decrease problems associated with inter-ethnic communication...|$|R

The game’s main storyline represents racial issues in the United States especially the African-American stereotypes. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the gameplay, storyline, and cutscene of the game. The study uses ergodic, textual, and contextual theories to analyze the data and library research to compile the data. Library research is used to get literary and stereotype theories. There are five stereotypes showed in this game, namely, African-Americans have savage behaviour; African-Americans are poor people who live in ghettos; African-Americans tend to love hip-hop as well as raps music;African-Americans use <b>ebonic</b> language; and African-American males love to wear saggy pants or baggy clothes...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis of}} this paper is that no {{substantive}} and impartial debate about the pedagogical value of using <b>Ebonics</b> in the classroom could be held in the United States media because America 2 ̆ 7 s prescriptive attitude towards <b>Ebonics</b> does not allow fair and objective consideration of the issue. In presenting this theme I will discuss language ideologies in general and prescription in particular as a common attitude towards language. Prescription with respect to <b>Ebonics</b> usually takes the form of language prejudice. I will conclude with an introduction to one area of language planning, status planning, in which language planners try to improve the status of a dialect or language by selecting a goal, planning the necessary research, and devising a marketing or diffusion plan...|$|R

40|$|John Rickford (1990) {{states that}} “ 80 %- 90 % of African Americans speak {{some form of}} Black English”, also known as “Ebonics” or “African American Vernacular English” (AAVE). In 1996, when the Oakland School Board {{proposed}} its resolution designating <b>Ebonics</b> as their students’ primary language, many African Americans outright rejected the School Board’s reference and description of their language (Smitherman, 2000, 150). Among them were Baby boomers (1940 - 1960 s), {{who participated in the}} debates, and the Generation X’ers, (1960 s- 1980 s), who were informed by the debates. A recent interview of members from both groups show that there is continued skepticism regarding the legitimacy of <b>Ebonics</b> as a language. Their resistance offers much to learn about intergroup relations and conflict. This research explores these components of group identity by examining the in-group language responses {{to the question of whether}} <b>Ebonics,</b> AAVE, or Black English is a language...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{interpretations of}} the {{controversial}} issues in the resolution include the idea that <b>Ebonics</b> is not a vernacular or dialect of English, {{that it is a}} separate language; a member of the African language family; that African Americans particular language and their dialects; that speakers of <b>Ebonics</b> should qualify for federally funded programs traditionally restricted to bilingual populations; and that students would be taught American Standard English via <b>Ebonics.</b> The Rev. Jesse Jackson condemned the resolution, saying [...] "I understand the attempt to reach out to these children, but this is an unacceptable surrender, borderlining on disgrace." [...] His comments were seconded by former Secretary of Education William Bennett, former New York governor Mario Cuomo, and Senator Joe Lieberman. [...] Jackson would later reverse his position, attributing his initial opposition to a misunderstanding of the school district's proposal. He said, [...] "They're not trying to teach Black English as a standard language. They're looking for tools to teach children standard English so they might be competitive." ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Ebonics</b> {{controversy}} revealed surprising public {{rejection of}} the ideas of academic linguists. The intellectual history of the situation provides a reasonable explanation. Linguists lack consensus themselves, while the public consensus includes inherent contradictions. Academic and public ideas of language came into conflict over <b>Ebonics</b> in part because linguists attempted to impose their own ideas on the public, {{in part because of}} confusion over terminology, and in part because the situation was entangled in social politics. The lessons of the affair suggest an approach to language and public policy in which linguists come to terms with public views of language...|$|R
5000|$|A two-year-old term {{created by}} a group of black scholars, <b>Ebonics</b> may be defined as [...] "the {{linguistic}} and paralinguistic features which on a concentric continuum represent the communicative competence of the West African, Caribbean, and United States slave descendants of African origin. It includes the various idioms, patois, argots, idiolects, and social dialects of black people" [...] especially those who have adapted to colonial circumstances. <b>Ebonics</b> derives its form from ebony (black) and phonics (sound, the study of sound) and refers {{to the study of the}} language of black people in all its cultural uniqueness.|$|R

5000|$|Further, these {{suggestions}} ask Black families {{and students to}} adapt in order to fit a Eurocentric system. Some researchers have begun to push back, and challenge schools to be more inclusive of activities and classroom setups that promote and support Blackness and Black Identities,. [...] In Fordham's research [...] "Dissin' [...] "the Standard": <b>Ebonics</b> as Guerrilla Warfare at Capital High", Fordham discusses how Black students have taken on <b>Ebonics</b> as the Standard language, and treat Standard English as a vernacular dialect. Fordham implicates that using <b>Ebonics</b> or standard English is a choice. She asserts that many students don't speak [...] "standard english" [...] because, either consciously or unconsciously, they recognize that forcing standard English is an institutionalized convention that [...] "marginalizes and stigmatizes the Black self." [...] Therefore, policies based off the common assumption that Black students can't speak [...] "standard english" [...] will never work, because they force students to perpetuate the dehumanization that occurs by devaluing Black language. [...] Similarly, policies that focus on getting Black students to perform more behaviors associated with Whiteness will be unsuccessful {{to the extent they}} ask Black students and Black families to adopt the behaviors {{of the people who have}} historically oppressed them.|$|R

5000|$|In 1996 with Quan as president, {{the school}} board instituted a program using Standard English Program {{strategies}} to teach standard English to African American students.
