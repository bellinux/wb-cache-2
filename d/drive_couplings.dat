40|$|Material {{models for}} the finite element {{analysis}} (FEA) of polymeric and elastomeric compounds are only available in limited form in most commercial finite element (FE) packages. The most common are the phenomenological Mooney-Rivlin and the Ogden models, for which the constants bear no relationship to the physical or chemical characteristics of the rubber and their derivation is difficult. Both models are limited in their accuracy for filled rubbers used in combined states of tensile and compressive deformation, and since these are common operational conditions for engineering components such as <b>drive</b> <b>couplings,</b> engine mounts and torsional vibration dampers, their use in engineering analyses is restricted. In this paper a statistical mechanics material modelling approach for synthetic, filled elastomeric compounds in FEA is presented. Using styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) as an example, the theory and its application in the commercially available ABAQUS {{finite element analysis program}} is explained. FE models of tensile and compressive specimens in two and three dimensions are used to demonstrate the use of the model, and results are presented, discussed and compared with measured data. Good correlation in both tension and compression is demonstrated. A practical application of the model to the SBR blocks in a Holset torsional drive coupling is presented; this analysis involves complex issues of mesh design and contact modelling. The results show good agreement with measured performance, and clearly demonstrate how this type of material modelling approach can be effectively used in the computer aided engineering and design of engineering rubber components...|$|E

Such driving provides a flexible handle to control various properties {{of the system and}} to obtain new types of effective (static) Hamiltonians with arbitrary static on-site potential, be it deterministic or random. This allows us to obtain reconfigurable changes in transport, from ballistic to localized (including sub- and super-diffusion), depending on the driving protocol. The versatile reconfigurability extends also to scattering from (locally) driven extended targets.

In its simplest form, the mechanism relies on the low bandwidth of control pulses of long duration. Here we perform a higher-order quantum-mechanical treatment that allows for higher precision and shorter times. In particular, we identify three kinds of off-resonant effects: i) simultaneous unwanted <b>driven</b> <b>couplings</b> (e. g. due to drive crosstalk), ii) additional (initially undriven) transitions such as those in an infinite ladder system, and iii) sideband frequencies of the driving waveform such as we find in corrections to the rotating wave approximation. With a framework that is applicable to all three cases, in addition to the known adiabatic error responsible for a shift of the energy levels we typically see in the spectroscopy of such systems, we derive error terms in a controlled expansion corresponding to higher order adiabatic effects and diabatic excitations. We show, by also expanding the driving waveform in a basis of different order derivatives of a trial function (typically a Gaussian) these different error terms can be corrected for in a systematic way hence strongly improving quantum control of systems with dense spectra.

Moreover these dynamic loads can affect the quality and physical properties of the strip. This thesis contains the simulation of different vibration modes in a hot Roughing mill which consists of a Horizontal mill with an attached Edger (Fig. 5. 1).

There are many published works on torsional and vertical vibration of rolling mills especially for cold rolling. In their simulations, the vibrations were calculated with the excitation of a step or ramp-step function, {{but they did not}} consider the oscillation of rolling force and torques caused by the rolls having different velocities due to torsional vibration under asymmetrical rolling conditions.

However, individual qubit coherence times are not far past the scalability threshold for quantum error correction, meaning that millions of physical devices would be required to construct a useful quantum computer. Consequently, further increases in coherence time are very desirable. In this letter, we blueprint a simple circuit consisting of two transmon qubits and two additional lossy qubits or resonators, which is passively protected against all single qubit quantum error channels through a combination of continuous driving and engineered dissipation. Photon losses are rapidly corrected through two-photon drive fields implemented with <b>driven</b> SQUID <b>couplings,</b> and dephasing from random potential fluctuations is heavily suppressed by the drive fields used to implement the multi-qubit Hamiltonian.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{a new class of}} theories which dynamically break supersymmetry based on the gauge group SU(n) ×SU(3) ×U(1) for even n. These theories are interesting in that no dynamical superpotential is generated in the absence of perturbations. For the example SU(4) ×SU(3) ×U(1) we explicitly demonstrate that all flat directions can be lifted through a renormalizable superpotential and that supersymmetry is dynamically broken. We derive the exact superpotential for this theory, which exhibits new and interesting dynamical phenomena. For example, modifications to classical constraints can be field dependent. We also consider the generalization to SU(n) ×SU(3) ×U(1) models (with even n> 4). We present a renormalizable superpotential which lifts all flat directions. Because SU(3) is not confining in the absence of perturbations, the analysis of supersymmetry breaking is very different in these theories from the n = 4 example.

50|$|When {{a driver}} like an {{electric}} motor or a turbine is coupled to a pump, generator, or any other piece of equipment, {{it is essential that}} the shafts of the two pieces are aligned. Any misalignment between the two increases the stress on the shafts and will almost certainly result in excessive wear and premature breakdown of the equipment. This can be very costly. When the equipment is down, production might be down. Also bearings or mechanical seals may be damaged and need to be replaced. Flexible couplings are designed to allow a driver (electric motor, engine, turbine, hydraulic motor) to be connected to the <b>driven</b> equipment. Flexible <b>couplings</b> use an elastomeric insert to allow a slight degree of misalignment. Flexible couplings can also use shim packs. These couplings are called disc couplings.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate under what circumstances Förster theory of electronic (resonance) energy transfer breaks down in molecular aggregates. This is achieved by simulating the dynamics of exciton diffusion, on the femtosecond timescale, in molecular aggregates using the Liouville–von Neumann equation of motion. Specifically the focus of this work is the investigation of both spatial and temporal deviations between exciton dynamics <b>driven</b> by electronic <b>couplings</b> calculated from Förster theory and those calculated from quantum electrodynamics. The quantum electrodynamics (QED) derived couplings contain medium- and far-zone terms that do not exist in Förster theory. The results of the simulations indicate that Förster coupling is valid when the dipole centres are within a few nanometres of one another. However, as the distance between the dipole centres increases from 2 nm to 10 nm, the intermediate- and far-zone coupling terms play non-negligible roles and Förster theory begins to break down. Interestingly, the simulations illustrate how contributions to the exciton dynamics from the intermediate- and far-zone coupling terms of QED are quickly washed-out by the near-zone mechanism of Förster theory for lattices comprising closely packed molecules. On the other hand, in the case of sparsely packed arrays, the exciton dynamics resulting from the different theories diverge within the 100 fs lifetime of the trajectories. These results could have implications for the application of spectroscopic ruler techniques as well as design principles relating to energy harvesting materials...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{properties}} of fermion correlators in a boundary theory dual to the Reissner-Nordström AdS_d+ 1 background {{in the presence of}} a bulk dipole (Pauli) interaction term with strength p. We show that by simply changing the value of the parameter p we can tune continuously from a Fermi liquid (small p), to a marginal Fermi liquid behavior at a critical value of p, to a generic non-Fermi liquid at intermediate values of p, and finally to a Mott insulator at large values of the bulk Pauli coupling. As all of these phases are seen in the cuprate phase diagram, the holographic model we study has the key elements of the strong coupling physics typified by Mott systems. In addition, we extend our analysis to finite temperature and show that the Mott gap closes. Of particular interest is that it closes when the ratio of the gap to the critical temperature is of the order of ten. This behavior is very much similar to that observed in the classic Mott insulator VO_ 2. We then analyze the non-analyticities of the boundary theory fermion correlators for generic values of frequency and momentum by calculating the quasi-normal modes of the bulk fermions. Not surprisingly, we find no evidence for the dipole interaction inducing an instability in the boundary theory. Finally, we briefly consider the introduction of superconducting condensates, and find that in that case, the fermion gap is <b>driven</b> by scalar-fermion <b>couplings</b> rather than by the Pauli coupling.

40|$|Freely-propagating, {{premixed}} gas flames in high-Lewis (Le) number, quiescent mixtures are studied experimentally in tubes of various diameter at normal (lg) and microgravity (mu g). A premixture of lean butane and oxygen diluted with helium, argon, neon, nitrogen or {{a mixture of}} multiple diluents is examined such that the thermal diffusivity of the mixture (and to a lesser extent, the mass diffusivity of the rate-limiting component) is systematically varied. In effect, different diluents allow variation of the Le without changing the chemistry. The flames are recorded with high speed cinematography and their stability is visually assessed. Different modes of propagation were observed depending on {{the diameter of the}} tubes (different conductive heat loss), the composition of the mixture and the g-level. At 1 g, four modes of propagation were observed in small and intermediate diameter tubes (large conductive heat loss) : (1) steadily propagating flames, (2) radial and longitudinal pulsating flames, (3) 'wavering' flames, and (4) rotating spiral flames. As the diameter of the tube increases, the radial modes become more pronounced while the longitudinal modes systematically disappear. Also, multiple, simultaneous, spatially-separated 'pacemaker' sites are observed in intermediate and large diameter tubes. Each site starts as a small region of high luminosity and develops into a flamelet which assumes the form of one of the fore mentioned modes. These flamelets eventually interact, annihilate each other in their regions of intersection and merge at their newly created free-ends. For very large tubes, radially-propagating wave-trains (believed to be 'trigger waves') are observed. These are analogous to the radial pulsations observed in the smaller diameter tubes. At mu g, three modes of propagation have been observed: (1) steadily propagating flames, (2) radial and longitudinal pulsating flames, and (3) multi-armed, rotating flames. Since the pulsating mode exists at mu g and 1 g, buoyant flicker is not the mechanism which drives the pulsations. Moreover, all of the instabilities at 1 g and mu g have characteristic frequencies on the O(100 Hz). This value is lower than the fundamental, longitudinal acoustic frequencies of the tubes which suggests that the instabilities are not acoustically driven. The patterns formed by this reaction bear remarkable similarities with the patterns formed in most excitable media when the behavior of the system is <b>driven</b> by <b>couplings</b> between chemical reaction and diffusion (e. g., Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, Patterns in slime molds, spiral waves in the retina of a bird's eye).

However, most photo-initiated phenomena occurring in nature are <b>driven</b> by the <b>couplings</b> between different electronic states in both isolated molecules and molecular aggregates, and therefore occur beyond the Born-Oppenheimer formalism. These couplings are relevant in reactions relating to the perception of vision in the human eye, the oxidative damage and repair of DNA, the harvesting of light in photosynthesis, and the transfer of charge across large chains of molecules. While these reaction dynamics have traditionally been studied with visible and ultraviolet spectroscopy, attosecond XUV pulses formed {{through the process of}} high harmonic generation form a perfect tool for probing coupled electronic dynamics in molecules. In this thesis, I will present our work in using ultrafast, XUV spectroscopy to study these dynamics in molecules of increasing complexity. We begin by probing the relaxation dynamics of superexcited states in diatomic O₂. These states can relax via two types of electronic couplings, either through autoionization or neutral dissociation. We find that our pump-probe scheme can disentangle the two relaxation mechanisms and independently measure their contributing lifetimes. Next, we present our work in observing a coherent electron hole wavepacket initiated by the ionization of polyatomic CO₂ near a conical intersection. The electron-nuclear couplings near the conical intersection drive the electron hole between different orbital configurations. We find that we can not only measure the lifetime of quantum coherence in the electron hole wavepacket, but also control its evolution with a strong, infrared probing field. Finally, we propose an experiment to observe the migration of an electron hole across iodobenzene on the few-femtosecond timescale. We present experimental modifications made to the high harmonic generation set-up in order to probe this ultrafast and elusive charge migration. These results demonstrate the potential of ultrafast, XUV spectroscopy in probing the inner-workings of electronic couplings occurring in nature...|$|R
