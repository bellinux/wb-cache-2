50|$|During apartheid, local {{government}} was split between different {{racial and cultural}} groups. The result was a very scattered governmental landscape at the local level. To induce the integration of these entities, the transitional representative councils were established. Therefore, the transitional representative councils were a composition of representatives of all existing {{local government}} bodies, including former black local authorities, former (white) local councils, boards of rural areas, committees for local affairs, regional service councils, joint service boards, joint-decision making bodies, joint local authorities, other official local authorities and persons, <b>institutions</b> <b>or</b> <b>bodies</b> with local government powers i.e. private towns and mining towns.|$|R

The EDPS then analyses this processing in relation to the Data Protection Regulation and issues a [...] "prior check" [...] opinion.

50|$|Management of bore wells is very poor. The bore wells are {{practically}} {{owned by the}} operators, who fix the price of water for livestock and human consumption. Different water prices are charged by the operators on the different bore wells in coastal areas. The operators are not accountable to any government <b>institution</b> <b>or</b> <b>body,</b> including the beneficiaries of bore wells.Unlike the strategic bore wells in the coastal zone, mini- water systems exist in the major towns and villages in Mountainous Zone. The main sources of mini water systems are hand dug shallow wells connected to pumps run by diesel pumps or by solar installations.Mini water systems are for human consumption and funded by international organizations with collaboration of local communities and local governments. They are managed by committee and charge affordable rate to beneficiaries. Some of the proceeds are paid to operators for salaries and the remainder is used for spare parts and for repairs and maintenance services.|$|E
5000|$|On October 19, 2010, the French MEP, Michele Striffler, tabled a {{question}} in the European Parliament on Brazil's refusal to abide by its international treaties in this regard:The Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, of 25 October 1980, known as the Hague Convention, seeks to guarantee the immediate return of children unlawfully removed or retained by one of their parents in a contracting State. It also seeks {{to ensure that the}} custody, visitation and accommodation rights of children in contracting States are respected.Under Article 3, the removal abroad of a child by a parent is considered unlawful when it takes place in violation of the custody rights granted to the other parent, or to any <b>institution</b> <b>or</b> <b>body,</b> under the laws of the State in which the child normally resided before being removed.Furthermore, the Hague Convention lays down a simple and swift procedure for resolving the removal of minors outside their country of usual residence, without exhaustive examination of the dispute between the parents. Rulings on the custody of such children can only be issued by a judge in the child's usual place of residenceMoreover, a best practice guide has been drawn up by the Hague Permanent Office (responsible for monitoring implementation of the convention), to avoid disparities in the scope and level of services offered by the various central authorities entrusted with the task of enforcing the convention.Nevertheless, the legal systems in numerous States which have signed the Hague Convention (in particular the Brazilian legal authorities) continue to consider these cases as child custody disputes, in flagrant contravention of the letter and spirit of the convention, thereby significantly delaying the implementation of its provisions and the resolution of disputes.It should be borne in mind that these displaced children are the main victims in such situations. Their prolonged removal has serious psychological repercussions which may dramatically affect their future lives.There are many unresolved cases involving European children who have been taken to third countries which are signatories to the convention (particularly Brazil) and whose return is being obstructed by poor application of the Convention.What measures does the Council intend to take to ensure that third countries, in particular Brazil, comply with the Convention, with a view to putting an end to these unacceptable situations and securing the swift return of abducted children? ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} anemia and analyze the factors associated with anemia in elderly residents of long-term care institutions. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed in male and female elderly volunteers selected in a two-stage random sampling from long-term care institutions {{in the city of}} Maringa, Brazil (2008). A diagnosis of anemia was based on the plasma hemoglobin concentration. The independent variables analyzed were gender, age, time of residence at an institution, body mass index, and serum iron and albumin concentrations. The association between anemia and the variables was assessed using the Poisson regression with robust variance in unadjusted and adjusted analyses, considering a complex sample and a significance level of 5 %. Results: The sample included 124 adults older than 60 y residing in long-term care institutions (53. 0 % female). The prevalence of anemia was 29 % and was not significantly associated with gender, serum iron concentration, time of residence at an <b>institution,</b> <b>or</b> <b>body</b> mass index. Conversely, hypoalbuminemia was considered a risk factor for anemia. Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of anemia in the institutionalized elderly and hypoalbuminemia is a factor associated with this outcome. Interventions are necessary to promote improvements in the health and welfare of this population. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc...|$|E
40|$|In 1995, the European Parliament {{established}} {{the post of}} European Ombudsman by article 195 of the Maastricht Treaty. Its remit was to protect the citizens and any legal entity of the Union {{from the consequences of}} maladministration andmalfunctioning of the Community institutions or bodies. Any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in aMember State can complain to the Ombudsman, who then investigates the case. To be valid, a complaint must be made within two years of the date when the plaintiff took cognizance of the facts on which the complaint is based; it must concern a Community institution or body; and an appropriate administrative procedure against the <b>institution</b> <b>or</b> <b>body</b> concerned must have been initiated prior to the complaint being made. The Ombudsman. s experience to date indicates that a vast proportion of complaints referred to him fail to meet the requirements necessary to his intervention. In most cases that are investigated, complainants achieve satisfaction. It is often the case that the Ombudsman. s initiative prompts an overhauling of the existing regulations pertaining to Citizens Rights and their upholding by the Community institutions and bodies. It is thus legitimate to consider the European Ombudsman to be an important institutional step towards a further strengthening of Citizens Rights in the policies of the European Union, post-Maastricht Treaty and post-Amsterdam Conference. The Ombudsman would gain additional support were the Charter of Fundamental Rights incorporated into the future European Constitution. ...|$|E
