40|$|We {{evaluated}} two commercial F 1 antigen capture-based immunochromatographic <b>dipsticks,</b> Yersinia Pestis (F 1) Smart II and Plague BioThreat Alert test strips, {{in detecting}} plague bacilli by using whole-blood samples from mice experimentally infected with Yersinia pestis CO 92. To assess the specificities of these <b>dipsticks,</b> an in-frame F 1 -deficient mutant of CO 92 (Δcaf) was generated by homologous recombination {{and used as}} a negative control. Based on genetic, antigenic/immunologic, and electron microscopic analyses, the Δcaf mutant was devoid of a capsule.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} contributors to Fiero engines catching fire. The primary cause {{is thought to}} be a batch of poorly cast connecting rods, produced in GM's Saginaw plant, which failed when the oil level became too low. One theory is that the sports car styling attracted buyers who would drive the car hard, most notably by excessively revving the engine. Another factor was the incorrectly listed three-quart oil capacity; the actual oil capacity is 4.5quarts, but a misprint on the <b>dipstick</b> and in the owner's manual resulted in owners using only three quarts, any leakage or consumption would allow the oil level to decline over time to a dangerously low level. If the proper oil level was not maintained, the bearings could seize, snapping the porous castings of the connecting rods. This could result in a hole being punched in the engine block, allowing oil to spray onto hot exhaust components where it could ignite.|$|E
25|$|Screening {{those who}} have neither {{symptoms}} nor risk factors for CKD is not recommended. Those who should be screened include: those with hypertension or history of cardiovascular disease, those with diabetes or marked obesity, those aged > 60 years, subjects with indigenous racial origin, those {{with a history of}} kidney disease in the past and subjects who have relatives who had kidney disease requiring dialysis. Screening should include calculation of estimated GFR from the serum creatinine level, and measurement of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a first-morning urine specimen (this reflects the amount of a protein called albumin in the urine), as well as a urine <b>dipstick</b> screen for hematuria. The GFR (glomerular filtration rate) is derived from the serum creatinine and is proportional to 1/creatinine, i.e. it is a reciprocal relationship (the higher the creatinine, the lower the GFR). It reflects one aspect of kidney function: how efficiently the glomeruli (filtering units) work. But as they make up <5% of the mass of the kidney, the GFR does not indicate all aspects of kidney health and function. This can be done by combining the GFR level with the clinical assessment of the patient (especially fluid state) and measuring the levels of hemoglobin, potassium, phosphate and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Normal GFR is 90-120 mLs/min. The units of creatinine vary from country to country.|$|E

500|$|Mutinus elegans, {{commonly}} known as the elegant stinkhorn, the dog stinkhorn, the headless stinkhorn, or the devil's <b>dipstick,</b> is a species of fungus in the Phallaceae family. A saprobic species, it is typically found growing on the ground singly or in small groups on woody debris or leaf litter, during summer and autumn in Japan, Europe, and eastern North America. The fruit body begins its development in an [...] "egg" [...] form, resembling somewhat a puffball partially submerged in the ground. As the fungus matures, a slender orange to pink colored stalk emerges that tapers evenly to a pointed tip. The stalk is covered with a foul-smelling slimy green spore mass on the upper third of its length. Flies and other insects feed upon the slime which contains the spores, assisting in their dispersal. Due to their repellent odor, mature specimens are not generally considered edible, although there are reports of the immature [...] "eggs" [...] being consumed. In the laboratory, Mutinus elegans has been shown to inhibit the growth of several microorganisms that can be pathogenic to humans.|$|E

Testing of the LC model indicated non-invariance {{of the performance of}} the diagnostic tests across different age groups, and measurement invariance held for males and females and for the three villages.

40|$|Abstract Aim: A {{clinical}} audit on {{urinary tract infection}} (UTI) management to identify deviations from published local guidelines and any areas of improvement. Method: Retrospective review of 2 cohorts of children below 2 years old admitted to paediatric wards of a regional hospital. Data were extracted according to structured questionnaires. The first cohort included children admitted for fever without foci of infection, and data were collected to evaluate the adequacy of screening for UTI. The second cohort included children with a diagnostic label of UTI. The diagnostic criteria, treatment and follow-up imaging tests were evaluated. Results: Part I: 97 children were recruited. UTI was screened in 87. 6 % (23. 7 % by both <b>dipsticks</b> and bedside microscopy and 63. 9 % by <b>dipsticks</b> only). After an initial positive screening by <b>dipsticks</b> and/or bedside microscopy, only 44. 4 % had appropriately definitive tests by culture of a proper urine specimen (bladder tap/catheter/clean catch urine) whereas half of the cases had repeated bag urine screening. For patients who needed antibiotics immediately due to ill conditions on admission, proper urine was collected for culture in only 60 %. Part II: 76 patients were recruited. UTI diagnosis was based on positive culture from a proper urine specimen in 92. 1 %, but of the 5 cases managed by doctors in Accident & Emergency Department or private practice, 4 (80 %) were based on bag urine culture.

2500|$|The Italian word [...] "stiletto" [...] {{comes from}} the Latin stilus, the thin pointed Roman writing {{instrument}} used to engrave wax or clay tablets in ancient times. [...] The stiletto began to gain fame during the late Middle Ages, when it was the secondary weapon of knights.

2500|$|The histidine-rich protein II (HRP II) is a histidine- and alanine-rich, {{water-soluble}} protein, {{which is}} localized in several cell compartments including the parasite cytoplasm. The antigen is expressed only by P. falciparum trophozoites. HRP II from P. falciparum has {{been implicated in}} the biocrystallization of hemozoin, an inert, crystalline form of ferriprotoporphyrin IX (Fe(3+)-PPIX) produced by the parasite. [...] A substantial amount of the HRP II is secreted by the parasite into the host bloodstream and the antigen can be detected in erythrocytes, serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and even urine as a secreted water-soluble protein. These antigens persist in the circulating blood after the parasitaemia has cleared or has been greatly reduced. It generally takes around two weeks after successful treatment for HRP2-based tests to turn negative, but may {{take as long as}} one month, which compromises their value in the detection of active infection. False positive <b>dipstick</b> results were reported in patients with rheumatoid-factor-positive rheumatoid arthritis. Since HRP-2 is expressed only by P. falciparum, these tests will give negative results with samples containing only P. vivax, P. ovale, or P. malariae; many cases of non-falciparum malaria may therefore be misdiagnosed as malaria negative (some P.falciparum strains also don’t have HRP II). The variability in the results of pHRP2-based RDTs is related to the variability in the target antigen.|$|E

40|$|SETTING: Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the usefulness of}} urine <b>dipsticks</b> for monitoring adherence to anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. DESIGN: In-house urine <b>dipsticks</b> for detection of isoniazid (INH) metabolites were compared to commercial test strips. The value of n-butanol to detect rifampicin was compared to coloration of the urine. Non-adherence was assessed through a questionnaire and reviews of the Mulago Hospital TB register. RESULTS: Urine was obtained from 236 patients (127 adults and 109 children) on daily chemotherapy. Using commercial test strips as standard, the sensitivity of in-house urine <b>dipsticks</b> was 99. 5 % and specificity was 96. 4 %. The sensitivity and the specificity of n-butanol and of coloration of urine to detect rifampicin were low (64. 0 % and 54. 9 %, and 85. 5 % and 64. 8 %, respectively). Fifty patients (21. 2 %) admitted non-adherence to treatment during the previous month. An additional 15 (6. 8 %) were detected through urine testing. Of 911 patients in the TB register of Mulago Hospital who had started treatment in the first 3 months of 2000, 39. 7 % did not complete their treatment. Two-thirds of these had discontinued treatment in the first 2 months. CONCLUSION: In-house INH test strips are as effective as commercially available strips for detecting isoniazid in the urine.
