40|$|The paper explores how the {{monetary}} and <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> have coordinated {{with each other}} in Pakistan. It argues that monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> have been executed independently throughout the study period that is 1964 - 65 to 2008 - 09 and there have been very few instances of coordination between the two policies while addressing prevailing economic conditions. The paper does not find any difference between the behavior of monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> before and after the establishment of Monetary and <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Policies</b> Coordination Board in 1994.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} how <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> {{should look like}} {{in a country like}} Slovenia. Slovenia’s present situation is characterized by high and rapidly increasing public debt and low growth. It is an interesting case because {{it is one of the}} few small open economies from Central and Eastern Europe that was already in the Euro Area before the “Great Recession”. Using the SLOPOL model, an econometric model of the Slovenian economy, we analyse the effects of different <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> in Slovenia over the next couple of years by means of simulations. In particular, we determine optimal <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> for Slovenia over the next few years. Using the OPTCON algorithm, we calculate approximately optimal <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> under different scenarios. We show that an optimal design of <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> depends essentially on the political preferences of Slovenian policy makers. Moreover, the simulations and optimizations reveal the small scope of possible alternative <b>fiscal</b> stabilization <b>policies</b> available due to the relatively low effectiveness of the fiscal instruments with respect to their influence on the business cycle in the Slovenian economy.

40|$|Currently <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> in Germany {{seem to be}} in a very {{comfortable}} position and the German Debt Brake is regarded as an institutional precondition for this success and has been exported to the Euro area in the guise of the Fiscal Compact. In this paper we scrutinize German <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> and its new national and European institutional constraints from a macroeconomic perspective. We start by reiterating the requirements for <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> of member countries in a currency union like the Euro area from a Post-Keynesian perspective and examine German <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> in the period from 1999 until 2007 against this theoretical background. We then turn to German <b>fiscal</b> <b>policies</b> during the Great Recession, the German Debt Brake, the Fiscal Compact and future perspectives, and analyse the associated problems and risks. Finally, we discuss alternative scenarios which could avoid the deflationary pressures of the German Debt Brake and the Fiscal Compact on domestic demand and contribute to internally rebalancing the Euro area...|$|R
5|$|Keynes's {{prescription}} for strong public investment had ties to {{his interest in}} uncertainty. Keynes had given a unique perspective on statistical inference in A Treatise on Probability, written in 1921, years before his major economic works. Keynes thought strong public investment and <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> would counter the negative impacts the uncertainty of economic fluctuations can have on the economy. While Keynes's successors {{paid little attention to}} the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty may have played a central part in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory.|$|E

Keynes's influence waned in the 1970s, {{partly as a result}} of the stagflation that plagued the Anglo-American economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists.

5|$|Tariffs {{had been}} raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterwards, Garfield, who made a close study of {{financial}} affairs, advocated moving towards free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and Means Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held {{the majority in the}} House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee during that time. Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee, but it was Ways and Means, with its influence over <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> that he really wanted to lead.

5|$|Bohun's {{spent most}} of his early career reconquering Marcher lands {{captured}} by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd during the Welsh war in England. This was finally accomplished through Edward I's war in Wales in 1277. Hereford also fought in Wales in 128283 and 129495. At the same time he also had private feuds with other Marcher lords, and his conflict with Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, eventually ended with the personal intervention of King Edward himself. Hereford's final years were marked by the opposition he and Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, mounted against the military and <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> of Edward I. The conflict escalated to a point where civil war threatened, but was resolved when the war effort turned towards Scotland. The king signed the Confirmatio Cartaruma confirmation of Magna Cartaand Bohun and Bigod agreed to serve on the Falkirk Campaign. Bohun died in 1298, and was succeeded by his son, Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford.|$|E

5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E
5|$|Ford often opposed {{governor}} Mark Sanford's political goals, arguing {{his proposed}} reforms were unwanted by the public, and he mostly opposed Sanford's <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy</b> and worked to override budget vetoes by the governor, claiming he {{was removed from}} the interests of citizens. An exception were security measures for the State House complex which Ford agreed were too costly.

The reform would have required all employers to use state driver's licenses or a database from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to check the legal status of workers. Ford co-sponsored a bill with Glenn McConnell that would limit the governor's authority to appoint and remove board members overseeing the Charleston port and increase required qualifications for board members.

5|$|Juárez Celman's {{administration}} saw {{a substantial}} increase in the ratio of debt to GDP {{toward the end of his}} tenure and an increasing weakness in the fiscal situation. The Baring Brothers merchant bank had developed a close and profitable association with Argentina, and when Celman's government was unable to meet its payments to the House of Baring, a financial crisis ensued. Argentina defaulted and suffered bank runs as the Baring Brothers faced failure. The crisis was caused by the lack of co-ordination between monetary policy and <b>fiscal</b> <b>policy,</b> which ultimately led to the collapse of the banking system. The financial crisis of 1890 left the government with no funds for its immigration subsidies programme, and it was abolished in 1891. Loans to Argentina were severely curtailed, and imports had to be cut sharply. Exports were less affected, but the value of Argentine exports did not surpass the 1889 peak until 1898.|$|E
