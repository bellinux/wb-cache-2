In 1990–91, a small animal model of poliomyelitis was developed by two laboratories. Mice were engineered to express a human receptor to poliovirus (hPVR).|$|E
5|$|Birds <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> {{celebrated in}} the arts of Japan, {{including}} in painting, woodblock printing, cloisonné, ceramics and indeed poetry from the 18th and 19th centuries. Print artists like Utamaro and Hokusai made use of Western and Chinese influences to give a sophisticated effect, while Hiroshige reworked the traditional bird-and-flower genre.|$|E

5|$|Paints {{containing}} {{zinc oxide}} powder <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> utilized as anticorrosive coatings for metals. They are especially effective for galvanized iron. Iron {{is difficult to}} protect because its reactivity with organic coatings leads to brittleness and lack of adhesion. Zinc oxide paints retain their flexibility and adherence on such surfaces for many years.|$|E

5|$|The {{actions of}} Định {{in the wake}} of the Treaty of Saigon <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> a subject of conjecture. At the time, the French {{military}} accused Huế of surreptitiously supporting Định in contravention of the treaty, while Huế denied this, publicly claiming that Định's actions in resisting the French would be counterproductive in attempting to maintain Vietnamese sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|The {{cane toad}} {{is an old}} species. A fossil toad (specimen UCMP 41159) from the La Venta fauna of the late Miocene of Colombia is indistinguishable from modern cane toads from {{northern}} South America.

5|$|The federal {{government}} and the states <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> permitted to limit obscenity or pornography.

5|$|Though {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} ungainly and awkward when on the ground, {{the anatomy of}} some pterosaurs (particularly pterodactyloids) suggests that they were competent walkers and runners. Early pterosaurs <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> considered particularly cumbersome locomotors due {{to the presence of}} large cruropatagia, but they too appear to have been generally efficient on the ground.|$|E
5|$|While {{iron and}} steel <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> the main {{industries}} of Sheffield, coal mining {{has also been a}} major industry, particularly in the outlying areas, and the Palace of Westminster in London was built using limestone from quarries in the nearby village of Anston.

5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schubert's last sonatas <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> historically neglected, {{dismissed as}} inferior in style to Beethoven's piano sonatas. However, the negative view has changed {{during the late}} twentieth century, and today these works are usually praised for their conveying of an idiosyncratic, personal Schubertian style, indeed quite different from Beethoven's, but holding its own virtues. In this mature style, the Classical perception of harmony and tonality, and the treatment of musical structure, are radically altered, generating a new, distinct type of sonata form.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated by humans both as pets and for {{practical}} purposes. Colourful birds, such as parrots and mynas, are bred in captivity or kept as pets, {{a practice that}} has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species. Falcons and cormorants <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> used for hunting and fishing, respectively. Messenger pigeons, used since at least 1 AD, remained important as recently as World War II. Today, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism, or for sports such as pigeon racing.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{attention}} created by the Beatles' song, the street signs for Blue Jay Way <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> collector's items for fans visiting the Hollywood Hills. In May 2015, a lane in the Heavitree area of Exeter, in the English county of Devon, was named Blue Jay Way after the song. In addition {{to much of the}} filming for Magical Mystery Tour having taken place at various locations in the West Country, the title commemorates the Beatles' three concert appearances at Exeter's ABC Cinema over 1963–64.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{economic}} uses, birds have been hunted for food since Palaeolithic times. They have been captured and bred as poultry to provide meat and eggs {{since at least the}} time of Ancient Egypt. Some species have been used, too, to help locate or to catch food, as with cormorant fishing and the use of honeyguides. Feathers <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> used for bedding, as well as for quill pens and for fletching arrows.|$|E
5|$|Jellyfish stings killed about 1,500 {{people in}} the 20th century, and cubozoans are {{particularly}} dangerous. On the other hand, some large jellyfish are considered a delicacy in East and Southeast Asia. Coral reefs <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> economically important as providers of fishing grounds, protectors of shore buildings against currents and tides, and more recently as centers of tourism. However, they are vulnerable to over-fishing, mining for construction materials, pollution, and damage caused by tourism.|$|E
5|$|Mount Bailey {{is part of}} the High Cascades in {{the western}} United States. The High Cascades <b>have</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> glaciated, by both Pacific-bred storms and natural, elevation-caused, {{glaciation}}. In fact, glaciation probably formed on them as early as the late Miocene. Over time, as the range built up, newer activity diminished older Tertiary age rock. Creating lava plateaus, Pliocene activity, mostly basaltic and andesitic, was probably responsible for the original cones at Bailey, Thielsen, and Union Peak.|$|E
