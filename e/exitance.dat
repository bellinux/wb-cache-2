40|$|The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) {{involves}} the use of a system of three spacecraft with instrument packages for measuring the earth's radiation balance to an accuracy which has been unattainable in previous experiments. The experiment is to determine the monthly averaged radiant <b>exitances</b> at te 'top of the atmosphere' (TOA) over the earth with a resolution of 250 km. The realization of this goal requires the conduction of high accuracy measurements, and the computation of the instantaneous radiant <b>exitances</b> from these measurements. The operation involved in this computation is called an 'inversion'. A third requirement is related to the computation of the daily and monthly averaged regional values from the instantaneous values. A brief description is provided of the algorithms for the inversion of the measurements to TOA radiant <b>exitances,</b> taking into account also the techniques which are used to validate the methods and results...|$|R
40|$|Two {{instrument}} modules of each satellite {{on which}} the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is orbiting observe components of the earth radiation budget with three different scales of earth view. An intercomparison of longwave measurements by these instruments provides relative information concerning radiometric performance at satellite altitude, techniques of estimating upwelling <b>exitances,</b> and an end-to-end evaluation of the data processing system. Results indicate that the ERBE radiometers are mildly sensitive to varying thermal loads from the spacecraft and/or the earth-space environment. Radiometric variations at the satellite and methods of data interpretation contribute about equally to the uncertainty of radiant <b>exitances</b> from the earth...|$|R

2500|$|Absorbance is {{a number}} that {{measures}} the attenuation of the transmitted radiant power in a material. Attenuation {{can be caused by}} the physical process of [...] "absorption", but also reflection, scattering, and other physical processes. Absorbance of a material is approximately equal to its attenuance when both the absorbance is much less than 1 and the emittance of that material (not to be confused with radiant <b>exitance</b> or emissivity) is much less than the absorbance. Indeed, ...|$|E
5000|$|In radiometry, radiant <b>exitance</b> or radiant {{emittance}} is the radiant flux emitted by a surface per unit area, whereas spectral <b>exitance</b> or spectral emittance is the radiant <b>exitance</b> of a surface per unit frequency or wavelength, {{depending on whether}} the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. This is the emitted component of radiosity. The SI unit of radiant <b>exitance</b> is the watt per square metre (...) , while that of spectral <b>exitance</b> in frequency is the watt per square metre per hertz (W·m−2·Hz−1) and that of spectral <b>exitance</b> in wavelength is the watt per square metre per metre (W·m−3)—commonly the watt per square metre per nanometre (...) [...] The CGS unit erg per square centimeter per second (...) is often used in astronomy. Radiant <b>exitance</b> is often called [...] "intensity" [...] in branches of physics other than radiometry, but in radiometry this usage leads to confusion with radiant intensity.|$|E

40|$|The {{computation}} of Earth {{radiation budget}} from satellite measurements requires {{the identification of}} the scene in order to select spectral factors and bidirectional models. A scene identification procedure is developed for AVHRR SW and LW data by using two radiative transfer models. These AVHRR GAC pixels are then attached to corresponding ERBE pixels and the results are sorted into scene identification probability matrices. These scene intercomparisons show that there generally is a higher tendency for underestimation of cloudiness over ocean at high cloud amounts, e. g., mostly cloudy instead of overcast, partly cloudy instead of mostly cloudy, for the ERBE relative to the AVHRR results. Reasons for this are explained. Preliminary estimates of the errors of <b>exitances</b> due to scene misidentification demonstrates the high dependency on the probability matrices. While the longwave error can generally be neglected the shortwave deviations have reached maximum values of more than 12 % of the respective <b>exitances...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of the earth's radiation budget has been chosen to illustrate the technique of objective system design. The measurement process is an approximately linear transformation of the original field of radiant <b>exitances,</b> so that linear statistical techniques may be employed. The combination of variability, measurement strategy, and error propagation is presently made {{with the help of}} information theory, as suggested by Kondratyev et al. (1975) and Peckham (1974). Covariance matrices furnish the quantitative statement of field variability...|$|R

The subsatellite surface type is classified to adjust for albedo changes and correction values are added for the types of cloud cover detected...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} {{satellite}} missions and their {{measurements of the}} earth radiation budget {{from the beginning of}} the space age until the present time are reviewed. The survey emphasizes the early struggle to develop instrument systems to monitor reflected shortwave and emitted long-wave <b>exitances</b> from the earth, and the problems associated with the interpretation of these observations from space. In some instances, valuable data sets were developed from satellite measurements whose instruments were not specifically designed for earth radiation budget observations...|$|R
40|$|The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment {{carries a}} three-channel {{scanning}} radiometer {{and a set}} of nadir-looking wide and medium field-of-view instruments for measuring the radiation emitted from earth and the solar radiation reflected from earth. This paper describes the algorithms which are used to compute the radiant <b>exitances</b> at a reference level ('top of the atmosphere') from these measurements. Methods used to analyze data from previous radiation budget experiments are reviewed, and the rationale for the present algorithms is developed. The scanner data are converted to radiances by use of spectral factors, which account for imperfect spectral response of the optics. These radiances are converted to radiant <b>exitances</b> at the reference level by use of directional models, which account for anisotropy of the radiation as it leaves the earth. The spectral factors and directional models are {{selected on the basis of}} the scene, which is identified on the basis of the location and the long-wave and shortwave radiances. These individual results are averaged over 2. 5 x 2. 5 deg regions. Data from the wide and medium field-of-view instruments are analyzed by use of the traditional shape factor method and also by use of a numerical filter, which permits resolution enhancement along the orbit track...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} filter {{inversion technique}} that reduces wide-angle satellite measurements to top-of-the-atmosphere radiant <b>exitances</b> {{has been proposed}} for the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE). The matrix formulation of this technique is presented, and {{the design of the}} numerical filter is discussed. The filter is smoothed with a singular value decomposition. The inversion process is simulated by generating synthetic measurements from a 24 degree spherical harmonic radiation field derived from Nimbus 6 ERB data. The numerical filter is applied to these measurements after they are corrupted with instrument error. The results are curves of expected error versus resolution area...|$|R

40|$|The Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) is a multisatellite {{experiment}} {{which is}} to be implemented in the mid 1980 s. The experiment involves a utilization of instruments on one or more sun-synchronous satellites in the NOAA series, and the employment of a dedicated spacecraft, the ERBS, in a 57 deg orbit. One of the objectives of ERBE is related to an improvement of knowledge regarding the diurnal variability in the earth's radiation balance. In the present investigation, satellite samples of longwave (LW) radiation over land are simulated for both sun-synchronous and non-sun-synchronous orbits. Three different LW diurnal models are then applied to the sampled data, and the resulting modeled monthly net LW radiant <b>exitances</b> are compared against reference values based on complete hourly sampling of the area for a month. The results demonstrate the general usefulness of a trigonometric diurnal LW model for land regions with daytime heating trends...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of cotton leaves is described using gyroscopic coordinates. Angular movements represented as pitching, rolling, and yawing {{are used to}} follow the movement of leaf normals and their instantaneous relationships to the sun on an individual basis. A sensitivity analysis establishes that the angle between a leaf normal {{and the sun is}} most affected by changes in pitch and roll. Plots of the phase angle gamma averaged by quadrant show the pronounced heliotropic {{behavior of}} cotton leaves. Plots of pitch versus roll averaged by quadrant demonstrate the differential behavior of cotton leaves relative to the position of the sun. These results are used to interpret sections taken from bidirectional reflectance curves obtained using 0. 57 - 0. 69 micron band in terms of the evolution of gamma from sunrise until noon. The measured and experimental values of gamma are in reasonable agreement. Forescattered and backscattered <b>exitances</b> are observed to have distinct leaf normal directions...|$|R
