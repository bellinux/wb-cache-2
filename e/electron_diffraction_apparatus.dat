Above ∼ 350 K, reconstruction of the Pt overlayer interferes with the oscillations.

The {{ultimate goal of}} our project {{is to build a}} coherent <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>apparatus</b> for atomic structure determination from oriented single macromolecules. This involves generating protein ions from electrospray ionization (ESI) and doping them in helium droplets. The doped droplets are then oriented by an elliptically polarized laser and exposed to a coherent electron beam for diffraction. The specific goal of my project is to explore the methods for sample preparation. I have started by exploring the doping conditions for continuous cesium ions from a thermionic emission source and then moved on to pulsed ions from an ESI source. I have also characterized the size and size distribution of the doped droplets. The relative ion doping efficiency of the continuous cesium ions is determined by both the kinetic energy of the ions {{and the size of the}} droplets. For reserpine and substance P from the ESI source, we have succeeded with a simple experimental setup by stopping the ions in the droplet beam with a DC bias. The resulting doping efficiency is observed to scale with the residence time of the ion beam in the droplet beam. To further control the size of the ion doped droplets for diffraction, I also have performed an exploratory experiment of collisional size reduction of ion doped droplets.

40|$|The {{construction}} and {{utilization of the}} fourth-generation ultrafast <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>apparatus,</b> UED 4, {{is the subject of}} this thesis. With UED 4 and its novel and universal sample delivery method based on laser desorption, we were able to vaporize thermally labile molecular samples and determine their ground-state structures and the structures of their photochemical and photophysical reaction products. Each component part of the new UED 4 apparatus is described, and the experimental and computational procedures used to extract structural information from the time-resolved diffraction patterns are presented. Several molecules were studied in their ground states and photoinduced excited states or product states on the time scale of picoseconds and nanoseconds. With UED 3, nitrobenzene was shown to undergo intramolecular rearrangement prior to NO loss in an ultrafast fragmentation reaction. In indole, the chromophore of the amino acid tryptophan, the involvement of a dark structure, formed on the picosecond time scale, was revealed in the nonradiative decay pathway of the initially excited state. By determining the ground state structures of the thermally labile nucleobases uracil and guanine, the first use of surface-assisted laser desorption in a pulsed electron diffraction experiment was reported using the newly developed UED 4 apparatus. The determined structures of the photochemically generated species of the photochromic molecule 6 -nitro-BIPS further demonstrated the capability of laser desorption electron diffraction to function as a time-resolved experiment. Finally, the fragmentation reaction of the amino acid tryptophan upon UV laser irradiation was studied with UED 4.

40|$|Crystal {{structure}} determination by electron crystallography {{has been}} very successful in many fields, ranging from organic to inorganic materials. Collection of <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> data is still a crucial step in electron crystallography. The curvature of the Ewald sphere limits the data available in each <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> pattern. The dynamical multi-scattering effect of <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> increases {{the complexity of the}} structure determination procedure. A precession method (Vincent 2 ̆ 6 Midgley, 1994) has been used to solve the crystal structure of AlmFe by Gjonnes and coworker (Berg et al., 1998; Gjonnes et al., 1998).

40|$|<b>Electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> is a {{complementary}} technique to single-crystal X-ray diffraction and powder X-ray diffraction for structure solution of unknown crystals. Crystals {{too small to}} be studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction or too complex to be solved by powder X-ray diffraction can be studied by <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction.</b> The main drawbacks of <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> have been the difficulties in collecting complete three-dimensional <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> data by conventional <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> methods and the very time-consuming data collection. In addition, the intensities of <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> suffer from dynamical scattering. Recently, a new <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> method, rotation <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> (RED), was developed, which can overcome the drawbacks and reduce dynamical effects. A complete three-dimensional <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> data set can be collected from a sub-micrometre-sized single crystal in less than 2 h. Here the RED method is applied for ab initio structure determination of an unknown complex intermetallic phase, the pseudo-decagonal (PD) quasicrystal approximant Al 37. 0 (Co,Ni) 15. 5, denoted as PD 2. RED shows that the crystal is F-centered, with a = 46. 4, b = 64. 6, c = 8. 2 Å. However, as with other approximants in the PD series, the reflections with odd l indices are much weaker than those with l even, so it was decided to first solve the PD 2 structure in the smaller, primitive unit cell. The basic structure of PD 2 with unit-cell parameters a = 23. 2, b = 32. 3, c = 4. 1 Å and space group Pnmm has been solved in the present study.

40|$|Gas-phase {{electron}} diffraction (GED) is {{the method}} of choice for determining the structures of molecules containing between two and 100 atoms, free from intermolecular interaction. However, for many molecules it becomes necessary to augment the experimental GED data with information from other sources. The SARACEN method, used routinely at Edinburgh when determining structures, allows computed parameters from ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) calculations {{to be used as}} extra data in the GED refinement process. This thesis describes the determinations of the gas-phase structures of molecules that contain heavy p-block elements, including examples from Groups 13, 14, 15 and 16. Each of the compounds studied was solid at room temperature, requiring heating to produce a suitable vapour pressure and vaporisation rate and testing the existing <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>apparatus</b> to its limits. Use was made of a new heated reservoir, recently developed in Edinburgh by a previous PhD student, which has allowed compounds to be studied that were previously inaccessible. The molecules that were studied {{during the course of this}} degree are: In(P 3 C 2 But 2), In(P 2 C 3 But 3), Sn(P 2 C 2 But 2), Sb 2 (C 6 F 6) 3, Bi 2 (C 6 F 6) 3, Se(SCH 3) 2 and Te(SCH 3) 2. While determining the structures of these molecules, accurate theoretical geometries have been obtained using both ab initio and DFT methods. As a result a better understanding has been achieved of which methods are suitable for use in calculating the structures of molecules with heavy p-block elements. The use of pseudopotentials as opposed to all-electron basis sets proved necessary when performing calculations on such large molecules with heavy atoms. The extent to which these pseudopotentials, especially ones that consider very few electrons to be in the valence shell of an atom, can affect the calculated geometries has been shown to be considerable. In addition, methods being developed to compute vibrational corrections for gas-phase structure determination have been extended to the crystalline phase. Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to derive the effects of vibrations on average nuclear positions, relative to equilibrium positions. The differences, when applied to coordinates obtained experimentally by neutron diffraction yield experimental equilibrium structures. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Three {{instruments}} for femtosecond electron diffraction (FED) experiments were erected, partially commissioned {{and used for}} first diffraction experiments. The Relativistic Electron Gun for Atomic Exploration (REGAE) was completed by beamline elements including supports, a specimen chamber and dark current or electron beam collimating elements such that the commissioning process, including first diffraction experiments in this context, could be started. The temporal resolution of this machine is simulated to be 25 fs (fwhm) short, while a transverse coherence length of 30 nm (fwhm) is feasible to resolve proteins on this scale. Whether this machine is capable of meeting these predictions or whether {{the dynamics of the}} electron beam will stay limited by accelerator components, is not finally determined {{by the end of this}} work, because commissioning and improvement of accelerator components is ongoing. Simultaneously, a compact DC <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>apparatus,</b> the E-Gun 300, designed for solid and liquid specimens and a target electron energy of 300 keV, was built. Fundamental design issues of the high potential carrying and beam generating components occurred and are limiting the maximum potential and electron energy to 120 keV. Furthermore, this is limiting the range of possible applications and consequently the design and construction of a brand new instrument began. The Femtosecond Electron Diffraction CAmera for Molecular Movies (FED-CAMM) bridges the performance problems of very high electric potentials and provides optimal operational conditions for all applied electron energies up to 300 keV. The variability of gap spacings and optimized manufacturing of the high voltage electrodes lead to the best possible electron pulse durations obtainable with a compact DC setup, that does not comprise of rf-structures. This third apparatus possesses pulse durations just a few tenth femtoseconds apart from the design limit of the highly relativistic REGAE and combines the advantages of simplicity and stability of a compact FED apparatus with the short temporal resolution of femtosecond accelerators, which are operated with or include rf structures. Simulations of the electron beam dynamics and the fact that the apparatus is stable in respect to high voltages and electric field gradients above 27 MV/m allows the conclusion, that a temporal resolution significantly below 100 fs (fwhm), perhaps even shorter than 70 fs, can be achieved. This instrument currently defines the state-of-the-art. Firstly, because high voltage feedthrough for these potentials are commercially still not available, with a subsequent limiting of the potentials and consequent lowering of the electron numbers per pulse as well as the pulse durations and electron penetration. Secondly, this is because research communities focus on photon and rf-based electron sources for the achievement of sub- 100 fs pulses, which typically include timing-jitter. Here it is shown that simple DC acceleration can lead to the same, satisfactory pulse duration up to an energy of a few hundred keV, potentially as high as 800 keV...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{design and}} {{construction}} of two new sample injection systems or nozzles, for use with the Oregon State <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> <b>apparatus</b> are discussed. One of these nozzles was intended for use with volatile samples the vapors of which were to be heated or cooled over the range - 196 to 540 °C; it is currently in regular use. The other nozzle, equipped with a sample volatilizing oven, was intended for use with relatively involatile materials, that is, materials having vapor pressures {{of only a few}} torr in the range 150 to 1200 °C. Only a prototype of this nozzle was constructed. The structures and particularly the torsional properties of the molecules diboron tetrafluoride, diboron tetrabromide, biacetyl (2, 3 - butanedione), and oxalyl chloride (ethanedioyl dichloride) have been investigated, For B₂F₄ nozzle-tip temperatures of - 50, 22, and 150 °C were used. In contrast to B₂Cl₄ which is staggered in the gas phase, the B₂F₄ molecule has a coplanar equilibrium conformation (symmetry D₂h). The effect of temperature change on the amplitude of torsional motion is commensurate with a description of this motion as slightly hindered internal rotation. The average value for the rotational barrier V₀ is 0. 418 (156) kcal/mol based on an assumed hindering potential of the form 2 V = V₀(1 -cos 2 o). An estimate of the fundamental torsional frequency gives 20 (4) cm⁻¹. For B₂Br₄ nozzle-tip temperatures of 23, 90, 150 and 305 °C were used. The molecule is like B₂C 1 ₄ in that it has a staggered equilibrium conformation (symmetry D₂d). The average of the rotational barrier for the four temperatures based on the assumed potential function for hindered rotation V = V₀(1 - cos 2 o) is V₀ = 3. 07 (. 33) kcal/mol. higher than that for B₂F₄ or B₂C 1 ₄. The estimated value for the torsional frequency is 18 (4) cm⁻¹. An earlier electron diffraction investigation of biacetyl at a nozzle-tip temperature of 228 °C revealed only a trans conformer, in contrast to certain similar conjugated systems which have substantial amounts of gauche rotameric forms as well. New experiments at 525 °C have been carried out with the same result: there is no evidence for the presence of any but the trans conformer. The structure and conformational properties of oxalyl chloride were studied by reanalyzing the data from experiments at 0, 80, and 190 °C obtained from an older investigation together with new data taken from experiments at 405 and 525 °C in terms of a more sophisticated model, The experiment at 525 °C resulted in essentially complete decomposition into, apparently, phosgene and carbon monoxide. In agreement with the former study, all evidence still indicates the gas to be a mixture of trans and gauche conformers. Making the approximation that the difference between the trans (torsion angle o) = 0 ⁰) and gauche conformers lies only in the torsion angle about the C-C bond, the average gauche torsion angle over all four temperatures is og = 93. 5 (8. 2) ⁰. The conformational analysis was based on an assumed rotational potential function of the form 2 V = ³∑i=₁Vi(1 - cos io). The average values of the three potential constants were found to be V₁ = 1. 94 (31), V₂ = - 0. 53 (. 24), and V₃ = 0. 70 (12) kcal/mol. Equilibrium constants were evaluated from the temperature dependence of the composition with the energy difference ΔE° = Eg° - Et° = 1. 72 (σ= 0. 29) kcal/mol and entropy difference ΔS° = Sg° - St° = 1. 8 (σ= 0. 8) cal/deg begin subsequently obtained...|$|E

The diffraction intensity is calculated {{on the basis of the}} kinematical theory. The program is extended to simulate <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> with a precession of incident electorn beam. The precession tecknique is one of the best way to get near-kinematical <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> data in experiement...|$|R
50|$|Reflection high-energy <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> (RHEED) is a {{technique}} used to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. RHEED systems gather information only from the surface layer of the sample, which distinguishes RHEED from other materials characterization methods that also rely on <b>diffraction</b> of high-energy <b>electrons.</b> Transmission electron microscopy, another common <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> method samples {{the bulk of the}} sample due to the geometry of the system. Low-energy <b>electron</b> <b>diffraction</b> (LEED) is also surface sensitive, but LEED achieves surface sensitivity through the use of low energy electrons.|$|R
