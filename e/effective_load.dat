60|$|Like {{all really}} serious and respectable British {{problems}} {{it has to}} be handled gently to prevent its coming to pieces in the gift. It is safest in charge of the expert, that wonderful last gift of time. He will talk rapidly about congestion, long-felt wants, low efficiency, economy, and get you into his building and rebuilding schemes with the minimum of doubt and head-swimming. He is like a good Hendon pilot. Unspecialised writers have the destructive analytical touch. They pull the wrong levers. So far as one can gather from the specialists on the question, there is very considerable congestion in many of the London thoroughfares, delays that seem to be avoidable occur in the delivery of goods, multitudes of empty vans cumber the streets, we have hundreds of acres of idle trucks--there are more acres of railway sidings than of public parks in Greater London--and our Overseas cousins find it ticklish work crossing Regent Street and Piccadilly. Regarding life simply as an affair of getting people and things from where they are to where they appear to be wanted, this seems all very muddled and wanton. So far it is quite easy to agree with the expert. And some of the various and entirely incompatible schemes experts are giving us by way of a remedy, appeal very strongly to the imagination. For example, there is the railway clearing house, which, it is suggested, should cover I do not know how many acres of what is now slumland in Shoreditch. The position is particularly convenient for an underground connection with every main line into London. Upon the underground level of this great building every goods train into London will run. Its trucks and vans will be unloaded, the goods passed into lifts, which will take every parcel, large and small, at once to a huge, ingeniously contrived sorting-floor above. There in a manner at once simple, ingenious and effective, they will be sorted and returned, either into delivery vans at the street level or to the trains emptied and now reloading on the train level. Above and below these three floors will be extensive warehouse accommodation. Such a scheme would not only release almost all the vast area of London now under railway yards for parks and housing, but it would give nearly every delivery van an <b>effective</b> <b>load,</b> and probably reduce the number of standing and empty vans or half-empty vans on the streets of London to a quarter or an eighth of the present number. Mostly these are heavy horse vans, and their disappearance would greatly facilitate the conversion of the road surfaces to the hard and even texture needed for horseless traffic.|$|E

40|$|Galactic {{winds are}} a key {{physical}} mechanism for understanding galaxy formation and evolution, yet empirical and theoretical constraints for the character of winds are limited and discrepant. Recent empirical models find that local star-forming galaxies have a deficit of oxygen that scales with galaxy stellar mass. The oxygen deficit provides unique empirical constraints on the magnitude of mass loss, composition of outflowing material and metal reaccretion onto galaxies. We formulate the oxygen deficit constraints so they may be easily implemented into theoretical models of galaxy evolution.

40|$|A general {{approach}} to develop complete and rigorous analytical expres-sions for the energy-release rates and phase angles for delamination of isotropic beam-like geometries is summarized. The analysis allows {{the effects of}} trans-verse shear to be correctly incorporated within the resulting expressions. The approach requires four <b>effective</b> crack-tip <b>loads</b> to be determined from the ap-plied loads: a moment, an axial force, a double transverse shear force, and a single transverse shear force. Each of these <b>effective</b> <b>loads</b> provides an energy-release rate and an associated phase angle; expressions for these quantities {{can be found in}} the literature. These fundamental expressions can be combined algebraically to generate analytical expressions for the total energy-release rate and phase angle for any geometry and loading configuration of interest. The approach is illustrated by general analyses of edge-notched flexure (ENF), end-loaded split (ELS) and 3 -point bending specimens. In particular, it is shown that the equation for the energy-release rate for the ENF geometry reduces to a very simple form that has previously been proposed from numerical studies, when the geometry is perfectly anti-symmetrical...|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{macrophage}} allows {{the possibility that}} this cell type {{could be used as}} drug delivery system to track therapeutic drug nanoparticles (NPs) in cancer. However, there is no existing research on the regulation between <b>effective</b> <b>loading</b> of NPs and targeted delivery of macrophages. Here, we investigated the important parameters of intracellular NP quantity and the vector migration rate. Macrophage loading capacity was obtained by comparing the uptake quantity of varisized NPs, and the delivery ability of loaded cells was determined by measuring vector migration rates. We observed a positive correlation between the size of NPs and directed macrophage migration. Our findings suggest that the molecular mechanism of migration vector rate regulation involved increased expression levels of colony-stimulating factor- 1 (CSF- 1) receptor and integrin induced by 100 -nm and 500 -nm particles. The ability of macrophages uptake to varisized NPs showed the opposite trend, with the increased vector rate of cell migration influenced by NPs. We are able to demonstrate the important balance between <b>effective</b> macrophage <b>loading</b> and targeted delivery.

50|$|Cellular Confinement Systems (CCS) {{have been}} used to improve the {{performance}} of both paved and unpaved roads by reinforcing the soil in the subgrade-base interface or within the base course. The <b>effective</b> <b>load</b> distribution of CCS creates a strong, stiff cellular mattress. This 3D mattress reduces vertical differential settlement into soft subgrades, improves shear strength, and enhances load-bearing capacity, while reducing the amount of aggregate material required to extend the service life of roads. As a composite system, cellular confinement strengthens the aggregate infill, thereby simultaneously enabling the use of poorly graded inferior material (e.g. local native soils, quarry waste or recycled materials) for infill as well as reducing the structural support layer thickness.Typical load support applications include reinforcement of base and subbase layers in flexible pavements, including: asphalt pavements; unpaved access, service and haul roads; military roads, railway substructure and ballast confinement; working platforms in intermodal ports; airport runways and aprons, permeable pavements; pipeline road support; green parking facilities and emergency access areas.|$|E
50|$|Owing to the {{anisotropic}} {{nature of}} this material, the hardness depends on the crystal orientation. The (002) plane contains the most covalent character and exhibits a maximum Vickers hardness value of 40.5 GPa, while the perpendicular planes were 6% lower at 38.1 GPa. These values decrease with increased load, settling at around 28 GPa each. The nanoindentation values {{were found to be}} 36.4 GPa and 34.0 GPa for the (002) and perpendicular planes respectively. The hardness values depend on the material purity and composition - the more boron the harder the boride - and the above values are for a Re:B ratio of approximately 1.00:1.85. Rhenium diboride also has a reported bulk modulus of 383 GPa and a shear modulus of 273 GPa. The hardness of rhenium diboride, and most other materials also depends on the load during the test. The above values of about 40 GPa were all measured with an <b>effective</b> <b>load</b> of 0.5-1 N. At such low load, the hardness values are also overestimated for other materials, for example it exceeds 100 GPa for c-BN. Other researchers, while having reproduced the high ReB2 hardness at low load, reported much lower values of 19-17 GPa at a more conventional load of 3-49 N, that makes ReB2 a hard, but not a superhard material.|$|E
