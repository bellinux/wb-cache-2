5|$|Final Fantasy XI has {{a largely}} player-based economy, {{with a heavy}} {{reliance}} on auction houses {{in each of the}} major cities of Vana'diel. There are certain economic controls in place mainly in the form of fees for putting items up for auction. Transportation, auction house, item storage, and fees do not go to players; these gil sinks effectively remove money from the economy to prevent inflation. The city of Jeuno used to levy a tax on bazaar purchases inside the city, but it was removed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> in the December 2008 version update.|$|E

The route heads northeast through a mix of agricultural and residential areas before turning east <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> of woodland and passing more farm fields and residences. MD 313 turns northeast into wooded residential areas and enters Millington, where it becomes Sassafras Street.|$|E
5|$|Other {{issues with}} regards to crashes, {{temporary}} freezes and long load times were found on single core computers, but these were ultimately addressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch.</b> A second patch, which reduced the amount mining time required to acquire upgrades, fixed some saved game loading issues, and addressed other minor bugs, was also released. On PlayStation 3, a concerning number of players reported that their save files can become corrupted if the game crashes unexpectedly. After community chief Chris Priestly of BioWare asked affected players to provide details about the issue, BioWare released a PlayStation 3 patch designed to combat save bugs and crashes experienced.|$|E

5|$|Peter Molyneux and James Leach came up {{with the}} idea of {{creating}} a Theme game based on a hospital, but Molyneux was not directly involved in development due to his work on Dungeon Keeper. Designers originally planned to include four distinct gameplay modes corresponding to historical time periods, but this was dropped due to time pressures on the team. Multiplayer support with up to four players was added <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch.</b> The game received a generally positive reception, with reviewers praising the graphics and humour in particular. Theme Hospital was a commercial success, selling over 4 million copies worldwide, and was ported to the PlayStation in 1998. A Sega Saturn version was in development, but cancelled. The game was re-released on GOG.com in 2012 and Origin in 2015, and the PlayStation version was released on the PlayStation Network in Europe in 2008, Japan in 2009, and North America in 2010. Revival attempts have been made with the development of open-source remakes such as CorsixTH.|$|E
5|$|Brannan {{was born}} in Saco, Maine, to Thomas and Sarah Emery Brannan. Because of {{problems}} with his abusive father, when he was fourteen years old Brannan moved with his sister (Mary Ann) and her husband (Alexander) to Painesville, Ohio. It was there that Brannan learned the printer's trade. During their journey to Ohio, the trio found themselves listening to two men whom they would later know as Orson Hyde and Heber C. Kimball. Brannan's brother-in-law bought {{a copy of the}} Book of Mormon from these street corner missionaries. In the neighboring town of Kirtland, Ohio, Brannan, Alexander, and Mary Ann all joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1842. After his father's death, Brannan inherited a decent sum of money, bought himself out of his last year of his apprenticeship, and invested the rest <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> of land near Cleveland. Soon after making his investment and hoping to get rich because of said investment, the market crashed and his land was worthless. He made a quick visit to Maine in order to see his ailing mother and then made his way to New Orleans where his brother Thomas was living. The Brannan brothers bought a press and type with what little money they had, but Thomas was taken by yellow fever shortly thereafter. After this tragedy, Brannan made {{his way back to the}} North, stopping in Indianapolis to promote a paper which ultimately failed, before he returned to Painesville.|$|E

25|$|The {{marginal}} value theorem {{is a type}} of optimality model that is often applied to optimal foraging. This theorem is used to describe a situation in which an organism searching for food <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> must decide when it is economically favorable to leave. While the animal is within a patch, it experiences the law of diminishing returns, where it becomes harder and harder to find prey as time goes on. This may be because the prey is being depleted, the prey begins to take evasive action and becomes harder to catch, or the predator starts crossing its own path more as it searches. This law of diminishing returns can be shown as a curve of energy gain per time spent <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> (Figure 3). The curve starts off with a steep slope and gradually levels off as prey becomes harder to find. Another important cost to consider is the traveling time between different patches and the nesting site. An animal loses foraging time while it travels and expends energy through its locomotion.|$|E

25|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature in}} the previous Serious Sam games was cooperative gameplay, in which multiple players could play the single-player campaign together. Serious Sam 2 focused on this game mode even more than its predecessors, {{as it was the}} only multiplayer mode to be included when the game was released, although deathmatch was later added <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch.</b> The PC version allows up to sixteen people to play together, while the Xbox version allows four players, either via Xbox systemlink or Xbox Live. Unlike the previous games, Serious Sam 2 does not support split-screen gameplay on the PC nor the Xbox.|$|E
25|$|In May, June or July, females {{normally}} lay {{a clutch}} of 1 to 11 eggs into a flask-shaped nest excavated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> of sandy or loamy soil. After 70 to 80 days of incubation, the eggs hatch, and the small hatchlings emerge from the nest in late summer. In the northern parts of its range, the common box turtle may enter hibernation in October or November. They burrow into loose soil, sand, vegetable matter, or mud {{at the bottom of}} streams and pools, or they may use a mammal burrow, and will remain in their chosen shelter until the cold winter has passed. The Common box turtle has been known to attain the greatest lifespan of any vertebrate outside of the tortoises. One specimen lived to be at least 138 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, a bee {{does not}} {{experience}} diminishing returns because of nectar depletion {{or any other}} characteristic of the flowers themselves. In fact, {{the total amount of}} nectar foraged increases linearly with time spent <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch.</b> However, the weight of the nectar adds a significant cost to the bee's flight between flowers and its trip back to the hive. Wolf and Schmid-Hempel showed, by experimentally placing varying weights on the backs of bees, that the cost of heavy nectar is so great that it shortens the bees' lifespan. The shorter the lifespan of a worker bee, the less overall time it has to contribute to its colony. Thus, there is a curve of diminishing returns for the net yield of energy that the hive receives as the bee gathers more nectar during one trip.|$|E

500|$|... "Mass Effect 2: Arrival" [...] was {{developed}} by BioWare and published by Electronic Arts. During development of Mass Effect 2, Bioware stated that downloadable content was becoming a fundamental part of the company's overall philosophy. The pack was accidentally revealed on February 21, 2011 {{by the addition of}} three new achievements <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> for the PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2. BioWare later stated that the addition of the achievements was intentional, but assumed they would be [...] "invisible". On March 14, 2011, the pack was formally confirmed to be in development via a brand new screenshot. BioWare explained that its purpose is to act as a bridge for Mass Effect 3. Although the base where most of the pack's events take place is located on an asteroid, early plans suggested that it would be set on an ocean planet. The base would be underwater and Shepard would reach the main level by submarine. Each section of the base would be in different [...] "containers", and would have a similar sense to James Cameron's 1989 film The Abyss. The pack was released on March 29, 2011 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The soundtrack was composed by Sonic Mayhem duo Sascha Dikiciyan and Cris Velasco, the same composers that penned the music from Mass Effect 2s earlier downloadable content [...] "".|$|E
500|$|However, in June 2011, users {{found that}} a trailer for Limbo {{appeared}} on the Steam software service, which video game publications such as PC Gamer took as a preliminary sign that a Microsoft Windows version would be released. Similarly, a possible PlayStation 3 version was projected based on the title appearing on the Korea Media Rating Board in June 2011. On 30 June 2011, Playdead announced their ports of the game to the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network, and to Microsoft Windows via Steam, later set for 19 July and 2 August 2011, respectively. Patti clarified that their change of mind from their earlier Xbox 360-exclusive approach was because [...] "we want as many people to play our games as possible". The release was set {{for nearly a year}} after the original availability of the Xbox 360 version, after the expiration of the Xbox 360 exclusivity rights for the game. Both the PlayStation 3 and Windows versions of the game have additional secret content, according to Patti; it is unknown if this content will be added <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> to the Xbox 360 version. Playdead has since published a Mac OS X version of the game through the Mac App Store in December 2011, fulfilling their promise to release the title before the end of 2011; though they had wanted to also release the Mac Steam version by then, this version was ultimately delayed to mid January 2012. A Linux version of the game, based on a Wine-encapsulated package prepared by CodeWeavers, premiered in the Humble Indie Bundle V charitable sales event in May 2012. A native port for Linux was later released on 19 June 2014, with porter Ryan C. Gordon bringing over the Wwise audio middleware that previously prevented a native port from being possible. The PlayStation Vita version of the game was developed by Playdead with assistance from the UK studio Double Eleven, and was released in June 2013. The Vita version does not use the handheld's touchpad features; Patti stated that they [...] "didn't feel it would suit Limbo at all" [...] and wanted to provide the [...] "original experience" [...] of the game to Vita players. The Vita version has Cross-play support with the PlayStation 3 version, allowing the user to buy the game once to play on either platform. The iOS version of the game was announced shortly before its release in July 2013, and was designed to optimize the game for use on the touchscreen devices.|$|E

2500|$|In this model, the {{currency}} being optimized is usually net energy gain per unit time. [...] The constraints are the travel {{time and the}} shape of the curve of diminishing returns.

[...] In order to maximize the currency, one wants the line with the greatest slope that still touches the curve (the tangent line).
