5|$|Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra {{commented that}} Robotrons success, along with Defender, {{illustrated}} that video game enthusiasts {{were ready for}} more difficult games with complex controls. Though {{not the first to}} implement it, Robotron: 2084s use of dual <b>joysticks</b> popularized the design among 2D shooting games, and has since been copied by other arcade-style games. The control scheme has appeared in several other titles produced by Midway Games: Inferno, Smash TV, and Total Carnage. Many shooting games on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network use this dual control design. The 2003 title Geometry Wars and its sequels also use a similar control scheme. The input design was most prominent in arcade games until video games with three-dimensional (3D) graphics became popular in the late 1990s. Jarvis attributes the lack of proliferation in the home market to the absence of hardware that offered two side-by-side <b>joysticks.</b> Most 3D games, however, use the dual joystick scheme to control the movement of a character and a camera. Few console games, like the 2004 title , use two <b>joysticks</b> for movement and attacking.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a force-reflection <b>joystick</b> system for VR-based simulation, {{including}} a 2 -DOF <b>joystick</b> {{and the related}} software. The developed force-reflection <b>joystick,</b> {{as a kind of}} haptic device, provides two-way communication in both position and force, and is very helpful for the user to interact with a simulation system. By considering the main factors in designing a force-reflection <b>joystick,</b> we build the <b>joystick</b> to be with the bandwidth, precision, and output torque comparable to the advanced commercial <b>joystick.</b> We also perform workspace analysis, system identification, and system modeling to better connect the <b>joystick</b> with the simulation system. To make it suitable for various applications, the software is developed to generate virtual motion constraints, so that the <b>joystick</b> is confined to operate within the workspace that corresponds to task requirements. In other words, the <b>joystick</b> may behave like a manipulative device specific for the given task. For demonstration, in experiments, we use the developed <b>joystick</b> system to emulate a virtual manual gearshift system...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To compare {{wheelchair}} {{driving performance}} in a driving simulator using a conventional <b>joystick</b> and an isometric <b>joystick.</b> Design: Randomized, cohort study. Setting: A research facility based in a hospital or in an independent living center. Participants: Participants (N= 20; 12 men, 8 women; mean age ± SD, 30. 62 ± 10. 91 y) who were at least 1 year post-TBI. Interventions: Driving performance using an isometric <b>joystick</b> compared with a conventional movement <b>joystick.</b> Main Outcome Measures: Average trial completion time, and trajectory-specific measures measured orthogonal {{to the center of}} driving tasks: root mean squared error, movement offset, movement error, and number of significant changes in heading. Results: After statistically controlling for driving speed, participants were able to complete the driving tasks faster with an isometric <b>joystick</b> than while using a conventional movement <b>joystick.</b> Compared with the conventional <b>joystick,</b> an isometric <b>joystick</b> used for driving forward demonstrated fewer driving errors. During reverse driving the conventional <b>joystick</b> performed better. Conclusions: The customizable isometric <b>joystick</b> seems to be a promising interface for driving a powered wheelchair for individuals with TBI. © 2011 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine...|$|R

5|$|Gotcha was {{designed}} by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, and a prototype was constructed by Cyan Engineering, Atari's semi-independent research and development subsidiary. Development began in July 1973 as part of Atari's strategy to develop multiple types of games to separate themselves from their competitors, who they saw as focused primarily on creating Pong clones. The cabinet {{was designed}} by George Faraco, initially with the <b>joysticks</b> encased in pink domes meant to represent breasts. Although this design inspired the advertising flyer on which it appears behind a man chasing {{a woman in a}} nightdress, it was changed to use regular <b>joysticks</b> soon after release.|$|E

5|$|After {{deciding}} {{to begin work}} on a coin-operated version of Spacewar, the pair, with assistance from Tuck's family, bought a PDP-11 and started working on a prototype. They spent a total of 20,000 to build a single arcade machine for two players, like the original Spacewar, {{deciding to}} price the game at ten cents per play or 25 cents for three games, with the winner of a match given a free game. They used a PDP-11/20 version of the PDP-11 (US$14,000), a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display (3,000), and spent the remainder on the coin acceptors, <b>joysticks,</b> wiring, and casing. Pitts build the computer hardware and handled the programming, while Tuck, a mechanical engineer, designed the enclosing cabinet. The display adapter for the monitor was built by Ted Panofski, the coin acceptors were sourced from jukebox manufacturer Rowe International, and the <b>joysticks</b> found at a military surplus store as remainders from B-52 bomber controls. The code for the game {{was based on a}} version of Spacewar running on a PDP-10 in the Stanford artificial intelligence lab, but modified with additional features.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} also {{inspired}} other titles. The 1990 arcade game Smash TV, also designed by Jarvis, features a similar design—two <b>joysticks</b> used to shoot numerous enemies {{on a single}} screen—as well as ideas he intended to include in sequels. In 1991, Jeff Minter released a shareware game titled Llamatron based on Robotron: 2084s design. Twenty years later, Minter released an upgraded version titled Minotron: 2112 on the iPhone.|$|E
5|$|The game {{made use}} of cutting edge {{technology}} such as force–feedback <b>joysticks</b> and controllers, 3D sound and Direct3D Hardware Acceleration and was largely well received. Critics noted that the game's graphics {{were some of the}} most technically impressive of the time. Overall, however, critics had mixed response for the graphics, as the demanding graphics resulted in poor draw distance; in particular, the PlayStation version struggled in this aspect. In general, the gameplay was favourably reviewed, with critics praising the solid, enjoyable missions, though there were complaints regarding a poor control system and unfairly high levels of difficulty.|$|E

5|$|A {{dedicated}} console {{version of}} Tank II was announced by Atari at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1977, but was cancelled {{by the end}} of the year; the <b>joysticks</b> for the game, designed by Kevin McKinsey, became the standard joystick controllers for the Atari 2600 (1977). The Atari 2600 game Combat, released in 1977, includes several variations of Tank, including ones with bouncing shots or invisible tanks. Combat was initially developed as a console version of the arcade game, like the cancelled dedicated console version, with additional plane-based game modes added during development. Despite Atari's cancellation of the dedicated console version of Tank, a dedicated console game inspired by Tank was still released in 1977 by Coleco: the Telstar game Telstar Combat! plays four variations of Tank, and was released prior to the Atari 2600 and Combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} USB1.0 specification, {{which was}} introduced in January 1996, defined data transfer rates of 1.5Mbit/s Low Speed and 12Mbit/s Full Speed. Microsoft Windows 95, OSR 2.1 provided OEM support for the devices. The first widely used version of USB was 1.1, which was released in September 1998. The 12Mbit/s data rate was intended for higher-speed devices such as disk drives, and the lower 1.5Mbit/s rate for low data rate devices such as <b>joysticks.</b> Apple Inc.'s iMac was the first mainstream product with USB and the iMac's success popularized USB itself.

5|$|Battletoads Arcade is a coin-operated, {{scrolling}} beat 'em up arcade video game. Up {{to three}} players, as the Battletoads (Rash, Pimple, and Zitz), punch and kick oncoming enemies through six levels {{to save their}} alternate universe from the Dark Queen. Arcade was the first Battletoads game to feature three-player cooperative multiplayer. Players control their characters with eight-directional <b>joysticks</b> and two buttons (attack and jump). Characters can run if the player pushes the joystick twice in the same direction. The Toads vary in fighting style: Rash is nimble, Pimple is burly, and Zitz is a balance of the two. As customary for the series, the Toads can knocked enemies offscreen such that they appear to fly towards the players, breaking the fourth wall. The Toads can also eat flies to regenerate health. Each Toad has its own signature exaggerated power and attack, in which their limbs turn into objects such as axes and drills. Enemies include aliens, mutant rodents, and snowmen.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil 6 allows {{players to}} select between four {{scenarios}} with interwoven storylines. Each scenario follows {{one of four}} main protagonists: Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller and Ada Wong. The player-characters from each scenario will have their own partners whom are controlled by either artificial intelligence (AI) or another player via local or online multiplayer. In addition, each scenario features a different play-style; for example, some player-characters are more vulnerable to attacks whereas others are more resilient. Each central character has unique abilities, which vary from increased reload times and carrying more ammunition. Resident Evil 6 presents new innovations and gameplay mechanics such as rolling in any direction and running whilst shooting and sliding. The game also features a four-player co-operative mode. When playing in single player mode, the player can allow another player to join in online at any time. While performing certain actions, quick time events may occur, in which the player must follow onscreen prompts by pressing buttons or manipulating <b>joysticks</b> within {{a limited amount of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Tank is an arcade game {{developed}} by Kee Games, {{a subsidiary of}} Atari, and released in November 1974. It was the only original title not based on an existing Atari property {{developed by}} Kee Games, which was founded to sell clones of Atari games to distributors as a fake competitor prior to the merger of the two companies. In the game, two players drive tanks through a maze viewed from above while attempting to shoot each other and avoid mines, represented by X marks, in a central minefield. Each player controls their tank {{with a pair of}} <b>joysticks,</b> moving them forwards and back to drive, reverse, and steer, and firing shells with a button to attempt to destroy the other tank. The destruction of a tank from a mine or shell earns the opposing player a point, and tanks reappear after being destroyed. The winner is the player with more points when time runs out, with each game typically one or two minutes long.|$|E
5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require {{so much to be}} excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming {{up with a way to}} display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: <b>joysticks</b> for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reception}} to Galaxy Game, Pitts and Tuck started work on an expanded prototype. For the second machine, they built a full blue fiberglass casing for the consoles, improved the quality of the <b>joysticks</b> {{with the help of a}} machine shop, and modified the computer with a newer display processor to support up to four games at once on different monitors—either multiple simultaneous separate games or up to four players playing the same game on two screens. They also placed the PDP-11 inside one of the consoles rather than in a separate location. While the original plan had been to work on driving down the development costs after the initial prototype, the popularity of the game convinced the pair to instead focus on making a better machine that could run multiple games to recoup the upfront investment. The new version was installed in a cafe in the student union building in June 1972, though with only two monitors due to space restrictions. The original Galaxy Game prototype was displayed at several locations around the area, but was not as successful as it had been at the student union building. By the time the second prototype was completed the pair had spent US$65,000 on the project and had no feasible way of making up the cost with the machine or commercial prospects for a wider release. Pitts later explained that he and Tuck had been focused on the engineering and technical challenges of producing a faithful coin-operated Spacewar game and paid little attention to the business side of the project; he felt that Computer Space had been more commercially successful because Bushnell had focused more on the business side of his idea than the technical.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{describe}} usability tests {{to evaluate a}} gestural <b>joystick</b> as a new input device. The usability of a device addresses five main issues: learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction. These different measures of usability are used {{in an attempt to}} compare the gestural <b>joystick,</b> called ”wearable joystick”, with four different input devices. This paper reviews the wearable <b>joystick</b> and then describes the quantitative methods for the measures. The claimed features of the wearable <b>joystick</b> include easy and wire-free installation into regular gloves, unencumbered operation, and intuitive control. While the analyses are preliminary, with only five users per device, the results are mixed. In general, results suggest the glove provides adequate performance for users, scoring within norms of other devices for a small sample size. However, several of the measures show that the performances of the wearable <b>joystick</b> are worse than other input devices. Despite such drawbacks, the wearable <b>joystick,</b> of all input devices tested, has significant advantages, such as wearability, a simple but strong sensor mechanism, and a natural and intuitive use paradigm. We envision that as the data processing algorithm of the wearable <b>joystick</b> are improved and the full range of benefits can be compared, the wearable <b>joystick</b> will overcome these drawbacks in the near future.
