25|$|Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, the Tutte {{polynomial}} can be arbitrarily well approximated {{along the}} positive branch of , equivalently, the partition {{function of the}} ferromagnetic Ising model. This exploits the close connection between the Ising model {{and the problem of}} counting matchings in a graph. The idea behind this celebrated result of Jerrum and Sinclair <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a Markov chain whose states are the matchings of the input graph. The transitions are defined by choosing edges at random and modifying the matching accordingly. The resulting Markov chain is rapidly mixing and leads to “sufficiently random” matchings, which can be used to recover the partition function using random sampling. The resulting algorithm is a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (fpras).|$|E

[...] "Never deceived them," [...] McCain once said, [...] "They have been deceived too {{many times in the}} last 200years." [...] Along with Senator Daniel Inouye and Representative Mo Udall, McCain {{was one of the main}} drafters of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises and established the balance between Indian tribal sovereignty and regulatory oversight by the states of such activity. [...] After its passage, McCain stated his personal opposition to Indian gaming, but said that when communities under poverty [...] "are faced with only one option for economic development, and that <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> gambling on their reservations, then I cannot disapprove." [...] The Act enabled the growth of what would become, two decades later, the $23 billion Indian gaming industry, and McCain has been called [...] "one of the founding fathers of Indian gaming." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{customary}} way {{of enforcing}} authority control in a bibliographic catalog <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a separate index of authority records, which relates to and governs the headings {{used in the}} main catalog. This separate index {{is often referred to}} as an [...] "authority file." [...] It contains an indexable record of all decisions made by cataloguers in a given library (or—as is increasingly the case—cataloguing consortium), which cataloguers consult when making, or revising, decisions about headings. [...] As a result, the records contain documentation about sources used to establish a particular preferred heading, and may contain information discovered while researching the heading which may be useful.|$|E
2500|$|The idea {{of using}} an initial {{property}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> the problem in terms of some auxiliary category E, and then identify that {{what we want is}} to find an initial object of E. [...] This has an advantage that the optimization—the sense that we are finding the most efficient solution—means something rigorous and is recognisable, rather like the attainment of a supremum. [...] The category E is also formulaic in this construction, since it is always the category of elements of the functor to which one is constructing an adjoint. In fact, this latter category is precisely the comma category over the functor in question.|$|E

[...] Given what Bentham says about second order evils it would be a serious misrepresentation to say that he and similar act utilitarians would be prepared to punish an innocent person for the greater good. Nevertheless, whether they would agree or not, this is what critics of utilitarianism claim is entailed by the theory. A classic version of this criticism was given by H. J. McCloskey: ...|$|E

2500|$|The goal of WALTA <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> {{detectors}} {{at least}} 32 {{sites in the}} Seattle area, covering an area of 200 square kilometers. [...] This area would {{be large enough to}} detect events above the GZK cutoff. [...] The program hopes to fill in gaps in this area as the project matures. [...] Each location has four scintillation detectors which emit light when hit by charged particles. [...] Each paddle detectors is about an inch thick and covers approximately one square meter. [...] Each site would ideally put the detectors in a star formation with one detector in the middle and three surrounding it on a circle of 10m2 radius. [...] With this geometry, each site could detect 1015eV events. [...] Each site will attempt this layout as best possible given the site's own geography. [...] Each detector has a photomultiplier tube which multiplies the emitted light into a large electrical signal. [...] The signal from each detector paddle goes into a data acquisition card (DAQ) which is set to record an event based on a certain coincidence. [...] The DAQ card also has a GPS input. [...] The output of this card connects to a computer using a serial port and software counts the data with a GPS location and time stamp. [...] A site can upload the data to the WALTA server and data can be compared to see if events happen from the same shower. [...] The timing of events and the area covered tells the energy and location where the cosmic ray hit the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

These ideas have the innate tendency to realize themselves, {{the will of the}} subject being weakened. This is why the left hand is often used. These ideas disassociate themselves {{from the rest of the}} mental organism and may, in highly developed cases, become what is called a 'secondary personality.' They may give a weak imitation of discourse. They may assume a vague resemblance to some other individual, but they can never give a full statement or a new statement.

6000|$|The same caution {{will apply}} to our marked {{peculiarity}} of {{style in the}} book, which may offend at first many persons otherwise most capable of entering into its spirit. I mean the constant, and so to speak, pervading use of Scripture language and incidents, not only {{side by side with}} the most grotesque effusions of humour, but as one main element of the ludicrous effects produced. This undoubtedly would be as really offensive as it would be untrue, from any other point of view perhaps than that of a New Englander bred in the country. The rural population of New England is still, happily for itself, tinctured in all its language, habits, modes of feeling and thought, by a strict Scriptural training--"Out of the fulness of the heart the mouth speaketh." [...] Look below the surface and you will see that there is no irreverence whatever beneath Hosea Biglow's daring use of Scripture; only that [...] "perfect love which casteth out fear;" [...] that the very purpose of the whole book <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> Christ's Gospel as the standard by which alone all men are to be judged in all their acts.

60|$|Best {{place for}} a Cache.--The best {{position}} to choose for a cache is in a sandy or gravelly soil, on account of its dryness and the facility of digging. Old burrows, or the gigantic but abandoned hills of white ants, may be thought of, if the stores are enclosed in cases of painted tin: also clefts in rocks: some things can be conveniently buried under water. The place must be chosen under circumstances that admit of your effacing all signs of the ground having been disturbed. A good plan <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> your tent and to dig a deep hole in the floor, depositing {{what you have to}} bury wrapped in an oil-cloth, in an earthen jar, or in a wooden vessel, according to what you are able to get. It must be secure against the attacks of the insects of the place: avoid the use of skins, for animals will smell and dig them out. Continue to inhabit the tent for at least a day, well stamping and smoothing down the soil at leisure. After this, change the position of the tent, shifting the tethering-place or kraal of your cattle to where it stood. They will speedily efface any marks that may be left. Travellers often make their fires over the holes where their stores are buried; but natives are so accustomed to suspect fireplaces, that this plan does not prove to be safe. During summer travel, in countries pestered with gnats, a smoke fire for the horses (that is, a fire for keeping off flies), made near the place, will attract the horses and cause them to trample all about. This is an excellent way of obliterating marks left about the cache.|$|E
