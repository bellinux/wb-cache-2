Nature at last prevailed; Johann Sigismund lifted his hand (princely etiquettes melting all into smoke on the sudden), and gave the young jackanapes a slap over the face. Veritable slap; which opened in a dreadful manner the eyes of young Pfalz-Neuburg to his real situation; and sent him off high-flaming, vowing never-imagined vengeance. A remarkable slap; well testified to,--though the old Histories, struck blank with terror, reverence and astonishment, can for most part only symbol it in dumb-show; [Pufendorf (Rer. Brandenb. lib. iv.? 16, p. 213), and many others, are in this case. Tobias Pfanner (Historia Pacis Westphalicae, lib. i.? 9, p. 26) is explicit: [...] "Neque, ut infida regnandi societas est, Brandenburgio et Neoburgio diu conveniebat; eorumque jurgia, cum matrimonii faedere pacari posse propinqui ipsorum credidissent, acrius ezarsere; inter epulas, quibus futurum generum Septemvir (the [...] "Sevensman," [...] or Elector, [...] "One of The Seven") excipiebat, hujus enim filia Wolfgango sperabatur, ob nescio quos sermones eo inter utrumque altercalione provecta, ut Elector irae impotestior, nulla dignitatis, hospitii, cognationis, affinitatisve verecundia cohibitus, intenderit Neoburgio manus, et contra tendentis os verberaverit.

50|$|The glaciers of Georgia {{are mainly}} located along the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range.The spatial {{distribution}} of contemporary glaciers in the territory of Georgia is stipulated by the peculiarities of atmospheric processes, morphological-morphometric conditions of the relief and their interaction. Main centers of glaciation {{are related to the}} elevated Greater Caucasus watershed range and Kazbegi massif. Individual centers {{can be found in the}} Greater Caucasus branch ranges: Bzipi, Kodori, Samegrelo, Svaneti, Lechkhumi, Pirikita, etc. According to the data of 2015 there are 637 glaciers in Georgia with a total area of 355.80 km2. Contemporary glaciers are mainly concentrated in the Enguri, Rioni, Kodori and Tergi River basins, where there are the peaks of 4500 m and higher. 89.32% of the amount and 97.15% of the area of glaciers of Georgia are located in these basins. Contemporary glaciers are unevenly distributed between the different river basins. Here the leading place belongs to the Enguri River basin; 42.22% of the total number of the glaciers of Georgia is the share of it, as well as 62.78% of the total area of the glaciers of Georgia is a share of the Enguri River basin. Except the Enguri River basin the shares of the other river basins in the total number of the glaciers of Georgia are distributed as follows: the Kodori River basin - 22.76%; the Rioni River basin - 15.22%; the Tergi River basin - 9.10%; the Pirikita Alazani River basin - 3.19%; the Bzipi River basin - 2.82%; the Liakhvi River basin - 1.56% and the Khobistskali River basin - 1.41%. As for the basins of the rivers of Arghuni, Asa, Aragvi and Kelasuri, their <b>joint</b> <b>share</b> is 1.72% of the total number of the glaciers of Georgia. Except the Enguri River basin the shares of the other river basins in the total area of the glaciers of Georgia are distributed as follows: the Rioni River basin - 13.11%; the Kodori River basin - 11.25%; the Tergi River basin - 9.99%; the Bzipi River basin - 1.12%; the Pirikita Alazani River basin - 0.68%. As for the basins of the rivers of Liakhvi, Asa, Khobistskali, Arghuni, Aragvi and Kelasuri, their <b>joint</b> <b>share</b> is 1.07% of the total area of the glaciers of Georgia. Great Georgian scientist Vakhushti Bagrationi gives the first scientific information on the glaciers of Georgia in the beginning of the 18th century. are big mountains, which have the Caucasus to the North from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea, the height of which is of one day walking and the highest of it is permanently frosty, the length of the ice is of k-l arm, and in summer it breaks and, if a man stays there, he cannot endure the cold even for a little time; and under it the rivers flow, and the ice is green and red, as a rock due to its age”. After almost hundred years the foreign scientists began to describe the glaciers of Georgia. Information about the glaciers of Georgia can be found in the works of G. Abikh (1865), G. Radde (1873), N. Dinik (1884), I. Rashevskii (1904), etc. This information is related to the individual glaciers and mostly is of descriptive nature. However, their findings greatly assist us in determining the dynamics of the individual glaciers. In the years of 1880-1910 the topographical surveying of the Greater Caucasus was carried out. On the basis of the created maps K. I. Podozerskiy (1911) compiled the first detailed catalogue of the glaciers, which still has not lost its importance, but it must be mentioned, that the errors were made during its compilation. A. L. Reinhardt (1916, 1917) noted these errors further, who compiled the new catalogue for many glacial basins of the investigated region and defined the location of the snow line. The research conducted by A. Reinhardt is of high quality and more reliable by its scientific value in comparison with its previous researchers. Interesting researches were conducted by F. Rutkovskaia (1936) in connection with the 2nd International Polar Year. In 1932-1933 the glaciations of the Enguri River was studied and the dynamics (in the one-year period) of the individual glaciers were identified. In 1959 P. A. Ivankov gave us the total number and area of glaciers of the study area based on the new topographic maps and the aeroimages of 1946. In the same year P. Kovalev (1961) described in details the glaciers and carried out their labeling. Much work has been conducted by D. Tsereteli for the study of the glaciers of Georgia, who in 1937 together with Al. Aslanikashvili surveyed several glaciers and in 1963 gave us the dynamics of the glaciers during the period of 1937-1960. Particularly should be mentioned the great and versatile work, which was done by the Glaciological Laboratory of Vakhushti Bagrationi Institute of Geography, the multiannual work of which is summarized in the 1975 year’s edition of the Catalogue of Glaciers, as well as by the Hydrographical Division of the Hydro-Meteorological Department, which published the work about the Glaciers of the Greater Caucasus (Editors: V. Tsomaia and E. Drobishev, 1970). It should be also noted the many years research of various glaciers in the major river basins by R. Gobejishvili. It can be considered his honor that after the 1990s the glaciological studies have not been stopped in Georgia. L. Maruashvili, D. Ukleba. T. Kikalishvili, G. Kurdghelaidze, D. Tabidze, R. Khazaradze, O. Nikolaishvili, V. Tsomaia, O. Drobishevi, R. Shengelia, R. Gobejishvili, K. Mgeladze, T. Lashkhi, Sh. Inashvili, N. Golodovskaia, L. Serebryannii, A. Orlov, O. Nadirashvili, N. Zakarashvili, A. Rekhviashvili, O. Samadbegishvili and others studied the glaciers of Georgia according to the river basins. Glacial-geomorphological works were being carried out from 1968 (R. Gobejishvili). The largest glaciers of the different river basins were surveyed by the photo-theodolite method, such as: Zopkhito-Laboda, Kirtisho, Brili, Chasakhtomi, Edena, Khvargula, Boko, Buba, Tbilisa, Adishi, Chalaati, Dolra, Kvishi, Ladevali, Shkhara, Namkvani, Koruldashi, Marukhi, Klichi and the cirque type glaciers of the Klichi basin. Today in Georgia the Vakhushti Bagrationi Institute of Geography is the only institution, which scientifically researches the Caucasus glaciers. Glaciological group, by the leadership of Levan Tielidze, every year conducts glaciological expeditions to the Caucasus glaciers in the different river basins.|$|E
30|$|Argentina {{accounted}} for more than one-third of all Latin American exports in 1928, one-fourth in 1938 and only one-eighth in 1954. It exported mainly primary goods: corn, wheat, linen, wool and meat. The <b>joint</b> <b>share</b> of these five goods in world trade declined from 8.6 % in 1926 – 1929 to 3.9 % in 1960. Nevertheless, the fact that Argentina’s market share was halved during that period provides evidence of Argentina’s decline relative to other agricultural exporters. Overall, if we consider the world exports of these five primary products, Argentina {{accounted for}} 1.8 % of those exports in the late 1920 s and for only 0.4 % in 1960. If we analyze export trends by product, we see that, in that same period, Argentina’s market share in corn decreased from 57 % to 21 %, in wheat from 20 % to 9 %, in linen from 73 % to 40 % and in meat from 40 % to 24 %, while its market share in wool remained unchanged at around 6 % (see Llach 2006). The stagnation of Argentine exports placed an inescapable constraint on the country’s growth.|$|E

40|$|In adults, motoneurone {{pools of}} {{synergistic}} muscles that act around a common <b>joint</b> <b>share</b> a common presynaptic drive. Common drive can be revealed by both time domain and {{frequency domain analysis}} of EMG signals. Analysis in the frequency domain reveals significant coherence in the range 1 – 45 Hz, with maximal coherence in low (1 – 12 Hz) and high (16 – 32 Hz) ranges. The high-frequency range depends on cortical drive to motoneurones and is coherent with cortical oscillations at ∼ 20 Hz frequencies. It is of interest to know whether oscillatory drive to human motoneurone pools changes with development. In the present study we examined age-related changes in coherence between rectified surface EMG signals recorded from the short and long thumb abductor muscles during steady isometric contraction obtained while subjects abducted the thumb against a manipulandum. We analysed EMG data from 36 subjects aged between 4 and 14 years, and 11 adult subjects aged between 22 and 59 years. Using the techniques of pooled coherence analysis and the χ 2 difference of coherence test we demonstrate that {{between the ages of}} 7 and 9 years, and 12 and 14 years, there are marked increases in the prevalence and magnitude of coherence at frequencies between 11 and 45 Hz. The data from subjects aged 12 – 14 years were similar to those obtained from adult controls. The most significant differences between younger children and the older age groups were detected at frequencies close to 20 Hz.

40|$|In several murine {{models of}} {{autoimmune}} arthritis, Th 17 cells are the dominant initiators of inflammation. In human arthritis {{the majority of}} IL- 17 –secreting cells within the joint express a cytokine phenotype intermediate between Th 17 and Th 1. Here we show that Th 17 / 1 cells from the joints of children with inflammatory arthritis express high levels of both Th 17 and Th 1 lineage-specific transcription factors, RORC 2 and T-bet. Modeling the generation of Th 17 / 1 in vitro, we show that Th 17 cells “convert” to Th 17 / 1 under conditions that mimic the disease site, namely low TGFβ and high IL- 12 levels, whereas Th 1 cells cannot convert to Th 17. Th 17 / 1 cells from the inflamed <b>joint</b> <b>share</b> T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality with Th 17 cells, suggesting a shared clonal origin between Th 17 and Th 17 / 1 cells in arthritis. Using CD 161, a lectin-like receptor that is a marker of human Th 17, we show synovial Th 17 and Th 17 / 1 cells, and unexpectedly, {{a large proportion of}} Th 1 cells express CD 161.
