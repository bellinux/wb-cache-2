Both ships head for the talks as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can.</b> As Enterprise nears the planet, Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey moves to intercept. With Enterprise unable to track his ship's position, Chang inflicts severe damage on Enterprise and then Excelsior. At the suggestion of Uhura, the Enterprise's communication officer, Spock and McCoy modify a photon torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's vessel, using equipment originally intended to study gaseous anomalies. The torpedo impact reveals Chang's location, and Enterprise and Excelsior destroy the Bird of Prey with a volley of torpedoes. Crew from both ships beam to the conference and halt an attempt on the Federation president's life. Kirk pleads for those present to continue the peace process. Having saved the peace talks, Enterprise is ordered back to Earth by Starfleet Command to be decommissioned, but the crew decide to take their time on the return voyage. As Enterprise cruises towards a nearby star, Kirk proclaims that though this mission is the final cruise of Enterprise under his command, others will continue their voyages.|$|E

Animals, of course, do not aim to pollinate, they aim to collect food as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can.</b> However, many pollinator species exhibit constancy, passing up available flowers to focus on one plant species. Why should animals specialize on a plant species, rather than move to the next flower of any species? Although pollinator constancy [...] was recognized by Aristotle, the benefits to animals are not yet fully understood. The most common hypothesis is that pollinators must learn to handle particular types of flowers, and they have limited capacity to learn different types. They can only efficiently gather rewards from one type of flower.|$|E

He is the first to describe a law of football: [...] "They often break one another's shins when two meet and strike both together against the ball, and therefore there is a law that they must not strike higher than the ball". His account of the ball itself is also very informative: [...] "They blow a strong bladder and tie the neck of it as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> and then put it into the skin of a bull's cod and sew it fast in". He adds: [...] "The harder the ball is blown, the better it flies. They used to put quicksilver into it sometimes to keep it from lying still".

40|$|Pain {{perception}} {{arises from}} a complex interaction between a nociceptive stimulus and different emotional and cognitive factors, which {{appear to be}} mediated by both automatic and controlled systems. Previous evidence has shown that whereas conscious processing of unpleasant stimuli enhances pain perception, emotional influences on pain under unaware conditions are much less known. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the modulation of pain perception by unconscious emotional pictures through an emotional masking paradigm. Two kinds of both somatosensory (painful and non-painful) and emotional stimulation (negative and neutral pictures) were employed. Fifty pain-free participants were asked to rate the perception of pain they were feeling in response to laser-induced somatosensory stimuli <b>as</b> <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can.</b> Data from pain intensity and reaction times were measured. Statistical analyses revealed a significant effect for the interaction between pain and emotional stimulation, but surprisingly this relationship was opposite to expected. In particular, lower pain intensity scores and longer reaction times were found in response to negative images being strengthened this effect for painful stimulation. Present findings suggest a clear pain perception modulation by unconscious emotional contexts. Attentional capture mechanisms triggered by unaware negative stimulation could explain this phenomenon leading to a withdrawal of processing resources from pain...|$|R

40|$|Multithreaded {{applications}} are <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> effectively exploit {{the capabilities of}} modern computer systems. The purpose of this thesis is to present the efficiency of multithreaded applications {{with the use of}} a simple Windows console application which copies files from one directory to another using different thread pools. In this thesis we describe the ways of developing multithreaded applications, some limitations which should be taken into account when developing multithreaded applications, and the principles of protecting the access to shared data from different threads simultaneously. A console application for the copying of files was developed in Visual Studio 2010 in C++ programming language. Based on the input parameter, the application determines the number of working threads in a thread pool and then assigns a specific task to each thread. The efficiency of the application was tested with various test cases and the results are suitably presented. We learned that multithreaded {{applications are}} more efficient for the copying of larger files although the hard disk presents a certain limitation. A higher number of worker threads does not increase the efficiency of the application when copying smaller files which is a faster operation. The time needed for creating new worker threads and for checking whether any threads are free decreases the efficiency of the application if the number of worker threads is too high...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} {{a new model}} for describing jobs and tasks for real-time systems. Using this model can improve utilization bounds on uniform multiprocessors, in which each processor has an associated speed. Traditionally, a job executing on a processor of speed s for t units of time will perform s × t units of work. However, this uniform scaling only occurs if tasks are completely CPU bound. In practice, tasks will have some portion of execution that does not scale with the increased CPU speed. Dividing the execution into CPU execution and fixed execution allows the scheduler to place CPU bound tasks on <b>faster</b> processors, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{take full advantage of}} the extra speed. This model is used in a new utilization test for EDF scheduling with restricted migration, r-EDF, in which tasks are allowed to migrate, but only at job boundaries. The test is proven to be better than the existing r-EDF test for uniform multiprocessors...|$|R

5000|$|The Longest Reverse in the World: A {{straight}} 1.0 km lane {{is set up}} {{with various}} obstacles on the sides, including cars, concrete barriers, wooden boxes and foam shapes, getting a little wider with each section. The candidates are given one chance to reverse down the entire course in the 19 ft long 1976 Cadillac Calais. The drivers are each told to take it <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> reasonably <b>can,</b> but to do it safely. Polly quickly starts hitting things, thanks to her over-steering and veering toward the driver's side, something that Andrew and the experts note is unusual given {{that the vast majority}} of bad drivers usually hit on the passenger side. At the end, she admits that she was staring at the driver's side obstacles rather than where she wanted to go. Sholom has a similar set of issues, over-steering and looking from side-to-side rather than at the end of the course, and he posts a similarly poor run. Renee does well for most of her run, but gets increasingly flustered, eventually causing her to leave the course altogether and nearly hit the camera car. Jordan has the best run of the day, only hitting two objects late in the course. Jillian starts off well, but her run rapidly falls apart after she hits a parked car early on. Despite the best efforts of Andrew and Mitchell, she becomes overwhelmed with stress, and ends up hitting a lot of things during her run. After this, Andrew decides to send her on a public drive with Tim, and for the most part she proves far less nervous than she did during the previous episode's public drive, even though she gets nervous while handling lane changes.|$|R

As discovery and development of new chemical agents is a complex, expensive and time consuming process, so recent trends are shifting toward designing and developing innovative drug delivery systems for existing drugs. Out of those, drug delivery system being very eminent among pediatrics and geriatrics is orally disintegrating films (ODFs). These fast disintegrating films have superiority over <b>fast</b> disintegrating tablets <b>as</b> the latter {{are associated with the}} risks of choking and friability. This drug delivery system has numerous advantages over conventional <b>fast</b> disintegrating tablets <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be used for dysphasic and schizophrenic patients and are taken without water due to their ability to disintegrate within a few seconds releasing medication in mouth. Various approaches are employed for formulating ODFs and among which solvent casting and spraying methods are frequently used. Generally, hydrophilic polymers along with other excipients are used for preparing ODFs which allow films to disintegrate quickly releasing incorporated active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) within seconds. Orally disintegrating films have potential for business and market exploitation because of their myriad of benefits over orally disintegrating tablets.
