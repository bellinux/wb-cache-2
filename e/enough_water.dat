5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient to justify the construction of a dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would actually make available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> to fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn could deliver <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> to justify its own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E

As it struck the sea floor, the bow was torn {{from the rest of}} the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship's engine rooms.|$|E
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong {{opposition to the}} project. This opposition came first from engineers who felt that the covering was incompatible with Brussels’s geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases {{and would not be}} able to handle <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> to prevent floods. Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the lack of public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E

5|$|Marine General Rathvon M.

Had they simply contaminated the stream, the airlift would not have provided <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> to the Marines. Marine Lieutenant General Victor Krulak seconded the notion that there was never a serious intention to take the base by also arguing that neither the water supply nor the telephone land lines were ever cut by the North Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|Plants face severe {{challenges}} in arid environments. Problems {{they need to}} solve include how to obtain <b>enough</b> <b>water,</b> how to avoid being eaten and how to reproduce. Photosynthesis {{is the key to}} plant growth. It can only take place during the day as energy from the sun is required, but during the day, many deserts become very hot. Opening stomata to allow in the carbon dioxide necessary for the process causes evapotranspiration, and conservation of water is a top priority for desert vegetation. Some plants have resolved this problem by adopting crassulacean acid metabolism, allowing them to open their stomata during the night to allow CO2 to enter, and close them during the day, or by using C4 carbon fixation.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are gregarious, feeding in {{flocks of}} up to 100 birds. As a {{consequence}} of their dry diet, they need to visit water sources regularly. Drinking times vary among the species. Ten species drink at dawn, four at dusk and two at indeterminate times. When drinking, water is sucked into the beak which is then raised to let the water flow down into the crop. By repeating this procedure rapidly, <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> to last twenty four hours can be swallowed in a few seconds. As they travel to water holes, they call to {{members of their own}} species and many hundreds or thousands synchronise their arrival at the drinking site despite converging from many different locations scattered over hundreds of square miles (kilometres) of territory.|$|E

5|$|The {{report was}} the result of many {{cooperating}} agencies that often had conflicting goals. An initial draft was submitted to Everglades National Park management who asserted not <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> would be released to the park quickly enough—that the priority went to delivering water to urban areas. When they threatened to refuse to support it, the plan was rewritten to provide more water to the park. However, the Miccosukee Indians have a reservation in between the park and water control devices, and they threatened to sue to ensure their tribal lands and a $50million casino would not be flooded. Other special interests were also concerned that businesses and residents would take second priority after nature. The Everglades, however, proved to be a bipartisan cause. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000. It approved the immediate use of $1.3billion for implementation to be split by the federal government and other sources.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance developed in late November, and two disturbances {{formed in the}} first few weeks of January. In the duration between when Iletta developed on January23 and when Tropical Cyclone Josie formed on February9, another two {{tropical disturbance}}s formed, and the final two developed after Lisette originated in late February. The first, Tropical Disturbance M1, formed on May11 in the northeastern portion of the basin, and later crossed into the Australian region to intensify into Tropical Cyclone Rhonda. The final disturbance of the season originated from a persistent area of convection near the equator on July19, northeast of Diego Garcia. With warm <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> temperatures, the system developed further, becoming Tropical Depression M2 on July20, the first July depression since 1971. That day, the JTWC classified the storm as Tropical Cyclone 01S. As the JTWC considers the tropical cyclone year to begin on July1, and the MFR considered it beginning on August1 at the time, the storm was in different cyclone years in different agencies. Estimates from the Dvorak technique suggested that the system approached tropical storm status on July21 after a central dense overcast formed, although the MFR only estimated peak 10minute winds of 55km/h (35mph). Moving southwestward and later to the west, the depression began weakening due to wind shear on July23, and dissipated two days later. At the time, July was within the annual tropical cyclone year, although a change in policy shifted the end of the tropical cyclone year to June30, beginning in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Second, Frederick's {{most egregious}} mistake was {{his refusal to}} {{consider}} the recommendations of his trusted staff. Brother Henry, a superb tactician and strategist in his own right, reasonably suggested halting the battle at mid-day, after the Prussians had secured the first height and Wunsch, the city. Wunsch could not move across the river; only one bridge remained, and Laudon's cavalry guarded it fiercely. Regardless, from these vantage points, the Prussians would be unassailable, and eventually, the Austro-Russian force would have to withdraw. Furthermore, Henry argued, the troops were exhausted from several days of marching, the weather was appallingly hot, {{they did not have}} <b>enough</b> <b>water,</b> and they had not had a good meal in several days. Instead of holding his secure position, though, Frederick forced his tired troops to descend the hill, cross the low ground, and ascend the next hill, in the face of heavy fire. The Prussian cavalry effort initially drove back the Russian and Austrian squadrons, but the fierce cannon and musketry fire from the united Allied front inflicted staggering losses on Frederick's much-vaunted horsemen. Furthermore, he committed perhaps the gravest of errors in sending his cavalry into battle piecemeal and against entrenched positions.|$|E

5|$|The new route added several locks to the canal, making {{water supply}} {{problems}} more severe. Because {{of the way}} the system of locks work, water is lost from the upper part of a canal each time a vessel passes through. This is a particular issue for the pound between Bradford Lock at Bradford on Avon and the Bath Locks, where a series of locks need to be opened each time the gates are opened. Most lock gates are not watertight, therefore some water leaks from the higher levels of the canal to those lower down. The water has to be replaced, or eventually the upper levels of the canal would not hold <b>enough</b> <b>water</b> to be navigable. Canals are usually fed by diverting water from streams and rivers into the upper parts of the canal, but if no suitable source is available or sufficient, a pumping station, such as the one at Claverton, can be used to maintain the water level. Crofton Pumping Station was built to supply water to the summit pound of the canal, opening in 1810 but, unlike Claverton, was powered by steam.|$|E
