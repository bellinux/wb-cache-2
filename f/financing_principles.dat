Taking into account conditions of local economy functioning, in which local authorities are decisive subjects (local administration and people's councils) the author formulates an opinion that postulates on decentralization, which are stated in discussions, practically refer to substitution of centralized set with mixed set — and not decentralized one — of local economy. Centralized set {{can not be}} fully abolished even when mixed set is a predominating set of local economy functioning. Anyway it does not eliminate the possibility of competence expansion of leading local authorities. In such situation decentralized set of local economy functioning, in strict meaning of the word, can play a marginal role only.

It takes point of departure in previous research where {{it has been suggested that}} <b>financing</b> <b>principles</b> for benefits systems matters in this respect. In order to elaborate on that hypothesis, the tax-financed Peoples´ Pension is compared with the supplementary pension which is financed by social contributions. Results show that both eligibility and the right to export benefits where developed at an earlier stage and to a greater extent in the supplementary pension scheme. This result is in line with previous research. In addition, results also reveal that expanded eligibility does not automatically lead up to a right to export benefits. This is especially clear with respect to the development of the Peoples´ Pension. It is thus concluded that the development of both eligibility and exportability reflects the internal logic that is inherent with the relationship between contributions and benefits in a contributory system. It is also emphasised that international cooperation on social rights and migration has been of relevance for the development of national legislation. This is especially true for the Peoples´ Pension scheme where the Swedish citizenship as eligibility-criteria has been replaced over time.

Similarly, orientation to certain market segments forced these firms to go abroad {{in order to}} sustain their revenues, further improve their specialization and expand shareholder value. Due to increasing competition in the world market, traditional prerequisites do not necessarily have to lead to success in international bids. In addition to technological excellence, long-lasting experience, quality and cost leadership, securing project financing can {{play a crucial role}} in project bids. International Joint Venture (IJV), led by Siemens, gained an order with an international bid for delivery of two power plants with combined cycle to Oman, due to securing project financing for multinational investor. Project financing, arranged by German state-owned KfW IPEX-Bank, proved to be the turning point in this international tender. Siemens and its Korean partner successfully delivered both power plants in full conformance to investor's requirements. Despite uneasy market conditions and financial markets recovering from financial crises, German and Korean government export credit agencies (ECAs) opened new export opportunity, in order to support their home economies. Whereas jobs in Germany were secured, Siemens as a leading contractor improved its market position within the region of Middle East. At the same time, Sultanate of Oman gained access to highly efficient power sources with low impact on environment.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{and discusses}} {{the development of}} the Swedish government’s role as owner and financier of roads and railroads from the 1930 s until the 2010 s. The influence on {{the development of the}} government’s role from two main theoretical paradigms is discussed and analyzed. These are: a) neoclassical and welfare economics; and b) new institutional economic theory with an organizational focus. The thesis shows that there has been a shift from an institutional view on the organization and financing of the road and railroad systems following the nationalization in the 1930 - 40 s, to a view more based on welfare economics from the 1970 s. Technology, economics and politics are three important factors influencing the development of the transport systems and of the government’s role. In the thesis these factors are covered in a co-evolutionary approach applied for analysis of the historical development. This approach connects to a dynamic view on organizations and firms in institutional theory. Over time there have been shifts in the strength of the factors (technology, economics and politics) influencing the development. There have also been controversies around <b>financing</b> <b>principles</b> and contradictions between different elements in the policies actually pursued over time. One such controversy has been whether to aim for full cost coverage or for marginal cost coverage. The thesis discusses how planning and coordination in the transport infrastructure sector can come about. A centralized public sector planner mode is contrasted towards a private sector spontaneous ordering mode. It is argued that it is difficult for a centralized planner to collect the necessary information and transform it into deepened knowledge in order to coordinate. A decentralized spontaneous ordering mode might though allow for including the necessary knowledge. The thesis illustrates a number of trade-offs that must be taken into consideration when discussing a possible future development for transport infrastructure and the government’s role. The following aspects are discussed: - the balance between public and private as the basic organizing principle; - the balance between government and regions/local governments when it comes to - the geographical division of responsibility; and - the balance between the national and EU levels for strategic transport infrastructure planning and coordination, also in relation to spontaneous coordination and centralized planning. The government has acted reluctantly and pragmatically and gradually developed its ownership role and the general policies in the sector. The government’s emphasis on market failure as its basic assumption has become stronger over time. The thesis brings a deepened understanding of the long-term development of the government’s ownership and policy formation in the transport infrastructure sector in relation to the two theoretical paradigms. This combination of a historical view with the theoretical economic background gives new insights into the past and future of the government’s role for transport infrastructure.

Incubators provide a place for businesses to build their foundations. Business incubators use a combination of physical space, resources and services to facilitate and develop businesses, enhance their progress, break down barriers to success, reduce risks and increase the potential for successful survival of early stage ventures., their progress, break down barriers to success, reduce risks and increase the potential for successful survival of early stage ventures. Business incubators are part of a larger value chain that connects enterprises to a vital support system. Most incubators connect their clients to local service providers (such as lawyers, corporate service providers or accountants) and establish relationships that will last after the firm leaves the incubator. Once an enterprise is ready to leave the incubator environment, it will need space to move into, which in turn, boosts property development and leasing. Because of the enhanced credibility of the business incubation process, landlords would be more confident as a stable, growing business can be a reliable tenant. The empirical object of the study is the Seda NMB ICT Incubator in Port Elizabeth. Eastern Cape. Like any other business an incubator is created to deliver a service or product {{for as long as possible}} and in this process must create value because the ultimate objective of any profit seeking business is to create wealth for its owners with due consideration of all its stakeholders (Brigham & Ehrhardt 2005 : 7 - 12). A preliminary investigation of the Seda NMB ICT Incubator raised the question whether the operation of this incubator meets the performance standards as identified in the international literature. The purpose of this study is therefore to establish whether the performance of the Seda NMB ICT Incubator is in line with generally accepted performance standards. At this stage the standards can be identified as a strategic alliance of the business (vision, mission and strategy), <b>financing</b> <b>principles,</b> management principles and human resource development and growth opportunities. The SEDA NMB ICT Incubator is financed as follows: Partly by the Department of Trade and Industry (the SEDA technology programme) and partly by the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality. It is recommended that public/private partnerships should be formed to ensure the continuity of the Port Elizabeth incubator. A second recommendation is that the SEDA NMB Incubator becomes more focussed in terms of its clients it is serving. At present it is serving a wide variety of ICT clients ranging from website design, graphic art to preparing business plans for ICT businesses. The period of incubation may be too extended as some incubatees have been on the premises for more than five years. It is recommended that the SEDA NMB Incubator pays attention to the length of stay of an incubatee.

The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide knowledge to assess to what extent an alternative or adapted financing scheme for home nursing in Belgium is needed and possible. An important question is whether the <b>financing</b> <b>principles</b> can be based on a patient case-mix. This study is limited to homecare nursing as currently reimbursed at the Belgian federal level through the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI). Home help services, social services, general practitioners, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, as well as community nursing activities such as preventive mother and child care, psychiatric care, midwifery, school health nursing and occupational nursing are beyond the scope of this study. Financing is studied from the provider perspective. Patients accessibility and equity are not addressed. This report describes the financing of home nursing in Belgium as in 4 selected European countries.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of personal loans offered by the cooperatives are Islamic loans that comply with the Sharia guidelines set by SKM.

40|$|Concentrated {{poverty in}} public schools {{continues}} to be a leading determinate of the educational opportunities that minority students receive. Since the effective end of mandatory desegregation, advocates have lacked legal tools to address it. As an alternative, some advocates and scholars have attempted to incorporate the concerns of concentrated poverty and racial segregation into educational litigation under state constitutions, but these efforts have been slow to take hold. Thus, all that has remained for students in poor and minority schools is the hope that school finance litigation could direct sufficient resources to mitigate their plight. This Article offers another solution. Rather than simply importing concepts from federal desegregation into school finance, this Article articulates a unique theory of equal access to middle-income peers that is solidly grounded in state constitutional and school <b>finance</b> <b>principles.</b> In particular, it conceptualizes middle-income students as one of the educational resources that school districts allocate. As such, school <b>finance</b> <b>principles</b> of strategic and equitable distribution of resources apply. This theory is narrower than others and would not directly challenge segregation that exists between districts, but its narrowness is its doctrinal strength. Moreover, an empirical study of district-level practices reveals that conventional wisdom may have underestimated the level of inequality that occurs within districts. The racial inequality in access to middle-income peers within districts is vast and corresponds with dramatic shifts in achievement gaps, a core indicator of constitutional violations in school finance litigation...|$|R
