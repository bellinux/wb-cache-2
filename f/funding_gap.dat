40|$|<b>Funding</b> <b>gaps</b> {{occur when}} for a {{particular}} group of enterprises {{there are not enough}} available funds to finance their growth. Such enterprises are typically young, innovative and technology-oriented startup companies. These companies do not have significant revenues or collaterals; hence they are not suitable for bank financing. On the other hand the information problems decrease their chances to attract investors and also there is high uncertainty involved in these companies. The method of venture capital financing was established to operate in this financing gap and to provide funds for these technology-oriented, young startup enterprises. There is an extensive literature that highlights that venture capitalists are capable and willing to provide financing for these enterprises {{as a result of their}} special expertise and business experience and their sophisticated value creation methods. In this article the authors introduce a real options reasoning in order to give an interpretation of venture capital decision-making method and why venture capital is willing to operate in <b>funding</b> <b>gaps</b> and how it is able to bridge them. With the involvement in the operation of the invested companies venture capitalists create options that increase the value of the firm. Also in option-valuation the higher the uncertainty of the asset is, the higher the value of the option is. That is the reason, why other passive funding forms reject the financing of startup enterprises, while venture capital is willing to provide funds for them. In this article we will describe the problem of <b>funding</b> <b>gaps,</b> than we will introduce real options and their effect on investment decision. In the last part of the article we will demonstrate how real options appear and are created in venture capital financing as a result of its special characteristics and how the real options approach can explain the ability of venture capitalist of bridging <b>funding</b> <b>gaps...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} a defined benefit pension plan {{following}} an immunized fixed income strategy can have lower long-term funding costs than {{if it were to}} follow an equity-based investment strategy. This is true even if stocks outperform bonds over the relevant time horizon. Current liability payments for an underfunded plan raise the required investment hurdle rate needed to maintain a constant funding level. Therefore, an underfunded pension plan betting on equities needs to earn a higher return than an immunized pension plan at a higher funding status to not further fall behind. Since <b>funding</b> <b>gaps</b> for equitybased investment strategies usually arise under unfavorable business conditions, companies may be unable or unwilling to immediately close them. This leads to a persistence of underfunding, thus causing above average returns during a stock market recovery to accrue to an insufficient asset base. Lower long-term funding costs due to higher stock market returns can only be assumed if plan sponsors close arising <b>funding</b> <b>gaps</b> as soon as possible. “My message is simple: Almost every corporate pension fund should be entirely in fixed dollar investments. ...|$|R

[...] The revised plan proposed a $65 million addition of an upper east deck in the first phase, and $40 million addition of a canopy in the second phase. [...] The lengthening of the field to make it CFL compatible and the infrastructure to allow for a temporary increase in seating capacity was postponed to a third phase costing $20–$25 million to be completed by May 1, 2017, pending a commitment by the governments or other parties to fund it and a usage agreement being reached with the Argos. [...] MLSE agreed to pay the city an additional $160,000 annually for as long as phase 3 remains uncompleted to compensate the city for the envisioned parking revenues at Argos games. [...] Leiweke pledged that if both levels of government funded the project [...] "we're obligated to renovate the stadium for the CFL", but if the necessary conditions for phase three are not met by 15 May 2017, MLSE can pull out.
