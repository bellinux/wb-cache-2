5000|$|A <b>guided</b> <b>ray,</b> bound ray, or {{trapped ray}} is a ray in a {{multi-mode}} optical fiber, which is confined by the core. For step index fiber, light entering the fiber will be guided {{if it makes}} an angle with the fiber axis that {{is less than the}} fiber's acceptance angle.|$|E
50|$|The {{core of a}} {{conventional}} optical fiber is a cylinder of glass or plastic that runs along the fiber's length. The core {{is surrounded by a}} medium with a lower index of refraction, typically a cladding of a different glass, or plastic. Light travelling in the core reflects from the core-cladding boundary due to total internal reflection, as long as the angle between the light and the boundary is less than the critical angle. As a result, the fiber transmits all rays that enter the fiber with a sufficiently small angle to the fiber's axis. The limiting angle is called the acceptance angle, and the rays that are confined by the core/cladding boundary are called <b>guided</b> <b>rays.</b>|$|R

40|$|Neutron optics {{involves}} treating neutrons {{similarly to}} beams of light. The problem encountered {{in this paper}} involves determining the possible final conditions of neutrons traveling through neutron guides of various geometries. This problem can be addressed analytically through acceptance diagrams or numerically through ray tracing. An acceptance diagram is a graphical means of displaying the possible final conditions of neutrons, representing their vertical and angular ranges. Ray tracing uses the Monte Carlo Method to numerically plot the possible outcomes by following the paths of many individual neutrons until they reach the exit of the guide. How acceptance diagrams are developed and the mathematical explanation for the paths of individual neutrons within these acceptance diagrams will be explained for both straight guides and simple curved <b>guides.</b> <b>Ray</b> tracing for simple curved guides and guides of more complex geometries will be discussed as well...|$|R

Not one man in a thousand for instance has ever heard of Major Wildman: yet he was the soul of English politics in the most eventful period of this kingdom, and one most interesting to this age, from 1640 to 1688; and seemed more than once to hold the balance which was to decide the permanent form of our government. But he was the leader of an unsuccessful party. Even, comparatively speaking, in our own times, the same mysterious oblivion is sometimes encouraged to creep over personages of great social distinction as well as political importance.|$|R

50|$|The {{magnetosphere}} <b>guides</b> cosmic <b>ray</b> {{and solar}} energetic particles to polar latitudes, while high energy charged particles enter the mesosphere, stratosphere and troposphere. These energetic particles {{at the top}} of the atmosphere shatter atmospheric atoms and molecules, creating harmful lower energy particles that penetrate deep into the atmosphere and create measurable radiation. All aircraft flying above 8 km (26,200 feet) altitude are exposed to these particles. The dose exposure is greater in polar regions than at mid-latitude and equatorial regions. Many commercial aircraft fly over the polar region. When a space weather event causes radiation exposure to exceed the safe level set by aviation authorities, the aircraft's flight path is diverted.|$|R

40|$|Morphogenesis is an {{important}} and complicated process in controlling the final shape of different structures in an organism. To uncover the general molecular mechanism in this developmental process, the male sensory ray of C. elegans is chosen {{as a model for}} study. Nine ram (R̲A̲y M̲orphology abnormal) genes required for normal ray morphogenesis have so far been identified. The tapered rays turn into lumpy rays when any of these genes is mutated. Among these ram genes, ram- 5 encodes a novel transmembrane protein while mab- 7 encodes a novel protein with a hydrophobic region (HR) at its N-terminus. The property of HR of MAB- 7 was shown to be a type II transmembrane domain by domain swapping analysis and protein localization examination. Ectopic expression of mab- 7 in a subset of neurons in the male tail could rescue Mab- 7 phenotype suggesting that mab- 7 is acting non-autonomously during ray morphogenesis. Although the identities of the nine ram genes were known, the details of the mechanism <b>guiding</b> <b>ray</b> morphogenesis have not been worked out. To identify the missing components, three approaches were initiated including an EMS screen, a yeast two-hybrid screen and a target specific RNAi knock down screen. Twelve new ram alleles and newly defined loci were isolated in our EMS screen. GFI- 1 was identified to be a MAB- 7 interacting partner from the yeast two-hybrid screen. Expression pattern and RNAi analyses of this gfi- 1 gene were performed to determine its biological relevance with mab- 7 function. Target specific RNAi treatment had uncovered noah- 2 to be a new ram component. The requirement of this gene in ray morphogenesis was studied by dominant negative approach. Furthermore, ram- 5 was shown to genetically interact with the three RAM collagen-encoding genes, suggesting that the gene product of these genes might associate together during ray morphogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Rays are the {{peripheral}} sensory structures {{developed in the}} tail of the male nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Each of these rays has its own specific morphological and functional identities. Their differentiation is governed by a number of genes which act upon each other to <b>guide</b> the <b>ray</b> morphogenesis. Mutations in these genes result in a transformation of ray identity. One of these genes, mab- 21, has pleiotropic phenotypes when it is mutated. Transformation of ray 6 into ray 4 and subsequent fusion of them is observed. It has been shown that mab- 21 is interacting with a number of evolutionarily conserved molecules. Here I show that analysis of the dynamic expression pattern of mab- 21, and its regulatory promoter elements reveals more information on the regulatory pathway. Furthermore, this study will also facilitate the isolation of components interacting with the gene and the delineation of part of this neuronal identity determination mechanism. This study focuses on the analysis of promoter activity of mab- 21 by producing a series of unidirectional deletion mutations of the promoter sequence. Assay by reporter constructs revealed that expression of mab- 21 in the embryo is dependent on cis-elements confined to - 341 bp to - 316 bp from the transcription start site. Elements encompassed by - 374 to - 316 bp were also shown to be essential for mab- 21 expression in the larval stage. The potential implication of these elements will be discussed.

40|$|Neutron {{guide tubes}} {{are widely used}} to {{transport}} neutron beams over long distances.
