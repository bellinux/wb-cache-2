60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Miss Burton she {{sat down}} in a chair near by and laughed heartily.|$|E
6000|$|... "But yet {{she tried}} {{everything}} she could. And when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> that meeting up at Lord Grex's, {{she was so}} shocked! Do you remember that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{promised not}} to write," [...] he said, [...] "but you might address this to her. She'll know what it is, for <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>about</b> it,--and how {{you would}} all be pleased. And I did try to bring myself to it. Papa,--pray, pray don't want to send me away from you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> why <b>I</b> had come, as respectful and earnest as I could. And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{everything}} <b>about</b> myself, {{and what}} I was making, {{and how that}} all I asked was just to get acquainted with her {{and try to get}} her to like me.|$|R
6000|$|... "She knew {{as much as}} I knew," [...] was the answer, [...] "for I went to {{the island}} on purpose to consult {{with her on the}} subject; and when you confided in me, and I gave you my promise to help you, <b>I</b> also <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks as}} if you didn't know Lance yet; I'm not sure you {{altogether}} know Evelyn. Anyhow, I saw her and stopped the thing. I think she got a bad jolt when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the punt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I left England I did mean something," [...] I answered, [...] "but I {{learned a}} fact {{yesterday}} which has altered my intentions." [...] And then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Hitchcock's revelations, and the reflections {{to which they}} had given rise.|$|E
6000|$|Mr Bloom moved forward, {{raising his}} troubled eyes. Think no more about that. After one. Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. Dunsink time. Fascinating little {{book that is}} of sir Robert Ball's. Parallax. I never exactly understood. There's a priest. Could ask him. Par it's Greek: parallel, parallax. Met him pike hoses she called it till <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the transmigration. O rocks! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I 'ad only let 'er go I should ha' saved {{myself a}} lot o' trouble, {{and the man}} wot {{deserved}} it would ha' got it. Instead o' that <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'er</b> <b>about</b> the music-'all, and arter carrying on like a silly gal o' seventeen and saying she couldn't think of it, she gave way and said she'd go with me to find 'im. I was all right so far as clothes went as it happened. Mrs. Plimmer said once that I {{got more and more}} dressy every time she saw me, and my missis 'ad said the same thing only in a different way. I just took a peep through the wicket and saw that Joe 'ad taken up my dooty, and then we set off.|$|R
6000|$|I gulped. Then I said it {{was nothing}}. Then I {{said it was}} nothing much. Then I said, [...] "Oh, well, it was this way." [...] And, after a few brief remarks <b>about</b> Jimmy Pinkerton, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>about</b> it. And all the while Idiot Freddie stood there gaping, without a word.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor little maid! {{of course}} I had to quench her,' said Felix, {{as far as}} her own day was concerned. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> more <b>about</b> it {{than she had ever}} heard, but then she took me aback by saying Father was happy, and she thought he would like her to be happy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think so," [...] she replied, [...] "nor can {{she think}} so if she {{believes}} {{half of what}} I have told her about you since. She knows how you saved the boy's life. I told her that in the old Lair because she had some harsh memories of you there; {{and it was at}} the Cuttle Well that <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the glove." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense! my dear: {{those are}} white pebbles, not pearls; and, if you examine them, {{you will find}} that those bracelets are the ones you gave Fancy as a reward for so well remembering the facts <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> coral," [...] said the uncle, who had turned Lorelei round and round, pinched her cheek, felt her hair, and {{examined}} her frock through the glasses which nothing escaped.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{mean to do}} it, I truly didn't! I thought I'd just 'give her a hint,' as you say. She {{looked all}} right, and laughed when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> being a bore, and I thought she liked it. If she was a man, I'd thrash her for making Polly cry;" [...] and Toady shook his fist at Aunt Kipp's umbrella, which was an immense relief to his perturbed spirit.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you’re wrong," [...] {{said the}} mate. [...] "A lot {{you know about}} girls. It wasn’t your old clothes, and it wasn’t all your bad {{behaviour}} to her since she’s been aboard. You may as well know first as last. She wouldn’t {{have nothing to do}} with me at first, so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>about</b> Mary Jones." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thanks to {{that lie}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> ships [...] And {{that about the}} {{herdsman}} lying sick, [...] We shall be too much thronged with souls to-morrow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Kennedy, {{this is my}} granddaughter, Frances Newbury. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you <b>about</b> <b>her</b> and her ambitions last night. You see, Frances, we {{have talked}} you over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not one. She don't care two sous for us or our affairs. I {{thought she}} might {{like to know what}} sort of people we were, so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Papa's sudden death, Uncle John, and you, and Ned; but in the midst of it she said, in her quiet way, 'You are getting too confidential, my dear. It is not best to talk too freely of one's affairs to strangers. Let us speak of {{something}} else.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Abner threw {{a glance}} {{over the water}} as if his soul were yearning for the fancied {{possibilities}} of Thompsontown. 'Oh, it's all right enough, so far as she counts,' said he. 'I went straight at it, and put the whole thing afore her. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> {{the house and the}} two parts to it and what they was for, and she said that was charmin'. And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the king conch-shell and the gilded idol, and she said she thought either one of them would be jes lovely, and nothin', she thought, could be better on mantelpieces than gilded idols and king conch-shells. And everything else was jes as slick and smooth as if she was slidin' off the stocks. She's good-lookin' enough, Sam, but she ain't got no mind, and I didn't fix up that house, and bother myself {{year in and year out}} a-gettin' it all right, to take it and give it to a woman what's got no mind. She'd be jes as well satisfied to see me a-settin' up on the mantelpiece as if the gilded idol or the king conch-shell was there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{looked at}} that garden," [...] Euphrasia went on, [...] "and cried out. I didn't callate she was like that. And the first thing I knew I was talking about your mother, and I'd forgot who I was talking to. She wahn't like a stranger--it was just as if I'd known her always. I haven't {{understood}} it yet. And after a while <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> that verse, {{and she wanted to}} see it--the verse about the skylark, you know--" ...|$|E
60|$|Now, I {{could not}} {{understand}} this, and I was so anxious for the happiness of my own pet that it caused me some uneasiness and set me thinking often. At length, feeling sure that Ada suppressed this something from me lest it should make me unhappy too, it came into my head {{that she was a}} little grieved--for me--by what <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Bleak House.|$|R
6000|$|MY DEAR MOTHER,--I {{have told}} Livy all about Annie's {{beautiful}} house, and about Sam and Charley, and about Charley's ingenious manufactures and his strong manhood and good promise, and how glad I am {{that he and}} Annie married. And <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Annie's excellent house-keeping, also about the great Bacon conflict; (<b>I</b> <b>told</b> you it was a hundred to one that neither Livy nor the European powers had heard of that desolating struggle.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Famously; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>about</b> everything, and how {{the affair}} is to be really quiet, which she had never believed. She could hardly believe my word, when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{there was to be}} {{absolutely}} no one but ourselves and Mary Ross. She supposed it was for your sake, and I did not tell her it was for their own. It really was providential that the Kilcoran folk disgusted my father with grand weddings, for Philip never could endure one.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} if you'd only {{cultivate}} it," [...] said Anne cheeringly. [...] "I've just thought of a plan, Diana. Let you and me have a story club all our own and write stories for practice. I'll help you along until you can do them by yourself. You ought to cultivate your imagination, you know. Miss Stacy says so. Only we must take the right way. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the Haunted Wood, but she said we went the wrong way about it in that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know you}} did. You can't escape your responsibility. Well, I felt like--like a gambler, as though I were staking {{everything}} on a throw. And, after I began, as if I were playing on some rare instrument. She lay there, listening, without uttering a word, but somehow {{she seemed to}} be interpreting them for me, giving them a meaning and a beauty I hadn't imagined. Another time <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Silliston, and how this little community for over {{a century and a half}} had tried to keep its standard flying, to carry on the work begun by old Andrew, and I thought of those lines, ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} sitting {{in one of}} the recesses {{at the end of the}} big saloon with Mrs. Redmondson, one of those sharp-minded, beautiful rich women one meets so often in London, who seem to have done nothing and to be capable of everything, and we watched the crowd--uniforms and splendours were streaming in from a State ball--and exchanged information. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the politicians and intellectuals, and she told me about the aristocrats, and we sharpened our wit on them and counted the percentage of beautiful people among the latter, and wondered if the general effect of tallness was or was not an illusion.|$|E
60|$|From {{this the}} talk {{branched}} into other subjects, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> much <b>about</b> my lonely and wandering existence; she, for her part, giving ear and saying little. Although we spoke very naturally, and latterly on topics {{that might seem}} indifferent, we were both sweetly agitated. Too soon {{it was time for}} her to go; and we separated, as if by mutual consent, without shaking hands, for both knew that, between us, it was no idle ceremony.|$|R
6000|$|After {{this for}} a while we were silent, for indeed I could not speak. Then we talked on as we could do well enough, since there was no one on my left where the board ended, and on Blanche's right was a fat old lord who seemed to be deaf and {{occupied}} himself in drinking more than he should have done. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> much <b>about</b> myself, also what my mother had said to me {{on the day of the}} Burning, and of how she had prophesied that I should be a wanderer, words at which Blanche sighed and answered: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{hesitate}} any longer," [...] Mr. Atherton said, [...] "I shall {{go in and}} fetch Marion out. <b>I</b> {{have not}} <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> my plan yet, for in fact we had other things to talk about; but when I tell her, and she adds her voice to ours, I am sure {{you will not be}} able to refuse any longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{it seems}} she noticed him {{going to church}} in all his rags, and Mr. Cope told her who he was; so Miss Jane came and asked me all about him, and I told her what a fine scholar he is, and how shamefully the farmer and Boldre treat him, and how good he was to Alfred about the ointment, and how steady he is. And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> the boys {{dressing}} him up yesterday, and how he wouldn't take a gift. She listened just {{as if it was}} a story, and she ran away to her grandmamma, and presently came back to say that the boy was to come up to-morrow after his work, for Lady Jane to speak to him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She said," [...] Isobel continued, looking {{steadily}} {{in front of}} her, [...] "that you were all three very poor indeed, and that I {{had no right to}} come and live with you, and make you poorer still, when I had a home offered me elsewhere. She said that I should disturb your whole life, that you would have to give up many things which were a pleasure to you, and you {{would not be able to}} succeed so well with your work, as you would have to write altogether for money. And she said that I should be grown up soon, and ought to live where there are women; and when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> Mrs. Burdett she laughed unpleasantly, and said that she did not count at all. And that is why--she wants me--to go there!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went to a}} shack in Aguas Frescas where {{a mighty}} wise girl named Timotea Carrizo lived with her mother. The girl was just about as nice as you ever saw. In the States {{she would have been}} called a brunette; but she was better than a brunette--I should say she was what you might term an écru shade. I knew her pretty well. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about</b> my friend Wainwright. She gave me a double handful of bark--calisaya, I think it was--and some more herbs that I was to mix with it, and told me what to do. I was to make tea of it and give it to him, and keep him from rum for a certain time. And for two weeks I did it. You know, I liked Wainwright. Both of us was broke; but Timotea sent us goat-meat and plantains and tortillas every day; and at last I got the curse of drink lifted from Clifford Wainwright. He lost his taste for it. And in the cool of the evening him and me would sit on the roof of Timotea's mother's hut, eating {{harmless}} truck like coffee and rice and stewed crabs, and playing the accordion.|$|E
60|$|I was {{astonished}} to find that she had taken the fantastic little tale invented to amuse her as truth; but the poor babe had never read books or heard stories, and the fairy tale had been {{too much for her}} starved little imagination. I remember that once on another occasion <b>I</b> <b>told</b> a pathetic story of a little child, lost in a great wilderness, to a girl about Anita's age, and just as unaccustomed to this kind of mental fare. Next morning her mother informed me that my little listener had spent half the night sobbing and begging to be allowed to go and look for that lost child <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
5000|$|It is {{her first}} album of {{original}} songs in two decades and she credits a chance meeting with Joni Mitchell in Los Angeles for this. [...] "She played me her playlist of all the songs she would really dig if she was stranded on a desert island and <b>told</b> me <b>I</b> had to get mine together. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> my ideas <b>about</b> what I wanted to do next {{and she told me}} to follow them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mistress Martin {{did not say}} no {{word about}} it afterwards. She came up on deck a few times, and asked me more about the captain, and how he looked, {{and what he was}} doing when he got his wound. And of course <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all <b>about</b> it, full and particular, and how he had made every one else lie down, and stood there at the tiller as we went under the stern of the Spaniard, and that none of us knew he was hit until it was all over; and how we had {{peppered}} them with our four carronades, and all about it. But mostly she stopped down below till we hauled our wind and headed up the Zuider Zee towards Enkhuizen." ...|$|R
