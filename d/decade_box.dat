25|$|A {{resistance}} <b>decade</b> <b>box</b> or resistor substitution box is a unit containing resistors of many values, {{with one}} or more mechanical switches which allow any one of various discrete resistances offered by the box to be dialed in. Usually the resistance is accurate to high precision, ranging from laboratory/calibration grade accuracy of 20 parts per million, to field grade at 1%. Inexpensive boxes with lesser accuracy are also available. All types offer a convenient way of selecting and quickly changing a resistance in laboratory, experimental and development work without needing to attach resistors one by one, or even stock each value. The range of resistance provided, the maximum resolution, and the accuracy characterize the box. For example, one box offers resistances from 0 to 100 megohms, maximum resolution 0.1 ohm, accuracy 0.1%.|$|E

50|$|In {{prototyping}} {{of electronic}} circuits, a <b>decade</b> <b>box</b> {{is a type}} of test equipment {{that can be used to}} substitute the interchanging of different values of certain passive components with a single variable output. Decade boxes are made for resistance, capacitance, and inductance, the values of which can be increased incrementally by way of switching the points of contact for the input and output throughout a series of the respective components. The interface for these devices will usually consist of dials or adjustable tape counters, and are operated in-circuit and without any external power source.|$|E

This work describes a novel resistance measurement method valid {{for a wide}} range of resistance values up to 100 GΩ at a low powered, small sized, digitally controlled and wireless communicated device. The analog and digital circuits of the design are described, analysing the main error sources affecting the accuracy. Accuracy and extended uncertainty are obtained for a pattern <b>decade</b> <b>box,</b> showing a maximum of 1 % accuracy for temperatures below 30 ∘ C in the range from 1 MΩ to 100 GΩ. Thermal analysis showed stability up to 50 ∘ C for values below 10 GΩ and systematic deviations for higher values. Power supply V i applied to the measurement probes is also analysed, showing no differences in case of the pattern <b>decade</b> <b>box,</b> except for resistance values above 10 GΩ and temperatures above 35 ∘ C. To evaluate the circuit behaviour under fiber materials, an 11 -day drying process in timber from four species (Oregon pine-Pseudotsuga menziesii, cedar-Cedrus atlantica, ash-Fraxinus excelsior, chestnut-Castanea sativa) was monitored. Results show that the circuit, as expected, provides different resistance values (they need individual conversion curves) for different species and the same ambient conditions. Additionally, it was found that, contrary to the <b>decade</b> <b>box</b> analysis, V i affects the resistance value due to material properties.
