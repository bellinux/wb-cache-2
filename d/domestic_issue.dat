5|$|Nixon {{retained}} Chotiner as {{a consultant}} to his first congressional campaign in 1946. In an era when the perceived threat of communism was a major <b>domestic</b> <b>issue,</b> Chotiner advised the future president to link his liberal opponent, Representative Jerry Voorhis, to a political organization which was believed to be communist-dominated. Nixon was elected, and hired Chotiner to run his 1950 Senate campaign against Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas. Chotiner used a similar strategy in that campaign, stressing Douglas' liberal voting record and printing the accusations on pink paper to hint at communist sympathy. Congressman Nixon easily defeated Douglas, and Chotiner next managed Nixon's 1952 vice presidential campaign and counseled Nixon through allegations of antisemitism and revelations that there were privately run funds to pay Nixon's political expenses—revelations that the candidate decisively overcame with his televised Checkers speech.|$|E
25|$|An {{attack on}} the Empire, however, {{did not come to}} pass, and the {{alliance}} concluded at Tilsit was dissolved by the French invasion of Russia in 1812. Following Napoleon's defeat by the Great Powers in 1815, representatives of the victors met at the Congress of Vienna, but failed to take any action relating to the territorial integrity of the decaying Ottoman Empire. This omission, together with the exclusion of the Sultan from the Holy Alliance, was interpreted by many as supportive of the position that the Eastern Question was a Russian <b>domestic</b> <b>issue</b> that did not concern any other European nations.|$|E

The entanglement of the Irish famine with the repeal of the Corn Laws, she says, was a key misfortune for Ireland. The potato failure was eclipsed by the <b>domestic</b> <b>issue</b> of Corn Law repeal. The Irish famine, she writes, [...] "slipped into the background." ...|$|E

In 1925, the Reichsgericht had declared the expropriation of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha from July 1919 to be unconstitutional and repealed it. In reaction, draft bills had been tabled in the Reichstag by Communists (requesting complete expropriation without compensation) and others (giving the Länder the right to finally settle this issue with the noble houses and barring recourse to the courts).|$|E

In 1786, he instituted a sinking fund so that £1,000,000 a year was added to a fund so that it could accumulate interest; eventually, the money in the fund was to be used to pay off the national debt. By 1792 the debt had fallen to £170 million.|$|E
