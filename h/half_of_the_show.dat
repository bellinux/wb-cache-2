At one performance though, Garfield insisted Herb Jeffries, who was light-skinned, should wear make-up. Ellington objected in the interval, and compared Jeffries to Al Jolson.

500|$|Critics {{have enjoyed}} the series' story and writing. Santos enjoyed how Steins;Gate misleads the viewer by {{spending}} {{the first half}} of the series on comedy before turning into a thriller for the second half, and how the finale revisits the events of the first episode, making for a [...] "rock-solid climax". Rebecca Silverman at Anime News Network called the pacing of the first half uneven, with exciting scientific discoveries coupled with less interesting sequences about daily life in the laboratory and maid café visits, but found the second <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> to be a step up; she enjoyed the added urgency, and how the characters were given development and how the viewer was given insight into their motivations from {{the first half of}} the series. Similarly, Aiden Foote at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews said that the first half, while entertaining, is lacking in direction. Eisenbeis noted the rules for how time travel works as well defined, which he called among the hardest things to do when writing time travel fiction. Pierce Drew at The Fandom Post enjoyed the story and characters, but noted that Luka adds very little to the story.|$|E

500|$|Hill {{has participated}} in various {{television}} productions, such as Survival of the Fittest, which she won four seasons in a row, from 1980 to 1984; she beat Olympic athletes at rope climbing and cross-country running. It was rock climbing legend and personal hero Beverly Johnson who first asked Hill to compete. The inaugural year of the competition, the first prize for {{the men in the}} competition was US$15,000 and for the women, US$5,000. Angered, Hill asked for parity, arguing that since the women were competing in four events and the men six, the women should at least be awarded $10,000. She proposed a boycott to the other female competitors, negotiating a deal with the producer that the prize money would be raised the next year and she could compete again. In her autobiography, Hill writes that she heard a rumor that NBC canceled the women's <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> because the producers could not find anyone to beat her. She [...] "became increasingly aware of how few women were pushing the limits of climbing and endurance like I was, and of how my passion had led me very much into a man's world". During the early 1980s Hill also appeared on The Guinness Game, That's Incredible!, and Ripley's Believe it or Not. She describes her feat of climbing over a hot-air balloon at 6,000 feet for That's Incredible! as [...] "perhaps the most ridiculous stunt I ever did". Despite the earlier television appearances Hill attributes her fame to a 1982 poster for the company Patagonia that showed a photograph of her climbing.|$|E

During a statement before the show, Beyoncé revealed, [...] "We have designed an elegant and beautiful stage and we will have new costumes that are being designed especially for this show." [...] Beyoncé is accompanied by an orchestra and her 18-member all-female band on stage [...] "whose satin interpretations pump lush over pomp" [...] according to Mike Ragogna of The Huffington Post. She is also backed by several dancers during the performances of several songs and also appears alone during some performances. The choreography for the show was developed by Beyoncé's collaborator Frank Jr. Gatson. The set list included performances of over thirty songs, both from Beyoncé's solo career and as part of the girl group Destiny's Child. During the show, one major costume change was made. Beyoncé first appeared in beaded Jean Paul Gaultier couture and then in a cape-like jacket for the first <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> Both pieces were worn on top of a figure-flaunting grey bodysuit. For the second part, Beyoncé traded the bodysuit for a black sequined, bathing suit-like number. Several costumes for the stage during the show were also designed by Beyoncé's mother Tina Knowles, who was her designer for many years. Arseniuk of Las Vegas Weekly praised the costumes of the show, saying that Beyoncé [...] "sparkled from beginning to end". She noted that the first costume [...] "left little to the imagination" [...] while the second one [...] "left no curve unnoticed".|$|E
