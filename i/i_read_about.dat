500|$|Brandon Teena was a trans {{man who was}} gang {{raped and}} murdered by two male acquaintances in December 1993, when he was 21. Kimberly Peirce, {{at the time a}} Columbia University film student, became {{interested}} in the case after reading a 1994 Village Voice article by Donna Minkowitz. Peirce became engrossed in Brandon's life and death; she said, [...] "the minute <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> Brandon, I fell in love. With the intensity of his desire to turn himself into a boy, {{the fact that he did}} it with no role models. The leap of imagination that this person took was completely overwhelming to me." [...] The sensationalist news coverage of the case prolonged her interest. Peirce said she looked beyond the brutality of the case and instead viewed the positive aspects of Brandon's life as part of what eventually causes his death. [...] She admired Brandon's audacity, ability to solve complicated problems, and what she perceived as the sense of fantasy invoked by his personality.|$|E
500|$|Although the European films {{allowed him}} to travel {{and gave him a}} {{constant}} source of income, he received bigger fees from his less-frequent engagements in US films, which he continued to appear in, joking that he [...] "knew the fat cheques in the pipe-line were endless". One of the bigger fees came with Gene Kelly's 1967 film A Guide for the Married Man; he was disappointed by Kelly's direction, later saying [...] "I found him a very prudish director, not as imaginative or experimental as I would have liked". Terry-Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene, Jayne Mansfield, commenting that [...] "I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered when <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> the gruesome car accident that killed her". An actress he had difficulties in working with was Doris Day: in the 1968 film Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?, which was produced by her husband Martin Melcher. Day would instruct Terry-Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would [...] "listen... politely, then do it my own way, as if the conversation had never taken place"). She would also launch into improvisations while filming; director Hy Averback would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry-Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print. The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called [...] "limp", and Christopher Young described as [...] "such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy".|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} were written by Manson as she {{included}} and filtered some of her bandmates' ideas on songwriting. [...] "It was a very do-it-yourself, homemade thing {{when it comes down}} to it", Erikson explained; [...] "We all pitch in. Shirley had just as many comments on the guitar parts or the sound of the guitars as anybody else, and likewise, if we don't like a lyric, we say it right away." [...] Many songs have a more optimistic view in life, inspired by Manson overcoming a desire to quit music after the death of her mother and realizing how important her work is to her. Darker themes still appear as Manson described herself as [...] "enthusiastic and passionate, but I do see death marching toward me." [...] "Blood for Poppies" [...] came [...] "from a lot of things", Manson said; [...] "It's really an analogy for a story <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> Afghanistan and the opium wars over there ... it's from a few stories, one about a platoon of soldiers in Afghanistan and the other about the opium wars. I use that as a backdrop for a story about maintaining sanity in an out-of-control place." [...] " [...] remaining sane, when faced with insanity", she added. [...] "I Hate Love" [...] criticized [...] "the commercialized idea of love and what pain that puts us through" [...] along with [...] "knowing that there will be no more torture in your life than really, truly loving somebody who doesn't love you back." [...] Manson also incorporated some self-confidence and knowledge of her personality achieved during acting classes, in which she accepted that [...] "was never going to be the cheerleader or the beautiful, conventional girl who fits in everywhere." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I have <b>read</b> <b>about</b> him," [...] said Rollo. [...] "I found a {{book about}} him in a {{steamboat}} that we came in, and <b>I</b> <b>read</b> all <b>about</b> his coming to Holland." ...|$|R

2500|$|Meir {{was one of}} 24 signatories (including two women) of the Israeli Declaration of Independence on May 14, 1948. She later recalled, [...] "After I signed, I cried. When I studied American {{history as}} a schoolgirl and <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> those who signed the U.S. Declaration of Independence, I couldn't imagine these were real people doing {{something}} real. And there I was sitting down and signing a declaration of establishment." [...] Israel was attacked the next day by the joint armies of neighboring countries in what became the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the war, Israel stopped the combined Arab assault, and then it launched a series of military offensives to defeat the invading Arab armies and to end the war.|$|E
2500|$|Even though men {{surrounded}} Gandhi {{during her}} upbringing, {{she still had}} a female role model as a child. Several books on Gandhi mention her interest in Joan of Arc. In her own accounts through her letters she wrote to her friend Dorothy Norman, in 1952 she wrote: [...] "At about eight or nine I was taken to France; Jeanne d'Arc became a great heroine of mine. She {{was one of the}} first people <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> with enthusiasm." [...] Another historian recounts Indira's comparison of herself to Joan of Arc: [...] "Indira developed a fascination for Joan of Arc, telling her aunt, 'Someday I am going to lead my people to freedom just as Joan of Arc did! Gandhi's linking of herself to Joan of Arc presents a nice model for historians to assess Gandhi. As one writer said: [...] "The Indian people were her children; members of her family were the only people capable of leading them." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{she became}} an adult, her mother {{introduced}} her {{to a series of}} eligible young men, but she insisted on Nhu. He was fourteen years older and referred to her as [...] "little niece" [...] in accordance with Vietnamese custom. In accordance with Vietnamese tradition, they were married three years after being betrothed in 1940. In May 1943, aged 18, she married Nhu, and converted from Mahayana Buddhism to Roman Catholicism, her husband's religion. Madame Nhu later admitted she married Nhu as a way of getting away from her family, saying [...] "I never had a sweeping love. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> such things in books, but I do not believe that they really existed. Or perhaps only for a very few people". After an uprising by the Viet Minh in August 1945, her brother-in-law, Ngô Đình Khôi, the eldest of the Ngô brothers, was buried alive, [...] and Nhu and another brother, Ngô Đình Cẩn, were forced to flee.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to do an episode about Anne Frank, Murphy said, [...] "We have a great writing staff but I will take credit for that. One of the things we've done on the show is we take historical figures – {{last year was the}} Black Dahlia and this year is Anne Frank. The Black Dahlia particularly was a case that was never solved so we solved that case in our way. The Anne Frank thing was always interesting to me because after the war, much like the Anastasia case, there were many women who came forward after that diary and said, 'Well I'm the real Anne Frank,' and they were struck down. Many of them were found to be mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, so <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> those cases. Before we even wrote one word of it, I thought there was sort of only one actress I was interested in playing Anne Frank and that was Franka. So I brought her in and said, 'I'm gonna write this for you and would you do it.' And we had no script because we were very early on in the season. She loved the story and I sorta swore her to secrecy and God bless her heart she had like five months without telling anybody. I love how it came together." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I think <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> him in {{an account}} of the island,' said Leonard, with a moment's awakened intelligence; 'was he not the L. of the Cabal, the persecutor in [...] "Old Mortality?"' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Because {{they are}} better than Tom Tringle. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> somewhere <b>about</b> there being seven houses of the Devil, each one being lower and worse than the other. Tom would be the lowest,--the lowest,--the lowest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So you are {{the young}} men <b>I</b> have <b>read</b> <b>about</b> in the papers. Well, of course, when one is young, one is rather romantic. Do you know what I always say to young people?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It was? Do {{you mean}} it isn't still? I thought Elsa had made such a {{tremendous}} hit. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> it when I was over in London. It was even {{in one of the}} English papers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you are, are you? <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> that in American history!... But honestly, Mr. Wrenn, I {{do believe}} {{you care for}} tramps and things--not like that Teddem or Mr. Duncan--they always want to just stay in town--or even Tom, though he's an old dear." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{shivered and}} her eyes dilated. [...] "You mean it as a joke. But it's no joke.... <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>about</b> your comrade--that poor Red Payson!" ...

6000|$|L. Yes; and <b>I</b> like <b>reading</b> <b>about</b> them too, Lucilla; as <b>I</b> like <b>reading</b> other grand poetry. But, surely, {{we ought}} both {{to do more}} than like it?

6000|$|... "Oh! No, I {{only mean}} what <b>I</b> have <b>read</b> <b>about.</b> It always puts me {{in mind of}} the country that Emily and her father {{travelled}} through, in The Mysteries of Udolpho. But you never <b>read</b> novels, <b>I</b> dare say?" ...|$|R
60|$|They all agreed, {{and whispered}} and jibbered with joy. But my heart broke; for <b>I</b> had <b>read</b> <b>about</b> that man, and {{knew what it}} would be to have him upon my track, with his superhuman {{penetration}} and tireless energies.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} read any but this,' said Phyllis.

6000|$|The {{silence that}} hung over this little {{exchange}} was growing {{more and more}} dense. Luckless Miss M.!

6000|$|... "Not exactly. You'd have {{to think}} up {{different}} ways of punishment to suit the person. You wouldn't punish each other--you'd punish YOURSELVES. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> all <b>about</b> such a club in a story-book. You try it {{and see how it}} works." ...|$|R
