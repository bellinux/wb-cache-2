The purposes are to substantiate and to develop the set in manners and means for control over dust in the flow schemes of opencast collieries {{on the basis of}} study of dust-making mechanisms during the operation of Mine-Transport Equipment (MTE). The indicator of specific energy expenses for the dust-making has been substantiated; the coal classification of opencast collieries according to the dust-making ability has been developed. The values of specific energy expenses for the dust-making of coals of opencast collieries have been ascertained. The optimization criterion of relation between the components of dust-binders - the number of paramagnetic centres has been brought out. The dependences of rate of dust emission by the non-organized sources on the MTE characteristics, on the mechanical-and-physical properties of rocks and on the conditions characterizing the dust propagation have been ascertained. The Universin-L, -B, -S substances, the emulsions on their basis, the set of dedusting means at the bucket-wheel excavating machines, at the take-up bunkers at the Concentrating Factories, the UPA plant for the drilling machines, the APP assembly for the <b>dust</b> <b>catching,</b> the SPA watering assembly have been developed and have been introduced to control over dust on the roadsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Air {{pollution}} {{is a serious}} health problem throughout the world, exacerbating {{a wide range of}} respiratory and vascular illnesses in urban areas. The mass artificial plantation is very helpful to absorb dust and reduce pollution for conservation of the urban environment. The foliar surface of plants is an important receptor of atmospheric pollutants. Therefore, selection of suitable plant species for urban environment is very important. Methods: The dust-retaining capability of urban trees in Guangzhou was determined at four different types of urban area, and the morphological traits of their leaves such as wax, cuticle, stomata, and trichomes were observed under a scanning electron microscope. Results: It was determined that the dust-retaining capability of any given tree species is significantly different in the same place. Of the four studied tree species in the industrial area (IA) and commercial/traffic areas (CTA) type urban areas, the highest amounts of dust removed by Mangifera indica Linn was 12. 723 and 1. 482  g/m 2, respectively. However, in contrast, the equivalent maxima for Bauhinia blakeana is only 2. 682  g/m 2 and 0. 720  g/m 2, respectively. Different plant species have different leaf morphology. The leaf of M. indica has deep grooves and high stomata density which are in favor of dust-retained, and thus, their dust-retained capability is stronger, while B. blakeana has the cells and epicuticular wax with its stomata arranging regularly, resulting in poor <b>dust</b> <b>catching</b> capability. Leaf size was also shown to be related to dust capture for the four studied tree species. Conclusions: The dust removal capacity of individual tree species should be taken into account in the management of greening plantation in and around an urban area. It was also shown that temporal variation in dust accumulation occurred over the 28 -day observation period and this was discussed. Furthermore, spatial contrasts in dust accumulation were evidenced by the data. This reflected the differing pollution loadings of the four urban-type areas. The highest amount of dust accumulation was associated with the industrial area in which shipyard and steelworks occurred whilst the lowest dust accumulation was associated with the grounds of the University which was the control area. © 2012 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
