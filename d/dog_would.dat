5|$|A ^ Rob {{was awarded}} the Dickin Medal in 1945 for taking part in more than 20 {{parachute}} drops and for his involvement in operations behind enemy lines in Italy and North Africa during the Second World War. There is evidence that his record is a hoax concocted by the training officer at 2nd SAS at the time so that the <b>dog</b> <b>would</b> remain with the regiment.|$|E
5|$|Frank Williams was recaptured and {{was sent}} to a new camp without news of Judy's survival. However, stories began being told of a dog helping {{drowning}} men reach pieces of debris on which to hold, and others recalled how the <b>dog</b> <b>would</b> bring them flotsam to keep them afloat. The <b>dog</b> <b>would</b> also allow men to hold onto her back while swimming them to safety. She had been found in the water by other survivors of the sinking, and once again hidden from the Japanese. Upon arrival at a dock, she was found by Les Searle who tried to smuggle her onto a truck with him. However, she was discovered by a Japanese Captain who threatened to kill her – whose order was countermanded by the newly arrived former Commander of the Medan camp and she was allowed to travel with Searle onto the new camp.|$|E
25|$|The English Springer Spaniel is a {{medium-sized}} compact dog. Its coat is moderately long with feathering on {{the legs and}} tail. It is a well proportioned, balanced dog with a gentle expression and a friendly wagging tail. This breed represents perhaps the greatest divergence between working and show lines of any breed of dog. A field-bred dog and a show-bred dog appear to be different breeds, but are registered together. In fact, the gene pools are almost completely segregated and have been for at least 70 years. A field-bred <b>dog</b> <b>would</b> not be competitive in a modern dog show, while a show <b>dog</b> <b>would</b> not have the speed or stamina to succeed in a field trial.|$|E

25|$|In October 2013 the DFCE {{received}} a Newfoundland dog {{to serve as}} both a mascot and a rehabilitation animal for detainees. At this time, it was intended that the <b>dog</b> <b>would</b> {{be the first in}} a line of Newfoundlands to perform these roles.|$|E

25|$|The Gurt Dog ("Great Dog") of Somerset is {{an example}} of a benevolent dog.

25|$|On December 3, 2015, Francesa and Russo {{had their}} radio shows {{simulcast}} on both WFAN and SiriusXM Satellite Radio for a commercial-free 40 minutes. During the simulcast, they announced that Mike and the Mad <b>Dog</b> <b>would</b> reunite for a one-time-only fundraising show at Radio City Music Hall on March 30, 2016.

25|$|The {{original}} idea {{was for a}} dog to carry a bomb strapped to its body, and reach a specific static target. The <b>dog</b> <b>would</b> then release the bomb by pulling with its teeth a self-releasing belt {{and return to the}} operator. The bomb could then be detonated either by a timer or remote control, though the latter was too rare and expensive at the time to be used. A group of dogs practiced this for six months, but the reports show that no dogs could master the task. They performed well on a single target but became confused after the target or location was changed and often returned to the operator with the bomb unreleased, which in a live situation would have killed both the dog and the operator.|$|E
25|$|Cooking with Dogs {{creator and}} {{producer}} conceived {{of the idea}} for the show upon his return to Tokyo from Los Angeles, where he had graduated from film school and worked in film and television. Interested in continuing in the industry, but unable to find success on his own and lacking a significant budget, the producer approached Chef (whose identity is also undisclosed for privacy reasons) {{with the idea of a}} cooking show. Chef was known to the producer as a good cook, and agreed to the show concept: she would cook one dish while her toy poodle Francis would be dubbed to narrate. Francis, who lives with Chef, was included to make Chef feel more comfortable and at ease on camera, as she had no background with television. Additionally, the producer felt that including a cute <b>dog</b> <b>would</b> make the series stand out to viewers. The decision for Francis to narrate in Japanese-accented English was due to the producer's desire to promote Japanese culture through English-accessible content and widen the show's appeal. The show's producer does the voice acting for Francis.|$|E

5000|$|From these experiments, it {{was thought}} that there was to be only one cure for helplessness. In Seligman's hypothesis, the dogs do not try to escape because they expect that nothing they do will stop the shock. To change this expectation, experimenters {{physically}} picked up the dogs and moved their legs, replicating the actions the <b>dogs</b> <b>would</b> need to take in order to escape from the electrified grid. This had to be done at least twice before the <b>dogs</b> <b>would</b> start willfully jumping over the barrier on their own. In contrast, threats, rewards, and observed demonstrations had no effect on the [...] "helpless" [...] Group 3 dogs.|$|R
25|$|In the United States {{there are}} many laws that allow the {{confiscation}} of cash and other assets from the bearer if there is suspicion that the money came from an illegal activity. Because {{a significant amount of}} U.S. currency contains traces of cocaine and other illegal drugs, {{it is not uncommon for}} innocent people searched at airports or stopped for traffic violations to have cash in their possession sniffed by dogs for drugs and then have the cash seized because the dog smelled drugs on the money. It is then up to the owner of the money to prove where the cash came from at his own expense. Many people simply forfeit the money. In 1994, the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, held in the case of UNITED STATES of America v. U.S. CURRENCY, $30,060.00 (39 F.3d 1039 63 USLW 2351, No. 92-55919) that the widespread presence of illegal substances on paper currency in the Los Angeles area created a situation where the reaction of a drug-sniffing <b>dog</b> <b>would</b> not create probable cause for civil forfeiture.|$|E
25|$|The Chronicon Lethrense inserts {{the common}} folktale {{of the dog}} king after Helgi's death. In this account King Hākun of Sweden sent a small dog to the Danes to take as their king but warned that whoever told him {{of the death of}} the <b>dog</b> <b>would</b> lose his life. One day, when larger dogs are fighting, the small dog sprang to the floor among them and was torn to death. Then Lǣ, the giant of Lǣsø̄ (Læsø), gave some advice on the matter to his {{herdsman}} Snow. (Lǣ is a Danish form of Hlér, a common name for Ægir who is Snow's great-granduncle in the Norse tradition). Snow went to Hākun's court and by riddling talk eventually got the king himself to say that the dog was dead. Snow was then appointed king of Denmark in place of the dog. Snow was a vicious, oppressive, and dishonest king. Snow sent his servant named Roth 'Red', whom he disliked, to the giant Lǣ to ask about how Snow will die, intending that Lǣ would kill Roth who would be unable to pass his tests. Roth passed and Lǣ gave Roth two gloves to take to Snow in answer. Snow put them on in an assembly and lice suddenly attacked him and ate him to death. Thereupon Helgi's son Hrólf was made king.|$|E
25|$|He {{reached the}} Easter Cup final at Shelbourne {{and won the}} Spring Cup final at Harold's Cross Stadium and National Cup final at Shelbourne before {{travelling}} to England for the first time. In a solo trial prior to the 1929 English Greyhound Derby on 25 July, Mick broke the track record, reducing his odds from an initial 25–1 to becoming the 4–7 favorite to win {{by the time of}} the final, despite still being new off the board from Ireland. He was housed at the kennels of Paddy McEllistrim for the duration of the Derby. In the first round, Mick pulled away down the back straight, beating Captured Half by eight lengths and setting a time of 29.82, a new world record over that length. Father Browne sold Mick for £800, plus any prize money that the <b>dog</b> <b>would</b> win on the night, which at the time was more than the cost of buying a house in nearby Shepherd's Bush. By 8:45pm, when the final took place, some 40,000 spectators were in the ground. The lineup was four dogs; in trap one was Beadsman at 20–1; trap two was Palatinus at 3–1; trap three was Entomb at 9–2, and finally Mick the Miller in trap four, wearing the black jacket. Palatinus made the best start, at the first bend both Mick and Entomb attempted to move inside to the rail, but Beadsman collided with both of them, sending all three dogs sprawling. The no–race klaxon went off, and the race had to be restarted. None of the dogs was allowed to leave the track with until the race was re–run at 9:15pm, the only comfort given to Mick on a particularly hot summer's evening was a handkerchief soaked in cold water.|$|E

500|$|Hasbro {{introduced}} Sindy in France and continental Europe in 1994 after minor facial {{modifications to}} reduce her resemblance to Barbie. A Neilsen study suggested Sindy could obtain 20% of the ₣500–600m market in France alone. The {{chief executive of}} Hasbro France, Paul Audouy, said recent innovations {{such as the ability}} for Sindy to swim and walk a small <b>dog</b> <b>would</b> strengthen her market position. Hasbro invested ₣5 million {{in the first week of}} her advertising launch. A new black friend for Sindy was released in 1995, named Imani, 30 years after Sindy's American friend Gayle was withdrawn after low sales. Hasbro released the new doll in response to [...] "overwhelming demand".|$|E
500|$|During Adams' tenure, {{the college}} {{acquired}} a new mascot, {{the first since}} the original Reveille died in 1944. Reveille II, like the original Reveille, was cared for and attended to by band members. During halftime performances, the young dog was allowed {{to be on the}} field with the band without her leash. During these breaks where she could get out and run, she had a tendency to [...] "do her business" [...] on Kyle Field's playing surface. This didn't bother the band members much, as Reveille stayed away from the band, but Adams discovered a gambling scheme whereby cadets were taking bets on what yardline the <b>dog</b> <b>would</b> defecate. He quickly ended the practice and turned the responsibility of caring for Reveille over to Company E-2, which has since been called the Mascot Company.|$|E
500|$|Zenna was {{replaced}} in the soap by her daughter Chancer, {{who was in}} turn succeeded by her own daughter, Kyte. Kyte played Wellard for seven years, longer than Zenna and Chancer. The dog, whose pedigree name is Minka [...] Kyte, came to the soap from Raddings' company Stunt Dogs, along with another EastEnders dog, Terence. She had previous experience in the television and film industry, having appeared on A Touch of Frost, The Jonny Vaughan Show, 102 Dalmatians and Gladiator. Raddings revealed that Kyte came to understand the words [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut", meaning the director would sometimes have to give an alternate cue such as [...] "go" [...] during scenes featuring Wellard, as the <b>dog</b> <b>would</b> become instantly alert upon hearing the usual commands, which appeared incongruous in scenes which called for Wellard to be relaxed. Kyte worked closely with Mohammed George, who played Wellard's owner Gus. George was afraid of dogs as a child, but after working with Kyte for three years, commented that they were so close he [...] "sometimes [...] like [...] dad." ...|$|E
