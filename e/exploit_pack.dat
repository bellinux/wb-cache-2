40|$|Abstract. Group {{communication}} {{is one of}} the main paradigms for implementing replication middleware. The high run-time costs of group communication may constitute a major performance bottleneck for modern enterprise applications. In this paper we investigate the applicability of message packing, a technique originally proposed by Friedman and Van Renesse in 1997 for improving the performance of group communication, to modern hardware and group communication toolkits. Most importantly, we extend this technique with a policy for varying the packing degree automatically, based on dynamic estimates of the optimal packing degree. The resulting system is adaptive in that it allows <b>exploiting</b> message <b>packing</b> efficiently in a dynamic and potentially unknown run-time environment. Several case studies are analyzed. ...|$|R
40|$|Large circuits, {{whether they}} are arithmetic, digital signal processing, switching, or processors, {{typically}} contain a greater portion of highly regular datapath logic. Datapath synthesis algorithms preserve these regular structures, {{so they can be}} <b>exploited</b> by <b>packing,</b> placement, and routing tools for speed or density. Typical datapath synthesis algorithms, however, sacrifice area to gain regularity. Current algorithms can have as much as 30 % to 40 % area inflation when compared with traditional flat synthesis algorithms. This paper describes a datapath synthesis algorithm with very low area overhead, which is an enhancement to the module compaction algorithm proposed in [8]. We propose two word-level optimizations — multiplexer tree collapsing and operation reordering. They reduce the area inflation t...|$|R
50|$|Nazca {{subsistence}} {{was based}} largely on agriculture. Iconography on ceramics and excavated remains indicate that the Nazca people had a varied diet, composed of maize, squash, sweet potato, manioc and achira, and a small trace of various fish. They also used several non-food crops, such as cotton for textiles, coca, San Pedro cactus, and gourds. The latter were decorated to illustrate activities in daily life. The evidence of coca in society can be seen through remains but also through ceramics. This {{is the same for}} the hallucinogenic San Pedro cactus, which has been illustrated in ceremonies on several polychrome pots and bowls. In terms of animal resources, the Nazca made sacrifices of llamas and guinea pigs at Cahuachi. Llamas were also commonly <b>exploited</b> as <b>pack</b> animals, for their wool, and as a source of meat.|$|R
25|$|Most shellcode {{is written}} in machine code because of the low level at which the {{vulnerability}} being exploited gives an attacker access to the process. Shellcode is therefore often created to target one specific combination of processor, operating system and service pack, called a platform. For some exploits, due to the constraints put on the shellcode by the target process, a very specific shellcode must be created. However, it is not impossible for one shellcode to work for multiple <b>exploits,</b> service <b>packs,</b> operating systems and even processors. Such versatility is commonly achieved by creating multiple versions of the shellcode that target the various platforms and creating a header that branches to the correct version for the platform the code is running on. When executed, the code behaves differently for different platforms and executes the right part of the shellcode for the platform it is running on.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{scalable}} discriminative training framework for parsing-based statistical machine translation. Our framework <b>exploits</b> hypergraphs (or <b>packed</b> forests) to compactly encode exponentially many competing translations, {{and uses the}} perceptron algorithm to learn to discriminatively prefer the oracle-best tree in the hypergraph. To facilitate training, we present: (i) an oracle extraction algorithm to efficiently extract the oracle trees from a hypergraph that best match the reference translations; (ii) a hypergraph pruning algorithm that substantially reduces the disk space required for storing the hypergraphs without degrading the translation quality; and (iii) simple yet effective data and feature selection algorithms by which an equally good or better model is obtained using {{a fraction of the}} training data and features. We experimentally show that our approach is scalable and is able to improve over a full-scale state-of-the-art hierarchical machine translation system. ...|$|R

40|$|Recently a novel reactor {{concept for}} chemical-looping {{combustion}} (CLC) {{has been proposed}} <b>exploiting</b> dynamically operated <b>packed</b> beds. In this work, an experimental parametric study on this reactor concept has been carried out. The effects of operating temperature, feed oxygen concentration, steam addition, and type of oxygen carrier material (CuO/Al 2 O 3 and CaMnO 3) have been evaluated. It {{has been found that}} an increase of the reduction temperature resulted in a higher conversion of the oxygen carrier, increased reduction reaction rates, and increasing significance of various side-reactions. Steam addition suppresses carbon deposition on the oxygen carrier. Interesting insights in the relevance of steam reforming and water-gas shift during the reduction cycle were obtained. Finally, CaMnO 3 is of interest for CLC in packed beds in view of the high oxygen capacity of the material and the excellent selectivity to the formation of CO 2...|$|R
40|$|Web {{applications}} are {{the target of}} many well known exploits and also a fertile ground for the discovery of security vulnerabilities. Yet, the success of an exploit depends both on the vulnerability in the application source code and {{the environment in which}} the application is deployed and run. As execution environments are complex (application servers, databases and other supporting applications), {{we need to have a}} reliable framework to test whether known exploits can be reproduced in different settings, better understand their effects, and facilitate the discovery of new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present TestREx - a framework that allows for highly automated, easily repeatable exploit testing in a variety of contexts, so that a security tester may quickly and efficiently perform large-scale experiments with vulnerability <b>exploits.</b> It supports <b>packing</b> and running applications with their environments, injecting exploits, monitoring their success, and generating security reports.

40|$|Multidimensional imaging resolving {{both the}} cardiac and {{respiratory}} cycles simultaneously {{has the potential}} to describe important physiological interdependences between the heart and pulmonary processes. A fully five-dimensional acquisition with three spatial and two temporal dimensions is hampered, however, by the long acquisition time and low spatial resolution. A technique is proposed to reduce the scan time substantially by extending the k-t BLAST framework to two temporal dimensions. By sampling the k-t space sparsely in a lattice grid, the signal in the transform domain, x-f space, can be densely <b>packed,</b> <b>exploiting</b> the fact that large regions in the field of view have low temporal bandwidth. A volumetric online prospective triggering approach with full cardiac and respiratory cycle coverage was implemented. Retrospective temporal interpolation was used to refine the timing estimates for the center of k-space, which is sampled for all cardiac and respiratory time frames. This resulted in reduced reconstruction error compared with conventional k-t BLAST reconstruction. The k-t 2 BLAST technique was evaluated by decimating a fully sampled five-dimensional data set, and feasibility was further demonstrated by performing sparsely sampled acquisitions. Compared to the fully sampled data, a fourfold improvement in spatial resolution was accomplished in approximately half the scan time...|$|R

40|$|Until the 1960 s, liquids were {{generally}} regarded as either dense gases or dis-ordered solids, and theoretical attempts at understanding their structures and properties were largely based on those concepts. Bernal, himself a crystallog-rapher, was unhappy with either approach, preferring to regard simple liquids as ‘homogeneous, coherent and essentially irregular assemblages of molecules containing no crystalline regions’. He set about realizing this conceptual model through a detailed examination of the structures and properties of ran-dom packings of spheres. In order to test {{the relevance of the}} model to real liquids, ways had to be found to realize and characterize random packings. This was at a time when computing was slow and in its infancy, so he and his collaborators set about building models in the laboratory, and examining aspects of their structures in order to characterize them in ways which would enable comparison with the properties of real liquids. Some of the imaginative – often time consuming and frustrating – routes followed are described, as well the comparisons made with the properties of simple liquids. With the increase of the power of computers in the 1960 s, computational approaches became increasingly <b>exploited</b> in random <b>packing</b> studies. This enabled the use of packing concepts, and the tools developed to characterize them, in understanding systems as diverse as metallic glasses, crystal–liquid interfaces, protein structures, enzyme–substrate interactions and the distribution of galax-ies, as well as their exploitation in, for example, oil extraction, understanding chromatographic separation columns, and packed beds in industrial processes...|$|R
