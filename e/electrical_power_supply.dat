5|$|Fischer {{attempted}} to gain wider {{support for the}} cooperation schemes already in place and extend their scope in Sector West. Fischer also assured the local authorities of the RSK that {{such a move would}} prevent renewed fighting in the area. The result of Fischer's efforts was the Daruvar Agreement. The agreement, signed in Daruvar on 18 February, encompassed the reconstruction of water and <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> networks, the reopening of the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway section in Sector West for non-commercial traffic, the facilitation of the Novska–Nova Gradiška railway, the repair of telecommunication lines, the establishment of a joint commission tasked with normalisation of living conditions in Sector West, the return of all refugees to their homes, the access to property owned by civilians across the ceasefire line, and further meetings with local authorities to discuss further cooperation.|$|E
5|$|The Daruvar Agreement (Croatian, Serbian: Daruvarski sporazum) was a {{document}} negotiated by Croatian and Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) local {{authorities in the}} United Nations Protected Area (UNPA) for the SAO Western Slavonia, also known as Sector West on 18 February 1993, during the Croatian War of Independence. The agreement provided {{for the improvement of}} water and <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> the return of refugees to their homes and the opening of transport routes spanning Sector West and connecting Croatian Army-controlled areas near towns of Nova Gradiška and Novska. It also provided a framework for the further improvement of living conditions of the population both in the Croatian- and RSK-controlled portions of Sector West. The agreement was named after Daruvar, the site of its signing.|$|E
5|$|This Case further {{represented}} {{the development of}} the incandescent electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case #1. These electric lamps were from worldwide inventors that worked directly with Edison on ideas. The electric light bulbs were grouped chronologically from 1881 to 1904. Among these were some Diehl's induction lamps for use with alternating current. A description of how this technology worked is that of a secondary coil of wire was placed inside the bulb of a vacuum. The two ends of the coiled wire connected to the filament that was electrified and provided the light. A primary coil was wound {{on the outside of the}} glass bulb. This coil was connected to an alternating current <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> The secondary coil inside the bulb would receive this alternating magnetism from the primary coil and provide an electrical current that electrified the inside filament. Ultimately this type of alternating current technology never developed and was not used. Pictures of some of the lamps that were in this display are below. These were later numbered 358 to 536.|$|E

25|$|Fluorescent lamps are a {{non-linear}} {{load and}} generate harmonic currents in the <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> The arc within the lamp may generate radio frequency noise, {{which can be}} conducted through power wiring.

50|$|The {{simplest}} solution taps {{off some}} {{hot exhaust gas}} from the propulsion motor and routes it instead through the generator turbine.

25|$|A railgun {{consists}} of two parallel metal rails (hence the name) connected to an <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> When a conductive projectile is inserted between the rails (at the end connected to the power supply), it completes the circuit. Electrons flow from the negative terminal of the power supply up the negative rail, across the projectile, and down the positive rail, back to the power supply.|$|E
25|$|A {{stick shaker}} is a device (available in some {{hydraulic}} aircraft) that {{is attached to}} the control column, which shakes the control column when the aircraft is about to stall.

These {{were not the only}} goods that required new thinking for modal shift to sustainable freight transport mode; fresh fish was once such further product type that emerged during the preliminary research, showing potentially large unexploited niches of the logistics market as available to pro-active entrepreneurs.|$|R

Because it operates with magnetic fields, launcher not limited by gas-expansion thermodynamics.

25|$|If {{the rail}} {{line has been}} built with {{sufficient}} vertical clearance then Double-stack rail transport can be used. Where lines are electrified with overhead electric wiring double stacking is normally not possible. The mandatory requirement to fit under overhead wire for the traction engine <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> sets the height limit for the railcars to allow for trailer transport. This requires a certain low building height {{which led to a}} minor size of wheels for the railcars. Hence increased degradation of bogeys by wheel wear-out is a cost disadvantage for the system.|$|E
25|$|Their {{electrical}} system {{differed from the}} BR and NIR versions. The generator van contained two engine/generator sets, each supplying 220/380 V 50Hz AC to two separate electrical buses in the train. The air conditioning loads were divided in half, each half fed from a separate bus. In the case of failure of one generator set, the other set automatically supplies both buses. Air conditioning output power would then be halved, but all other loads including cooking, lighting and battery charging {{would continue to be}} supplied. This later remained the model for the <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> on all subsequent IE coaches.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{agreed to}} lease 43 acres on the STAR campus to The Data Centers (TDC) {{for the construction}} of the data center. The data center plan included a combined heat cycle natural gas-fired power plant capable of generating 279 megawatts of energy. TDC claimed that the power plant was critical to ensuring an uninterrupted <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> to the facility, which is critical for data integrity. The TDC business plan also called for sale of excess electricity. Portions of the Newark community questioned the business plan, claiming that the power plant is not an auxiliary part of the data center but a separate industrial use, which would violate the zoning of the STAR campus.|$|E

500|$|The HV {{units were}} {{replaced}} by HVO elements on 11 October. The HVO 1st Guards and 2nd Guards brigades took over the northward advance from the HV 4th Guards and 7th Guards brigades, while the HVO 3rd Guards Brigade relieved the 1st HGZ and the 126th Home Guard Regiment. The VRS defence was disorganised, and they were gradually pushed north, while maintaining effective artillery fire support for their retreating troops. By {{the end of the}} day, the HVO had captured the Bočac Hydroelectric Power Station. The final objective was achieved when the force reached a line [...] south of Banja Luka. The advance reportedly came within [...] of Banja Luka, whose <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> was interrupted, and where a curfew was imposed in response to the deteriorating situation. Operation Southern Move ended on the night of 11/12 October.|$|E

2500|$|The 1986 {{disaster}} in Chernobyl, USSR {{is generally considered}} to be the worst nuclear disaster, to date. On 25 April 1986, during routine maintenance, the crew at Chernobyl began preparing for a test of the reactor's turbine. During the test, the site experienced a loss of their main <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> [...] Because of this loss of power, the automatic shutdown mechanisms failed, and the reactor started to become unstable. As the Chernobyl operators tried to cool the rods by inserting them into the reactor core, a large power surge occurred. This is generally believed to be from a design flaw in the rods.|$|E

A subsequent investigation by NHK would later reveal that the isolation condenser units had not been tested or operated in over 40 years.

2500|$|This type of {{device is}} {{generally}} considered obsolete as pilot lights can waste a surprising amount of gas (in {{the same way a}} dripping faucet can waste a large amount of water over an extended period), and are also no longer used on stoves, but are still to be found in many gas water heaters and gas fireplaces. Their poor efficiency is acceptable in water heaters, since most of the energy [...] "wasted" [...] on the pilot still represents a direct heat gain for the water tank. The Millivolt system also makes it unnecessary for a special electrical circuit to be run to the water heater or furnace; these systems are often completely self-sufficient and can run without any external <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> [...] For tankless [...] "on demand" [...] water heaters, pilot ignition is preferable because it is faster than hot-surface ignition and more reliable than spark ignition.|$|E
