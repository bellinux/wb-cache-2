25|$|The {{parabolic}} form of St Paul's {{was made}} possible by the use of <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber for the internal arches. Laminated timber arches, constructed by overlapping and bolting together small pieces of timber to make a single, large member, have been in use in Australia since the mid-19th century. Cost-effective and able to span large distances without intermediate posts, laminated timber arches also became an alternative system for roof structures of large buildings such as markets, factories and, from the early 20th century, large auditoria and picture theatres. The process of glue lamination, using casein glue to bond the layers of timber rather than bolts, originated in Germany before being introduced to the United States in the 1920s. Several publications in the 1930s and early 1940s provided the necessary data for constructing <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber arches, and became a source of inspiration for Australian designers. The earliest experiments in Australia took place in the early 1940s and the arrival of powerful synthetic resin adhesives in the post- World War II period increased the reliability and range of applications of glue lamination. The former Burge Bros Factory in Melbourne (1945–46) is considered to be the oldest known surviving example of this technology in Australia, with semi-circular arches spanning 30 metres, manufactured by Sydney-based company Ralph Symonds Ltd.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop new composite bridge concepts that are easily buildable and have a high grade of prefabrication by using reinforced <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> timber beams and steel trusses. All structural parts are designed so that minimal assembly is required and all elements are easily transportable. <b>Glue</b> <b>laminated</b> timber reinforced with synthetic straps was chosen due to its superior resistance, enhanced elastic behaviour under loading-unloading cycles, and other good mechanical properties, all based on previously conduced experimental studies, as well as other known advantages of classic <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> timber elements. A modular prefabricated bridge model was proposed that could cover small and medium spans and is both economic and easy to build. These timber beams combined with the rigidity and light weight of steel trusses could make an affordable and strong alternative for concrete slabs or other prefabricated elements that are mostly used for short-span bridges...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{strength}} of the bamboo increases from innner surface layer (endodermis) to outer surface layer (exodermis). The {{strength of}} bamboo can be utilized optimally by making <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> bamboo beams. The curved bamboo lamina {{as part of the}} <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> beam may be made by peeling off slightly the outer surface layer that contains high strength of fibers. The lamina thickness is made by disposing inner layer of the bamboo. The bamboo used in this work belongs to the species of Bambusa Dendrocalamus asper (local name: bambu Petung). This research aims to improve the shear and flexural {{strength of the}} <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> bamboo beams by modifying the shape of the cross section of the lamina (curved) rather than ordinary rectangular shape of the lamina. The dimensions of the cross-section of the lamina were of 7 / 20 mm and 9 / 20 mm. The laminas were preserved by immersing them in a hot water having chemical solution namely “Natrium Tetrabonat or CCB 4 ” with a concentration of 10 %. Having dry air the laminas were glued using adhesive type PVAC and were staked under 2. 5 MPa. The cross section dimensions of the beam specimen in shear and bending were of 70 / 100 - 900 mm and of 70 / 100 - 285 mm, and of 750 mm and 2700 mm long respectively. The simply supported <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> beams were tested upon two point loads at a distance of 1 / 3 the length of the span. The results showed that the <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> bamboo beams having curved type of laminas are stronger, more rigid, and more ductile compared to rectangular lamina type. Likewise, the <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> bamboo beams having 7 mm thick of lamina are stronger, stiffer, and ductile compared to the <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> beam with laminas of 9 mm thick. The average flexural strength of BBR 7 (rectangular, 7 mm thick of lamina), BBR 9 (rectangular, 9 mm thick of lamina), BBC 7 (curved, 7 mm thick of lamina) and BBC 9 (curved, 9 mm thick of lamina) are respectively (68. 80, 9. 28, 63. 28, 2. 00) N/mm 2. The flexural rigidity of related beams are respectively (68. 36, 71. 05, 75. 06, 65. 17) N/mm, and the ductility are respectively (2. 35, 2. 16, 1. 87, 2. 63). The related average shear strength of SBR 7, SBR 9, SBC 7 and SBC 9 are respectively (2. 72, 2. 61, 2. 32, 2. 64) N/mm 2, while the shear rigidity are respectively (2, 737. 08, 3, 029. 77, 3, 123. 87, 2, 794. 82) N/mm...|$|R

2500|$|Lautner ingeniously {{solved the}} problem of the 45-degree slope by siting the entire house off the ground atop a 50-foot (15m) {{concrete}} pillar that rests on a massive concrete pad 20 feet (6.1m) in diameter and 3 feet (0.91m) thick, buried into the rocky hillside. Halfway up the pillar, eight angled steel [...] "spokes"— bolted onto bosses formed onto the surface of the column— splay out and up, supporting and stabilizing the outer rim of the house, and the center of the pillar also houses the utility cables and pipes. Lautner provided access from the driveway up the steep hillside by installing a funicular, which terminates at a short sloping gangway that leads up to the entrance. The house is octagonal in plan and lozenge-shape in section, and is often described as a [...] "flying saucer". Since there are effectively no solid external walls— the entire outer [...] "face" [...] of the house is eight large picture windows— the Chemosphere enjoys a panoramic view over the San Fernando valley.

The method used for the testing was the ASTM D 143 - 1970. For {{the purpose of the}} test, 8 x 12 x 400 cm lumbers of the three species were divided into two groups being de- signated respectively for test in solid and <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> form.

In bending tests, two methods of loading were applied, namely perpendicular and parallel to the laminae in case of <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> timbers, and along radial or tangential direction for solid timbers. The second group were resawn further into 0. 9 cm and 1. 9 cm thick timber strips, respectioely, for small size tests of the <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> specimens. The 0. 9 cm thick strips which were air-dried and then glued with CIBA Phenol resorcinol-formal-dehyde adhesives, were designated for test on modulus of rupture and compression. The 1. 9 cm thick strips were divided further into five batches, and each of which were dried respectively until 25, 20, 15, 10 and 5 percent moisture content before glueing with the above mentioned adhesive into six different combination of test pieces namely Teah-Meranti (JM), Teak-Kapur (JK), Meranti-Kapur (MK), Kapur-kapur (KK), Teak-Teak (JJ) and meranti-Meranti (MM).
