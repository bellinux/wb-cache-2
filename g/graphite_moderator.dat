5|$|An {{important}} {{area of research}} concerned the Wigner effect. Under bombardment by neutrons, the carbon atoms in the <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator</b> can be knocked out of the graphite's crystalline structure. Over time, this causes the graphite to heat and swell. Investigation of the problem would take most of 1946 before a fix was found.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} discovery Wigner {{made during}} the project was the Wigner effect. This is a swelling of the <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator</b> caused by the displacement of atoms by neutron radiation. The Wigner effect was a serious problem for the reactors at the Hanford Site in the immediate post-war period, and resulted in production cutbacks and a reactor being shut down entirely. It was eventually discovered {{that it could be}} overcome by controlled heating and annealing.|$|E
5|$|At Hanford, {{plutonium}} production {{fell off}} as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and {{swelling of the}} <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator</b> known as the Wigner effect. The swelling damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable. In {{order to maintain the}} supply of polonium for the urchin initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would be available in the future. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a redox solvent extraction process as an alternative plutonium extraction technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state from which it could not easily be recovered.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{begins with}} a brief {{presentation}} of future nuclear reactors. Next, current uses of ceramics in the nuclear industry are reviewed, which, {{with the exception of}} <b>graphite</b> <b>moderators</b> and B 4 C control rods, rely largely on oxides or silicates. Then, the potential for using non-oxide Ultra-High Temperature Ceramics (UHTCs) and MAX phases in future (so-called Generation IV) fission and fusion reactors is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Past {{pilot and}} {{demonstration}} projects have all used thermal designs with <b>graphite</b> <b>moderators.</b> As such, no true gas-cooled fast reactor design {{has ever been}} brought to criticality. The main challenges {{that have yet to}} be overcome are in-vessel structural materials, both in-core and out-of-core, that will have to withstand fast-neutron damage and high temperatures, (up to 1600 °C). Another problem is the low thermal inertia and poor heat removal capability at low helium pressures, although these issues are shared with thermal reactors which have been constructed.|$|R
50|$|In the {{advanced}} gas-cooled reactor, a British design, the core {{is made of}} a <b>graphite</b> neutron <b>moderator</b> where the fuel assemblies are located. Carbon dioxide gas acts as a coolant and it circulates through the core, removing heat.|$|R
25|$|From May 2012 to December 2013, Leningrad-1 was offline while repairs {{were made}} related to {{deformed}} <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator</b> blocks. The 18-month project included {{research and the}} development of maintenance machines and monitoring systems. Similar work will be applied to the remaining operational RBMKs. <b>Graphite</b> <b>moderator</b> blocks in the RBMK can be repaired and replaced in situ, unlike in the other current large graphite moderated reactor, the Advanced gas-cooled reactor.|$|E
25|$|In October 2014 a {{new kind}} of crack in the <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator</b> bricks was found at the Hunterston B reactor. This keyway root crack has been {{previously}} theorized but not observed. The existence of this type of crack does not immediately affect the safety of a reactor – however if the number of cracks exceed a threshold the reactor would be decommissioned, as the cracks cannot be repaired.|$|E
25|$|The AGR {{retained}} the Magnox's <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator</b> and CO2 coolant but increased its operating temperature to improve efficiency when converted to steam. The steam it produced was deliberately {{identical to that}} from a coal fired plant, allowing the same turbines and generation equipment to be used. During the initial design stages the system was forced to switch the tubing enclosing the fuel pellets from beryllium to stainless steel. Steel has a higher cross section and this change demanded the switch to enriched uranium fuel to maintain criticality. As part of this change, the new design had higher burnup of 18,000 MWt-days per tonne of fuel, requiring less frequent refuelling.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{water was}} first {{produced}} in 1932, {{a few months}} after the discovery of deuterium. With the discovery of nuclear fission in late 1938, and the need for a neutron moderator that captured few neutrons, heavy water became a component of early nuclear energy research. Since then, heavy water has been an essential component in some types of reactors, both those that generate power and those designed to produce isotopes for nuclear weapons. These heavy water reactors have the advantage of being able to run on natural uranium without using <b>graphite</b> <b>moderators</b> that pose radiological and dust explosion hazards in the decommissioning phase. Most modern reactors use enriched uranium with ordinary water as the moderator.|$|R
50|$|Good moderators {{are also}} free of neutron-absorbing {{impurities}} such as boron. In commercial {{nuclear power plants}} the moderator typically contains dissolved boron. The boron concentration of the reactor coolant can be changed by the operators by adding boric acid or by diluting with water to manipulate reactor power. The Nazi Nuclear Program suffered a substantial setback when its inexpensive <b>graphite</b> <b>moderators</b> failed to work. At that time, most graphites were deposited on boron electrodes, and the German commercial graphite contained too much boron. Since the war-time German program never discovered this problem, {{they were forced to}} use far more expensive heavy water moderators. In the U.S., Leó Szilárd, a former chemical engineer, discovered the problem.|$|R

25|$|Because {{of known}} {{shrinkage}} of the <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator</b> bricks {{in the core}} due to in-service irradiation effects, some of the steel charge pans {{on top of them}} had become dislocated from their design position in the interstitial channel and were suspended from the Burst Can Detection (BCD) pipework. This was most prevalent in Reactor 1 because of the different core design to Reactors 2, 3 and 4. BNFL were unable to make an adequate safety case or effect an economic repair and therefore, Reactor 1 did not return to power from its annual outage in August 2001. The core of Reactor 4 was repaired but this reactor did not return to power after the repair.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, the RBMK reactor design used at Chernobyl, {{which uses}} {{graphite}} instead of water as the moderator and uses boiling water as the coolant, {{has a large}} positive thermal coefficient of reactivity, that increases heat generation when coolant water temperatures increase. This makes the RBMK design less stable than pressurized water reactors. In addition to its property of slowing down neutrons when serving as a moderator, water also has a property of absorbing neutrons, albeit to a lesser degree. When the coolant water temperature increases, the boiling increases, which creates voids. Thus there is less water to absorb thermal neutrons {{that have already been}} slowed down by the <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator,</b> causing an increase in reactivity. This property is called the void coefficient of reactivity, and in an RBMK reactor like Chernobyl, the void coefficient is positive, and fairly large, causing rapid transients.|$|E
25|$|A Soviet design, {{built to}} produce {{plutonium}} {{as well as}} power. RBMKs are water cooled with a <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator.</b> RBMKs are in some respects similar to CANDU {{in that they are}} refuelable during power operation and employ a pressure tube design instead of a PWR-style pressure vessel. However, unlike CANDU they are very unstable and large, making containment buildings for them expensive. A series of critical safety flaws have also been identified with the RBMK design, though some of these were corrected following the Chernobyl disaster. Their main attraction is their use of light water and un-enriched uranium. As of 2010, 11 remain open, mostly due to safety improvements and help from international safety agencies such as the DOE. Despite these safety improvements, RBMK reactors are still {{considered one of the most}} dangerous reactor designs in use. RBMK reactors were deployed only in the former Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor (SGHWR) is a United Kingdom {{design for}} {{commercial}} nuclear reactors. It {{is similar to}} the Canadian CANDU reactor designs in that it uses a low-pressure reactor vessel containing high-pressure piping for the coolant, which reduces construction costs and complexity. Like CANDU, it also uses heavy water as both a coolant and neutron moderator, in contrast with earlier UK designs that used <b>graphite</b> <b>moderators</b> which led to very large reactor sizes. Unlike CANDU, the SGHWR uses slightly enriched uranium fuel, which allows for higher burnup and more economical fuel cycles. The modern CANDU ACR-1000 reactor design uses a similar concept, as does the Italian CIRENE, hosted at Latina Nuclear Power Plant.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{research}} or test reactors built that use <b>graphite</b> as the <b>moderator.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{very first}} {{artificial}} nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1, used <b>graphite</b> as a <b>moderator.</b> <b>Graphite</b> moderated reactors {{were involved in}} two of the best known nuclear disasters: An untested graphite annealing process contributed to the Windscale fire (but the graphite itself did not catch fire), and a graphite fire during the Chernobyl disaster contributed to the spread of radioactive material (but was not a cause of the accident itself).|$|R
25|$|Inherent safety. LFTR designs use {{a strong}} {{negative}} temperature coefficient of reactivity to achieve passive inherent safety against excursions of reactivity. The temperature dependence comes from 3 sources. The first is that thorium absorbs more neutrons if it overheats, the so-called Doppler effect. This leaves fewer neutrons to continue the chain reaction, reducing power. The second part is heating the <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator,</b> that usually causes a positive contribution to the temperature coefficient. The third effect {{has to do with}} thermal expansion of the fuel. If the fuel overheats, it expands considerably, which, due to the liquid nature of the fuel, will push fuel out of the active core region. In a small (e.g. the MSRE test reactor) or well moderated core this reduces the reactivity. However, in a large, under-moderated core (e.g. the ORNL MSBR design), less fuel salt means better moderation and thus more reactivity and an undesirable positive temperature coefficient.|$|E
2500|$|Neutron {{damage to}} solid {{moderator}} materials can limit the core lifetime of an MSR that makes moderately fast neutrons. [...] For example, the MSRE was {{designed so that}} its <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator</b> sticks had very low tolerances, so neutron damage could change their size without damage. [...] "Two fluid" [...] MSR designs are unable to use graphite piping because graphite changes size when it is bombarded with neutrons, and graphite pipes would crack and leak.|$|E
2500|$|The fuel {{channels}} {{consist of}} welded zircaloy pressure tubes [...] in inner diameter with [...] thick walls, led through the channels {{in the center}} of the <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator</b> blocks. The top and bottom parts of the tubes are made of stainless steel, and joined with the central zircaloy segment with zirconium-steel alloy couplings. The pressure tube is held in the graphite stack channels with two alternating types of [...] high split graphite rings; one is in direct contact with the tube and has [...] clearance to the graphite stack, the other one is directly touching the graphite stack and has [...] clearance to the tube; this assembly reduces transfer of mechanical loads caused by neutron-induced swelling, thermal expansion of the blocks, and other factors to the pressure tube, while facilitating heat transfer from the graphite blocks. The tubes are welded to the top and bottom metal plates of the reactor vessel.|$|E
40|$|We present {{findings}} on the structure, energies and behaviour of defects in irradiated graphitic carbon materials. Defect production due to high-energy nuclear radiations experienced in <b>graphite</b> <b>moderators</b> is generally associated with undesirable changes in internal energy, microstructure and physical properties [...] the so-called Wigner effect. On the flip side, the controlled introduction and ability to handle such defects in the electron beam is considered a desirable way to engineer the properties of carbon nanostructures. In both cases, the atomic-level details of structure and interaction are only just beginning to be understood. Here, using a model system of crystalline graphite, we show from first-principles calculations, new details in the behaviour of vacancy and interstitial defects. We identify a prominent barrier-state to energy release, reveal a surprising ability of vacancy defects to bridge the widely spaced atomic layers, and discuss physical property and microstructure changes during irradiation, including interactions with dislocations...|$|R
25|$|In the U.S., {{however, the}} first {{experimental}} atomic reactor (1942), {{as well as}} the Manhattan Project Hanford production reactors that produced the plutonium for the Trinity test and Fat Man bombs, all used pure carbon (<b>graphite)</b> neutron <b>moderators</b> combined with normal water cooling pipes.

2500|$|The fuel is {{uranium dioxide}} pellets, enriched to 2.5-3.5%, in {{stainless}} steel tubes. The original design {{concept of the}} AGR was to use a beryllium based cladding. When this proved unsuitable due to brittle fracture, the enrichment level of the fuel was raised {{to allow for the}} higher neutron capture losses of stainless steel cladding. This significantly increased the cost of the power produced by an AGR. [...] The carbon dioxide coolant circulates through the core, reaching [...] and a pressure of around 40 bar (580 psi), and then passes through boiler (steam generator) assemblies outside the core but still within the steel-lined, reinforced concrete pressure vessel. Control rods penetrate the <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator</b> and a secondary system involves injecting nitrogen into the coolant to hold the reactor temperature down. A tertiary shutdown system which operates by injecting boron balls into the reactor is included in case the reactor has to be depressurized with insufficient control rods lowered. This would mean that nitrogen pressure can not be maintained.|$|E
2500|$|Limited {{graphite}} lifetime - Compact designs have {{a limited}} lifetime for the <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator</b> and fuel / breeding loop separator. Under the influence of fast neutrons, the graphite first shrinks, then expands indefinitely until it becomes very weak and can crack, creating mechanical problems and causing the graphite to absorb enough fission products to poison the reaction. The 1960 two-fluid design had an estimated graphite replacement period of four years. Eliminating graphite from sealed piping was a major incentive {{to switch to a}} single-fluid design. Replacing this large central part requires remotely operated equipment. MSR designs have to arrange for this replacement. In a molten salt reactor, virtually all of the fuel and fission products can be piped to a holding tank. Only a fraction of one percent of the fission products end up in the graphite, primarily due to fission products slamming into the graphite. This makes the graphite surface radioactive, and without recycling/removal of at least the surface layer, creates a fairly bulky waste stream. Removing the surface layer and recycling the remainder of the graphite would solve this issue. Several techniques exist to recycle or dispose of nuclear moderator graphite. Graphite is inert and immobile at low temperatures, so it can be readily stored or buried if required. At least one design used graphite balls (pebbles) floating in salt, which could be removed and inspected continuously without shutting down the reactor. Reducing power density increases graphite lifetime. [...] By comparison, solid-fueled reactors typically replace 1/3 of the fuel elements, including all of the highly radioactive fission products therein, every 12 to 24 months. This is routinely done under a protecting and cooling column layer of water.|$|E
5000|$|The fuel being {{dissolved}} in FLiBe makes curtailment of fission easy. Any mechanism (including damage) which drains the FLiBe {{away from the}} reactor core will leave the (solid) <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator</b> behind, hence the fuel no longer capable of sustaining fission. Even an overheated reactor would remain far (several hundred °C) cooler than the melting temperature of the <b>graphite</b> <b>moderator</b> or reactor chamber.|$|E

[...] At the time, reactors existed only on paper, and no reactor had yet gone critical. In July 1942, Wigner chose a conservative 100 MW design, with a <b>graphite</b> neutron <b>moderator</b> and water cooling.

The reactor chamber's 2000-ton lid was lifted by the steam explosion. Since the reactor was not designed with a containment building capable of containing this catastrophic explosion, the accident released large amounts of radioactive material into the environment. The catastrophic fire in the <b>graphite</b> neutron <b>moderator</b> compounded the problem, sending massive amounts of radioactive debris into the atmosphere.|$|R
