5|$|Mac fends off Sue's {{advances}} {{by saying}} he will only allow her to touch his arse if she can raise £10,000 for Comic Relief. Sue then proceeds to try to ask Martin, Joanna, Guy and Alan for the money, which she eventually manages to raise, though Mac runs off before she can <b>get</b> <b>hold</b> of him.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the book was terminated by Bernoulli's death in 1705; thus the book is essentially incomplete when compared with Bernoulli's original vision. The quarrel with his younger brother Johann, who was the most competent person who could have fulfilled Jacob's project, prevented Johann to <b>get</b> <b>hold</b> of the manuscript. Jacob's own children were not mathematicians and were {{not up to the}} task of editing and publishing the manuscript. Finally Jacob's nephew Niklaus, 7 years after Jacob's death in 1705, managed to publish the manuscript in 1713.|$|E
6000|$|... "Millionaires I can understand," [...] said Syme thoughtfully, [...] "they {{are nearly}} all mad. But <b>getting</b> <b>hold</b> {{of a few}} wicked old gentlemen with hobbies is one thing; <b>getting</b> <b>hold</b> of great Christian nations is another. I would bet the nose off my face (forgive the allusion) that Sunday would stand {{perfectly}} helpless before the task of converting any ordinary healthy person anywhere." ...|$|R

5|$|On {{her way to}} Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, {{and asked}} him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, {{which may have been}} why Alizon was so keen to <b>get</b> <b>hold</b> of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether she meant to buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or whether she had no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father {{a few days after the}} incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.|$|E
5|$|Throughout this, Idelba {{has been}} {{secretly}} working on atomic physics {{and she and}} her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that {{it would be possible to}} make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions and fear that the military will try to create such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts concerned scientists in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to <b>get</b> <b>hold</b> of her papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss the nuclear issue. The meeting is held in Isfahan in Iran (one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war) and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree that none of them will work on the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship (they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference).|$|E
25|$|Bhattacharya {{suggests}} that the Tantrika may even murder to <b>get</b> <b>hold</b> of a suitable corpse for shava sadhana. A young chandala boy may be intoxicated and then killed by the tantrika by deceit. However, Professor McDaniel notes that tantrikas she met in Tarapith disagreed. They believed that the appropriate corpse is chosen by the Goddess herself and murdering someone for the ritual is interfering with the Goddess' work.|$|E

Bill said {{it was my fault}} for <b>getting</b> <b>hold</b> of the wrong picture, and I said it was Bill's fault for fetching me such a crack on the jaw that I couldn't be expected to see what I was <b>getting</b> <b>hold</b> of, {{and then there was a}} pretty massive silence for a bit.|$|R
25|$|Wapishana men craft wooden stools and baskets, sieves, and squeezers {{for use in}} the {{preparation}} of cassava and other foods. They also make arrows, fencing wire into points, but these arrows and bows they buy or <b>get</b> <b>hold</b> of from other Indians have been almost entirely replaced by shotguns. Women make clay cooking pots and spin cotton and weave the thread into baby slings and hammocks. Introduced crafts include needlework, dressmaking, and rustic furniture making.|$|E

When the commandant has been lulled to sleep by a berceuse, the young people manage to <b>get</b> <b>hold</b> of the letter and only give it back to him when he agrees to allow René to wed Dora. With a new wedding contract signed, the situation ends to everyone’s satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|Those British on the {{barricades}} — including Dalton and Bromhead — were soon engaged in fierce hand-to-hand fighting. The British wall {{was too high}} for the Zulus to scale, so they resorted to crouching under the wall, trying to <b>get</b> <b>hold</b> of the defenders' Martini–Henry rifles, slashing at British soldiers with assegais or firing their weapons through the wall. At places, they clambered over each other's bodies to drive the British off the walls but were driven back.|$|E

Meppaddan warns the family that the male {{members of the family}} should now lead a life of celibacy and that if the spirit is freed, then nobody, even Meppaddan himself, can't stop her.|$|R
25|$|Oswald {{returned}} to Tyrol {{to find himself}} completely penniless. Count Friedrich insisted on the payment of the 6,000 ducat surety. Oswald {{tried in vain to}} <b>get</b> <b>hold</b> of the money, and fled the Tyrol. In 1425 he resided in Castle Neuhaus near Gais, which at this point was not yet part of the County of Tyrol, but part of the County of Görz. Friedrich immediately used the peace with King Sigismund to renew the siege of Castle Greifenstein.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{collapse}} of the former Woolworths Group, 99p Stores took the opportunity to acquire 15 of the vacant stores, increasing their estate to 79. They reached 100 stores in August 2009 and, as of December 2009, the retail chain had acquired and reopened 52 former Woolworths stores. New store openings prove so popular that bosses have recently been requesting friendly police presence for crowd control purposes for desperate shoppers who queue from 5am {{to be the first to}} <b>get</b> <b>hold</b> of first-customer bargains.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountain}} is mentioned {{several times and}} {{is used as a}} backdrop to the story of Mary Jones and her Bible. This story is an account of a girl from Llanfihangel-y-Pennant {{at the foot of the}} mountain who walked 25 miles to Bala in order to buy a bible, which were scarce at the time.

Sun Ce had 13 other men with him, including Han Dang, Song Qian and Huang Gai. Taishi Ci rode forth and engaged Sun Ce in battle. Sun Ce thrust his spear at Taishi Ci's horse and managed to grab the handheld ji that Taishi carried on his back. Taishi Ci, on the other hand, managed to <b>get</b> <b>hold</b> of Sun Ce's helmet. Their fight was broken up when their respective subordinates showed up.|$|E

(Pennoyer had just left the Democratic Party to become the second Populist Party governor in history.) “No permission will be given to use state cannon for firing a salute over the inauguration of a Wall Street plutocrat as president of the United States,” he said, and locked the cannon away under armed guard. The Democrats were able to <b>get</b> <b>hold</b> of the cannon by using an unpaid blacksmith's bill for $10 as a pretext to have the sheriff seize the weapon, and the salute was fired on schedule.|$|E

Velu finally hands over the original pen drive to Officer Menon as the film ends.|$|E
25|$|International cricket in India {{generally}} {{does not}} follow a fixed pattern. For example, the English schedule under which the nation tours other countries during winter and plays at home during the summer. Generally, there has recently been a tendency to play more one-day matches than Test matches. Cricket in India is managed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the richest cricket board in the cricket world, yet, average cricket fans cannot <b>get</b> <b>hold</b> of tickets to see matches, much of which are distributed as largesse. Indian International Cricket Squad has also provided {{some of the greatest}} players to the world, the biggest example of which is Sachin Tendulkar. Indian cricket has a rich history. The Indian national team is currently ranked the No. 1 team in Test, ODI and but at 5th position in T20I, making it the best cricket team in the world.|$|E
