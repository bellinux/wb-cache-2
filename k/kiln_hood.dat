5000|$|The {{assessment}} of the clinker peak temperature has always been problematic. Contact temperature measurement is impossible because of the chemically aggressive and abrasive nature of the hot clinker, and optical methods such as infrared pyrometry are difficult because of the dust and fume-laden atmosphere in the burning zone. The traditional method of assessment was to view the bed of clinker and deduce the amount of liquid formation by experience. As more liquid forms, the clinker becomes stickier, and the bed of material climbs higher up the rising side of the kiln. It is usually also possible to assess {{the length of the}} zone of liquid formation, beyond which powdery [...] "fresh" [...] feed can be seen. Cameras, with or without infrared measurement capability, are mounted on the <b>kiln</b> <b>hood</b> to facilitate this. On many kilns, the same information can be inferred from the kiln motor power drawn, since sticky feed riding high on the kiln wall increases the eccentric turning load of the kiln. Further information can be obtained from the exhaust gas analyzers. The formation of NO from nitrogen and oxygen takes place only at high temperatures, and so the NO level gives an indication of the combined feed and flame temperature. SO2 is formed by thermal decomposition of calcium sulfate in the clinker, and so also gives in indication of clinker temperature. Modern computer control systems usually make a [...] "calculated" [...] temperature, using contributions from all these information sources, and then set about controlling it.|$|E
40|$|The {{pelletizing}} {{process where}} the crude ore from the mine is upgraded to pellets {{is a process}} which includes several stages involving complex fluid dynamics. In this thesis, {{focus is on the}} grate-kiln pelletizing process and especially on the rotary kiln, with the objective to get {{a deeper understanding of the}} aerodynamics and its influence on the combustion process. The aim is to discover flow features taking place in the kiln, and the <b>kiln</b> <b>hood,</b> by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on simplified models of the real kiln, and to validate the set-ups of the numerical model with physical experiments using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). By starting as simple as possible, studying only the cold flow field without combustion and validating the simulations, a foundation for future geometrical optimizations can be achieved. Later on more realistic geometries may be studied with the validated simulations as a base. In Paper A the initial down-scaled, simplified model of the real kiln is studied, and both numerical and experimental analyses of the flow field are performed. Paper B focuses on the turbulent secondary flow that arises in ducts with non-circular cross-section. One of the inlet ducts to the kiln of interest here is close to semi-circular in cross section, hence the focus of this work. Numerical and experimental results are reported. Paper C is a development of the model, where instead of parallel inlet ducts as in Paper A, the top one has an inclination angle to the kiln axis. A thorough experimental analysis of the flow field is performed in this case. Conclusions are that steady state simulations can be used to get an overview over the main features of the flow field. Precautions should though be taken when analyzing the recirculation zone which is important for the flame stabilization. A stable flame is safe and crucial for efficient combustion. Steady state simulations do not capture the transient, oscillating behavior of the flow seen in the physical experiment. These oscillations will under certain conditions considerably affect the size of the recirculation zone. Another parameter affecting the size of the recirculation zone is the inclination of the upper inlet duct, where a decrease in recirculation length is seen although the actual inclination of the incoming jet is only about 3 - 4 º. The choice of turbulence model affects the prediction of turbulent secondary flow. If this flow feature needs to be revealed, a more advanced turbulence model should be used.

40|$|Rotary kilns are {{industrial}} furnaces {{that have}} been widely used in limestone calcination, cement industry and hazardous waste incineration for centuries. In this work a rotary kiln used for the iron ore pellet sintering process in the grate-kiln pelletizing system has been studied. In order to increase the energy efficiency, a large amount of air is supplied to the kiln through air channels connected to the cooler. This air is necessary for the coal combustion process and the heat transport to the kiln bed. However, the geometry of the <b>kiln</b> <b>hood</b> connecting the air channels and the cooler is complicated. As a consequence, the jet flame is unstable. In order to improve the performance of the jet flame it is therefore necessary to study the kiln aerodynamics to reveal the flow field. Even though it is a complicated problem containing fluid dynamics, combustion and heat and mass transfer, it can be simplified into a down-scaled cold model to make it feasible to understand the flow field both experimentally and numerically. In this work, the whole kiln is generalized as a high Reynolds number turbulent round jet interacting with asymmetric co-flows. With the aid from previous PIV measurement data of a down-scaled water model of the kiln, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations using the commercial code ANSYS CFX 16. 0 have been pursued for two main purposes: 1) To find a turbulence model that is computationally inexpensive and able to capture the main features of the mean flow field; 2) With the turbulence model chosen in 1), to study the geometrical effect {{on the development of the}} primary jet. In Paper A, three turbulence models were employed, the standard k-epsilon model, a modified k-epsilon model with slightly higher turbulence production and the SSG Reynolds stress model. Wall functions were applied since resolving the viscous wall region was not a concern in this work. It is found that the standard k-epsilon model fit the experimental data best compared to the other two models and that all three turbulence models predict an asymmetric development of the primary jet, especially far downstream, In Paper B, again using the down-scaled kiln model, isothermal cases with four different nozzle diameters were simulated with the standard k-epsilon model. The aim is to investigate the effect of initial Reynolds number on the jet development in asymmetric co-flows from the air channels. It is found that, with increasing Reynolds number, the jet becomes shorter and the mixing between the primary jet and surrounding flow is better. A low-velocity region or external recirculation zone (ERZ) form near the kiln upper wall and shrink with increased nozzle diameter or decreased initial Reynolds number. The ERZ may stabilize the flame since it is a low-velocity region and consequently attract the jet to reside predominantly in it or in the shear layer. As a conclusion, by enlarging the jet exit diameter, the jet can be prolonged, while to a certain extent, the benefit from the ERZ would need to be sacrificed. Since the asymmetric development and the ERZ in the kiln were not studied during the previous PIV measurement campaign, more experimental studies are planned to provide more experimental evidences of the details of the flow and to lay grounds for validation of the CFD simulation results...|$|E
