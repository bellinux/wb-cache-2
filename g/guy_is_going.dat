500|$|After signing his contract, Rivera—who spoke no English and {{had never}} left home—flew to the United States and {{reported}} to the [...] Gulf Coast League (GCL) Yankees, a Rookie level minor league affiliate of the New York Yankees. Feeling lonely and homesick, he wrote home to his parents often, as {{they did not have}} access to telephones in Puerto Caimito. At that point in his career, scouts considered Rivera to be a [...] "fringe prospect" [...] at best, but he made progress with a strong 1990 season for the GCL Yankees. Pitching mostly in relief, he allowed only 24baserunners and one earned run in 52innings pitched—a 0.17earned run average (ERA). The team permitted Rivera to start the season's final game in order for him to accumulate enough innings pitched to qualify for the league's ERA title (which carried a $500 bonus); his subsequent seven-inning no-hitter [...] "put him on the map with the organization", according to manager Glenn Sherlock. In the offseason, Rivera returned to Panama, where a tip from him to Raybourn led to the Yankees signing a promising local 16-year-old player, Rivera's cousin Rubén. In 1991, Mariano was promoted to the Class A level Greensboro Hornets of the South Atlantic League, where he started 15 of the 29 games he pitched in. Despite a 4–9win–loss record, he recorded a 2.75ERA in innings pitched and struck out 123batters while walking 36batters. New York Yankees manager Buck Showalter took notice of Rivera's strong strikeout-to-walk ratio, calling it [...] "impressive in any league" [...] and saying, [...] "This <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to make it." ...|$|E
500|$|Long-time {{collaborators}} {{and veteran}} Disney writers, Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle {{had already been}} writing for Disney Channel for several years, contributing to the network's male-led animated series Aladdin, Hercules and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, each one spin-offs of their respective feature-length animated films. Although they had enjoyed working on those projects, Schooley and McCorkle were becoming interested in contributing to [...] "something original". At the same time, the writers learned that Disney Channel had become interested in developing a show featuring ordinary children in extraordinary circumstances. Thus, the network commissioned Schooley and McCorkle to create an animated series geared towards the nine to 14 year-old demographic that was also capable of entertaining older audiences at the same time. While traveling in an elevator {{on their way back}} to their office from their lunch break, McCorkle said to Schooley, [...] "Kim Possible. She can do anything", to which Schooley responded, [...] "Ron Stoppable, he can’t", and nearly the entire premise of Kim Possible naturally unfolded thereafter. According to Schooley and McCorkle, both lead characters' names indicate that Kim Possible [...] "is going to be an arched show that is a little bit over the top, but also that the girl {{is going to be the}} action lead and the <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be funny." [...] Conceiving all main characters themselves, Rufus and Wade were eventually created and added to the roster, but the series essentially remains about Kim [...] "who is incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world" [...] while [...] "Ron would be challenged everywhere." ...|$|E

500|$|Chamberlain was in {{his third}} season in the NBA, having set season scoring records {{in each of his}} first two seasons with 37.6 and then 38.4 points per game. [...] Frank McGuire, the Warriors' new coach, started the season vowing to get the ball to Chamberlain [...] "two-thirds of the time." [...] Sports Illustrated wrote that McGuire's [...] "eventual effect may be to measurably change the {{character}} of professional basketball from the brawling, hustling, cigar-in-the-face and eye-on-the-till game it has been for decades to the major league sport which it longs and deserves to be." [...] He was determined to play Chamberlain every minute of every game; the [...] and [...] center had missed only eight minutes and 33 seconds that season due to disqualification in a game from technical fouls. In three earlier games that week, Chamberlain had scored 67, 65, and 61 points respectively, giving him an already-record 15 times scoring 60 or more points in his career. He was closing in on 4,000 points for the season, needing 237 more; no other player had ever scored 3,000 points at that point. On December 8, 1961, in a triple overtime game versus the Los Angeles Lakers, he set a new NBA record by scoring 78 points, breaking the record of 71 previously set by Elgin Baylor. Legendary Laker broadcaster Chick Hearn often told the story that after the game, he asked Baylor if it bothered him that Chamberlain had an extra 15 minutes to break the record. According to Hearn, Baylor said he wasn't concerned because [...] "someday that <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to score 100". Rival center Bill Russell predicted, [...] " [...] has the size, strength, and stamina to score one hundred some night." [...] In a high school game in 1955, Chamberlain had scored 90points in a 123–21 victory. The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, [...] "Chamberlain might have hit 100 if he had played the entire 32 minutes." ...|$|E
