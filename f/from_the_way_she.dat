She played an engaged woman who develops a one-sided attraction to her commitment-phobic co-worker. Khan said about Kapoor's craft, [...] "We'd be shooting {{a scene from}} multiple angles—for {{three or four hours}} you're doing the same scene, the same lines—and here is this person [...] who brings consistency to her work, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> talks, to her accent." [...] Although Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express called Kapoor's performance [...] "stiff and rehearsed", Daily News and Analysis Johnson Thomas found her [...] "likeable and believable". I Hate Luv Storys was Kapoor's first commercial success, earning [...] worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Newkirk is well read, {{and she can}} be witty. When she is not proselytizing, denouncing, or {{attacking the}} ninety-nine per cent of {{humanity}} that sees the world differently <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> does, she is good company. After years of detestable public behavior, however, she has the popular image of a monster. Whenever I mentioned her name to friends, they would recoil. And she becomes more disliked with every peta stunt; she can't walk through an airport without accosting any woman who is wearing fur. She no longer takes vacations in tropical or poor countries like Mexico, because [...] "I spend the whole time rescuing animals from their horrid owners." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{philosophical}} {{work was}} influenced by Simone Weil (from whom she borrows the concept of 'attention'), and by Plato, under whose banner she claimed to fight. In re-animating Plato, she gives force {{to the reality of}} the Good, and to a sense of the moral life as a pilgrimage from illusion to reality. [...] From this perspective, Murdoch's work offers perceptive criticism of Kant, Sartre and Wittgenstein ('early' and 'late'). [...] Her most central parable, which appears in The Sovereignty of Good, asks us (in Nussbaum's succinct account), [...] "to imagine a mother-in-law, M, who has contempt for D, her daughter-in-law. M sees D as common, cheap, low. Since M is a self-controlled Englishwoman, she behaves (so Murdoch stipulates) with perfect graciousness all the while, and no hint of her real view surfaces in her acts. But she realizes, too, that her feelings and thoughts are unworthy, and likely to be generated by jealousy and an excessively keen desire to hang on to her son. So she sets herself a moral task: she will change her view of D, making it more accurate, less marred by selfishness. She gives herself exercises in vision: where she is inclined to say 'coarse,' she will say, and see, 'spontaneous.' Where she is inclined to say 'common,' she will say, and see, 'fresh and naive.' As time goes on, the new images supplant the old. Eventually M does not have to make such an effort to control her actions: they flow naturally <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> has come to see D." [...] This is how M cultivates a pattern of behavior that leads her to view D [...] "justly or lovingly". [...] The parable is partly meant to show (against Oxford contemporaries including R. M. Hare and Stuart Hampshire) the importance of the 'inner' life to moral action. [...] Seeing another aright can depend on overcoming jealousy, and discoveries about the world involve inner work.|$|E
5000|$|Finally in [...] "Aux sources du Z" [...] as Spirou {{uses the}} time shifter {{to get back}} to the events of [...] "La corne de rhinocéros", he {{encounters}} Seccotine wandering around their yard waiting to snap pictures of the brand new Turbot he and Fantasio had just received. Seccotine notes how different Spirou acts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she's</b> gotten to know him, he's far more like a man, a fact that she deems not to be all that unpleasant. To silence her Spirou kisses her on the mouth which leaves her frozen in surprise.

When asked who out of Lucas, EJ or Rafe should be with Sami, Sweeney said [...] "You can't ask that," [...] because [...] "that is one topic I am now scared to talk about because you say one thing and the fans get all kinds of crazy on you."

50|$|Having fought {{so hard to}} make Ismail II king of the Safavid dynasty, Pari Khan Khanum was now {{met with}} lack of {{gratitude}} <b>from</b> him. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> was treated by Ismail II made her hostile towards him, and made her prepare to exact vengeance. On 25 November 1577, Ismail II died abruptly and without any initial signs of bad health.

60|$|Kurrell endures {{anything}} that Boulte may say to him. Sometimes they are away {{for three days}} together, and then the Major insists upon his wife going over to sit with Mrs. Boulte; although Mrs. Vansuythen has repeatedly declared that she prefers her husband's company to any in <b>the</b> world. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>she</b> clings to him, she would certainly seem to be speaking the truth.|$|R
60|$|She was {{not merely}} playing mental whist. She {{was trying to keep}} <b>from</b> worry.

On this eastern side of the pass, the new road was not open; there was a tortuous, flint-scattered trail, too narrow, in most places, for the passing of other cars.

60|$|Well, {{that was}} something, of course. Nevertheless, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> spoke, it {{certainly}} {{looked as if}} poor old Gussie might as well scratch his name off the entry list, and I didn't {{at all like the}} prospect of having to break the bad news to him.

60|$|In this respect, indeed, Archie {{needed no}} stimulant.

But enough {{is as good as}} a feast, and when once I get you abroad {{together}}--!"

60|$|Philip lay, with closed eyes, as if {{in severe}} pain: and Charles, afraid to disturb him, sat feeling {{as if it was}} a dream. That he, with Amy and her child, should be in Guy's home, so {{differently}} from their old plans, so very differently <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> should have arrived. He looked round the room, and everywhere knew what Guy's taste had prepared for his bride--piano, books, prints, similarities to Hollywell, all with a fresh new bridal effect, inexpressibly melancholy. They brought a thought of the bright eye, sweet voice, light step, and merry whistle; and as he said to himself 'gone for ever,' he could have hated Philip, but for the sight of his haggard features, gray hairs, and the deep lines which, at seven-and-twenty, sorrow had traced on his brow. At length Philip turned and looked up.|$|E
6000|$|Irksome as {{all this}} {{necessarily}} {{was to a}} man of taste, I suffered still more acutely when we reached our destination, where disagreeable circumstances compelled me to drink tea with a waiter's family. William knew that I regarded thanks from persons of his class as an outrage, yet he looked them though he dared not speak them. Hardly had {{he sat down at}} the table by my orders than he remembered that I was a member of the club and jumped up. Nothing is in worse form than whispering, yet again and again he whispered to his poor, foolish wife, [...] "How are you now? You don't feel faint?"

40|$|In her spiritual autobiography, Memoirs of the Life, Religious Experience, Ministerial Travels and Labors of Mrs. Zilpha Elaw (1846), Zilpha Elaw {{discusses}} {{her early}} childhood experiences with religion in Pennsylvania. Mrs. Elaw eventually became an itinerant preacher in the evangelical {{tradition of the}} African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church. Although Elaw was an evangelist influenced by the cultural/spiritual forces surrounding her, she was not in lock step with the founding fathers of the AME Church. In her spiritual autobiography, much of her account of her preaching and teaching emerges from her own particular life circumstances in relationship to her gender and position as a black woman in mid-nineteenth century America. In this presentation, I contextualize the political/social protest in Mrs. Elaw’s autobiography within the negotiated tensions with the dominant white culture, within the texts that structure {{the beginnings of the}} AME Church, and within proscriptions about appropriate gender roles within the Church. I argue that Mrs. Elaw was resolute in using prophesy and evangelism to protest political realities and encourage action running against the grain of popular thought, both in the dominant white culture and in her own African American community. In this process, she stood resolutely for what she believed was morally and scripturally correct–that women could and should preach the gospel and that African American people should stand resolute for moral political and social action, exhorting her reading audience to become galvanized to this end. Elaw’s position emerges <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>she</b> reports her practice of everyday life. Michel de Certeau’s theoretical framework developed in The Practice of Everyday Life (1984) is useful in describing her call for resistance/protest as one triply outside the realm of power [by virtue of her being 1) a person of color; 2) a woman; and 3) an evangelist]. She made use of the discourses of the dominant {{in order to create a}} sphere of autonomy to evangelize political and social change. Mrs. Elaw’s Christian rhetoric will be analyzed through John Wesley’s holistic understanding of Christianity, through the lens of what is now known as the “Wesleyan quadrilateral” (tradition, reason, experience, and scripture) ...|$|R
