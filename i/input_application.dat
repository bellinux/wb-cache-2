50|$|The BMDFM dynamic {{scheduling}} subsystem is {{an efficient}} SMP emulator of the tagged-token dataflow machine. The Shared Memory Pool is divided in three main parts: Input/Output Ring Buffer Port (IORBP), Data Buffer (DB) and Operation Queue (OQ). The Front-end Control Virtual Machine schedules an <b>input</b> <b>application</b> program statically and puts clustered instructions and {{data of the}} input program into the IORBP. The ring buffer service processes (IORBP PROC) move data into the DB and instructions into the OQ. The operation queue service processes (OQ PROC) tag the instructions as ready for execution if the required operands' data is accessible. Execution processes (CPU PROC) execute instructions, which are tagged as ready and output computed data into the DB or to the IORBP. Additionally, IORBP PROC and OQ PROC are responsible for freeing memory after contexts have been processed. The context is a special unique identifier representing a copy of data within different iteration bodies accordingly to the tagged-token dataflow architecture. This allows the dynamic scheduler to handle several iterations in parallel.|$|E

Synthesis of the hardware component involves designing a custom circuit for the hardware portion of the <b>input</b> <b>application.</b> Synthesis of the software component consists of designing a processor that is suited for the software portion of the <b>input</b> <b>application</b> and generating code that implements the functionality of the software component on the designed processor. Short design cycles and increasing embedded system complexity make it impractical to perform manual processor architecture exploration and code generation.

Given the inherent complementarities between labor and nutrient supply during critical phases of the plant growth process, input efficiency strongly depends on labor use. We present a semiparametric bioeconomic modeling approach to analyze the available options for improving input efficiency in agricultural production. Input response equations are used that consider the returns per unit of land and labor as a function of specific combinations of material inputs and management practices. Critical trade-offs may arise when opportunity costs for labor are considered or when complementary factors appear as binding constraints. The model enables assessment of feasible pathways for enhancing sustainable intensification and poverty alleviation in typical settings of the East African highland regio...|$|R
40|$|A large-grain level mapping {{method is}} {{presented}} of numerical oriented applications onto multiprocessor systems. The method {{is based on}} the large-grain data flow representation of the <b>input</b> <b>application</b> and it assumes a general interconnection topology of the multiprocessor system. The large-grain data flow model was used because such representation best exhibits inherited parallelism in many important applications, e. g., CFD models based on partial differential equations can be presented in large-grain data flow format, very effectively. A generalized interconnection topology of the multiprocessor architecture is considered, including such architectural issues as interprocessor communication cost, with the aim to identify the 'best matching' between the application and the multiprocessor structure. The objective is to minimize the total execution time of the input algorithm running on the target system. The mapping strategy consists of the following: (1) large-grain data flow graph generation from the <b>input</b> <b>application</b> using compilation techniques; (2) data flow graph partitioning into basic computation blocks; and (3) physical mapping onto the target multiprocessor using a priority allocation scheme for the computation blocks...|$|E
