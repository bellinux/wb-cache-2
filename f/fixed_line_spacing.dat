40|$|Inkjet {{printing}} {{has been}} actively pursued {{as a means}} of realizing integrated electronic devices. To date, the vast majority of work on this topic has centered on the development of inks and process integration, while little research has focused on the details of pattern generation. In this work, we first examine inkjet-printed conductive lines. We show several different printed-line morphologies and explain the causes of these forms of varying utility. More generally, we develop and demonstrate a methodology to optimize the raster-scan printing of patterned, two-dimensional films. We show that any <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> <b>spacing</b> can not maintain the constant perimeter contact angle necessary for arbitrary patterned footprints. We propose and demonstrate a printing algorithm that adjusts line spacing to print optimal features. Our work analyzing patterned drops reveals that drop contact angle is a function of position and shape. Numerical solutions to the Young-Laplace equation enable us to predict the sharpest corners possible in a rectangular bead with a given wetting behavior. We verify our computational results with printed rectangles on substrates with variable wetting. Finally, we motivate future research directions including general solutions to a patterned drop's surface in any corner and the behavior of line junctions and other concave corners of printed lines...|$|E

40|$|The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) {{finds itself}} in a {{telecommunications}} landscape that is going through significant change, with new converging technologies and the roll out of major infrastructure. Investments in mobile infrastructure have greatly {{reduced the number of}} complaints about mobile services. At the same time, a transition to the National Broadband Network (NBN) is creating new challenges in the <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> <b>space,</b> with issues emerging out of the accelerated rollout of this significant project to replace ageing infrastructure. These changes are creating a volatile demand environment for the TIO and an evolving complaint profile. New complaints reached their lowest level in nine years in the December 2015 quarter. In subsequent quarters, new complaints began to increase, with more issues about <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> services and a higher proportion of small business complaints. Complaints about <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> services and business complaints are generally more complex, requiring more time and more technical knowledge to resolve.  ...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} {{formalism}} of 4 D symplectic mappings to analyse the betatronic motion {{in a circular}} hadron collider; different methods {{for the evaluation of}} the nonlinear frequencies are considered, and the usefulness of the analysis of the motion in the frequency space is underlined. Some analytical tools based on the perturbative theory of normal forms are sketched: the nonresonant formalism allows one to determine analytical expressions for the invariants, for the tunes, and for the distortion functions; the resonant formalism allows one to analyse the geometry of resonant orbits, evaluate the position and the stability of fixed points and <b>fixed</b> <b>lines</b> in phase <b>space.</b> The analytical and numerical approaches are shown to be complementary tools {{for the study of the}} dynamics. INTRODUCTION In the last decade, the introduction of superconducting magnets with intrinsically nonlinear fields has raised new interest for nonlinear dynamics in accelerator physics (1).

40|$|Abstract. We study semistable pairs on {{elliptic}} K 3 surfaces with a section. For {{a suitable}} {{choice of the}} framing, we get a family of projective moduli spaces related by wall crossing phenomena. We describe such phenomena and we get in a particular case a result by Friedman, giving an isomorphism between a four dimensional moduli space of rank 2 semistable sheaves {{on the surface and}} the four dimensional Hilbert scheme. In this paper we study moduli spaces of pairs (V, α) where V is a coherent sheaf of rank two on an elliptic K 3 surface and α a morphism to a <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> bundle. Moduli <b>spaces</b> of pairs have been used in other contexts to resolve birational maps between different moduli spaces of sheaves [GöHu]. Let us consider a smooth projective elliptic K 3 surface π: S → P 1 with a section σ. Denote by f the generic fiber and let t be a nonnegative integer. Friedman studied in [Fr] stability of rank 2 vector bundles on S. He proved in particular that the moduli spac...|$|R

50|$|If σ is a collineation of a {{projective}} plane, a point P with P = Pσ {{is called}} a fixed point of σ, and a line m with m = mσ {{is called a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> of σ. The points on a <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> need not be fixed points, their images under σ are just constrained to lie on this line. The collection of fixed points and <b>fixed</b> <b>lines</b> of a collineation form a closed configuration, which is a system of points and lines that satisfy the first two but not necessarily the third condition {{in the definition of}} a projective plane. Thus, the fixed point and <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> structure for any collineation either form a projective plane by themselves, or a degenerate plane. Collineations whose fixed structure forms a plane are called planar collineations.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how the market {{potential}} for internet services interacted historically with the diffusion process of <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> and mobile telephony. Design/methodology/approach – The authors evaluate the historical interactions between internet, <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> and mobile telephony using the International Telecommunications Union data set from 1991 until 2003 for 214 countries. Findings – It was found that between 1991 and 2003 mobile and internet services were fully complementary; <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> facilitated the diffusion of internet service, but internet diffusion did not affect <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> telephony. The authors discuss the implications of these results in the light of current developments of the telecommunications industry. Research limitations/implications – Internet adoption should be analysed in close relation to the adoption of other telecommunication services, such as <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> and mobile telephony. Originality/value – The paper shows the interconnectivity of the internet with other telecommunication services and emphasizes the asymmetric nature of these interactions. Telecommunication services interactions are discussed in the light of recent industry developments...|$|R

40|$|The {{internet}} {{has become an}} extremely important modern day technology for business and {{made a lot of}} activities very easy. It is used for almost all purposes, even with important issues such as in education and government organizations. In view of these benefits, various technologies have been developed to connect users to the internet. Some of these technologies include dial up, ISDN, DSL, satellite and mobile broadband. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to find the causes of low patronage of <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> broadband internet access (DSL using landline) among households in Ghana. The paper employs qualitative research design whilst the survey method (both interview and questionnaire) was applied as the data collection methodology. The main findings were that most educated people in Ghana are computer and internet literates and perceive the internet as important. It was also found that many people are of the view that <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> broadband internet access is expensive and slow. More importantly, most people are ignorant about <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> broadband internet access and do not know the advantages that <b>fixed</b> <b>line</b> broadband internet access has over its competitors.
