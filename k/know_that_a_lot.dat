2500|$|In 1990, Jones {{released}} his last proper studio album on Epic, You Oughta Be Here With Me. [...] Although the album featured several stirring performances, including the lead single [...] "Hell Stays Open All Night Long" [...] and the Roger Miller-penned title song, the single did poorly and Jones made {{the switch to}} MCA, ending his relationship with Sherrill and what was now Sony Music after 19 years. [...] His first album with MCA, And Along Came Jones, was released in 1991 and, backed by MCA's powerful promotion team and producer Kyle Lehning (who had produced a string of hit albums for Randy Travis), the album sold better than his previous one had. [...] However, two singles, [...] "You Couldn't Get The Picture" [...] and [...] "She Loved A Lot In Her Time" [...] (a tribute to Jones' mother Clara), did not crack the top 30 on the charts as Jones lost favor with country radio as the format was altered radically during the early 1990s. [...] His last album to have significant radio airplay was 1992's Walls Can Fall, which featured the novelty song [...] "Finally Friday" [...] and [...] "I Don't Need Your Rockin' Chair," [...] a testament to his continued vivaciousness in old age. [...] Despite the lack of radio airplay, Jones continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s and {{was inducted into the}} Country Music Hall of Fame by Randy Travis in 1992. [...] In 1996, Jones {{released his}} autobiography I Lived To Tell It All with Tom Carter and the irony of his long career was not lost on him, with the singer writing in its preface, [...] "I also <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of my show-business peers are going to be angry after reading this book. [...] So many have worked so hard to maintain their careers. [...] I never took my career seriously, and yet it's flourishing." [...] He also pulled no punches about his disappointment in the direction country music had taken, devoting a full chapter to the changes in the country music scene of the 1990s that saw him removed from radio playlists in favor of a younger generation of pop-influenced country stars. (Jones had long been a critic of country pop, and along with Wynette and Jean Shepard, {{he was one of the}} major backers of the Association of Country Entertainers, a guild promoting traditional country sounds that was founded in 1974; Jones's divorce from Wynette was a factor in the Association's collapse.) Despite his absence from the country charts during this time, latter-day country superstars such as Garth Brooks, Randy Travis, Alan Jackson, and many others often paid tribute to Jones while expressing their love and respect for his legacy as a true country legend who paved the way for their own success. [...] On February 17, 1998, The Nashville Network premiered a group of television specials called The George Jones Show, with Jones as host. [...] The program featured informal chats with Jones holding court with country's biggest stars old and new and, of course, music. [...] Guests included Loretta Lynn, Trace Adkins, Johnny Paycheck, Lorrie Morgan, Merle Haggard, Billy Ray Cyrus, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Charley Pride, Bobby Bare, Patty Loveless and Waylon Jennings, among others.|$|E

Concerning the latter, it is well <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of expressions in such languages as Russian with its free word order are constructed syntactically according to excessively loose rules.
