These, however, are the merest small fraction of our infant mortality. It leaves untouched {{the fact that a}} vast multitude of children of untainted blood and good mental and moral possibilities, as many, perhaps, as 100 in each 1,000 born, die yearly through insufficient food, insufficient good air, and insufficient attention. The plain and simple truth is that they are born needlessly. There are still too many births for our civilisation to look after, we are still unfit to be trusted with a rising birth-rate. [Footnote: It is a digression from the argument of this Paper, but I would like to point out here a very popular misconception about the birth-rate which needs exposure. It is known that the birth-rate is falling in all European countries--a fall which has a very direct relation to a rise in the mean standard of comfort and the average age at marriage--and alarmists foretell a time when nations will be extinguished through this decline. They ascribe it to a certain decay in religious faith, to the advance of science and scepticism, and so forth; it is a part, they say, of a general demoralization. The thing is a popular cant and quite unsupported by facts. The <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth-rate</b> is--so far as England and Wales goes--partly a real decline due to a decline in gross immorality, partly to a real decline due to the later age at which women marry, and partly a statistical decline due to an increased proportion of people too old or too young for child-bearing. Wherever the infant mortality is falling there is an apparent misleading fall in the birth-rate due to the [...] "loading" [...] of the population with children. Here are the sort of figures that are generally given. They are the figures for England and Wales for two typical periods.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} how Japanese parenting magazines portray parenting and gender roles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sh≈çshika era, {{an era of}} sustained <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Japanese <b>birth-rate.</b> Recent surveys indicate that Japanese society remains ambivalent {{about the need for}} fathers to be involved in child rearing. This {{article examines}} why these attitudes and ideas persist and how the Japanese media, specifically Japanese parenting magazines, may contribute to perpetuating traditional attitudes towards parenting roles. The article explores how parenting is represented in text and visual elements of contemporary popular parenting magazines, with comparisons made between the distinct approaches of selected Japanese and English-language parenting magazines. The findings indicate that narrow and stereotypical representations of mothers and fathers remain common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Japanese parenting magazines. The findings also highlight the lack of visibility of the social context within which parenting occurs, with parenting represented as a largely individual-level experience. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>the</b> English-language parenting magazines depict a more diverse range of social issues of relevance to parenting, a more diverse range of family structures, and greater involvement of fathers in parenting compared to Japanese parenting magazines...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that, in estimating secular trends ofcancer mortality, {{the changing}} age-structure {{of the population}} {{must be taken into}} account. In England and Wales the proportion of the population in the older age groups has been steadily increasing; for example, in 1956 - 59, 53 per cent. of the female population were over 35 years of age, as compared with 41 per cent. in 1921 - 25. This increase is attri-butable to two causes: first, the falling mortality in lower age groups consequent upon improvements in public health and the treatment of infectious diseases; secondly, the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth-rate</b> which took place between 1901 and 1931.

Comparisons of the crude death-rate as between one people and another or one year and another, give no information, without further knowledge or further inquiry, as to whether one people is healthier than another or whether health conditions have improved over a period. The {{reason is that the}} crude death-rate is chiefly influenced by the age distribution of <b>the</b> people. <b>In</b> 1936, 45 per cent of all deaths in Eire were of persons aged 65 years and over, and infant mortality is also very high as compared with mortality at most other ages.

6000|$|The {{reasons for}} <b>the</b> fall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth-rate</b> are obvious enough. It is a {{necessary}} consequence of the individualistic competition of modern life. People talk of modern women [...] "shirking" [...] motherhood, {{but it would be}} a silly sort of universe in which a large proportion of women had any natural and instinctive desire to shirk motherhood, and, I believe, a huge proportion of modern women are as passionately predisposed towards motherhood as ever women were. But modern conditions conspire to put a heavy handicap upon parentage and an enormous premium upon the partial or complete evasion of offspring, and that is where the clue to the trouble lies. Our social arrangements discourage parentage very heavily, and the rational thing for a statesman to do <b>in</b> <b>the</b> matter is not to grow eloquent, but to do intelligent things to minimise that discouragement.|$|R

[...] I confess to approaching this subject {{from the point of view}} of the infant citizen rather than of the Empire. And I have wondered sometimes if it is worth while to save the babies, seeing the conditions they often have to face as grown men and women. But that, after all, would be to throw up the sponge, which is not the part of a Briton. It is written also:--"After the war a very large increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth-rate</b> may be looked for." [...] For a year or two, perhaps; but the real after-effect of the war will be to decrease <b>the</b> <b>birth-rate</b> <b>in</b> every European country, or I am much mistaken. [...] "No food for cannon, and no extra burdens," [...] will be the cry. And little wonder! This, however, does not affect the question of children actually born or on their way. If not quantity, we can at all events have quality.|$|R

Suffice it, that now all the tendency is back towards restraints upon increase, to an increasing celibacy, to a fall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth-rate</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> average size of families, to--to a release of women from an entire devotion to a numerous offspring, and so at last to the supersession of those little family units that for four centuries have made up the substance of social life and determined nearly all our moral and sentimental attitudes. The autonomy of the family is being steadily destroyed, and it is being replaced by the autonomy of <b>the</b> individual <b>in</b> relation to some syndicated economic effort." ...|$|R

By such expedients we may hope to see, first, a certain fall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth-rate,</b> a fall chiefly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth-rate</b> of improvident, vicious, and feeble types, a continuation, in fact, of that fall that is already so conspicuous in illegitimate births in Great Britain; secondly, a certain, almost certainly more considerable fall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> death-rate of infants and young children, and that fall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infantile death-rate will serve to indicate, thirdly, a fall no statistics will fully demonstrate in what I may call the partial death-rate, the dwarfing and limiting of that innumerable host of children who do, in an underfed, meagre sort of a way, survive. This raising of the standard of homes will do a work that will not end with the children; the death-line will sag downward for all the first twenty or thirty years of life. Dull- minded, indolent, prosperous people will say that all this {{is no more than a}} proposal to make man better by machinery, that you cannot reform the world by Board of Trade Regulations and all the rest of it. They will say that such work as this is a scheme of grim materialism, and that the Soul of Man gains no benefit by this [...] "so-called Progress," [...] that it is not birth-rates that want raising but Ideals. We shall deal later with Ideals in general. Here I will mention only one, and that is, unhappily, only an Ideal Argument. I wish I could get together all these people who are so scornful of materialistic things, out of the excessively comfortable houses they inhabit, and I wish I could concentrate them in a good typical East London slum--five or six together in each room, one lodging with another, and I wish I could leave them there to demonstrate the superiority of high ideals to purely material considerations for the rest of their earthly career while we others went on with our sordid work unencumbered by their ideality.|$|R
60|$|The vast {{bulk of the}} {{population}} of the United States has, in fact, only got there from Europe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of the last hundred years, and mainly since the accession of Queen Victoria to the throne of Great Britain. That is the first fact that the student of the American social future must realise. Only an extremely small proportion of its blood goes back now to those who fought for freedom <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days of George Washington. The American community is not an expanded colonial society that has become autonomous. It is a great and deepening pool of population accumulating upon the area these predecessors freed, and since fed copiously by affluents from every European community. Fresh ingredients are still being added in enormous quantity, in quantity so great as to materially change <b>the</b> racial quality <b>in</b> a score of years. It is particularly noteworthy that each accession of new blood seems to sterilise its predecessors. Had there been no immigration at all into the United States, but had the rate of increase that prevailed in 1810-20 prevailed to 1900, {{the population}}, which would then have been a purely native American one, would have amounted to a hundred million--that is to say, to approximately nine million <b>in</b> excess of <b>the</b> present total population. The new waves are for a time amazingly fecund, and then comes a rapid fall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth-rate.</b> <b>The</b> proportion of colonial and early republican blood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> population is, therefore, probably far smaller even than the figures I have quoted would suggest.|$|R
