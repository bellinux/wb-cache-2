5|$|A. n. punicus, {{described}} by Erlanger in 1897, is resident in north-west Africa, {{north of the}} Sahara. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to nisus, being large and pale.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the main stand <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to the one at Springfield Park, former home of Wigan Athletic. This was also built in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{community}} and ecology <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> {{to that of}} other Cambrian localities, suggesting a global pool of species that repopulated localities after calamitous burial events occurred.|$|E
30|$|Crack {{patterns}} <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> for replicate identical shear {{beams and}} <b>were</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> for the VC and SCC beams. The diagonal crack widths constant for identical shear and flexural beams indicate {{the consistency of}} the test results.|$|R

5|$|Boletus reticulatus <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to B.aereus, also {{occurring}} {{during the}} summer months under broad-leaved trees. It has a paler, often cracked cap and a usually paler stipe covered in a more elaborate and pronounced whitish reticulation, often extending to the stipe base.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{behavior}} {{between males}} {{has been reported}} {{on a number of}} occasions, and <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> in form to that seen in many other viperid species. An important factor in sexual selection, it allows for the establishment and recognition of dominance as males compete for access to sexually active females.|$|E
5|$|Low-speed (LS) rate of 1.5Mbit/s {{is defined}} by USB1.0. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to full-bandwidth {{operation}} except each bit takes 8 times as long to transmit. It is intended primarily to save cost in low-bandwidth human interface devices (HID) such as keyboards, mice, and joysticks.|$|E
50|$|Their formats <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to {{civilian}} plates.|$|R
50|$|Marine {{biologist}} Amélie H. Scheltema et al. (2003) {{argued that}} Wiwaxia’s feeding apparatus <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to the radulas of some modern shell-less aplacophoran molluscs, {{and that the}} sclerites {{of the two groups}} <b>are</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar.</b> They concluded that Wiwaxia {{was a member of a}} clade that includes molluscs.|$|R

5|$|Pluteus aurantiorugosus <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to P.nevadensis in {{external}} appearance, {{and the two}} {{can only}} be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics or DNA sequence. In contrast to the latter species, the former has oblong spores, and cystidia that are shorter and less slender. P.aurantiorugosus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but rare.|$|E
5|$|The black-{{shoulder}}ed kite <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to the related raptor species, the letter-winged kite (E.scriptus) {{but has the}} black mark above and behind the eye, a white rather than grey crown, and shows all-white underparts in flight except for the black patch at the shoulder and dark wingtips.|$|E
5|$|A. n. nisosimilis was {{described}} by Samuel Tickell in 1833. It breeds from central and eastern Siberia east to Kamchatka and Japan, and south to northern China. This subspecies is wholly migratory, wintering from Pakistan and India eastwards through South-East Asia and southern China to Korea and Japan; some even reach Africa. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to, but slightly larger than, the nominate subspecies.|$|E

5|$|A.× cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), {{a hybrid}} between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, was first {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845. Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings {{are known to}} have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. At the time it was regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to A.sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} mammals, {{domestic}} sheep reproduction occurs sexually. Their reproductive strategy <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to other domestic herd animals. A {{flock of sheep}} is generally mated by a single ram, which has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams (in feral populations). Most sheep have a breeding season (tupping) in the autumn, though some are able to breed year-round.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra esculenta has a {{wrinkled}} surface (similar to brainlike convolutions), not wavy or bumpy like G.infula. Gyromitra ambigua <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> in appearance, {{and although it}} is usually not possible to discern between the two species without examining microscopic characteristics, G.ambigua {{is said to have}} more pronounced purple tints in the stipe. G.ambigua has larger spores that are about 22–30µm long. The saddle-shaped cap of G.infula might also lead to confusion with some species of Helvella, but these latter fungi typically have grayer colors and thinner, fluted stipes.|$|E
50|$|Of these, average {{sentence}} lengths can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> {{in works}} of different authors or vary significantly even {{within a single}} work; average word lengths likewise turn out to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> in works of different authors. Analysis of function words shows promise because they are used by authors unconsciously.|$|R

5|$|In {{much of its}} range, Eurasian is {{the only}} {{nuthatch}} present. In southeast Europe and southwest Asia, the western and eastern rock nuthatches are larger and paler than the Eurasian species. They also lack white spots in the tail and are usually found in a different, stony habitat, and Krüper's nuthatch is small and has a black cap and reddish breast patch. In southwest China, the chestnut-vented nuthatch <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to the European bird, but is darker above, has less white on the face and has greyer underparts.|$|E
5|$|Jagaddhatri Puja {{is celebrated}} {{on the last}} four days of the Navaratis, {{following}} Kali Puja. It <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to Durga Puja in its details and observance, and is especially popular in Bengal and some other parts of Eastern India. Gauri Puja is performed {{on the fifth day}} after Ganesh Chaturthi, during Ganesha Puja in Western India, to celebrate the arrival of Gauri, Mother of Ganesha where she brings her son back home.|$|E
5|$|Limusaurus {{has several}} {{features}} of the head in common with basal theropods such as other ceratosaurs and coelophysoids, but it also convergently shares a number of traits, including the beak and the fused sternum, with the later coelurosaurs. The overall aspect of the animal, including the long neck and legs, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> {{to that of the}} Cretaceous ornithomimid theropods, as well as the Triassic non-dinosaurian archosaur Effigia, representing a significant case of convergent evolution among these three distinct groups of archosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia's cuisine {{reflects}} the multi-ethnic makeup of its population. Many cultures {{from within the}} country and from surrounding regions have greatly influenced the cuisine. Much of the influence comes from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cultures, {{largely due to the}} country being part of the ancient spice route. The cuisine <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> to that of Singapore and Brunei, and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine. The different states have varied dishes, and often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} mammalian {{species can}} be affected by prion diseases, as the prion protein (PrP) <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> in all mammals. Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is unusual for a prion disease to transmit from one species to another. The human prion disease variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, however, {{is believed to be}} caused by a prion that typically infects cattle, causing Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and is transmitted through infected meat.|$|E
5|$|Morchella populiphila is a {{distinct}} morel because of its cap attachment and its habitat, and {{it is unlikely to}} be mistaken for other species. Verpa bohemica is somewhat similar in appearance, but its cap hangs free from attachment to the stipe. The other North American half-free morel, Morchella punctipes, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>similar</b> in appearance to M.populiphila, and they cannot be reliably distinguished on morphology alone. The distribution of M.punctipes extends from the Great Plains eastward. The widespread European species Morchella semilibera is morphologically indistinguishable from M.populiphila, in both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics.|$|E
