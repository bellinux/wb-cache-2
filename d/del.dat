5|$|After World War II ended, <b>del</b> Valle {{was ordered}} back to Headquarters Marine Corps, {{where he was}} named Inspector General, a {{position}} which he held until he retired on January 1, 1948. On February 19, 1946 New Mexico Senator Dennis Chavez and <b>del</b> Valle held a meeting with President Harry S. Truman in the White House, in which Chavez recommended <b>del</b> Valle for the position of governor of Puerto Rico. From 1898 to 1942, the governors of the island were officials appointed by the President of the United States. Local Puerto Rican politicians, such as Luis Muñoz Marín, opposed the naming of <b>del</b> Valle in favor of Jesús T. Piñero; to which <b>del</b> Valle eventually asked President Truman to withdraw his name among those considered for the position. The first civilian and native Puerto Rican appointed governor of Puerto Rico thus became Piñero in 1946. If Congress had not approved legislation in 1947 allowing Puerto Ricans to elect their own Governor, <b>del</b> Valle may have been appointed to the governorship.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, <b>del</b> Potro {{was granted}} a wild card to the US Open. He was drawn against countryman Diego Schwartzman and {{defeated}} him in straight sets. In the second round, he faced and defeated 19th seed and top-ranked American Steve Johnson in straight sets, fighting back from down a break during both {{the first and second}} sets. In the third round, he faced 11th seed and Grand Slam finalist David Ferrer, and again defeated him in straight sets. In the fourth round, he faced 8th seed Dominic Thiem. After <b>del</b> Potro won the first set, the match ended when Thiem retired during the second set. <b>Del</b> Potro then lost to eventual champion Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals in four sets. <b>Del</b> Potro then played against Murray in a rematch of the Olympic final in the Davis Cup. <b>Del</b> Potro won the thrilling 5-set match in 5 hours and 7 minutes. In his next tournament, <b>del</b> Potro played in the 2016 Shanghai Rolex Masters, where he was drawn to play 11th seed David Goffin. Despite being a set and a break up, <b>del</b> Potro eventually lost the match. After this, <b>del</b> Potro was given a wild card into the Stockholm Open. <b>Del</b> Potro beat John Isner, Nicolas Almagro, Ivo Karlovic, and Grigor Dimitrov {{on his way to the}} final. In the final, <b>del</b> Potro cruised to victory over Jack Sock to win his first title since his return from injury. <b>Del</b> Potro then played at the 2016 Swiss Indoors, where he comfortably beat qualifier Robin Haase in the first round. He then got revenge on Goffin in a straight sets win, before falling in 2 tight sets to Kei Nishikori in the quarter finals.|$|E
5|$|All {{four men}} began the SMW Tag Team Championship match in the ring. The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson) {{controlled}} {{most of the}} opening of the match with aerial maneuvers against The Heavenly Bodies (Jimmy <b>Del</b> Ray and Tom Pritchard). <b>Del</b> Ray tried to help his partner but superkicked him instead. The Heavenly Bodies gained the advantage after Pritchard performed a powerbomb on Morton, which <b>Del</b> Ray followed with a moonsault. <b>Del</b> Ray and Morton fought back and forth, with <b>Del</b> Ray performing another moonsault and Morton executing a hurricanrana. After all four wrestlers brawled in the ring once more, <b>Del</b> Ray hit Gibson in the back with a tennis racquet. Pritchard then pinned Gibson to win the belts for The Heavenly Bodies.|$|E

5|$|As {{in falls}} one and two, Guerrero and Hijo <b>del</b> Santo started out against each other. At one point, Guerrero applied Hijo <b>del</b> Santo's own {{submission}} hold, La de a Caballo (camel clutch), {{on him to}} mock his opponent, but {{was not able to}} make Hijo <b>del</b> Santo submit before Octagón saved his partner. Later in the fall, with the referee distracted, Barr was able to surprise Octagón and execute a kneeling reverse piledriver, a move that would have been an automatic disqualification in Lucha Libre. Moments later, Barr was able to pin Octagón to eliminate him from the match. In Lucha Libre, the piledriver is treated as a very dangerous move, something that was sold during this match by Octagón being taken from the arena on a stretcher during the closing moments of the third fall. Minutes later, Hijo <b>del</b> Santo was actually able to kick out of the Superplex/Frog Splash combo by La Pareja <b>del</b> Terror. At one point, both Hijo <b>del</b> Santo and Guerrero were on the floor, which distracted the referee long enough for Blue Panther to enter the ring and perform a piledriver of his own on Barr in retaliation for what was done to Octagón. The move was not seen by the referee but allowed Hijo <b>del</b> Santo to pin Barr, leaving just Hijo <b>del</b> Santo and Guerrero still in the match. A minute or two later, Hijo <b>del</b> Santo was able to roll up Guerrero for the final pinfall and the victory for his team. Following their loss, both Guerrero and Barr visibly cried in the ring, selling the severeness of the loss as they cut off each other's hair with a pair of scissors. This was followed by an AAA official shaving off the rest of their hair with electric clippers backstage.|$|E

This was the first time <b>del</b> Potro had defeated Nadal in five meetings. Despite a loss in the semifinals to Murray, <b>del</b> Potro reached a career-high world ranking of No. 5.|$|E

5|$|Before the season, Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri {{remarked that}} <b>Del</b> Piero would have {{as good a}} season, or an even better one, than the {{previous}} term. In August 2008, <b>Del</b> Piero {{announced that he would}} try to keep playing professional football with Juventus until he turned 40.

Five sampling stations were selected within Lebak <b>Deling</b> swamp area, i. e., Lebak Sebubuk, Lebak Murti, Lebak Serdang, Lebak Purun, and Lubuk <b>Deling.</b> The {{results of this study}} showed that the Lebak <b>Deling</b> swamp was inhabited by nine species of benthic organism, 26 species of zooplankton, 16 species of phytoplankton, 23 species of aquatic plants, 30 species of fishes, three species of reptilians, nine species of birds and six species of mammals. Comparisons in diversity among sampling points were made based on Similarity Index. The analysis indicated that zooplankton and macrobenthic invertebrates had low similarity, while phytoplankton had high similarity. The results of this study confirm that the Lebak <b>Deling</b> swamp is still relatively natural; high diversity in Lebak <b>Deling</b> may be related to permanently submerged, high macrophytes covering and less human intervention...|$|R

5|$|Colonel Pedro <b>del</b> Valle (1893–1978) was the {{commanding}} officer of the 11th Marine Regiment (artillery). Upon the outbreak of World War II, <b>del</b> Valle led his regiment during the seizure and defense of Guadalcanal, providing artillery support for the 1st Marine Division. In the Battle of the Tenaru, the firepower provided by <b>del</b> Valle's artillery units killed many assaulting Japanese soldiers—almost to the last man—before they reached the Marine positions. As {{a result of the}} outcome of the battle the Japanese commander, Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki, committed seppuku shortly afterwards. General Alexander Vandegrift, impressed with <b>del</b> Valle's leadership, recommended his promotion and on October 1, 1942, <b>del</b> Valle became a brigadier general. Vandegrift retained <b>del</b> Valle as head of the 11th Marines, the only time that the 11th Marines has ever had a general as their commanding officer. In 1943, he served as commander of Marine Forces overseeing Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Russell and Florida Islands. Sergeant Silvio Sanguedolce was awarded the Navy Cross for their actions in Guadalcanal.|$|E

On 11 June, <b>Del</b> Piero came on as a substitute for Fiore in the 30th minute in Italy's opening Group B 2–1 win against Turkey, hitting the cross-bar from a free-kick. In the final group game, <b>Del</b> Piero started the match and scored the winner with a notable goal against Sweden, taking it past two players before curling the ball into the top corner from outside the area with a left-footed strike; <b>Del</b> Piero also set up Luigi Di Biagio's opener from a corner. <b>Del</b> Piero made his second start of the tournament for Italy in their semi-final against co-hosts, Netherlands, which Italy won on penalties following a 0–0 draw after extra-time.
