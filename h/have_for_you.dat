500|$|It {{was then}} an annual custom for the Pope {{to receive a}} {{delegation}} from Rome's Jewish community shortly after the New Year. The meeting on 2 February 1859 quickly descended into a heated argument, with Pope Pius berating the Jewish visitors for [...] "stirring up a storm all over Europe about this Mortara case". When the delegation denied that the Jews of Rome had had any hand in the anti-clerical articles, the Pope dismissed Scazzocchio as inexperienced and foolish, then shouted: [...] "The newspapers can write all they want. I couldn't care less what the world thinks!" [...] The Pope then calmed down somewhat: [...] "So strong is the pity I <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> that I pardon you, indeed, I must pardon you." [...] One of the delegates proposed that the Church should not give so much credence to Morisi's testimony, given her spurious morals—the Pope countered that regardless of her character, so {{far as he could}} see the servant had no reason to invent such a story, and in any case Momolo Mortara should not have employed a Catholic in the first place.|$|E

He stated that [...] "it literally pokes fun for not having parents", and stopped playing when he first heard the insult. He added that [...] "it throws the ultimate question that that child {{is ever going to}} <b>have</b> <b>for</b> <b>you...</b> and it just throws it right in the living room." [...] Kotaku's Michael McWhertor felt that while it was [...] "awkward" [...] for the parents, the fact that GLaDOS was trying to kill Chell would be more upsetting. He also pointed out that [...] "morons and the overweight are also mocked by robots" [...] in Portal 2. 1UP.com's Chris Pereira found the joke [...] "harmless".|$|E
