5|$|Sister Peak (Comfortless Cove Hydrothermal <b>Field,</b> , <b>elevation</b> −2996m), Shrimp Farm and Mephisto (Red Lion Hydrothermal <b>Field,</b> , <b>elevation</b> −3047m), {{are three}} {{hydrothermal}} vents {{of the black}} smoker category, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near Ascension Island.

25|$|The TBM 900 model {{features}} several ergonomic improvements within the cockpit, increasing both simplicity and automation.

On the TBM 900, electrical load distribution changes enable the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit to power up in sync with the switch-on of the battery with little battery drain. The G1000 also has upgraded displays, including an ISA temperature deviation indication, integrated weather radar and MFD map, and automatic landing <b>field</b> <b>elevation</b> inputs to the pressurization controller.|$|E

II Geotextiles may control swelling soils that cause considerable damage to America's highways. In 1980, expansive soils caused an estimated $ 7 to $ 9 billion damage in the United States, half occurring on roads, streets and highways. The Texas State Department of Highways and Public Transportation (SDHPT) conducted field testing of early generation fabrics on a San Antonio project.

50|$|The Lockheed L-188 Electra is an American {{turboprop}} airliner {{built by}} Lockheed. First flown in 1957, {{it was the}} first large turboprop airliner built in the United States. Initial sales were good, but after two fatal crashes that led to expensive modifications to fix a design defect, no more were ordered. With its unique high power-to-weight ratio, huge propellers and very short wings (resulting in the majority of the wingspan being enveloped in propwash), large Fowler flaps which significantly increased effective wing area when extended, and four-engined design, the airplane had airfield performance capabilities unmatched by many jet transport aircraft even today—particularly on short runways and high <b>field</b> <b>elevations.</b> Jet airliners soon supplanted turboprops for many purposes, and many Electras were modified as freighters. Some Electras are still being used in various roles into the 21st century. The airframe was also used {{as the basis for the}} much more successful Lockheed P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft.|$|R

50|$|While {{the use of}} a {{barometric}} altimeter setting that provides a zero reading on the ground of the airport is a reference available to pilots, in commercial aviation it is a country-specific procedure that is not often used (it is used, e.g., in Russia, and a few other countries). Most countries (Far East, North and South America, all of Europe, Africa, Australia) use the airport's AMSL (above mean sea level) elevation as a reference. During approaches to landing, there are several other references that are used, including AFE (above <b>field</b> <b>elevation)</b> which is height referencing the highest point on the airfield, TDZE (touchdown zone elevation) or TH (threshold height) which both refer to the elevation of the landing end of the runway measured AMSL and AGL respectively.|$|E
50|$|GRU has two {{parallel}} runways. Runway 09R/27L is 9843 ft long and 148 ft wide, while runway 09L/27R is 12140 ft long and 60 m wide, after being widened in 2015 to better receive the Airbus A380. The <b>field</b> <b>elevation</b> {{at the airport}} is 2459 ft above mean sea level. Runway 09R/27L is used preferentially for landings and runway 09L/27R preferentially for takeoffs, but the Airbus A380 uses the longer and wider latter runway for both landing and taking off. There are high-speed exit taxiways on both runways that allow for traffic to depart the runway at higher speed to allow better efficiency for landing and takeoff traffic. As of 2014, there was an average of 650 takeoff and landing operations per day at the airport.|$|E
