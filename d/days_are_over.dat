2500|$|Anyone is {{permitted}} to possess legally registered or captive-bred raptors, although falconers are anxious {{to point out that}} this is not synonymous with falconry, which specifically entails the hunting of live quarry with a trained bird. [...] A raptor kept merely as a pet or possession, although the law may allow it, is not considered to be a falconer's bird. Birds may be used for breeding or kept after their hunting <b>days</b> <b>are</b> <b>over,</b> but falconers believe it is preferable that young, fit birds are flown at quarry.|$|E

The Sporting News noted the difference in style between Martin and Boros: [...] "The volatile, dirt-kicking <b>days</b> <b>are</b> <b>over</b> for the time being in Oakland. Steve Boros, the man named to succeed Billy Martin, will live on the quiet side of Manager's Row[...] [...] [...] Unlike Martin, Boros said he will not rant and rave.

2500|$|A {{year later}} he reconvened with the Strawberry team, who had by then charted {{with their own}} debut 10cc album, to record The Tra-La <b>Days</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Over</b> for MGM Records, which started {{the second phase of}} his career and {{included}} his original version of the hit song [...] "Love Will Keep Us Together" [...] (also a US No. 1 hit two years later for Captain & Tennille).

[...] The trouble with him was that he had no brain as he himself was concerned. [...] He knew enough to make money for others, but never could make anything for himself. I don’t think that his playing <b>days</b> <b>are</b> <b>over</b> yet, but every club in the league seems inclined to turn him down.
