5|$|The {{variables}} a and b alternate {{holding the}} previous remainders r'k−1 and r'k−2. Assume that a {{is larger than}} b {{at the beginning of}} an iteration; then a equals r'k−2, since r'k−2 > r'k−1. During the loop iteration, a is reduced by multiples of the previous remainder b until a is smaller than b. Then a is the next remainder r'k. Then b is reduced by multiples of a until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>again</b> smaller than a, giving the next remainder r'k+1, and so on.|$|E
5|$|On February 17, 1988, {{the present}} Ven Sayadaw Buddhanta Panya Vamsa of Htilin Monastery and Pitaka Kyaung {{initiated}} {{the ritual of}} daily face washing of the deity at dawn. This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4:30 am when monks wash the face and brush {{the teeth of the}} Buddha image. It is an elaborate ritual performed for over an hour by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire, assisted by several lay helpers, dressed in white and wearing formal headdress. As soon as the drums are struck, the senior monk residing in the adjoining monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh towels, offered by devotees. He then performs the act of cleaning the Mahamuni's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence of cleaning with fresh towels. After this, sandalwood paste is applied to the image and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>again</b> cleaned with towels and finally sprinkled with scented water. After the ceremony is completed, the used towels are returned to the devotees who keep these towels with reverence in their home shrines.|$|E

25|$|The 1794 act {{authorised}} three further branches, to Aylesbury, Buckingham, and Wendover.

The Aylesbury arm was envisaged to become a through route to the Thames and thus to the Wilts and Berks Canal and the Kennet and Avon Canal, but the 6-mile (10-kilometre) branch into the town, opened in 1815, was never extended.|$|E

25|$|A {{block is}} {{performed}} when, after a shot is attempted, a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball. In almost all variants of play, {{it is illegal}} to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc; this is known as goaltending. It is also illegal under NBA and Men's NCAA basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard, or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim. Under international rules {{it is illegal to}} block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim. After the ball hits the rim, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>again</b> legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed.|$|E
500|$|Although Skopje {{has been}} {{destroyed}} many times through its history, it still has many historical landmarks which reflect the successive occupations of the city. Skopje {{has one of the}} biggest Ottoman urban complexes in Europe, with many Ottoman monuments still serving their original purpose. It was also a ground for modernist experiments in the 20th century, following the 1963 [...] earthquake. In the beginning of the 21st century, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>again</b> the subject of massive building campaigns, thanks to the [...] "Skopje 2014" [...] project. Skopje is thus an environment where old, new, progressist, reactionary, eastern and western perspectives coexist.|$|E
500|$|Star Wars is {{frequently}} referenced in 30 Rock, {{beginning with the}} pilot episode where Tracy Jordan is seen shouting {{that he is a}} Jedi. Liz Lemon admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and saying she dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four Halloweens. Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference [...] "started happening organically" [...] when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference [...] "in almost every show". Fey said that from then on [...] "it became a thing where [...] tried to keep it going", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a [...] "pretty high batting average". Fey attributed most of the references to Robert Carlock, who she described as [...] "the resident expert". In this episode, Star Wars is referenced twice: once when Liz tells Floyd that she and Pete are watching the movies on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list, but they only own Star Wars and Tootsie so they keep watching those two films. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>again</b> referenced during Tracy's dream, when Thomas Jefferson holds his hand up to Tracy and says [...] "May the Force be with you".|$|E

500|$|After {{securing}} {{the loyalty of}} the populace and the army, and completing the repairs to the walls, Belisarius resolved to meet Gelimer in battle, and in mid-December marched out of Carthage {{in the direction of}} the fortified Vandal camp at Tricamarum, some 28km from Carthage. As at Ad Decimum, the Roman cavalry proceeded in advance of the infantry, and the ensuing Battle of Tricamarum was a purely cavalry affair, with Belisarius' army considerably outnumbered. Both armies kept their most untrustworthy elements—the Moors and Huns—in reserve. John the Armenian played the most important role on the Roman side, and Tzazon on the Vandal. John led repeated charges at the Vandal centre, culminating in the death of Tzazon. This was followed by a general Roman attack across the front and the collapse of the Vandal army, which retreated to its camp. Gelimer, seeing that all was lost, fled with a few attendants into the wilds of Numidia, whereupon the remaining Vandals gave up all thoughts of resistance and abandoned their camp to be plundered by the Romans. Like the previous battle at Ad Decimum, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>again</b> notable that Belisarius failed to keep his forces together, and was forced to fight with a considerable numerical disadvantage. The dispersal of his army after the battle, looting heedlessly and leaving themselves vulnerable to a potential Vandal counter-attack was also an indication of the poor discipline in the Roman army and the command difficulties Belisarius faced. As Bury comments, the expedition's fate might have been quite different [...] "if Belisarius had been opposed to a commander of some ability and experience in warfare", and points out that Procopius himself [...] "expresses amazement at the issue of the war, and does not hesitate to regard it not as a feat of superior strategy but as a paradox of fortune".|$|E
500|$|Matsui {{had gotten}} his way, {{but he still}} {{understood}} that his troops were tired from the fighting in Shanghai. He therefore decided to advance slowly {{with the aim of}} securing the city within two months. Nevertheless, his subordinates refused to play along and instead raced with one another {{to be the first to}} Nanking. Matsui revised his plans only upon discovering that his own armies were well ahead of their scheduled operational targets. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>again</b> argued that Matsui was unable to restrain the men under his command, and that, since Matsui was an elderly general pulled from retirement, most of his younger and brasher subordinates had little respect for his orders and assumed that he would be back in the reserves and shortly out of their way. Matsui's command problems were made further complicated by the fact that, between December 5 and December 15, he was frequently bedridden due to bouts of malaria, which he had first shown symptoms of on November 4. Though ill, he forced himself to press on with his duties, issuing orders from his sickbed. On December 7 he moved his command post from Shanghai to Suzhou in order to be closer to the frontlines, and on December 9 he ordered that a [...] "summons to surrender" [...] be dropped by airplane over Nanking. Because the Chinese Army defending Nanking did not respond, the next day Matsui approved an all-out attack on the city. The CCAA suffered significant casualties fighting along the mountainous terrain just north of the city because Matsui had forbidden his men from using artillery there to prevent any damage from coming to its two famous historical sites, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum. Although the Chinese garrison defending Nanking collapsed under pressure of the Japanese attack within a few days, instead of formally surrendering the Chinese soldiers simply threw away their uniforms and weapons and then merged with the city's civilian population. The Japanese occupied Nanking on the night of December 12/13. Japanese soldiers in the city then massacred prisoners of war and engaged in random acts of murder, looting, and rape which are collectively known as the Nanking Massacre.|$|E
