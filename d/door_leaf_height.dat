40|$|Both {{defoliation}} {{and higher}} leaf placement can reduce growth in herbaceous plants. We examined variation in relative growth rate (RGR) and reproduction {{in response to}} defoliation and <b>leaf</b> <b>height</b> in Trillium grandiflorum at 4 sites in northern Wisconsin, USA. Plant biomass and the probability of flowering increased with increased <b>leaf</b> <b>height.</b> Analyses of covariance revealed that experimental defoliation and <b>leaf</b> <b>height</b> separately and independently reduced individual RGR, and accounted for about 42 % {{of the total variance}} in RGR. Defoliation in 1998 had no effect on flowering in 1999, but <b>leaf</b> <b>height</b> in 1998 was positively associated with the likelihood of flowering in 1999. RGR and plant responses to defoliation varied among sites. We conclude that defoliation and <b>leaf</b> <b>height</b> reduce RGR over short time scales...|$|R

40|$|Leaf {{area is a}} {{valuable}} index for evaluating growth and development of sweet herb Stevia [Stevia rebaudiana (Bert.) Bertoni]. A simple methodology was developed during 2006 to estimate the leaf area through Leaf Area Distribution Pattern (LADP) and regression equations. Plant <b>height,</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>height</b> {{as well as the}} length and breadth of all the measurable leaves were measured and their area was measured through Area meter (AM 300) for a six month old crop of Stevia. A leaf area coefficient of 0. 548 was found to fit for the linear equation without intercept. LADP was prepared with relative <b>leaf</b> <b>height</b> and relative <b>leaf</b> area. Based on the adjusted second order polynomial equation of LADP, the relative <b>leaf</b> <b>height</b> of plants representing the mean leaf area was ascertained and a regression equation was obtained to calculate the total leaf area of the plant. The results were validated with 3, 4 and 5 months old crops as well as with another accession.

Light level was manipulated {{through the use of}} shade cloth to attain shading levels of 0 %, 30 %, 63 % and 90 %, while herbivory was simulated by reducing plant height by 50 % six weeks into the experiment. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) of final total (shoot + root) plant mass, leaf width and root to shoot ratio (R:S) indicated overall significant effects of both light and the interaction of light and clipping. Means of these variables decreased with decreasing light level. Furthermore, means of these variables were generally higher for clipped plants than unclipped plants in 0 % shade, while they tended to be lower in clipped plants in all other levels of shade. Maximum <b>leaf</b> <b>height</b> was also significantly affected by light. <b>Leaf</b> <b>height</b> was similar in all treatments for the first 11 weeks. For the last four weeks of the experiment, however, <b>leaf</b> <b>height</b> was lowest in plants grown in 0 % shade, highest in plants grown in 63 and 90 % shade, and intermediate in plants grown in 30 % shade. Clipped plants tended to be taller than unclipped plants at lower levels of shade, while the opposite was true at higher levels of shade, although effects were marginally significant. Both light and the interactive effect of light and clipping were important determinants of growth of S. ancistrochaetus in this experiment and therefore may be important influences on its distribution within and among pond habitats...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Floodplain lakes are {{especially}} dynamic {{due to the}} irregular flow regime of the Paraná River and its location along the geomorphologic gradient between the lakes and the river. The response of Eichhornia cras-sipes (Mart.) Solms (one of the most frequent aquatic plant) was studied in two floodplain lakes with different flooding regimes. Samples were taken between March 1997 and December 2001 on 13 different hydrologic conditions during prolonged hydrologic connection and prolonged hydrologic isolation. <b>Leaf</b> <b>height,</b> <b>leaf</b> den-sity, biomass and nutrient content of the mature leaves of E. crassipes were measured and related to water level fluctuation and the hydrologic connectivity. The lake more connected with the main channel had a long lasting inundation phase. In this condition the surface area covered by water increased {{more than three times}} compared to prolonged hydrologic isolation condition. As river water entered the floodplain lakes, dissolved inorganic nitrogen increased to high values, especially NO 3 -, whereas the isolation condition was characterised by a decrease in NO 3 - concentrations to undetectable levels. Compared to plants growing in the more isolated lake, those growing in the more connected lake had a significantly lower leaf density, longer leaves, less root biomass and lower ratio between below-ground and above-ground biomasses. However, total and leaf biomasses were not significantly different between sites.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{describe}} the relationship between grazing time and herbage intake and identify tools to grazing management of dairy cows grazing Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) on a rotational grazing method. Six dairy cows in mid-lactation period were allowed to graze paddocks during three grazing cycles. During each cycle cows grazed two paddocks with 9 days of occupation by paddock and an herbage allowance of 30 kg DM cow- 1 day- 1. Measurements were made in the last 9 days of each period and during intervals between cycles cows grazed an adjacent area with a mixed of temperate species. It was compared three grazing cycles and cows eating similar herbage amount with different daily grazing time. Independently of herbage intake, daily grazing time increased 12 min by cm of the reduction on <b>leaf</b> <b>height.</b> Reductions on efficiency to graze are clearly associated to structural traits of canopy as proximity to ground level and stems + pseudo-stems content on the graze layer.

40|$|Animal {{productivity}} may {{be enhanced}} through greater intake {{associated with the}} use of preferred pasture species provided they are of high nutritional value. Grazing preference by ewe hoggets was investigated in three grazing trials and an indoor feeding trial. The first grazing trial (April 3 - 12, 1990) examined the preference of ewe hoggets for three grass treatments, each containing white clover. The grass treatments were endophyte (Acremonium lolii) infected (+E) perennial ryegrass, endophyte free (-E) perennial ryegrass and tall fescue. Two 0. 2 ha blocks, each containing three replicates of the three grass treatments were sown in spring 1989. Endophyte incidence (% infected tillers) was 40 % in +E ryegrass and 0 % in -E ryegrass. Tillers were vegetative. Ewe hoggets (15) were introduced into the plots and their preferences recorded by visual observations from a raised viewing tower, and agronomic measurements on the plots. On day 1 of grazing a high proportion (76 %) of ewe hoggets grazed tall fescue while a low proportion (12 %) grazed both +E and –E ryegrass. From day 2 to 10 of grazing a similar number of sheep grazed each grass treatment. Grass <b>leaf</b> <b>height</b> declined less in +E ryegrass (48 %), than -E ryegrass (64 %) and tall fescue (71 %) during grazing. Pseudostem height of grasses was reduced 4. 2 mm in tall fescue and -E ryegrass but only 1. 5 mm in +E ryegrass by grazing. Pasture mass declined more in -E ryegrass (1230 kg DM/ha) than +E ryegrass (1100 kg DM/ha) or tall fescue (1020 kg DM/ha). The percentage green grass cover (point analysis first hits) decreased with grazing in all grass treatments but less in +E ryegrass (21 %) than -E ryegrass (34 %) and tall fescue (28 %). White clover percentage was low in all grass treatments (4 - 7 %) prior to grazing and declined with grazing. Both +E and –E ryegrass contained more dead material than tall fescue. In a second grazing trial (May 14 - 21) the same plots were either mown to 30 mm or left unmown two weeks prior to grazing and also subdivided into urine and non-urine patches. No endophyte was detected in either +E or -E ryegrass. Ewe hoggets (20) were introduced and agronomic measurements made during grazing. The height of grass leaves in all treatments was always greater in urine than non-urine patches but grass <b>leaf</b> <b>height</b> declined more rapidly in urine patches. The grass <b>leaf</b> <b>height</b> of +E and –E ryegrass was twice that of tall fescue in urine and non-urine patches throughout grazing. Pasture mass, prior to grazing, over all treatments was higher (1990 vs 1578 kg DM/ha) but declined more during grazing (928 v 751 kg DM/ha) in urine than non-urine patches. Mowing created a constant pseudostem height (30 - 32 mm) but did not influence pasture mass or grass <b>leaf</b> <b>height</b> changes. In the third grazing trial (25 September - 5 October) measurements of grass <b>leaf</b> <b>height</b> were made throughout grazing on +E (60 % infection) ryegrass and -E ryegrass (0 % infection) plots that were part of a grazing preference study consisting of four replicates of eight grasses or herbs. Plots had been ungrazed since May 23, 1990. Reproductive tiller development had begun. The height of +E and -E ryegrass were similar prior to grazing (180 mm) but declined more in -E ryegrass (135 mm) than +E ryegrass (80 mm). Endophyte incidence in laxly grazed areas of +E ryegrass plots was 70 % but only 30 % in intensively grazed areas. The rate of eating of different feeds (white clover, tall fescue, +E ryegrass (70 % infection) and -E ryegrass (0 % infection)) was measured by offering 100 g fresh samples of each alone to eight hungry sheep and recording time taken to consume each sample. Eating rates were highest for white clover (5. 52 g DM/minl and lowest for +E ryegrass (2. 89 g DM/min) with tall fescue (3. 86 g DM/min) and -E ryegrass (3. 94 g DM/min) intermediate. The three grass feeds were then separated into pseudostem and leaf, and the rate of eating measured. Leaf material was eaten at similar rate for all grasses (3. 86 - 4. 21 g DM/min). The +E ryegrass pseudostems were eaten more slowly (1. 85 g DM/min) than -E ryegrass (2. 65 g DM/min) or tall fescue (3. 47 g DM/min). The slower rate of decline of grass <b>leaf</b> <b>height,</b> the smaller amount of pseudostem, pasture mass and green leaf removed, and the lower rate of eating of endophyte infected +E ryegrass when compared to -E ryegrass is interpreted as discrimination by sheep against endophyte infected +E ryegrass. It is proposed that low animal production of sheep grazing +E ryegrass can be attributed to the reduced intake of +E ryegrass because of avoidance behaviour. It is also suggested that the avoidance of sheep by fungus from eating the grass, is an adaptive mechanism of the fungus to ensure continued survival via seed spread...|$|R
