On the basis of close analysis of synchronic and diachronic data, {{it is argued that}} the peculiarities of Present-day emphasizer pure are the result of two distinct but mutually reinforcing paths of development. Emphasizing pure first appeared as a subjective <b>heightener</b> of emotion nouns in the syntactic environment pure + noun, in which it subsequently spread to other collocational sets.

All sounds are her servants, and purveyors, proclaiming not only that their mistress is, but is a rare mistress, and earnestly to be sought after. They are so far akin to Silence, that they are but bubbles on her surface, which straightway burst, an evidence of the strength and prolificness of the under-current; a faint utterance of Silence, and then only agreeable to our auditory nerves when they contrast themselves with and relieve the former. In proportion as they do this, and are <b>heighteners</b> and intensifiers of the Silence, they are harmony and purest melody.|$|R
