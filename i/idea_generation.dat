25|$|An {{important}} innovation factor includes customers buying {{products or}} using services. As a result, firms may incorporate users in focus groups (user centred approach), {{work closely with}} so called lead users (lead user approach) or users might adapt their products themselves. The lead user method focuses on <b>idea</b> <b>generation</b> based on leading users to develop breakthrough innovations. U-STIR, a project to innovate Europe’s surface transportation system, employs such workshops. Regarding this user innovation, {{a great deal of}} innovation is done by those actually implementing and using technologies and products as part of their normal activities. Sometimes user-innovators may become entrepreneurs, selling their product, they may choose to trade their innovation in exchange for other innovations, or they may be adopted by their suppliers. Nowadays, they may also choose to freely reveal their innovations, using methods like open source. In such networks of innovation the users or communities of users can further develop technologies and reinvent their social meaning.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Alice Flaherty {{presented}} a three-factor {{model of the}} creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the temporal lobes, and dopamine from the limbic system. The frontal lobes {{can be seen as}} responsible for <b>idea</b> <b>generation,</b> and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe (such as depression or anxiety) generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vice versa. High dopamine levels increase general arousal and goal directed behaviors and reduce latent inhibition, and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas. [...] A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other default mode network functions.|$|E

40|$|Over the years, {{there have}} been several {{definitions}} of an entrepreneur but the 21 st century definition by Schumpeter is that of innovation which he saw as an engine of economic development. Architectural training in institutions of higher learning entails training of individuals to reason creatively through series of line drawings and <b>ideas</b> <b>generation.</b> This equips prospective students towards blending into the world of construction and contracts administration and without the basic knowledge or skills of engagement, it’s next to impossible surviving the competition. Further equipping the student with entrepreneurial skills makes him more versatile and thus become a Li-Id preneur (Lines-Ideas preneur) due to his training through lines drawings and <b>ideas</b> <b>generation.</b> This paper investigated the characteristics of the Li-Id preneurs of students in Covenant University, Nigeria. This was done by administering a well-structured questionnaire and interviews for proper conclusion on the subject matter from a cross section of students from final year in Architecture and Business Studies in 2016 - 2017 academic sessions. The data collected was statistically analysed with SPSS software and it showed that it was imperative that entrepreneurial skills acquisition was key and fundamental towards business intelligence and making the student better equipped in all round skills acquisition. It also showed that while the Li-Id preneur had acquired skills in line drawings and <b>ideas</b> <b>generation,</b> having an alternative means of livelihood was a giant leap towards economic empowerment and national development. Also, the teaching of entrepreneurial skills {{should be part of the}} education curriculum during these formative years of the Li-Id preneur’s lif...|$|R

London’s {{cultural}} diversity is widely seen as a social asset, but there is little hard evidence on its importance for the city’s businesses.

The results, which are robust to most endogeneity challenges, suggest there is a small but significant ‘diversity bonus’ for London firms.
