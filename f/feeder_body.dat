40|$|Electronic swine feeders {{are used}} to {{automatically}} measure individual feed intake on group-housed pigs and are often used in breeding herds. Data from these feeders contain errors. In addition, electronic feeders could affect performance of growing pigs and are expensive. To address these concerns, the objectives of this research were to develop and evaluate editing methods, to measure the effect of electronic feeders on performance, and to develop and evaluate strategies that maximize the number of pigs measured per feeder. The percentage of visits that contained errors, based on 16 criteria, ranged from 4. 3 to 18. 7 % in three data sets {{and seemed to be}} largely affected by management of the feeder. A model was developed to adjust daily feed intake from error-free visits for the combined effect of errors. This and five other editing methods were then used to edit data from 124 pigs with simulated errors. The correlation of edited with true observations ranged from 0. 82 to 0. 96 for feed intake on a given day and from 0. 93 to 0. 99 for average daily feed intake. To evaluate the effect of electronic feeders on performance, 475 boars and gilts were fed using an electronic feeder or a conventional <b>feeder.</b> <b>Body</b> weight, backfat thickness, loin muscle area, and pen daily feed intake per pig were measured serially. Gilts on electronic feeders ate less, grew slower, and deposited less backfat and loin muscle area throughout the test period. There were no differences for boars. To maximize the number of pigs that are tested per electronic feeder, strategies of alternating the use of a feeder between pens of pigs were simulated in a complete data set that contained 12 weeks of feed intake data. When two pens were tested per feeder, the correlation between estimated and true average daily feed intake was 0. 98 and 0. 94 in ideal and poor data conditions, respectively. These results indicate that testing twice as many boars and using the appropriate editing method will increase the number of pigs tested and improve the accuracy of feed intake, which will in turn increase the rate of genetic progress in swine improvement programs...|$|E

Here we interpret high-resolution aeromagnetic data and models for James Ross archipelago and surrounding regions {{to provide a}} new perspective on Neogene magmatism emplaced along the eastern margin of the Antarctic Peninsula. Based on the analysis and modelling of magnetic anomalies we were able to image the subglacial extent of Miocene to Recent alkaline rocks of the James Ross Island Volcanic Group and map tectonic structures that appear to have exerted important controls on Neogene magmatism. High-amplitude linear anomalies detected over Mount Haddington stratovolcano were modelled as caused by subvertical <b>feeder</b> <b>bodies</b> extending to a depth of at least 3 km. These <b>feeder</b> <b>bodies</b> may have been emplaced along a N–S oriented volcano-tectonic rift zone. We also identified several effusive subglacial centres and imaged two concentric magnetic arcs, which we related to Neogene volcanic and subvolcanic lineaments, likely controlled by Mid-Cretaceous strike-slip fault belts and associated deformation zones. The regional magnetic quiet zone that encompasses James Ross Island is caused by the thick sedimentary infill of the Larsen Basin, and a low-amplitude magnetic high within the basin is inferred to reflect a basement push-up structure associated with strike-slip faulting along {{the eastern edge of the}} Antarctic Peninsula. In the offshore regions magnetic anomalies southwest of Tabarin Peninsula and west of Vega Island may reflect recent volcanic structures that have yet to emerge from the sea-floor...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{backscatter}} from multi-beam echo-sounder (MBES) and dual-frequency single-beam echo-sounding systems (SBES) operable at 95 kHz and 33 / 210 kHz, respectively, {{were used}} to study the distribution of sediment texture and benthic macro-fauna along {{the central part of}} the western continental shelf of India (off Goa). To characterize the continental shelf seafloor, single-beam and multi-beam backscatter signals were acquired along with grab sediment samples. The relationships between processed acoustic backscatter strength, grain size, and benthic macro-fauna abundance were demonstrated employing clustering technique (PCA) and Geographic Information System (GIS) based mapping. The clustering analysis delineated that the backscatter values at three frequencies are strongly correlated with both substrate type and faunal functional groups. The preferences of deposit <b>feeders</b> (soft <b>body</b> benthic macro-fauna) for the fine-sediment regions and filter <b>feeders</b> (hard <b>body</b> benthic macro-fauna) for coarse sediment regions were linked to the variations in sediment granulometry as well as backscatter strengths in the study area.

40|$|Precambrian {{rocks in}} northwestern Chamwood Forest differ {{markedly}} from their lateral equivalents {{to the east}} and south. They are subdivided into the Whitwick Volcanic Complex, of massive to intensely brecciated high-silica andesites and porphyritic dacites, and the Chamwood Lodge Volcanic Formation, which is a thickly bedded sequence of mainly andesitic to dacitic volcanic breccias and lapillituffs. Lithological elements common to both of these units are indicated by field, petrographical and geochemical evidence, which suggests the existence of two 'genetic associations' of rock-types. These associations, and various other units that are distinctive to this region, form the basis of a model that views the Whitwick Complex as an aggregation of magmatic <b>feeder</b> <b>bodies</b> that supplied material, in the form of blocks and lapilli, to a volcaniclastic apron represented by the Chamwood Lodge Formation. The analogues for these rocks can be drawn from the axial magmatic zones of modem or geologically very young volcanic arc systems. The high-silica (dacitic and rhyolitic) Charnian magmas were intruded into unconsolidated wet sediments, resulting in physical interactions that generated peperitic lithologies and related breccias. By contrast, the andesitic magmas may have extruded subaerially as lava domes that periodically collapsed, giving rise to block and ash pyroclastic flows and lahars...|$|R

40|$|Two {{divergent}} lines wereselected in the Large White breed for residual {{feed intake}} (RFI), {{defined as the}} difference between observed feed intake and feed intake predicted from maintenance and growth requirements, to evaluate its potential for improving feed efficiency in growing pigs. During selection, pigs were offered a non‐limiting diet. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the impact of a limiting lysine supply on growth and body composition performances in the seventh generation of the two lines. In each line, 70 barrows, housed in pens of 11 to 12 pigs, were tested between 25. 5 ± 3. 6 kg and 94. 6 ± 15. 8 kg in three successive batches (one pen per line x diet combination per batch). One of two diets was offered ad libitum to the pigs: a deficient diet regularly adjusted to meet the lysine requirement of only 25 % of the RFI+ (high RFI) pigs, and a control diet formulated to meet the requirement for all pigs in the two lines. Requirement estimates were obtained from InraPorc®. Daily feed intake was recorded individually using automatic <b>feeders.</b> <b>Body</b> weight and backfat thickness were measured at beginning and end of the experiment. The lysine deficiency resulted in a decrease in ADG which was significantly greater in RFI‐ (low RFI) pigs (‐ 32 %) than in RFI+ pigs (‐ 11 %), confirming InraPorc® estimations: the lysine requirement of RFI‐ pigs, expressed in g/kg of diet, is then higher than that of RFI+ pigs. Therefore, the higher RFI of RFI+ pigs is not necessarily driven by an increased lysine requirement...|$|R

The same model was run again replacing the direct simple body measurements (BW and P 2) with the estimated values of PFI as source of variation. Results. The Gompertz estimates of mature protein mass (Pm), relative growth rate parameter (B) and lipid to protein ratio at maturity were 43. 5 ± 5. 8 kg, 0. 0116 ± 0. 0011 d- 1 and 1. 81 ± 0. 30, respectively. The current protein mass averaged 18. 5 + 1. 6 kg and the daily retentions of protein and lipid were 177 ± 21 and 239 ± 62 g/d, respectively. FI and PFI averaged 2. 824 ± 0. 448 and 2. 814 ± 0. 393 kg/d, respectively. In the ANOVA of the FI data, the replacement of direct body measurements by PFI did not change the proportion of variance explained (83 %) and the RSD (0. 199 g/d). The two sets of residual feed intake values obtained from the two ANOVA were highly correlated (RSD = 0. 043 kg/d; R 2 = 0. 961). Agreement between predicted and determined feed intakes provided a reasonable guarantee to the estimated (based on BW and P 2) changes of body composition. Thus, a scheduled protocol of measurement of BW and P 2 over the course of growth, coupled with the use of allometry, can be proposed to estimate in vivo the change of the chemical status of pigs kept under non limiting conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} long-standing question regarding Mars {{history is}} whether the flat and low-lying northern plains ever hosted an ocean. The best opportunity {{to solve this problem}} is provided by stratigraphic observations of sedimentary deposits onlapping the crustal dichotomy. Here, we use high-resolution imagery and topography to analyze a branching network of inverted channel and channel lobe deposits in the Aeolis Dorsa region, just north of the dichotomy boundary. Observations of stacked, cross-cutting channel bodies and stratal geometries indicate that these landforms represent exhumed distributary channel deposits. Observations of depositional trunk <b>feeder</b> channel <b>bodies,</b> a lack of evidence for past topographic confinement, channel avulsions at similar elevations, and the presence of a strong break in dip slope between topset and foreset beds suggest that this distributary system was most likely a delta, rather than an alluvial fan or submarine fan. Sediment transport calculations using both measured and derived channel geometries indicate a minimum delta deposition time on the order of 400 [*]years. The location of this delta within a thick and widespread clastic wedge abutting the crustal dichotomy boundary, unconfined by any observable craters, suggests a standing body of water potentially 105 [*]km 2 in extent or greater and is spatially consistent with hypotheses for a northern ocean...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of environment, nutrition and management on egg production of broiler breeders from start to peak of production. Rearing and production records of 11 Arian broiler breeder flocks, in 3 farms between 1993 and 2000, including age of broiler breeder, age of maturity, flock number, farm number, density, <b>feeder</b> space/hen, <b>body</b> weight at 20, 22 and 24 weeks, protein and energy intake/day and week, cumulative feed intake in each age, weekly body weight, season effect, diet energy and presence or lack of canal under waterers were used. All records processed in excel software and transferred to JMP 3. 1. 2 software for analysis. Records tested for normality and then analyzed with multiple regression analysis procedure. The results of the current study indicated that, age of broiler breeders has a dramatic effect on egg production. By delaying age of maturity after 24 weeks, uniformity and egg production in Arian broiler breeders increased. Canals under waterer in some of the farms had a negative effect on mean egg production (63 vs 52 %). In the seasons of spring and autumn, mean egg production was higher than those of summer and winter (80. 03, 81. 08, 50. 16 and 60 %, respectively). The result showed that body weight at 24 weeks is a better indication of subsequent flock performance than body weight at 20 or 22 weeks. By increasing age and protein intake from 23 to 27 g/hen/day, egg production decreased. Conversely, by increasing age and energy intake, egg production increased. Under the conditions of this study, it was concluded that protein intake should not be increased from 23 g/hen/day at this period. Heavier broiler breeders, who get more energy intake/day, may produce more eggs too...|$|R
40|$|Many animals display {{seasonal}} {{patterns of}} behaviour and metabolism {{that can be}} also be observed in captivity. During an obesity-control program in Andean bears (Tremarctos ornatus) at Zoo Zurich, a seasonal fluctuation of body mass war observed once ideal body mass had been reached. The focus {{of this study was}} the question if metabolism of a male and three female animals was affected by seasonality according to their seasonal breeding behaviour, using data on pelleted food intake (from computer controlled <b>feeders)</b> and <b>body</b> mass (from regular weighing). The pelleted diet in the feeder boxes was provided additionally to a daily ration containing vegetables, fruits, pellets for environmental enrichment, and fish. This daily ration was adjusted, within prescribed limits, by the animal keepers depending on the previous day's consumption. Formulas developed for dogs were used to estimate the metabolizable energy (ME) content of the diet and maintenance requirement of the bears depending on their individual body mass. Energy requirements for minimum walked distances between the feeders was calculated as well as energy requirement for fat accretion or energy gained from body fat by body mass loss. Body mass showed a seasonal fluctuation with maxima in spring and minima in autumn, in contrast to the pattern typically observed in animals from the temperate zone; in the male, the body mass maximum occurred later than in the females. Feed intake from feeder boxes peaked in autumn, at the beginning of body mass gain in the females. These patterns cannot be explained as seasonal adaptations to climatic changes in the zoo environment, but match the natural breeding season of Andean bears in their natural habitat, suggesting genetically fixed photoperiodic clues. The data indicate that body mass fluctuation in a range considered ideal for the species was mostly based on the additional food whose amount was adjusted - within limits - by the keepers on a daily basis. Such adjustment, without incurring the risk of obesity in bears that are known as voracious eaters, {{is a good example of}} the skill required in animal husbandry...|$|R
40|$|Insect {{body color}} polyphenisms enhance {{survival}} by producing crypsis in diverse backgrounds. While color polyphenisms are often indirectly induced by temperature, rearing density, or diet, insects {{can benefit from}} immediate crypsis if they evolve polyphenisms directly induced by exposure to the background color, hence immediately deriving protection from predation. Here, we examine such a directly induced color polyphenism in caterpillars of the geometrid peppered moth (Biston betularia). This larval color polyphenism is unrelated to the genetic polymorphism for melanic phenotypes in adult moths. B. betularia caterpillars are generalist <b>feeders</b> and develop <b>body</b> colors that closely match the brown or green twigs of their host plant. We expand on previous studies examining the proximal cues that stimulate color development. Under controlled rearing conditions, we manipulated diets and background reflectance, using both natural and artificial twigs, and show that visual experience has a much stronger effect than does diet in promoting precise color matching. Their induced body color was not a simple response to reflectance or light intensity but instead specifically matched the wavelength of light {{to which they were}} exposed. We also show that the potential to change color is retained until the final (sixth) larval instar. Given their broad host range, this directly induced color polyphenism likely provides the caterpillars with strong protection from bird predation...|$|R
40|$|The use of micro-scale {{metallic}} pins {{in small}} engineering devices poses numerous problems {{due to their}} physical size and the dominant forces which act on micro-scale objects. Assembly of devices with micro-scale parts is problematic because the components are below the practical threshold of unaided human manipulation and most robotic manipulation. The use of tweezers and microscopes to aid human assembly is possible but challenging because the micro-scale pins tend to adhere to tweezers. Previous work has found that vibratory feeder-bowls provide a feasible means to singulate and orient micro-scale pins by overcoming the adhesive forces that plague other manipulation techniques. ^ The analysis and prediction {{of the behavior of}} vibratory feeder bowls for micro-scale components has previously been limited to two dimensions. To advance the understanding of vibratory feeder bowls for micro-pins, a three dimensional simulation has been developed that predicts the pin capture rates {{as a function of the}} physical properties of the <b>feeder</b> bowl and <b>bodies.</b> This model is based on an impulse-momentum contact model and it incorporates traditional macro-scale forces such as gravity, air-drag, and friction as well as micro-scale interactions such as magnetic and electrostatic forces.

Finally, the simulation was used to conduct a parametric study to characterize the effects that varying system parameters have on the performance of the feeder bowl. ...|$|R
40|$|SELFDOTT project 2009 Periodic ReportIn reproduction, {{one of the}} two captive broodstocks [...] {{maintained}} in Spain [...] was successfully induced to mature and spawn using the developed controlled-release delivery systems (implants) loaded with GnRHa. The broodstock began spawning on the 29 th June 2009, three days after hormonal treatment, and spawned daily for a period of 17 days with a total of 140 million eggs. Daily fecundity ranged between 285, 000 eggs to 34, 000, 000. Fertilization success was almost 100 %, as probably only fertilized eggs floated to the surface and were collected. No spawning was observed and no eggs were collected from the other broodstock {{maintained in}} Malta and this was perhaps due to too late hormonal treatment and/or the hydrodynamics of the site. Other major results achieved include the study of the age of puberty in captive reared BFT, the development of an efficient broodstock diet for captive BFT, the successful deployment of a broodstock cage light and temperature remote sensing system to monitor and predict induction opportunities and muscle biopsies obtained from a new broodstock in Malta and from individuals spawning in the Levantine Sea for DNA analysis of the population genetics study. Larval rearing husbandry tasks were satisfactorily supplied with Bonito (Sarda sarda) and viable BFT eggs. Several experiments have been implemented using the 3 targeted larval rearing methods: Mesocosm, pseudo green water and clear water. In the best case bonito rearing attempts have been conducted to 80 dph in mesocosm and a small batch initially produced in pseudo green water is still alive (300 dph). In mesocosm swimbladder inflation rates scored between 60 and 78 % while they reached 60 % in pseudo green water and 85 % in clear water. In BFT, the rearing time lasted 60 dph in mesocosm, 73 dph in pseudo green water and 20 dph in clear water. In mesocosm swimbladder inflation rates was 50 %, scored 58 % in pseudo green water but ranged between 1. 2 and 5 % in clear water. Light intensity, lighting regime, hydrodynamics, surface cleaning, microalgae addition, feed sequence and nutritional quality have been identified as the main factors to be fine tuned mainly during the larval rearing stage. In order to obtain molecular tools for the spatial and temporal localization of the corresponding transcripts, genes of interest were partially cloned. The early development of BFT posterior lateral line has been examined. Ontogeny of digestive tract in Bonito and BFT was rather extensively described. Regarding the immune system ontogeny, a preliminary approach has been conducted. Other studies including the evaluation of the microbiotal diversity of the digestive tract and the bacterial characterization in larvae have been carried out. For Nutrition and feeding studies, Young Bluefin Tuna (YBFT) were used to start the artificial feeding trials. First weaning trials with artificial food was successfully achieved. A trial to compare two diets: raw fish and artificial food has been started. The stomach analyses of captured dead YBFT showed that fish are the main prey (37 % in weight), followed by cephalopods (11 %) and crustaceans (5 %). The main prey species is the round sardinella (Sardinella sp). These results contrast with the ones obtained last year where cephalopods were the main prey, so YBFT can be considered a generalist <b>feeder.</b> From the <b>body</b> composition analyses it seems that YBFTs have different nutritional requirement from most other Mediterranean aquaculture species: high protein and low fat content with significantly higher values of EPA+DHA for YBFTs and higher amino acid concentrations. In the dissemination of the results, nine Conference presentations have been held and close to 100 press releases have been published mainly in Spain and France.
