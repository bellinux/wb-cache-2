25|$|The first twenty-two {{cycles of}} the series were {{presented}} by Banks, with cycle 23 being presented by Rita Ora. The series employs a panel {{of three or four}} judges. The original panel consisted of Banks, Janice Dickinson, Beau Quillian and Kimora Lee Simmons. Quillian and Simmons were replaced by Nigel Barker and Eric Nicholson <b>in</b> <b>cycle</b> 2, before Nicholson was replaced by Nolé Marin <b>in</b> <b>cycle</b> 3. After cycle 4, Marin and Dickinson were replaced by J. Alexander and Twiggy <b>in</b> <b>cycle</b> 5. Paulina Porizkova joined the panel <b>in</b> <b>cycle</b> 10, in place of Twiggy. After cycle 12, Porizkova was fired by Banks and the panel was left with three judges (Banks, Alexander and Barker) <b>in</b> <b>cycle</b> 13. <b>In</b> <b>cycle</b> 14, Alexander left the panel and was replaced by André Leon Talley, but continued as the series' runway coach. <b>In</b> <b>cycle</b> 18, Kelly Cutrone replaced Talley. After cycle 18, Banks fired long-standing cast members Barker, Alexander and photo shoot director Jay Manuel. Barker was replaced by Rob Evans <b>in</b> <b>cycle</b> 19, and Manuel by Johnny Wujek. Alexander returned to the panel <b>in</b> <b>cycle</b> 21 in place of Evans, before the entire panel was replaced with Ora, Ashley Graham, Drew Elliott and Law Roach <b>in</b> <b>cycle</b> 23. Ora will be replaced as presenter and judge by the returning Banks for the upcoming cycle 24.|$|E

25|$|Cycles 1–16 and cycle 19 each {{consisted}} of a cast of between 10 and 14 (13 or 14 from cycle 3 onwards) female contestants with no previous participation on the series. Cycle 17's cast consisted entirely of previous participants, while cycle 18's had seven new contestants and seven former Britain's Next Top Model participants, {{one of whom was}} the eventual winner, Sophie Sumner. Cycles 20–22 featured male contestants in the contest, including two eventual winners (Keith Carlos <b>in</b> <b>cycle</b> 21 and Nyle DiMarco <b>in</b> <b>cycle</b> 22). Cycle 23 follows the series' original format of an all-new, all-female cast. , 23 people have won the competition: Adrianne Curry, Yoanna House, Eva Pigford, Naima Mora, Nicole Linkletter, Danielle Evans, CariDee English, Jaslene Gonzalez, Saleisha Stowers, Whitney Thompson, McKey Sullivan, Teyona Anderson, Nicole Fox, Krista White, Ann Ward, Brittani Kline, Lisa D'Amato, Sophie Sumner, Laura James, Jourdan Miller, Keith Carlos, Nyle DiMarco and India Gants.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the blood flow parameters between cycles {{of the same}} women to assess whether parameters predicting a successful pregnancy <b>in</b> a stimulation <b>cycle</b> {{could be used to}} determine the outcome of subsequent natural cycles. Design: A prospective study. Setting: Assisted reproduction unit, the University of Hong Kong. Patient(s) : Fifty-eight IVF cycles and 40 natural cycles were evaluated. Intervention(s) : Assessments of the utero-ovarian pulsatility indices (PIs), resistance indices (RIs), and endometrial color signals. Result(s) : <b>In</b> IVF <b>cycles,</b> the pregnancy rate (27 %) was similar to that in frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) (28 %) cycles. The utero-ovarian PIs and RIs <b>in</b> IVF <b>cycles</b> were significantly lower than those <b>in</b> the natural <b>cycles.</b> There was a significant correlation between the uterine PI <b>in</b> stimulation <b>cycles</b> and that <b>in</b> natural <b>cycles.</b> <b>In</b> IVF <b>cycles,</b> the pregnancy rate declined significantly when the uterine PI was > 2. 70 and the RI was > 0. 9. <b>In</b> FET <b>cycles,</b> no decline <b>in</b> pregnancy rate was seen. Conceptional FET cycles showed significantly higher uterine PI, uterine RI, and endometrial color signals compared with conceptional IVF cycles. Conclusion(s) : Hemodynamic parameters <b>in</b> stimulation <b>cycles</b> are different from those <b>in</b> natural <b>cycles,</b> and the values of various parameters in predicting pregnancy are also different. © 2002 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|Multiplying {{permutations}} written <b>in</b> <b>cycle</b> notation follows no easily described pattern, and {{the cycles}} of the product can be entirely {{different from those of}} the permutations being composed. However the cycle structure is preserved in the special case of conjugating a permutation σ by another permutation π, which means forming the product π·σ·π−1. Here the cycle notation of the result can be obtained by taking the cycle notation for σ and applying π to all the entries in it.|$|E
