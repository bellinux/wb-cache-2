25|$|Research using {{mathematical}} modelling is indeed demonstrating that predation can indeed stabilize lumps of very similar species. Willow warbler and chiffchaff and other very similar warblers {{can serve as}} an example. The idea {{is that it is}} also a good strategy to be very similar to a successful species or have enough dissimilarity. Also trees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> can serve as an example of all high canopy species basically following the same strategy. Other examples of nearly identical species clusters occupying the same niche were water beetles, prairie birds and algae.The basic idea is that there can be clusters of very similar species all applying the same successful strategy and between them open spaces. Here the species cluster takes the place of a single species in the classical ecological models.|$|E
