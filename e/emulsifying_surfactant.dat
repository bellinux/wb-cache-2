40|$|Biodiesel {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} alternative clean fuels to fossil fuel, which can effectively reduce the emissions from fossil fuel burning. The high oxygen content in biodiesel can promote the burning process, but it can also increase NOx formation simultaneously, when biodiesel is used as fuel. Fuel emulsification is considered to be effective in reducing NOx emissions. In this study, soybean oil was used as raw oil to produce biodiesel by transesterification reaction. The biodiesel product was then emulsified with water and <b>emulsifying</b> <b>surfactant</b> to form water-in-oil (w/o) biodiesel emulsion. The biodiesel emulsion composed of 1. 5 % polyoxyethylated castor oil (EL- 12), 0. 7 % lethicin and 0. 5 % cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) was proved to have the better emulsifying activity (EA) and emulsifying stability (ES) values, and higher combustion heat than those of the neat biodiesel and reference biodiesel emulsion (with 2. 7 % EL- 12 as the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>surfactant)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|A {{novel and}} highly {{efficient}} oil-water separator {{equipped with a}} series of inclined multiple arc coalescence plates is developed and optimized for the removal of stable oil emulsions from produced water. The synthetic high salinity produced water with stable emulsions was prepared by mixing Catenex oil and the <b>emulsifying</b> <b>surfactant</b> (Armac T) with brine water. A series of experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of the arc coalescence plate geometry, produced water volumetric flow rate, influent oil concentration, and treatment temperature on the oil removal efficiency using the developed separator. Optimal coalescence plate arc geometry for maximum oil removal at different operating conditions was determined. Using the optimal coalescence plate arc geometry., strong correlations between oil removal efficiency from produced water, volumetric flow rate, and treatment temperature were established. The results demonstrated that the developed oil-water separator is highly effective in the treatment of stable emulsions in produced waters due to the combined effects of chemical demulsification and oil droplet coalescence.

40|$|Background: Accumulation of {{petroleum}} hydrocarbons {{in the environment}} is often attributed to inherently slow degradation rates. This {{study was conducted to}} determine if diesel biodegradation by cultures exhibiting inducible cell surface hydrophobicity could be enhanced by addition of a chemical surfactant promoting emulsification. Experiments were designed to determine quantitatively the enhancement in diesel degradation caused by Triton X- 100 for two bacterial cultures, Exiguobacterium aurantiacum and Burkholderia cepacia. Results: In the presence of Triton X- 100 at twice the critical micelle concentration (CMC) the extent of degradation in whole diesel in 5 days was 1. 6 - 1. 8 times that observed over 15 days with no surfactant. The enhancement in overall degradation of diesel range resolved peaks (DRRP, representing n-alkanes and branched alkanes) was 1. 76 and 1. 26 times for E. aurantiacum and B. cepacia cultures respectively. Although an enhancement in decay rate was observed for all n-alkane components, it was most significant for C 19, C 25 and pristane. Conclusion: For cultures exhibiting direct interfacial uptake, the beneficial effect of an <b>emulsifying</b> <b>surfactant</b> found here is in contrast to earlier studies reporting a detrimental effect due to detachment of cells from the oil/water interface. Surfactant addition may have significant potential in enhancing degradation of the more recalcitrant components. (C) 2007 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E

Arsenic contamination is enhanced through carbon addition, such as biostimulation, a remediation process, which has been used to remove trichloroethylene (TCE) from sediment and groundwater. Two studies were designed to evaluate the effect of different carbon sources on the removal of TCE through dechlorination and on As solubilization and mobilization in response to carbon addition. The first set of columns (15. 2 cm diameter, 183 cm long) used whey, Newman Zone® standard <b>surfactant</b> <b>emulsified</b> oil, Newman Zone® nonionic <b>surfactant</b> <b>emulsified</b> oil, and no carbon controls as carbon and energy sources and were fed for 7. 5 years. The second set (7. 62 cm diameter and length) used whey, lactate, and no carbon control as carbon sources with columns being dismantled and analyzed over a 5 -month time period. These studies showed that reducing conditions, caused by the carbon sources, was the driving force for As mobilization as As(V) was reduced to the more mobile As(III). Total As mass in the sediment was lost with all carbon treatments within the first study with whey having a greater loss; however, within the second study, both whey and lactate treatments had the same extent of As mass loss over time.

Column effluent was monitored for TCE and its degradation products, redox indicators (nitrate-N, Fe(II), sulfate), and changes in iron mineralogy. Total bacteria and Dehalococcoides mccartyi strains were quantified using q-PCR. Complete dechlorination was only observed in the whey treated columns, occurring 1 year after bioaugmentation with addition of a culture known to dechlorinate TCE to ethene, and 3 years later in the non-bioaugmented column. The addition of the emulsified oils with or without bioaugmentation resulted in dechlorination only through cis-DCE and vinyl chloride. While Dehalococcoides mccartyi strains are the only known bacteria that can fully dechlorinate TCE, their presence, either natural or augmented, was not the sole determiner of complete dechlorination. The establishment of a supporting microbial community and biogeochemistry that developed with continuous feeding of whey, in addition to the presence of D. mccartyi, were necessary to support complete reductive dechlorination. Results confirm that careful selection of a biostimulant is critical to the success of TCE dechlorination in complex soil environments. © 2015, National Ground Water Association...|$|R
5000|$|Emulsion {{polymerization}} {{is a type}} {{of radical}} polymerization that usually starts with an emulsion incorporating water, monomer, and surfactant. The most common type of emulsion polymerization is an oil-in-water emulsion, in which droplets of monomer (the oil) are <b>emulsified</b> (with <b>surfactants)</b> in a continuous phase of water. Water-soluble polymers, such as certain polyvinyl alcohols or hydroxyethyl celluloses, {{can also be used to}} act as emulsifiers/stabilizers. The name [...] "emulsion polymerization" [...] is a misnomer that arises from a historical misconception. Rather than occurring in emulsion droplets, polymerization takes place in the latex particles that form spontaneously in the first few minutes of the process. These latex particles are typically 100 nm in size, and are made of many individual polymer chains. The particles are stopped from coagulating with each other because each particle is surrounded by the surfactant ('soap'); the charge on the surfactant repels other particles electrostatically. When water-soluble polymers are used as stabilizers instead of soap, the repulsion between particles arises because these water-soluble polymers form a 'hairy layer' around a particle that repels other particles, because pushing particles together would involve compressing these chains.|$|R
25|$|When {{surfactants}} {{are present}} above the {{critical micelle concentration}} (CMC), they can act as emulsifiers that will allow a compound that is normally insoluble (in the solvent being used) to dissolve.

After extracting Hg from samples it was quantified in the extracts by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS), employing a laboratory-made gas–liquid separator (GLS) and NaBH 4 as reducing agent. The extraction of Hg from samples was carried out by extraction induced by emulsion breaking (EIEB), which is based on the formation and breaking of water-in-oil emulsion between the oil samples and an extractant solution containing an <b>emulsifying</b> agent (<b>surfactant)</b> and nitric acid. Operational parameters of the GLS were evaluated in order to set the best performance of the measurement system. In these studies it was proven that the volume of sample and the concentration of HCl added to the sample extracts had significant influence on Hg response. The best conditions were achieved by adding 0. 5 mL of a 0. 3 molL− 1 HCl solution on 1 mL of sample extract. The extraction conditions were also optimized. The highest efficiency was observed when 4 mL of a solution containing 2. 5 % triton X- 100 and 15 % v/v HNO 3 were employed for the extraction of Hg contained in 20 mL of sample. Emulsion breaking was performed by heating at 80 °C and took approximately 20 min.

40|$|One {{remediation}} {{option for}} metal contaminated soil {{is to consider}} the use of waste containing soils to serve as aggregate for construction purposes.

The incorporation of petroleum contaminated soils into asphalt for reuse is becoming more common.

The literature related {{to this type of}} extractor and the relevant phenomena of droplet break-up and coalescence, drop size and drop mass transfer have been reviewed. The method of treatment in local refineries has been investigated and it is observed that the {{primary and secondary}} processes are quite efficient, but the tertiary process leaves some of the oil in he effluent and this is why the treated water is not recycled and reused. The treated waste/oil water is pumped into ponds for evaporation leaving the oil and other less volatile components as a residue which {{have a negative impact on}} the environment. The system of oil in water is not a normal solute-solvent system, and to make it so the mixture has been <b>emulsified</b> with a <b>surfactant</b> producing a partially water miscible emulsion.

The concentration profile has been measured and the overall experimental mass transfer coefficients were calculated from the mean driving force using Simpson's rule. It is observed that drop size, drop size distribution and mass transfer coefficients were strongly dependent on the speed of agitation. As the oil droplets were composed of emulsified oil in water and the oil itself is completely immiscible in water, the direction of mass transfer was from the emulsified droplets to the dispersed phase.

40|$|The {{processing}} of oil sands {{results in the}} production and storage of significant amounts of waste materials, including: large volumes affine tailings from the separation of bitumen from oil sands and petroleum coke produced during the bitumen upgrading process. In several previous investigations we explored the production of potentially marketable products from these wastes. This paper is a review of work from the authors' laboratory. Several case studies illustrate the potential uses for coke and value added products separated from fine tailings. Delayed and fluid coke from bitumen upgrading are effective sorbents for both bitumen and naphtha. They are also excellent collectors for heavy metals. Based on these properties and a plentiful supply at relatively low cost, these materials provide an excellent medium for treating oil-in water emulsions, for adsorbing oil spills. for heavy metal trapping in the purification of industrial effluents, {{for the treatment of}} oily waters, for extracting hydrocarbons from ground water and/or the removal of odors. Our work relating to the incorporation, or coating, of coke particles with lime or limestone is beneficial in the use of this material as an ancillary fuel with much reduced sulphur dioxide emissions. The ash from the combustion of coke can be leached to separate heavy metals. The leached residue could have potential applications as a flocculant for the treatment of fine tailings and possibly for the remediation of acid mine drainage. The fine tailings are separable into several potentially valuable by-products such as: bitumen for production of synthetic crude oil or as an ancillary fuel, clean kaolin for fine paper coating, a gelling agent, <b>emulsifying</b> solids for <b>surfactant</b> replacement and a mineral fraction rich in heavy metals.

30|$|Microbial {{surfactants}} are amphiphilic molecules which exhibit high {{surface activity}} and <b>emulsifying</b> properties. Microbial <b>surfactants</b> can be potential substitutes to chemical surfactants {{due to their}} stability under extreme conditions, structural diversity, low toxicity and biodegradability. BS are commonly employed in crude oil recovery (Banat et al. 2010) hydrocarbon degradation in soil (Nitschke et al. 2011; Saharan et al. 2011; Sharma and Singh 2014; Saharan et al. 2014) heavy metals removal from contaminated soil (Juwarkar et al. 2007) and hydrocarbon biodegradation in aquatic environment (Khire 2010). Surface interactions are mediated by the amphiphilic nature of the molecules consists of hydrophilic regions (acid, peptide cations, or anions, mono-, di- or polysaccharides) and hydrophobic regions (unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon chains or fatty acids), which allow them to act as surfactants at the interfaces (Banat et al. 2010; Myers 2005). The availability of commercially produced BS are limited to surfactin, sophorolipids and rhamnolipids (Saharan et al. 2011). Lactobacillus spp. are potent BS producing microorganism predominately found in the gastrointestinal microflora of human and animals. BS derived from lactic acid bacteria contributes to their high attributes of prevention of bacterial infections {{in the human body}} (Gudina et al. 2011). A number of studies reported the potential of lactobacilli as BS producers and their significant role in public health (Velraeds et al. 1996; Heinemann et al. 2000; Rodrigues et al. 2004; Servin 2004; Rodrigues et al. 2006 a, b; Falagas and Makris 2009; Augustine et al. 2010; Saravanakumari and Mani 2010; Thavasi et al. 2011; Gudina et al. 2011; Saharan et al. 2011; Rodriguez-Pazo et al. 2013; Moldes et al. 2013). Silicone rubber material is extensively used in sophisticated medical instruments and voice prostheses due to its ease of casting and exceptional mechanical properties. But the hydrophobic silicone rubber surfaces becomes colonized with biofilm forming pathogens including bacterial and yeast strains (Monteiro et al. 2011). Hydrophobic silicone rubber surface becomes colonized by a variety of bacterial and yeast strains (Neu et al. 1990). Laryngectomized patient encountered problems associated with biofilms formation on silicone rubber surfaces. Biofilm formation associated with severe problems once the biofilm formation has prolonged. Blocking and leakage due to biofilm formation affect the function of the device and need to be change regularly (Busscher and Van der Mei 1997). Application of BS to a surface modifies its hydrophobicity, interferes microbial adhesion and desorption processes; in that sense, the production of BS by probiotic bacteria in vivo can be considered as a defense against other colonizing food borne pathogens (Van Hoogmoed et al. 2000; Nitschke et al. 2009). BS coating decreases the contact angle of silicone surface and it becomes hydrophilic (Rodrigues et al. 2006 a). BS derived by lactic acid bacteria impaired biofilm formations on silicone rubber and other biomedical instruments surfaces (Velraeds et al. 1996; Busscher et al. 1997; Velraeds et al. 1997; Velraeds et al. 2000; Van der Mei et al. 2000; Rodrigues et al. 2004; Walencka et al. 2008; Fracchia et al. 2010; Gudina et al. 2011). The present work describes the production of novel BS produced by LAB isolates from butter milk. The current study also includes functional, structural and cytotoxic characterization of the BS produced.

40|$|Interfacial {{properties}} of dodecyl-Î²-d-maltoside (DDM) and dodecyl-Î²-d-fructofuranosyl-Î±-d-glucopyranoside (DFG) are being explored {{at both the}} air/water and dodecane/water interfaces. While surface tensiometry was employed {{for the study of}} the air/water interface, the dynamic drop volume technique was used to explore the oil/water (o/w) interface. Both surfactants are water soluble and non-ionic in nature. These surfactants differ slightly in their head group composition, whereas the structure of their alkyl tail is identical with same number of CH 2 groups in it. Therefore they differ slightly in head group polarity, and therewith in HLB (hydrophilic-lipophillic balance) value. This difference in HLB value of these surfactants is strongly reflected in their surface and interfacial properties, for the same bulk surfactant concentration DDM with less polar head group and HLB value of 13. 35 showed a slightly greater degree of surface and interfacial tension reduction compared to DFG with HLB value of 13. 5. This small difference in head group polarity is not only reflected in difference in critical micelle concentration (cmc) and surface tension reduction at cmc, but it is strongly manifested in both the dynamic and equilibrium interfacial tension profiles of these surfactants. Since the hydrophobic tail of both surfactants is same, it is evident that head group polarity (HLB value) of these surfactants played a great role in both the surface and interfacial tension reduction (adsorption at the surface and at oil/water interface), and therewith in adsorption kinetics and rate of diffusion from the bulk solution to the liquid-liquid interface. Since the equilibrium interfacial tension-log concentration Î³ eq - Î³ 0 (log C) profiles of these surfactants did not show any depression in interfacial tension at the neighborhood of cmc and since the interfacial pressure-log concentration dÏ�(d log C) profiles of these surfactants shows a linear relation with a regression coefficient exceeding 0. 99, it is assumed that both surfactants were relatively free from surface-active impurities in accordance to Lunkenheimer. Since the bulk concentration tested here exceeded cmc in both case, the equilibrium interfacial tension versus concentration profiles of these surfactants were evaluated using Langmuir-Szyszkowski type isotherm. Also, the Î�Gcmc 0 value of these surfactants is much higher than their Î�Gad 0 value, the fact that enables us to assume that the adsorption is favored over micellization. As far as diffusion coefficient (D) is concerned, the D of these surfactants decreased with increasing bulk concentration, suggesting that kinetics effects are probably beginning to compete with diffusion-controlled transport mechanism. This suggests that diffusion-controlled mechanism alone cannot fully describe the transport of surfactant mass from the bulk solution into the o/w interface, and that the diffusion-controlled mass transport mechanism is probably kinetically hindered. While the D decreased with bulk surfactant concentration in both cases, the less polar DDM showed a slightly smaller D compared to DFG, implying that as an emulsifying agent the former glycolipid would perform slightly better than the latter. The D of both the DDM and DFG was calculated to be of the order of 10 - 10 m 2 /s, suggesting that emulsifying property of these surfactants is comparable to most commercially available non-ionic surfactants. The magnitude of D further indicate that adsorption kinetics of these surfactants from the subsurface to the given o/w interface is slow, which in turn suggests that adsorption of these surfactant at the given o/w interface is cooperative, that as <b>emulsifying</b> agents these <b>surfactants</b> can perform as good as most commercially available surfactants...|$|R
