5|$|Another fleet advance {{followed}} on 18–20 October, {{though it}} ended without encountering any British units. Two weeks later, on 4 November, <b>Kaiser</b> {{took part in}} an expedition to the western coast of Denmark to assist two U-boats— and —that had become stranded there. On 1 December, the High Seas Fleet was reorganized; <b>Kaiser</b> and her sisters were transferred to the newly created IV Battle Squadron, with <b>Kaiser</b> as the flagship. In 1917, the policy of unrestricted submarine warfare was reinstated; the surface units of the German navy were therefore tasked with covering the departures and arrivals of the U-boats. As a result, <b>Kaiser</b> {{spent most of the}} year on picket duty in the German Bight. In May 1917, <b>Kaiser</b> went into the dock for periodic maintenance.|$|E
5|$|By 1911, {{the fleet}} was reorganized as the Hochseeflotte (High Seas Fleet), and new {{dreadnought}} battleships {{were beginning to}} enter service. As a result, the <b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich III-class ships were transferred to the III Squadron and then placed into reserve. In 1914, with the outbreak of World War I, the five ships were recalled to active duty {{and placed in the}} V Squadron of the fleet. In February 1915, the ships were withdrawn from active service for a second time. The ships were disarmed by 1916 and transferred to secondary roles. <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm der Grosse became a torpedo training ship and <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II became the headquarters ship for the commander of the High Seas Fleet in Wilhelmshaven. The other three ships were used as floating prisons. In 1917, <b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich III was transferred to barracks ship duties in Flensburg. All of the ships, with the exception of <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II, were stricken from the navy register on 6 December 1919 and sold for scrapping. <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II followed on 17 March 1921. By 1922, all five ships had been broken up for scrap metal. The bow ornaments from <b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich III and <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II are preserved at the Militärhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr in Dresden.|$|E

The ship was launched on 19 March 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 13 February 1875. <b>Kaiser</b> cost the German government 8,226,000gold marks.|$|E

5|$|On 1 November 1900, <b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich III {{replaced}} <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II as the I Squadron flagship; the latter, as {{the fleet}} flagship, remained {{assigned to the}} squadron for tactical purposes. From 4 to 15 December, <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II and the I Squadron went on a winter training cruise to Norway; the ships anchored at Larvik from 10 to 12 December. At 01:30 on 2 January 1901, she was steaming from Danzig to Kiel with <b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich III when the latter struck an underwater obstacle. The shock from the collision damaged the ship's boilers and started {{a fire in the}} coal bunkers. <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II took her sister in tow, although the engines on <b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich III were restarted along the way. The ships eventually reached Kiel, where temporary repairs were conducted. <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II went into drydock in January 1901 for overhaul and some modernization work. This included the reconstruction of a larger bridge and the removal of some of her searchlights. While the ship was laid up, Admiral Hans von Koester replaced Hoffmann as the fleet commander, a position he would hold until the end of 1906.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November, Vizeadmiral Prince Heinrich, who had {{replaced}} Hoffmann as the I Squadron commander, raised his flag aboard <b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich III; the ship held the role as squadron flagship {{for the next}} three years, interrupted only during the annual fleet exercises conducted in August and September, when Admiral Hans von Koester, the Generalinspekteur der Marine (Inspector-General of the Navy), commanded the fleet from <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II. Through November, the ships of the squadron were occupied with individual training. On 17 November 1900, <b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich III was steaming to Kiel after conducting training exercises. <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II attempted to pass <b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich III, so the latter stopped and allowed the former to pass to port. However, the order to resume steaming was given too quickly, and the ship accidentally rammed <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II. <b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich III suffered minor damage to her bow, while her sister was slightly damaged in the compartment that housed the steering engines. Repairs were completed within three days, without the need for either vessel to enter drydock. On 4 December, the ships began a winter training cruise, during which they stopped in Larvik, Norway, from 10 to 12 December. The squadron returned to Germany three days later.|$|E

5|$|When <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II was {{commissioned}} into the fleet, she assumed {{the position of}} fleet flagship; she held this position until 1906. The other four ships joined her in the I Squadron of the Heimatflotte (Home Fleet), where they remained for ten years. The five ships took part in extensive training maneuvers in September 1902 {{with the rest of}} the fleet. Throughout the maneuvers the <b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich III-class ships operated as the opposing force, with the exception of <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II. As the fleet flagship, <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II hosted Wilhelm II during several of the mock engagements and served as the observation point for the senior staff.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, <b>Kaiser</b> {{had fired}} 224 heavy battery and 41 {{secondary}} battery shells; Kaiserin fired 160 and 135 respectively, Prinzregent Luitpold fired 169 and 106 respectively, and Friedrich der Grosse fired 72 and 151 shells, respectively. <b>Kaiser</b> was hit twice by heavy-caliber shells during the battle, the only ship {{of the class}} to have been hit; however the ship only suffered a single wounded casualty.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, <b>Kaiser</b> Barbarossa and her sisters were mobilized as coastal defense ships in the V Battle Squadron and assigned to the North and Baltic Seas. She saw no combat during the war and, due to a shortage of crews, the ships were withdrawn from active duty in February 1915 and relegated to secondary duties. <b>Kaiser</b> Barbarossa was briefly used as a torpedo target ship for most of 1915 and thereafter spent {{the remainder of the}} war as a prison ship in Wilhelmshaven. Following {{the end of the war}} in 1918, <b>Kaiser</b> Barbarossa was decommissioned and sold for scrap metal. The ship was broken up in 1919–20.|$|E

5|$|From 3 to 29 April 1911, {{the ship}} participated in {{maneuvers}} off Rügen. Together with the North Sea reserve division, <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II {{and her sister}} ships went on a training cruise to Norway, starting on 8 June. During the visit, she stopped in Arendal, Bergen, and Odda. In July, the ship conducted gunnery training near the northern coast of Holstein, followed by training cruises {{off the coast of}} Mecklenburg. <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II served as the flagship of the III Squadron, which was organized for the autumn maneuvers in August. The III Squadron was attached to the High Seas Fleet for the maneuvers, which lasted from 28 August to 11 September. The following day, the III Squadron was disbanded and <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II returned to service with the Baltic reserve division. In February 1912, <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II was sent to the Fehmarn Belt to assist in freeing several freighters that were stuck in ice. She and her sisters were again decommissioned on 9 May, and remained out of service until 1914.|$|E
5|$|In January 1902, <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II {{went into}} dock at Wilhelmshaven for her annual overhaul. In mid-March, Wilhelm II and his wife, Augusta Victoria, came aboard {{the ship and}} waited {{in the mouth of}} the Elbe for Wilhelm's brother Prince Heinrich, who was {{returning}} from the United States. The I Squadron then went on a short cruise in the western Baltic before embarking on a major cruise around the British Isles, which lasted from 25 April to 28 May. Individual and squadron maneuvers took place from June to August, interrupted only by a cruise to Norway in July. During these maneuvers, three of <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm IIs boiler tubes burst, but the damage was repaired by the start of the autumn maneuvers in August. These exercises began in the Baltic and concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the Jade. <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II took no active part in the exercises; she instead served as an observation ship for the commander of the fleet, as well as her namesake, <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II. The regular winter cruise followed during 1–12 December.|$|E
5|$|In May 1888, <b>Kaiser</b> {{represented}} Germany at Barcelona's World Fair, {{which held}} a naval review. During {{the summer of}} 1889, <b>Kaiser</b> joined the fleet that steamed to Great Britain to celebrate the coronation of <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II; the ship joined her sister Deutschland and the turret ships Preussen and Friedrich der Grosse in the II Division. The fleet then held training maneuvers in the North Sea under command of Rear Admiral Friedrich Hollmann. <b>Kaiser</b> {{and the rest of}} the II Division became the training squadron for the fleet in 1889–1890, the first year the Kaiserliche Marine maintained a year-round ironclad force. The squadron escorted Wilhelm II's imperial yacht to the Mediterranean; the voyage included state visits to Italy and the Ottoman Empire. The squadron remained in the Mediterranean until April 1890, when it returned to Germany.|$|E

5|$|In October, Diederichs {{planned to}} rotate his ships through repair {{facilities}} in the region for periodic maintenance; Prinzess Wilhelm was scheduled to dock in Shanghai. He requested permission to take Prinzess Wilhelm and <b>Kaiser</b> to Kiaochou for autumn gunnery training and to leave Prinzess Wilhelm stationed there during the winter, which was denied. Diederichs {{was able to make}} use of the murder of a pair of German priests on 6 November in Shangtung, however, to justify his move against Kiaochou. At the time, the only ships available for the attack were Prinzess Wilhelm and <b>Kaiser.</b> Cormoran joined the two ships after a few days, and by 10 November, the ships were ready. Prinzess Wilhelm left port on the 11th, to rendezvous with <b>Kaiser</b> and Cormoran at sea.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich III was {{extensively}} modernized in 1908; her secondary {{guns were}} reorganized and her superstructure was cut down to reduce top-heaviness. After returning to service in 1910, <b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich III {{was placed in}} the Reserve Formation; she spent the next two years , being activated only for the annual fleet maneuvers. The years 1913 and 1914 passed without any active service until the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. Though obsolete, <b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich III and her sister ships served in a limited capacity as coastal defense ships in the V Battle Squadron in the early months of the war, tasked with defending Germany's North Sea coastline. The ships conducted two operations in the Baltic but did not encounter any hostile warships. By February 1915, <b>Kaiser</b> Friedrich was withdrawn from service and eventually decommissioned in November, thereafter being employed as a prison ship and later as a barracks ship. She was scrapped in 1920.|$|E
5|$|<b>Kaiser</b> Karl VI {{spent the}} first decade in service {{rotating}} between the training and reserve squadrons, alternating with Sankt Georg. In 1910, <b>Kaiser</b> Karl VI went on a major overseas cruise to South America, visiting Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina; {{this was the last}} trans-Atlantic voyage of an Austro-Hungarian warship. After the outbreak of war, she was mobilized into the Cruiser Flotilla, which spent the majority of the war moored at Cattaro. The lengthy inactivity eventually led to the Cattaro Mutiny in February 1918, which the crew of <b>Kaiser</b> Karl VI joined. After the mutiny collapsed, <b>Kaiser</b> Karl VI and several other warships were decommissioned {{to reduce the number of}} idle sailors. After the war, she was allocated as a war prize to Britain and was sold to ship-breakers in Italy, where she was scrapped in 1920.|$|E

5|$|<b>Kaiser</b> {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} until 1896, though she was frequently placed in reserve throughout her career. The ship was a regular participant in the annual fleet training maneuvers conducted {{with the exception of}} the mid-1880s, when she was temporarily replaced by newer vessels. She participated in several cruises in the Baltic and Mediterranean, often escorting <b>Kaiser</b> Wilhelm II on official state visits. <b>Kaiser</b> was rebuilt in the early 1890s as an armored cruiser, though she was too slow to perform satisfactorily in this role. Nevertheless, she spent several years as the flagship of the East Asia Squadron before returning to Germany in 1899. She was used in secondary roles after 1904, until after the end of World War I in 1919, when she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
