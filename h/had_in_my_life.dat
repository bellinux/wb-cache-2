500|$|..... {{we turned}} off the dusty French road, through a gateway and into a meadow beside the {{buildings}} of a farm. I saw {{with one of the}} nastiest feelings I have ever <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> two heavy machine guns inside the meadow ... pointing at the head of our column. The guns began to spit fire ... for a few seconds the cries and shrieks of our stricken men drowned the crackling of the guns. Men fell like grass before a scythe ... I felt a searing pain and pitched forward ... my scream of pain mingled with the cries of my mates, but even before I fell into the heap of dying men, the thought stabbed my brain 'If I ever get out of here, the swine that did this will pay for it.' ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} the long range shoot at Vieques, Iowas new {{executive}} officer, Commander John Morse, directed a main battery drill, {{over the objections of}} his gun crews, in which Turrets One and Two fired while both were pointed 15° off the starboard side of the ship's bow. At this angle, one of Turret Two's guns was firing over Turret One. During the shoot, according to Turret Two's left gun captain, Jack Thompson, one of the powder bags in the left gun began to smolder before the breechlock was closed. Thompson said that he was barely able to close and latch the breechlock before the gun discharged on its own. The concussion from Turret Two's guns shredded Turret One's gun bloomers (the canvas covers {{at the base of the}} main gun barrels) and damaged Turret One's electrical system. Dan Meyer said of the shoot that it was [...] "the most frightening experience I have ever <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> The shock wave blew out the turret officer's switchboard and the leads. We had no power, no lights for a time. Men were screaming. There was panic." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} in five Glee episodes {{over the course}} of the first season, O'Malley was upgraded to a series regular along with Heather Morris and Naya Rivera in the show's second season. Murphy confirmed this fact on July 13, 2010, in the wake of O'Malley's nomination for an Emmy Award for his work in the role of Burt. He appeared in eight season two episodes, and is guaranteed at least six episodes during the third season. In early 2011, O'Malley was cast in the lead role in a comedy pilot entitled Family Album, which prompted media speculation that his role as Burt might need to be reduced. In actuality, the actor ensured that he would be able to meet his six-episode commitment to Glee should the pilot be picked up for a full series run, and commented: [...] " [...] is one of the best parts I've ever <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I don’t want to leave it behind until it's run its course or the story has run its course." [...] On August 11, 2011, Fox announced that Family Album would not be made into a series. Although there was no announcement about a change in O'Malley's status on Glee, the press release for the first episode of the show's third season omitted O'Malley's name from the regular cast, and the one for the second episode has him listed as part of the guest cast.|$|E

2500|$|Khouri is a screenwriter, director, producer, feminist, lecturer, {{and author}} of non-fiction. She also worked as an actress, lecturer, and waiter in Nashville. While working {{for a company that}} made {{commercials}} and music videos, she began writing Thelma & Louise, her first produced screenplay. Thelma & Louise won Khouri the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, a Golden Globe Award, and a PEN Literary Award, as well as the London Film Critics Circle Award for Film of the Year and a nomination for Best Original Screenplay from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. According to an interview done by David Konow, a scholarly author and journalist, Callie Khouri mentioned her experience filming her first major film, Thelma & Louise. “While I was writing Thelma and Louise, it was the most fun I had ever <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> bar none,” she says. “It was such a pure experience. There was no self-censorship there, there was no second guessing. From a creative standpoint, it was the freest I had ever been in my life. I loved every moment I got to spend time with those characters. Nothing came close to it, including winning all the awards and everything else. As much fun as all that was, it wasn’t as much fun as sitting alone in a crummy office on Vine at 2 in the morning writing that screenplay.” At the Oscar ceremony she said, [...] "for everyone who wanted to see a happy ending for 'Thelma and Louise', for me this is it," [...] brandishing the statue high. After winning the Academy Awards for her best screenplay, she felt motivated enough to continue on with her career and express [...] "her feelings about the lack of female directors in Hollywood", not to mention that most of her career began because of her stand on women's rights. In an interview done by The Huffington Post, she addressed that adult women [...] "are a market that I feel is underserved in the entertainment population at large. I don’t see the kind of women represented that I know or that I’m attracted to. I really want to try to write more nuanced, less simplistic kind of stuff, and its hard {{to find a place to}} do that." ...|$|E
