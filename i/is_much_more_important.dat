25|$|As {{a result}} of this Supermom ideal, {{cultural}} contradictions of motherhood widely exist. Working mothers are often critiqued for being selfish and not spending enough time with their children. They defend their position by saying they work to support their children economically. Homemakers are often critiqued for not pursuing meaningful careers. They respond by saying that the childcare and other domestic work they do for their families <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important.</b> Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution for most women.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{forms of}} {{nitrogen}} {{are most often}} of concern with regard to eutrophication, because plants have high nitrogen requirements so that additions of nitrogen compounds will stimulate plant growth. Nitrogen is not readily available in soil because N2, a gaseous form of nitrogen, is very stable and unavailable directly to higher plants. Terrestrial ecosystems rely on microbial nitrogen fixation to convert N2 into other forms such as nitrates. However, {{there is a limit}} to how much nitrogen can be utilized. Ecosystems receiving more nitrogen than the plants require are called nitrogen-saturated. Saturated terrestrial ecosystems then can contribute both inorganic and organic nitrogen to freshwater, coastal, and marine eutrophication, where nitrogen is also typically a limiting nutrient. This is also the case with increased levels of phosphorus. However, because phosphorus is generally much less soluble than nitrogen, it is leached from the soil at a much slower rate than nitrogen. Consequently, phosphorus <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> as a limiting nutrient in aquatic systems.|$|E

Since he won the award before 1950, he was not required to offer it to the Academy first. Russell defended his decision, saying, [...] "I don't know why anybody would be critical.

To show this, he cited a study that attempted to measure the [...] "egregiousness" [...] of different crimes, finding that most death row inmates had not committed worse crimes then those sentence to life in prison. Rather, Breyer believed the race and gender of the victim <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important.</b> [...] Because fewer than 2% of counties account for all death sentences imposed nationwide, Breyer postulated that the real driver of inconsistent penalties are the local prosecutors, public defender funding, and race distribution. Criticizing the absence of proportionality review, Breyer goes on to cite several anecdotal examples from news media that he felt were particularly arbitrary.|$|E
2500|$|The quantum {{fluctuations}} of {{the electromagnetic}} field have important physical consequences. In addition to the Casimir effect, they also lead to a splitting between the two energy levels [...] and [...] (in term symbol notation) of the hydrogen atom which was not predicted by the Dirac equation, according to which these states {{should have the same}} energy. Charged particles can interact with the fluctuations of the quantized vacuum field, leading to slight shifts in energy, this effect is called the Lamb shift. The shift of about [...] is roughly [...] of the difference between the energies of the 1s and 2s levels, and amounts to 1,058MHz in frequency units. A small part of this shift (27MHz ≈ 3%) arises not from fluctuations {{of the electromagnetic}} field, but from fluctuations of the electron-positron field. The creation of (virtual) electron-positron pairs has the effect of screening the Coulomb field and acts as a vacuum dielectric constant.

However, they should not take off or land {{in the presence of}} wildlife and should avoid migratory routes, wildlife reserves, estuaries and other sites where birds may congregate. When operating in the presence of bird flocks, pilots should seek to climb above [...] as rapidly as possible as most birdstrikes occur below [...] Additionally pilots should slow down their aircraft when confronted with birds. The energy that must be dissipated in the collision is approximately the relative kinetic energy (...) of the bird, defined by the equation [...] where [...] is the mass of the bird and [...] is the relative velocity (the difference of the velocities of the bird and the plane, resulting in a lower absolute value if they are flying in the same direction and higher absolute value if they are flying in opposite directions). Therefore, the speed of the aircraft <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>important</b> than the size of the bird when it comes to reducing energy transfer in a collision.
