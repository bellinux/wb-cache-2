50|$|The {{principal}} {{difference between}} the BJT and HBT is {{in the use of}} differing semiconductor materials for the emitter-base junction and the base-collector junction, creating a heterojunction. The effect is to limit the injection of holes from the base into the emitter region, since the potential barrier in the valence band is higher than in the conduction band. Unlike BJT technology, this allows a high <b>doping</b> <b>density</b> {{to be used in the}} base, reducing the base resistance while maintaining gain.

50|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the use of the substrate surface chemistry is the ability to readily control the areal dose of the dopants by forming a mixed monolayer of ‘blank’ and dopant-containing molecules. For instance, a mixture of boron precursor molecules and dodecene (all-carbon ‘blank’ precursor) in different ratios is utilized to manipulate the areal dose of boron. Besides the mixed monolayer formation, the areal dose can be readily tuned by using the molecular structure details of the dopant precursor. In specific, the molecular footprint of the precursor directly governs the surface concentration of the dopants, with larger molecules resulting in a lower dose. In this regard, using trioctylphosphine oxide (TOP) as the phosphorus precursor with an approximately six-fold larger molecular footprint than DPP, the dopant dose can be modulated in the reduction of six times accordingly. Moreover, the doping profiles can be readily tuned through optimization of the annealing conditions. In this case, the high surface <b>doping</b> <b>density</b> with sharp spatial decay can be obtained by using this MLD method with low anneal temperatures and short times for the formation of USJs. The ability to controllably tune the dopant dose through the structural design of the precursor and to control the dopant profile by the annealing conditions present a unique aspect of the MLD process for attaining the desired dopant dose and profile.|$|E

The lack of progress so far made towards {{this is due to}} the fact that the requirements for an electrical injection and extraction device are quite different from those for an optical detection device [1]. The strong recombination in the direct-bandgap of III-V semiconductors hampers the effort to create an all electrical device. Therefore it would be interesting to investigate group IV systems to create an electrical spin injection and detection device.

By making use of the different bias dependence of the responsivity in both types of QWIPs a further enhancement of this factor is achieved. Nevertheless, both types of QWIPs show comparable detectivities. This is due to the fact that the gain has a negligible influence on the detectivity.

40|$|Abstract: In this article, we are {{discussing}} the Gauss’s law {{used to determine the}} width emitter extension region of the solar cell operating in open circuit condition. Taking into account the grain size (g), the grain boundary recombination velocity (Sgb) and the emitter <b>doping</b> <b>density</b> (Nemitter), the Gauss’s Law helped us to calculate the width emitter extension region of the solar cell operating in open circuit condition. To determine the width emitter extension region, we first showed that grain size (g), grain boundary recombination velociy (Sgb) are oppesite effects and concluded that best solar cells are characterized by low junction extension region width observed only with high grain size (g) and low grain boundary recombination velocity (Sgb). In a second way using Gauss’s law, we deduced that the ratio R of the width emitter extension region on the base extension region is equal to the ratio of the base <b>doping</b> <b>density</b> to emitter 15 − 3 <b>doping</b> <b>density.</b> We concluded that when N < 1. 5 ⋅ 10 cm, the ration R is practically emitter 16 − 3 16 − 3 constant and when 10 cm ≤ N emitter ≤ 5 ⋅ 10 cm the ration R variation is soft and we finely saw that the emitter contribution to the photoccurent can be neglected for emitter <b>doping</b> <b>density</b> greater than 10 17 cm- 3.
