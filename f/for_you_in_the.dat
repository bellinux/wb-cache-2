500|$|Seeing Ike Clanton in the Alhambra Saloon around midnight, Holliday confronted Ike, {{accusing him}} of lying about their {{previous}} conversations. They got into a heated argument. Wyatt Earp (who was not wearing a badge) encouraged his brother, Tombstone Deputy City Marshal Morgan Earp, to intervene. Morgan escorted Holliday {{out onto the street}} and Ike, who had been drinking steadily, followed them. City Marshal Virgil Earp arrived a few minutes later and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing. Ike and Wyatt talked again a few minutes later, and Ike threatened to confront Holliday in the morning. Ike told Earp that the fighting talk {{had been going on for}} a long time and that he intended to put an end to it. Ike told Earp, [...] "I will be ready <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning." [...] Wyatt Earp walked over to the Oriental Saloon and Ike followed him. Ike sat down to have another drink, his revolver in plain sight, and told Earp [...] "You must not think I won't be after you all in the morning." ...|$|E
500|$|Bond, already ambitious, asked Gilbert if {{he might}} be able to {{increase}} the size of her role. [...] Gilbert tried to mollify her in a letter, concluding, [...] "I am writing such a particularly good part <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new piece that I should be distressed beyond measure if you should leave us. I've never said as much as this to any actor or actress before. I don't say it to induce you to play so insignificant a part as Edith, for if you left us now, and came back to us to play that part, I should be satisfied. But if you didn't play it, my calculations would be all upset, and I should lose a dear little lady for whom I have always had a very special regard." [...] True to Gilbert's word, Edith was followed by a string of roles of increasing importance. [...] First was Lady Angela in Patience (1881–82). [...] Bond did not much like the role, writing later that she did not relate to the sentimental lady of luxury indulging in the aesthetic craze. At the same time, Bond was becoming known to theatregoers and attracting the attention of young men. [...] Having had such bad experiences with romance in the past, Bond ignored such attentions. [...] One poem sent to her by an admirer ran in mock-Gilbertian style as follows (in part): ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1926, {{while still}} in Charleston, Edson {{published}} his autobiography. He wanted to call it The Autobiography of an Ass and release it under his own name, but Brentano's, his publisher, overruled him on both counts. The book was published as The Great American Ass by Anonymous, {{with the idea that}} curiosity about the identity of the author would stimulate sales. In a 1928 letter to Robert Marks, a Charleston friend, Edson vented his frustration at how the book had been handled. [...] "It needs revision damn badly. For instance, Sam Ornitz edited the opening paragraph to say that “Wilber, Nebraska, is not to be found on any map, it is exotically discovered <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> works of Willa Cather…” The facts are, Wilber is the county seat of Saline County, and I was actually born there, and Willa Cather actually lived there at the same time. Sam supposed, of course, that I was just romancing. And without investigating, he announced there was no such town as Wilber, Saline County, Nebraska. All the critics knew better...therefore they concluded I was a liar in denying the existence of the town, a fool in not knowing the town existed, and finally, a coward in writing anonymously—all of which was not my fault at all." ...|$|E
