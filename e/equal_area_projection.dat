50|$|In 1908, Goode {{spoke at}} an American Association of Geographers meeting in Baltimore, USA about the {{creating}} {{an alternative to}} the “Evil Mercator” (Hass and Ward 244). The Mercator projection has severe distortion at the poles and northern latitudes. Goode merged the homolographic and sinusoidal projections at 40° 44’ 11.8” N and S to make the Goode Interrupted Homolosine projection (Stienwand 1). The “homolo” coming from homolographic, and the “sine” originating from sinusoidal. He calculated the latitude where the two projections had the same scale and therefore should be merged by overlaying the two projections on each other.Above and below 40° 44’ 11.8” N and S respectively, the homolographic projection is used. Between those two latitudes the sinusoidal projection is inserted. The Interrupted Homolosine projection is a pseudo-cylindrical, <b>equal</b> <b>area</b> <b>projection.</b> Initially, Goode’s Homolosine projection did not have universal appeal. The United States not being {{at the center of the}} map challenged the cartographic culture of the time (Schulten 187).|$|E

40|$|High {{resolution}} {{regional and}} global raster databases {{are currently being}} generated {{for a variety of}} environmental and scientific modeling applications. The projection of those data from geographic coordinates to a plane coordinate system is subject to significant variation and error based on the selected projection, the raster pixel size, and the specific latitude of the location being projected. While equal-area projections are designed to specifically preserve area, research shows that area preservation varies and selection of a projection for the resolution of the data is critical to developing accurate statistics of attributes such as land cover and elevation. In a comparison of four <b>equal</b> <b>area</b> <b>projections,</b> the Lambert azimuthal <b>equal</b> <b>area,</b> the Mollweide, the Goode homolosine, and the <b>equal</b> <b>area</b> cylindrical, results show that total areas of land cover vary with projection type and with raster resolution. While no single projection is best for all resolutions and at all latitudes, and any of the <b>equal</b> <b>area</b> <b>projections</b> tested are accurate with resolutions of eight kilometer pixels or smaller, the Mollweide appeared most accurate at larger pixel sizes. Analysis of the accuracy of raster projection was conducted by two methods. First, a set of twelve one by one degree squares placed at various latitudes were projected at several raster resolutions and compared to a projection of a vector representation of the same squares. Second, several different raster resolutions of land cover data for Asia were projected and the total areas of 21 land cover categories were tabulated and compared. The results indicate a variance in projection accuracy with latitude and among projection types...|$|R

Some conventional methods and the finite element method for the calculation of stress and displacement around a tunnel are referred to.

40|$|We {{developed}} a direct partitioning method {{to construct a}} seamless discrete global grid system (DGGS) with any resolution based on a two-dimensional projected plane and the earth ellipsoid. This DGGS is composed of congruent square grids over the projected plane and irregular ellipsoidal quadrilaterals on the ellipsoidal surface. A new <b>equal</b> <b>area</b> <b>projection</b> named the parallels plane (PP) projection derived from {{the expansion of the}} central meridian and parallels has been employed to perform the transformation between the planar squares and the corresponding ellipsoidal grids. The horizontal sides of the grids are parts of the parallel circles and the vertical sides are complex ellipsoidal curves, which can be obtained by the inverse expression of the PP projection. The partition strategies, transformation equations, geometric characteristics and distortions for this DGGS have been discussed. Our analysis proves that the DGGS is area-preserving while length distortions only occur on the vertical sides off the central meridian. Angular and length distortions positively correlate to the increase in latitudes and the spanning of longitudes away from a chosen central meridian. This direct partition only generates a small number of broken grids that can be treated individually...|$|E

40|$|The {{location}} of objects on the celestial sphere {{is a fundamental}} measurement in astronomy, {{and the distribution of}} these objects within the Milky Way is important for understanding their evolution as well as the large scale structure of the Galaxy. Here, physical concepts in Galactic astronomy are illustrated using straightforward mathematics and simplifying assumptions regarding the geometry of the Galaxy. Specifically, an analytical model for a smooth distribution of particles in an oblate ellipsoid is used to replicate the observed distributions of the Galactic coordinates for pulsars and supernova remnants. The distributions and the Lambert <b>equal</b> <b>area</b> <b>projections</b> (LEAPs) of the coordinates suggest that the dominant factors determining the general shape of the distributions are the heavy concentration of objects in the Galactic plane and the offset of the Galactic center from the coordinate system origin. The LEAPs and the distributions also show that the dispersion of pulsars about and along the plane are much larger than that for their progenitor supernovae. Additionally, the model can be used to derive an analytical expression for the dispersion measure along any line of sight within the Galaxy. The expression is used to create a hypothetical dispersion measure-distance map for pulsars in the Galaxy. Comment: 15 pages, 5 figures.
