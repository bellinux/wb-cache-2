500|$|Pujols began 2008 by {{reaching}} base in 42 straight games, the longest streak {{to open a}} season since Derek Jeter reached base in the first 53 games of 1999. On June 11, he {{was placed on the}} DL with a strained left calf muscle. Although he was expected to miss three weeks, he was activated from the DL on June 26. Pujols hit his 300th home run against Bob Howry on July 4 in a 2–1 loss to the Cubs. He said after the game that to him it was [...] "just another homer that goes out of the park. I'm happy to do it <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> fans—they were waiting for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded [...] "Earthling" [...] with a B. Unlike Isler, the A.V. Club {{reviewer}} {{loved the}} opening, calling it [...] "one of Fringes most effective freak-meets". Murray continued {{that he believed}} the episode to be [...] "an efficient action/adventure/horror hour, heavy on suspenseful moments and neat effects, light on character development and progress on the master-plot. When {{all is said and}} done and Fringe eventually ends its run, I'm betting that a newcomer will be able to skip 'Earthling' without putting a dent in their overall understanding of the show. But that doesn't mean it wasn't still cool to see people get reduced to dust right <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> eyes. Jane Boursaw from AOL TV responded negatively to the episode, wishing it had not been yet another [...] "stand-alone creature feature". While praising the special effects, Boursaw expressed disinterest in learning more about Broyles and compared the Fringe case to something already done in The X-Files. She concluded, [...] "Take the creepy alien factor out of it, and this could have been any other police procedural". UGO Networks reviewer Alex Zalben also noted similarities to The X-Files, writing that [...] "the reason [...] is weird for Fringe is that, aforementioned evidence aside, they’ve been very careful to avoid the overarching alien mythology X-Files is famous for. Oops." ...|$|E

6000|$|The groomsman he stared, and said, [...] "You must follow!" [...] But we'd gone {{to fiddle}} <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the party, (<b>Our</b> {{feelings}} as friends being true and hearty) And fiddle <b>in</b> <b>front</b> we did--all the way.|$|R
2500|$|Waters {{claimed in}} October 2017 that the U.S. Congress had enough {{evidence}} against Trump to 'be moving on impeachment', {{in reference to}} Russian collusion allegations during the 2016 Presidential election, and that Trump [...] "has openly obstructed justice <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> face." ...|$|E
2500|$|Our {{street was}} called Carr Street after my Father. We {{had a very}} nice house and a lovely garden... Carr Street was a very fine street. The dirt road waved {{up and down and}} in and out. the horses made it that way, zigzagging the carts and {{carriages}} through it. The rest of the street was green grass and wild roses. [...] <b>In</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> place Father had made a gravel walk but after our trees stopped there were just two planks to walk on.|$|E
2500|$|Just after noon, at 1235, the Germans {{launched}} their attack again, {{and they were}} pushed back by artillery and mortar fire. The result {{of the first day}} of what would become known as the Battle of the Bulge were 104 Germans dead [...] "in an area [...] yards <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> lines to [...] behind the line, and another 160 wounded counted in front of battalion lines." [...] The 3rd Battalion lost four killed, seven wounded, and four missing. [...] "We learned from a German Lieutenant prisoner of war that the enemy's mission was to take Höfen at all costs." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{felt this}} was the time to begin. We skipped between her and the door. We held <b>our</b> hat <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> us, cocked <b>our</b> head on one side, and said: [...] "Don't go! don't go!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Just {{two days}} after his return to duty we were making another advance. Spell was {{in one part of}} the field while I was in another. Suddenly I saw him running off to a place just <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> where <b>our</b> squad was located. Then he made a turn as if to come toward us, and just at that instant he threw up his hands and fell forward on his face." ...|$|R
50|$|On 25/26 September 1917 {{north of}} the Ypres-Menin Road, Belgium, great {{difficulty}} was experienced <b>in</b> keeping the <b>front</b> and support line supplied with small arm ammunition, owing to the intense artillery fire. At a time when this supply had reached a seriously low level, Lance-Corporal Hamilton on several occasions, on his own initiative, carried bondoliers of ammunition through the enemy's belts of fire and then, {{in full view of}} their snipers and machine-guns which were lying out <b>in</b> the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> line at close range, he distributed the ammunition.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fact that}} English has words like {{before and after}} that are (currently or archaically) polysemous between 'front/earlier' or 'back/later' may seem to refute the claims {{regarding}} Aymara uniqueness. However, these words relate events to other events and {{are part of the}} moving-events metaphor. In fact, when before means in front of ego, it can mean only future. For instance, our future is laid out before us while our past is behind us. Parallel Aymara examples describe future days as qhipa uru, literally 'back days', and they are sometimes accompanied by gestures to behind the speaker. The same applies to Quechua speakers, whose expression qhipa p'unchaw corresponds directly to Aymara qhipa uru. [...] Possibly, the metaphor is that the past is visible to us (<b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> eyes) while the future is not.|$|E
2500|$|Almost all the {{furniture}} and utensils from that era are still in place, as well as paintings and pictures belonging the original owners of this grand old home located directly <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lady of Guadalupe Cathedral, in the town square. The house is [...] easy to spot thanks to the two caryatids {{in the front of}} the house and its overall neoclassic architectural style. [...] With its gorgeous, neoclassical facade, the Casa Armstrong-Poventud is among the most stately and elegant houses in Ponce. Built in 1900 as the home for this Scottish banker, the house served as the regional office of the ICP for 15 years. [...] Casa Armstrong-Poventud building is a magnificent example of the neoclassical architectural heritage of the island. [...] The Residence was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on October 29, 1987.|$|E

5000|$|Rüttgers {{is widely}} {{known for his}} views on {{immigration}} and the much-discussed phrase [...] "Kinder statt Inder" [...] ("children instead of Indians") which was a media interpretation of [...] "Statt Inder an die Computer müssen unsere Kinder an die Computer" [...] ("instead <b>of</b> Indians <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> computers, <b>our</b> children must be <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> computers"), during an election campaign (which he eventually lost) {{at a time when}} there was a parallel nationwide discussion about whether or not immigration rules should be liberalised on behalf of attracting more highly qualified foreign academics to the German labor market.|$|R
5000|$|Glasser also posits a [...] "Comparing Place" [...] {{where we}} compare-contrast <b>our</b> {{perception}} <b>of</b> people, places, and things immediately <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> us against <b>our</b> ideal images (archetypes) <b>of</b> these in <b>our</b> Quality World framework. Our subconscious pushes us towards calibrating—as best we can—our real world experience with our Quality World (archetypes).|$|R
6000|$|Arrayed in the red-stained canvas {{coat and}} {{trousers}} of the mine, with a candle stuck <b>in</b> the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> very strong hats and three spare ones each hung at our breasts, we proceeded to the ladder-way. This {{was a small}} platform {{with a hole in}} it just big enough to admit a man, out of which projected the head of a strong ladder. Before descending Captain Jan glanced down the hole and listened to a distant, regular, clicking sound--like the ticking of a clock. [...] "A man coming up," [...] said he, [...] "we'll wait a minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will give}} Olly {{leave of absence}} {{for an hour or}} two daily to go and fish," [...] said the captain; [...] "that will keep us alive, coupled with what birds or beasts may come accidentally <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> arrows." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{night before}} we had sat <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> tents above the beach and watched the flying-fish come out in twos and threes and schools, {{all the way down}} the rugged coast. I told the captain then that {{swordfish}} were chasing them. But he was skeptical.|$|E
5000|$|Sir Bruce Greatbatch, KCVO, CMG, MBE, {{governor}} of the Seychelles, ordered all the dogs on Diego Garcia to be killed. More than 1000 pets were gassed with exhaust fumes. [...] "They put the dogs in a furnace where the people worked", Lisette Talatte, in her 60s, told me, [...] "and when their dogs were taken away <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them <b>our</b> children screamed and cried". Sir Bruce had been given responsibility for what the US called [...] "cleansing" [...] and [...] "sanitising" [...] the islands; and {{the killing of the}} pets was taken by the islanders as a warning.|$|R
40|$|In {{this feature}} essay, Derek Dunne draws {{attention}} to the hidden bureaucratic labour that is increasingly part of academic life. Rather than see this as the ‘white noise’ to be tuned out of everyday working practices, he calls for us to question the forms that are put <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> us demanding <b>our</b> acquiescence, whilst also locating potential sites of resistance...|$|R
40|$|The article {{departs from}} {{the premise that}} the {{scientific}} literacy of adults implies a background allowing them to participate in the communicative mode (Habermas, 1987) to take a decision on the scientific/technological advances that affect us. Starting from this definition we find that the mere conceptual learning does not ensure the improvement of this attitude for participation. It could even produce the contrary effect. When the instructive design contemplates these attitudes, the result improves, although other effects and deficiencies can appear: degree of generalization and anxiety <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> participation. <b>Our</b> proposal is that these aspects are also kept in mind in adult scientific education...|$|R

60|$|Now, {{few of us}} {{know the}} real life of the stage people. If we did, the {{profession}} might be more overcrowded than it is.

50|$|Yeah, it's real racing. That said, {{between the}} thick scrum <b>of</b> crapcans <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> you and <b>our</b> aversion to long, {{flat-out}} straightaways, you're {{not going to}} set any speed records.

Oh, and, you know, it's more dangerous.|$|R
60|$|At {{last the}} Tartars came on, and an innumerable company they were; how many {{we could not}} tell, but ten thousand, we thought, at the least. A party of them came on first, and viewed our posture, {{traversing}} the ground <b>in</b> the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> line; and, as we found them within gunshot, our leader ordered the two wings to advance swiftly, {{and give them a}} salvo on each wing with their shot, which was done. They then went off, I suppose to give an account of the reception they were like to meet with; indeed, that salute cloyed their stomachs, for they immediately halted, stood a while to consider of it, and wheeling off to the left, they gave over their design for that time, which was very agreeable to our circumstances.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{describe}} a reactive robot architecture that uses fast re-planning methods {{to avoid the}} shortcomings of reactive navigation, such as getting stuck in box canyons or <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> small openings. <b>Our</b> robot architecture differs from others in that it gives planning progressively greater control of the robot if reactive navigation continues to fail, until planning controls the robot directly. Our first experiments on a Nomad robot and in simulation demonstrate that our robot architecture promises to simplify the programming of reactive robot architectures greatly and results in robust navigation, smooth trajectories, and reasonably good navigation performance.

60|$|On {{the very}} day after I had written to Ada, an open {{carriage}} with a splendid pair of horses stopped <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> house, and a tall powdered footman got down, opened the gate and came down the little walk, with a rather mystified air, as if wondering what his mistress could possibly want at No. 1, Daisy Villas.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we develop a spatial model to explain local megers and {{acquisitions}} (M&As) in European retail banking systems as strategic reactions {{to changes in}} regulation and economic integration. We show that local banking concentration increases market power and contributes to build new barriers to entry. Local M&As yield positive social results in the first economic integration stages, but could damage welfare in more advenced stages in cases where they serve to safeguard price agreements <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> foreign competition. <b>Our</b> results seem to conform to experiences of most European banking markets {{during the last two}} decades. ...|$|R
60|$|Our {{carriage}} {{stopped at}} last at the place. I have a dim remembrance {{of a way}} being made for us through a great crowd all round the house, and of going with Mrs. Wardlaw up into a dressing room, where I met and shook hands with many friendly people. Then we passed into a gallery, where a seat was reserved for <b>our</b> party, directly <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the audience. <b>Our</b> friend Baillie Paton presided. Mrs. Wardlaw and I sat together, and around us many friends, chiefly ministers of the different churches, the {{ladies and gentlemen of}} the Glasgow Antislavery Society, and others.|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} National Security Statement to the Australian Parliament, Kevin Rudd {{referred}} to unregulated population movements associated with climate change {{as one of}} Australia's national security challenges. While exact figures are uncertain, up to 250 million people could be displaced by climate change by 2050. This is the equivalent to {{the entire population of}} Indonesia on the move throughout the globe. Tempting as it may be to view the complexity of climate-induced displacement through a security lens, such a perspective will be limited. Because although there are clearly important security implications at stake here the unofficial movement of millions or even {{hundreds of millions of people}} will challenge state, regional and international security this is not just a security issue. It is also a human issue. There is a need to respond not only with our national security apparatus, but also with the question of how we can provide protection <b>in</b> the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> minds...|$|R
