50|$|The {{beginnings}} of the Energy Charter date back to a political initiative launched in Europe in the early 1990s. The time at end of the Cold War offered an unprecedented opportunity to overcome previous economic divisions between the nations {{on both sides of}} the Iron Curtain. The clearest prospect for mutually co-dependent beneficial cooperation was the energy sector, given Europe's growing energy demand and vast resource availability in post-Soviet nations. Additionally there was a recognised need to ensure that a commonly accepted foundation was established for <b>developing</b> <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> among the states of Eurasia. On the basis of these considerations, the Energy Charter process was born.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{pursue a}} unified study on smart grid and coordinated {{multi-point}} (CoMP) enabled wireless communication by investigating a new joint communication and <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> approach. We consider a practical CoMP system with clustered multiple-antenna base stations (BSs) cooperatively communicating with multiple single-antenna mobile terminals (MTs), where each BS {{is equipped with}} local renewable energy generators to supply power and also a smart meter to enable two-way energy flow with the grid. We propose a new <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> paradigm, {{where a group of}} BSs dynamically share their renewable energy for more efficient operation via locally injecting/drawing power to/from an aggregator with a zero effective sum-energy exchanged. Under this new <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> model, we consider the downlink transmission in one CoMP cluster with cooperative zero-forcing (ZF) based precoding at the BSs. We maximize the weighted sum-rate for all MTs by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocations at cooperative BSs and their exchanged energy amounts subject to a new type of power constraints featuring <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> among BSs with practical loss ratios. Our new setup with BSs' <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> generalizes the conventional CoMP transmit optimization under BSs' sum-power or individual-power constraints. Finally, we validate our results by simulations under various practical setups, and show that the proposed joint communication and <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> scheme substantially improves the downlink throughput of CoMP systems powered by smart grid and renewable energy, as compared to other suboptimal designs without communication and/or <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Comment: to appear in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technolog...|$|R

40|$|With the {{deepening}} of economic globalization and {{regional economic integration}} and the “One Belt and One Road” strategic layout, China and Russia {{in the field of}} regional <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> has been expanded to deepen. This paper analyzed the present situation of <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> between China and Russia from the field of oil, coal and natural gas, and concludes that Sino-Russian <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> is the following factors: strong <b>cooperation</b> and strong <b>energy</b> complementarities, and then analyzed the way to the Sino-Russian oil and gas cooperation.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} the delay minimization problem in an energy harvesting communication network with energy coopera-tion. We investigate {{the problems of}} optimal energy management at each node and optimal energy routing between nodes through <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation.</b> For the case without <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation,</b> each node needs to distribute its harvested energy over its outgoing links. For this problem, we show that each node should allocate more power to links with more noise power and to links through which more data flow. For the case with <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation,</b> each node needs to distribute its harvested energy among its outgoing links, and in addition, each node may transfer a portion of its harvested energy to neighboring nodes through <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation.</b> For this problem, we develop an iterative algorithm to determine the optimal energy routes in the network. We numerically observe that energy is routed from nodes with lower data loads to nodes with higher data loads. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} the energy harvesting diamond channel, where {{the source and}} two relays harvest energy from nature, the relays help deliver the source’s messages via signal cooperation, and the source has the option of wirelessly transferring some of its energy to the relays via <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation.</b> We find the optimal offline transmit power allocations and energy transfer policies that maximize the end-to-end throughput. For the case of no <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation,</b> we decompose the problem into inner and outer maximization problems, and solve the overall problem iterating between the two. We show that the class of procrastinating policies, where energy is transferred only when it will be immediately used, is optimal. We then show that the problem with <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> is equivalent to a problem without <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> with suitably modified rate expressions. We show that, in this system, if the source sends more energy to a relay, then it sends less data, showing us how data and energy should flow together optimally in this network. I...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a model for}} <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> between {{cellular}} base stations (BSs) with individual hybrid power supplies (including both the conventional grid and renewable energy sources), limited energy storages, and connected by resistive power lines for energy sharing. When the renewable energy profile and energy demand profile at all BSs are deterministic or known ahead of time, we show that the optimal <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> policy for the BSs can be found by solving a linear program. We show the benefits of <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> in this regime. When the renewable energy and demand profiles are stochastic and only causally known at the BSs, we propose an online <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> algorithm and show the optimality properties of this algorithm under certain conditions. Furthermore, the energy-saving performances of the developed offline and online algorithms are compared by simulations, {{and the effect of}} the availability of energy state information (ESI) on the performance gains of the BSs' <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> is investigated. Finally, we propose a hybrid algorithm that can incorporate offline information about the energy profiles, but operates in an online manner. Comment: V 1 : Presented at IEEE WCNC 2013.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the prospects {{and challenges of}} <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> between the European Union (EU) and Turkey {{within the context of}} the Eastern Partnership (EaP). Part of the EaP agenda is to advance <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> between the EU and the partner states, particularly regarding the diversification of import routes. As an energy corridor between the EU and the hydrocarbon-rich Caspian states, Turkey is a strategic asset for European energy security. Turkey also has economic ties and political capital in the Caspian region that can help the EU reach out to its eastern partners. Despite robust incentives for cooperation, however, the EU-Turkey energy partnership has so far failed to meet mutual expectations. This article argues that this is primarily due to the inability of the two actors to credibly commit to regional <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Commitment problem stems from two factors. First, the predominance of national energy interests over communal ones undermines credible commitment. The variation in energy needs of Member States prevents the EU from acting in unison in external energy policy. Similarly, Turkey also prioritizes its own energy security, particularly in its relations with suppliers, which undermines cooperation with the EU. Second, the EU and Turkey hold divergent perspectives on the potential political payoffs of <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Turkish decision makers are convinced that <b>energy</b> <b>cooperation</b> warrants palpable progress in Turkey’s accession while most EU actors appear hesitant to establish a direct connection between energy and accession...|$|R
