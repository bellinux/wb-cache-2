50|$|The Ottoman Empire {{was noted}} {{for the quality}} of its gold- and silversmiths, and {{particularly}} for the jewelry they produced. Jewelry had particular importance as it was commonly given at weddings, as a gift that {{could be used as a}} form of savings. Silver was the most common material used, with gold reserved for more high-status pieces; designs often displayed complex filigree work and incorporated Persian and Byzantine motifs. Developments in design reflected the tastes of the Ottoman court, with Persian Safavid art, for example, becoming an influence after the Ottoman defeat of Ismail I after the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514. In the rural areas of the Empire, jewelry was simpler and often incorporated gold coins (the Ottoman altin), but the designs of Constantinople nevertheless spread throughout Ottoman territory and were reflected even in the metalwork of Egypt and North Africa. Most jewelers and goldsmiths were Christian Armenians and Jews, but the interest of the Ottomans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>related</b> <b>art</b> of watchmaking resulted in many European goldsmiths, watchmakers and gem engravers moving to Constantinople, where they worked in the foreigners' quarter, Galata.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Although it is, in principle, {{almost universally}} {{accepted}} today that authors and narrators must be rigorously demarcated, somehow scholars of Marcel Proust seem—whether wittingly or unwittingly—to {{make an exception}} for In Search of Lost me. Because it is written {{in the first person}} and because it incorporates scenes bor-rowed from Proust’s own life, the fictional narrative is routinely read as his thinly veiled autobiography, if not as evidence for any number of psychiatric disorders. At the very least, critics tend to have no hesitation in taking theses put forward by the narrator as Proust’s own vision {{of the world and the}} narrator’s future masterpiece as the Search itself. Now these are not only mistakes, as evidence both internal and external clearly shows, but also consequential mistakes: they prevent us, that is, from understanding how the novel functions and from taking advantage of all it has to offer. For above and beyond the dry, theoretical insights it presents for our consider-ation, it grants us the opportunity to train ourselves, both in the complicated art of self-fashioning and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>related</b> <b>art</b> of self-deception. And it is only because the nar-rator’s insights do not entirely add up—a weakness, so long as one treats the Search as a treatise—that the implied author can produce the training effect, one which gives his novel its ultimate strength. This essay, which (for the most part) is excerpted from the forthcoming book Philosophy as Fiction: Self, Deception, and Knowledge in Proust, is preprinted with the kind permission of Oxford University Press. I owe an immense debt of gratitude to Thomas Pavel, on grounds too numerous and too multifarious to list here.

5000|$|The Poetria nova is a 2,000-line poem written around 1210 in Latin hexameters and {{dedicated}} to Pope Innocent III. The Poetria nova aimed {{to replace the}} standard text on verse composition, Horace's Ars poetica called <b>the</b> Poetria <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages, which was widely read and commented upon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eleventh and twelfth centuries. Karsten Friis-Jensen suggests that Geoffrey of Vinsauf's [...] "main incentive for writing independent arts of poetry was probably a wish to systematize the exegetical material which generations of commentators had collected around Horace's text, in a structure that was in better accordance with traditional didactics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> closely <b>related</b> <b>art</b> of rhetoric" [...] (364). The medieval teacher intended to reshape the Ars poetica into an elementary textbook on composing poetry, [...] "modeled on the Ciceronian rhetorics and their medieval derivatives, such as the artes dictandi and the treatises on the colores rhetorici" [...] (Camargo 949). The Poetria nova almost immediately became one of <b>the</b> standard textbooks <b>in</b> England and was incorporated into the curriculum on the Continent very soon thereafter. To its popularity testifies the number of manuscripts (200) in which this work is found and extensive commentary, which takes form of marginal glosses around a text of the Poetria nova and a text copied separately by itself.|$|R

40|$|Jacek Zydorowicz – CONTEMPORARY ART PRACTICES AND THE SACRED SPHERE. FROM ATHEISTIC ANTIRELIGIOUS CRUSADES TO AGNOSTIC HERESIES OF DIALOGUE The {{world of}} secular {{art and the}} world of {{religious}} art are today the two divided fields, as well in their circulation and esthetic reflection. "Secular" artists did not resign from <b>relating</b> to <b>the</b> sacred sphere, often being close to blasphemy and insulting religious feelings. Many of such incidents did contribute to the perception of the world of secular and religious arts in terms of mutual aversion or even hostility. Not so far past shows however, that both types of cultural practices with a specific "prosperity of discourses" are able to create interesting symbioses. Such situations occur, when both art and religion become a censored phenomena, like for example during <b>the</b> communist era <b>in</b> Poland <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980 's. Artists and Catholic priests became efficient catalysts of social resistance. However, the time of transformation after 1989 had brought some significant changes; artists either had lost their interest in religious topics, or targeted a new discourse around the bounding of the sacred with poli-tics. <b>The</b> 1990 's <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Polish <b>arts</b> <b>related</b> to religious topics had past in an atmosphere of scandals, accusations of blasphemy, closing of exhibitions, preventive censorship etc. Does it bring the issue to an emptiness of <b>the</b> sacred <b>in</b> arts? On one hand we have today frightened curators avoiding the sensitive religious topics, and on the other blasphemic and transgressive strategies are no longer interesting to the artists themselves. It doesn't mean, that the sacred has been pushed out from the art totally and the tactics of provoking through religious iconography abandoned...|$|R
40|$|The {{judgement}} 'that {{person is}} musical' is commonplace {{in our daily}} lives. The present writer has grown up in an intellectual environment coloured to a marked extent by interest <b>in</b> music and <b>the</b> <b>related</b> <b>arts.</b> To him {{it had always been}} a very natural phenomenon that a person should be regarded as musical or 'not-musical', and it seems justifiable to state that has attitude was but typical of his fellow-men. There appears to have prevailed for some time the idea that musicality represented some 'innate permeating spirit' which distinguished the possessor of the 'musical spark' from his brethren of more common clay. This implied that certain human beings had some general musical capacity or 'turn of mind' which was not possessed by others. Is there any justification for such an assumption? It was a question such as this which first stimulated the writer's interest towards a scientific investigation of the problem of musicality. This interest was refreshed almost continuously by a consideration of a number of further questions inevitably bound up with the consequences of the initial problem: Of the musical individuals themselves, was it true to say that their musicality was evidenced homogeneously either in degree or in quality throughout different musical operations? Was, for example, the music student who was keenest at discrimination of pitch also best at the memorizing of his music? Could anything definite be stipulated, either on a priori grounds or on the basis of experience, about the relationship existing between one's musicality and one's general intelligence? And what of the so-called allied arts; did literary ability, for instance, likewise involve a special quality, and was this ichor the same as was to explain musicality? It was as an attempt to provide a scientifically-investigated answer to such and similar questions that this analysis was originally undertaken. At the time of writing the field of the problem was entirely virgin soil; and though the writer would like to feel that this world does take an appreciable step towards clearing the obstructing growths of ignorance on the subject, yet he is obliged to point out the severely limited nature of the scope ot this thesis, owing partly to the brevity of time at his disposal and partly to the amount of wasted labour attendant upon all "pioneer" endeavour...|$|R

Yes <b>the</b> children sing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kindergarten, but when do we as adults sing together? Singing has {{a wide range of}} personal benefits besides from learning about music and how to create it. As well as developing and improving healthy singing techniques and also being a thoroughly enjoyable experience it has also been shown to have multiple physiological and social benefits for the participants. Working with the voice has many physical benefits, such as improved posture and respiratory strength, increased energy levels and also stimulation for the mind. There are also many social and personal benefits, such as boosted self-esteem and confidence, improved communication and listening skills, raised self-awareness and awareness of others and developed team working skills. One area of communal activity that has received increasing attention is participative community singing, because it entails aerobic exercise, social interaction and promotion of sense of connectedness. We believe it may be a good avenue to increase sense of connectedness and to promote participation in exercise activities. In this special issue of the journal there is provided persuasive evidence to demonstrate the power of community singing in promoting social and emotional wellbeing, prevent depression, promoting healthy behaviours and promoting access to health services in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia. <b>In</b> addition <b>the</b> health effect of Tai Chi as another form of arts is also explored. The research address social and health practices that advocate the use of community singing program to build a capacity for health promotion in individuals and communities in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. As a whole it exemplify community singing projects that share common features aligned with a social ecological view of health, education and social work systems. Academics have collaborated with practitioners to produce the study results, all of which are quantitative that report on the effects of community singing practices for a marginalised population <b>in</b> Australia. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> presentations the connection between community singing and Tai Chi program and health promotion are explicitly addressed by posing the following questions-Do community singing projects in build a measurable capacity for health promotion and prevention amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people? Can we replicate these projects' outcomes to develop a capacity for health promotion and prevention in diverse cultural groups? Does Tai Chi help with the prevention of health problems in old people in Australia? One of the main avenues for addressing health issues in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is to create opportunities for participation, social support and development of connectedness and a sense of belonging to the community and trust in community. Given their strong preference to participate in arts and cultural activities as indicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study, <b>arts</b> <b>related</b> program development focusing on a combination of festivals, story telling, music, singing and dancing arts forms may have implications to encourage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to participate in these activities.
