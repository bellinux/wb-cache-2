40|$|Mechanistic force {{prediction}} models {{require a}} calibration phase {{to determine the}} cutting coefficients describing the tool–target material interaction. The model prediction performance depends on the experimental correctness and representativeness of input data, especially in micromilling, where <b>facing</b> <b>process</b> uncertainties is a big challenge. The present paper focuses on input data correctness introducing a clear and repeatable calibration experimental procedure based on accurate force data acquisitions. Input data representativeness has been directly connected to the calibration window choice, i. e., {{the selection of the}} space of process parameters combinations used to calibrate the model. Also, the model validation has to be carefully carried out to make the model significant: the present paper proposes a clear and repeatable validation procedure based on the model performance index calculation over the whole process operating window, i. e., the space of parameters where the process works correctly. An objective indication of the model suitability can be obtained by applying this procedure. Comparisons among prediction performances produced by different calibration windows are allowed. This paper demonstrates how the calibration window selection determines the model prediction performance, which seems to improve if calibration is carried out where forces assume high values. Some important considerations on the process parameters role on cutting forces and on the model capability have also been drawn from the model validation results...|$|E

Predicting and also preventing the overall damage caused by BaSO 4 precipitation requires a profound knowledge of its solubility under different thermodynamic conditions. The main {{aim of this study}} is to develop a solubility prediction model based on a hybrid of least squares support vector machines (LSSVM) and coupled simulated annealing (CSA) aiming to predict the solubility of barium sulfate over wide ranges of temperature, pressure and ionic compositions. Results indicate that predictions of the presented model are in well accordance with experimental measurements yielding overall correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0. 996 and total RMSE of 0. 00077. Constructed model was also found to outperform a previously well-known correlation employed for predicting BaSO 4 solubility in aqueous solutions. Solubility predictions based on Pitzer ion interaction model were also compared to CSA-LSSVM predictions in terms of single point estimations and sensitivity analysis.

40|$|Article {{considers}} {{various aspects}} of development of the nation-state {{in the time of}} modernity as well as implications for institutional settings of liberal democratic nation-state <b>facing</b> <b>process</b> of globalization and new mechanisms brought by the information society. On this basis situation of Europe and especially of the European Union, as a unique multi-cultural institutional structure, is examined taking into account especially question of European identity in contrast to cultural diversity of Europe. As a core matter this article argues that a solution for Europe could be in an attempt to redefine concept of identity of individual citizens of European states. Following Habermas' theory, this article explains that this new concept could be understood as forming a dual identity of citizen - one of its dimensions being universal political embedding in common values of the society, while the other one being rooted in cultural particularity of citizen's community, with possibility of connecting it to more cultural contexts. As the political dimension of the identity can never be completely separated from the cultural context from which it emerges, it must be emphasised that this level of identity must be understood as permanent process of democratic dialogue based on all representative cultural contexts of the society. New institutional structure of Europe must be based on three pillars in order to deal successfully with challenges of the information society and globalization: redefinition of identity of European citizens in terms of dual identity as mentioned above; actualisation of 64 educational systems in order to support this redefined content of citizenship; and finally activities to support possibilities of citizens' participation in the information society mechanisms, particularly support of the information literacy. ...|$|E
