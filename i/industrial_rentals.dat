40|$|A {{major cause}} of {{volatility}} in American real estate market cycles is the lag between demand growth and supply response. Cycles can be separated into four distinct phases based upon the rates of change in both supply and demand. Data of demand, supply, vacancy and gross asking rates {{were used to determine}} rental growth from 54 office markets and 54 industrial markets. The data supports the theory that office and <b>industrial</b> <b>rental</b> growth rates will be above inflation when markets have occupancy levels above their long term occupancy average (LTOA) and below inflation when markets have occupancy levels below their LTOA. In the first decade in the new millennium most economists predict moderate but stable demand growth. The supply of space will be more restricted than in previous cycles. This real estate cycle is driven by declining demand, not oversupply. High profits may no longer become available as real estate markets become more efficient. ...|$|R

40|$|Montreal {{serves as}} an {{illustration}} of how loft landscapes outside of Manhattan draw from the landscape discourse of SoHo, but are inscribed with local economic, political and cultural attributes. Two aspects of the reconstruction of loft landscapes are highlighted: the imagery of the loft {{in the mass media}} and the role of local residents in interpreting and reconstructing the loft concept in the Montreal rental market. A description of the local impact of economic restructuring on the built environment of the inner city sets the stage for an examination of two groups of residents. The industrial built environment in Montreal suffers from disinvestment and lack of regulation making the rental sector loft a readily available housing choice in the inner city. Undefined and outside of municipal regulations, lofts are domestic spaces in which tenants can construct identities. Artists, who use industrial spaces to combine home and work (Loft Artists) and non-artists, who use appropriate <b>industrial</b> spaces as <b>rental</b> housing (Loft Dwellers) are the two primary groups to occupy these spaces. A comparison between these two groups, their use of space and their identification with the loft concept, makes up the empirical component of the research. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
