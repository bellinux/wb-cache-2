25|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive genetic blood disorder {{which leads to}} alterations {{in the shape of}} red blood cells. Not only can SCD impact the immune system, but it can lead to complications with memory. Children with SCD have shown impairments in event-based prospective memory. They may struggle with aspects of daily life that require prospective memory, such as forgetting to do homework even with a schoolbag nearby. More importantly, it is more difficult to manage the disease as they can forget about when to take medication or <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> appointment. These effects can also persist into adulthood.|$|E

Eventually I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor.</b> He examined me thoroughly, and shook his head.|$|R

An in depth discussion of lab results and the certainty that the patient can understand them may lead to the patient feeling reassured, and with that may bring positive outcomes in the physician-patient relationship.|$|E
