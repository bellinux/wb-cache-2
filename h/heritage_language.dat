25|$|Textbooks on the Nanai language, fairy tales, {{and artistic}} {{literature}} {{are used in}} Nanai language teaching. Sometimes teachers took the initiative to use oral folklore as well. However, {{there is a shortage}} of teaching and auxiliary materials, as well as difficulty in motivating students. Nanai language textbooks follow the model of Russian language textbooks aimed at native speakers, rather than emphasising instruction in the language itself, and in the theoretical/practical grammar. This model is not adequate for the situation of <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> preservation. Moreover, the existing language teaching materials are oriented predominantly (or only) towards the development of reading habits; however, the number of publications in the Nanaian language does not exceed one-two ten, mostly collections of folklore or artistic works of the historical-biographical genre, publishing in limited print runs. Instruction in spoken language is not conducted sufficiently and is not reinforced by teaching aids.|$|E

40|$|This is a Life Story {{project that}} {{examined}} {{the relationships between}} the personal and the cultural identities of American Indian persons and their abilities to speak their <b>heritage</b> <b>languages.</b> More specifically, how <b>Heritage</b> <b>Languages</b> influenced the processes of language socialization, literacy acquisition and the formation of the personal and the cultural identities of American Indian children. The premise of the study was that a child's identity, sense of belonging, literacy acquisition and success in school are interrelated aspects of her/his cultural, social, linguistic and political histories. Through the telling of life stories the underpinnings of culture, language, literacy and socialization processes were explicated as fundamental aspects which constituted holistic life experiences for children. The stories revealed how these constructs and processes were formative of their personal and cultural identities. The importance of <b>Heritage</b> <b>Languages</b> was foregrounded as a central feature in these processes. The discussions with the consultants had three sections: (a) their language and socialization contexts and practices from early childhood to adulthood, (b) their remembrances of literacy acquisition, and (c) their notions concerning the importance of and the efficacy of <b>Heritage</b> <b>Languages</b> as central to identity and to the continuance of their cultures. The findings from this project were used to discuss two interrelated concepts. First, the ways in which <b>Heritage</b> <b>Languages</b> were formative of the cultural identities of persons growing up on and around a Reservation. Second, the ways in which <b>Heritage</b> <b>Languages</b> contributed to literacy acquisition and to their social and academic success in school...|$|R

2500|$|The Qianlong Emperor {{instituted a}} policy of [...] "Manchu-fying" [...] the Eight Banner system, which was the basic {{military}} and social organisation of the dynasty. In the early Qing era, Nurhaci and Huangtaiji categorised Manchu and Han ethnic identity within the Eight Banners based on culture, lifestyle and language, instead of ancestry or genealogy. Han Bannermen were {{an important part of}} the Banner System. The Qianlong Emperor changed this definition to one of descent, and demobilised many Han Bannermen and urged Manchu Bannermen to protect their cultural <b>heritage,</b> <b>language</b> and martial skills. The emperor redefined the identity of Han Bannermen by saying that they were to be regarded as of having the same culture and being of the same ancestral extraction as Han civilians Conversely, he emphasised the martial side of Manchu culture and reinstituted the practice of the annual imperial hunt as begun by his grandfather, leading contingents from the Manchu and Mongol banners to the Mulan hunting grounds each autumn to test and improve their skills.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{different}} kinds of <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> learners, such as learners with varying levels of proficiency in the <b>heritage</b> <b>language,</b> and also those who learn a [...] "foreign" [...] language in school with which they have some connection.

In his conception of <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> learners, monolingual English-speaking students of Armenian ancestry in the United States could consider themselves to have a <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> of Armenian.

Such changes in language use will ultimately lead to the irreversible suppression of the world's language diversity. Language maintenance attempts to counter these processes. Linguists may assist ethno linguistic minorities in safeguarding their threatened languages in many different ways, including establishing orthography when necessary, but speakers decide to abandon their <b>heritage</b> <b>languages</b> within a broad socio-political and economic context. Communities uphold or give up languages, so only the speakers of endangered languages themselves can opt for and execute language maintenance activities.

50|$|As {{research}} on <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> learners' acquisition is relatively recent, {{dating back to}} the early 2000s, there remains much to be discovered about the process.

Such analyses also provide a proving ground on which to test which theoretical principles of sociolinguistics are universal. To begin to tackle the complex issue of how we might develop a framework for cross-cultural sociolinguistics, I share some insights from comparative analysis of several languages that are spoken in one city but {{that have not been}} subjected to much sociolinguistic analysis. The languages in question (Cantonese, Faetar, Korean, Italian, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian and Hungarian) are <b>heritage</b> <b>languages</b> spoken in Toronto for 50 - 100 + years and subjected to variationist scrutiny since 2009. Comparative analyses of homeland and heritage patterns across several <b>heritage</b> <b>languages</b> are compared to better understand the processes of language variation and change in this set of lesser-studied varieties. I highlight trends observed in seven years of ongoing study of Toronto’s <b>heritage</b> <b>languages</b> that may help us understand contact-induced change in this context at the community, generation, and individual level. Comparisons reveal surprising discrepancies between reports of linguistic attitudes and language use and evidence of ongoing change. The most surprising trend is the lack of correlation between usage patterns and attitudes to linguistic innovation. Such issues must be understood if we are to develop a framework for cross-cultural comparisons...|$|R

50|$|Among linguists, <b>heritage</b> <b>{{language}}</b> is an end-state {{language that}} is defined based on the temporal order of acquisition and, often, the language dominance in the individual. A heritage speaker acquires the <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> as their first language through natural input in the home environment and acquires the majority language as a second language, usually when she/he starts school and talks about different topics with people in school, or by exposure through media (written texts, internet, popular culture etc.). As exposure to the <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> decreases and exposure to the majority language increases, the majority language becomes the individual’s dominant language and acquisition of the <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> changes. The results of these changes {{can be seen in}} divergence of the <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> from monolingual norms in the areas of phonology, lexical knowledge (knowledge of vocabulary or words), morphology, syntax, semantics and code-switching, although mastery of the <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> may vary from purely receptive skills in only informal spoken language to native-like fluency.|$|E

40|$|Bi- and {{multilingualism}} {{has been}} shown to have positive effects on the attainment of third and additional lan-guages. These effects, however, depend on the type of bi- and multilingualism and the status of the languages involved (Cenoz 2003; Jessner 2006). In this explorative trend study, we revisit Cummins’ Threshold Hypothesis (1979), claiming that bilingual children must reach certain levels of attainment in order to a) avoid academic deficits and b) allow bilingualism to {{have a positive effect on}} their cognitive development and academic attain-ment. To this end, we examine the attainment of English as an academic language of 16 -year-old school children from Hamburg (n= 52). Our findings support the existence of thresholds for literacy attainment. We argue that language external factors may override positive effects of bilingualism. In addition, these factors may compensate negative effects attributable to low literacy attainment in German and the <b>heritage</b> <b>languages.</b> We also show that low attainment levels in migrant children’s <b>heritage</b> <b>languages</b> preempt high literacy attainment in additional languages...|$|R
50|$|The In{{complete}} Acquisition Theory {{recognizes that}} complete acquisition of L1 takes place throughout childhood, stretching into the school-age period. Therefore, <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> learners, who typically {{switch to the}} dominant culture’s language when they enter school and, consequently, experience a decline in input in the <b>heritage</b> <b>language,</b> do not completely acquire their first language. As <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> learners are rarely schooled in their L1, they are often orally proficient but illiterate or have underdeveloped written comprehension and production in the <b>heritage</b> <b>language.</b> In treating <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> learning as interrupted L1 acquisition, in which the learner has access to Universal Grammar, {{it is expected that}} <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> learners have knowledge of concepts found in early stages of L1 development, such as binding constraints, wh-movement, and aspects of lexical semantics, and struggle with grammatical concepts that require sustained exposure and practice in school-aged children, such as specialized vocabulary and uses of the subjunctive in Spanish.|$|E

50|$|Without {{the ability}} to {{communicate}} with parents or other family members, it becomes difficult to create an identity intertwined with one's heritage culture. In fact, once the <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> is lost, children may lose the cognitive ability to understand certain concepts of beliefs in their heritage culture. Those who lose the <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> and choose not to actively maintain its use often assimilate into the dominant culture rather quickly. When <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> learning does take place, the “standard” language is instructed, and learners whose <b>heritage</b> <b>language</b> is of a different dialect are judged for their variance from the standard.

5000|$|The {{study and}} {{teaching}} of indigenous <b>heritage</b> <b>languages</b> stands {{at odds with}} colonial governments' earlier attempts at forced cultural assimilation.  The process of language loss accelerated by colonial policies and practices means that many indigenous languages {{are faced with the}} threat of extinction, and the effort to teach them as <b>heritage</b> <b>languages</b> intersects with broader language revitalization projects. While learners of immigrant languages are likely to have at least partial knowledge of their language from an early age, indigenous language learners may never have spoken their languages before they began learning them in a formal setting. [...] Education in these languages is further complicated by social stigma, and the feelings of shame or inadequacy that some indigenous people may associate with their language due to colonial intervention.  Adult speakers coming from a legacy such as that of Canada's residential schools, whose negative psychological effects have been reported by Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, may be unable or unwilling to pass their language on to their children.|$|R
