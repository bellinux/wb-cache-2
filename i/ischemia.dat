5|$|Transient global amnesia is a dramatic, sudden, temporary, near-total loss of {{short-term}} memory. Various causes have been hypothesized including <b>ischemia,</b> epilepsy, migraine and disturbance of cerebral venous blood flow, leading to <b>ischemia</b> of {{structures such as}} the hippocampus {{that are involved in}} memory.|$|E
5|$|If the {{symptoms}} of delayed <b>ischemia</b> do not improve with medical treatment, angiography may be attempted to identify the sites of vasospasms and administer vasodilator medication (drugs that relax the blood vessel wall) directly into the artery. Angioplasty (opening the constricted area with a balloon) may also be performed.|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{of brain}} ischemia: The {{prevention}} of brain <b>ischemia</b> {{is made by}} decreasing the amount of CSF in the limited space inside the skull. This decreases total intracranial pressure and facilitates blood perfusion.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also binds to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It {{has a high}} {{affinity for}} myoglobin, about 60 times {{greater than that of}} oxygen. Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. This causes reduced cardiac output and hypotension, which may result in brain <b>ischemia.</b> A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect may be due to a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|Once {{dissection}} has occurred, two mechanisms {{contribute to}} the development of stroke symptoms. Firstly, the flow through the blood vessel may be disrupted due to the accumulation of blood under the vessel wall, leading to <b>ischemia</b> (insufficient blood supply). Secondly, irregularities in the vessel wall and turbulence increase the risk of thrombosis (the formation of blood clots) and embolism (migration) of these clots of the brain. From various lines of evidence, it appears that thrombosis and embolism is the predominant problem.|$|E
5|$|Risk factors {{indicating}} {{an increased}} risk of death include older age, female gender, a history of liver cirrhosis, biliary narrowing due to cancer, acute renal failure and the presence of liver abscesses. Complications following severe cholangitis include renal failure, respiratory failure (inability of the respiratory system to oxygenate blood and/or eliminate carbon dioxide), cardiac arrhythmia, wound infection, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding and myocardial <b>ischemia</b> (lack of blood flow to the heart, leading to heart attacks).|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} a fast tissue {{and might be}} in {{supersaturated}} state in the early phase of decompression. It acts as a gas reservoir and feeds any local bubble which will grow. The bubble may just proceed through the capillaries to the venous side for another cycle, but may be trapped and will then grow in place, causing local restriction of the blood supply and finally <b>ischemia.</b> This may develop into central neurological symptoms.|$|E
5|$|There is also modest {{evidence}} that genetic factors influence the prognosis in SAH. For example, having {{two copies of}} ApoE4 (a variant of the gene encoding apolipoprotein E that also {{plays a role in}} Alzheimer's disease) seems to increase risk for delayed <b>ischemia</b> and a worse outcome. The occurrence of hyperglycemia (high blood sugars) after an episode of SAH confers a higher risk of poor outcome.|$|E
25|$|Ischemia-Modified Albumin (IMA) – In {{cases of}} <b>Ischemia</b> – Albumin {{undergoes}} a conformational change and loses {{its ability to}} bind transitional metals (copper or cobalt). IMA {{can be used to}} assess the proportion of modified albumin in <b>ischemia.</b> Its use is limited to ruling out <b>ischemia</b> rather than a diagnostic test for the occurrence of <b>ischemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Thrombosis of the {{superior}} mesenteric vein can cause mesenteric <b>ischemia</b> also known as ischemic bowel. Mesenteric <b>ischemia</b> can also result from {{the formation of a}} volvulus, a twisted loop of the small intestine that when it wraps around itself and also encloses the mesentery too tightly can cause <b>ischemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{patients}} with ischemic colitis recover fully, although the prognosis {{depends on the}} severity of the <b>ischemia.</b> Patients with pre-existing peripheral vascular disease or <b>ischemia</b> of the ascending (right) colon may be at increased risk for complications or death.|$|E
25|$|The {{exogenous}} {{regulation of}} calpain activity is therefore {{of interest for}} the development of therapeutics in a wide array of pathological states. As a few of the many examples supporting the therapeutic potential of calpain inhibition in <b>ischemia,</b> calpain inhibitor AK275 protected against focal ischemic brain damage in rats when administered after <b>ischemia,</b> and MDL28170 significantly reduced the size of damaged infarct tissue in a rat focal <b>ischemia</b> model. There are also known calpain inhibitors with neuroprotective effects: PD150606, SJA6017, ABT-705253, and SNJ-1945.|$|E
25|$|Placental {{abnormalities}} such as placental <b>ischemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ischemic colitis {{is often}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} underlying cause. Non-occlusive <b>ischemia</b> develops because of low blood pressure or constriction of the vessels feeding the colon; occlusive <b>ischemia</b> indicates that a blood clot or other blockage has cut off {{blood flow to the}} colon.|$|E
25|$|Arterial {{thrombosis}} {{may require}} surgery if it causes acute limb <b>ischemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{arterial}} thrombus or embolus {{can also}} {{form in the}} limbs, {{which can lead to}} acute limb <b>ischemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Avoiding smoking. It {{reduces the}} blood supply, leading to tissue <b>ischemia,</b> reduced tissue {{perfusion}} and eventually {{higher incidence of}} painful socket.|$|E
25|$|Glycogen Phosphorylase Isoenzyme BB-(GPBB) is {{an early}} marker of cardiac <b>ischemia</b> {{and is one of}} three {{isoenzyme}} of Glycogen Phosphorylase.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{with mild}} to {{moderate}} ischemic colitis are usually treated with IV fluids, analgesia, and bowel rest (that is, no food or water by mouth) until the symptoms resolve. Those with severe <b>ischemia</b> who develop complications such as sepsis, intestinal gangrene, or bowel perforation may require more aggressive interventions such as surgery and intensive care. Most patients make a full recovery; occasionally, after severe <b>ischemia,</b> patients may develop long-term complications such as a stricture or chronic colitis.|$|E
25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for pancreatitis includes {{but is not}} limited to cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, perforated peptic ulcer, bowel infarction, small bowel obstruction, hepatitis and mesenteric <b>ischemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are devices which {{test the}} {{sufficiency}} of oxygen delivery to the colon. The first device {{approved by the}} U.S. FDA in 2004 uses visible light spectroscopy to analyze capillary oxygen levels. Use during Aortic Aneurysm repair detected when colon oxygen levels fell below sustainable levels, allowing real-time repair. In several studies, Specificity has been 90% or higher for acute colonic <b>ischemia,</b> and 83% for chronic mesenteric <b>ischemia,</b> with a sensitivity of 71%-92%. This device must be placed using endoscopy, however.|$|E
25|$|Underlying <b>ischemia</b> {{may also}} be treated surgically by {{arterial}} revascularization, for example in diabetic ulcers, and patients with venous ulcers may undergo surgery to correct vein dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|An embolus lodging in {{the brain}} from either the heart or a carotid artery {{will most likely be}} the cause of a stroke due to <b>ischemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Ischemia</b> or non-ST {{elevation}} myocardial infarctions may manifest as ST {{depression or}} inversion of T waves. It may also affect the high frequency {{band of the}} QRS.|$|E
25|$|Compression of the {{ipsilateral}} posterior {{cerebral artery}} will result in <b>ischemia</b> of the ipsilateral primary visual cortex and contralateral visual field deficits in both eyes (contralateral homonymous hemianopsia).|$|E
25|$|The {{prognosis}} for non-ischemic cases of SBO is good with mortality rates of 3–5%, while {{prognosis for}} SBO with <b>ischemia</b> is fair with mortality rates {{as high as}} 30%.|$|E
25|$|The rectum {{receives}} {{blood from}} both the inferior mesenteric artery and the internal iliac artery; the rectum is rarely involved by colonic <b>ischemia</b> due to this dual blood supply.|$|E
25|$|Stimulating the {{synthesis}} of SAMe, which aids in membrane stabilization and reduces levels of arachidonic acid. This is especially important after an <b>ischemia,</b> when arachidonic acid levels are elevated.|$|E
25|$|Location of a {{transplant}} center {{with respect to}} a donor hospital is given priority due to the effects of Cold Ischemic Time (CIT). Once the organ is removed from the donor, blood no longer perfuses through the vessels and begins to starve the cells of oxygen (<b>ischemia).</b> Each organ tolerates different ischemic times. Hearts and lungs need to be transplanted within 4–6 hours from recovery, liver about 8–10 hours and pancreas about 15 hours; kidneys are the most resilient to <b>ischemia.</b> Kidneys packaged on ice can be successfully transplanted 24–36 hours after recovery. Developments in kidney preservation have yielded a device that pumps cold preservation solution through the kidneys vessels to prevent Delayed Graft Function (DGF) due to <b>ischemia.</b> Perfusion devices, often called kidney pumps, can extend graft survival to 36–48 hours post recovery for kidneys. Recently similar devices have been developed for the heart and lungs, in an effort to increase distances procurement teams may travel to recover an organ.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostaglandin}} iloprost is used {{to manage}} critical <b>ischemia</b> and pulmonary hypertension in RP, and the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan {{is used to}} manage severe pulmonary hypertension and prevent finger ulcers in scleroderma.|$|E
25|$|Myocardial <b>ischemia</b> {{also can}} {{be the result of}} factors {{affecting}} blood composition, such as reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, as seen with severe anemia (low number of red blood cells), or long-term smoking.|$|E
25|$|Patients do not {{experience}} other neurological deficits such as numbness or weakness, and if these symptoms are present, {{a more serious}} etiology, such as posterior circulation stroke or <b>ischemia,</b> must be considered.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{septic shock}} {{are treated with}} {{antimicrobial}} drugs to treat the causative infection. Some sources of infection require surgical intervention including necrotizing fasciitis, cholangitis, abscess, intestinal <b>ischemia,</b> or infected medical devices.|$|E
25|$|Most {{victims of}} cold-water {{drowning}} do not develop hypothermia {{quickly enough to}} decrease cerebral metabolism before <b>ischemia</b> and irreversible hypoxia occur. The neuroprotective effects appear to require water temperatures below about 5°C.|$|E
25|$|Excitotoxicity is {{phenomenon}} in which glutamate receptors are inappropriately activated. It {{can be caused}} by prolonged excitatory synaptic transmission in which high levels of glutamate neurotransmitter cause excessive activation in a postsynaptic neuron that can result in the death of the postsynaptic neuron. Following brain injury (such as from <b>ischemia),</b> it has been found that excitotoxicity is a significant cause of neuronal damage. This can be understandable in the case where sudden perfusion of blood after reduced blood flow to the brain can result in excessive synaptic activity caused by the presence of increased glutamate and aspartate during the period of <b>ischemia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cardiac MRI is {{complementary}} {{to other}} imaging techniques, such as echocardiography, cardiac CT, and nuclear medicine. Its applications include assessment of myocardial <b>ischemia</b> and viability, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, iron overload, vascular diseases, and congenital heart disease.|$|E
