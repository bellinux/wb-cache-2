5|$|The web series {{begins as}} Jake Fischer arrives in Bright Falls to {{interview}} Dr. Hartman {{on his new}} book, an assignment from his publication agency. After a series of encounters with local townspeople, Jake soon finds himself the victim of long periods of lost time and black outs.

When he realises this, he tries to duct-tape himself to a refrigerator and recording videotape himself in his sleep to see what might be causing the behaviour.

On a mountain he finds {{the only place in}} his entire journey where moths are abundant; he collected 1,386 moths on a total of 26 nights, but over 800 of these were caught on four very wet and dark nights. He attributes the reason to having a ceiling that effectively trapped the moths; in other houses the moths at once escaped into the roof, and he recommends naturalists to bring a verandah-shaped tent to enable them to catch moths.|$|E

Finding out Archduke Ferdinand has been assassinated, Hannay reaches Scotland and leaves the train to escape the police. <b>He</b> <b>stays</b> <b>in</b> a barn overnight, where he deciphers the code in the notebook (except a section in double code), which reveals the Germans want to destroy the Royal Navy so that they could invade the country, starting a war.

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was {{critical}} of Emma in the show's second season. He said: [...] "Emma is apparently married, but we haven’t seen her husband since October, and {{even when he was}} more of a “fixture” on the show (which is difficult to say about a character who’s appeared as little as Carl Howell has), his relationship with Emma made no sense as anything other than a plot device. Now, as it turns out, Emma and Carl haven’t consummated their marriage at all, and this {{has something to do with}} the fact that the show has combined Emma’s germ-phobia and virginity into some sort of terrifying psychosexual pathology that doesn’t make much sense and doesn’t resemble the somewhat levelheaded person she used to be. (The plotting in Will Schuester’s love life is the one place where the show attempts to have even a modicum of continuity, for whatever reason.) Anyway, Carl is necessarily upset about this, and he’s also upset when Holly Holliday gets Emma to admit that she still has confusing feelings for Will, so he resolves to let her stay in the condo while <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> <b>in</b> the Radisson where all of the good big-name Glee guest stars go to hope their pilots for the fall are picked up." ...|$|E

500|$|David Denby {{described}} Smith's {{performance as}} contrasting with his performances {{in his other}} films. He said, [...] "For {{the first time in}} his life, Will Smith doesn’t flirt with the audience... <b>he</b> <b>stays</b> <b>in</b> character as a self-hating lonely guy." [...] Stephen Hunter argued that Smith and his co-stars had misunderstood the material in the same manner as Berg. He added that the examination of Smith's character came across at first as an examination of [...] "phenomenally gifted" [...] black sporting superstars who were [...] "marginalized", [...] "dehumanized" [...] and exploited as a product by society. Manohla Dargis was struck by Theron's performance, saying that she enabled Smith to deepen the film's emotional complexity. Todd McCarthy said that Smith's [...] "attitude-laden quips" [...] helped to carry the film's superior first half, and that all three leads performed capably, but he said no opportunity was offered for the supporting characters to register. Roger Ebert writing in the Chicago Sun Times praised the three leads, saying that Smith avoided playing Hancock [...] "as a goofball" [...] and instead portrayed him as a more subtle and serious character. Stephen Farber said that Hancock was a good showcase for the leads, affirming that Smith shone in a film that was only sporadically worthy of his performance, while Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent said that despite the mix of themes [...] "the laughs are frequent and genuine (no forced slapstick), the fight scenes exciting and the emotional stuff quite moving [...] ".|$|E
