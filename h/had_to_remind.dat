25|$|As {{electrification}} progressed, the old {{rolling stock}} was advertised for sale. An attempt {{to sell the}} 18 locomotives and 96 carriages by auction in June 1903 proved completely unsuccessful – the auctioneer <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> the bidders {{that he was not}} selling scrap. It was September before the first locomotive was sold; it would take another two years to sell all-bar-one of the locomotives. The last locomotive — which had been retained for working permanent way trains — was sold in January 1908.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} Colombian {{government}} was mostly in {{doubt about the}} presence of enemy agents operating in their country, the United States through Lend-Lease was providing the former with economic assistance to counter enemy agent activity, and constantly <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> the Colombian government that the aid would be cut off if it did not acknowledge the threat. The benefits of American economic assistance, and threats to cut it off, were irresistible, however, and as result, Colombia monitored, interned, or deported hundreds of people from Germany, Japan, and Italy, during the war.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{operation}} was completed, the prognosis had been gloomy, with Churchill warning the House of Commons on 28 May to expect [...] "hard and heavy tidings". Subsequently, Churchill referred to the outcome as a [...] "miracle", and the British press presented the evacuation as a [...] "disaster turned to triumph" [...] so successfully, that Churchill <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> the country, {{in a speech to}} the House of Commons on 4 June, that [...] "we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory.

500|$|It is {{possible}} that the marriage with Elisiv had been agreed to already during Harald's first time in Rus', or that they at least had been acquainted. During his service in the Byzantine Empire, Harald composed a love poem which included the verse [...] "Yet the goddess in Russia/ will not accept my gold rings" [...] (whom Snorri Sturluson identifies with Elisiv), although Morkinskinna claims that Harald <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> Yaroslav of the promised marriage when he returned to Kiev. According to the same source, Harald had spoken with Yaroslav during his first time in Rus', requesting to marry Elisiv, only to be rejected because he was not yet wealthy enough. It is in any case significant that Harald was allowed to marry the daughter of Yaroslav, since his other children were married to figures such as Henry I of France, Andrew I of Hungary and the daughter of Constantine IX.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Glamour in 2008, Goldstein said that while he had been sober for nine years, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> himself every day {{that he was still}} a drug addict, saying: [...] "At any given moment, I'm five seconds away from walking up to someone, grabbing their drink out of their hand and downing it. And if I do that, within a week, tops, I'll be smoking crack." [...] Following the plane crash, Goldstein was prescribed painkillers and anti-anxiety medication. Celebrity doctor Drew Pinsky said it was those prescriptions which opened the [...] "floodgates" [...] to Goldstein's relapse. A friend of his reached the same conclusion, saying: [...] "I think the plane crash killed him, it just took a year for it to do it." [...] As a result of the plane crash, Goldstein developed a fear of flying, and continued consuming anxiety medication to help deal with the regular flights his lifestyle required.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{was a man}} of high {{ideals and}} was popular with his fellow players. Pelham Warner commented on his {{pleasant}} nature and Robert Trumble, an author and son of Hugh Trumble, recalled him as honest, direct and without guile. [...] An anecdote told about Hill had him hitting a low shot into shadows where Warren Bardsley was fielding. He completed one run and then asked the umpire if the ball had been caught. [...] The shadow made it impossible for the umpire to see, so Hill then asked Bardsley, [...] "Did you catch it?" [...] When Bardsley replied in the affirmative, Hill immediately walked to the pavilion. When England won four Tests in a row in 1911–12, Hill managed to retain the confidence of his players. [...] Frank Iredale wrote that Hill was a cheery skipper whose men were happy under his leadership. Despite breaking many records, Hill showed little awareness of them. [...] When watching Jack Hobbs break his record for the most runs in Test cricket at Headingley in 1926, it was Hobbs' wife sitting nearby who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> Hill that the record was previously his.|$|E

500|$|In August 2011, {{it first}} was {{revealed}} that Lady Gaga would make a guest appearance on the show as herself. Producer James L. Brooks viewed Gaga's interview with Anderson Cooper on 60 Minutes, which prompted Al Jean to write a script and send her a letter of approval {{to appear on the}} show. [...] "She was really excited about the whole thing," [...] Jean recalled. [...] "After she signed on to do it, she came in to record dialogue twice, and we showed her a rough cut the second time." [...] Recording sessions for the episode took place in Los Angeles during a period of four days from August 22–26. Gaga was initially apprehensive while recording on set, which led her to review the satirical nature of the show to get a better understanding on how to perform. [...] "Their characters are so awesomely convincing and sincere and wild and funny, I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> myself constantly of the sincerity of the humor," [...] she explained. [...] "That's what I was trying to focus on—not putting on a character too much, and really being as sincere as I could with the lines." [...] Despite such emotions, Gaga professed that working with the staff of the show was [...] "one of the coolest things that [...] has ever done".|$|E
500|$|In 2010, he co-starred with Michelle Williams in Derek Cianfrance's directorial debut, {{the marital}} drama Blue Valentine. The low-budget film was mainly improvised and Gosling has said [...] "you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> {{yourself}} {{you were making}} a film". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt he [...] "brings a preternatural understanding of people to his performance" [...] while A.O. Scott of The New York Times found him [...] "convincing as the run-down, desperate, older Dean, and maybe a bit less so as the younger version". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly noted that he [...] "plays Dean as a snarky working-class hipster, but when his anger is unleashed, the performance turns powerful." [...] However, Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe felt the performance {{was an example of}} [...] "hipsterism misdirected". He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. The film was a box office success, grossing over $12 million worldwide from a production budget of $1 million. Gosling's second on-screen appearance of 2010 was in the mystery film All Good Things with Kirsten Dunst, based on a true story. He played the role of New York real-estate heir Robert Durst, who was investigated for the disappearance of his wife (played by Dunst). Gosling found the filming process to be a [...] "dark experience" [...] and did not undertake any promotional duties for the film. When asked if he was proud of the film, he replied, [...] "I'm proud of what Kirsten does in the movie." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone felt he [...] "gets so deep into character you can feel his nerve endings." [...] Mick La Salle of the San Francisco Chronicle found the [...] "chameleonic Gosling is completely convincing as this empty shell of a man". Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt that the film belonged to Dunst, but noted that Gosling [...] "is good too". The film grossed $644,535 worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Charbonnier {{had been}} {{appointed}} army commander on 5 February 1794.

The group planned to start the offensive on 10 May with Desjardin's corps crossing the Sambre to the west of Thuin. Leaving 5,000 troops to guard the Philippeville to Beaumont road, Charbonnier's army was to march via Thuillies and cross the Sambre to the east of Thuin. Once across the river, the Army of the North divisions would move through Mont-Sainte-Geneviève toward Mons. Meanwhile, the Army of Ardennes would march via Leval (Leval-Trahegnies) while posting a flank guard to the east at Fontaine-l'Évêque. Nevertheless, Charbonnier was hesitant about carrying out the plan and Desjardin <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> his colleague that Pichegru's orders did not leave them any room to back out.|$|E
