By modeling with VHDL and using design synthesis techniques, different architectures of floating point adders, multipliers and multiply-accumulate <b>fused</b> <b>units,</b> are compared using different technologies and cell libraries. Some modifications to recent published works have been proposed to minimize the energy delay product with special emphasis on power reduction. A new low power, high performance, transition activity scaled, double data path floating point multiplier has been proposed and its validity is proved by comparing it to a single data path floating point multiplier. A transition activity scaled, triple data path floating point adder has been compared with a high speed, single data path floating point adder using an optimized Leading Zero Anticipatory logic. Three different architectures of floating point multiply-accumulate <b>fused</b> <b>units</b> are evaluated for their desirability for high speed, low power and minimum area.

40|$|Loops are {{the main}} {{time-consuming}} part of numerical applications. The performance of the loops is limited either by the resources offered by the architecture or by recurrences in the computation. To execute more operations per cycle, current processors are designed with growing degrees of resource replication (replication technique) for memory ports and functional units. However, the high cost in terms of area and cycle time of this technique precludes the use of high degrees of replication. High values for the cycle time may clearly offset any gain in terms of number of execution cycles. High values for the area may lead to an unimplementable configuration. An alternative to resource replication is resource widening (widening technique), which has also been used in some recent designs in which {{the width of the}} resources is increased (i. e., a single operation is performed over multiple data). Moreover, several general-purpose superscalar microprocessors have been implemented with multiply-add <b>fused</b> floating-point <b>units</b> (fusion technique), which reduces the latency of the combined operation and the number of resources used. The authors evaluate a broad set of VLIW processor design alternatives that combine the three techniques. We perform a technological projection for the next processor generations in order to foresee the possible implementable alternatives. From this study, we conclude that if the cost is taken into account, combining certain degrees of replication and widening in the hardware resources is more effective than applying only replication. Also, we confirm that multiply-add <b>fused</b> <b>units</b> will have a significant impact in raising the performance of future processor architectures with a reasonable increase in costPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
