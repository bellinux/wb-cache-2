5|$|Divers {{operate in}} an {{environment}} for which {{the human body is}} not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The <b>hazards</b> include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also <b>hazards</b> of the specific diving environment, and <b>hazards</b> related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. <b>Hazards</b> inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional <b>hazards</b> of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{procedure}} is given {{for evaluating the}} toxic threat of selenium to fish and wildlife. Toxic threat is expressed as <b>hazard,</b> {{and is based on}} the potential for food-chain bioaccumulation and reproductive impairment in fish and aquatic birds, which are the most sensitive biological responses for estimating ecosystem-level impacts of selenium contamination. Five degrees of <b>hazard</b> are possible depending on the expected environmental concentrations of selenium, exposure of fish and aquatic birds to toxic concentrations, and resultant potential for reproductive impairment. The degree of <b>hazard</b> is given a numerical score: 5 = high <b>hazard,</b> 4 = moderate <b>hazard,</b> 3 = low <b>hazard,</b> 2 = minimal <b>hazard,</b> and 1 = no identifiable <b>hazard.</b> A separate <b>hazard</b> score is given to each of five ecosystem components; water, sediments, benthic macroinvertebrates, fish eggs, and aquatic bird eggs. A final <b>hazard</b> characterization is determined by adding individual scores and comparing the total to the following evaluation criteria: 5 = no <b>hazard,</b> 6 - 8 = minimal <b>hazard,</b> 9 - 11 = low <b>hazard,</b> 12 - 15 = moderate <b>hazard,</b> 16 - 25 = high <b>hazard.</b> An example is given to illustrate how the {{procedure is}} applied to selenium data from a typical contaminant monitoring program...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} assess <b>hazard</b> of ground water resource degradation using the Geographical Information System (GIS). The entire land of Southern Iran faces problems arising out of land degradation. The Mond Miyani sub basin, located centrally to this zone, which covers the middle part of Mond River, has been chosen for a test assessment of the <b>hazard</b> of ground water resource degradation which forms {{one of the major}} types of land degradation. The data analyzed have been gathered from the records, reports and maps published by the governmental offices of Iran. The GIS analysis considers various <b>hazard</b> indicators distinguishing areas with different severity of <b>hazard</b> classification. The <b>hazard</b> indicator maps take into account the hydrogeological and climatological characteristics and those anthropogenic activities related to irrigation farming. The final <b>hazard</b> classes were defined on the basis of <b>hazard</b> scores arrived at by assigning the appropriate attributes to the indicators and the final <b>hazard</b> map was prepared by overlaying different <b>hazard</b> indicator maps in the GIS, deploying the new model. The final <b>Hazard</b> Map shows that moderate <b>hazard</b> areas (70. 8 % of the plains) are much widespread than areas under severe <b>hazard</b> (13. 4 % of the plains).

40|$|Biomass {{gasification}} {{stations are}} facing many <b>hazard</b> factors, therefore, {{it is necessary}} to make <b>hazard</b> assessment for them. In this study, a novel <b>hazard</b> assessment method called extended set pair analysis (ESPA) is proposed based on set pair analysis (SPA). However, the calculation of the connection degree (CD) requires the classification of <b>hazard</b> grades and their corresponding thresholds using SPA for the <b>hazard</b> assessment. In regard to the <b>hazard</b> assessment using ESPA, a novel calculation algorithm of the CD is worked out when <b>hazard</b> grades and their corresponding thresholds are unknown. Then the CD can be converted into Euclidean distance (ED) by a simple and concise calculation, and the <b>hazard</b> of each sample will be ranked based on the value of ED. In this paper, six biomass gasification stations are introduced to make <b>hazard</b> assessment using ESPA and general set pair analysis (GSPA), respectively. By the comparison of <b>hazard</b> assessment results obtained from ESPA and GSPA, the availability and validity of ESPA can be proved in the <b>hazard</b> assessment for biomass gasification stations. Meanwhile, the reasonability of ESPA is also justified by the sensitivity analysis of <b>hazard</b> assessment results obtained by ESPA and GSPA...|$|R
