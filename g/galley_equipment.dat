50|$|Once {{up in the}} air, {{flight attendants}} will usually serve drinks and/or food to passengers. When not {{performing}} customer service duties, flight attendants must periodically conduct cabin checks and listen for any unusual noises or situations. Checks must also {{be done on the}} lavatory to ensure the smoke detector hasn't been disabled or destroyed and to restock supplies as needed. Regular cockpit checks must be done to ensure {{the health and safety of}} the pilot(s). They must also respond to call lights dealing with special requests. During turbulence, flight attendants must ensure the cabin is secure. Prior to landing, all loose items, trays and rubbish must be collected and secured along with service and <b>galley</b> <b>equipment.</b> All hot liquids must be disposed of. A final cabin check must then be completed prior to landing. It is vital that flight attendants remain aware as the majority of emergencies occur during takeoff and landing. Upon landing, flight attendants must remain stationed at exits and monitor the airplane and cabin as passengers disembark the plane. They also assist any special needs passengers and small children off the airplane and escort children, while following the proper paperwork and ID process to escort them to the designated person picking them up.|$|E

50|$|The Cape Lookout Coast Guard Station {{is located}} on the Core Banks of North Carolina between Cape Lookout and the Cape Lookout Light. The station was built as a {{lifeboat}} station beginning in 1916 and comprises a complex of several frame buildings. The chief structure is the Main Station, a neo-colonial building with a central cupola or watchtower. It is surrounded by a <b>galley,</b> or messhall, <b>equipment</b> buildings, cisterns and similar support structures. Two similar stations were built at Hatteras Inlet and Cape Fear, which have not survived. The Cape Lookout station was chiefly responsible for providing rescue services in the Cape Lookout Shoals, which extend ten miles into the Atlantic Ocean and represent a significant hazard to coastwise shipping. The Cape Lookout station operated until 1982, and is now under the care of Cape Lookout National Seashore.|$|R
40|$|It is {{importance}} that business organisations focus on providing the best service to their customers. The {{survival of the}} organisation depends ultimately on the service provided. This study explores the elements which affect the provision of service excellence to passengers by flight attendants at South African Airways. The study is adequately supported by a proper and detailed literature study which, in turn is founded on an empirical study on the relevant topic. A field study {{was conducted on the}} various stakeholders of the supply chain pertaining to in-flight catering to determine what specific viewpoints, suggestions and limitations there were, with regard to existing packaging, catering utensils and <b>galley</b> <b>equipment</b> used by flight attendants personal service on board the aircraft. Alternatives were considered that could result in the improvement of service provided by flight attendants. The literature review within the scope and limitations of the study therefore concentrated on the specific nature and impact that packaging, catering utensils and <b>galley</b> <b>equipment</b> have on the quality service which flight attendants provide to passengers. The study included a detailed investigation into this part of the supply chain. The reality is that flight attendants are the front-line employees not only for the airline they are employed at, but also for all the stakeholders involved in the supply chain of in-flight catering. By not supporting them and providing them with the right tools to execute their duties affects more than one stakeholder in the supply chain. The empirical part of the study was conducted by interviewing flight attendants employed at South African Airways. The objective was to determine the impact that current packaging, catering utensils and equipment had on the execution of service by the flight attendants. A further survey was conducted to determine passenger perception towards packaging, catering utensils and <b>galley</b> <b>equipment.</b> The research findings clearly indicate the problems passengers and flight attendants are experiencing. The findings indicate the impact of passengers and flight attendants and makes suggests (makes recommendations) improvements to reach the objectives of improved service delivery.

40|$|Marine Food {{group is}} active within the marine foodservice {{industry}} and is established in Finland, Sweden, USA and Singapore. The group both sells <b>galley</b> <b>equipment</b> and spare parts {{as well as}} carrying out installation of the marine foodservice areas in both new build vessels and in vessels where an old galley is changed into a new one. The group also provides its customers with turnkey deliveries, which are when the supplier has the overall responsibility for the delivery of a marine foodservice area. Marine Food group transfers goods and services between the enterprises situated in Finland, Sweden and the US and has not established a transfer pricing system for these transactions. The company located in Singapore was recently established and any intra-group transactions have not been conducted yet. This master’s thesis aims at developing a transfer pricing system that could be applicable on these transactions and acceptable to the tax authorities in Finland, Sweden and the US. The elements that should be included when developing a transfer pricing system is functional analysis, economic analysis, an analysis of transactions, selection of transfer pricing method and comparables. The Marine Food group is therefore analyzed based on these elements {{in order to be}} successful in developing a transfer pricing system. Furthermore, the transfer pricing rules in Finland, Sweden and USA is examined in order to develop a transfer pricing system that is acceptable to the tax authority in respective country. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which are another significant source that are examined when establishing a transfer pricing system for Marine Food group. Spare parts are transferred between the Swedish company, Marine Food AB and the US based company, Marine Food LLC. The transfer pricing method that should be applied in Sweden is the resale price method since Marine Food LLC operates like a reseller for the spare parts. Internal comparables exist and comparability for the purposes of resale price method can be established with reference to both internal and external data. In the US, the comparable profit method should be applied given that it meets the best method rule. The transactions from the Finnish Company, Marine Food Oy and the Swedish company, Marine Food AB consist of installation works and stainless steel furniture. Hence, the transactions both involve goods and services and should be looked at separately. The transfer price for the installation works should be set by using the transactional net margin method. In order to determine the transfer price under the transactional net margin method both internal and external comparables can be used in this case. The transfer price for the stainless steel furniture should on the other hand be established using the resale price method. In order to determine comparability external comparables are used due to lack of internal data. Marine Food AB sells <b>galley</b> <b>equipment</b> and spare parts to Marine Food Oy. The transfer pricing method that should be applied on these transactions is the resale price method since the least complex party in the transaction, Marine Food Oy, act like a reseller of the <b>galley</b> <b>equipment</b> and spare parts. Comparability is to be established with reference to external comparables since internal comparables do not exist...|$|E
40|$|The FAA {{restraint}} system experiments consisted of 24 standard and modified seats, 2 standard galleys and 2 standard overhead compartments. Under the controlled impact demonstration (CID) program, the experimental {{objective was to}} demonstrate the effectiveness of individual {{restraint system}} designs when exposed to a survivable air-to-ground impact condition. What researchers were looking for was the performance exhibited by standard and modified designs, performance differences resulting from their installed cabin location, and interrelating performance demonstrated by test article and attaching floor and/or fuselage structure. The other restraint system experiment consisted of 2 standard overhead stowage compartments and 2 galley modules. Again, researchers were concerned with the retention of stowed equipment and carry-on articles. The overhead compartments were loaded with test weights up to their maximum capacity, {{and each of the}} galleys was filled with test articles: aft with normal <b>galley</b> <b>equipment,</b> forward with hazardous material test packages. A breakdown of instrumentation and distribution is given beginning with 11 instrumented type anthropomorphic dummies and 185 sensors which provided for acceleration and load measurements at the various experiment and associated structure locations.

50|$|On 30 April 2015, USAF RC-135V, 64-14848, {{operating}} out of Offutt AFB, NE aborted takeoff on a routine training mission when crewmembers observed smoke and flames coming from the aft galley. The aircraft commander aborted the takeoff at about 50 KIAS and the cockpit crew, electronic warfare officers, intelligence operators and in-flight maintenance technicians—27 individuals in all—evacuated the aircraft. Although there were no injuries, except for minor smoke inhalation, the ensuing fire damaged aircraft control and mission related systems. Total repair cost was estimated at $62.4 million US. The cause of the mishap was failure by L3 Communications depot maintenance personnel to tighten a retaining nut connecting a metal oxygen tube to a junction fitting above the galley. This resulted in an oxygen leak and caused a highly flammable oxygen-rich environment that ignited. The resulting fire melted the retaining nut and caused the tubing to become detached, which fed even more to the fire, increased its size and caused severe damage to the airframe, <b>galley</b> and mission <b>equipment</b> aboard the aircraft. The oxygen system work which was listed {{as the cause of}} this 2015 mishap was completed in August 2013.|$|R

40|$|Future long {{duration}} manned space flights beyond low {{earth orbit}} will require the food system to remain safe, acceptable, and nutritious while efficiently balancing appropriate vehicle resources such as mass, volume, power, water, and crewtime. Often, this presents a challenge since maintaining {{the quality of the}} food system can result in a higher mass and volume. The Orion vehicle is significantly smaller than the Shuttle vehicle and the International Space Station and the mass and volume available for food is limited. Therefore, the food team has been challenged to reduce the mass of the packaged food from 1. 82 kg per person per day to 1. 14 kg per person per day. Past work has concentrated on how to reduce the mass of the packaging which contributes to about 15 % of the total mass of the packaged food system. Designers have also focused on integrating and optimizing the Orion <b>galley</b> <b>equipment</b> as a system to reduce mass. To date, {{there has not been a}} significant effort to determine how to reduce the food itself. The objective of this project is to determine how the mass and volume of the packaged food can be reduced while maintaining caloric and hydration requirements. The following tasks are the key elements to this project: (1) Conduct further analysis of the ISS Standard Menu to determine moisture, protein, carbohydrate, and fat levels. (2) Conduct trade studies to determine how to bring the mass of the food system down. Trade studies may include removing the water of the total food system and/or increasing the fat content. (3) Determine the preferred method for delivery of the new food (e. g. bars, or beverages) and the degree of replacement. (4) Determine whether there are commercially available products that meet the requirements. By the end of this study, an estimate of the mass and volume savings will be provided to the Constellation Program. In addition, if new technologies need to be developed to achieve the mass savings, the technologies, timeline, and budget will be identified at the end of the project...|$|E
