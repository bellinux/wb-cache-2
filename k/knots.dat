5|$|The {{investigators}} also {{requested that}} Fokker conduct {{a study of}} the effects of ice contamination and pilot technique on the F28 aircraft. The NTSB evaluated the data from the tests and found that the pilot initiated the rotation five <b>knots</b> earlier at 119 <b>knots</b> instead of the proper rotation speed of 124 <b>knots.</b> The data from Fokker was correlated with the cockpit voice recording and confirmed that the first officer called a rotation speed of 113 <b>knots</b> but the captain did not rotate until 119 <b>knots.</b> It was never established why the rotation was called and initiated earlier than was standard.|$|E
5|$|Confederate Army {{officers}} {{indicated their}} military affiliation with different colored facing on their coats or jackets. The colors were red for artillery, yellow for cavalry, light blue for infantry, and black for medical. A very distinctive {{feature of the}} Confederate officers uniforms was the gold braid Austrian <b>knots</b> on their sleeves. More elaborate braiding indicated higher rank and some <b>knots</b> almost reached the shoulder. However, a general order, issued in 1862, called for the Austrian <b>knots</b> not to be worn in the field, as this made officers conspicuous to enemy combatants.|$|E
5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double helical gears. An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 <b>knots</b> was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 <b>knots</b> at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 <b>knots</b> respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E

50|$|In <b>knot</b> theory, a figure-eight <b>knot</b> (also called Listing's <b>knot)</b> is {{the unique}} <b>knot</b> with a {{crossing}} number of four. This {{makes it the}} <b>knot</b> with the third-smallest possible crossing number, after the unknot and the trefoil <b>knot.</b> The figure-eight <b>knot</b> is a prime <b>knot.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of <b>knot</b> theory, a chiral <b>knot</b> is a <b>knot</b> {{that is not}} equivalent to its mirror image. An oriented <b>knot</b> that is equivalent to its mirror image is an amphichiral <b>knot,</b> also called an achiral <b>knot</b> or amphicheiral <b>knot.</b> The chirality of a <b>knot</b> is a <b>knot</b> invariant. A <b>knot's</b> chirality can be further classified depending {{on whether or not}} it is invertible.|$|R
5|$|On the 9 October 1906 she {{undertook}} her eight hour long {{full power}} contractor trials off Polperro on the Cornwell Coast {{during which she}} averaged 20.05 <b>knots</b> and 21.6 <b>knots</b> on the measured mile. She returned to Portsmouth for gun and torpedo trials before she completed her final fitting out.|$|E
5|$|Station model plots use {{a mixture}} of metric and Imperial units {{depending}} on the map's location and what is being shown. Surface maps in the United States primarily use Imperial units, such as inches, degrees Fahrenheit, and <b>knots.</b> Most of the world, however, uses metric measurements for everything but wind speed, which is shown in <b>knots.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of the {{new breed}} of ships was not their only crucial advantage. Dreadnought used steam turbines for propulsion, giving her a top speed of 21 <b>knots,</b> against the 18 <b>knots</b> typical of the pre-dreadnought battleships. Able both to outgun and outmaneuver their opponents, the dreadnought battleships decisively outclassed earlier battleship designs.|$|E
5000|$|The diamond <b>knot</b> (or knife lanyard <b>knot)</b> is a <b>knot</b> for {{forming a}} {{decorative}} loop {{on the end}} of a cord such as on a lanyard. [...] A similar <b>knot,</b> also called the diamond <b>knot,</b> is a multistrand stopper <b>knot,</b> that is similar in appearance (although the footrope <b>knot</b> is really more similar, but it is simply an upside down diamond <b>knot).</b> To avoid confusion, it is advisable to call this <b>knot</b> the knife lanyard <b>knot.</b> This <b>knot</b> is a four strand diamond <b>knot</b> implemented in two strands. The knife lanyard <b>knot</b> is, [...] "tied alike," [...] the Chinese button <b>knot,</b> [...] "but they are worked differently." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{crossing}} {{number of}} a granny <b>knot</b> is six, {{which is the}} smallest possible crossing number for a composite <b>knot.</b> Unlike the square <b>knot,</b> the granny <b>knot</b> is not a ribbon <b>knot</b> or a slice <b>knot.</b>|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, {{especially}} {{in the area of}} topology known as <b>knot</b> theory, an invertible <b>knot</b> is a <b>knot</b> that can be continuously deformed to itself, but with its orientation reversed. A non-invertible <b>knot</b> is any <b>knot</b> which does not have this property. The invertibility of a <b>knot</b> is a <b>knot</b> invariant. An invertible link is the link equivalent of an invertible <b>knot.</b>|$|R
5|$|Abby Fairgate (formerly Cunningham, Ewing and Sumner) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the CBS soap opera <b>Knots</b> Landing, a long-running serial about middle class {{life on the}} fictional cul-de-sac known as Seaview Circle in Los Angeles, California. She was played by actress Donna Mills between 1980 and 1989. Abby was created by producer David Jacobs as one of <b>Knots</b> Landing earliest characters. She debuted in the first episode of the second season. Mills remained a principal actor in the series until she left in its tenth season. She returned for the two-part series finale to provide closure for the fans. The character made her last television appearance in 1997, when she appeared in the <b>Knots</b> Landing reunion series , and was reunited with former cast members.|$|E
5|$|During John's {{time in the}} Western North Pacific, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) had {{particular}} difficulty in forecasting and even estimating the strength of John. John weakened considerably after entering the Western North Pacific, and, before estimates were later revised, four consecutive advisories were issued that declared John a tropical depression. Each of these advisories called for imminent dissipation. As John persisted and did not dissipate as the JTWC had predicted, it was upgraded to a minimal tropical storm in the next advisory. At the same time, however, two separate ship reports indicated that John had sustained winds of at least 55 <b>knots</b> (100 km/h, 65 mph), far stronger than the advisory strength of 35 <b>knots</b> (65 km/h, 40 mph). John {{would go on to}} restrengthen into a strong Category 1 hurricane after reentering the Central North Pacific, defying all JTWC predictions. After later reanalysis, the JTWC raised the estimated wind speeds of John for every advisory from 1200 UTC September 1 to its final advisory exactly a week later by at least 5 <b>knots</b> (9 km/h, 6 mph) and as much as 25 <b>knots</b> (46 km/h, 29 mph).|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Vakhmistrov devised Zveno-SPB (SPB: Sostavnoi Pikiruyuschiy Bombardirovschik, Combined Dive Bomber) which {{consisted}} of a Tupolev TB-3-4AM-34FRN mothership and two Polikarpov I-16 Type 5 fighters. Each of the fighters was armed {{with a pair of}} 250kg (550lb) FAB-250 high-explosive bombs. Although an I-16 Type 5 could get airborne on its own with no more than 100kg (220lb) of bombs, once hoisted in the air by the TB-3 it could reach 410km/h (220 <b>knots,</b> 255mph) at 2500 m (8,200ft), had a service ceiling of 6800 m (22,310ft), and could dive at up to 650km/h (350 <b>knots,</b> 405mph). Once the bombs were dropped, the SPB-launched I-16s performed like conventional Type 5s. The three-aircraft Zveno-SPB had a total takeoff weight of 22000kg (48,500lb), a top speed of 268km/h (145 <b>knots,</b> 165mph), and a range of 2500km (1,350 NM, 1,550mi). The use of a mothership increased the range of the I-16s by 80%.|$|E
50|$|The San Diego Jam <b>knot</b> is {{a common}} fishing <b>knot</b> used to tie a line to the hook, swivel, clip, or {{artificial}} fly. This <b>knot</b> {{is also known as}} the San Diego <b>knot,</b> Reverse clinch <b>knot</b> or Heiliger <b>knot.</b>|$|R
50|$|The cross {{constrictor}} <b>knot</b> {{is harder}} to tighten, harder to untie, more stable, builds more <b>knot</b> height than the double constrictor <b>knot,</b> more <b>knot</b> width than either constrictor <b>knot</b> or the strangle <b>knot</b> due to 3 turns rather than 2.|$|R
50|$|A {{wall and}} crown <b>knot</b> {{consists}} of a wall <b>knot</b> and a crown <b>knot</b> with doubled strands. A wall <b>knot</b> may be described as an upside down crown <b>knot.</b> The strands of the wall <b>knot</b> go over, under twice, and over, while the strands of the crown <b>knot</b> go under, over twice, and under. In the wall and crown <b>knot</b> they are tied in opposite directions.|$|R
5|$|Starbursts {{are often}} {{associated}} with merging or interacting galaxies. The prototype {{example of such a}} starburst-forming interaction is M82, which experienced a close encounter with the larger M81. Irregular galaxies often exhibit spaced <b>knots</b> of starburst activity.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} types of monsoons in the state. The {{southwest}} monsoon season is usually established in the later half of May or early June and ends in September. The prevailing wind flow is generally southwesterly and light, below 15 <b>knots.</b> The northeast monsoon season usually starts in early November and ends in March. During this season, steady easterly or northeasterly winds of 10 to 20 <b>knots</b> prevail. The winds over the east coast states of Peninsular Malaysia may reach 30 <b>knots</b> or more during periods of strong surges of cold air from the north (cold surges). The annual rainfall of this area is 2,911 millimetres. During the northeast monsoon season, Kuala Terengganu, being exposed to the coast, receives heavy rainfall. It is not advised to visit any of the offshore islands or participating in sea activities as the sea can be very rough. However, in some clear sunny days during the monsoon season, surprisingly east coast is always presented with clear blue sky and cooling wind.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear {{refers to}} the {{variation}} of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in airspeed of 30 <b>knots</b> (15m/s) for light aircraft, and near 45 <b>knots</b> (22m/s) for airliners at flight altitude. Vertical speed changes greater than 4.9knots (2.5m/s) also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft. Low level wind shear can affect aircraft airspeed during {{take off and landing}} in disastrous ways, and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind shear (headwind loss in excess of 30 <b>knots).</b> The rationale for this additional caution includes: (1) microburst intensity can double in a minute or less, (2) the winds can shift to excessive cross wind, (3) 40-50 <b>knots</b> is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and (4) several of the historical wind shear accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts. Wind shear is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind shear.|$|E
5000|$|The double fisherman's <b>knot</b> or grapevine <b>knot</b> is a bend, or a <b>knot</b> used to join two {{lengths of}} rope. This <b>knot</b> and the triple fisherman's <b>knot</b> are the {{variations}} used {{most often in}} climbing, arboriculture, and search and rescue. The <b>knot</b> is formed by tying a double overhand <b>knot,</b> in its strangle <b>knot</b> form, with each end around the opposite line's standing part.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, this <b>knot</b> {{can replace}} the figure-eight <b>knot</b> when tying into a climbing harness by tying a regular bowline <b>knot</b> and then re-threading it, such as {{is done with}} a figure eight <b>knot.</b> However, {{it is critical to}} use a strong backup <b>knot</b> with plenty of tail beyond the <b>knot,</b> as the <b>knot</b> may untie during long climbs. The advantage of using this <b>knot</b> instead of the figure eight <b>knot</b> is that it can be easily untied after a severe fall.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the granny <b>knot,</b> {{the square}} <b>knot</b> is a ribbon <b>knot,</b> {{and it is}} {{therefore}} also a slice <b>knot.</b>|$|R
5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a quartz glass portal {{in the belly}} of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 <b>knots</b> (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{generally}} regarded as somewhat of a rival of J.R. in the fictional world of Dallas, Gary Ewing (Ted Shackelford) was not a suspect due to his activity in the related fictional <b>Knots</b> Landing world.

5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual <b>knots</b> were used to tie the body, and the same <b>knots</b> were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E

5000|$|The reef <b>knot,</b> or square <b>knot,</b> is {{an ancient}} and simple binding <b>knot</b> used to secure a rope or line around an object.

A common mnemonic for this procedure is [...] "right over left; left over right", which is often appended with the rhyming suffix [...] "... makes a <b>knot</b> both tidy and tight". Two consecutive overhands of the same handedness will make a granny <b>knot.</b> The working ends of the reef <b>knot</b> must emerge both at the top or both at the bottom, otherwise a thief <b>knot</b> results.|$|R
50|$|The {{strangle}} <b>knot</b> is {{a simple}} binding <b>knot.</b> Similar to the constrictor <b>knot,</b> it also features an overhand <b>knot</b> under a riding turn.
