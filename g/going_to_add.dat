Originally, Hauge had a different title for the episode, [...] "Mutual of Moemaha", parodying the name of the Mutual of Omaha insurance company.

500|$|Romney's {{greatest}} weakness {{was a lack}} {{of foreign}} policy expertise and a need for a clear position on the Vietnam War. [...] The press coverage of the trip focused on Vietnam and reporters were frustrated by Romney's initial reluctance to speak about it. [...] The qualities that helped Romney as an industry executive worked against him as a presidential candidate; he had difficulty being articulate, often speaking at length and too forthrightly on a topic and then later correcting himself while maintaining he was not. [...] Reporter Jack Germond joked that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> a single key on his typewriter that would print, [...] "Romney later explained...." [...] Life magazine wrote that Romney [...] "manages to turn self-expression into a positive ordeal" [...] and that he was no different in private: [...] "nobody can sound more like the public George Romney than the real George Romney let loose to ramble, inevitably away from the point and toward some distant moral precept." ...|$|E
500|$|Loup is a left-handed pitcher, or southpaw. He {{struggled}} {{at first}} with pitching until minor league pitching instructor Dane Johnson and Dunedin pitching coach Darold Knowles {{told him to}} lower his arm and {{become more of a}} sidearm pitcher. Now, as he pitches, he tracks a plane from his ear to his shoulder, which also helped his effectiveness against left-handed batters. His slider and fastball improved drastically, but his changeup continued to struggle, and Loup says that he is still a little inconsistent with it. He can throw a low-90s [...] "breaking" [...] fastball that is just as effective against right-handed batters as left-handed batters. John Farrell, a previous Toronto Blue Jays manager, said that it was [...] " [...] poise and his presence that allows him to maintain not only composure, but the ability to execute." [...] Blue Jays' bullpen coach Pat Hentgen says that Loup [...] "keeps things simple, he doesn't over-think. He stays aggressive. He's got a lot of guts, goes right after hitters and you combine all those things and you're going to have the success that he's had." [...] One reporter compared Loup to Bran Flakes, stating that [...] "ou know exactly what you're going to get from him every time he takes the mound and he's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> any excitement to any situation." ...|$|E

"What {{was said}} in court was a defense {{argument}} made that we put a cloud over the White House, as if, one, we were inventing something or, two, making something up, in order to convince the jury {{that they ought to}} convict. And I think in any case where you feel that someone's making an argument that you are inventing something or improperly casting a cloud on someone, you respond. And we responded fairly and honestly by saying there was a cloud there caused by – not caused by us. And by Mr. Libby obstructing justice and lying about what happened, he had failed to remove the cloud. And sometimes when people tell the truth, clouds disappear. And sometimes they don't. But when you don't know what's happening, that's a problem. And so {{the fact that there was}} a cloud over anyone was not our doing. It was the facts of the case. It was the facts of the case. It was aggravated by Mr. Libby telling falsehoods. And that's what we said. We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> to that or subtract to that. That's what we said in court, and that's the context in which we said it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Game {{began as}} a spec screenplay, written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris in 1991. It was sold that year to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who put the project in turnaround, where it {{was picked up by}} Propaganda Films. Director Jonathan Mostow was {{originally}} attached to the project with Kyle MacLachlan and Bridget Fonda cast in the lead roles. Principal photography was to start in February 1993 but in early 1992, the project was moved to PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. Mostow was no longer the director of the film but instead became an executive producer. Producer Steve Golin bought the script from MGM and gave it to David Fincher in the hopes that he would direct. Fincher liked the various plot twists but brought in Andrew Kevin Walker, who had worked with him on Seven, to make the character of Nicholas more cynical in nature. Fincher and Walker spent six weeks changing the tone and trying to make the story work. According to David Fincher, there were three primary influences on The Game. Michael Douglas' character was a [...] "fashionable, good-looking Scrooge, lured into a [...] situation with a steroid shot in the thigh from The Sting". He {{said in an interview that}} his film differs from others of that kind because [...] "movies usually make a pact with the audience that says: we're going to play it straight. What we show you is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> up. But we don't do that. In that respect, it's about movies and how movies dole out information". Furthermore, Fincher has said that the film is about [...] "loss of control. The purpose of The Game is to take your greatest fear, put it this close to your face and say 'There, you're still alive. It's all right.'" [...] More revisions were made to the script, including removing a scene where Nicholas kills Christine and then commits suicide, because Fincher felt that this did not make sense. In 1996, Larry Gross and Walker were brought in to make further revisions to the script.|$|E
