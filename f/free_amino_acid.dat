5|$|The {{composition}} of the volatile flavour compounds of Suillellus luridus consists largely of linoleic acid, with smaller proportions of 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid methyl ester, and heptadecanoic acid. Pyrazine compounds might {{be responsible for the}} characteristic odour of the dried mushroom. The predominant sterol present in the fruit bodies is ergosterol, with smaller amounts of closely related derivative compounds. The main fatty acids of the mushroom include linoleic acid (53.4% of total fatty acids), oleic acid (24.1%), and palmitic acid (10.2%).

Among the few exceptions are two nickel- and two copper-containing MOFs synthesized by Rosseinsky and co-workers. These compounds employ amino acids(L- or D-aspartate) together with dipyridyls as struts. The coordination chemistry is such that the amine group of the aspartate cannot be protonated by added HCl, {{but one of the}} aspartate carboxylates can. Thus, the framework-incorporated amino acid can exist in a form that is not accessible for the <b>free</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid.</b> While the nickel-based compounds are marginally porous, on account of tiny channel dimensions, the copper versions are clearly porous.|$|E
