40|$|We use Raman {{amplification}} in hydrogen-filled hollow-core kagome {{photonic crystal}} fiber to generate high energy pulses in pure single <b>higher-order</b> <b>modes.</b> The desired <b>higher-order</b> <b>mode</b> at the Stokes frequency is precisely seeded by injecting a pulse {{of light from}} the side, using a prism to select the required modal propagation constant. An intense pump pulse in the fundamental mode transfers its energy to the Stokes seed pulse with measured gains exceeding 60 dB and output pulse energies as high as 8 mu J. A pressure gradient is used to suppress stimulated Raman scattering into the fundamental mode at the Stokes frequency. The growth of the Stokes pulse energy is experimentally and theoretically investigated for six different <b>higher-order</b> <b>modes.</b> The technique has significant advantages over the use of spatial light modulators to synthesize <b>higher-order</b> <b>mode</b> patterns, since {{it is very difficult to}} perfectly match the actual eigenmode of the fiber core, especially for <b>higher-order</b> <b>modes</b> with complex multi-lobed transverse field profiles.

40|$|The {{accelerating}} {{system of}} the LHC consists of two structures per beam, each composed of four superconducting single-cell cavities.

40|$|Current {{searches}} for the gravitational-wave signature of compact binary mergers rely on matched-filtering data from interferometric observatories with sets of modelled gravitational waveforms. These searches currently use model waveforms that {{do not include the}} <b>higher-order</b> <b>mode</b> content of the gravitational-wave signal. <b>Higher-order</b> <b>modes</b> are important for many compact binary mergers and their omission reduces the sensitivity to such sources.

40|$|The free {{electron}} laser (FEL) is proposed to meet the Navy's need for a speed-of-light high energy laser weapon capable of engaging a variety of targets including anti-ship cruise missiles, small boats, and theater ballistic missiles. A key attribute of FELs is good optical beam quality; in other words, they operate {{in only a few}} of the lowest-order transverse Gaussian modes. For weapons applications, a good mode quality is desired because it delivers the highest intensity on target ensuring a high level of lethality. A few <b>higher-order</b> <b>modes</b> can arise from the interaction of the electron beam with the optical beam, or from misalignments of the electron beam or resonator mirrors. High intensity on FEL optics can lead to mirror distortion due to heating and insufficient cooling of the mirror substrate. Mirror distortions, including astigmatism, can cause <b>higher-order</b> <b>modes</b> to appear affecting FEL performance. Therefore, it is important to quantify these <b>higher-order</b> <b>modes</b> because doing so uniquely identifies the optical field and may allow for corrective optics to single out the best modes for FEL lethality.
