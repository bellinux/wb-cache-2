In 1999, Ryan supported the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed some financial regulation of banks from the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933. During the economic recovery from the Great Recession of the late 2000s, Ryan supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which authorized the Treasury to purchase toxic assets from banks and other financial <b>institutions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> auto industry bailout; Ryan opposed the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which expanded consumer protections regarding credit card plans, and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which strengthened financial regulation.|$|E
5|$|While Roman and Celtic Christianity {{were very}} similar in {{doctrine}} and both accepted ultimate papal authority, there were differences in practice. The most contentious were the method of calculating Easter, and the form of head shaving for priests known as tonsure. Other differences were in the rites of ordination and baptism, and {{in the form of}} service of the liturgy. In addition scholars have identified significant characteristics of the organisation of Irish and Scottish Christianity as relaxed ideas of clerical celibacy, intense secularisation of ecclesiastical <b>institutions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lack of a diocesan structure. This made abbots (or coarbs), rather than bishops, the most important element the church hierarchy.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} how {{the relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> producing texts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> intended reader of the text is construed in Swedish institutional texts about pensions from both Sweden <b>and</b> Finland. <b>The</b> texts are published in 2012 by Pensionsmyndigheten, the Swedish Pensions Agency, <b>and</b> Kela, <b>the</b> social security institution in Finland. The theoretical framework {{of the study is}} systemic-functional linguistics (see Halliday & Matthiessen 2004). The article studies what lexicogrammatic alterms are used to name <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reader, what processes <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reader are participants in and what ergative roles <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reader are assigned in the processes. The results show that there are differences between the texts in all three cases. For example, in the Swedish texts the most common ergative role for both <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reader is Medium, followed by Beneficiary <b>and</b> Agent. In <b>the</b> Finland-Swedish texts, however, the institution is most commonly Agent, followed by Medium <b>and</b> Beneficiary, whereas <b>the</b> reader is most commonly construed as Beneficiary, followed by Medium <b>and</b> Agent. <b>The</b> results show that {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reader is construed as more explicitly asymmetrical <b>and</b> authoritative in <b>the</b> Finland-Swedish texts than in the Swedish texts...|$|R
5|$|Brezhnev's family, Yuri, Galina and Yuri Churbanov, were {{investigated}} and all, {{with the exception}} of Galina, were arrested on charges of political corruption during Mikhail Gorbachev's administration. Churbanov, Brezhnev's son-in-law, was sentenced to twelve years in prison on charges of large-scale embezzlement and corruption. By December 1988 Churbanov had been stripped of all state honours, and sent to a labour camp. Galina, {{along with the rest of}} Brezhnev's family, lost all their state privileges. The city of Brezhnev reverted to its old name Naberezhnye Chelny, and a group within the Soviet leadership wanted to rename all towns, street, factories and institutions bearing Brezhnev's name. This was actually carried through by the authorities in December 1988 when the Soviet Government issued a decree which stated all town, streets, factories, <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> like bearing Brezhnev's and Konstantin Chernenko's were to revert to their former name. According to his grandson Andrei Brezhnev, the very name Brezhnev had become a curse for the family, and several family members had been forced out of their jobs and their friends had deserted them. Brezhnev, who had inflated his role in World War II, was rescinded the Order of Victory on 21 September 1989 in a Supreme Soviet convocation.|$|E
5|$|In 1173, Saladin sent Turan-Shah {{to conquer}} Yemen and the Hejaz. Muslim writers Ibn al-Athir and later al-Maqrizi {{wrote that the}} {{reasoning}} behind the conquest of Yemen was an Ayyubid fear that should Egypt fall to Nur al-Din, they could seek refuge in a faraway territory. In May 1174, Turan-Shah conquered Zabid from a Kharijite dynasty and executed its leader Mahdi Abd al-Nabi, and later that year Aden {{was taken from the}} Shia Banu Karam tribe. Aden became the principal maritime port of the dynasty in the Indian Ocean and the principal city of Yemen, although the official capital of Ayyubid Yemen was Ta'iz. The advent of the Ayyubids marked the beginning of a period of renewed prosperity in the city which saw the improvement of its commercial infrastructure, the establishment of new <b>institutions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> minting of its own coins. Following this prosperity, the Ayyubids implemented a new tax which was collected by galleys.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, 2007, Columbia University {{announced}} a $400m to $600m donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge {{to be used}} exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education. Its exact value {{will depend on the}} eventual value of Kluge's estate {{at the time of his}} death; however, the generous donation has helped change financial aid policy at Columbia. Annual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. As of 2008, undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies. In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the Common Application. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> last Ivy League university to switch to the Common Application.|$|E

5|$|The {{push for}} this change was {{the reign of}} David I and the Davidian Revolution. Feudalism, {{government}} reorganisation and the first legally recognised towns (called burghs) began in this period. These <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> immigration of French and Anglo-French knights and churchmen facilitated cultural osmosis, whereby the culture and language of the low-lying and coastal parts of the kingdom's original territory in the east became, like the newly acquired south-east, English-speaking, {{while the rest of}} the country retained the Gaelic language, apart from the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland, which remained under Norse rule until 1468. The Scottish state entered a largely successful and stable period between the 12th and 14th centuries, there was relative peace with England, trade and educational links were well developed with the Continent and at the height of this cultural flowering John Duns Scotus was one of Europe's most important and influential philosophers.|$|E
