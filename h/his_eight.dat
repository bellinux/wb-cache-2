5|$|After {{scores of}} 6 and 12 in the Fourth Test, {{he missed the}} final Test due to injury, ending an {{unproductive}} Test summer in which he managed only 186 runs at 23.25. The series was noted for Morris' difficulties against the spin duo of Alf Valentine and Sonny Ramadhin, who bowled left-arm orthodox and leg spin respectively. The pair was responsible for five of <b>his</b> <b>eight</b> dismissals on the tour. Morris did not play a match after the new year and ended the season with 698 runs at 53.69. He topped his state's Shield batting averages, leading from the front as New South Wales regained the title.|$|E
5|$|As a {{young man}} he married Rampanambonitany. Oral history {{provides}} two conflicting accounts of their marriage. According to one version, the couple had no children of their own, leading the king to adopt the eight daughters and five sons of his sister Rangorinimerina. In another version, {{at least some of}} the five sons and eight daughters issued from the king's marriage, and his son Rakotomavo was adopted from a woman called Rangorimanana. The remaining four sons were named Andriantoarana, Andriamohara, Ratsimanjaka and Andriampalimana. The names of only three of <b>his</b> <b>eight</b> daughters are preserved in the oral histories: Randriamizaza, Rahisatra and Rahira.|$|E

5|$|As word {{increased}} of Bayh's intentions, {{political scientists}} opined on the detractions of a run. Citing {{the fact that}} <b>his</b> <b>eight</b> years as governor may be nullified by its distance in time and that his visibility in the Senate was low, critics pondered whether moderate voters may {{be more inclined to}} line with possible candidate Mark Warner of Virginia. However, this criticism subsided once Warner decided against a run in October 2006.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 193637 season, Miller was {{selected}} for the Colts, a state under-21 team that played at district level. At the end of the 1936 school year, Miller completed year 10 by passing five of <b>his</b> <b>eight</b> subjects. Disinclined towards university studies, he left school without finishing his leaving year and began working as a clerk for a car business. Miller felt confident that he could make a career out of sport and therefore felt that further education was unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, he was the oldest United States combat veteran ever, the oldest male ever {{recorded}} in Mississippi and had outlived at least three of <b>his</b> <b>eight</b> children. It was reported that he had several dozen grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He was also ranked as the sixth-oldest living verified person in the world, the second-oldest man and World War I veteran behind only del Toro and the last African American one. Although he suffered from mild dementia in his later years, he was reported to have been completely lucid through his final days and his death was attributed to natural causes.|$|E
50|$|In 1948, while tending {{shoes of}} namazies (prayer people) outside Australasia mosque, Lahore, to earn some money, he {{discovered}} his separated father and brothers.

5|$|Burrell {{filed for}} free agency on November 6. On December 16, the Phillies signed left fielder Raúl Ibañez to a three-year contract, ending Burrell's tenure in Philadelphia. Burrell's 104 double plays {{grounded}} into were the seventh-most in Phillies history, and his 1,273 strikeouts were {{second only to}} Schmidt. However, Burrell was fifth in walks (785), eighth in RBI (827), and fourth in home runs (251) as a Phillie. <b>His</b> <b>eight</b> straight seasons with at least 20 home runs were topped only by Schmidt.|$|E
5|$|During <b>his</b> <b>eight</b> seasons {{playing for}} the Yokohama BayStars, Bobby Rose hit for three cycles, {{the most of any}} Nippon Professional Baseball player. Each spaced two seasons apart, his first cycle {{occurred}} on May 2, 1995, the next on April 29, 1997, and his final cycle on June 30, 1999. Other than Rose, only two NPB players have hit multiple cycles: Fumio Fujimura with the Osaka Tigers and Hiromi Matsunaga with the Hankyu/Orix Braves, both with two. Fujimura is also the only player to have hit a cycle during both the single league era and the current dual league era.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{was forced}} to {{shoulder}} more responsibility in the batting order now that Bradman had retired and Sid Barnes took an extended break. The youngest player in the team, Harvey rose to the challenge by establishing several Australian records. His Test figures of 660 at 132.00 was the most runs on a Test tour of South Africa by a visiting batsman, surpassing Len Hutton's previous mark by 83 runs, as were his 1,526 first-class runs at 76.30 and eight centuries on tour. <b>His</b> <b>eight</b> first-class centuries on one South African tour equalled the efforts of Denis Compton, Len Hutton and Arthur Morris.|$|E

5|$|However, Taylor {{left the}} club {{to take up the}} manager's job at Crystal Palace and Colchester United's Phil Parkinson was {{confirmed}} as his replacement, but was sacked on 4 December 2006 with Hull in the relegation zone, despite having spent over £2million on players during the summer. Phil Brown took over as caretaker manager, and took over permanently in January 2007, having taken Hull out of the relegation zone. Brown brought veteran striker Dean Windass back to his hometown club on loan from Bradford City, and <b>his</b> <b>eight</b> goals helped secure Hull's Championship status as they finished in 21st place.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, while {{pitching}} on a wet mound in Cleveland, Shuey {{injured his}} right hip. Over {{the next several}} seasons, he had multiple surgeries on his hip, including repairing a torn labrum and removing bone spurs. He finished the 1999 season with an 8–5 record, a 3.53 ERA, and six saves. <b>His</b> <b>eight</b> wins tied for the most among Cleveland's relief pitchers. In 2000, new Indians' manager Charlie Manuel indicated the Indians would attempt to shift Shuey into the closer role. When Shuey spent time {{on the disabled list}}, Steve Karsay served as the Indians' closer. He again spent time on the disabled list in 2001 with a strained elbow ligament.|$|E
5|$|In August 1930, St Hill {{signed a}} {{contract}} to play professional cricket in the Lancashire League in England, which meant {{that he was no}} longer eligible to play cricket for Shannon or Trinidad. At the time, competition rules barred professional cricketers from taking part. Consequently, the first-class matches he played in Australia were the last of his career. In <b>his</b> <b>eight</b> seasons in the Bonanza Cup, St Hill took 224 wickets at an average of 9.42, and topped the bowling averages for the competition in 1924 and 1929.|$|E

5|$|Malone was {{survived by}} his wife Ida and <b>his</b> <b>eight</b> children. Although {{initially}} well provided with income from his farming estate, the depression of the 1920s impacted on the earnings of the farmland and Ida struggled financially. She eventually moved to England with her three children and a daughter from Malone's previous marriage and died there in 1946. His four oldest sons all served in the NZEF, and one, Maurice, was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Another son, Edmond, received the Military Cross while serving with the Wellington Regiment on the Western Front. He died on 6 April 1918, a few days after being wounded.|$|E
5|$|Motley {{took the}} 1954 season off and {{attempted}} a comeback in 1955 after the Browns, who still had rights to Motley under his contract, traded {{him to the}} Pittsburgh Steelers for Ed Modzelewski.

In <b>his</b> <b>eight</b> years in the AAFC and NFL, Motley had rushed for 4,712 yards and averaged 5.7 yards per carry. His career rushing average is still an all-time record for running backs.|$|E
