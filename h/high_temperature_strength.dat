To investigate the influences of the alloying elements of AISI 685 on the sulfidation behavior, nickel-base alloys containing each of chromium, cobalt, molybdenum, titanium, and aluminum (the major components of AISI 685), and alloys containing multiple such elements were produced and corroded in sulfidizing gas atmospheres at 600 ?C.

Six types of alloys, in which aluminum had been increased to improve the sulfidation resistance of AISI 685 and titanium decreased by the same proportion to maintain the <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>strengths</b> of AlSI 685, were forged to test their sulfidation behavior and <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>strengths.</b> As a result, the alloy with 1. 5 percent titanium and 3. 0 percent aluminum showed only half the sulfidation depth of AISI 685, for the tensile characteristics at 538 ?C, and at 850 ?C through 1100 ?C, equivalent or better than those of AISI 685.

5000|$|While Ni based {{superalloys}} {{are excellent}} high temperature materials and have proven very useful, Co based superalloys potentially possess superior hot corrosion, oxidation, and wear resistance {{as compared to}} Ni-based superalloys. For this reason, efforts have also been put into developing Co based superalloys {{over the past several}} years. Despite that, traditional Co based superalloys have not found widespread usage because they have a lower strength at high temperature than Ni based superalloys. The main {{reason for this is that}} they appear to lack the γ’ precipitation strengthening that is so important in the <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>strength</b> of Ni-based superalloys. A 2006 report on metastable γ’-Co3(Al,W) intermetallic compound with the L12 structure suggests Co based alloys as alternative to traditional Ni based superalloys. However this class of alloys was reported in a PhD thesis by C. S. Lee in 1971. The two-phase microstructure consists of cuboidal γ’ precipitates embedded in a continuous γ matrix and is therefore morphologically identical to the microstructure observed in Ni based superalloys. Like in the Ni-based system, there is a high degree of coherency between the two phases which is one of the main factors resulting in the superior strength at high temperatures. This provides a pathway for the development of a new class of load-bearing Co based superalloys for application in severe environments. In these alloys 'W' is the crucial addition for getting γ’ intermetallic compound that makes them much denser (>9.6 gm/cm3) compared to Ni-based superalloys. Recently a new class of γ - γ’ cobalt based superalloys have been developed that are [...] "W" [...] free and have much lower density comparable to nickel based superalloys. In addition to the fact that many of the properties of these new Co based superalloys could be better than those of the more traditional Ni based ones, Co also has a higher melting temperature than Ni. Therefore, if the <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>strength</b> could be improved, the development of novel Co based superalloys could allow for an increase in jet engine operation temperature resulting in an increased efficiency.|$|E

Micro cracks caused by wear or thermal stress are filled with oxides formed from the MAX phase constituents, commonly the A-element, during high temperature exposure to air.Crack gap filling was first demonstrated for Ti3AlC2 by oxidation at 1200 °C in air. Ti2AlC and Cr2AlC have also demonstrated said ability, and more ternary carbides and nitrides {{are expected to be}} able to autonomously self-heal. The process is repeatable up to the point of element depletion, distinguishing MAX phases from other self-healing materials that require external healing agents (extrinsic healing) for single crack gap filling. Depending on the filling-oxide, improvement of the initial properties such as local strength can be achieved.On the other hand, mullite, alumina and zirconia do not have the ability to heal intrinsically, but could be endowed with self-healing capabilities by embedding second phase components into the matrix. Upon cracking, these particles are exposed to oxygen, and in the presence of heat, they react to form new materials which fill the crack gap under volume expansion.This concept has been proven using SiC to heal cracks in an Alumina matrix, and further studies have investigated the <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>strength,</b> and the static and cyclic fatigue strength of the healed part.
