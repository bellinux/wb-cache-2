However, he decided that since he had the same kind of players on the Flyers as he <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minors, he would use the same systems, becoming the first coach to employ systems.|$|E

Coach Smith expressed concerns over Georgetown's shooting ability and feared that Floyd would come out shooting very well from the field. In addition, Smith noted that Ewing would play a large factor in the game because his defensive presence in the game limits second chance opportunities for Georgetown's opponents. Ken Rappoport of the Associated Press wrote of how North Carolina was a very disciplined team that takes only high-percentage shots.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the closure}} of the district's mines, the Wells Fargo office was used as a {{residence}} by Alex and Mayme Colbath until the 1950s. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 11, 1971, and currently serves as an art gallery and a museum. The Rice Building burned down, and was rebuilt in 1991. The Cosmopolitan Restaurant was reconstructed to appear as it <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, and it served European cuisine until it was closed in 2010. There are many remnants of houses and other buildings, and there are also markers indicating where some buildings once stood, such as the Elk Horn Saloon.

5|$|In 1905, Alberta Lieutenant Governor George Bulyea asked Rutherford to {{form the}} new province's first government. As premier, his first task was to win a {{workable}} majority in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, which he <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1905 provincial election. His second was to provide the apparatus of provincial government: his government established everything from speed limits to a provincial court system. The legislature also controversially, and with Rutherford's support, selected Edmonton over rival Calgary as the provincial capital. Calgarians' bruised feelings were not salved when the government located the University of Alberta, a project dear to the Premier's heart, {{in his hometown of}} Strathcona, just across the North Saskatchewan River from Edmonton.|$|E

As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, Weaver and Chambers hoped to make inroads in the South.
