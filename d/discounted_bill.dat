In 1965 and 1966, the bank assisted the company by <b>discounting</b> <b>bills</b> and promissory notes from two furnishing companies. Not only was the bank not informed that these bills and notes were in fact accommodation bills; Zinn also fraudulently entered false invoice numbers on these bills in order to present evidence of their being genuine trade bills and notes—the Bank being prohibited from <b>discounting</b> accommodation <b>bills.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Section 17 of the Act defines {{manner in}} which the RBI can conduct business. The RBI can accept {{deposits}} from the central and state governments without interest.

It can provide loans to banks and state financial corporations. It can provide advances to the central government and state governments. It can buy or sell government securities.

30|$|Secondly, for {{the most}} {{advanced}} European financial centres around 1900, regressing the short-term interest from <b>discounting</b> <b>bills</b> in the local money markets onto the return implied in foreign bills of exchange yields coefficients that come at least close to the interest-parity condition. This lends support to the historical claim that the so-called investment demand for bills of exchange aligned the exchange rates of the major gold-backed currencies with the money market discount rates. Given that massive deviations from the interest-parity condition (in particular with the uncovered version) have commonly been found with modern data, this is a remarkable result.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{importance}} of the expansion of credit was its role in foreign trade. Historians P. J. Cain and A.G. Hopkins note that [...] "gentlemanly capitalism" [...] (a class-conscious form of white-collar work in finance, insurance, shipping and the Empire) {{was the key to}} the growth of the Empire and its economic growth beginning in 1850. Historian David Kynaston notes the shift in the <b>discount</b> <b>bills</b> in the 1860s, particularly to finance supplies for the U.S. War between the States, and Richard Roberts describes the 1860s, 1870s and 1880s as the [...] "internationalisation of the discount market".|$|R

Furthermore, he studied the conditions in which the issue should take place and put forward some proposals that led to the organisation of the working rules of Banque de France. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} an uncovered interest parity (UIP) {{condition that}} arguably held {{as regards the}} continental investment demand for London bills of exchange during the classical gold standard. At that time, practical guide books about the foreign exchanges explained in detail how exchange and interest rates were connected.

30|$|This paper {{examines}} interest-parity {{conditions that}} arguably held {{as regards the}} investment demand for bills of exchange during the classical gold standard (1880 – 1914). Contemporaneous guides to the foreign exchanges report that close connections between the exchange and discount rates arose mainly with bills traded in London and the major financial centres on the European continent. As implied by the interest-parity condition, and in particular when future exchange-rate movements were covered by a suitable long-bill transaction, weekly data do suggest that between Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, and London, the return from <b>discounting</b> <b>bills</b> of exchange in the local money market was roughly equivalent to the return from investing in foreign currency bills.|$|R

The Banque was nationalized in 1936 and its governing council was staffed by officials with a mandate to represent various interests in society. The Banque's autonomy was largely restored in 1973, and the Banque became officially independent in 1994. Whereas the Banque had originally lent appreciable sums to the Treasury, such lending {{was scheduled to be}} eliminated beginning in 1993 as part of the move toward monetary union. At that time the monetary policy operations of the Banque were revised substantially.

40|$|In the {{previous}} Lecture I explained how <b>discounting</b> <b>bills</b> of exchange was invented, how {{the discount rate}} appeared, and how changes in the propensity to consume made it go upor down. I also presented the important argument that the discount rate is entirely different in origin and nature from the rate of interest. We still have one mystery to solve, namely the question: Is there one discount rate or are there many discount rates? Is the clothier discounting at one rate and the baker at another, or are all retailers discounting {{at the same rate}}? The next Chapter in The Greatest Story Ever Told will answer that problem. Chapter Seven in which the gentle reader learns why the baker discounts {{at the same rate as}} the clothier The clothier noticed that his success in trading bills of exchange attracted imitators. The miller was also drawing bills on the baker and used them to pay the grain merchant for the wheat, after the bill was accepted by the baker. In holding the miller-on-baker bill the grain merchant was earning an income on his idle cash, just as the spinner, holding the weaver-on-clothier bill, was earning an income on his...|$|R
50|$|Social {{protection}} measures {{to ensure that}} piped water remains affordable can be broadly classified into income support measures and tariff-related measures. Income support measures address the individual customer’s ability to pay from the income side (through income assistance, water services vouchers, tariff rebates and <b>discounts,</b> <b>bill</b> re-phasing and easier payment plans, arrears forgiveness). An example of income assistance to poor users is the subsidy system applied in Chile. Tariff-related measures keep the size of water bills low for certain groups (e.g. refinement of increasing-block tariffs, tariff choice, tariff capping). Examples of increasing block tariffs with a price of zero in the first block are found in Flanders and South Africa. Another measure is the cross-subsidization using different tariffs for different neighborhoods, as practiced in Colombia. A similar approach has been used {{at the national level}} in Portugal. The Portuguese economic water regulator carried out an affordability study that found out that 10.5% of the population paid more than 3% of their income for water and wastewater services. As a result, the regulator showed flexibility concerning tariff increases and tariff solutions in municipalities where affordability was a particular issue.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{collapse}} of Overend Gurney {{and the ensuing}} crisis of 1866 {{was a turning point}} in British financial history: this was the last time a serious disruption took place in the London money market until 2007 - 8. The achievement of relative stability was due to the Bank’s willingness to offer generous assistance to the market in a crisis, combined with an elaborate system for discouraging moral hazard. The Bank’s assistance was not anonymous because it monitored the names on its <b>discounted</b> <b>bills.</b> When Overend Gurney sought extraordinary assistance from the Bank, their request was refused {{on the grounds that the}} bills offered did not comply with standard eligibility rules. The Bank’s refusal forced Overend to suspend payments and there was a general panic in the market. The Bank responded by lending freely and raising Bank rate to very high levels. The new policy was crucial in allowing for the establishment of sterling as an international currency. When in 1890 Baring Bros got into trouble, however, the Bank reacted differently and set up a bailout of the failing institution. Such such a contrasting attitude was dictated by the dissimilar position occupied by Overends (a bill broker) and Barings (an accepting house) within the London money market...|$|R

5000|$|The {{wealth that}} came to Gurney from his father-in-law, {{as well as that}} bequeathed to him by his father, helped him to rapid {{progress}} as a partner in Richardson and Overend, with which he had become connected in 1807. The business had been founded in 1800 by Thomas Richardson, clerk to a London bill discounter, and John Overend, chief clerk in the bank of Smith, Payne & Company in Nottingham, with the Gurneys supplying the capital. At that time <b>bill</b> <b>discounting</b> was carried on sporadically by ordinary merchants in addition to their regular business, but Richardson considered that there was room for a London house that would itself entirely to trading in bills. This novel idea proved an instant success. On his father's death in 1809, Samuel Gurney assumed the control of the Norwich bank. At the same time he took control of Richardson and Overend, whose name was subsequently changed to Overend, Gurney and Company. Very soon after Gurney entered the firm, it began to assume gigantic proportions. It was for about forty years the largest discounting house in the world. At first only <b>discounting</b> <b>bills,</b> it soon came to lending money on all sorts of securities. In the panic of 1825, the firm was able to lend money to many houses to tide them over their difficulties; this brought them into even greater favour. Gurney became known as [...] "the bankers' banker", and many firms which had previously dealt with the Bank of England now began depositing their surplus cash in its hands. At the time of Gurney's death in 1856, it was calculated that the house held deposits amounting to £8 million sterling. (However, the bank collapsed in 1866, owing millions.) ...|$|R
