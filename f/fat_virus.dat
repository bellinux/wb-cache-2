50|$|A <b>fat</b> <b>virus</b> is {{the popular}} {{name for the}} notion that some forms of obesity in humans and animals have a viral source. The AD-36 {{adenovirus}} has been observed {{to increase the amount}} of body fat in laboratory animals, an effect that has been duplicated in chickens and monkeys.|$|E
40|$|It is {{essential}} to rapidly and precisely diagnose rabies. In this study, we evaluated four diagnostic methods, indirect fluorescent antibody test (<b>FAT),</b> <b>virus</b> isolation (VI), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and rapid immunodiagnostic assay (RIDA), to detect rabies in animal brain homogenates. Out of the 110 animal brain samples tested, 20 (18. 2 %) were positive for rabies according to the FAT. Compared to the FAT, the sensitivities of VI, RT-PCR, and RIDA were 100, 100, and 95 %, respectively. The specificities of VI, RT-PCR and RIDA {{were found to be}} 100, 100, and 98. 9 %, respectively. Rabies viruses circulating in Korea were isolated and propagated in murine neuroblastoma (NG 108 - 15) cells with titers ranging from 101. 5 to 104. 5 TCID 50 /mL. Although the RIDA findings did not completely coincide with results obtained from FAT, VI, and RT-PCR, RIDA appears to be a fast and reliable assay {{that can be used to}} analyze brain samples. In summary, the results from our study showed that VI, RT-PCR, and RIDA can be used as supplementary diagnostic tools for detecting rabies viruses in both laboratory and field settings...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundA confirmatory rabies {{diagnosis}} can {{be achieved}} by rapid virus isolation in cell culture using brain tissue from the suspect animal. Several cell lines have been used for this purpose and the murine neuroblastoma cell line Neuro- 2 a {{has been found to be}} the most sensitive. The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK- 293 is known to express several neuronal proteins and is believed to be of neuronal origin. We hypothesized that this cell line could be susceptible to rabies virus, which is highly neurotropic. MethodsFirst we tested the sensitivity of HEK- 293 cells to the laboratory strain, challenge virus standard (CVS). We then tested 120 brain samples from different animals and humans suspected to have died of rabies by fluorescent antibody test (FAT). Both FAT-positive and FAT-negative brains were tested for virus isolation using Neuro- 2 a, BHK- 21, and HEK- 293 cell lines and also by mouse inoculation. ResultsThere was 100 % correlation between <b>FAT,</b> <b>virus</b> isolation in Neuro- 2 a and HEK- 293 cells, and mouse inoculation. However, the rate of virus isolation in the BHK- 21 cell line was only 28 % when compared to the other cell lines. The sensitivity of HEK- 293 to CVS strain of virus was similar to that of Neuro- 2 a. ConclusionsWe conclude that the HEK- 293 cell line is as sensitive as the Neuro- 2 a cell line for the rapid isolation of rabies virus and may serve as an alternative cell line for rabies diagnosis and future research...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{chemical}} analyses reveal {{that it is}} possible to secure preparations of elementary bodies of vaccinia that possess a considerable uniformity in their chemical constituents. Furthermore, the amounts of certain of these constituents, namely, nitrogen, alpha-amino nitrogen after hydrolysis, phosphorus, total fat, phospholipid, neutral fat, reducing sugar after hydrolysis, and cystine, in the purified virus are significantly different from those in the various materials discarded during the process of purification. The amounts of phospholipid and neutral <b>fat</b> in the <b>virus</b> preparations are not appreciably affected by extraction with ethyl ether or by digestion with lipase, procedures which do not inactivate the virus. Cholesterol, on the contrary, is apparently completely removed by these manipulations, and hence is not considered to play an important part in the economy of the virus...|$|R
40|$|A {{considerable}} part {{of tissue}} samples that are collected for the monitoring of {{classical swine fever}} (CSF) from the wild boar population or from domestic pigs are unsuitable for virus detection using the fluorescent antibody test (<b>FAT)</b> or <b>virus</b> isolation (VI), due to tissue degradation. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has a higher sensitivity than the FAT and VI, and {{is supposed to be}} less sensitive to sample degradation. Reliable and quantitative information on how long viral RNA and infectious virus can be detected in organs and which organs are most susceptible to degradation is, however, lacking. In the present study we generated survival curves of infectious CSF virus (CSFV) and viral RNA in the tonsil, mesenteric lymph node, spleen and kidney, obtained from 24 pigs infected with a moderately virulent CSFV strain. Tissue samples were stored at room temperature and tested by VI and RT-PCR, directly after storage and 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days later. It was shown that the RT-PCR is not only more sensitive than VI on fresh tissue samples, but RT-PCR is also less vulnerable to sample degradation. Average half-life values of viral RNA in the tissues ranged from 0. 95 to 2. 55 days, while half-life values of infectious virus ranged from 0. 21 to 0. 31 days. The tonsil and spleen are regarded as the most appropriate organs for the detection of infectious virus and viral RNA, not only in fresh samples, but also in samples that suffer from tissue degradatio...|$|R
40|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 1 is {{the cause}} of a severe respiratory disease in cattle known as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR). Restriction endonuclease analysis (REA) of thirteen Irish BHV 1 isolates indicates that both BHV 1 genotypes (BHV 1. 1 and BHV 1. 2) are present here. BHV 1. 1 has being associated with some of the more severe clinical diseases signs in recent years. A PCR assay to detect BHV 1 was developed using oligonucleotide primers chosen from the thymidine kinase (TK) gene. The assay was sensitive (< 1 TCID 50) and specific for BHV 1 and did not detect the live anti-IBR vaccine Tracherine (SmithKline Beecham). REA of PCR product with the enzymes Hae II and Taq I showed fragments of the expected size. Partial sequence data obtained from the amplification product also correlated with the published sequence data from this region. The assay was also designed to detect BHV 5 (formerly known as BHV 1. 3) which causes fatal encephalitis in young calves. Amplified product from BHV 5 could be distinguished from that of BHV 1 on the basis of product size and by restriction analysis with the restriction enzyme Taq I. The PCR assay compared favourably to two other routine methods of BHV 1 detection (fluorescent antibody test- <b>FAT</b> and <b>virus</b> isolation - VI) when applied to 105 diagnostic submissions from cattle with respiratory disease during a winter period (1992 - 1993). When used to detect BHV 1 in spiked semen samples, the assay detected virus at 1 TCID 50 thus offering a very attractive alternative technique to V I. Finally, the study involved the experimental inoculation of a BHV 1. 1 field isolate (associated with an outbreak of severe pharyngitis in neonatal calves) into calves. Mild clinical IBR infection ensued with little sign of the severe pharyngitis. Using REA isolates remained genotype BHV 1. 1 after passage in infected animals. PCR detected BHV 1 in more nasal secretion samples from infected calves than either VI or FAT...|$|R
