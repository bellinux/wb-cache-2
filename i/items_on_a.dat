In the course of the storyline, it is revealed that Josie is actually a sentient painting given life by a wealthy woman in the future as part of the woman's plan to grant herself immortality by transferring her mind into Josie, but Josie was rescued by the Twelfth Doctor and taken into the past so that she could travel with the Eighth, the Twelfth Doctor feeling that his past self was better suited to help Josie learn how to be human.|$|E

25|$|Differential item {{functioning}} (DIF), {{sometimes referred}} to as measurement bias, is a phenomenon when participants from different groups (ex gender, race, disability) with the same latent abilities give different answers to specific questions on the same IQ test. DIF analysis measures such specific <b>items</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> test alongside measuring participants latent abilities on other similar questions. A consistent different group response to a specific question among similar type of questions can indicate an effect of DIF. It does not count as differential item functioning if both groups have equally valid chance of giving different responses to the same questions. Such bias can be a result of culture, educational level and other factors that are independent of group traits. DIF is only considered if test-takers from different groups with the same underlying latent ability level have a different chance of giving specific responses. Such questions are usually removed {{in order to make the}} test equally fair for both groups. Common techniques for analyzing DIF are item response theory (IRT) based methods, Mantel-Haenszel, and logistic regression.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regular school}} {{material}} is compacted by pretesting {{the student to}} establish which skills and content have already been mastered. [...] Pretests can be presented {{on a daily basis}} (pupils doing the most difficult <b>items</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> worksheet first and skipping the rest if they are performed correctly), or before a week or longer unit of instructional time. [...] When a student demonstrates an appropriate level of proficiency, further repetitive practice can be safely skipped, thus reducing boredom and freeing up time for the student to work on more challenging material.|$|E
2500|$|Questionnaires {{are another}} very {{commonly}} used method of measurement. One {{example of a}} questionnaire is BASS; it is a 9-item subscale of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. It uses a rating scale from −2 to +2 and assesses eight body areas and attributes and overall appearance (face, hair, lower torso, mid-torso, upper torso, muscle tone, height, and weight).

2500|$|Among {{the most}} {{prominent}} of the traditional anti-Mormons are Jerald and Sandra Tanner. Both former members of the LDS Church, the Tanners converted to evangelical Protestantism and in 1964 founded the Modern Microfilm Company to [...] "document problems with the claims of Mormonism and to compare LDS doctrines with Christianity." [...] In 1983 they turned their company into a non-profit organization and renamed it the Utah Lighthouse Ministry. The Tanners' work has included [...] "publishing [...] many hard-to-find Mormon historical documents" [...] and [...] " [...] virtually every significant topic in Mormonism". During their prolific career they have published more than two hundred <b>items</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> variety of social, doctrinal, and historical issues. [...] Despite the high caliber of some of their work, the Tanners have been criticized on a number of points: notably for the vitriolic tone of some of their more polemical pieces, their resistance to change, and their unauthorized publication of several copyrighted documents.|$|E
2500|$|The annual University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt is a multi-day {{event in}} which large teams compete to obtain {{all of the}} {{notoriously}} esoteric <b>items</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> list.

Most teams fall well short of completing half of the list and instead compete for total points amassed.

2500|$|On 28 February 2012, an in-game feature was {{introduced}} called the [...] "Squeal of Fortune" [...] that allowed players to win <b>items</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> daily basis by spinning the wheel. On 2 April 2012, it became possible for players to spend real-world currency {{in exchange for}} additional spins, introducing a form of microtransaction to the game. Jagex CEO Mark Gerhard had previously described microtransactions as [...] "a stealth tax", and the update provoked complaints from players who believed they had been [...] "betrayed" [...] by the change. In July 2012, Jagex released Solomon's General Store, {{making it possible to}} spend real currency in exchange for [...] "RuneCoins" [...] that could be spent on cosmetic rewards in the game. On 29 August 2012, Gerhard released a response to this controversy, describing these microtransactions as [...] " [...] a significant role in ensuring that we can continue to support, develop and grow the game for many more years to come." [...] He states that while these decisions are [...] "not necessarily popular", they are made with the future of RuneScape in mind. On 4 February 2014, the Squeal of Fortune was replaced with Treasure Hunter. Rather than spinning a wheel for prizes, players are given keys which are used to open a chest of their choosing. On 26 March 2014, Gerhard reiterated his stance on microtransactions and their importance in updating RuneScape, and announced a partnership with Supersonic ads, allowing players to earn RuneCoins by watching advertisements or sampling products.|$|E
