Some newer DVD players feature a repair+skip algorithm, which alleviates this problem by {{continuing}} to play the disc, filling in unreadable areas of the picture with blank space or a <b>frozen</b> <b>frame</b> of the last readable image and sound. The success of this feature depends upon the amount of damage. LaserDisc players, when working in full analog, recover from such errors faster than DVD players. Direct comparison here is almost impossible due to the sheer size {{differences between the two}} media. A 1 in scratch on a DVD will probably cause more problems than a 1 in scratch on a LaserDisc, but a fingerprint taking up 1% of the area of a DVD would almost certainly cause fewer problems than a similar mark covering 1% of the surface of a LaserDisc.|$|E

40|$|The {{popularity}} of digital television is rapidly increasing. One of its impediments however, {{is the time}} it takes to switch from one channel to another. This paper proposes a way to smoothen channel transitions: In addition to the high quality stream, a number of channels is transmitted to the video client in low quality. When the user selects a new channel, the low quality version of the channel is displayed and the high quality version is requested. As soon as the high quality stream is available, high quality video is displayed. This way, the effect of channel switching can be reduced to the user observing lower resolution for a brief moment, instead of watching a blank screen or a <b>frozen</b> <b>frame.</b> In a lab environment, average channel switching time was reduced from 1400 milliseconds to 78 milliseconds...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Multiple {{description}} {{codes are}} designed for multiple path video streaming with channel diversities and an efficient MDC technique based on the applied spatial domain processing features. In this paper, we investigate the performance of multi-path video streaming using a multiple description coding (MDC) technique, especially the impacts of several codec variables, such as different lengths of the Group of Pictures (GOP), and the different startup times of I-frame in each independent MDC sub-streams. The overall performance {{of the system is}} evaluated by the frame dropout rate, which indicates the probability of playing back <b>frozen</b> <b>frames</b> of the reconstructed video at the receiver devices. To address dynamic channel conditions for video transmissions, we propose an adaptive coding technique by adjusting the GOP lengths according to the channel condition and combinatorial mathematics optimization in length of GOP adjustment. Different approaches, such as sub-dividing GOPs for a single stream and multiple sub-streams, and an adaptive MDC video streaming system, are examined in this paper...|$|R

When we open a door we fold one room into another.   I have investigated the door, as an object, a boarder and idea.   What defines something as closed or open? How long does it take to walk through a door? What happens to the door when I remove the walls around it?  In Fractions of an entrance I have used movement and the memory of movement to investigate the door. I investigate the door by  moving through, filming both me and the door, sketching and building the sequence into <b>frozen</b> <b>frames.</b> Through my investigation, the door has become a passage of doors that unfold movement and time.   The door works as an director, choreographing human movement, deciding how, if and when we enter a space. I have used movement as a  method because I believe that it is through movement that we perceive space, we constantly move and experience space from multiple  perspectives. I find it strange that the most common way to represent architecture is from a perspective that humans almost never see.   Fraction of an entrance is a representation of my perception of the opening of a door, it is not a new door or a door with a new function. It is a representation based on reflections and investigations of the door. The result is in itself a spacial design, with new spacial qualities.   That enhances invisible separations in space, create different patterns of movement an usage of space, creates smaller nooks to pause and gives you a possibility to remain in the moment between two rooms.

40|$|Internet {{traffic is}} growing {{by an average}} of 40 % a year and video {{streaming}} stands for 50 % of the traffic. The expansion of new applications and services for video distribution makes users demand video quality and faster loads for contents with higher resolutions. For that reason, it is necessary to improve detection systems with check the received contents and insure comfortable use. The wide variety of technologies for streaming and encoding systems make necessary the implementation of blind quality models that detect errors independently of the transmission source, focused on analyzing the decoded image as consumed by the final user. Additionally, the absence of a video reference in streaming systems oblige the creation of No-Reference quality metrics, because the content is not available to compare the video received with the original source. For that reason, this paper proposes a novel algorithm based on the detection transmission artefacts using visual VQA techniques in order to improve users' Quality of Experience (QoE). The algorithm is based on the detection of main streaming visual errors and artefacts, such as color degradation, <b>frozen</b> <b>frames,</b> complete absence of video or packet losses. The algorithm is included in a quality probe application that is part of a 5 G transmission network system for streaming high quality video. The algorithm analyzes the video quality for detecting streaming errors and the application warns the broadcaster for the retransmission of content if necessary. For the evaluation of the algorithm, a database of videos containing different types of errors was used in order to simulate streaming conditions and approach reality. The development of this application is necessary for the introduction of next generation 5 G telecommunications networks and the consequent new paradigm of video broadcasting...|$|R

40|$|Background Carotid intima media {{thickness}} (CIMT) measured with ultrasound (US) {{is widely used}} as biomarker for arteriosclerosis and as surrogate endpoint in interventional studies to assess efficacy of drug therapies. Strict US protocols are necessary to ensure reproducibility. The range of US signal intensities used for image formation, the dynamic range (DR), is rarely reported in studies and {{little is known about}} its effect on CIMT measurements in humans. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the impact of DR on measurements of CIMT. Methods US was used to examine 313 carotid arteries in participants from two different clinical studies. For each artery, images with DR of 40, 55, 70 and 85  dB were captured from the same <b>frozen</b> US <b>frame.</b> Mean CIMT (CIMTmean), maximum CIMT (CIMTmax) and standard deviation of CIMT (CIMTsd) were obtained for all images. CIMT for different DRs were compared using student t-test. Results CIMTmean for 40, 55, 70 and 85  dB were 0. 529, 0. 564, 0. 590 and 0. 605  mm respectively. For CIMTmax the corresponding values were 0. 626, 0. 667, 0. 698, and 0. 716  mm. CIMTmean and CIMTmax increased significantly for increasing DR steps (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). The relative change in CIMTmean and CIMTmax were largest between 40 and 55  dB (6. 7 % and 7. 0 %) and smallest between 70 and 85  dB (2. 6 % and 2. 7 %) indicating a declining dependency for increasing DR. Conclusions DR significantly changes CIMT measurements and the changes are most prominent for lower DRs. The effect of changing DR is larger in human arteries than in phantoms. Reporting the DR will therefore increase the validity of CIMT data...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} whether myocardial contrast echocardiography is quantitatively reproducible, repeated intracoronary injections of sonicated albumin (5 %) were performed in eight open chest dogs. Paired injections were performed at baseline, during ischemia produced by ligation of a coronary artery, and during hyperemia induced by intravenous infusion of 0. 75 mg/kg body weight of dipyridamole. Contrast washout curves were generated {{for the left}} anterior descending coronary artery territory (ischemic area) and left circumflex coronary artery territory (nonischemic area) by beat per beat analysis of <b>frozen</b> end-diastolic <b>frames</b> of left ventricular short-axis views. Peak contrast intensity, contrast washout half-time and area under the curve were derived from these curves. A total of 75 contrast washout curves were analyzed {{for the study of}} interinjection, intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility. The correlation coefficients between measurements obtained from paired injections of the echocardiographic contrast agent (interinjection reproducibility) ranged from 0. 78 for peak contrast intensity to 0. 87 for area under the curve. Percent error varied between 14. 7 % and 24. 7 %. The intraobserver variability in measurements was less than the interinjection variability, with a cumulative mean percent error of 17. 8 % and correlation coefficients of 0. 72 (peak contrast intensity), 0. 95 (area under the curve) and 0. 96 (washout half-time). Interobserver correlation for all indexes was high (r = 0. 92 to 0. 96). It is concluded that peak contrast intensity, contrast washout half-time and the area under the curve derived from myocardial contrast washout curves can be measured reproducibly from videotapes. In addition, the variability between two injections attempted under identical conditions is greater than reader variability from videotapes...|$|R
40|$|Myocardial {{opacification}} after {{intravenous injection}} of an echo-contrast agent {{is a major}} end point in contrast echocardiography, {{but it has not}} yet been obtained in human beings. We propose transesophageal contrast echocardiography as a clinical tool for the study of myocardial perfusion in human beings. Sonicated albumin microbubbles are bright ultrasound reflectors that cross the pulmonary vasculature after intravenous injection and show physiologic transit times through tissues. Transesophageal echocardiography uses ideal transducer frequency and acoustic window for in vivo detection of sonicated albumin microbubbles. We have studied 11 patients receiving peripheral vein bolus injection of sonicated albumin microbubbles during transesophageal echocardiography at baseline and during dipyridamole infusion. Images were recorded on videotape and digitized off-line. Quantitative measurements were made on 11 normally perfused myocardial segments by tracing a region of interest of greater than 100 pixels on <b>frozen</b> end-systolic <b>frames,</b> at baseline, and during dipyridamole infusion. Transpulmonary passage with full left ventricular cavity opacification was obtained in all injections. In 8 of 22 injections there was also transient left ventricular cavity attenuation. In all patients there was a marked opacification of the left ventricular outflow tract and aortic root. At baseline, mean signal intensity in the myocardium increased from 80 +/- 37 to 117 +/- 49 IU (p < 0. 05) and during dipyridamole infusion increased from 84 +/- 28 to 146 +/- 36 IU (p < 0. 001). The analysis of background-subtracted data showed that mean pixel intensity increased from baseline to dipyridamole contrast injection (from 37 +/- 15 to 62 +/- 19 IU; p < 0. 01). The opacification of normally perfused left ventricular myocardium is feasible during transesophageal echocardiography because there is a significant increase in signal intensity versus background intensity. During dipyridamole infusion there is a further increase in signal intensity that probably reflects pharmacologically induced increase in myocardial blood flow...|$|R
40|$|This site {{specific}} sculpture {{was commissioned}} as a Collateral Project {{as part of}} the 2014 Kochi-Muziris Biennale in Fort Kochi, feral, India. Shown in a public space outside the RDO Office in Fort Kochi between January and March 2015. Concept Note: The Ambassador car from the late 1940 ’s became a symbol of India’s independence from a British colonial past, a legacy of a Nehruvian modernizing agenda and a closed economy, only to become a victim of recent economic reforms rendering it suddenly into a curio of this recent past. In May 2014 the maker of India’s Ambassador car have suspended production. The sculptural artwork is the photographic recording of an abandoned and wrecked Ambassador car found in Delhi in 2012, that is literally ‘returned’ by D’Souza from decline into an object made whole again. This resurrection is achieved by rendering his original photographs into a three dimensional photographic shroud of this deceased vehicle while also capturing the external multiple viewpoints and <b>frozen</b> moments <b>framed</b> as multiple views of India. The car acts as a lens capturing a rupture in the world its cubist appearance also recognises the multiple viewpoints where ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ vie together to make sense of each other and where each vantage point struggles to inhabit a space of the original object. The sculpture here in the Biennale is positioned in a parking bay on a busy street thus returning it as an object into what on first appearances would be it’s natural home, making it’s reading as a sculpture more ambiguous and challenging in the public sphere. The sculpture not only becomes a form of documentary of an object but absorbs issues of boundaries and space within the political and social complexity of territory in the city also videnced by the graffiti tags on the car of the Delhi based street artist Daku (whose pseudonym is a colloquial expression for ‘bandit’). The abstraction from the original object not only becomes a meditation on the complexity of change and identity in contemporary urban India, but also through the title becomes a clear reminder of a historic and colonial past rendered impotent through recent historic change. A Chapter titled 'End of Empire' in the publication 'India's Biennale Effect: A Politics of Contemporary Art', (180 - 207) locates the critical practices and strategies in the making and installation of this artwork in Fort Kochi by examining models and critiques around participatory modes of artist engagement with locality through social/community practices...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} problem of how {{information}} contained in multiple, short exposure images of the same scene taken through (and distorted by) a turbulent medium (turbulent atmosphere or moving water surface) may be extracted and combined to produce a single image with superior quality and higher resolution. This problem is generally termed image restoration. It has many applications in fields as diverse as remote sensing, military intelligence, surveillance and recognition at a long distance, and other imaging problems which suffer from turbulent media, including e. g. the atmosphere and moving water surface. Wide-area/near-to-ground imaging (through atmosphere) and water imaging are the two main focuses of this thesis. The central technique used to solve these problems is speckle imaging, which is used to process a large number of images of the object with short exposure times such that the turbulent effect is <b>frozen</b> in each <b>frame.</b> A robust and efficient method using the bispectrum is developed to recover an almost diffraction-limited sharp image using the information contained in the captured short exposure images. Both the accuracy and the potential of these new algorithms have been investigated. Motivated by the lucky imaging technique which was used to select superior frames for astronomical imaging application, a new and more efficient technique is proposed. This technique is called lucky region, and it is aimed at selecting image regions with high quality as opposed to selecting a whole image as a lucky image. A new algorithm using bicoherence is proposed for lucky region selection. Its performance, as well as practical factors that may affect the performance, are investigated both theoretically and empirically. To further improve the quality of the recovered clean image after the speckle bispectrum processing, we also investigate blind deconvolution. One of the original contributions is to use natural image sparsity as a prior knowledge for the turbulence image restoration problem. A new algorithm is proposed and its performance is validated experimentally. The new methods are extended to the case of water imaging: restoration of images distorted by moving water waves. It is shown that this problem can be effectively solved by techniques developed in this thesis. Possible practical applications include various forms of ocean observation...|$|R
40|$|Ankara : Türk Edebiyatı Bölümü, Bilkent Üniversity 2010. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2010. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 144 - 147. Poet and prose writer Ahmet Hâşim (1884 - 1933), {{a unique}} contributor to Modern Turkish Literature, penned down various great works. Although {{significant amount of}} scholarly research {{in the form of}} memoir and survey has been conducted on his life and unconventional individuality, little work has been done on his poetry. The works of Hâşim are usually associated with symbolism and impressionism. Indeed, most of the work done on his poetry also limit themselves with a similar deduction that his poems are either “symbolist” or “impressionist”. The lack of any profound analysis on how these two movements affected Hâşim’s poetry in the realm of language or what were their contributions to the content in terms of themes has led to a critical blockage. Although in his works he explains his poetics as “poems composed not to be understood but to be heard”, he has still succeeded to preserve his place in the realm of literary criticism as the composer of inconceivable poems. This work aims at analysing the matter of Time in Hâşim’s poetry and attempts to argue what has not been argued so far. It can be considered as a new step {{in the context of the}} interpretation of Hâşim’s poetry. Depending on the effects of symbolism and impressionism, two distinct concepts of time prevail in the poetry of Ahmet Hâşim. In symbolist poems the understanding of time is subjective, synchronic and immeasurable whereas in impressionist poems it is objective, measurable and progressive. In symbolist poems, through uncompleted meanings and a wide range of connotations of symbols, “Cyclical Time” is referred. Thus, the theoretical background of the thesis entails some explanation on the key concepts of Bergson’s philosophy of time such as “Durée” and “Memory”. In impressionist poems it can be observed that there are certain sections in which linear time is attempted to be <b>frozen</b> in one <b>frame</b> through the depiction of images and a cinematographic narration. Image as a visual element is a component in these poems with the notion of linear time. The place of image in language plane and its effect on the composition of themes will be analyzed in the context of time. Kocabay, HaticeM. S...|$|R
