50|$|Viscoplasticity is {{a theory}} in {{continuum}} mechanics that describes the rate-dependent <b>inelastic</b> <b>behavior</b> of solids.

The <b>inelastic</b> <b>behavior</b> {{that is the subject of}} viscoplasticity is plastic deformation which means that the material undergoes unrecoverable deformations when a load level is reached. Rate-dependent plasticity is important for transient plasticity calculations. The main difference between rate-independent plastic and viscoplastic material models is that the latter exhibit not only permanent deformations after the application of loads but continue to undergo a creep flow as a function of time under the influence of the applied load.|$|E

50|$|Design {{of mining}} and civil {{structures}} in rock typically involves a failure criterion that is cohesive-frictional. The failure criterion {{is used to}} determine whether a state of stress in the rock will lead to <b>inelastic</b> <b>behavior,</b> including brittle failure. For rocks under high hydrostatic stresses, brittle failure is preceded by plastic deformation and the failure criterion is used to determine the onset of plastic deformation. Typically, perfect plasticity is assumed beyond the yield point. However strain hardening and softening relations with nonlocal inelasticity and damage have also been used. Failure criteria and yield surfaces are also often augmented with a cap to avoid unphysical situations where extreme hydrostatic stress states do not lead to failure or plastic deformation.|$|E

30|$|Anisotropy of <b>inelastic</b> <b>behaviors,</b> or {{in a more}} broad sense, the {{dependence}} of <b>inelastic</b> <b>behaviors</b> {{on the type of}} loading and direction is common for many high-temperature materials (Naumenko and Altenbach 2016). Important features of plastic anisotropy and asymmetry can be related to different length scales, like grain/subgrain scale, phase/lamellar scale, crystal lattice scale, dislocations and atomic scales, etc. Privileged crystallographic orientation or texture development can be associated with grain scale. Similarly many other origins of the anisotropy like defects inclusions-cavities in metals and multiphase alloys, directional distribution of a particular phase, anisotropy of individual grains, etc., can be related to different scale dependent phenomena. In order to understand different macroscopic behaviors including the plastic anisotropy and asymmetry in Ti-Al alloys, it is necessary to understand their origins at the lower length scales. Regular misfit dislocations along the lamellar interfaces, formation of faulted dipoles of superdislocations, changes in deformation modes due to the appearance of some superstructures, domination of climb at high temperature, etc., for the Al-rich TiAl family are few of them at the smaller scales. Various macroscopic behaviors of this family, like anomalous yielding and hardening, recovery, increasing brittleness with the increase of Al-content, etc. are also deserved to be investigated in order to understand different inelastic phenomena. This knowledge is in turn instrumental {{to the understanding of the}} mechanisms responsible for the anomalous behavior, plastic anisotropy and tension compression asymmetry, etc. (Gregori and Veyssiere 2000). In general, it is believed that the plastic behaviors in Al-rich TiAl alloys depend on the formation of superstructural phases and the activated slip systems varied (Nakano et al. 1999).|$|R
30|$|However, in many cases, when {{addressing}} complex coupled physics, <b>inelastic</b> <b>behaviors</b> or {{any other}} exhibiting localization, the validity of hypotheses able to reduce models from 3 D to 2 D becomes doubtful and consequently {{in order to ensure}} accurate results 3 D discretizations seem compulsory. However mesh-based solutions of models defined in such degenerated domains is a challenging issue because the resulting meshes usually involve too many degrees of freedom, where the mesh size is almost determined by the domain thickness and the material and/or solution details to be represented. In order to alleviate the associated computational complexity in [3] authors proposed computing the fully 3 D solution employing an in-plane-out-of-plane separated representation whose computational complexity remains the one characteristic of 2 D plate or shell simulations, using the proper generalized decomposition-PGD-method [4].|$|R

30|$|Most of {{mechanical}} systems and complex structures exhibit plate and shell components. Therefore, 2 D simulation, based on plate and shell theory, appears as an appealing choice in structural analysis as it allows reducing the computational complexity. Nevertheless, this 2 D framework fails for capturing rich physics compromising the usual hypotheses considered when deriving standard plate and shell theories. To circumvent, {{or at least}} alleviate this issue, authors proposed in their former works an in-plane-out-of-plane separated representation able to capture rich 3 D behaviors while keeping the computational complexity of 2 D simulations. However, that procedure it was revealed to be too intrusive for being introduced into existing commercial softwares. Moreover, experience indicated that such enriched descriptions are only compulsory locally, in some regions or structure components. In the present paper we propose an enrichment procedure able to address 3 D local behaviors, preserving the direct minimally-invasive coupling with existing plate and shell discretizations. The proposed strategy will be extended to <b>inelastic</b> <b>behaviors</b> and structural dynamics.|$|R

Moreover, the deforma-tion may depend {{on the history of}} applied forces. The present paper proposes inelastically deformable models for use in computer graphics animation. These dynamic mod-els tractably simulate three canonical <b>inelastic</b> <b>behaviors</b> [...] viscoelasticity, plasticity, and fracture. Viscous and plastic processes within the models evolve a reference component, which describes the natural shape, according to yield and creep relationships that depend on applied force and/or in-stantaneous deformation.

40|$|The <b>inelastic</b> <b>behavior</b> and {{ultimate}} load capacity of individual steel beams and beam columns {{has been extensively}} studied {{in the last two}} decades. However, the advanced inelastic analysis of partially restrained planar steel frames has been limited to small scale structures. In addition, analytic models for structural members commonly utilize concentrated plasticity and interaction surfaces to simulate <b>inelastic</b> <b>behavior</b> of the members in lieu of the more realistic spread of plasticity model. Furthermore, advanced analysis of large planar steel frames has not been attempted due to limitations in computer memory and speed. Advances in computational technology, mainly the advent of vector and parallel processing and nonlinear solution techniques, has allowed problems of unprecedented size and complexity to be solved successfully in various areas of science and engineering. Many limitations to the types of analysis and size of structures analyzed no longer exist.
