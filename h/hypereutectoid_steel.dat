The {{relationship}} between mechanical properties and pearlite microstructure was investigated using various heat treatments on a <b>hypereutectoid</b> <b>steels</b> containing 1 % carbon with {{different levels of}} vanadium and silicon. Specimens were heat treated at various temperatures ranging from 900 to 1200 °C and transferred to salt bath conditions at 550, 580 and 620 °C to examine the structural evolution of pearlite. The {{results show that the}} thickness of the cementite network increases with increasing reheat temperature. This is likely due to the larger austenite grain size reducing the grain boundary area available for proeutectoid cementite nucleation.

5000|$|The {{purpose of}} heat {{treating}} carbon steel {{is to change}} the mechanical properties of steel, usually ductility, hardness, yield strength, or impact resistance. Note that the electrical and thermal conductivity are only slightly altered. As with most strengthening techniques for steel, Young's modulus (elasticity) is unaffected. All treatments of steel trade ductility for increased strength and vice versa. Iron has a higher solubility for carbon in the austenite phase; therefore all heat treatments, except spheroidizing and process annealing, start by heating the steel to a temperature at which the austenitic phase can exist. The steel is then quenched (heat drawn out) at a moderate to low rate allowing carbon to diffuse out of the austenite forming iron-carbide (cementite) to precipitate leaving ferrite, or at a high rate, trapping the carbon within the iron thus forming martensite. The rate at which the steel is cooled through the eutectoid temperature (about 727°C) affects the rate at which carbon diffuses out of austenite and forms cementite. Generally speaking, cooling swiftly will leave iron carbide finely dispersed and produce a fine grained pearlite and cooling slowly will give a coarser pearlite. Cooling a hypoeutectoid steel (less than 0.77 wt% C) results in a lamellar-pearlitic structure of iron carbide layers with α-ferrite (nearly pure iron) between. If it is <b>hypereutectoid</b> <b>steel</b> (more than 0.77 wt% C) then the structure is full pearlite with small grains (larger than the pearlite lamella) of cementite formed on the grain boundaries. A eutectoid steel (0.77% carbon) will have a pearlite structure throughout the grains with no cementite at the boundaries. The relative amounts of constituents are found using the lever rule. The following is a list of the types of heat treatments possible: ...|$|E

40|$|The rate {{controlling}} {{mechanism for}} pearlite growth in a <b>hypereutectoid</b> <b>steel</b> composition was examined through {{an analysis of}} the microstructural characteristics of the pearlite structure, namely interlamellar spacing, for different isothermal transformation and austenitising conditions.

Through the application and experimental validation of a theoretical model (Zener and Hillert) for the calculation of the pearlite interlamellar spacing as a function of the undercooling, the growth rate of pearlite in the <b>hypereutectoid</b> <b>steel</b> was determined to be controlled by the volume diffusion of carbon in austenite during isothermal transformation in the temperature range of 5502 ̆ 0136200 C.

40|$|Eutectoid and <b>hypereutectoid</b> <b>steels</b> are {{extensively}} {{used for}} different engineering applications, because {{they offer a}} useful combination of strength and ductility as well as good corrosion resistance, wear resistance and machinability. In these steels, the major microstructural microconstituent is pearlite. However, depending on the chemical composition of the austenite prior to transformation and the thermal path during the decomposition of austenite, i. e., rate of cooling to the transformation temperature, the formation of proeutectoid cementite along the prior-austenite grain boundaries might take place. The presence of proeutectoid cementite along the austenite grain boundaries has a deleterious effect on the final mechanical properties of these fully pearlitic steels. Thermomechanical processing studies on <b>hypereutectoid</b> <b>steels</b> {{have shown that the}} composition and microstructural conditions of austenite prior to transformation to a fully pearlitic microstructure has a strong effect on reducing the formation of proeutectoid cementite along the austenite grain boundaries as well as the refinement of the interlamellar spacing.

50|$|The {{eutectoid}} {{composition of}} austenite is approximately 0.76% carbon; steel with less carbon content (hypoeutectoid steel) will contain a corresponding proportion of relatively pure ferrite crystallites {{that do not}} participate in the eutectoid reaction and cannot transform into pearlite. Likewise steels with higher carbon content (<b>hypereutectoid</b> <b>steels)</b> will form cementite before reaching the eutectoid point. The proportion of ferrite and cementite forming above the eutectoid point can be calculated from the iron/iron—carbide equilibrium phase diagram using the lever rule.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{morphological}} features of pearlite were revealed through {{scanning electron microscopy}} using deeply etched specimens. These include cementite branching, bridging, gaps, holes and curvature. The presence of cementite thin films or networks along the austenite grain boundaries in eutectoid steel and at the interface between pearlite and proeutectoid ferrite in hypoeutectoid steel is another characteristic of pearlite. Further-more, ferrite thin films surrounding the proeutectoid cementite in <b>hypereutectoid</b> <b>steels</b> are also observed. Hence, it is considered that in hypoeutectoid steels the nucleus for pearlite is a film of cementite rather than the expected proeutectoid ferrite and, similarly, in <b>hypereutectoid</b> <b>steels</b> pearlite forms from a ferrite film rather than from proeutectoid cementite. Convergent beam Kikuchi line diffraction was used to accurately determine the orientation relationships between pearlitic constituents and parent austenite in a Hadfields steel. The results show that neither the pearlitic ferrite nor the cementite is crystallographically related to the austenite grain into which the pearlite was growing and to that into which it was not growing. in addition, a new orientation relationship between pearlitic cementite and ferrite in the Hadfield steel was also observed.

The harder, fast-cooled samples displayed less plastic flow at the surface than the softer slow-cooled ones. With regard to chemical composition, silicon was found to strengthen the ferrite thus reducing strain incompatibilities with the cementite, preventing in this way the fragmentation and eventual dissolution of the lamellae. This is beneficial since larger depths of cementite dissolution were found in samples with lower cycles to crack initiation for a given cooling rate (hardness).

40|$|The {{eutectoid}} transformation of austenite can occur cooperatively (pearlite transformation) or {{by means of}} a non-cooperative mode (Divorced Eutectoid Transformation).
