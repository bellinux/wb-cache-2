5|$|In orbit, the {{undermanned}} Enterprise is {{attacked and}} disabled by Kruge. In the standoff that follows, Kruge orders {{that one of}} the hostages on the surface be executed. Marcus is killed defending Saavik and Spock. <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> company feign surrender and activate the Enterprises self-destruct sequence, killing the Klingon boarding party while the Enterprise crew transports to the planet's surface. Promising the secret of Genesis, Kirk lures Kruge to the planet and has him beam his crew to the Klingon vessel. As the Genesis planet disintegrates, <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Kruge engage in a fistfight; Kirk emerges victorious after kicking Kruge off a cliff into a lava flow. <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> his officers take control of the Klingon ship and head to Vulcan.|$|E
5|$|Romulan agents {{board the}} ShiKahr and capture Kirk. Spock agrees to their demands and travels with them. Whilst en route, Spock enters pon farr and finds {{that he is}} linked to Kirk, but mates with the Romulan Thea {{to allow it to}} pass. They {{retrieve}} <b>Kirk,</b> <b>and</b> discover that taking <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Spock was a ploy to have them both travel back in time to stop the Romulan agents from preventing the formation of the Federation. They travel back in time and disable the agents, but Spock is seriously injured and dying. <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Spock mindmeld as reality shifts once more and restores the original timeline.|$|E
5|$|In 2259, Enterprise {{receives}} a distress {{call from a}} space station harvesting {{the power of a}} binary star. There is too much interference to beam the crew aboard, so <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Spock (voiced by Zachary Quinto) take a shuttle to rescue the crew. They encounter T'Mar, a childhood friend of Spock, who explains they were gathering energy to power the Helios device, which would speed up the terraforming of New Vulcan; the team inadvertently opened a rip in the fabric of space. Beaming to New Vulcan, <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Spock meet with T'Mar's father Surok, who explains the station's power from the base was lost after they were attacked by creatures—who call themselves the Gorn— from the rip. The Gorn infect some of the crew with a virus that makes them aggressive. <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Spock enter the locked down sections of the base to recover the infected survivors, but are unable to stop the Gorn from stealing the Helios device and kidnapping Surok.|$|E

Now, We recall that definitions of asymptotic center and asymptotic radius.|$|R
5|$|Kirk {{resolves}} {{to enter}} the Rip. After Enterprise enters the Gorn's galaxy, <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Spock take a shuttle with Sulu (voiced by John Cho) and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) to a nearby planet. When their shuttle is shot down, <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Spock use wingsuits to glide to a Gorn outpost and blow it up before infiltrating a base to rescue T'Mar. They find Daniels, who is killed in an ensuing firefight. The Gorn bring <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Spock to the Commander, who has them taken to an arena to fight his soldiers to the death. Angered by their besting of his champion, the Commander has Spock infected with the virus and pits him against Kirk. Sulu's shuttle arrives and McCoy shoots Spock with an antidote, while the Commander flees to his ship with T'Mar and the device.|$|E
5|$|The shuttle {{returns to}} Enterprise, {{which has been}} taken over by the Gorn. <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Spock space dive to {{engineering}} and beam McCoy and Sulu back on board. They help Scotty (voiced by Simon Pegg) and Keenser reactivate the warp core, and restore power to sickbay so McCoy can replicate more of the antidote for airborne dispersal. The duo head to the bridge where the Henchman is holding Uhura (voiced by Zoe Saldana) hostage, demanding Kirk give them control of the ship. Kirk responds by directing their shuttle to crash into the view-screen, decompressing the Gorn into space. With only an hour before the Rip closes, <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Spock space dive to the Gorn Commander's ship, where they disable the targeting platform to give Enterprise a fighting chance, and enter the core where T'Mar and the device are being held. <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Spock destroy the device, defeat the Commander, and are beamed back to Enterprise with T'Mar. Enterprise warps back to the Milky Way Galaxy before the Rip closes; in their closing logs, <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Spock state T'Mar has recovered enough to continue working on New Vulcan, and that they have been ordered to Nibiru.|$|E

Anne had been brought up a Lutheran, but she may have discreetly converted to Catholicism at some point, a politically embarrassing scenario which alarmed ministers of the Scottish <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> caused suspicion in Anglican England.|$|E

5|$|The 19th century also {{witnessed}} {{two major}} restorations to St Denys'. As the congregation expanded, {{the need for}} greater space was met {{with the addition of}} a new north aisle in 1853. This coincided with a wider restoration project carried out at the cost of £3,500 by <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Parry, which included the demolition of the galleries, the addition of a strainer arch and the relocation of the organ. The church was damaged by an electrical storm in 1884 and parts, including the stone broach spire—one of the oldest in England—were rebuilt by <b>Kirk</b> <b>and</b> Parry in 1885–86. The old organ was sold in 1891 and St Hugh's Chapel and the choir vestry were dedicated to the memory of a local solicitor, Henry Snow, in 1906. Electric lighting was introduced in 1951–53 and extensive restoration work was carried out in 1966, when the organ was rebuilt, and in 1988. Fifty-four solar panels were added in 2008, at the cost of £70,000, and by 2011 were able to cover the church's electricity bill.|$|E

5|$|At one time, three churches {{stood on}} Hirta. Christ Church, in {{the site of}} the {{graveyard}} at the centre of the village, was in use in 1697 and was the largest, but this thatched-roof structure was too small to hold the entire population, and most of the congregation had to gather in the churchyard during services. St Brendan's Church lay over a kilometre away on the slopes of Ruival, and St Columba's at the west end of the village street, but little is left of these buildings. A new <b>kirk</b> <b>and</b> manse were erected at the east end of the village in 1830 and a Factor's house in 1860.|$|E
