So they decided to introduce a simulated version instead. This would comprise a very ordinary 700 type instrument, with a push button mod. kit fitted.

40|$|Second economy {{people in}} {{developing}} countries are people living in communities that are underserved in terms of basic amenities and social services. Due to literacy challenges and user accessibility problems in rural communities, {{it is often difficult}} to design user interfaces that conform to the capabilities and cultural experiences of low-literacy rural community users. Rural community users are technologically illiterate and lack the knowledge of the potential of information and communication technologies. In order to embrace new technology, users will need to perceive the user interface and application as useful and easy to interact with. This requires proper understanding of the users and their socio-cultural environment. This will enable the interfaces and interactions to conform to their behaviours, motivations as well as cultural experiences and preferences and thus enhance usability and user experience. Mobile phones have the potential to increase access to information and provide a platform for economic development in rural communities. Rural communities have economic potential in terms of agriculture and micro-enterprises. Information technology can be used to enhance socio-economic activities and improve rural livelihood. We conducted a study to design user interfaces for a mobile commerce application for micro-entrepreneurs in a rural community in South Africa. The aim of the study was to design mobile interfaces and interaction techniques that are easy to use and meet the cultural preferences and experiences of users who have little to no previous experience of mobile commerce technology. And also to explore the potentials of information technologies rural community users, and bring mobile added value services to rural micro-entrepreneurs. We applied a user-centred design approach in Dwesa community and used qualitative and quantitative research methods to collect data for the design of the user interfaces (graphic user interface and voice user interface) and mobile commerce application. We identified and used several interface elements to design and finally evaluate the graphical user interface. The statistics analysis of the evaluation results show that the users in the community have positive perception of the usefulness of the application, the ease of use and intention to use the application. Community users with no prior experience with this technology were able to learn and understand the interface, recorded minimum errors and a high level of v precision during task performance when they interacted with the shop-owner graphic user interface. The voice user interface designed in this study consists of two flavours (<b>dual</b> <b>tone</b> <b>multi-frequency</b> input and voice input) for rural users. The evaluation results show that community users recorded higher tasks successes and minimum errors with the <b>dual</b> <b>tone</b> <b>multi-frequency</b> input interface than the voice only input interface. Also, a higher percentage of users prefer the <b>dual</b> <b>tone</b> <b>multi-frequency</b> input interface. The t-Test statistical analysis performed on the tasks completion times and error rate show that there was significant statistical difference between the <b>dual</b> <b>tone</b> <b>multi-frequency</b> input interface and the voice input interface. The interfaces were easy to learn, understand and use. Properly designed user interfaces that meet the experience and capabilities of low-literacy users in rural areas will improve usability and users‟ experiences. Adaptation of interfaces to users‟ culture and preferences will enhance information services accessibility among different user groups in different regions. This will promote technology acceptance in rural communities for socio-economic benefits. The user interfaces presented in this study can be adapted to different cultures to provide similar services for marginalised communities in developing countrie...|$|E

In this work, telephone signalling technique using <b>Dual</b> <b>Tone</b> <b>Multi-Frequency</b> (DTMF) signalling, is used to control switching of electrical loads such as agricultural pumps located in remote areas. A DTMF tone command sent from a transmitting fixed or mobile phone terminal will be used to SWITCH ON/OFF the motors used to pump water for agricultural fields. A processing electronic system at the receiving side is designed to interpret the tone commands and sends an appropriate signal to the motor driving circuit to complete the pump switching states. In the design methodology, it is possible to control several water pumps distributed in a certain agricultural site, however, in this work we considered four pumps and the paper presents the complete electronic design and simulation results at the different stages of the design. The electronic design is based on discrete passive and active electronic components and the system is tested and simulated using Multism program. The results of the simulation show that the design is capable of controlling the switching state of the motors. For a certain DTMF command, it is possible to switch ON/OFF a specific motor pump or all of the four motors...|$|E
40|$|Now-a-days, {{a lot of}} {{research}} is being carried out in the development of USVs (Unmanned surface vehicles), UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) etc. Now in case of USVs generally, we have seen that wireless controlled vehicles use RF circuits which suffer from many drawbacks such as limited working range, limited frequency range and limited control. Moreover shooting infrared outdoors on a bright sunny day is often problematic, since sunlight can interfere with the infrared signal. Use of a GSM network (in the form of a mobile phone, a cordless phone) for robotic control can overcome these limitations. It provides the advantages of robust control, working range as large as the coverage area of the service provider in comparison with that of an IR system, no interference with other controllers.

The telephone user can access the information from anywhere at anytime simply by dialing a specified number and following an on-line instruction when a connection has been established.

The input may be given by means of touch-tone or <b>Dual</b> <b>Tone</b> <b>Multi-Frequency</b> (DTMF) signal, which is generated when a caller presses a key of his/her telephone set, and the sequence of messages to be played is determined dynamically according to an internal menu structure (maintained within the IVR application program) and the user input. The IVRS system which will be designed will provide an ideal platform for the operation of start-ups and existing small concerns.

40|$|A popular {{application}} {{that runs on}} a Voice-over-IP network is the Interactive Voice Response (IVR), which provides a way for interacting with an end user's phone via a telephony interface by presenting a set of audible menu options, and collecting the user's <b>Dual</b> <b>Tone</b> <b>Multi-Frequency</b> responses as the user presses the telephone numeric keypad, and recording the user's voice. This thesis takes a closer look into IVR systems on an IP-based network, specifically in networks that support the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for controlling the telephony signalling, and more specifically on IVR systems that have their SIP signalling controlled by a SIP Application Server (SIPAS) implementing the SipServlet 1. 0 or 1. 1 specifications and where a SIP-based Media Server is used to stream IVR media to the end-user. We describe existing ways for supporting an IVR development in a SIP network, and then we propose an alternative way of accomplishing the same task: the IVRObject. With the help of prototypes, the IVRObject is compared with the existing {{state of the art}} against three criteria: (a) {{how easy it is to}} develop, (b) how portable the development solution is, (c) and how scalable the solution is in order to sustain a high call volume. As a conclusion, it will be highlighted that the IVRObject provides an easy mechanism for development of IVR-based applications running on a SIPAS, that it is portable to different media server vendors, and that it supports a test strategy that can be leveraged to improve software development quality and faster development. This makes the IVRObject a good alternative especially for enterprise-based IVR applications where scalability is less of an issue than in carrier-space applications...|$|E
