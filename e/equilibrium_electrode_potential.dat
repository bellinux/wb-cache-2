The counter-electrode material influences the counter-electrode processes at the CE/insulator interface and consequently determines the metal ion concentration in the cells. We measured the switching kinetics for SiO 2 /Ag based ECM cells using different counter-electrode materials with different electrocatalytic activities towards water reduction, namely platinum, ruthenium, and iridium oxide, as well as titanium nitride and tantalum.

However, when the diffusion rate of Cu 2 + ions is lower than the charge supply rate, the deposited Cu 2 O is actively converted into Cu through Eq.  2 instead of insufficient Cu 2 + ions. Under this condition, the deposition of the Cu 2 O is controlled through the diffusion of the Cu 2 + ions. Moreover, Cu 2 O deposition is concentrated {{at the top of the}} electrodeposited structure with a short diffusion distance.|$|E

The analysis for the simplest case which accounts for only diffusion transport of the reacting substances from one electrode to another has been made. The simple relation for thermodynamic efficiency of such energy sources was obtained. The diffusion-migration transport for the horizontally arranged cell and the diffusion-convection transport for the vertically arranged cell were studied in detail. The original mathematical methods for solving transport equations were used. Analytical results for the concentration distribution and the current-voltage curves were calculated. The principal role of electrode kinetics (fast changing of the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>electrode</b> <b>potential</b> with the temperature) was shown. Finally, the general algorithm for improving thermogalvanic cells was proposed. Key words: diffusion-migration transport, fluid motion, efficiency concentration distribution, current-voltage curve.

40|$|The {{availability}} of structurally homogeneous ortho-rhombic YBa 2 Cu 3 OT-x single crystals {{is crucial for}} the suc-cessful characterization f the anisotropic physical behav-ior of this high Tc superconductor. Experiments on polycrystalline samples cannot characterize the orienta-tional dependence ofphysical properties such as electrical conductivity, phonon spectrum, and band structure. Solid-state grain coarsening and flux growth methods {{have been used to}} produce YBa 2 Cu 3 OT- = single crystals (1 - 6). As grain coarsening produces very small single crys-tals, more research effort has been dedicated to flux growth methods. Most previous attempts at YBa 2 Cu 3 OT-. ~ single-crystal flux growths have yielded oxygen deficient, sometimes tetragonal single crystals with low super-conducting volume fractions (4). Attempts to raise the oxy-gen content of the single crystals by oxygen annealing are hampered by low oxygen diffusivity in the crystals and mi-crocracking from the strain induced by the orthorhombic to tetragonal transformation. The low oxygen content of these single crystals is not surprising, as they are usually grown from melts containing excess cupric oxide at tem-peratures above 850 ~ It is likely that crystals nucleated and grown beneath the melt surface experience an envi-ronment of very low oxygen partial pressure because the melt will probably not be at equilibrium with the atmos-phere. The elevation of the oxygen activity in the crystal growth medium is a promising method of directly produc-ing orthorhombic single crystals. We have achieved this by electrochemical transport of oxygen into the melts using an inert yttria-stabilized-zirconia solid electrolyte.

40|$|Manganese oxide, MnO 2, excels as {{a hybrid}} {{electrical}} energy storage material. The man- ganese centers in MnO 2 {{are capable of}} undergoing a reduction from 4 + to 3 + balanced by the intercalation of lithium ions to form LixMnO 2 while its conductive surfaces simultaneously store energy as an electrical double layer capacitor. Additionally, MnO 2 nanowire structure for batteries and super-capacitors can produce superior power relative to films of the same materials. These advantages make MnO 2 promising candidate for electrical energy storage material. But the Achilles Heel of nanowires is their susceptibility to degradation and failure. Typically such MnO 2 nanowires are attached to a current collector at just one end and electrical conductivity of the nanowire therefore plays a very important role. In this work, the electrical conductance of δ-MnO 2 nanowires is directly measured in-situ in 1 M LiClO 4, acetonitrile {{as a function of}} the equilibrium Li content for nanowires with varying lateral dimensions. As the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>electrode</b> <b>potential</b> is decreased from 0. 60 V to - 0. 80 V and lithium is intercalated, the electrical conductivity of MnO 2 nanowires increases by up to one order of magnitude. The measured change in conductivity is also dependent on the width of nanowires. After doping at - 0. 80 V vs. MSE, the conductivity increases by 30 % for an 870 nm wide nanowire array and 880 % for a 275 nm wide array. Additionally, the combination of poly (methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) to the propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte is discovered to eliminate the degradation processes in MnO 2 nanowire capacitors. The nanowires investigated here have a Au@ δ-MnO 2, core@shell, architecture in which a central gold nanowire current collector is surrounded by an electrodeposited layer of δ- MnO 2. In the liquid PC electrolyte, the identical δ-MnO 2 capacitors fractures, delaminates, and separates from the gold nanowire current collector. The addition of PMMA to the PC electrolyte prevents these deleterious processes and extends cycle stability to 100, 000 cycles and beyond. This is shown through reversible cycle stability up to 200, 000 cycles with 96 % average coulombic efficiency for symmetrical δ-MnO 2 nanowire capacitors operating across 1. 2 V– 1. 8 V voltage windows in a PMMA gel electrolyte...|$|E
