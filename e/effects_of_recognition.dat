40|$|Whilst {{few would}} dispute the motivational power of {{recognising}} exceptional {{performance in the}} workplace, it is unusual for texts on reward management to feature a chapter focusing solely on employee recognition schemes, separate from the related constructs of non-financial reward and total reward. There exists a sense of ambiguity around the concept of employee recognition – its meaning, constitution and role – which {{is reflected in the}} lack of scholarly research or theory development in this area, compared to other components of the reward system. This chapter is intended to extend thinking and practice around employee recognition and its management through detailed and focused consideration of its distinctive characteristics and role within contemporary organisations. In so doing, the chapter aims to stimulate empirical research into this increasingly widespread but under-explored area of reward management. Research which shows the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> on employees’ engagement and well-being, motivation and performance is balanced against evidence that employee recognition may have unintended dysfunctional consequences. Whilst acknowledging the traditional theoretical foundation of needs-based motivation and reinforcement theory, there is a consideration of social exchange theory as an alternative lens through which to view the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> on individuals and organisations. The chapter concludes by offering practical advice on the effective design and management of programmes for recognising employee performance...|$|E

40|$|A widely-cited study {{investigating}} <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> difficulty on the phonetic {{realization of}} words (Wright, 1997, 2004) described vowel dispersion in {{a subset of}} the Easy/Hard database (Torretta, 1995). The core finding was that vowel dispersion, i. e. distance {{from the center of the}} talker’s F 1 /F 2 space, was greater in words that represent difficult recognition targets, due to competition from other words in the lexicon (‘hard ’ words) than in easy recognition targets (‘easy ’ words). The goal of the current study was to test whether the pattern observed in the subset extended to a larger portion of the Easy/Hard database, and whether the effect persisted when controlling for known other determinants of vowel dispersion. Extending the investigation to all monophthongs in the database, we find that recognition difficulty fails to have a significant effect on dispersion when effects of segmental context are brought under statistical control. We conclude that the pattern of dispersion in Wright (1997) is not due to lexical competition, but is most likely due to segmental context, particularly place of articulation of consonants preceding and following the target vowels. We discuss the implications of this reanalysis for studies of pronunciation variation...|$|E
40|$|Recognition {{technologies}} {{are being used}} extensively in both commercial and research systems. Recognizers are still error-prone however, and this results in performance problems and brittle dialogues, creating barriers to the acceptance and usefulness of recognition systems. Better interfaces to systems using recognition, which can help to reduce the burden of recognition errors, are difficult to build {{because of lack of}} knowledge about the ambiguity inherent in recognition.

OOPS consists of a library of reusable error correction, or mediation, techniques drawn from the survey, combined with necessary architectural extensions to model and to provide structured support for ambiguity at the input event level of a GUI toolkit.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{whether there is a}} premium for lack of recognition, as theorised by Mertron (1987, A Simple Model of Capital Market Equilibrium with Incomplete Information. Journal of Finance 42, 483 - 510) among Australian-listed equities in the light of potential opposing pricing effects where short sale constraints are binding. Originality: First Australian study to examine cross-sectional pricing <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> and to consider the possible confounding effects of binding short sale constraints. Uses a unique database, CHESS, in the measure of ‘recognition’. Key literature / theoretical perspective: Merton (1987) suggests that where we do not know of all securities, less-recognised firms pay a premium return to compensate for the idiosyncratic risk borne in under- diversified portfolios. The return is predicted to be increasing in idiosyncratic risk. However, evidence of negative returns to idiosyncratic risk suggest that binding short sale constraints may cause stocks that are typically less recognised, to be overvalued where differences of opinion are significant (Miller, 1977). Empirical evidence is mixed. Design/methodology/approach: Utilises portfolio sort and regression techniques. Choice of recognition proxy allows determination of effect by investor type (eg individuals as opposed to institutions). Research limitations/implications: Recognition-enhancing strategies reduce a firm’s cost of capital and provide a competitive advantage. 2 page(s...|$|E

40|$|It is a {{well-established}} fact that top-down processes influence neural representations in lower-level visual areas. Electrophysiological recordings in monkeys {{as well as}} theoretical models suggest that these top-down processes depend on NMDA receptor functioning. However, this underlying neural mechanism has not been tested in humans. We used fMRI multivoxel pattern analysis to compare the neural representations of ambiguous Mooney images before and after they were recognized with their unambiguous grayscale version. Additionally, we administered ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, to interfere with this process. Our results demonstrate that after recognition, the pattern of brain activation elicited by a Mooney image is more {{similar to that of}} its easily recognizable grayscale version than to the pattern evoked by the identical Mooney image before recognition. Moreover, recognition of Mooney images decreased mean response; however, neural representations of separate images became more dissimilar. So from the neural perspective, unrecognizable Mooney images all "look the same", whereas recognized Mooneys look different. We observed these effects in posterior fusiform part of lateral occipital cortex and in early visual cortex. Ketamine distorted these <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition,</b> but in early visual cortex only.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether market prices {{are affected by}} the reporting regime of information items, i. e., being recognized in financial statements or only disclosed in footnotes. This investigation is motivated by the ongoing debate over recognition versus disclosure, and the widely held beliefs regarding implications of the Market Efficiency Hypothesis (semi-strong form). Using a unique setting provided by firms’ recognition of Employee Stock Option (ESO) expense, I find the information content of recognized and disclosed ESO expense is significantly different. Specifically, it appears that investors value ESO expense reported under the recognition regime more as an expense compared with under the disclosure regime. To ensure that this result is not driven by contracting theory-related factors, the second set of tests examines market reactions around adoption announcements. The evidence does not support the conjecture that pricing <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> versus disclosure are driven by contracting factors. Overall, the results suggest that the information aggregation process is not completely independent of whether information is recognized or disclosed, which is consistent with the following explanations: (1) informational efficiency in the presence of information costs (Grossman and Stiglitz, 1980; Barth et al., 2003); and (2) limited arbitrage in the presence of noise trading and arbitrage costs (De Long et al., 1990; Shleifer and Vishny, 1990, 1997) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{papers in}} this {{collection}} reflect on the various social effects of native title. In particular, the authors consider {{the ways in which}} the implementation of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cwlth), and the native title process for which this Act legislates, allow for the recognition and translation of Aboriginal law and custom, and facilitate particular kinds of coexistence between Aboriginal title holders and other Australians. In so doing, the authors seek to extend the debate on native title beyond questions of practice and towards an improved understanding of the effects of native title on the social lives of Indigenous Australians and on Australian society more generally. These attempts to grapple with the effects of native title have, in part, been impelled by Indigenous people’s complaints about the Act and the native title process. Since the Act was passed, many Indigenous Australians have become increasingly unhappy with both the strength and forms of recognition afforded to traditional law and custom under the Act, as well as the with socially disruptive effects of the native title process.

40|$|In the 20 {{years since}} the {{publication}} of Charles Taylor’s essay on ‘The Politics of Recognition’ (Taylor, 1992) and Axel Honneth’s book Kampf um Anerkennung (see Honneth, 1995), there has been an incremental proliferation in literature tackling the concept of recognition. While sometimes conflated with related issues, especially concerning the politics of identity and difference, the politics of recognition has provided a distinctive and valuable perspective on the implications of a broad repertoire of sociological and political ‘differences’. This is because the idea of recognition has been employed not only as a normative concept of justice, but also as a means of understanding a range of phenomena, including the formation of individual psyches, the dynamics of political struggles, and the nature of moral progress (Seymour, 2010). As such, the politics of recognition has become a cornerstone in debates about the best way to respond to people’s desire to have their cultural particularities acknowledged, and has traversed a number of important issues: from the tension between individual freedom and group equality in multicultural societies, through the intersections between the multiple inequalities that permeate such societies, and the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> on individual psyche, to the nature of global justice. In short, the politics of recognition is an area of social and political theory that is characterized by lively debate about a range of important and topical issues (Thompson, 2006) ...|$|E

Factors of lexical competition in vowel articulation. In J. Local, R. Ogden & R. Temple (Eds.), Papers in laboratory phonology, Vol. VI (pp. 26 – 50)) reported that vowel dispersion, i. e. {{distance from the}} center of the talker's F 1 /F 2 space, was greater in words that represented difficult recognition targets (‘hard’ words) than in easy recognition targets (‘easy’ words). The goal of the current study was to test whether that effect persisted when controlling for known other determinants of F 1 and F 2. A second goal was to test whether the pattern observed in the recordings analysed in Wright (2004) extended to all monophthongs in the set of recordings of which the words analysed in Wright (2004) formed a subset. We find that the dispersion difference between ‘easy’ and ‘hard’ words vowel dispersion is expected, given previous observations about effects of phonetic environment on vowel formants. When segmental context is taken into account, recognition difficulty fails to be predictive of vowel dispersion, both in the subset and in the larger database. An analysis of the fitted values of models of F 1 and F 2 based on consonantal factors (but not recognition difficulty) shows that the formant values predicted by those models separate vowels in “easy” and “hard” words in the manner observed in W 2004. We discuss the implications for the effect of phonological neighbourhood density on language production, and for the relationship between lexical retrieval, auditory recognition difficulty and pronunciation variation...|$|E

Nearly 2000 attenders of 25 GPs were screened with the GHQ and a stratified sample of 296 patients was examined twice, using the Present State Examination (PSE) and Groningen Social Disability Schedule (GSDS). Prevalence rates of PDs according to the GHQ, GP and PSE were 46 %, 26 % and 15 % respectively. For the 1450 ‘new’ patients, i. e. patients who had no PD diagnosed by their GP in the 12 {{months prior to the}} enrolment visit, these rates were 38 %, 14 %, and 10 %. GPs missed half of the PSE cases and typically assigned non-specific diagnoses to recognized cases. Depressions were more readily recognized than anxiety disorders, and the detection rates for severe disorders were higher than those for less severe disorders. Recognition was strongly associated with management and outcome. Recognized as compared to non-recognized cases were more likely to receive mental health interventions from their GP and had better outcomes in terms of both psychopathology and social functioning. Initial severity, psychological reasons for encounter, recency of onset, diagnostic category, and psychiatric comorbidity were related to both better recognition and outcome.

Material and methods: In-hospital cardiac arrest teams at our hospital were instructed to complete a questionnaire following every emergency call between July 2011 and June 2013. Data on all resuscitation attempts were collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 65 in-hospital resuscitations were recorded in 42 males (64. 6 %) and 23 females (35. 4 %) (mean age 72. 0 ± 14. 3 years). A total of 54 (83. 1 %) cardiac arrests were witnessed; seven (10. 8 %) showed a shockable rhythm {{at the time of the}} first ECG. Resuscitation attempts lasted 29. 3 ± 41. 3 minutes, and 4. 1 ± 3. 1 mg epinephrine was given. Return of spontaneous circulation could be achieved in 38 patients (58. 5 %); 29 (44. 6 %) survived the first day, 23 (35. 4 %) the seventh day, and 15 patients (23. 1 %) were discharged alive. Significantly more in-hospital resuscitations were obtained for those performed during non-regular working hours (P< 0. 001), with higher neuron-specific enolase levels at 72 hours after resuscitation during nonregular working hours (P= 0. 04). Patients who were discharged alive were significantly younger (P= 0. 01), presented more often with an initial shockable rhythm (P= 0. 04), and had a shorter duration of resuscitation (P< 0. 001) with the need of a lower dose of epinephrine (P< 0. 001).

In SDR, a set of automatically transcribed speech documents constitutes the files for retrieval, to which a user may address a request in natural language. This article deals with two probabilistic aspects in SDR. The first part investigates the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> errors on retrieval performance and inquires the question, why recognition errors have only a little effect on the retrieval performance. In the second part, we present a new probabilistic approach to SDR that is based on interpolations between document representations. Experiments performed on the TREC- 7 and TREC- 8 SDR task show comparable or even better results for the new proposed method than other advanced heuristic and probabilistic retrieval metrics...|$|R
