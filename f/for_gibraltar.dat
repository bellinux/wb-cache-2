5|$|Putting {{in at the}} Atlantic Basin Iron Works {{again in}} June, the ship was renamed USAHS Shamrock in August 1943. With the {{conversion}} complete, the new hospital ship left New York in September <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar</b> and the Mediterranean where she operated locally, calling often at Oran, Palermo, the southern beaches of France, Bizerte, and Naples. By mid-February 1944, Shamrock had transported 11,989 patients before departing Gibraltar for Charleston (via Bermuda), where she arrived in early March. After undergoing some repairs and alterations at Charleston, Shamrock sailed again <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar</b> for another {{tour of duty in}} the Mediterranean area from May to September. After transporting over 6,000 patients during this mission, she returned via Horta, Azores, to Charleston in late September.|$|E

During {{the afternoon of}} 21 March 1946, she received {{the remains of the}} Turkish Ambassador to the United States, Münir Ertegün. She departed on 22 March <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar,</b> and on 5 April anchored in the Bosphorus off Istanbul. She rendered full honors, including the firing of 19-gun salutes during the transfer of the remains of the late ambassador and again during the funeral ashore.|$|E

5|$|In March, {{the carrier}} loaded a dozen Hurricane IIs and three Skuas and {{delivered}} them to Gibraltar on 29 March, {{where they were}} loaded onto Ark Royal and flown off to Malta a few days later. She returned to the United Kingdom on 11 April and loaded six replacement Swordfish as well as six Swordfish of 812 Squadron for self-defence. After a brief refit, Argus sailed on 14 April <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar</b> to transfer the replacements to Ark Royal. She arrived on 24 April and began a two-week refit after the aircraft were transferred. The ship {{was back in the}} United Kingdom, loading another batch of Hurricanes bound <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar.</b> Three Fulmars of 800X Squadron were also embarked to protect the ship against the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors that patrolled the Bay of Biscay and the Eastern Atlantic. The carrier arrived on 31 May and disembarked all her aircraft, including 800X Squadron. On her return to the United Kingdom she began a refit.|$|E
5|$|Omaha {{set sail}} <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar</b> on 30 March 1938, for {{service in the}} Mediterranean Sea. Arriving in Marseille, France, 27 April 1938, she would remain in the Mediterranean for over a year, until 2 May 1939. She visited Villefranche-sur-Mer, and Menton, France, during her time before departing from Malta, for her return to the US and an {{extensive}} overhaul from 17 June until October 1939. It was during this time that, on 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, starting what would become World War II.|$|E
5|$|A third frigate {{was visible}} on the horizon. Emerald {{immediately}} set off in pursuit but Duckworth recalled her and instead ordered her to locate the merchant ships; she secured four of the largest vessels by nightfall. The {{need to make the}} two captured frigates ready to sail delayed Leviathan, and by the time this was completed the third frigate had made her escape. Leviathan then returned to rendezvous with Emerald, managing to take a further enemy brig before night fell. The following day, both British vessels sailed <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar</b> with their prizes. On arrival, they encountered Incendiary, which had made port the previous day with two captured vessels of its own. The small British squadron managed to secure nine merchant vessels and two frigates in total.|$|E

5|$|After sailing for the Clyde {{and back}} to New York in July on its first mercy mission, Blanche F. Sigman moved to its new homeport of Charleston in August 1944. Sailing later that month, the Sigman headed to the Mersey and Liverpool. In October the ship sailed <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar,</b> Oran, and Leghorn. In December, it {{repeated}} its previous voyage but also stopped at Naples as well, eventually making its way back to Charleston in January 1945. Throughout 1945, the hospital ship made six transatlantic treks, visiting Marseille three times, Naples, Oran, Gibraltar, Milford Haven, Wales, Avonmouth, Cherbourg, and Horta. The Sigmans sixth mission {{of the year was}} a return trip to Cherbourg that ended with a return to its new homeport of New York.|$|E
5|$|American {{proceeded}} to Halifax, {{where she had}} her collision damage repaired {{over the next six}} weeks. She departed <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar</b> on 27 November, {{a little more than two}} weeks after the signing of the Armistice with Germany that ended the fighting. After calling at that British port on 9 December, American docked at Marseilles, before leaving for New York in the new year, arriving there on 9 February 1919. American was decommissioned and returned to American-Hawaiian on 4 March, and formally struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 14 May.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{preparations}} for another resupply convoy for Malta (Operation Pedestal), Argus returned to the United Kingdom in late June to load reserve aircraft, including six Sea Hurricanes of 804 Squadron, for the other aircraft carriers involved in the operation and left the Clyde on 2 August <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar.</b> The ship rendezvoused with the other carriers on 5 August for a three-day training exercise to work out coordination procedures before the operation commenced and 804 Squadron was deemed not ready for combat. It was ordered {{to return to the}} UK aboard Argus.|$|E
5000|$|Priestley {{was then}} called up <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar's</b> next two friendlies against the Faroe Islands and Estonia on 1 March 2014 and 5 March 2014, respectively. Against the Faroe Islands, Priestley came off the bench as a second-half {{substitute}} as head coach Allen Bula gave new striker Reece Styche an opportunity to start. The addition of Priestley at the half was noted <b>for</b> strengthening the <b>Gibraltar</b> attack, despite not changing the scoreline in the 1-4 defeat. [...] For the match against Estonia, Bula once again chose Priestley as his starting forward.|$|R

50|$|The Water {{catchments}} above Sandy Bay {{were built}} in stages between 1903 and 1961, and were designed to cater <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar's</b> ever increasing demand. The original plan was to cover an area of 10 acre. Between 1911 and 1914 a fifth reservoir was excavated inside the Rock and the catchment area increased to 24 acre. By 1961 the total catchment area had increased to its maximum of 34 acre.|$|R
5|$|Recommissioned in July, {{she made}} a final visit to Belfast from 2329 November, before paying off into reserve on 25 February 1963. In July 1963 Belfast was recommissioned for the last time, with a crew of the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) {{and a number of}} Sea Cadets flying the flag of the Admiral Commanding Reserves, Rear Admiral Hugh Martell. Belfast sailed <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar</b> in company with sixteen RNR minesweepers for a two-week {{exercise}} in the Mediterranean on 10 August. Martell's obituarist considered this commission a well-judged contrivance which 'did much to restore the confidence and image of the new RNR' which had undergone an acrimonious amalgamation with the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in 1958.|$|E
5|$|The V-2 {{damage to}} Timothy Bloodworth was {{considered}} slight, {{so it did}} not prevent her from sailing from Antwerp two days later. On 30 December, she left Liverpool for New York and arrived on 13 January 1945. The cargo ship headed south to Hampton Roads and departed <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar</b> on 7 February. She put in at Gibraltar on 23 February and sailed for Oran. From that port she returned to Hampton Roads on 24 March in convoy GUS 76. Timothy Bloodworth next sailed from New York for Liverpool, Southend, and Antwerp, arriving at the latter port on 30 April. She was at Antwerp on Victory in Europe Day. Timothy Bloodworths last reported movement was in convoy ATM 168 from Antwerp to Southend on 28/29 May.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the autumn}} of 1941, U-boats began {{operating}} further into the Atlantic. Coastal Command's requirement programme was 150 Catalinas and 76 Sunderlands for 26 flying-boat units; 32 Liberators and 32 Wellingtons or Whitleys to equip four long-range GR squadrons; 64 Mosquitoes and 180 GR Hudsons for 15 medium to long-range units; 128 Beauforts for eight torpedo-bomber squadrons; and 160 Beaufighters for 10 long-range fighter squadrons.

5|$|While Mary Celeste {{prepared}} to sail, another brigantine, the Canadian , lay in nearby Hoboken, New Jersey, awaiting a cargo of petroleum destined for Genoa via Gibraltar. Her captain, David Morehouse, {{and his first}} mate Oliver Deveau, were Nova Scotians, both highly experienced and respected seamen. As captains with common interests, {{it is likely that}} Morehouse and Briggs knew each other, if only casually. Some accounts assert that they were close friends who, on the evening before Mary Celestes departure, dined together, but the evidence for this is limited to a recollection by Morehouse's widow, 50 years after the event. Dei Gratia departed <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar</b> on November 15, eight days after Mary Celeste, following the same general route.|$|E
5|$|With {{the signing}} of the Anglo-Polish {{military}} alliance impending, Pułaski sailed from Gdynia to Falmouth on 24 August 1939. On 26 September, the ship left Dartmouth <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar</b> (calling there on 2 September) and Piraeus, where she arrived on 13 October. Picking up Polish soldiers there, she sailed five days later for Marseille, where she eventually arrived on 2 December. Until March 1940, Pułaski underwent a refit in Marseille after which she sailed under charter to the French Fabre Line. At the end of the 1930s, the Fabre Line sailed ships on a Marseille–Dakar route with intermediate stops in other African ports.|$|E
5|$|During the passage, Nelson {{captured}} the Spanish frigate Santa Sabina and placed Lieutenants Jonathan Culverhouse and Thomas Hardy {{in charge of}} the captured vessel, taking the Spanish captain on board Minerve. Santa Sabina {{was part of a larger}} Spanish force, and the following morning two Spanish ships-of-the-line and a frigate were sighted closing fast. Unable to outrun them, Nelson initially determined to fight but Culverhouse and Hardy raised the British colours and sailed northeast, drawing the Spanish ships after them until being captured, giving Nelson the opportunity to escape. Nelson went on to rendezvous with the British fleet at Elba, where he spent Christmas. He sailed <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar</b> in late January, and after learning that the Spanish fleet had sailed from Cartagena, stopped just long enough to collect Hardy, Culverhouse, and the rest of the prize crew captured with Santa Sabina, before pressing on through the straits to join Sir John Jervis off Cadiz.|$|E

5|$|Implacable was recommissioned on 16 January 1952 as the {{flagship}} of the Home Fleet Training Squadron. On 13 February {{she arrived at}} Dover {{to serve as the}} port's guard ship before and after the state funeral of King George VI, to salute royalty and heads of state arriving by sea. After its conclusion, the ship sailed for the western Mediterranean to rendezvous with her sister for exercises. In June the two sisters represented a fast troop convoy being attacked by aircraft during an air defence exercise. They visited Copenhagen in the next month before returning home. Implacable sailed <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar</b> on 25 September and made a port visit to Lisbon, Portugal before returning to Devonport for a refit. On 16 November she had an oil fire in her galley that damaged her electrical wiring badly enough to require extending her refit to 20 January 1953. She spent most of February and March in the western Mediterranean together with her sister, participating in exercises before sailing to Southampton for a brief refit.|$|E
5|$|In late August {{to early}} September, Argus transported 24 Hurricanes of No. 151 Wing RAF to Murmansk, Russia. She then ferried a dozen Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers of 828 Squadron to Gibraltar on 30 September for {{eventual}} delivery to Malta. She was to ferry the fighters of 804 Squadron on her return trip to England, {{but this was}} cancelled. Eventually, the ship loaded some damaged aircraft and accompanied Eagle back to the United Kingdom on 20 October. Argus loaded more Hurricanes <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar</b> and also embarked a pair of Swordfish from 818 Squadron and two Sea Hurricanes from 804X Squadron for self-defence. The ship arrived on 8 November and she transferred some of her Hurricanes to Ark Royal. Two days later, the two carriers, in Operation Perpetual, sailed {{to the west of}} Sicily and flew off their 37 Hurricanes; three of the fighters were lost en route. Ark Royal was torpedoed and sunk during the return to Gibraltar, which forced Argus to remain there to provide cover for Force H as the sole carrier available.|$|E
5|$|Swiftsure {{left the}} Dardanelles in February 1916, departing Kephale on 7 February 1916 <b>for</b> <b>Gibraltar,</b> {{where she was}} {{attached}} to the 9th Cruiser Squadron for service on the Atlantic Patrol and convoy escort duty in the Atlantic. She transferred out of the 9th Cruiser Squadron in March 1917, departing Sierra Leone on 26 March and arriving at Plymouth on 11 April. Swiftsure was paid off at Chatham on 26 April to provide crews for anti-submarine vessels. She then went into reserve, undergoing a refit at Chatham in mid-1917 and being employed as an accommodation ship beginning in February 1918. In the autumn of 1918 she was disarmed and stripped for use as a blockship in a proposed second attempt to block the entrance to the harbor at Ostend, but the war ended before this operation could take place. The ship was briefly used as a target ship before she was listed for sale in March 1920. Swiftsure was sold for scrap on 18 June 1920 to the Stanlee Shipbreaking Company.|$|E
