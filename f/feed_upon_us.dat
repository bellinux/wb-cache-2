Three suits of Lincoln green shalt thou have a year, besides forty marks in fee; thou shalt share all {{with us and}} lead a right merry life in the greenwood; for cares have we not, and misfortune cometh not <b>upon</b> <b>us</b> within the sweet shades of Sherwood, where we shoot the dun deer and <b>feed</b> <b>upon</b> venison and sweet oaten cakes, and curds and honey.

Here man has but reached a stage {{analogous}} to the Stone Age of our own world's history, but for countless millions of years these reptiles have been progressing. Possibly it is the sixth sense which I am sure they possess that has given them an advantage over the other and more frightfully armed of their fellows; but this we may never know. They look <b>upon</b> <b>us</b> as we look upon the beasts of our fields, and I learn from their written records that other races of Mahars <b>feed</b> <b>upon</b> men--they keep them in great droves, as we keep cattle. They breed them most carefully, {{and when they are}} quite fat, they kill and eat them." ...|$|R

Men destroy us wantonly; other animals and the sly serpents prey <b>upon</b> <b>us</b> and our eggs for food; but these are open enemies, and we know how we may best avoid them. Our most {{dangerous}} foes are those bandits of our own race who, instead of protecting their brethren, steal our eggs and murder our young. They are not always the biggest birds, by any means, that do these things. The crow family is known to be treacherous, and the shrike is rightly called the 'butcher-bird,' but there are many others that we have reason to suspect <b>feed</b> <b>upon</b> their own race." ...|$|R

50|$|Open brain corals are nocturnal feeders {{and extend}} their {{stinging}} tentacles {{only in the}} evening and night hours. They do so to filter zooplankton, phytoplankton and any small organism that swims in the surrounding water to <b>feed</b> <b>upon.</b> Open brain corals are able to <b>feed</b> <b>upon</b> organisms such as small fish because the individual polyps work together to catch the pray with their stinging tentacles.|$|R

40|$|As it <b>feeds</b> <b>upon</b> cattle, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus {{is capable}} of {{transmitting}} a number of pathogenic organisms, including the apicomplexan hemoparasite Babesia bovis, a causative agent of bovine babesiosis. The R. microplus female gut transcriptome was studied for two cohorts: adult females feeding on a bovine host infected with B. bovis and adult females feeding on an uninfected bovine. RNA was purified and used to generate a subtracted cDNA library from B. bovis-infected female gut, and 4, 077 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were sequenced. Gene expression was also measured by a microarray designed from the publicly available R. microplus gene index: BmiGI Version 2. We compared gene expression in the tick gut from females <b>feeding</b> <b>upon</b> an uninfected bovine to gene expression in tick gut from females <b>feeding</b> <b>upon</b> a splenectomized bovine infected with B. bovis. Thirty-three ESTs represented on the microarray were expressed {{at a higher level}} in female gut samples from the ticks <b>feeding</b> <b>upon</b> a B. bovis-infected calf compared to expression levels in female gut samples from ticks feeding on an uninfected calf. Forty-three transcripts were expressed at a lower level in the ticks <b>feeding</b> <b>upon</b> B. bovis-infected female guts compared with expression in female gut samples from ticks feeding on the uninfected calf. These array data were used as initial characterization of gene expression associated with the infection of R. microplus by B. bovis...|$|R

5|$|Larvae hatch {{from their}} egg casing {{in two to}} six weeks. They are born carnivores, feeding instinctively on small {{invertebrates}} that move in their field of vision. Food items include small aquatic crustaceans (cladocerans, copepods and ostracods), aquatic dipterans and tadpoles. As they develop, they naturally <b>feed</b> <b>upon</b> larger prey. To increase their chances for survival, some individuals grow bigger heads and become cannibals, and <b>feed</b> <b>upon</b> their own brood mates.|$|R
