40|$|By {{its very}} nature, {{advertising}} is a prominent feature of economic life. Advertising reaches consumers through their TV sets, radios, newspapers, magazines, mailboxes, computers and more. Not surprisingly, the associated advertising expenditures can be huge.

S., General Motors spent $ 3. 43 billion to advertise its cars and trucks; Procter and Gamble devoted $ 3. 32 {{billion to the}} advertisement of its detergents and cosmetics; and Pfizer incurred a $ 2. 84 billion dollar advertising expense for its <b>drugs.</b> <b>Advertising</b> is big business indeed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to examine}} general public {{knowledge}} and behavior toward pharmaceutical advertisements in the Western part of KSA. A cross sectional convenience sampling technique {{was used in this}} study. A total of 1445 valid questionnaires were received and analyzed using SPSS version 16 at alpha value of 0. 05. Majority of respondents were aware of different types of <b>drugs</b> to be <b>advertised</b> and <b>drug</b> advertisements should seek approval from the health authorities. Television and Internet showed the highest effect on consumers. Almost half of the participants preferred an <b>advertised</b> <b>drug</b> over non-advertised one. Most {{of the respondents indicated that}} the quality of frequently <b>advertised</b> <b>drugs</b> is not better than those prescribed by the doctors. Majority of participants had positive beliefs toward <b>advertised</b> <b>drugs</b> concerning their role in education and spreading of awareness among the public. Pharmaceutical advertisements harm the doctor–patient relationship as evidenced by one-third of the investigated sample. Moreover, majority of the participants mentioned that they would consult another doctor or even change the current doctor if he/she refused to prescribe an advertised medication. Results of this study could be used to develop awareness programs for the general public and try to enforce the regulations and policies to protect the general public and patients from the business oriented pharmaceutical companies and drug suppliers...|$|R
40|$|As {{consumer}} {{beliefs about}} direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising vary, {{two different types}} of beliefs (beliefs about DTC advertising and beliefs about quality of treatment) are associated with how consumers beliefs affect behavioral intentions. The authors also consider how consumers judgments of DTC <b>advertising</b> of prescription <b>drugs</b> vary with different levels of credibility. Taking a moderating effect perspective on the consumer beliefs-behavioral intentions formation, the authors theorize that the lower level of credibility is a key element in facilitating consumer activity. Data from Singaporean had been used to test a proposed model. The findings show that the effect of beliefs about quality of prescription <b>drugs</b> <b>advertised</b> on behavioral intention is more powerful than the effect of beliefs about DTC advertising. The interaction effects suggest that at a lower level of credibility on DTC advertising, consumers are likely to discuss this matter with their doctors to increase their confidence...|$|R

40|$|Prescription <b>drug</b> direct-to-consumer <b>advertising</b> (DTCA) {{has been}} a subject of {{controversy}} in recent years. Though government regulations require equivalent prominence of risks and benefits, there is concern {{about the ability of}} consumers with limited health literacy to fully comprehend the risks and benefits associated with drug use. Evaluating the images in DTCA is important because individuals may rely on the visual message if the wording is overly complex. Using semiotics, this study aims to evaluate whether there is functional equivalence in the presentation of risk and benefit information in prescription <b>drug</b> direct-to-consumer television <b>advertising.</b> A new analytical method is created and used to assess the consistency between the messages contained in the voice track, the primary visual images, and the superscript/ subscript text. The results indicate that risk and benefit messages in this DTCA sample lack functional equivalence. However, it is important to properly frame these findings as the study does not evaluate viewer comprehension of the various message structures...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine how}} {{consumers}} react to direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) by investigating {{the role of}} goal compatibility between motivation to process advertisements and consumer self-concept. Specifically, we examine the interaction between self-regulatory (prevention versus promotion) focus and self-construal orientation (independent versus interdependent) and find that prevention (versus promotion) focused consumers form stronger intentions to speak with physicians {{and are more likely}} to discuss an <b>advertised</b> <b>drug,</b> when the ad uses an interdependence self-construal theme, whereas promotion (versus prevention) focused consumers form stronger intentions to speak with physicians {{and are more likely to}} discuss an <b>advertised</b> <b>drug,</b> when the ad uses an independent self-construal theme. The above two-way interaction was further found to be governed by attitudes toward DTCA. Under goal compatibility, consumers who had positive or neutral attitudes toward DTCA (versus negative) had stronger (a) intentions to speak with physicians about the <b>advertised</b> <b>drug,</b> (b) stronger intentions to speak with physicians about high cholesterol, (c) greater likelihood of discussing the drug with health professionals, and (d) greater likelihood of requesting a prescription, yet did not differ in perceptions of drug benefits and risks.

40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. A 1997 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{guideline}} change allowed {{pharmaceutical companies}} to target audiences through television and print media whereas before, the FDA requirements were so extensive that advertising to consumers was unprofitable. The onslaught of advertisements for prescription pharmaceuticals since 1997 {{has resulted in}} an increase in drugs prescribed to consumers, and a higher likelihood of a consumer receiving a prescription for a requested drug when that <b>drug</b> has been <b>advertised.</b> The informational value of advertisements to consumers varies widely, and the majority of consumers hold misperceptions about the federal requirements of pharmaceutical advertisements, many believing that the advertisements are government-approved or that the <b>drugs</b> <b>advertised</b> are ???completely safe???. 	The literature review revealed that the arguments supporting direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of prescription pharmaceuticals were theoretical in nature and unfounded while the research supported the conclusion that DTCA causes a net harm to societal health. 	A criteria-alternative matrix was used to evaluate various public policy alternatives using four criteria: cost to implement, effect on the cost of medications, effect on societal health, and effect on reducing the number of drug advertisements in violation of FDA guidelines. After evaluating how well the policy alternatives satisfy the criteria, the alternatives were further assessed to determine how feasible they would be to implement considering the current political climate. 	The policy alternative with the greatest benefit to society is a ban on DTCA in the U. S, however, that policy alternative is the least likely to be implemented due to the current political climate and the influence of the pharmaceutical industry. As other countries consider allowing DTCA, it is essential that they take note of the deleterious effect DTCA has had in the United States. Public Policy and Administratio...|$|R
