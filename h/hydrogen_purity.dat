40|$|Abstract. The most {{promising}} methods for high <b>purity</b> <b>hydrogen</b> production are membranes separation such as polymer, metal, ceramic and composites. It {{is well known}} that Pd and Pd-alloys membranes have excellent properties for hydrogen separation. However, it has hydrogen embrittlement and high cost for practical applications. Therefore, most scientists have studied new materials instead of Pd and Pd-alloys. On the other hand, ceramic materials are great in resistance to acids and chemically stable under high operating temperature. Recent research in cermet materials for membrane applications interests to permeability and selectivity of <b>hydrogen.</b> High <b>purity</b> <b>hydrogen</b> can be produced through simple process by membrane. Recently, research in ceramic composites for membrane applications attract to hydrogen separation. Porous ceramic membrane process which has high permeability and hydrogen flux is chemically and thermally stable. Therefore, they are attractive for applications in hydrogen production process. However, porous ceramic membrane had low selectivity, hard to produce high <b>purity</b> <b>hydrogen.</b> Many studies were carried out Pd and Pd alloys coating, they were fabricated dense cermet membrane.

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} {{an assessment}} of a novel concept to produce high <b>purity</b> <b>hydrogen</b> using mixed oxide ion/electronic conductor (MIEC) membranes and energy provided by solar concentrators (i. e. parabolic troughs or parabolic dishes). The vision of this concept {{is that it will}} be used to produce tons of high <b>purity</b> <b>hydrogen</b> for fuel cells, which is a scarce commodity with an increasing demand from residential and transportation power generation applications. The MIEC membrane activates a steam reforming reaction between water and methane to produce <b>hydrogen</b> of high <b>purity</b> on the water side and syngas on the fuel side. Expectations are that this concept has cost advantages over other thermo-chemical water-dissociation methods, using a lower temperature and no electricity for the reaction process. The thesis’ focus is on techno-economic aspects of the concept, as part of an application process for project financing by the European Commission of Research and Innovation. The assessment in the thesis shows that the overall efficiency of the concept is expected to be very low. It also identifies the difficulties of providing stable working conditions for the concept. Suggestions to improve the concept are proposed to address the most urgent problems of the concept. These suggestions illuminate the opportunities that actually do exist to combine MIEC membranes, solar energy and thermo-chemical water splitting into a working concept. These improvements include using parabolic dishes instead of parabolic troughs, using furnaces with control systems and using a viable flow rate. The production capacity of high <b>purity</b> <b>hydrogen</b> is expected to be approximately 89 mg per minute in a membrane bundle (i. e. 150 thin membrane fibers with an oxygen permeation flux of 1 ml cm- 2 min- 1) if these improvements were implemented.

50|$|The {{bearings}} {{have to be}} leak-tight. A hermetic seal, {{usually a}} liquid seal, is employed; a turbine oil at pressure higher than the hydrogen inside is typically used. A metal, e.g. brass, ring is pressed by springs onto the generator shaft, the oil is forced under pressure between the ring and the shaft; part of the oil flows into the hydrogen side of the generator, another part to the air side. The oil entrains {{a small amount of}} air; as the oil is recirculated, some of the air is carried over into the generator. This causes a gradual air contamination buildup and requires maintaining <b>hydrogen</b> <b>purity.</b> Scavenging systems are used for this purpose; gas (mixture of entrained air and hydrogen, released from the oil) is collected in the holding tank for the sealing oil, and released into the atmosphere; the hydrogen losses have to be replenished, either from gas cylinders or from on-site hydrogen generators. Degradation of bearings leads to higher oil leaks, which increases the amount of air transferred into the generator; increased oil consumption can be detected by a flow meter associated to each bearing.|$|E

40|$|Hydrogen gas {{is used to}} {{cool the}} {{windings}} of most high speed electric generators used in thermal power plants starting with capacities {{in the range of}} 50 MW. As compared to an open air cooling system, a properly operated closed hydrogen system reduces friction, removes heat more effectively, maintains cleaner windings, and is less subject to fouling. Hydrogen is preferred as a generator cover gas rather than air or other gases due to its low density, high heat transfer capacity and high dielectric. Key factors relating to generator efficiency and longevity include hydrogen pressure, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>purity,</b> and the water vapor content of the hydrogen (dewpoint). Operators of hydrogen-cooled power plants employ a variety of techniques to maintain the cover gas hydrogen pure, pressurized and dry. Generator manufacturers typically have allowed a range of hydrogen control techniques to be utilized, with the proviso that <b>hydrogen</b> <b>purity</b> must remain above 75 %, which is the Upper Flammability Limit for hydrogen in air.

40|$|AbstractThe {{sorption}} enhanced {{steam methane reforming}} (SE-SMR) in {{a laboratory}} scale fluidized bed reactor is investigated using a three-fluid model. The binary sorbent and catalyst particles segregate due to the density difference between them. The light sorbent particles tend to rise and the heavy catalyst particles tend to sink initially. As the process proceeds, the sorbent particles adsorb more CO 2 and become heavier, and the density difference between the binary particles will become smaller, thus {{they tend to be}} well-mixed. As the sorbent particles are either at the upper sections of the bed or well-mixed with the catalysts, the adsorption of CO 2 can always play the role of sorption enhancement, the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>purity</b> at the outlet is between 98 - 99 % before the breakthrough, which is much higher than that (73 - 74 %) of steam methane reforming (SMR) process. Due to the exothermic CO 2 adsorption reaction and the mixing of the gas particle flows, a homogeneous gas/particle temperature distribution is found in the whole bed.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{technical}} aspects of innovative hydrogen production concepts based on coal gasification with CO 2 capture. More specifically, it focuses on the technical evaluation and the assessment of performance of a number of plant configurations based on standard entrained flow gasification processes (dry feed and slurry feed types) producing hydrogen at pipeline pressure, which incorporate improvements for increasing <b>hydrogen</b> <b>purity</b> and pressure. Also, different CO 2 capture methods (physical vs. chemical solvents) are assessed. The dry feed type of entrained flow gasifier is currently considered to be the most efficient means of producing hydrogen from coal. The main shortcomings are relatively low <b>hydrogen</b> <b>purity</b> due to the need of using nitrogen as a transport gas for the coal and a pressure limitation of this type of design. The purity issue can be solved by using captured CO 2 or syngas to transport the coal in the gasifier. The pressure limitation can be overcome by using in-plant compression of the raw syngas. Simulations, made in ChemCAD, show that these changes can be made without compromising the plant efficiency; on the contrary, the efficiency slightly increases because of the better thermal integration of the plant.
