The moment equilibrium equation of downhole blowout preventer is established. The structural {{dimensions of the}} valve plate connecting position of blowout preventer and pulley rope location are optimized. The dynamic simulation of pulley type downhole blowout preventer is carried out to improve the parameters of this new blowout preventer and to improve its motion performance and mechanical properties. ...|$|E
30|$|The working {{characteristic}} of dual-horsehead pump units was slow upstroke and fast down stroke that can increase its system efficiency, and can decrease the maximum suspend velocity and the maximum suspend acceleration {{that was good}} for decreasing suspend dynamic load (Liu and Feng 2014). However, the flexible <b>drive</b> <b>rope</b> was easy to worn {{so that it was}} not suitable for oil well with higher working load. It is the reason that the dual-horsehead pump units was not more widely used than the phased pump units.|$|E
30|$|Since the dual-horsehead {{pumping units}} {{were used in}} 1996, its {{application}} results indicated that its energy-saving rate was about 20 – 30 % (Wang 2006; Chi et al. 2011). The dual-horsehead pump units were reformed with a flexibility reconfiguration, based on the conventional beam pumping units. Its back arm of walking beam was connected a horsehead having a variable radius of curvature. The walking beam connected the linkage rod with flexible <b>drive</b> <b>rope.</b> This variable length four-bar linkage could decrease the torque factor that could decrease the polished torque and avoided the negative torque, and the motor efficiency would be improved (Liu and Feng 2014).|$|E
50|$|As mill engines {{became more}} powerful, from around 1870 {{there was a}} shift from single belt <b>drives</b> to {{multiple}} <b>rope</b> <b>drives.</b> The barring engine needed to turn these <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> over as well (although they were disconnected from the machinery at the remote end) and a simple manual gear was no longer sufficient. Around 1881-1883 there was a shift {{to the use of}} steam-powered barring engines.|$|R

5000|$|There are {{technical}} regulations for the <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> of cranes, elevators, rope ways and mining installations not exceeding a given tensile force and not falling {{short of a}} given diameter ratio D/d of sheave and rope diameters. A general dimensioning method of <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> (and used besides the {{technical regulations}}) calculate the five limits ...|$|R
40|$|Drives are {{basically}} used to transmit power and speed from the prime mover to the machine. The power transmission and speed reduction between the prime-mover and the driven machine {{can be achieved}} by using conventional drives like Belt <b>drive,</b> <b>Rope</b> drive, Chain drive, Gears, etc. with their numerous advantages and disadvantages. There are many machines and mechanical units that under varying circumstances make it desirable to be able to drive at a barely perceptible speed, an intermediate speed or a high speed. Thus an infinitely variable (step less) speed variation in which it is possible to get any desirable speed. Some mechanical, hydraulic, drives serve as such step less drives. However the torque versus speed characteristics of these drives do not match torque at low speeds. Hence the need of a step less or infinitely variable speed drive came into existence. The drive presented {{by the end of this}} research work is single ball traction drive for continuously variable transmission systems. Dissertation includes the brief history of existing drives, speed prediction methodology and performance analysis of the drive developed...|$|E
60|$|The tunnel was cleared, {{the stake}} <b>driven,</b> the <b>rope</b> extended. As I moved {{forward to the}} place, many of my comrades caught me {{by the hand and}} wrung it, an {{attention}} I could well have done without.|$|R
50|$|In 1888, {{production}} {{had increased}} {{to such an}} extent that the main winding shaft had reached its maximum capacity. The upcast shaft was then fitted out for coal winding and output continued to climb. By 1890, with output averaging 1000 tons per day, the underground haulage of coal from the North dip workings by ponies had become unsustainable and a 60HP electrically driven underground rope-haulage system - the first of its kind in the world - was installed near the downcast pit bottom to haul coal up the 1 in 12 roadway from the North workings. During the next seven years, a further four electrically <b>driven</b> <b>rope</b> haulages were installed, freeing up 44 horses and raising output to 1700 tons per day.|$|R
5000|$|In general, as {{with flat}} belts, <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> {{were used for}} {{connections}} from stationary engines to the jack shafts and line shafts of mills, and sometimes from line shafts to driven machinery. Unlike leather belts, however, <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> were sometimes used to transmit power over relatively long distances. Over long distances, intermediate sheaves were used to support the [...] "flying rope", and in the late 19th century, this was considered quite efficient.|$|R
50|$|These fans {{moved at}} {{relatively}} low speeds, usually being <b>driven</b> by <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> from a horizontal steam engine {{on the ground}} floor below the fan. They always had one single impeller and so to achieve the large air volumes required, they were of large diameter. Although made in a range of sizes, a common large-size fan was 40 ft in diameter. Using a single impeller was common for large ventilation fans, although some makers used a double sided impeller to give twice the airflow for a similar rotating mass. Waddle though always used a single-sided impeller with an overhung bearing at the rear face of the fan. This avoided having the bearings placed in the often damp airstream, simplifying maintenance.|$|R
5000|$|The next {{improvement}} came in 1966, {{when a car}} chassis {{was modified}} to <b>drive</b> the <b>rope</b> tow. There is still a rope tow located {{in the same spot}} but it has been upgraded numerous times over the years. The rope tow works the current [...] "bunny hill" [...] and transports skiers from the main lift to the rental room and the other buildings.|$|R
25|$|A {{prototype}} self-propelled torpedo {{was created}} by a commission placed by Giovanni Luppis, an Austrian naval officer from Rijeka, a port city of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, and Robert Whitehead, an English engineer who was {{the manager of a}} town factory. In 1864, Luppis presented Whitehead with the plans of the salvacoste (coastsaver), a floating weapon <b>driven</b> by <b>ropes</b> from the land that had been dismissed by the naval authorities due to the impractical steering and propulsion mechanisms.|$|R
5000|$|The later engines were large. Arthur Roberts {{reported}} that Hartford Mill was powered by an 1800 hp twin-tandem compound engine by Urmson and Thompson, built in 1907. It was steamed at 160 psi at 68 rpm. It had a 5 ft stroke driving a 24 ft flywheel. The transmission method was a <b>rope</b> <b>drive</b> using 40 <b>ropes.</b> The engine was {{reputed to be}} the only twin-tandem that Urmson & Thompson built. It had two 30" [...] diameter HP (high-pressure) cylinders at the rear, and two 60" [...] LP (low-pressure) cylinders in front. There were Corliss valves on all cylinders. The air pumps were driven from each crosshead. There was a Whitehead governor. The engine cost £5400 and the three boilers cost £1900.|$|R
50|$|The {{power was}} {{provided}} by a Manhattan type steam engine by George Saxon & Co. Transmission was by <b>rope</b> <b>drives.</b> The mill had 137,312 mule spindles which remained until the 1950s when they were replaced by 33,636 ring spindles, the mill being electrified at the same time. It ceased operation as a textile mill in March 1978.|$|R
50|$|The main {{building}} of the Bibb Mill complex is a long five-story brick building, set on a bluff overlooking the river. Although it is an early 20th-century building, {{one of the smaller}} buildings in the complex includes remnants of a pulley and <b>rope</b> <b>drive</b> system. This system was used until 1954, when its main drive shaft broke.|$|R
50|$|Late in the century, Henry Bannermann of Stalybridge {{took over}} the mill. Its beam engine was {{replaced}} by a horizontal engine, and <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> were fitted. New mules were installed longitudinally. In 1909, two towers were constructed and electric motors installed connected by a transformer to the Manchester Corporation Electricity mains. Brunswick was the first mill to be converted to electric in Manchester.|$|R
50|$|Ratha or Rath means a chariot or car {{made from}} wood with wheels. The Ratha may be <b>driven</b> {{manually}} by <b>rope,</b> pulled by horses or elephants. Rathas are used mostly by the Hindu temples of South India for Rathoutsava (Car festival). During the festival, the temple deities are driven through the streets, {{accompanied by the}} chanting of mantra, hymns, shloka or bhajan.|$|R

6000|$|... "When you are <b>driven</b> {{against the}} <b>ropes,</b> 'hit out' {{is the old}} rule of Fistiana and common sense. It is an extreme bore: {{all the more reason}} for showing such an ugly front, as to give people no chance of its {{happening}} again. Nothing so dangerous as half-measures, Headley. 'Resist the devil, and he will flee from you,' your creed says. Mine only translates it into practice." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{ironworks}} {{was reported}} in 1884 to have grindstones of 7 ft (2 metre) diameter; [...] "two cupolas blown by fans, {{one of which is}} capable of melting twenty tons of metal per day"; cranes and hoists; a brass moulding shop; a sand mill (for the mouldings); and a machine for grinding coal to dust. The buildings included a draughtsmen's office; a pattern makers' and joiners' shop; a packing room; an erecting and turning shop; and a smithy. All the machines were <b>driven</b> by <b>rope</b> from a single large wheel; two horizontal steam engines powered the entire ironworks. The journalist noted that [...] "The death rate among grinders is very high indeed, which {{it is almost impossible to}} prevent." ...|$|R
60|$|But this idyllic {{state of}} things {{was not to}} last. The newcomer, {{a tall man with}} a light moustache, which he felt {{carefully}} after every ball, soon settled down. He proved to be a conversationalist. Until he had opened his account, which he did with a strong <b>drive</b> to the <b>ropes,</b> he was silent. When, however, he had seen the ball safely to the boundary, he turned to Reece and began.|$|R
50|$|Satake was pitted in Pride 13 against retired sumo and {{professional}} wrestler Tadao Yasuda. Heavily outweighted, Satake was constantly <b>driven</b> against the <b>ropes</b> by his adversary, which impeded him from landing solid shots. At the end, the unanimous decision {{was given to}} Yasuda for controlling the fight. For the rest of 2001, Satake would fight important strikers, like Igor Vovchanchyn, Semmy Schilt and Sam Greco, losing to the two first and drawing with the third.|$|R
40|$|This topic {{deals with}} the {{fabrication}} and analysis of a stair case lift, which can be use as Material Handling System. A stair case lift is a mechanical device for lifting people and wheelchairs {{up and down on}} the stairs, who may find difficulty in doing so themselves. For sufficiently wide stairs, a rail is mounted to the treads of the stairs. A chair or lifting platform is attached to the rail. A person on the chair or platform is lifted as the chair or platform moves along the rail, old age and goods are to be carried across the stair case. Stair case lift is a type of lift that can be mounted on the stair case without altering civil structure. This lift runs on electric power and consists of a motor, reduction gear box, <b>rope</b> <b>drive,</b> two rails a sliding chair. In this system we use DC motor for changing the polarity of the power supply which will make the motor run in reverse direction connected with the earlier, while the later will form the entire assembly run to in downward direction, with the help of Toggle switches and push buttons. Advantages over the conventional hydraulic lift are no civil structure and alteration is required, low cost, less bulkiness, less power, less maintenance requires. Easy design, easy installations. Can be of industrial use too. Moreover, considering some drawbacks due to weight carrying capacity completely depend upon the capacity of motor. There is lot of scope for further modification in the project as using monorail instead of two. Use of belt drive or chain <b>drive</b> instead of <b>rope</b> <b>drive.</b> Incorporation and automation/ timer unit which will ease the use of device. Rack and carrier arrangement for using the device for curved stair case. Use of work & roller reduction gear assembly...|$|R
5000|$|As {{long as the}} {{clove hitch}} can feed over the drum, the rope will feed through the device. In a fall, the drum is back <b>driven</b> by the <b>rope</b> as the device slides down the rope; when the drum {{rotation}} exceeds a certain angular velocity, it locks off to the frame {{and the increase in}} friction induced between the stationary drum and the rope causes the clove hitch to rapidly tighten around the locked drum to arrest the fall.|$|R
50|$|These were 'standard' mill engines {{preferred}} by the Oldham Limiteds. An early example was the 1,000-ihp engine {{delivered to the}} North Moor spinning company in 1876. The design was conservative, using slide valves and spur wheel gear drive transmission. They did start to fit Corliss valves and <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> in 1883, but these didn't become standard until the 1890s. An example of such an engine was the 2,000-ihp, horizontal twin tandem triple expansion delivered to Pearl Mill in 1892.|$|R
50|$|The {{increasingly}} powerful engines {{required more}} boilers with economisers and superheaters. Mills needed reservoirs {{to supply the}} boilers and condense the steam. The chimneys were round and taller. Three types of engines were used: triple expansion horizontal cross compound engines, Inverted marine type compounds which were more compact, and Manhattans with vertical and horizontal cylinders such as the 3500 hp engine at New Pear Mill. <b>Rope</b> <b>drives</b> were used exclusively. Electricity was gradually introduced firstly on group drives driving a shaft (Little Mill, 1908), {{and then later on}} individual machines.|$|R
5000|$|In its {{original}} plan, {{the plant was}} meant as an independent competitor to the local electric companies, and supplied power to the surrounding towns of Illchester, Ellicott City and Catonsville {{many of which were}} outside of the utilities' service area. It replaced an earlier 300hp plant purchased for $12,000 in 1900 two miles away at Gray's mills that employed a millrace with a bevel gear and <b>rope</b> <b>drive.</b> The $175,000 electric generation equipment was engaged on 28 November 1908 at 3:30pm by Victor Bloede's daughter, Miss Vida Bloede. Waffles were served to 500 dignitaries and guests from electric waffle makers.|$|R
5000|$|Mules and {{man power}} {{had long been}} used {{exclusively}} as the motive power in moving coal from the mines, but this method was expensive and unsatisfactory. Because of the insistent demand for a more economical method, experiments were being conducted using for power - [...] electricity, compressed air and <b>rope</b> <b>drive.</b> Gasoline engines were definitely a novelty in those early days, nevertheless William Whitcomb, together with Eckert, decided the principle could be successfully applied to a small mine locomotive. In April, 1906 the first successful gasoline locomotive was built and installed in a large Central Illinois coal mine.|$|R
50|$|Power Plant and Dam No. 4 is a {{historic}} hydroelectric power generation station on the Potomac River, located near Shepherdstown on the county line between Berkeley and Jefferson County, West Virginia. The power plant is a tall one-story, limestone building on a high stone foundation. It is five bays long and has a gable roof. Dam 4 uses horizontal shaft turbines connected by <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> to horizontal shaft generators. This plant is probably the last commercially operated rope-driven hydroelectric plant in the United States. The building is built into a hillside, so the main floor is the top floor. The power plant was originally built by the Martinsburg Electric Company.|$|R
50|$|The 1865 mill {{consists}} of two five storeyed blocks of 18 bays, with a narrower 9 bay central block for warehousing and offices. The central block has two italianate stair towers and carries a central clock. The floors have become wider to accommodate the larger mules of the period. All floors are fireproof, with transverse vaults. The detached engine house used horizontal shafts that connected to vertical shafts in each spinning block. The chimney was octagonal, on a plinth with a highly embellished oversailer. In the early 20th century this was replaced with separate inverted compound engines for each block with external rope races for <b>rope</b> <b>drives.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{aerial lift}} line was {{constructed}} by the Austrian Doppelmayr Garaventa Group. With its length of 4359 m, {{it is one of}} the longest passenger-carrying aerial tramway lines in the world. There are four supporting towers located between the two terminals. The aerial tram consists of two passenger cabins, each capable of carrying 80 passengers. Two fixed track cables are for support while one loop of cable, solidly connected to the cabins, is for haulage. An electric motor <b>drives</b> the haulage <b>rope,</b> which provides propulsion. When the cabins arrive at the end stations, the cable loop stops and reverses direction so that the cars shuttle back and forth between the terminals.|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{dynamics of}} {{a bundle of}} magnetic flux <b>ropes</b> <b>driven</b> by stationary fluid motions at their endpoints is studied, by performing numerical simulations of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. The development of MHD turbulence is shown, where the system reaches a state that {{is characterized by the}} ratio between the Alfven time (the time for incompressible MHD waves to travel along the field lines) and the convective time scale of the driving motions. This ratio of time scales determines the energy spectra and the relaxation toward different regimes ranging from weak to strong turbulence. A connection is made with phenomenological theories for the energy spectra in MHD turbulence. Comment: Published in Physics of Plasma...|$|R

The executioner was sure to have {{fastened}} the noose securely around his neck, and as he stood Samuel up to try again, the crowd had become boisterous, calling for Samuel to be freed. The executioner very quickly readied another five-hemp rope, ordered the cart driven back, forced Samuel onto it, fastened the noose around his neck, secured it very carefully and tightly, and then ordered the cart <b>driven</b> away. The <b>rope</b> snapped, and Samuel {{dropped to the ground}} and stumbled over, trying to avoid landing on his sprained ankle.|$|R
50|$|The caisson was {{manufactured}} by the notable firm of RR Smellie & Co. of Brisbane. It {{is probably the}} largest locally made wrought iron composition in Queensland.To {{the east of the}} dock is the brick pump house which has an arched roof, supported by timber beams, and a large brick chimney. The two centrifugal pumps for emptying the dock and steam boilers were imported from London. Three new Cornish boilers replaced the originals in 1907 and in 1924 the steam engines were replaced by electric motors constructed by Evans Deakin. During the busy war years the boiler house was enclosed by a concrete blockhouse. The Cornish boilers and their coal chutes, the pump, the electric engine with its sub-station and <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> are extant but inoperative.|$|R
5000|$|Trade journal {{coverage}} of V-belts in automobiles from 1916 mentioned leather as the belt material, and {{mentioned that the}} V angle was not yet well standardized. The endless rubber V-belt was developed in 1917 by John Gates of the Gates Rubber Company. Multiple-V-belt drive was first arranged {{a few years later}} by Walter Geist of the Allis-Chalmers corporation, who was inspired to replace the single rope of multi-groove-sheave <b>rope</b> <b>drives</b> with multiple V-belts running parallel. Geist filed for a patent in 1925, and Allis-Chalmers began marketing the drive under the [...] "Texrope" [...] brand; the patent was granted in 1928 (...)
