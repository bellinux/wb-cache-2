5|$|As Warden, and {{afterwards}} Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 {{percent of the}} coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult. However, Newton proved equal to the task.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} radioactive decay, as <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current data suggest that the universe has a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E
5|$|Italian opera became {{immensely popular}} in the 19th century and was known across <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> rural {{sections}} of the country. Most villages had occasional opera productions, and the techniques used in opera influenced rural folk musics. Opera spread through itinerant ensembles and brass bands, focused in a local village. These civic bands (banda communale) used instruments to perform operatic arias, with trombones or fluegelhorns for male vocal parts and cornets for female parts.|$|E

At Middle Hill Battery, guards had to be posted to prevent soldiers from deserting by lowering themselves on ropes down the cliff face.|$|E
5|$|Sainsbury {{was born}} on 5 July 1851 in Bath, Somerset, the {{youngest}} son of John Popham Sainsbury. He attended Sherborne School, an independent school in north-west Dorset. Playing for the school's cricket eleven he acquired a reputation for his slow underarm bowling, which could deceive <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> wary opponent into conceding his wicket. He was considered an even better batsman, and often opened the innings for the school.|$|E

5|$|The wordless novel genre had flourished {{primarily}} {{during the}} 1920s and 1930s, {{but by the}} 1940s <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> prolific practitioners had abandoned it. Hyde was familiar with some such works by Lynd Ward, Otto Nückel, and the form's pioneer Frans Masereel. The high-contrast artwork of Southern Cross features dynamic curving lines uncommon in wood engraving and combines abstract imagery with realistic detail. It has gained appreciation in comics circles as a precursor to the Canadian graphic novel, though it had no direct influence.|$|E
5|$|According to Beesley, {{many have}} written that {{interest}} in the Deseret alphabet died with Brigham Young. This, however, isn't true; the alphabet was already regarded as a failure during Young's time. Only 500 copies of the full Book of Mormon translated into the Deseret alphabet sold for US$2 each, and even Young realized that the venture was too expensive and <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> devout Mormons could not be convinced to purchase and study the Deseret edition books over the books in the traditional orthography. In the winter of 1870, just one year after their publication, advertisements for the Deseret alphabet books were quietly removed from the Deseret News.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the social}} status of nobles, officials, farmers, and artisan-craftsmen were {{considered}} above the station of the lowly registered merchant, wealthy and successful businessmen acquired huge fortunes which {{allowed them to}} rival the social prestige of <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> powerful nobles and highest officials. Slaves were {{at the bottom of}} the social order, yet they represented only a tiny portion of the overall population. Retainers attached themselves to the estates of wealthy landowners, while medical physicians and state-employed religious occultists could make a decent living. People of all social classes believed in various deities, spirits, immortals, and demons. While Han Daoists were organized into small groups chiefly concerned with achieving immortality through various means, by the mid 2nd century CE they formed large hierarchical religious societies that challenged imperial authority and viewed Laozi (fl. 6th century BCE) as a holy prophet.|$|E
5|$|As he withdrew, Frederick {{established}} a fighting line {{north of the}} village, and it eventually served as a rallying point for stragglers and survivors. By mid-morning, around 10:00, the Prussians retreated to the north-west. Any pursuing troops were met with a wall of musket fire. Frederick and his surviving army were {{out of range of}} the Austrian army by the time they had reorganized. Hans Joachim von Zieten and Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, who also had remained alert all night, organized a rear guard action that prevented the Austrians from falling upon the retreating Prussians. This discouraged <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> determined Austrians; the Croats and irregulars contented themselves with pillaging the village and the Prussian bodies.|$|E

The spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th {{century and}} into the 19th, turnpike trusts were {{established}} and major roads in Cumberland were greatly improved. With the Lake District now accessible by coach the area attracted well-off visitors, particularly at times of war in mainland Europe, which made the aristocratic Grand Tour impossible there. Regular public coach services were established in the 1760s, but they were expensive. The ten-hour journey from Whitehaven to Penrith via Keswick cost 12 shillings (equivalent to 60 pence), {{at a time when}} country labourers typically earned £24 a year or less, and the annual income of <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> prosperous tenant farmers was rarely more than £200. Nonetheless, by the 19th century the number of tourists visiting Keswick during each season was estimated at between 12,000 and 15,000. Some of the Keswick inns that catered for affluent visitors remain as hotels, including the Queen's, where Gray stayed.|$|E
5|$|Every new Queen's Counsel created {{reduced the}} Serjeants in importance, since <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> junior QC took {{precedence}} over the most senior Serjeant. Although appointments were still made to the Serjeants-at-Law, the King's Serjeant and the King's Ancient Serjeant, and several Serjeants were granted patents of precedence which gave them superiority over QCs, the Victorian era saw a decline in appointments. The rule that all common law judges must be Serjeants was circumvented: anyone chosen to be a judge would be appointed a Serjeant, and immediately thereafter a judge. In 1834 Lord Brougham issued a mandate which opened up pleading in the Court of Common Pleas to every barrister, Serjeant or not, and this was followed for six years until the Serjeants successfully petitioned the Queen to overturn it as invalid.|$|E
5|$|Fifty light {{infantry}} {{men were}} in pursuit of Mercer's men when a fresh brigade of 1,100 militiamen {{under the command of}} Cadwalader appeared. Mawhood gathered his men who were all over the battlefield and put them into battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move his men into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> basic military maneuvers. When his men {{reached the top of the}} hill and saw Mercer's men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around and ran back down the hill.|$|E
