In several scenes of Jacob's Ladder, Lyne used a body horror technique {{in which an}} actor is recorded waving his head around at a low frame rate, resulting in horrifically <b>fast</b> <b>motion</b> when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he {{was inspired by the}} art of the painter Francis Bacon when developing the effect. In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to thalidomide deformities to achieve a greater shock effect. After many heated arguments, Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist H. R. Giger and the photographers Diane Arbus and Joel-Peter Witkin for inspiration; another influence came from the Brothers Quay's 1986 stop motion short film Street of Crocodiles.|$|E

40|$|The {{averaging}} setup {{arises in}} the study of perturbations of parametric families of dynamical systems when parameters start changing slowly in time. This situation arises in perturbations of Hamiltonian systems when integrals of motion, e. g. energy, start changing slowly, i. e. we arrive at a double scale system with <b>fast</b> <b>motions</b> along constant energy manifolds of the unperturbed system and with slow motions across these manifolds. Such problems emerged already long ago {{in the study}} of planetary motions considering, for instance, some 3 body problems as perturbations of a 2 body problem (which is an integrable system). People observed that a good approximation of the slow motion can be obtained by averaging its parameters in fast variables though first proofs of the asymptotic validity of this averaging principle were given by Fatou only in 1928 (periodic <b>fast</b> <b>motions)</b> and by Bogoliubov (around the 1940 ies, general case) but only when <b>fast</b> <b>motions</b> do not depend on the slow one (uncoupled) case.

40|$|<b>Fast</b> <b>motions</b> {{of systems}} with {{constrained}} flexible dynamics {{often lead to}} residual vibrations. Established methods for compensating those vibrations such as input-shaping, filtering and feed-forward methods are already available. However, those methods do not explicitly consider input-constraints. As a consequence, they cannot effectively reduce residual vibrations if input-constraints are violated. This depends on the trajectory they are applied on, which is generated by a trajectory planning algorithm. In this paper, a trajectory planning algorithm is introduced which incorporates a residual vibration compensation procedure within the algorithm. In order to minimize the trajectory’s excitation of the resonant frequency, a cost function is defined in the frequency domain and input-constraints are considered in the optimization algorithm.

25|$|We find Hipparchus's {{mathematical}} signatures in the Antikythera Mechanism, {{an ancient}} astronomical computer {{of the second}} century BC.

The study of the Antikythera Mechanism proves that the ancients have been using very accurate calendars based on all the aspects of solar and lunar motion in the sky. In fact, the Lunar Mechanism {{which is part of the}} Antikythera Mechanism depicts the motion of the Moon and its phase, for a given time, using a train of four gears with a pin and slot device which gives a variable lunar velocity that is very close to the second law of Kepler, i.e. it takes into account the <b>fast</b> <b>motion</b> of the Moon at perigee and slower motion at apogee. This discovery proves that Hipparchus mathematics were much more advanced than Ptolemy describes in his books, as it is evident that he developed a good approximation of Kepler΄s second law.|$|E

Furthermore, this approach is shown to be comparable to constraining <b>fast</b> <b>motions,</b> thus providing an alternative to molecular dynamics with constraints.

40|$|Coupling of fast protein {{dynamics}} to enzyme {{chemistry is}} controversial and has ignited considerable debate, especially {{over the last}} 15 years in relation to enzyme-catalysed H-transfer.

Here, we have perturbed vibrational motions in pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase (PETNR) by isotopic substitution where all non-exchangeable atoms were replaced with the corresponding heavy isotope (13 C, 15 N and 2 H).

40|$|Background** Children are not blank slates {{when they}} begin school; they bring prior conceptions about the {{everyday}} world with them. These conceptions usually do not comply with accepted scientific views {{and have to be}} changed within the process of education. However, to do this effectively more needs to be known about the relationship between the everyday world and children’s knowledge of scientific principles. **Purpose** This study sought answers to the question of which object variables children use when reasoning, and how these variables are associated with outcomes. The reported study addresses these issues in relation to object motion. **Sample, design and methods** UK primary school children (n = 144) aged 5 – 11 years were assessed on their predictions of motion along a horizontal, in fall and down an incline using a range of everyday objects by responding to questions where they needed to compare potential motion patterns of the objects. **Results** Round shape and smooth texture of objects were consistently associated with <b>faster</b> <b>motion</b> across age groups as well as across <b>motion</b> dimensions. However, <b>faster</b> horizontal <b>motion</b> was associated with lighter and smaller objects across all ages, whereas faster fall was associated with heavier objects. While younger children predicted <b>faster</b> incline <b>motion</b> for lighter and smaller objects, there was a shift in conceptions with age, with older children predicting <b>faster</b> <b>motion</b> for heavier and bigger objects. **Conclusions** The overall findings are used to support the development of commonsense theories of motion previously identified, and suggestions for educational practice are made.

40|$|For many {{biological}} {{applications of}} molecular dynamics (MD) {{the importance of}} good sampling in conformational space makes it necessary to eliminate the <b>fastest</b> <b>motions</b> from the system {{in order to increase}} the time step. An accurate knowledge of these motions is a necessary prerequisite for such efforts. It is known that harmonic vibrations of bond lengths and bond angles produce the highest frequencies in proteins. There are also <b>fast</b> anharmonic <b>motions,</b> such as inter-atomic collisions, which are probably most important when bond lengths and bond angles are fixed. However, the specific time scales corresponding to all these limitations are not known precisely. In order to clarify the above issue this paper analyses time step limiting factors in a series of numerical tests by using an internal coordinate molecular dynamics approach, which allows chosen internal coordinates to be frozen. It is found that, in proteins, there is a rather complicated hierarchy of <b>fast</b> <b>motions,</b> with both harmonic and anharmonic effects mixed together at several close time scales. Non-bonded interactions, notably strong hydrogen bonding, create locally distributed normal modes with frequencies similar to those of bond stretching between non-hydrogen atoms. They also impose ubiquitous anharmonic limitations starting from rather small step sizes. With fixed standard amino acid geometry, rotations of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups limit time steps at the 5 fsec level. The next important limitation occurs around 10 fsec and is created by collisions between non-hydrogen atoms. Comment: 7 two-column pages, 5 eps figures, RevTeX/LaTe...|$|R
