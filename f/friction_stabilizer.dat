50|$|Swellex {{is similar}} to Friction stabilizers, except the bolt {{diameter}} is smaller than the hole diameter. High pressure water is injected into the bolt to expand the bolt diameter to hold the rock together. Like the <b>friction</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> swellex is poorly protected from corrosion and rust.|$|E
50|$|<b>Friction</b> <b>stabilizer</b> (frequently {{called by}} the genericized {{trademark}} Split Set) are much easier to install than mechanical bolts or grouted bolts. The bolt is hammered into the drill hole, which has a smaller diameter than the bolt. Pressure from the bolt on the wall holds the rock together. Friction stabilizers are particularly susceptible to corrosion and rust from water unless they are grouted. Once grouted the friction increases {{by a factor of}} 3-4.|$|E
40|$|Previous work on car-trailer {{stability}} {{has been}} largely limited to theoretical studies with some reference to practical experience or accident statistics. In this study, extensive and systematic experimental investigations were carried out oil a combined car-adjustable-trailer system. The influence of different trailer parameters on the system high-speed stability was examined by changing the mass, dimensions, and inertial characteristics of a fully adjustable trailer. It {{was found that the}} dominant factors affecting stability were the trailer yaw inertia, nose mass (mass distribution), and trailer axle position. The tyre pressure also affects the stability, although this effect is less significant. It is interesting to see that the trailer mass alone does not dramatically affect the high-speed stability, as this runs contrary to current guidelines relating to limits on the relative mass of the car and trailer. Experimental tests on a <b>friction</b> <b>stabilizer</b> and on car electronic stability programs demonstrate that both of these improve the high-speed stability and help to delay the onset of 'snaking'...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{evaluated}} {{corrosion resistance}} of Split Set <b>friction</b> rock <b>stabilizer</b> mine roof bolts {{to aid in}} better prediction of useful service life. Electrochemical corrosion testing was conducted utilizing an automated corrosion measurement system. Natural and/or synthetic mine waters from four uranium and two copper mines were the test media for {{the two types of}} high-strength, low-alloy (HSLA) steels from which Split Set stabilizers are manufactured, and for galvanized steel. Tests were conducted with waters of minimum and maximum dissolved oxygen content at in-mine water temperatures. Retrieved Split Set stabilizers were also evaluated for property changes. Galvanized steel was found to be far superior to the unprotected steel in general corrosion resistance; limited tests indicate little ten. dency to pitting, contrary to behavior for the uncoated steel. Copper-bearing HSLA steel was slightly more corrosion resistant than non-copper-bearing HSLA steel. Statistical analyses resulted in development of equations relating dissolved oxygen, chloride, sulfate, and magnesium contents of mine waters to corrosion rates of the two HSLA steels (nongalvanized). An equation was developed that relates corrosion rates of galvanized steel to mine water temperature and dissolved oxygen content. Variable conditions in mine environments make corrosion damage difficult to predict and emphasize the need for corrosion prevention and control...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to present a {{methodology}} to predict vibrations of drilllstrings for oil recovery service. The work extends a previous model of the drill collar between two stabilizers in the literature to include drill collar flexibility utilizing a modal coordinate condensed, finite element approach. The stiffness due to the gravitational forces along the drillstring axis is included. The model also includes the nonlinear effects of drillstring-wellbore contact, friction and quadratic damping. Bifurcation diagrams are presented to illustrate the effects of speed, <b>friction</b> at wellbore, <b>stabilizer</b> clearance and drill collar length on chaotic vibration response. Their effects shifts resonance peaks away from the linear natural frequency values and influences the onset speed for chaos. A study is conducted on factors for improving the accuracy of Lyapunov Exponents to predict the presence of chaos. This study considers {{the length of time}} to steady state, the number and duration of linearization sub-intervals, the presence of rigid body modes and the number of finite elements and modal coordinates. The Poincare map and frequency spectrum are utilized to confirm the prediction of Lyapunov exponent analysis. The results may be helpful for computing Lyapunov exponents of other types of nonlinear vibrating systems with many degrees of freedom. Vibration response predictions may assist drilling rig operators in changing a variety of controlled parameters to improve operation procedures and/or equipment...|$|R
