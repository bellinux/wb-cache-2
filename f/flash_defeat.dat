50|$|After {{an alien}} {{spacecraft}} crashes into {{the jungles of}} Africa, local gorillas become hyper-intelligent and acquire telepathic abilities. These gorillas form Gorilla City. The city led by Solovar quickly creates technology far surpassing that of humanity and cloaks itself from human society.

Under Nnamdi, Gorilla City has blended its advanced technology with the nature around it and adopted a more isolationist policy than was present during Solovar's reign, as seen in Nnamdi's refusal to allow the Flash to imprison Grodd for his crimes after <b>Flash</b> <b>defeated</b> him, even erasing Wally's memory of the city's location to stop him finding them again (Flash v.2 #194, 2003).|$|R

He continued to plague Jay Garrick for many years, eventually joining with the Thinker and the Shade to remove Keystone City from the world's vision and memory. Barry Allen inadvertently crossed the vibrational barrier the Fiddler created in Grant Morrison's post-Crisis version of the first Jay/Barry team-up, [...] "Flash of Two Cities" [...] in Secret Origins #50 (August 1990).

Despero found out about this by reading the mind of one of the rebels he had tracked down and teleported, though her father and Flash were protected by the dimensional traveller's 'blue glow'. However, the JLA are able to escape all the dangers on the worlds and return to Earth using a dimensional traveler one of Despero's henchmen possesses after the <b>Flash</b> <b>defeats</b> him. Despero has found the rebel and plans to use their energy-absorbing weapon they hoped to use to disable his weapons to conquer Earth, but Snapper Carr uses it to weaken the villain after pretending he has been hypnotized, though the 'blue glow' protected him. Despero is then imprisoned and Kalanor is freed.|$|R

This fan was later revealed to be Flash and was escorted from the building by security while McDevitt had to be carried to the back. Their confrontations referenced alleged real-life animosity between the two in what was essentially a [...] "worked shoot". Flash returned to MCW at Shamrock Cup VI and provoked McDevitt into a fight after attacking his then wife Kim McDevitt. The brawl ended up having the entire MCW locker room enter the ring to pull the two men apart and was eventually stopped by the State Athletic Commission for excessive violence. <b>Flash</b> <b>defeated</b> Julio Dinero later on in the event and used a loophole in the pre-match stipulation to win the MEWF Heavyweight Championship.|$|R
50|$|In {{his first}} Pre-Crisis {{appearance}} {{he met the}} Flash while searching for Solovar, who had been imprisoned, {{during a trip to}} the human world.

Solovar breaks out of his cage and tells the <b>Flash.</b> The <b>Flash</b> <b>defeats</b> Grodd and temporarily removes his telepathy. When his power returns, he escapes and builds a machine to strip his fellow gorillas of their intelligence. The Flash finds out from Solovar where Grodd has escaped and destroys the machine. Grodd is imprisoned again, but uses a burrowing machine he built earlier to escape again. Assuming human form, he creates a drug to strengthen his abilities. After easily stopping the Flash, Grodd experiences a side effect that removes his new powers. The Flash arrests Grodd and takes him back to Gorilla City.

Later, he instigates the Flash's Rogues Gallery, breaking them out of jail to distract the Flash after transferring his mind to that of Freddy, a gorilla in a zoo. Thanks to Solovar, the Flash learns of Grodd's escape. Ironically, Grodd, despite using radiation to negate the <b>Flash's</b> speed, is <b>defeated</b> by the gorilla's mate when she hears him mention another gorilla. He and Freddy are restored to their normal bodies.|$|R
