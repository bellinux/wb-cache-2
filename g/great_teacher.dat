At times it even reached an intensity similar to the personality cult surrounding Kim Il-sung (which Hoxha condemned) with Hoxha being portrayed as a genius commenting on virtually all facets of life from culture to economics to military matters. Each schoolbook required one or more quotations from him on the subjects being studied. The Party honored him with titles such as Supreme Comrade, Sole Force and <b>Great</b> <b>Teacher.</b>|$|E

25|$|At the 1980 NBA All-Star Game, league owners {{voted to}} admit the new team, with the team's name coming from the 1957–1962 TV western Maverick; the name was chosen by the fans with 4,600 postcards received, beating Wranglers and Express. James Garner, who played the namesake character, {{was a member of}} the {{ownership}} group. The University of Texas at Arlington, who also uses the Mavericks nickname, had objections about a shared name, but did not attempt any legal action. They joined the Midwest Division of the Western Conference, where they would stay until the league went to six divisions for the 2004–05 season. Dick Motta, who had guided the Washington Bullets to the NBA Championship in 1977–78, was hired as the team's first head coach. He had a well-earned reputation of being a stern disciplinarian, but was also a <b>great</b> <b>teacher</b> of the game.|$|E
25|$|Some {{insights}} on Vladimir Becić {{can be derived}} from his self-portraits, which he painted from his youngest days until just before his death. They are especially remarkable as they cover his time in Munich, then Paris and finally Osijek. Compared to the contemporary self-portraits of Joseph Racic and Miroslav Kraljevic, the Becic self-portraits are simpler, but show a full and complete expression. His early paintings, above all, show an accurate observation of form, subject and body and their spatial relationships rendered by a trained and skilful hand. The style of his later work owes something to the widespread tendency in Europe to return to nature in all things cultural and artistic after the First World War, and the influence of post-cubism - emphasizing the importance of construction. For Becić, nature was not a shelter, but an incentive, a <b>great</b> <b>teacher</b> of life, order, organization.|$|E

25|$|It was in 1891 {{that many}} of Petipa's {{original}} ballets, revivals, and dances from operas began to be notated in the method of dance notation created by Vladimir Stepanov. The project began with a demonstration to the committee of the Imperial Ballet (consisting of Petipa, Lev Ivanov, the former Prima Ballerina Ekaterina Vazem, the former premier danseur Pavel Gerdt, and the <b>great</b> <b>teacher</b> Christian Johansson) with Stepanov himself notating Lev Ivanov and Riccardo Drigo's 1893 ballet La Flûte magique, and not long afterward the project was set into motion with a revival of Jules Perrot's ballet Le rêve du peintre. After Stepanov's death in 1896 Alexander Gorsky took over the project, all the while perfecting the system. After Gorsky departed St. Petersburg in 1900 {{to take up the}} post of Balletmaster to the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre, the project was taken over by Nicholas Sergeyev, former Danseur of the Imperial Ballet (and later régisseur in 1903) with his team of notators – Alexander Chekrygin joined the project in 1903, and Victor Rakhmanov in 1904.|$|E
25|$|In the Indian {{education}} system, a teacher’s {{success is}} loosely defined. It is either {{based on a}} student’s success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher’s skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, {{both of which are}} often not an indicator of a good teacher. This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a <b>great</b> <b>teacher</b> may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, {{there is a need to}} identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.|$|E

500|$|Dhumavati {{is said to}} {{manifest}} herself {{at the time of}} cosmic dissolution (pralaya) and is [...] "the Void" [...] that exists before creation and after dissolution. While Dhumavati is generally associated with only inauspicious qualities, her thousand-name hymn relates her positive aspects as well as her negative ones. She is often called tender-hearted and a bestower of boons. Dhumavati is described as a <b>great</b> <b>teacher,</b> one who reveals ultimate knowledge of the universe, which is beyond the illusory divisions, like auspicious and inauspicious. Her ugly form teaches the devotee to look beyond the superficial, to look inwards and seek the inner truths of life.|$|E

500|$|As an {{ancestor}} or Grandmother spirit, she embodies a <b>great</b> <b>teacher</b> and guide, granting {{knowledge of the}} ultimate truth of life and death. Her smoke hides that which is obvious, revealing hidden secrets and truths of [...] "the unknown and the unmanifest". Frawley says her outer appearance as poverty is deceptive and a mere illusion that hides the inner reality. She is [...] "the good fortune that comes {{to us in the}} form of misfortune". Dhumavati embodies the [...] "power of suffering". Through the negative aspects that Dhumavati represents rise the virtues of patience, persistence, forgiveness, and detachment. Without the revealing of this negativity of life, it cannot be transcended and the secret truths would remain hidden under the smoky veil of illusion.|$|E
500|$|The Baltimore Orioles signed Ripken in 1957. The scout {{who signed}} {{him to his}} first minor league contract, which was for $150 a month, {{did not have a}} pen and had to borrow one from a spectator. He began his 36-year tenure in the {{organization}} as the starting catcher for the Phoenix Stars of the Class C Arizona–Mexico League. Ripken recalled, [...] "At Phoenix, my manager was Bob Hooper, who also pitched. He was a <b>great</b> <b>teacher</b> and threw the best stiff-wrist slider I ever saw. Bob used so much resin that after a game when I'd congratulate him, our hands would stick together." [...] Next year, he was promoted to the Wilson Tobs of the Class B Carolina League, where he played 118 games. In 1959, he split the season between the Pensacola Dons of the Class D Alabama–Florida League and the Amarillo Gold Sox of the Texas League. Most of his playing time came in 61 games with Pensecola; he only appeared in 30 games for Amarillo.|$|E
500|$|Another early {{influence}} was William Morris. In Vaughan Williams's words, [...] "It was now that Holst discovered {{the feeling of}} unity with his fellow men which made him afterwards a <b>great</b> <b>teacher.</b> A sense of comradeship rather than political conviction led him, while still a student, to join the Kelmscott House Socialist Club in Hammersmith." [...] At Kelmscott House, Morris's home, Holst attended lectures by his host and Bernard Shaw. His own socialism was moderate in character, but he enjoyed the club for its good company and his admiration of Morris as a man. His ideals were influenced by Morris's but had a different emphasis. Morris had written, [...] "I do not want art for a few any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few. I want all persons to be educated according to their capacity, not according {{to the amount of}} money which their parents happen to have". Holst said, [...] "'Aristocracy in art'—art is not for all but only for the chosen few—but the only way to find those few is to bring art to everyone—then the artists have a sort of masonic signal by which they recognise each other in the crowd." [...] He was invited to conduct the Hammersmith Socialist Choir, teaching them madrigals by Thomas Morley, choruses by Purcell, and works by Mozart, Wagner and himself. One of his choristers was (Emily) Isobel Harrison (1876–1969), a beautiful soprano two years his junior. He fell in love with her; she was at first unimpressed by him, but she came round and they were engaged, though with no immediate prospect of marriage given Holst's tiny income.|$|E
