500|$|... "Immortality" [...] was {{watched by}} about 3.7 million viewers, drawing a 1.4/4 ratings share on its initial broadcast, down 12.5 {{percent from the}} {{previous}} episode's viewership. During the first half hour, the episode placed second in its timeslot, but dropped to fourth for its second half. Its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, also dropped 12 percent, as did all other network shows for that night. Time shifting viewing added 57 percent to the episode's ratings for three days out, and 64 percent for a week following the first airing. This was the greatest DVR gain yet for the series in that timeslot. Despite this, Joshua Jackson urged fans to watch the series live {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly a week after [...] "Immortality" [...] aired. He explained [...] "I'm a positive person in general, but we really need our Fringe fans to tune in and watch us on Fridays. We did good when we first moved, but last week we did not have a <b>good</b> <b>week,</b> ratings wise. It is going to take the people that like the show to watch the show and start the campaign and show their support if they want to see us stick around for another season." ...|$|E

50|$|In 2011, Network Ten {{announced}} {{they would be}} resting the <b>Good</b> News <b>Week</b> panel format and introducing a skit-based spin-off titled Good News World. McDermott, Robins and Hooper returned as regular cast members, along with <b>Good</b> News <b>Week</b> regulars Tom Gleeson, Akmal Saleh, Cal Wilson, Sammy J and Randy.

6000|$|DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,--This is a <b>good</b> <b>week</b> for me. I {{stopped in}} the Herald office as I came through New York, to see the boys on the staff, and young James Gordon Bennett asked me to write twice a week, impersonally, for the Herald, and said if I would I might have full swing, and (write) about anybody and {{everybody}} I wanted to. I said I must have the very fullest possible swing, and he said [...] "all right." [...] I said [...] "It's a contract--" [...] and that settled that matter.|$|E
60|$|Now {{and then}} he spent a little, but not often. He was desperately fond of sponge-cakes, and occasionally, when {{he had had a}} <b>good</b> <b>week,</b> he would indulge himself to the extent of one or two. But he hated paying for them, and always made a frantic and {{frequently}} successful effort to get off with the cake and the penny also. His plan of operations was simple. He would walk into the shop with his penny in his mouth, well displayed, and a sweet and lamblike expression in his eyes. Taking his stand as near to the cakes as he could get, and fixing his eyes affectionately upon them, he would begin to whine, and the shopkeeper, thinking he was dealing with an honest dog, would throw him one.|$|E

60|$|Ham Spink {{was indeed}} in a sorry plight. The smell {{was so bad}} that none of his friends wanted to go near him, and they begged him to keep his distance. In anger he stalked back to his camp, and there took off the almost ruined suit and buried it in the ground for forty-eight hours, which removed the worst of the odor. Following the advice given, he washed himself in a mud paste, {{allowing}} the mud to dry on him at the heat of the fire. Later he washed the mud off and used some heavily scented toilet soap, and thus removed the worst of the odor from his person. But it was a <b>good</b> <b>week</b> before he felt as clean as he had previous to the encounter with the obnoxious animal.|$|E
60|$|Oh, let us {{contemplate}} {{this week}} Christ on His Cross, sacrificing Himself {{for us and}} all mankind; and may that sight help to cast out of us all laziness and selfishness, and make us vow obedience {{to the spirit of}} self- sacrifice, the Spirit of Christ and of God, which was given to us at our baptism. And let us give, as we are most bound, in all humility and contrition of heart, thanks, praise, and adoration, to that immortal Lamb, who abideth for ever {{in the midst of the}} throne of God, the Lamb slain before the foundation of the world, by Whom all things consist; and Who in this week died on the Cross in mortal flesh and blood, that He might make this a <b>good</b> <b>week</b> to all mankind, and teach selfish man that only by being unselfish can he too be good; and only by self-sacrifice become perfect, even as The Father in heaven is perfect.|$|E

And people are so unreasonable.--Only this morning, among other things, when you got your order {{to go on with}} your single study, I received a letter from a woman, an old friend whom I can scarcely refuse, begging me as a great favour to design her a set of theatrical costumes, in which she and her friends can perform for some charity. It would occupy me a <b>good</b> <b>week</b> to go into the subject and do the thing properly. Such are the sort of letters I get. I wish, George, you could knock out something for her before you leave town. It is positively impossible for me to do it with all this work in hand, and these eternal fogs to contend against.' ...|$|E
