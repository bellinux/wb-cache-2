5|$|The Red Spot was {{reportedly}} lost <b>from</b> <b>sight</b> {{on several occasions}} between 1665 and 1708 before becoming quite conspicuous in 1878. It was recorded as fading again in 1883 and {{at the start of}} the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|In 1801, the {{astronomer}} Giuseppe Piazzi discovered an object which he initially {{believed to be}} a comet. Shortly thereafter he announced his observations of this object, noting that the slow, uniform motion was uncharacteristic of a comet, suggesting it was a different type of object. This was lost <b>from</b> <b>sight</b> for several months, but was recovered later that year by the Baron von Zach and Heinrich W. M. Olbers after a preliminary orbit was computed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This object came to be named Ceres, and was the first asteroid to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{meteoroid}} grazed Earth's atmosphere quite gently (in comparison to, for example, the 1972Great Daylight Fireball {{above the}} United States and Canada). It became visible north of Uherský Brod, Czechoslovakia, at {{a height of}} 103.7km, approaching the Earth's surface to 98.67km northeast of Wrocław, Poland, and disappearing <b>from</b> <b>sight</b> at a height of 100.4km north of Poznań, Poland. It would probably still have been visible until it reached a height of 110km above the southern Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|After the 'panic party' {{had taken}} to the boats and the ship {{appeared}} to be sinking, the U-boat approached to within 80 yards of her port quarter, whereupon Sanders ordered the White Ensign hoisted and Prize opened fire. Within {{a few minutes the}} submarine was on fire and her bows rose in the air, whilst Prize was further damaged. The U-boat disappeared <b>from</b> <b>sight,</b> and was believed to have been sunk by the crew of Prize and by several of the German crew (including her captain) who had been blown or jumped into the sea. However, neither of the crippled ships had sunk, with Prize being towed in flames back to Kinsale. U-93 struggled back to the Sylt nine days later.|$|E

40|$|Extinctions {{of plant}} and animal species are rarely {{observed}} directly and must be inferred <b>from</b> <b>sighting</b> or collection records. The inference about extinction that can be drawn <b>from</b> a <b>sighting</b> record depends on the sighting rate. Existing methods assume that the form of the sighting rate is known and may be sensitive to deviations from the assumed form. A simple nonparametric test is proposed that makes minimal assumptions about the sighting rate. The test is illustrated by application to collection records of nine Mauritian orchid species...|$|R

The saved approach clasping their hands in prayer, and are greeted at the entrance by an angel. Only a few souls pass through the heavenly gates at a time. The imagery of a church as an earthly representation of Heaven was popularised in the 13th century by theologians such as Durandus; the gate to Heaven in this work resembles {{the entrance to the}} Beaune hospice. The way to Heaven is shown clearly as a gilded church– the saved ascend a set of steps, turn right, and disappear <b>from</b> <b>sight.</b> It is fully enclosed in a single panel, whereas Hell extends onto the adjoining panel, perhaps hinting that sin contaminates all around it.|$|E
5|$|Mark Rathbun {{spent only}} {{four days in}} the Hole in 2004 but says that he left after seeing his old friend Tom De Vocht being {{physically}} beaten by Miscavige. According to Rathbun, one night the incarcerated executives were ordered to jog to a building 400 yards away and back. As they were herded back to their office-prison, he broke away and hid in bushes until the group had disappeared <b>from</b> <b>sight.</b> He retrieved his motorcycle, hid in the brush and drove out through the Gold Base gates when they were opened to let a car in. He subsequently rented a car and spent a month touring the South before settling in southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|On 16 February, {{the victorious}} British fleet and its prizes entered the bay. Jervis ordered the three frigates—Emerald, , and , of 40 and 32 guns respectively—to {{search for the}} {{disabled}} flagship, Santisima Trinidad, which had been towed from the battle. Two smaller craft—Bonne-Citoyenne, a corvette of 20 guns, and the 14-gun sloop —joined the frigates. The British squadron on 20 February sighted Santissima Trinidad under tow by a large frigate and {{in the company of}} a brig. Berkeley, considering the small squadron under his command insufficient, declined to engage and eventually the Spanish ships sailed <b>from</b> <b>sight.</b> The 32-gun , while cruising alone, later located Santissima Trinidad and engaged her but the out-gunned British frigate was forced to abandon her attack.|$|E

5|$|Four {{years after}} the Brood War, the Dominion is once again the {{dominant}} Terran power in the Koprulu sector. News reports reveal that {{in the four years}} {{since the end of the}} Brood Wars, the standing Dominion military forces have been reduced and defense budget has instead been diverted to hunting down rebel forces that operate against the Dominion. For reasons unknown, Kerrigan gathered the swarm at Char and then vanished <b>from</b> <b>sight.</b> With the Zerg gone, the Protoss have once again taken a passive role in the galaxy. Jim Raynor has formed a revolutionary group named Raynor's Raiders in order to overthrow Dominion Emperor Arcturus Mengsk. On Mar Sara, Raynor meets with an old comrade, Tychus Findlay. Together, they liberate the local population from Dominion control and also discover a component of a mysterious Xel'Naga artifact. As the Zerg begin to overrun Mar Sara, Raynor arranges an evacuation to his battlecruiser, the Hyperion, captained by Matt Horner, Raynor's second-in-command.|$|E

A magistrate with ius augurium (the right of augury) could declare the suspension of all official business for the day (obnuntiato) if he deemed the omens unfavourable.

A small amount of plant food is eaten, mainly seeds. Woodcock are crepuscular, being most active at dawn and dusk.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{majority}} of the interviewed witnesses, the airplane suddenly rolled to the left until the wings were perpendicular to the ground. The aircraft then descended in a nose-down attitude and disappeared <b>from</b> <b>sight</b> behind trees near the airport. One witness told investigators that they saw a puff of smoke emanate from the aircraft prior to or subsequent to the airplane rolling to the left. Others reported loud engine noises described as a squeal, whine, or an overspeeding or accelerating engine during the last moments of the flight, although they said that these noises seemed to have stopped, or at least faded before the aircraft impacted with flat ground two miles short of the runway.|$|E
25|$|Last week, Frank Hawks {{shuttled}} to East Aurora, N. Y. to {{show off}} his polliwog to a prospect, Sportsman J. Hazard Campbell. He landed neatly on the polo field in a nearby estate at about 5 p.m., climbed out, chatted awhile with Prospect Campbell and a cluster of friends. Presently he and Campbell took off smartly, cleared a fence, went atilt between two tall trees, and passed <b>from</b> <b>sight.</b> Then there was a rending crash, a smear of flame, silence. Half a mile the fearful group raced from the polo field. From the crackling wreck they pulled Frank Hawks; from beneath a burning wing, Prospect Campbell — both fatally hurt. The ship that could not stub its toe aground had tripped on overhead telephone wires.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other invisibility cloaks {{known to}} exist, this is uniquely a true invisibility cloak, {{in that it}} is able to {{completely}} shield the wearer and others <b>from</b> <b>sight</b> and cannot be worn out by time or spells; other cloaks will lose their ability to conceal the wearer over time or become worn out, but the Hallow cloak will never fade or become damaged. At the end of Deathly Hallows, Dumbledore explains to Harry the Cloak's true magic is it can shield and protect others as well as its owner. This is apparent when it does not respond to a Death Eater's Summoning Charm while concealing Harry, Ron and Hermione in Deathly Hallows. Hermione claims that this is the Hallow she would choose, citing the usefulness Harry has found of it.|$|E
