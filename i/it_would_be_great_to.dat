Similar in intent to Star Wars, he created [...] "a number of well-known mythological situations for a young audience". During the production of Return of the Jedi in 1982, Lucas approached Warwick Davis, who was portraying Wicket the Ewok, about playing Willow Ufgood. Five years passed before he was actually cast in the role. Lucas [...] "thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> use a little person in a lead role.

500|$|In July 2010, Feargus Urquhart, {{replying}} to {{an interview}} question about what franchises {{he would like to}} work on, said that [...] "if [...] could come across everything that [...] played", he would choose a Chrono Trigger game. At the time, Urquhart's company Obsidian Entertainment was making Dungeon Siege III for Square Enix. Urquhart said: [...] "You make RPGs, we make RPGs, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> see what we could do together. And they really wanted to start getting into Western RPGs. And, so it kind of all ended up fitting together." [...] Yoshinori Kitase revealed in 2011 that he used the time travel mechanics of Chrono Trigger {{as a starting point for}} that of Final Fantasy XIII-2.|$|E
500|$|In December 2007, Record Collector {{published}} {{an interview with}} Ray Davies in which he said, [...] "I spoke to Quaife {{about a month ago}} and he dearly wants to make another record with me. I think Dave's getting better and Mick's still playing. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> get back together just to see what musical ideas we had, and what would happen." [...] The Daily Mail subsequently interpreted his comments as a declaration that a reunion of the band's original line-up was imminent. Dave Davies swiftly rejected the idea of a reunion. He told a reporter that [...] "it would be like a bad remake of Night of the Living Dead" [...] and added, [...] "Ray has been doing Karaoke Kinks shows since 1996." ...|$|E

You get to whoop and twitch. Any other good ones?" [...] A passing blind man accidentally taps her with his cane, and Ling cries, [...] "OW! [...] They're not weapons!...I so prefer the deaf to the blind." [...] Ling will even impersonate the blind to get her way. In one episode she puts on sunglasses, extends a telescoping white cane, and walks across a busy street, [...] tires squealing as she hits a couple of cars with her cane. [...] Ling is unapologetic for these affronts. When pointed out that [...] "there are real blind people in the world", Ling retorts, [...] "It's not like any of them saw me." ...|$|E

500|$|IGN {{gave the}} games a 9/10, a higher rating {{than any of}} the other Nintendo DS Pokémon games. The review praised the games for {{renewing}} interest in the series, though criticized some of the new Pokémon designs, explaining that [...] "aside from a weaker lineup of monsters (largely an aesthetic complaint), this is the best Pokémon has to offer on every level, renewing my waning interest in monster battling". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized Black and White, commenting that he grew tired of it shortly after starting and feeling like it was too similar to all previous Pokémon games. He further went on to say that EVs and IVs, invisible mechanics in the game, are not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, he noted that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> new players. He also compared it to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games and Final Fantasy XIII, arguing that they all share the common element of being bad before they get good. Fellow Retronauts contributor Justin Haywald criticized the games' release on the DS, which had received two main Pokémon series games published before them. GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson stated [...] "It may not break the Pokemon mold, but Black/White offers enough new content coupled with the series' classic, deep battle mechanics to make it endlessly playable. If you could only play one game for the rest of your life, this would be a wise choice." ...|$|E
500|$|Sigourney Weaver has {{expressed}} interest in reuniting with Ridley Scott to revive her character for another Alien film. In the 2003 commentary track for the Alien DVD included in the Alien Quadrilogy set, she and Scott both speculated on the possibility, with Weaver stating: [...] "There is an appetite for a fifth one, which is something I never expected...it's really hard {{to come up with}} a fifth story that's new and fresh...but I have wanted to go back into space...I think outer space adventure is a good thing for us right now, 'cause Earth is so grim...so we've been talking about it, but very generally." [...] Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the most logical course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the Aliens. Weaver supported this idea, saying [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> go back, because I'm asked that question so many times: 'Where did the Alien come from?' People really want to know in a very visceral way." [...] David Giler said that he, Walter Hill, and Gordon Carroll, the producers of the first four films in the series, would not be willing to produce another unless it was about the Aliens' homeworld and Weaver was on board (despite the fact that they were among the producers of Alien vs. Predator films). Weaver, in turn, indicated that she would only return to the franchise if either Scott or James Cameron were to direct. Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth Alien film which would explore the origins of the creatures, but ceased work on it when he learned that Fox was pursuing Alien vs. Predator, which he felt would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise".|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace producer, Tim Kaiser, in an {{interview}} with The New York Times, said that the doll's appearance was not any kind of [...] "forced" [...] product placement, as some speculated, explaining, [...] "It was just a natural fit, because Jack's affection for Cher is a thread that is running through the show already." [...] Kaiser continued saying that NBC [...] "saw the strength" [...] of the episode's storyline and understood that [...] "if a Cher doll is in the show that much, it's {{an integral part of the}} episode." [...] Kaiser said that [...] "Gypsies, Tramps and Weed" [...] writer Katie Palmer [...] "originally didn't know" [...] Mattel planned to market a Cher doll and learned about it after working on the script. Curt King, a spokesman for NBC, further commented that the doll's role in the episode was due to the producers thinking of [...] "a lot of humor [...] would come out of it." [...] Mark Malinowski, senior vice president and director at Ketchum Entertainment Marketing, revealed that Mattel was launching the Cher doll and in a [...] "brainstorming meeting" [...] they mentioned Will & Grace as the Jack character in love with Cher. [...] "We thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> try to include the doll in a plot line of an episode because it would be organic, playing off something that already exists. I don't think any viewer will see this and think 'product placement.' [...] It's strategic for the product and relevant for the audience, particularly the gay men who watch the show because the characters of Jack and Will are gay." [...] It was also noted that Mattel did not pay a fee to the show's producers or NBC to have the Cher doll appear in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|Irwin {{said in an}} {{interview}} in 2000 that the greatest disappointment of his career was not at the British Open, but at the 1984 U.S. Open at Winged Foot. Irwin had led the tournament after the first three rounds, but shot a final round of 79 to finish 6th. Reflecting on his final round collapse, Irwin said: [...] "A number of factors were in play and it was very emotional. I thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> win 10 years later at the same venue and, more than anything else, my father was dying of cancer then and I thought it would be wonderful to give him a victory.

2500|$|Soon after The Office premiered, Fischer {{was focused}} on the show's success; in an April 2005 {{interview}} with her alma mater's student newspaper, she said: [...] "Honestly <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> get to play Pam for a long, long time .... I don't have real big aspirations to be a movie star. I would love to be on a long-running hit TV show. You end up playing a defining role." [...] As The Office grew into a success, Fischer's film acting career became more established. In 2006, she co-starred in her then-husband's film, Slither, and in 2007, she filmed supporting roles in The Brothers Solomon, with Will Arnett and Will Forte, Blades of Glory, with Will Ferrell, John Heder, Amy Poehler and Will Arnett, and , alongside John C.

It was recorded, like its predecessor, with The Philharmonia Orchestra at AIR Studios in London, while the soundtrack was first unveiled on 28 October 2010 at St Mary's Church, Nottingham where Hannigan performed several tracks with the Pinewood Singers. The main theme for the soundtrack was made available for download on the games official website on 8 November 2010. Hannigan described the music from the game as dark, [...] " [...] largely following similar changes in the underlying story – but is not without its lighter moments".|$|E
2500|$|By 1951, the 64-year-old Frawley had {{appeared}} in over 100 movies, but was starting to find film role offers becoming fewer. When he heard that Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball were casting a new television situation comedy, he applied eagerly {{to play the role}} of the cantankerous, miserly landlord Fred Mertz. [...] One evening he telephoned Lucille Ball, asking her what his chances were. Ball was surprised to hear from him — a man she barely knew. Both Ball and Arnaz agreed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> have Frawley, a motion picture veteran, appear as Fred Mertz. Less enthusiastic were CBS executives, who warned of Frawley's frequent drinking and instability. Arnaz immediately told Frawley about the network's concerns, telling him that if he was late to work, arrived drunk, or was unable to perform because of something other than legitimate illness more than once, he would be written out of the show. Contrary to the network's concerns, Frawley never arrived at work drunk, and in fact mastered his lines after only one reading. Arnaz eventually became one of the misanthropic Frawley's few close friends.|$|E

She commented, [...] "It would be great fun to get all the Butcher clan back for a few months. I hear Diane's name mentioned quite a lot on the show — it makes me feel like I've never really left. But all the people I'm connected with are leaving, which makes going back harder and I'm really sorry about that. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> have the Butcher clan come back for Mike's sendoff.
