40|$|There {{the study}} object is the {{supporting}} structure of <b>van</b> <b>body</b> of passenger type, {{which was made}} in the aluminium alloys. The purposes are to develop the measures to improve the supporting structure of <b>van</b> <b>body</b> in the aluminium alloys for the high-speed electric train, to create the mathematical simulators to estimate the stressed-strained state of body. The design procedure of supporting structure of <b>van</b> <b>body</b> of passenger type by parts on the basis of direct algorithm of combination of interlacing methods of main systems and of finite members during the separation of force by the Finite Element Method (FMM) of body by two parts has been developed. The extended design scheme of FMM of <b>van</b> <b>body</b> in the aluminium alloys for the high-speed electric train has been offered. The measures to increase the stiffness of <b>van</b> <b>bodies</b> of passenger type, which were made in the aluminium alloys, have been developed. The construction variant of <b>van</b> <b>body</b> in the aluminium alloys for the high-speed electric train, which provides for the necessary stiffness at the decrease of metal consumption of body, has been offered. The recommendations to increase the stiffness of body have been used at the Riga Van Works during the finishing of design of van of high-speed electric train. The application fields are the van-building works (the designing of outlook van constructions of passenger type) Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The three {{dimensional}} {{model of}} a <b>van</b> <b>body</b> truck is established, and then the aerodynamic characteristics of the truck is analyzed using finite element method with ANSYS software.

40|$|Isolates of Phytophthora cinnamomi {{obtained}} from trees treated with phosphonate, or untreated, for a prolonged period, were evaluated for sensitivity towards Fosetyl-AI and H 3 PO 3, {{as determined by}} inhibition of growth in vitro.

Monitoring should therefore continue.
