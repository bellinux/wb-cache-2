40|$|International audienceAs {{a result}} of an {{increasing}} industrial demand for very small parts, this paper proposes an extension of the concept of forming limit diagrams for very thin sheets (thicknesses of 0. 1 mm) called micro-forming limit diagrams (MFLD). A specific drawing tool of small size was designed and subsequently achieved in the laboratory. The formability of a rolled and annealed 1050 A aluminum sheet (99. 5 %) was characterized and analyzed. Seeing the size of the specimen and the tool, the spacer is replaced by a central <b>electro-discharged</b> smaller thickness. The micro-forming press was coupled with a system for strain measurements based on image analysis with a correlation method. After experimental tests with 7 different geometries, the strains were determined {{at the beginning of the}} necking from the various images. Based on this, three methods of determination of the MFLD were proposed (white pixel emergence, polynomial method and strain profile analysis) and compared. Finally, an experimental deep drawing cylindrical cup test rendered it possible to validate the most accurate method for determining the micro-forming limit diagram...|$|R

5000|$|Firstly, {{reference}} bushes {{are attached}} to the front and back surfaces of the component at the measurement location, to minimise [...] "bell-mouthing" [...] and assist with aligning the data sets during analysis. A reference hole is then drilled through a component; in engineering metals, a gun-drill is typically used due to the smooth and straight hole profile they produce. After drilling, the diameter of the reference hole is measured at frequent intervals along the full length and circumference of the measurement and reference bushes with an air probe. This is a thin rod with pressurised air forced from the end via two small holes at a normal to the reference hole axis. As the air probe is moved through the hole, changes in hole diameter will result in changes in pressure, which are detected with a calibrated transducer to convert the pressure change into a voltage. A cylinder (i.e. a core) of material containing the reference hole along its axis is then cut (trepanned) from the component using <b>electro-discharge</b> machining (EDM), in order to relax the stresses acting on the reference hole. Finally, the diameter of the reference hole is re-measured through the entire thickness of the cylinder and reference bushes, with the diameter measurements taken at the same locations as those measured prior to the trepanning.|$|E

40|$|The {{operating}} efficiency of an <b>Electro-discharge</b> (ED) machine is {{strongly influenced by}} the gap-width controller. For the multiple cases in which ED-machining is used in practice the gap width controller has to provide a stable and efficient removal process.

As consequence of this fact a flutter movement of the electrode often may be observed. In case of finishing even micromo-tions influences the removal rates because of the very small geometrical gap width. Therefore a gap-width controller was developed which uses the relative frequency of short circuits and open circuits during an inspected period as input values.
