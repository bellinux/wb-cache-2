6000|$|... "It is not {{his health}} which frightens me. I am sure--I am quite sure that he has {{something}} upon his mind. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> nothing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> of the imp {{behind the}} log {{and of the}} miserable devil who went over the fall--or of the wretch in the tree?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> say?" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Cliff. [...] "What are {{his reasons}} for staying away? What <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about his plans? Read us the letter. You can leave out all the loving and {{confidential}} parts, but give us his explanations. I never was so anxious to know anything in all my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Simply <b>do</b> what <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you,</b> {{whether it}} is wrong or right. If it's right, {{it ought to be}} done, and if it's wrong, it will not be your fault." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad, {{for my own}} sake, {{that he is not}} {{so black}} as he is painted," [...] said Agatha. [...] "You may believe every word of it, Mr. Erskine. Be sure to <b>do</b> as <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you.</b> <b>He</b> is quite certain to be right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so glad William is coming. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that he sent}} me his manuscript? I think it's wonderful--I think he's almost {{good enough}} for you, Katharine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> dear?" [...] Mrs. Gildersleeve asked, {{with that}} frightened air, as of a startled wild thing, growing deeper than ever upon her countenance as she uttered the question.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it not plain now," [...] cried Lu-don, [...] "that this {{creature}} is no god. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that he was}} the son of god?" [...] he almost shouted, turning suddenly upon Pan-at-lee.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll Trafford him," [...] {{said the}} Liberator and he struck {{the table with}} his hammer. [...] "He ducks my {{messenger}} <b>does</b> <b>he?</b> I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> I'll have fire for that water," [...] and he looked around {{him as if he}} courted some remonstrance in order that he might crush it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mac, {{listen to}} me," [...] Rose said very earnestly, though her voice {{shook a little}} and her heart ached. [...] "You know you have hurt your eyes reading by fire-light and in the dusk, and sitting up late, and now you'll {{have to pay for}} it; the doctor said so. You must be careful, and <b>do</b> as <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you,</b> or you will be blind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was sure}} of it," [...] he groaned. [...] "The fellow is {{returning}} to make himself a nuisance to me. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> his story, then, Mr. Thain?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{as though}} it were a thing of course. But I noticed it. It was not when he bade me poke the fire, but the next time. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about the fire?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! that is right! Well done, my brave de Marmont! Braver {{than your}} treacherous kinsman ever was! So you saw him, did you, Bertrand? <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{that he had}} just come from Genappe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well, it's not important," [...] Jim replied. [...] "Perhaps {{my books}} roused his curiosity. They {{were not the}} books he'd imagine a {{telegraph}} linesman would read. But <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> much about himself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} say that, dear," [...] the {{sergeant}} said. [...] "We must all do our duty, even when that duty {{is hard to}} do, and your duty will be to obey the squire's orders, and to <b>do</b> as <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you.</b> I have no doubt he will be very kind, and {{that you will be}} very happy with him, and I hope he will let you see me sometimes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so {{he means}} to live here altogether, <b>does</b> <b>he?</b> I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what it is,--I won't have it. He's better able to keep a house over his own head and his wife's than I am {{to do it for}} them, and so <b>you</b> may <b>tell</b> them. I won't have it. D'ye hear?" [...] Then there was another short pause. [...] "D'ye hear?" [...] he shouted at her.|$|R
5000|$|In June, 2006, the {{training}} facility at Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio was renamed the Hackney Training Complex. The facility has space to train up to 1,200 people, {{and a staff}} of 50. His widow, Carole Hackney Bergstrom, said about the dedication: [...] "I just wish he could see this. I think he'd really be proud of what <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> <b>He</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> 'All this stuff wasn't necessary. I was just doing my job.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perfectly, perfectly," [...] {{returned}} the girl, breathing with difficulty, in her surprise. [...] "But what of him? <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> to mount this rock?--he knows nothing, himself; for the oath I gave my uncle has shut my mouth." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Hastings laughed. [...] "Harry Wyllard bloodless! My dear, can't you {{see that}} the {{restraint}} he now and then practises is {{the sign of a}} tremendous vitality? Still, the man's mad. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that he means to leave Gregory in charge of Willow Range?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I do," [...] said Mrs. Cliff. [...] "I {{remember}} him very well, and I always thought {{him to be}} a remarkably nice man! But where did you see him, and what in the world <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> to throw you into such a flurry?" ...|$|E
60|$|Household duties.—Love of work.—The old river hand, what <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{and what}} <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>he</b> has done.—Scepticism {{of the new}} generation.—Early boating recollections.—Rafting.—George does the thing in style.—The old boatman, his method.—So calm, so full of peace.—The beginner.—Punting.—A sad accident.—Pleasures of friendship.—Sailing, my first experience.—Possible reason why we were not drowned.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{take him}} out," [...] said Raddy. [...] "He's not shown at all what's in him. The blamed hayseed {{is up in}} the air. He's crazy. He doesn't know what <b>he's</b> <b>doing.</b> I <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> Con, <b>he</b> may be scared to death, but he's dead in earnest." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am almost {{ashamed to}} remark upon the tergiversations and prevarications perpetually ringing {{the changes in}} this declaration. He would not have {{discovered}} this hundred thousand pounds, {{if he could have}} concealed it: he would have discovered it, lest malicious persons should be telling tales of it. He has a system of concealment: he never discovers anything, but when he thinks it can be forced from him. He says, indeed, [...] "I could conceal these things forever, but my conscience would not give me leave": but it is guilt, and not honesty of conscience, that always prompts him. At one time it is the malice of people and the fear of misrepresentation which induced him to make the disclosure; and he values himself on the precaution which this fear had suggested to him. At another time it is the magnitude of the sum which produced this effect: nothing but the impossibility of concealing it could possibly have made him discover it. This hundred thousand pounds he declares he would have concealed, if he could; and yet he values himself upon the discovery of it. Oh, my Lords, I am afraid that sums of much greater magnitude have not been discovered at all! Your Lordships now see some of the artifices of this letter. You see the variety of styles he adopts, and how he turns himself into every shape and every form. But, after all, do you find any clear discovery? do you find any satisfactory answer to the Directors' letter? <b>does</b> <b>he</b> once <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> from whom <b>he</b> received the money? <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> for what <b>he</b> received it, what the circumstances of the persons giving it were, or any explanation whatever of his mode of accounting for it? No: and here, at last, after so many years' litigation, he is called to account for his prevaricating, false accounts in Calcutta, and cannot give them to you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Mr. Dunham {{has been}} talking me over with you, has he? What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> of me? There is nobody like a true friend for dealing an underhand blow at one's reputation. Wait till you hear my account of Dunham! What did he say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come to me, Madeline, and sit here. We shall talk better then." [...] And {{the mother}} made room {{beside her on}} the sofa for her daughter, and Madeline, running over, leaned with her head upon her mother's shoulder. [...] "Well, darling; what did he say? <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that he loved you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thy sacred duty, sayest thou?" [...] Fury blazed {{out of him}} again. [...] "Good God! What a {{generation}} of vipers do we live in! Thy sacred duty, rogue, is to thy King and to God. But let it pass. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> whom it was that you were desired to succour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see. He {{set limits}} of {{prudence}} upon his confession. He left out his Judatting practices. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> for instance, that this deletion {{was an act}} of revenge against me who refused to marry him, having discovered his unfaith, and fearing its consequences in this world and the next." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never. Do {{not tell}} him that I forgive him. I command <b>you</b> not to <b>tell</b> him that. Tell him,--tell him, that I hate him, and that if I ever meet him, I will look at him so that he shall never forget it. I could,--oh! --you {{do not know what}} I could <b>do.</b> <b>Tell</b> me;--did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> to say that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not love me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She did, did she? If {{she speaks}} of it again, {{tell her that}} she is right, that it will never <b>do.</b> Had <b>he</b> not come down to Ongar Park, I should not have {{mentioned}} this to you. I should not have thought that he had in truth any such schemes in his head. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>he</b> had been there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{found him}} {{shot through the}} neck, and dying--this morning. As he was gasping his last breath, he said, 'The ranger knows,' and when they asked, 'What ranger,' he said, 'Cavanagh.' When I heard that I jumped a horse and beat 'em all over here. Is this true? <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> who the murderers are?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A few, p'raps," [...] {{said the}} old man; [...] "not many, let us trust. Yes, she sent me after you for fear you should offend Mr. Pendennis; and I daresay because she thought you wouldn't give her message to him, and beg him {{to go and see}} her; and she knew I would take her errand. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] I answered. [...] "You were airing your Arabic {{with that}} {{man at the}} tiller this afternoon. What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you?</b> He has been trading (slave-trading, probably) up and down these latitudes for half of his iniquitous life, and once landed on this very 'man' rock. Did he ever hear {{anything}} of the ruined city or the caves?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, dear," [...] {{she said}} simply. [...] "I think {{that perhaps he}} was afraid that one or other of us, if not both, might be upset by it if <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> <b>You</b> see, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{anything}} at all of our meeting, though I am sure that he will be glad when he knows that we both know all about it, and have told each other everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Could <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me,' <b>he</b> said, 'what I'm {{supposed}} to do? I've just joined the bank.' The benevolent man stopped, {{and looked at}} him with a pair of mild blue eyes. 'I think, perhaps, that your best plan would be to see the manager,' he said. 'Yes, I should certainly <b>do</b> that. <b>He</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what work you have to do. If you will permit me, I will show you the way.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Enough. It is natur', {{and it is}} right. Therein your grand'ther {{would have}} done the very same. Ah's me! what a number of seasons, hot and cold, wet and dry, have rolled over my poor head, since the time we worried it out together, among the Red Hurons of the Lakes, back in those rugged {{mountains}} of Old York! and many a noble buck has since that day fallen by my hand; ay, and many a thieving Mingo, too! Tell me, lad, did the general, for general I know he got to be, <b>did</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> of the deer we took, that night the outlyers of the accursed tribe drove us to the caves, on the island, and how we feasted and drunk in security?" ...|$|R
