40|$|Abstract Commercial <b>fishing</b> <b>logbook</b> {{data from}} the Shark Bay managed prawn fishery in Western Australia provide king prawn catch rate data densely {{informed}} and irregularly spaced in both the spatial and temporal domains. Space–time geo-statistical analysis for the {{data from the}} 2001 to 2004 fishing seasons has shown that short term catch rate prediction is possible {{with the use of the}} product-sum covari-ance model and the subsequent kriging estimation process. However the operation of closure lines within the fishery makes it difficult to capture the high catch rate be-haviour in areas as they first open to trawling. One of these regions is the Extended Nursery Area which usually opens in the first week of May. Analysis of the survey trawls from seasons 2001 to 2003 in this region in March and April shows there is a moderate positive correlation between the actual catch rate and the survey catch rate. By using the survey catch rate data as additional data in space–time geostatisti-cal estimation of the catch rates for May 2004, the space–time behaviour of the king prawn catch rate data is more successfully captured. ...|$|E

40|$|Novel data on {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} distribution of fishing effort and population abundance are presented for the market squid fishery (Loligo opalescens) in the Southern California Bight, 1992 − 2000. Fishing effort {{was measured by the}} detection of boat lights by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS). Visual confirmation of fishing vessels by nocturnal aerial surveys indicated that lights detected by satellites are reliable indicators of fishing effort. Overall, fishing activity was concentrated off the following Channel Islands: Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, and Santa Catalina. Fishing activity occurred at depths of 100 m or less. Landings, effort, and squid abundance (measured as landings per unit of effort, LPUE) markedly declined during the 1997 − 98 El Niño; landings and LPUE increased afterwards. Within a fishing season, the location of fishing activity shifted from the northern shores of Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands in October, the typical starting date for squid fishing in the Bight, to the southern shores by March, the typical end of the squid season. Light detection by satellites offers a source of fine-scale spatial and temporal data on fishing effort for the market squid fishery off California, and these data can be integrated with environmental data and <b>fishing</b> <b>logbook</b> data {{in the development of a}} management plan...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe European Research project " Catch, Effort, and eCOsystem {{impacts of}} FAD-fishing " (CECOFAD) {{set out to}} improve our {{understanding}} of the use of drifting fish-aggregating devices (DFADs) in tropical purse seine tuna fisheries in open ocean ecosystems. Data from unofficial technology information related to FAD-fishing were retrieved and the changes over time in systems used for positioning buoys at-sea (radio, satellite transmitters, echo sounder buoys) were quantified. The total number of DFADs deployed at sea in the Atlantic and Indian oceans over the last ten years was estimated from 2 different approaches, based on information provided by the French tuna association and extrapolated to the other purse seiner fleets. From data collected within the FAD National Management Plan, the relationship between the number of active DFADs and the catch per Spanish purse seiner (with or without the assistance of a supply vessel), was explored. Owing to the difficulty of gathering unofficial information, the standardization of CPUE was limited to juvenile bigeye caught using DFADs and to non-standard explanatory variables provided by the French fleet. The analysis was repeated for the combined French and Spanish fleets but with a smaller number of predictors because data for the Spanish fleet was missing. However the relevance of some non-traditional factors was highlighted, in particular the needs to collate the links between each supply vessel and its associated purse seiners and the number of active DFADs per vessel. As an alternative to CPUE, direct indices of tuna abundance through the use of echo sounder buoys attached to DFADs in the Spanish fleet were investigated. Due to the heterogeneity of echo sounder buoy information several criteria for cleaning datasets before performing an " alternate " Buoy-derived Abundance Index (BAI) were identified. Nominal measurements were then standardized using a GLMM approach. Behavioral models representing the continuous process of association and disassociation under FADs, were also identified as an alternative to commercial catch data for estimating abundance. Information collected by national FAD management plans was used to explore the rate of deployment of non-entangling DFADs and the apparent survival rate of released species of incidental catch. Time-area moratoria on DFADs, introduced regularly by tuna RFMOs, are limited to the protection of juvenile tuna and do not account for the potential impact on bycatch or associated megafauna (whales and whale sharks). A simple iterative " fishing-day " model, which included realistic scenarios in terms of difference in fishing strategies between the French and Spanish fleets, was developed to investigate the consequences on tropical tuna and bycatch of introducing wide area, six-month moratoria on DFAD sets. The simulations predicted a decrease in DFAD sets and an increase in free school sets, leading to an overall decrease in tuna catch of ~ 100 t/yr/boat in the Atlantic Ocean and 600 – 1800 t/yr/boat in the Indian Ocean. The bycatch for all groups considered (other bony fishes, billfishes, sharks and turtles) decreased, except for turtle and shark in the Atlantic Ocean. Because the fishing practices were modified, whale and whale shark associated sets increased slightly in the Indian Ocean. French GPS buoy trajectories were analyzed to detect the potential damage of lost DFADs on vulnerable coastal ecosystems. This showed that, for the period 2007 - 2013, around 10 % of the trajectories of floating objects with GPS-buoys ended with a “beaching event” in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, with significant portions of these beaching events occurring in areas with sensitive habitats, such as coral reefs. Bycatch data collected under the EU observer programs in the Indian, Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans, was used to evaluate the effect of FAD-fishing in terms of diversity. Regional differences were identified but the species diversity associated with the DFADs was found to be richer than for free school sets. One of the tasks of CECOFAD was to provide bridges between the various databases used in the project. The French versions of the Balbaya (logbooks) and ObsTuna (observer data) databases were linked using the Standard Data-Exchange Format used within the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF). This format allows a data aggregation level while respecting data confidentiality issues and should be considered as a good candidate for the exchange of data within the tropical tuna research community. Owing to the lack or imprecision of DFAD-fishing activity data, the definitions of variables required for evaluating DFAD-fishing activities that should be continuously recorded in logbooks were reviewed. On the basis on the most recent recommendations from tRFMOs the electronic <b>fishing</b> <b>logbook</b> data model (ERS) was extended to floating objects with the aim to incorporate the information required for measuring the DFAD-fishing effort and to produce indicators of the effect on the ecosystem of deploying floating objects.

40|$|Recreational {{fisheries}} can be {{prone to}} severe declines, yet these fisheries, particularly catch-and-release, are often data-limited, constraining our ability to conduct stock assessments. A combination of catch and effort indices derived from fisheries-dependent data (FDD) gathered from <b>fishing</b> <b>logbooks</b> could be a powerful approach to inform these data gaps. This study demonstrates the utility of using different catch metrics such as indices of abundance, species richness associated with reported catch, and the success rate of targeted trips, to assess historical shifts in the trajectory of the data-limited bonefish (Albula vulpes) fishery in Florida Bay, an economically-important recreational fishery within the Caribbean Basin. We used FDD from fishing guide reports submitted to Everglades National Park to determine temporal patterns in the bonefish population over the past 35 years. These reports indicated a decline in recreational catches in Florida Bay since the late 1980 s, with an accelerated decline starting in the late 1990 s-early 2000 s. Analyses showed an overall 42 % reduction in bonefish catches. Trends {{in the proportion of}} positive trips (i. e., the probability of catching success) followed the declining catch patterns, suggesting major population changes starting in 1999 - 2000. As bonefish catches declined, species richness in bonefish trips increased by 34 %, suggesting a decrease in bonefish abundance and/or shift in fishing effort (e. g., giving-up time, changes in preferred species). Results provide additional resolution to a pattern of decline for bonefish in South Florida and highlight the value of reconstructing time-series for the development of hypotheses about the potential driving mechanisms of species decline. Further, the data-limited nature of most recreational fisheries, and the increase in a use of catch-and-release as a fisheries management strategy point to the need to develop further data integration tools to assess population trends and the sustainability of these fishery resources...|$|R

40|$|The {{sociology}} and habits of recreational anglers on the Island of Majorca (western Mediterranean) were evaluated using telephone and on-site surveys, {{as well as}} <b>fishing</b> <b>logbooks</b> and recreational <b>fishing</b> competitions. The recreational fishery {{is one of the}} island's main leisure activities, 5. 14 % of the population (37 265 people) participating. Enthusiasts tend to be mainly middle class (most anglers own boats moored at marinas), middle-aged males (90 % male, mean age 46 ± 2 years). The most popular fishing method is from a boat (62. 9 %), followed by fishing from shore (32. 4 %), and spearfishing (3. 6 %). The mean time spent fishing is 3. 86 ± 0. 03 h d- 1, and more than one type of gear (mean 1. 27 ± 0. 21) is used simultaneously by a single angler. The frequency of fishing is 4 - 6 times per month, mainly on holidays and weekends, increasing in summer. The activity has a sizeable impact on the coastal fauna, with diverse catches of at least 1209. 25 t year- 1 (about 615 000 fishing outings year- 1). Thus, the amount of carbon extracted annually is at least 137. 34 kg C km- 2 year- 1, and the recreational fishery removes about 31 % of production at trophic level 4. Although these are gross estimates and more detailed study of the effect on trophic level and local production is needed, the values do highlight the pressure the recreational fishery exerts on coastal fish communities. Assuming that this level of exploitation is common to north-shore Mediterranean countries, there may be cause for concern about sustainable exploitation in the recreational fishery, and the effectiveness of current protection measures is discussed. Despite the limitations of the study, recreational fisheries clearly should be taken into account when considering measures for fisheries management. Moreover, fishing has considerable social import, and the benefits {{must be taken into account}} when investments to protect exploited resources are being contemplated. © 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

Information on the spatial distribution of fishing effort is critical to conducting this type of spatially-oriented management for at least two reasons. First, harvest information from individual vessels can generate data used in higher spatial resolution stock assessment. Second, understanding the location choice behavior of fishermen is important in understanding the effects of policy on both fish stocks and the fishermen themselves.

40|$|In {{assessment}} {{and management of}} marine fish resources, representative data of statistically good quality describing the actual catch are lacking for many fisheries. Even for the most studied fisheries in the north Atlantic, the uncertainty regarding what is actually caught has implications for management.

Consequently, stock {{assessment and}} management of marine fish resources exploited by those fisheries are based on poor or scarce catch data. Presently, sampling at sea are often random in time and place, and not necessarily representative {{with respect to the}} fleet metier.

North American Association of Fisheries Economists (NAAFE), Corvallis, 2017. This work reports on how resource rent is distributed among owners of exclusive fishing grounds in the spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) fishery of Punta Allen, Mexico. This MSC certified small-scale fishery is co-managed through Territorial User Rights. Members {{of the local}} fishing cooperative, have exclusive access to individual fishing grounds. The fishery {{is based on the}} use of artificial shelters, bottom devices that by providing refuge attract and aggregate lobsters facilitating their harvest by free diving and hand nets. In order to assess the distributive performance of this fishery, data from the <b>fishing</b> cooperative <b>logbooks</b> were used to calculate the fishing resource rent achieved spatially by the owners of fishing grounds and corresponding artificial shelters invested in them. Inequality metrics (Lorenz Curve and Gini index) were applied to the calculated fishery distributional performance indicators. The individual resource rent analysis was spatially undertaken considering the transfer cost of steaming from port to alternative exclusive fishing grounds, the corresponding cost of fishing and the opportunity cost of the investments in site specific artificial shelters and fishing assets (i. e. boat, engine and gears). The Gin index presented relatively low values [0. 372, 0. 429]. Results showed that in this lobster fishery, fishing revenues spread more equally than other fisheries where their distributional performances have been assessed. These results suggest that the relative success of this MSC certified small-scale lobster fishery could be explained in part by the relatively low inequality in the distribution of the benefits among fishers of this rights based fishery...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{assessment}} of nominal effort {{is a key}} issue for the estimation of total catches. However, in many datacollection systems, total effort is inferred from sampling schemes at landing points or calculated from <b>fishing</b> forms or <b>logbooks,</b> which do not provide accurate information on a vessel's fishing activity. This problem is especially significant in small-scale fleets where fishers' behaviour and related fishing activity are heterogeneous. As fuel consumption by fishers is often subject to tax relief, it is registered by administration {{and can be used}} to improve and cross-check nominal effort measures (hours at sea, days at sea). This paper presents a methodology developed, using this type of dataset, for French West Indies fisheries. The protocol implemented was in three steps and used different data sources. First, a statistical analysis of engine power, engine type, and fuel consumption per métier was carried out based on field studies and fleet register information.

Individual vessel location choices and model variables were aggregated to ICES statistical rectangles (approximately 30 nautical miles square) by month. The model outputs show that vessels in southwest England made location choices (in 2005 - 2007) based on recent economic returns (value of catch per hour fished) in the month prior and in the previous year in the same month. Vessel skippers also made decisions based on the economic returns of the entire fleet; and tended to choose locations that yielded higher economic returns to the fleet compared to other available locations. This suggests a transfer of knowledge on what others in the fleet are catching and where. Beam trawlers also appeared to be risk-averse, preferring to fish locations closer to their homeport, and at locations with less variance in the value of catch per unit effort at a location, even if the economic returns could be high elsewhere. Vessels also preferred to fish in deeper water, particularly the larger vessels of the fleet. To evaluate the models predictive ability, we compared 2008 location choices with predicted choices using the 2005 - 2007 model coefficients.
