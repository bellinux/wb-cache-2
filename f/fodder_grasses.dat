50|$|Improved multi-course crop-rotations began {{slowly to}} be {{introduced}} on mir arable in the late 19th century. The early experiments were mainly on the non-Black-earth lands, especially the Central-Industrial, West and North-West regions. Flax was the first `new' crop {{to be introduced}} into the rotation. But within the three-course system flax exhausted the soil's fertility; peasants learned to replenish it by planting clover. Multi-course systems with sown <b>fodder</b> <b>grasses</b> and clover (travopolye (Травополье), travoseyanie) allowed more cattle and other livestock to be kept, who in turn provided more manure to increase soil fertility. This `fodder-crop revolution' had earlier been central to the 18th-century agricultural revolution in Western Europe. By 1924 multi-crop rotations covered 7.2% of the sown area of the Russian Federation. But these improvements were largely confined to the Central-Industrial, Western and North-Western regions. Moscow province was at the forefront; there the three-field system was almost eliminated {{by the end of}} 1926. But, up to the mid-1920s, such progress was largely confined to the Central-Industrial, Western and North-Western regions. The grain-surplus areas had as yet seen little progress. In 1924 multi-course systems covered just 3% of arable in the Central Black-Earth region, and the situation was even worse elsewhere. But thereafter rapid progress was made in the grain-surplus areas. It also continued in the grain-deficit areas. By 1927 multi-course rotations covered 17.3% of the sown area in the Russian Federation as a whole. And `by 1928 grass had almost everywhere replaced fallow, the most important exception being the Central Black-Earth region'.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Alternative {{methods to}} control {{invasive}} <b>fodder</b> <b>grasses</b> {{are necessary to}} reduce the use of herbicides in forest restoration, which {{has been carried out}} primarily in riparian zones. We sought to investigate if inter-row cultivation of crotalaria (Crotalaria breviflora DC) or pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata Duschene ex. Poir) with native tree species is an efficient strategy to con-trol invasive <b>fodder</b> <b>grasses</b> in restoration plantings. We tested five treatments in a randomized block design, namely (1) control of brachiaria grass (Urochloa decumbens (Stapf.) Webster) with glyphosate in the implementation and post-planting grass control of the reforestation, (2 and 3) glyphosate use in the implementation and inter-row sowing of crotalaria (2) or pumpkin (3), and control of brachiaria by mowing in the post-planting phase, (4 and 5) mowing in the implementa-tion and inter-row sowing of crotalaria (4) or pumpkin (5), and control of brachiaria by mowing in the post-planting phase. Post-planting grass control was carried out four and nine months after tree seedling planting. Throughout 13 months, we evaluated the percentage of ground cover by brachiaria grass, pumpkin production, and native tree seedling mortality, height and crown cover. The exclusive use of glyphosate, without inter-row sowing of pumpkin or crotalaria showed the most favorable results for controlling brachiaria grass and, consequently, for tree seedling development. Hence, inter-row cultivation of green manure or short-lived crop species is not enough to control invasive grasses in restoration plantings, and complementary weeding is necessary to reduce the highly competitive potential of C 4 grasses for supporting native spe-cies seedlings growth...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to assess the restoration and development potential of dry hill range ecosystems. The study was carried out in the Ahfara area, which is representative for large parts of the Arabian Peninsula, and therefore has excellent potential to become a benchmark site for ecosystem restoration in the region. The natural vegetation is dominated by spiny trees and shrubs, which can survive the frequent prolonged drought periods. Inherent carrying capacity is low. Dominant land use is range grazing and sporadic oasis-type, small-scale irrigation farming of date palms and <b>fodder</b> <b>grasses.</b> Groundwater extraction is high and the water table has fallen considerably. The area has favorable restoration potential, but the limits to restoration are set by the climatic conditions and the groundwater availability. Restoration needs to be based on an improvement of rainwater interception to improve soil-moisture storage and encourage groundwater recharge. Four development scenarios, i. e. pathways, are proposed, which build on each other and which may be combined at any level of spatial extent and sophistication of activities. They range from a relatively simple enclosure (ecosystem restoration area) to a nature conservation center with various degrees of animal integration and national heritage conservation (desert museum and heritage center) that has potential for eco-tourism.

40|$|In the Mediterranean region, {{climate and}} land use change are {{expected}} to impact on natural and agricultural ecosystems by warming, reduced rainfall, direct degradation of ecosystems and biodiversity loss. Human population growth and socioeconomic changes, notably on the eastern and southern shores, will require increases in food production and put additional pressure on agro-ecosystems and water resources.

This study presents the inclusion of 10 Mediterranean agricultural plants, mainly perennial crops, in an agro-ecosystem model (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land – LPJmL) : nut trees, date palms, citrus trees, orchards, olive trees, grapes, cotton, potatoes, vegetables and <b>fodder</b> <b>grasses.</b> The model was successfully tested in three model outputs: agricultural yields, irrigation requirements and soil carbon density.

Ergot is a fungus, belonging to the genus Cordyceps, which, (like so many of the order to which it belongs) is parasitical upon other plants. Many of the species indeed attack the lower animals, and probably some of those present have witnessed its effects in what are called " vegetable caterpillars " where the fungus grows from the head of the victim and completely destroys it.

The host of selected nematodes should be studied to determine which crops can be used to reduce their population to non-pathogenic levels. Nematicides should be field tested to determine the economically optimal rate and time of application before recommendations are made to farmers.
