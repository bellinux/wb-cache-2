40|$|With {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} cloud based data management, im-proving {{the performance of}} queries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> is an urgent issue to solve. Summary of data distribution and statistical information has been commonly used in traditional database to support query optimization, and histograms are of particular interest. Naturally, histograms {{could be used to}} support query optimization and effi-cient utilization of computing resources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b> Histograms could provide helpful reference information for generating optimal query plan, and generate basic statistics useful for guaranteeing the load balance of query processing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b> Since it is too expen-sive to construct the exact histogram on massive data, building the approximate histogram is a more feasible solution. This problem, however, is challenging to solve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> environment because of the special data organization and processing mode <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we present HEDC, a Histogram Estimator for Data <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cloud.</b> We design a histogram estimate workflow based on an extended MapReduce framework, and propose novel sampling mechanisms to leverage the sampling efficiency and estimate accu-racy. We experimentally validate our techniques on Hadoop and the results demonstrate that HEDC can provide promising histogram estimate for massive data <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{orange and}} brown {{coloration}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> of Jupiter {{are caused by}} upwelling compounds that change color when {{they are exposed to}} ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances are thought to be phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons. These colorful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer, lower deck of clouds. The zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallizing ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus clouds, like {{cirrostratus}} clouds, {{can produce}} several optical effects, such as halos {{around the sun}} and moon. Halos are caused by interaction of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds,</b> which, depending on their shape and orientation, {{can result in a}} wide variety of white and colored rings, arcs and spots in the sky. Common halo varieties are the 22° halo, sun dogs, the circumzenithal arc and the circumhorizontal arc (also known as fire rainbows). Halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by cirrostratus.|$|E
5|$|During Ruisdael's last period {{he began}} to depict {{mountain}} scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds.</b> Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses {{all but two of}} them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.|$|E
40|$|Microservices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} popular platform to run services on. However, general purpose operating systems found within most VMs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> use more resources than necessary. The proposed solution to these problems are running the services using unikernels. Unikernels are specialised library operating systems designed for a single purpose. However, unikernels are still relatively new, meaning that the outcome of running microservices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> using unikernels are unknown. Two API Gateway services were created, and run <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> using Ubuntu and IncludeOS. Several experiments were conducted to test the latter two, and the data compared. An analysis on the development process, and a feature analysis with other cloud services was done aswell. Ubuntu was declared as the current best alternative to run services on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>in</b> this thesis. Yet, IncludeOS proved to work for running microservices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud,</b> and showed some promising features such as 0 CPU during idle, low memory footprint, and 13, 9 % more efficient in terms of CPU usage at handling 1000 client connections per second than Ubuntu...|$|R

40|$|We {{can only}} enjoy the full {{benefits}} of Cloud computing {{if we can}} address the privacy disclosure problem about individual or company. As large amounts of data which are stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> contain private information and are in non-aggregate format, sharing the data with third-party service providers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> without strict restriction will cause great danger to data privacy. Although increased awareness of <b>the</b> privacy issues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud,</b> little {{work has been done}} in privacy-preserving data classification based cloud environment. To solve this problem, we explore a novel algorithm named PPKC (Privacy Preserving K-NN Classification) for mining data <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> without <b>the</b> disclosure of sensitive information...|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Stafford and Cernan, still {{circling}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> in {{the second}} T-38, {{had no idea what}} had happened to their flight partners. Air traffic controllers were confused by the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach, and moreover no one on the ground knew who was in the crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day.|$|E
5|$|See then {{elected to}} perform a visual {{circling}} approach, a simplified landing procedure allowing flight under instrument rules, {{as long as the}} pilot can keep the airfield and any preceding aircraft in sight. The reported weather conditions at the airport were adequate for this type of approach, but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly. Stafford began to follow See's plane, but when he lost sight of it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> he instead followed the standard procedure for a missed approach and pulled his aircraft up, back into the clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing.|$|E
5|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} from the Sun breaks water molecules apart, {{reducing the amount of}} water available to form noctilucent clouds. The radiation is known to vary cyclically with the solar cycle and satellites have been tracking the decrease in brightness of the clouds with the increase of ultraviolet radiation for the last two solar cycles. It has been found that changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> follow changes in the intensity of ultraviolet rays by about a year, but the reason for this long lag is not yet known.|$|E

5|$|The {{appearance}} of an ala is diversely and often vaguely described in folklore. A given ala {{may look like}} a black wind, a gigantic creature of indistinct form, a huge-mouthed, humanlike, or snakelike monster, a female dragon, or a raven. An ala may also assume various human or animal shapes, and can even possess a person's body. It is believed that the diversity of appearances described is due to the ala's being a synthesis of a Slavic demon of bad weather and a similar demon of the central Balkans pre-Slavic population. In folk tales with a humanlike ala, her personality {{is similar to that of}} the Russian Baba Yaga. Ale are said to live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds,</b> or in a lake, spring, hidden remote place, forest, inhospitable mountain, cave, or gigantic tree. While ale are usually hostile towards humans, they do have other powerful enemies that can defeat them, like dragons. In Christianized tales, St. Elijah takes the dragons' role, but in some cases the saint and the dragons fight ale together. Eagles are also regarded as defenders against ale, chasing them away from fields and thus preventing them from bringing hail clouds overhead.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} on the {{floating}} island of Skyloft and surrounding airborne islands; and the three Surface overworlds {{where the majority of}} the main adventure takes place. Side quests for the town's citizens are unlocked as the game progresses. The different areas of the Surface are accessed through portals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds.</b> Side quests for characters of the Surface are also available, and sometimes mandatory for completing the main quest. The Skyloft overworld is navigated with a great bird called a Loftwing, while the Surface is navigated on foot. Marker beacons can be set on the map for Link to follow, and save points in the form of statues preserve Link's progress up to that point. During his quest, Link is aided by the sword spirit Fi, who is able to give hints to the player for both environmental elements and enemies: for example, when an enemy is targeted and Fi is summoned, she will give the enemy's characteristics and weaknesses.|$|E
5|$|The {{principles}} of electrostatics are important when designing items of high-voltage equipment. There is a finite {{limit to the}} electric field strength that may be withstood by any medium. Beyond this point, electrical breakdown occurs and an electric arc causes flashover between the charged parts. Air, for example, tends to arc across small gaps at electric field strengths which exceed 30kV per centimetre. Over larger gaps, its breakdown strength is weaker, perhaps 1kV per centimetre. The most visible natural occurrence of this is lightning, caused when charge becomes separated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> by rising columns of air, and raises the electric field {{in the air to}} greater than it can withstand. The voltage of a large lightning cloud may be as high as 100MV and have discharge energies as great as 250kWh.|$|E

5|$|A human {{going into}} an ala’s house, which is {{frequently}} {{deep in a}} forest, but may also be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds,</b> in a lake, spring, cave, gigantic tree, or other hidden remote place, or on an inhospitable mountain, can have varied consequences. If he approaches the ala with an appeal, and does not mention the differences between her and humans, he will be rewarded. Otherwise, he will be cruelly punished. According to one story, a stepdaughter, driven away from home by her stepmother, comes to an ala’s house; addresses her with the word mother; picks lice from the ala’s hair full of worms; and feeds the ala’s “livestock” of owls, wolves, badgers, and other wild animals; behaving and talking as if these things are quite normal to her, and is rewarded by the ala with a chest filled with gold. When the stepmother’s daughter comes to the ala’s house, she does the opposite, and the ala punishes her and her mother by sending them a chest of snakes, which blind them. In another example, when a prince asks an ala for her daughter’s hand, she saves him from other ale, and helps him get married. But when a girl to whom an ala is the godmother visits the ala with her mother, the ala eats them both because the mother talked about the strange things in her house.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August 1945, a second B-29 (Bockscar), piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, lifted off with Fat Man on board. This time, Ashworth served as weaponeer and Kokura was the primary target. Sweeney took off with the weapon already armed but with the {{electrical}} safety plugs still engaged. When they reached Kokura, they found cloud cover had obscured the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low, they headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. Ashworth decided that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured, but a last-minute break <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> over Nagasaki allowed a visual approach as ordered. The Fat Man was dropped over the city's industrial valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works {{in the south and}} the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works in the north. The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT, roughly the same as the Trinity blast, but was confined to the Urakami Valley, and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, resulting in the destruction of about 44% of the city. The bombing also crippled the city's industrial production extensively and killed 23,200–28,200 Japanese industrial workers and 150 Japanese soldiers. Overall, an estimated 35,000–40,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.|$|E

The party find three small floating spheres {{in the middle of the}} room; a mysterious voice commands them to swallow the spheres. The party refuses, and instead hold onto the spheres for safekeeping. As they try to reach another Mechat to escape the base, they are forced to fight a large army of Nene's robots. When the battle seems it will never end, and with the unseen voice promising them knowledge of how to pilot the Mechat, the party members eat the spheres. As they consume the spheres, a strange transformation occurs to each, changing the forms of their shadows into powerful beings that are able to destroy the robot army. The party escapes the base and crash in a desert.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — There {{is always}} a risk of data owner’s {{identity}} and privacy when data is stored in a untrusted <b>cloud.</b> As <b>the</b> data can be easily accessed by others <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud,</b> {{there is also a}} risk of data modification or data stealing. To overcome this, a method that encrypts the data before it is stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> and a technique to find the guilt agent is proposed. This paper also focuses on the dynamic groups that work in organizations that use cloud for their data storage, where a newly joined user can directly decrypt <b>the</b> files stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud</b> before he joined <b>the</b> <b>cloud.</b> We are also proposing a method using which storage servers as well as unauthorized users cannot learn <b>the</b> content stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cloud...</b>|$|R
