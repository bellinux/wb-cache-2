5|$|In this stage, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> {{to inquire}} into, firstly, {{the object of}} the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of {{differentiation}} against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration {{the object of the}} statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E

5|$|The {{management}} of narcosis {{is simply to}} ascend to shallower depths; the effects then disappear within minutes. In the event of complications or other conditions being present, ascending is always the correct initial response. Should problems remain, then <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to abort the dive.

5|$|Dancers in the United Kingdom {{have had}} success in hip-hop theater. In 2006, hip-hop dance company Boy Blue Entertainment won a Laurence Olivier Award for their show Pied Piper. In 2008, Into the Hoods {{became the first}} hip-hop theater show to perform in London's West End. It {{eventually}} {{went on to become}} the West End's longest running dance show ever. According to Clemente, the future of hip-hop dance is in theater; he believes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> for the dance to make this transition in order for it to be legitimized as an art form.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the {{corporate}} {{administrator for the}} RDA mining operation. While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize {{the attacks on the}} Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary,</b> and the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.|$|E
5|$|His later {{writings}} show {{no change}} in his fundamental positions. Other elements in Zwingli's theology would lead him to deny that baptism {{is a means of}} grace or that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> for salvation. His defence of infant baptism was not only a matter of church politics, but was clearly related to the whole of his theology and his profound sense of unity of the church.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} stages of {{end-of-life}} care, midazolam is routinely used at low doses via subcutaneous injection to help with agitation, myoclonus, restlessness or anxiety in the last hours or days of life. At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments, but the need for this is rare.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} Pokémon games, Diamond and Pearl chronicle {{the adventures}} of a young Pokémon trainer as he/she trains and battles Pokémon while also thwarting the schemes of a criminal organization. The games add many new features, such as Internet play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and changes to battle mechanics and Pokémon Contests, along with addition of 107 new Pokémon. The games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and while both can be played separately, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to trade between {{them in order to}} complete the games' Pokédexes.|$|E
5|$|More {{problematic}} for non-commercial plants is the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and yellowing of the leaves). This {{is the most}} serious disease of Narcissus. Since the fungus can remain in the soil for many years <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years. Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include N. triandrus, N. tazetta and N. jonquilla.|$|E
