40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{segmentation}} of the fabric weave patterns for the urgent requirement of fabric <b>imitative</b> <b>design</b> and redesign. The weave patterns related to the fabric yarn are determined by a new technology,which is called bidimensional mode decomposition based method. The proposed method first iteratively decompose the underlying fabric image into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The first order IMF is applied to to calculate histogram and fabric weave pattern segmentation results are obtained by integrating corresponding threshold decision strategies such as double maxima algorithm or Otsu algorithm. In comparison with the original image-only based histogram segmentation method,the presented method have a high precision. Simulation results show that BEMD based method is a promising approach for the segmentation of fabric weave pattern. </p...|$|E
40|$|This project {{presents}} a novel consideration of two quite different cultural {{approaches to the}} challenges of design, heritage, materials, form and function. The resulting furniture objects demonstrate a model of 'dualism' that recognises distinct elements of Thai and Tasmanian culture, design and use of natural materials within a contemporary design aesthetic. Synthetic materials, imported know-how, <b>imitative</b> <b>design</b> and mechanised manufacture dominate Thailand’s contemporary commercial furniture industry. In contrast, contemporary Tasmanian furniture is distinguished by bespoke design and handcrafting with local materials and a strong sense of originality and authenticity. Through this project I have considered my own cross-cultural circumstances and Buddhist heritage as driving influences for designing and making furniture that incorporates representations of elements in Buddhist thought, Thai vernacular and aristocratic design and contemporary Western cultural practices within a broadly Modernist aesthetic. My studio-based research investigated the attributes of traditional Thai design,especially the floating, reflective and contrasting effects of architectural construction and ornamentation, and the dynamic expression of overlapping roof tiers, and sought to find ways of re-introducing these cultural characteristics through contemporary furniture. These influences have guided the choice of materials, technological application and an aspiration for local sustainability, durability, transportability and affordability. In undertaking the project, I have considered the contrasts between Western and Thai customs for utilising furniture, most notably the high-raised platform of Western furniture and the traditional mode of Oriental floor living. These apparent incompatibilities stimulated me to attempt to synchronise the pace of my own cultural and design heritage with native Tasmanian timbers, cross-cultural experience and progressive technologies. Following experiments and reflection, I have resolved a strategy to assimilate vernacular Thai content with pared down aesthetics, hands-on execution, mechanical production and Buddhist ‘dualism’. I extracted the trapezoidal connection between traditional Thai walls, cabinets and revealed joinery to evolve planar, linear and volumetric designs. The processes of realisation included sketched designs, computeraided design (CAD), computer modelling, miniature models, full-scale prototypes and final fabrication. The context of my research was informed by the works of architects, designers and sculptors who demonstrate methods of combining geometric abstractions and austere aesthetics, the interplay of opposites, and multi-cultural and spiritual influences. These practitioners include Modernists George Nakashima, Constantin Brancusi, Isamu Noguchi and contemporary architect I. M. Pei. I also looked into cantilever furniture, Kinetic Art and Op Art influences for spatial, dynamic and illusory connections. The results of the project comprise series of benches and demountable shelving units. All pieces embody Buddhist dualism – complementary opposites, immingled with cantilever structure, multiple functions, changing visual effects in plane and line and contemporary fabrication. Individually and collectively they are intended to elicit the sense of place and nostalgia associated with regional Tasmanian timber,characteristics of Thai architecture, ornamentation and floating volume of typical Thai boats providing a riparian connection between Hobart and Bangkok...|$|E
40|$|Architectural {{education}} today {{places a}} certain {{emphasis on the}} specialized research on 'precedents'. According to a certain school of thought. creativity is considered a process {{largely due to the}} workings of the subconscious, lessons from precedents may be a very conscious act to feed the mind in the hope of fruitful stimulation of the imagination. Yet there are those who reject the merit of such a process and who even consider it a means to baised and unintuitive solutions. Although commendable and innovative designs are seen among students and practitioners alike, it was observed that many of the students were either copying the magazines unquestionably, or were generally at a loss, unable to recognize the purposes and goals of their explorations. Students and practitioners alike are seen being misguided in their use of precedents, thus in some instance ending up with <b>imitative</b> <b>designs...</b>|$|R

50|$|Powell's {{stained glass}} recreates the elegance, the refinement, the brevity that {{is seen in}} some of the finest {{examples}} of glass, sculpture and illumination of the 13th and 14th centuries. He utilised the flowing, curving lines, the flourish of drapery, the calligraphic brushstrokes and pure colour. However, Powell's work was not, like many stained glass designers, merely <b>imitative.</b> His <b>designs</b> are original innovations in the Gothic style. The quality of Hardman's church windows, particularly in the 1850s and 1860s, was superb.|$|R
40|$|Rupert Sheldrake’s {{theory of}} morphic {{resonance}} suggests {{a means by}} which the thoughts or behaviours of physically isolated members of species can converge in a manner that would not be expected by other forms of learning such as imitation. The proposed mechanism is via what is termed a ‘morphogenetic field’, a purported collective record of intra-species learning which subsequently shapes and stabilises the behaviours of future generations of organisms. In the human realm, Sheldrake has suggested that the acquisition of language should be influenced by the morphic resonance of past speakers of the language. Parapsychological tests of the theory have thereby typically consisted of learning activities involving a language unfamiliar to the participant. For example, Robbins and Roe presented participants with 10 Chinese symbols, 5 of which were genuine Mandarin Chinese characters whereas the other 5 were <b>imitative</b> symbols <b>designed</b> to appear authentic but having no meaning to Mandarin Chinese speakers. Participants were subsequently given a memory task in which they were asked to identify the symbols they had seen from a larger pool of 20 symbols (10 genuine, 10 imitative) containing all of the 10 originally presented. As predicted by the theory, participants were found to correctly recall more of the genuine characters compared with the imitative characters, and also exhibited more false memories of the genuine characters. Their bias towards recalling more genuine characters was also correlated with a measure of transliminality. However, potential shortcomings were identified within the experimental design. Most notably, as no methodical controls had been employed when contriving imitative symbols, it was possible that the genuine characters used in the study were in some way inherently more memorable than the imitative symbols which could alone account for the observed effects. The current study therefore attempted to replicate the findings of Robbins and Roe but drew upon a larger set of more systematically manipulated genuine and imitative characters, and used a more comprehensive system of randomising across participants. One hundred and one participants were shown, in a randomised order, 8 genuine and 8 imitative characters from one of three sets. They then took part in a distractor task by playing ‘scissors-paper-stone’ against a computer opponent for 1 minute. Subsequently, participants were presented with symbols in pairs (one genuine and one imitative) matched with each other for complexity and radical component (a key element of the character) and asked to indicate if they recalled seeing either character at the presentation stage. For some trials, participants had previously seen one of the characters whereas in others, both symbols were novel. Contrary to the previous study, participants correctly identified a similar number of real and imitative characters, whereas they exhibited more false memories for the imitative. Furthermore, the proposed relationships between the purported morphic resonance effect and transliminality and openness to experience were not supported. The enhanced experimental controls are thought to be the most salient explanation for the nullification of result...|$|R
