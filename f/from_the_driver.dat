5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} of as an {{automated}} electronic log book. An ELD records the same information as a manual paper log book, and requires less input <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book.|$|E

25|$|In a {{test drive}} of the LP550-2 Valentino Balboni, the test driver bearing {{the name of}} the car said he was against E-gear because it takes some amount of vehicle control away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver,</b> and all-wheel drive Lamborghinis from the beginning, and the company was divided over AWD cars. In that review, a LP550-2 with E-Gear was tested.|$|E

25|$|In Mogadishu, TFG militias set up checkpoints in the city. At one checkpoint, a {{group of}} militia {{apparently}} attempted to extort money <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> of an oil tanker truck. In the ensuing argument, a rocket was fired at the vehicle, injuring at least 2 or 3 people. The vehicle had been carrying dozens of passengers who disembarked before the rocket attack.|$|E
25|$|Other Latin {{words that}} {{distinguish}} chariots {{by the number}} of animals yoked as a team are quadriga, a four-horse chariot used for racing and associated with the Roman triumph; triga, or three-horse chariot, probably driven for ceremonies more often than racing (see Trigarium); and seiugis or seiuga, the six-horse chariot, more rarely raced and requiring a high degree of skill <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> The biga and quadriga are the most common types.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the floor}} shift lever also has another plane of operation, for manual mode, with {{spring-loaded}} + and − positions. This plane is selected {{by moving the}} stick away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> (in vehicles with the driver's seat on the right, the lever is pushed to the left, and in left-hand drive cars, the stick is pushed to the right) when in D mode only. When this plane is selected, the DSG can now be controlled like a manual gearbox, albeit only under a sequential shift pattern.|$|E

25|$|A two-tier {{flat fare}} {{structure}} is in operation within the West Midlands county boundary; {{there is a}} standard single fare for any distance and a cheaper short-hop fare. Cash fares can be bought <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> on the bus, but as with some other urban operators, no change is given for security and speed of boarding. Child fares are available at half the adult cost. Graduated fares apply on some services outside the West Midlands. In 2015, NXWM started taking fares on the Transport for West Midlands(previously Centro) Swift smart card.|$|E
25|$|One {{major feature}} that distinguishes ZFS from other file systems {{is that it}} is {{designed}} with a focus on data integrity by protecting the user's data on disk against silent data corruption caused by data degradation, current spikes, bugs in disk firmware, phantom writes (the previous write did not make it to disk), misdirected reads/writes (the disk accesses the wrong block), DMA parity errors between the array and server memory or <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> (since the checksum validates data inside the array), driver errors (data winds up in the wrong buffer inside the kernel), accidental overwrites (such as swapping to a live file system), etc.|$|E
25|$|The Bennett {{fracture}} is {{an oblique}} intraarticular metacarpal fracture dislocation, {{caused by an}} axial force directed against the partially flexed metacarpal. This type of compression along the metacarpal bone is often sustained when a person punches a hard object, such as the skull or tibia of an opponent, or a wall. It can also occur {{as a result of}} a fall onto the thumb. This is a common injury sustained from bike falls, as the thumb is generally extended while around the handle bars. It is also a common injury in car crashes, especially into fixed objects, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> holding the steering wheel during impact. The hand moves forward, while the steering wheel rim hyperextends the thumb.|$|E

25|$|STIB sees {{itself as}} a {{provider}} of mobility rather than just public transport, and has a 49% share in the Cambio carsharing franchise. The Brussels conurbation— 19 municipalities plus adjoining commuter belt— is also served by a fairly dense network of main-line trains. The MOBIB contactless smart card {{can be used on}} buses, trams, the metro and for mainline railway season tickets, and is gradually being extended to other modes, although it is not yet accepted by De Lijn or TEC. A simple tariff system permits unlimited changes with a one-hour period for €2.50 when bought <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver,</b> €2.10 from a ticket machine. Real-time arrival indicators have been installed at many tram stops.|$|E
25|$|Taxi fares in Dallas {{compared}} to other large U.S. cities is very reasonable. The meter rate is $2.25 plus 20¢ every 1/9 mile. Additional passengers or pets (excluding service animals) are $2 extra, each. Also, fares {{to and from the}} two principal airports (DFW International Airport and Dallas Love Field) to Downtown Dallas and the Dallas Market Center area are set at a flat rate. Those rates are: $41 for DFW to or from Downtown Dallas, $18 to or from Dallas Love Field to Downtown, and $32 to or from DFW International to Dallas Market Center. Be advised: a fuel surcharge may also be added to fares if gas prices reach $2.50 per gallon or more for three consecutive weeks. In an April 2011 study conducted by the Chicago Dispatcher, Dallas taxis charge an estimated $12.75 for a distance of five miles with five minutes wait time. Tipping is not required, but is a good gesture if you receive good service <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|E
500|$|Increasingly, {{companies}} have been equipping their trucks with automatic transmissions {{for a variety of}} reasons. Operating a manual transmission requires more skill and attention {{on the part of the}} driver, partly due to the unsynchronized transmission found in heavy-duty trucks. Companies have found that switching from manual to automatic transmissions has many benefits, including increased fuel efficiency, increased driver retention, reduced wear and tear on the internal gears of transmissions (inexperienced drivers may frequently grind the gears if proper shifting techniques are not followed), reduced driver fatigue, and reduced accidents (manuals require more attention <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver,</b> thus increasing the chances for an accident). [...] All of these factors together add up to benefit the company by reducing costs incurred from transmission repairs, accidents, and driver turnover (a driver frustrated by a manual transmission may decide to quit his/her job).|$|E

50|$|Mansell-Mania greeted <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> as {{they arrived}} at Silverstone for the British Grand Prix. The track had been vastly remodelled for 1991, which {{garnered}} largely positive reviews <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers.</b> <b>The</b> track {{was no longer the}} fastest on the F1 calendar, but it now included many challenging corners for <b>the</b> <b>drivers.</b> Elsewhere Tom Walkinshaw had bought a 35% stake in the Benetton team, but <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> line-ups were unchanged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> previous race. Stefan Johansson continued to stand-in for the injured Alex Caffi at Footwork, although it was the last race he would do so.|$|R
500|$|DMA Design began {{pursuing}} open world game {{design with}} the first Grand Theft Auto, which allowed players to commandeer various automobiles and shoot various weapons within a mission-based structure. Unlike later games in the series, and indeed many earlier influences, the first two GTA games were 2D. In 1998, DMA moved many of these design concepts into a 3D world, with Body Harvest, a Nintendo 64 game developed by DMA Design (which eventually became Rockstar North when it was acquired by Rockstar Games). This title featured an open world with nonlinear missions and side-quests, {{as well as the}} ability to commandeer and drive a variety of vehicles. As such, it has been retroactively called [...] "GTA in space" [...] (despite {{the fact that most of}} the game takes place in various settings on earth), and is credited with making Grand Theft Auto III possible. Dan Houser has also cited the 3D Mario and Zelda games on the Nintendo 64 as major influences. Another important influence came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Driver</b> series, which was created in 1999, with its open city environments and being cited as the first driving game to allow the player to go anywhere in the map.|$|E
500|$|Toyota's No. 5 entry {{returned}} to the track to gain championship points but ran solely on electrical power. Merhi collided with Albuquerque while claiming third position <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> Unhindered in the final hour Jarvis crossed the start/finish line to clinch Audi's first overall victory of the season. It was Jarvis's and di Grassi's first win in the World Endurance Championship. The second Audi car secured its first victory since Tom Kristensen and Allan McNish in 2013. The No. 2 Porsche finished in second, two laps behind [...] Audi's No. 8 entry, and Rebellion Racing's No. 12 vehicle took a third-place finish, albeit a further two laps behind. Lapierre maintained his advantage to take victory in LMP2, earning his co-drivers Gustavo Menezes and Richelmi their first World Endurance Championship class wins, followed in second place by Derani, who was five seconds adrift. AF Corse's No. 71 Ferrari of Bird and Rigon took their second consecutive victory in LMGTE Pro, while the No. 67 Ford and the No. 77 Aston Martin took second and third positions, the former narrowly finishing ahead to secure its first podium finish in the World Endurance Championship. The class win came after Bruni's engine failed nine minutes before the race's end, forcing him to enter the pit lane. In LMGTE Am, Aston Martin was unhindered upon passing the No. 83 AF Corse entry and maintained its lead to win the category with a one-lap advantage.|$|E

2500|$|The narrow part of {{the horn}} next to the driver is called the [...] "throat" [...] and the large part {{farthest}} away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> is called the [...] "mouth". The angular coverage (radiation pattern) of the horn {{is determined by the}} shape and flare of the mouth. [...] A major problem of horn speakers is that the radiation pattern varies with frequency; high frequency sound tends to be emitted in narrow beams with poor off-axis performance. [...] Significant improvements have been made, beginning with the [...] "constant directivity" [...] horn invented in 1975 by Don Keele.|$|E
2500|$|Driver {{packages}} {{that are used}} to install driver software are copied in their entirety into a [...] "Driver Store", which is a repository of driver packages. This ensures that drivers that need to be repaired or reinstalled won't need to ask for source media to get [...] "fresh" [...] files. The Driver Store can also be preloaded with drivers by an OEM or IT administrator to ensure that commonly used devices (e.g. external peripherals shipped with a computer system, corporate printers) can be installed immediately. Adding, removing and viewing drivers from the [...] "Driver Store" [...] is done using PnPUtil.exe A new setting in Device Manager allows deleting the drivers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Driver</b> Store when uninstalling the hardware.|$|E
