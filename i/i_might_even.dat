It {{is a kind of}} eschatological experience so frequently encountered in a pathological form in schizophrenics. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> voice the belief that the schizophrenic form of psychic illness is regularly accompanied by illuminating insight into the irrationalism of social and political mores.|$|E

TV Guide Network also produced {{a series of}} related discussions with high-profile guest stars, media pundits, and prominent social figures called [...] "Curb: The Discussion" [...] debating the moral implications depicted in each episode. David {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "Finally, thanks to the TV Guide Network, I'll get a chance to watch actual, intelligent people discuss and debate the issues addressed on 'Curb'. Now if only someone could tell me where this alleged 'Network' is, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> watch it." ...|$|E

I've been so low budget for so long, and to have this {{incredibly}} amazing video was really very humbling. It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day– I'm very private about those things, I don't really talk to everybody. I'm not like the party girl running around. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> seem to {{be a bit of a}} diva. I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it." ...|$|E
5000|$|What {{beautiful}} nature. I enjoyed {{every minute}} of my time in Honduras. <b>I</b> thought it <b>might</b> <b>even</b> {{be a good place}} to live. Jisoo Han ...|$|R
60|$|I felt hurt. I {{also felt}} that if the {{interview}} were prolonged <b>I</b> <b>might</b> feel <b>even</b> more hurt. So I left him without a word, and drifted {{over to the other}} end of the car, where I took up a position between a stout lady and the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] Wingrave agreed. [...] "But I forgot! You don't understand! I {{have saved}} her from heaven knows what! I {{am going to}} give her the home she loves! Benevolence, isn't it? And yet, if I had only the pluck, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> succeed <b>even</b> now--so far as she is concerned." ...|$|R
500|$|Belle {{was also}} the main {{character}} in various comic books based on the film, including one set during Belle's stay at the castle published by Marvel Comics, and a prequel set several years before the film distributed by Disney Comics. In the former, the storylines generally have the servants trying to coax Belle into doing something with the Beast, only for it to backfire and nearly ruin their friendship before they make up. In the latter serial, Belle ends up {{locked up in a}} cellar by village children after reluctantly playing pirates with them, and later nearly goes down the path leading to Beast's castle. The latter serial also implies that she holds misandric views and refuses to associate herself with the village children, especially the males, due to their not being as well-versed in literature as she."Maurice: You should be playing outside with the other children! // Belle: I'm having a much better time in King Arthur's Court! Sometimes I can see myself living in a castle surrounded by servants. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> entertain the thought of a handsome prince.....As long as he was gentle and kind... Not like those childish roughnecks in the square! Not one of them could even spell gallant! // Maurice: A day will come when those boys will look like knights in shining armor to you. // Belle: Never! I won't {{have anything to do with}} them. Men are such... such... // Maurice: Hear that, Pierre? According to my daughter there isn't an ounce of difference between us! // Pierre: Oink! // Belle: Well, I suppose there are some exceptions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If," [...] {{the latter}} went on, [...] "you say 'yes' to {{something}} I {{am going to}} ask you, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> stay--in the neighbourhood--for longer still." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As you say," [...] he acquiesced. [...] "Still, I {{went and}} I do not regret it. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> {{remind you that}} I met with some success." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jan. 19.—Indeed, this is {{a strange}} world. Yesterday it seemed [...] Lord J. Russell might go out, or more likely <b>I</b> <b>might,</b> or <b>even</b> the [...] cabinet might go to pieces.

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{appeal to}} the Egyptian. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> tell her <b>even</b> what I shuddered to tell him. She cared for him, I was sure, well enough {{to have the courage}} to give him up. But where was I to find her? ...|$|R
5000|$|Second-placed jockey Lorcan Wyer said: [...] "Down at {{the start}} he Charm was {{whipping}} round a bit, and <b>I</b> thought we <b>might</b> <b>even</b> fall at the first. He gave me a tremendous ride but didn't quite see it out at the end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "However," [...] he thought, [...] "it will {{do no harm}} to have a {{talk with}} these people, and {{possibly}} <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> consider giving one of them a trial." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel that}} some candor is necessary. You {{have taken the}} man's side openly; you have sympathized with him; <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> {{say that you have}} led him on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is the trifle I possess, Harry, set in {{the balance}} against your worth? My aunt, as you say, has thought <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> be the gainer by the exchange." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a pity! He might {{throw some}} light on that which is so dark to us. But as to your own researches, {{if there is any}} {{possible}} way in which I can be of service to you I trust that you will command me. If I had any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to investigate the case, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> perhaps <b>even</b> now give you some aid or advice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I {{have made}} my {{confession}} that my love is mad. It is so mad, {{that had the}} ties {{between me and my}} dear lost boy been one silken thread less strong, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have swept <b>even</b> him from your side, when you favoured him.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I might wear an English {{coat and}} trouser. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> be a leading Muhammadan pleader. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> be {{received}} <b>even</b> at the Commissioner's tennis-parties where the English stand {{on one side}} and the natives on the other, in order to promote social intercourse throughout the Empire.

6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] she admitted, [...] "but crises do {{not occur}} in {{political}} affairs every day. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> be vain enough to suggest another and a simpler means of escape from your boredom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] she murmured, [...] "that {{you talk}} very nicely. I think <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> say that I {{like to hear}} you talk. But it is so useless. Won't you go now? Won't you please go now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not for six months--perhaps a year," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{must go to}} Paris--perhaps Vienna. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> {{have to go to}} New York.

6000|$|... "When will he come? When will he come?" [...] I cried inwardly, as {{the night}} lingered and lingered--as my {{bleeding}} patient drooped, moaned, sickened: and neither day nor aid arrived. I had, again and again, held the water to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating salts: my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his strength. He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he was dying; and <b>I</b> <b>might</b> not <b>even</b> speak to him.|$|R
60|$|As he was {{charitable}} in this proposal, so he {{was just}} in the performance to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen that none should touch anything that I had: then he took everything into his own possession, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have them, <b>even</b> to my three earthen jars.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{regarded}} you as {{more than}} an acquaintance,--as a friend. In days now past there were moments when I was almost rash enough to hope that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have said <b>even</b> more than that. I confess that I had no warrant for such hopes, but I believe that I may still look on you as a friend?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I must resign {{myself to}} being robbed," [...] Arnold answered. [...] "We haven't time, nowadays, for luncheon parties. On the whole, I think I should be {{justified}} in putting the amount down to petty cash. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> debit Mrs. Weatherley's account with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{charge in}} this gun might serve for many pistols, or for several fowling-pieces. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> sweep the reef, on an emergency, by using old iron for shot!

6000|$|... "It's {{an offer}} I wouldn't make to every one, Pratt," [...] he concluded. [...] "Just happens I'm rather at a loose end--had a nasty week at Newmarket. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> {{get you a}} few days down at our place in Norfolk, {{if you know how}} to handle a gun." ...|$|E
60|$|As he was {{charitable}} in his proposal, so he {{was just}} in the performance to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen, that none should offer to touch any thing I had: then he took every thing into his own possession, and gave me back an exact inventory of them, that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have them; <b>even</b> so much as my three earthen jars.|$|R
60|$|After {{a summer}} of good health of a very radiant order, {{toothache}} {{and the death of}} a very old friend, which came upon me like a thunderclap, have rather shelved my powers. I stare upon the paper, not write. I wish I could write like your Sculptors; yet I am well aware that I should not try in that direction. A certain warmth (tepid enough) and a certain dash of the picturesque are my poor essential qualities; and if I went fooling after the too classical, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> lose <b>even</b> these. But I envied you that page.|$|R
6000|$|Then the Queen's eyes sparkled {{with anger}} and she said: [...] "Then you have broken an {{ordinance}} of the King's court, for well you know that {{such a thing as}} that is not permitted.

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} is an {{argument}} I have very little sympathy with," [...] said Barbara. [...] "It is, you see, so easy for the incapable to impeach the successful man's honesty. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> go a little further and admit {{that it is an}} attitude I scarcely expected from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mary, {{then you}} shall {{look forward to}} be {{the wife of a}} governor, or captain; but you see, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> fill the place of a {{councilor}} with credit, because I could always come to you for advice before, I give an opinion--then I should be sure to be right.|$|E
6000|$|... 'At peril of his head,' said Wali Dad in English to me. 'Thanks to your Government, all {{our heads}} are protected, {{and with the}} {{educational}} facilities at my command'--his eyes twinkled wickedly--'I might be a distinguished member of the local administration.

60|$|I {{replied that}} I would have none, since beer made the hand shake and {{that on the}} {{steadiness}} of my hand that afternoon depended the lives of many. To do him justice he quite understood the point. Indeed, he ordered me to be conducted back to the camp at once that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> rest, and <b>even</b> sent {{one of his own}} attendants with me to hold a shield over my head as I walked so that I should be protected from the sun.|$|R
60|$|For Alice stood gazing stirlessly {{on and on}} {{into this}} {{infinitely}} strange, infinitely familiar shadowy, phantasmal face. 'Oh yes,' she replied, 'I quite understand, of course; but if <b>I</b> <b>might</b> just peep <b>even,</b> it would--I should be so much, much happier. Do let me just see him, Dr Ferguson, if only {{his head on the}} pillow! I wouldn't even breathe. Couldn't it possibly help--even a faith-cure?' She leant forward impulsively, her voice trembling, anal her eyes still shining beneath their faint, melancholy smile.|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} think that <b>I</b> <b>might</b> be {{contented}} <b>even</b> there. But while I was looking I was so sickened by headache, and disagreeable feelings arising from the air, that I often had to lie down on the sunny side of the bank. W., I found, was similarly troubled; he said he really thought in the morning {{he was going to have}} a fever. We went back to the house. There were services in the chapel; I could hear the organ pealing, and the singers responding.|$|R
