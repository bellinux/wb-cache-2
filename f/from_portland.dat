5|$|Rich with sediments {{deposited}} by {{flooding and}} fed by prolific rainfall {{on the western}} side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley {{is one of the most}} fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail.
