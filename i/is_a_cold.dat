5|$|East Antarctica <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> {{region with}} a ground base {{above sea level}} and {{occupies}} most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet {{as a whole is}} thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance. However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Snow White, {{which was}} a short story that the writers could expand and {{experiment}} with, Pinocchio {{was based on a}} novel with a very fixed story. Therefore, the story went through drastic changes before reaching its final incarnation. In the original novel, Pinocchio <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> rude, ungrateful, inhuman creature that often repels sympathy and only learns his lessons by means of brutal torture. The writers decided to modernize the character and depict him similar to Edgar Bergen's dummy Charlie McCarthy, but equally as rambunctious as the puppet in the book. The story was still being developed {{in the early stages of}} animation.|$|E
5|$|Lonely and needing {{someone to}} care for his {{children}} and help with the sewing and other chores, Mala takes the young girl Iva as his new wife. But Mala still longs for Aba, and their relationship <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> one. The Eskimos go hunting caribou by stampeding the animals into a lake and then hunting them with bow and arrow and spears from boats. Mala is haunted by Aba's death, and after pouring out his grief through dance and prayer he changes his name to Kripik. Kripik's attitude toward Iva softens dramatically, and they make love. The hunter whom Mala welcomed to the village the previous year returns to his village, and gives Kripik his wife in gratitude. The woman is {{more than happy to}} live with Mala, and Mala makes love to her as well.|$|E

5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) arrives to {{the office}} with a fake {{mustache}} to hide {{what he thinks is}} a pimple over his mouth. Michael soon learns that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> sore, and he over-reacts, thinking he has herpes. With some prodding from Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), Michael decides to tell his former lovers he has herpes, despite not yet having gone to a doctor. He calls Donna (Amy Pietz) first, abruptly telling her to get tested. Michael then calls Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), joking around with her before they have a more serious discussion. Much to Michael's dismay, she claims that he over-romanticized their relationship, and he hangs up without telling her about the herpes. Michael and Dwight drive out to tell Carol Stills (Nancy Carell), Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), and Pam's mother, Helene Beesly (Linda Purl).|$|E

The current is located off the eastern coast of Greenland along the Greenland continental margin.

The current is of major importance because it directly connects the Arctic to the Northern Atlantic, {{it is a major}} contributor to sea ice export out of the Arctic, and it is a major freshwater sink for the Arctic.|$|E

The divorce firm's owner, Ji Jia-wei (Danson Tang), thinks Xiao-tong's theory and love advice is idiotic while she thinks he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> hearted person who doesn't believe in love and only started his business so others can be like him.

25|$|In {{the final}} entry of the franchise, {{made up of}} four {{segments}} from a presumably failed television series, Belle teaches the Beast {{a thing or two}} about life itself, consideration and manners. He appears only in the first and fourth segments, and in a cameo in the third. In the first part, The Perfect Word, Beast and Belle have a bitter falling out at dinner when the Beast demands that Cogsworth open the windows to cool him down, despite the fact that he is the only one hot and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> wind, and angrily strikes his servant, Webster, a long-tongued dictionary. Despite Lumiere and Cogsworth's pleas, Beast refuses to apologise for his behaviour, until Webster, Crane and LePlume forge a letter of apology from the Beast to Belle. All is settled, until the Beast realises that it was a forgery. He furiously banishes Webster, Crane and LePlume from the castle, but Belle brings them back from the woods, and the Beast soon learns to forgive them, as their intentions were good.|$|E

It has also {{been referred to as}} the Underground Great Wall since it was built for the purpose of military defense. The complex was constructed from 1969 to 1979 in anticipation of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, as Sino-Soviet relations worsened and was officially reopened in 2000. Visitors were allowed to tour portions of the complex, which has been described as [...] "dark, damp, and genuinely eerie". Dixia Cheng has been closed for renovation since at least February 2008.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} The Times Literary Supplement commented, [...] "this {{is a most}} informative, candid and {{valuable}} book". Writing in Quill, published by the Society of Professional Journalists, Robert Vaughn Young commented, [...] "Perhaps {{because this is a}} sociological study of Scientology, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> calm, academic dissection of the subject and Hubbard." [...] The California Court of Appeal cited the book as a reference in a decision relating to a criminal defendant {{who was a member of}} Scientology. When Wallis died in 1990, his obituary in The Independent noted that The Road to Total Freedom [...] "still stands as a classic of good field research".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{observed}} 12 Monkeys {{depiction of}} the future, finding similarities with Blade Runner (1982; also scripted by David Peoples) and Brazil (1985; also directed by Terry Gilliam). [...] "The film is a celebration of madness and doom, with a hero who tries to prevail against the chaos of his condition, and is inadequate", Ebert wrote. [...] "This vision <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold,</b> dark, damp one, and even the romance between Willis and Stowe feels desperate rather than joyous. All of this is done very well, {{and the more you}} know about movies (especially the technical side), the more you're likely to admire it. And as entertainment, it appeals more to the mind than to the senses." ...|$|E

500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{wrote that}} Valkyrie [...] "has visual splendor galore, but <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> work {{lacking in the}} {{requisite}} tension and suspense". McCarthy considered Cruise as [...] "a bit stiff but still adequate" [...] as von Stauffenberg. The critic believed that McQuarrie's script was well-carpentered but felt that compressing and streamlining the events to make a known failed plot more thrilling lacked a [...] "sufficient sizzle into the dialogue or individuality into the characters". McCarthy missed [...] "many of the interesting personal and political nuances pertaining to these men" [...] that were not detailed. He thought that the production design by Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb stood out, that Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography had a [...] "restrained elegance", and that John Ottman performed well in his dual role as editor and composer. A similar sentiment was stated by Mike LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle, who wrote [...] "There's nothing inherently laughable about the spectacle of Tom Cruise with an eye patch and a missing hand, strutting around in a German colonel's uniform. But neither is there anything about him that truly suggests Claus von Stauffenberg, leader of the 1944 conspiracy to decapitate the Nazi government and stage a coup d'etat. Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. Do that, and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie.|$|E
500|$|As an Irishwoman, Streep acted {{opposite}} Michael Gambon and Catherine McCormack in Pat O'Connor's Dancing at Lughnasa (1998), {{which was}} {{entered into the}} Venice Film Festival in its year of release. [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times remarked that [...] "Meryl Streep has made many a grand acting gesture in her career, but the way she simply peers out a window in Dancing at Lughnasa ranks with the best. Everything the viewer need know about Kate Mundy, the woman she plays here, is written on that prim, lonely face and its flabbergasted gaze". Later that year, Streep played a cancer sufferer caught in a difficult family situation, playing the mother of Renée Zellweger and wife of William Hurt in One True Thing. The film gained positive reviews. Mick LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle declared: [...] "After 'One True Thing', critics who persist in the fiction that Streep <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> and technical actress will need to get their heads examined. She is so instinctive and natural – so thoroughly in the moment and operating on flights of inspiration – that she's able {{to give us a}} woman who's at once wildly idiosyncratic and utterly believable." [...] Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan noted that Streep's role [...] "is one of the least self-consciously dramatic and surface showy of her career" [...] but that she [...] "adds a level of honesty and reality that makes [...] one of her most moving".|$|E
