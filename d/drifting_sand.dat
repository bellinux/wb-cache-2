In 1568, some 350 fishing boats and merchant ships were wrecked {{off the coast}} of Skagen. In the 1590s, successive storms led not only to numerous drownings but to flooding, destroying many of the houses. In 1591, 22 died in a flood and in 1593, 14 houses were washed away. In 1595, 25 farms in the area were covered in <b>drifting</b> <b>sand.</b> As a result, new housing was built in Østerby to the north east, away from the rapidly accumulating sand.|$|E

Fish native to Moses Lake indicate some periods of connection before 1904. It is possible that sand dunes created Moses Lake by blocking Crab Creek.|$|E
40|$|Inland active <b>drift</b> <b>sand</b> landscapes are {{regarded}} as unique ecosystems of great historical and geomorphological value. Recent studies have highlighted the role of multiple factors in the initiation and stabilization of <b>drift</b> <b>sand</b> landscapes. To unravel the importance of different forcings (e. g. agricultural practices, climate) and their interplay, insight in the chronology of <b>drift</b> <b>sand</b> dynamics is essential. In this study, we aimed to reconstruct {{the dynamics of the}} <b>drift</b> <b>sand</b> landscape of the Wekeromse Zand (central Netherlands) and to develop a conceptual model to understand the processes involved. The Wekeromse Zand study area is located on the border of a central push moraine and is characterised by open active <b>drift</b> <b>sands</b> and vegetated hills and valleys. The surroundings are dominated by modern agricultural practices, and remnants from ancient iron age Celtic Field systems. For the study area we: i) analysed historical maps going back to the early 19 th century, ii) performed a field survey to map the palaeolandscape (before <b>drift</b> <b>sand</b> activation) and iii) employed optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of <b>drift</b> <b>sand</b> deposits on 11 samples from two locations to determine the timing of <b>drift</b> <b>sand</b> deposition. Analysis of the available topographic maps showed no substantial aeolean activity of the area outside its morphological boundaries. OSL dating revealed that two <b>drift</b> <b>sand</b> layers were deposited between 1373 and 1462 AD and between 1680 and 1780 AD. The Wekeromse Zand has known three relatively stable periods: i) a period between the start of the Holocene to the Late Medieval Period, ii) in between the Medieval climatic optimum and the climatic Maunder minimum, and iii) current situation. The two active phases appear to correspond with active phases in the coastal dune systems and are probably the combined result of anthropogenic land use and climatic changes...|$|R

25|$|The {{greater part}} (about 58%) of the Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve {{consists}} of woods, primarily pine forests, which were {{planted in the}} second half of the 19th century on former heathland and <b>drifting</b> <b>sand.</b> In some cases the dunes simply became naturally overgrown, again with pines. There are only a very few old stands of sessile oaks, which stem from the logging industry during the time of the Kingdom of Hanover. In many parts of the nature reserve there are so-called Stühbüsche (a form of coppice), trees that were coppiced by repeatedly being cut short. In the meantime they have grown wild again and have a characteristic and unusual appearance with their multiple trunks. Near Wilsede there is the remnant of a Hutewald, a wood pasture with giant, multi-stemmed beech trees.|$|E
25|$|Greenland {{was always}} colder in winter than Iceland and Norway, and its terrain less hospitable to agriculture. Erosion {{of the soil}} was a danger from the beginning, one that the Greenland {{settlements}} may not have recognized {{until it was too}} late. For an extended time, nonetheless, the relatively warm West Greenland current flowing northwards along the southwestern coast of Greenland made it feasible for the Norse to farm much as their relatives did in Iceland or northern Norway. Palynologists' tests on pollen counts and fossilized plants prove that the Greenlanders must have struggled with soil erosion and deforestation. A Norse farm in the Vatnahverfi district, excavated in the 1950s, had been buried in layers of <b>drifting</b> <b>sand</b> up to 10 feet deep. As the unsuitability of the land for agriculture became more and more patent, the Greenlanders resorted first to pastoralism and then to hunting for their food. But they never learned to use the hunting techniques of the Inuit, one being a farming culture, the other living on hunting in more northern areas with pack ice.|$|E

40|$|Questions (1) At what rate does {{succession}} {{take place}} in active and more stabilized <b>drift</b> <b>sands</b> in regions with low and high N deposition in the Netherlands? (2) What is the present composition of pioneer vegetation in active and more stabilized <b>drift</b> <b>sands</b> in regions with low and high N deposition? (3) What efforts are necessary to conserve bare <b>sand</b> in <b>drift</b> <b>sands?</b> Location Eight inland dunes in the Netherlands, which represent four active and four more stabilized <b>drift</b> <b>sands</b> in regions with low and high N deposition. Methods Aerial photographs from 1950, 1981, 1995 and 2007 were used to compare rates of succession from bare sand towards forest. For each site, a detailed vegetation map was made in 2007. Results In all studied sites, bare sand decreased, especially in regions with high N deposition. This decline was significantly higher between 1981 and 2007 than between 1950 and 1981. The loss of bare sand {{did not lead to}} an increase of pioneer vegetation, which remained more or less stable; it led, however, to an increase of heath and forest. In active <b>drift</b> <b>sands,</b> pioneer vegetation was characterized by Corynephorus canescens and Polytrichum piliferum, while lichens, lichen-rich grassland and Campylopus introflexus were more common in stabilized <b>drift</b> <b>sands.</b> In regions with high N deposition, the proportion of Campylopus introflexus to older pioneer stages was significantly higher, and the contribution of forest to the ‘heath/forest’ vegetation class was also higher. The calculated life span of bare sand decreased in all sites. Extrapolation of the results suggests that in the absence of restoration measures, bare sand will vanish by 2035. Conclusions In both active and more stabilized <b>drift</b> <b>sands,</b> a generic loss of bare sand and an increase in forest area was found. The increase was higher in regions with high N deposition. Conservation management should include the annual transformation of 43 ha of forest into bare sand in order to stop the loss of bare sand...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{possibilities}} of applying the analysis of laser altimetry images to Dutch <b>drift</b> <b>sands.</b> All along the European Sand Belt, which stretches from Great Britain to the Ural Mountains, Late Glacial cover sands, river dunes and other ice-age deposits were reactivated as <b>drift</b> <b>sand</b> during the Holocene. New insights were obtained in three aspects of drift-sands geomorphology. First, the variety in forms of drift-sand landscapes {{is often described as}} chaotic. Laser altimetry images show that complex clusters are formed elongated {{in the direction of the}} prevailing SW wind and consisting of three zones which correspond to the successive aspects of the aeolian process: deflation, transport and deposition (dune formation). In densely populated areas, this structure has been ruined by human activities. Second, contrary to common belief, the drift-sand cells expanded against the prevailing SW wind whereas the characteristic comb dunes at the opposite NE edge remained fixed by vegetation. Third, the authors questioned the view that <b>drift</b> <b>sands</b> are due to anthropogenic activities. The origin of <b>drift</b> <b>sands</b> can best be explained by the climate with violent storms in the first part of the past millennium...|$|R

40|$|Restoration {{management}} of degraded <b>drift</b> <b>sand</b> on the Deelensche Zand: The Deelensche Zand (part of the National Park De Hoge Veluwe, {{in the central}} part of the Netherlands) consisted of lichen-rich <b>drift</b> <b>sand</b> in the past, but is partly grass-encroached in the present. In 2001 a sieving machine (so-called beach <b>sand</b> cleaner or <b>drift</b> <b>sand</b> cleaner) was applied in order to regain the lichen-rich pioneer communities with Corynephorus canescens (grey hair grass). For that purpose the vegetation and the upper soil layer were scraped off from five plots <b>drift</b> <b>sand,</b> encroached with Deschampsia flexuosa and Agrostis vinealis. The subsequent changes in vegetation and soil were monitored until June 2008. In those seven years, the short grassland with Corynephorus canescens has been restored, however it had a high moss cover. In some plots the main moss cover consisted of Polytrichum piliferum, in others it was Campylopus introflexus. On the mats of the latter species the more common lichen species appeared, the more rare species occurred on the mats of the former species. The application of the sieving machine is especially useful in the early stages of grass encroachment when the moss cover is not too dense and the soil profile less developed...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands {{the total}} active inland drift-sand {{area has been}} declining rapidly during the last 50 years. To {{preserve}} the inland <b>drift</b> <b>sands,</b> {{it is necessary to}} understand its origin and development and the role of human activity in this semi-natural ecotype. The objective of this literature review is to describe the development of the drift-sand ecotopes, to explain the rapid decline of the active <b>drift</b> <b>sands,</b> and to develop a management strategy for the remaining active <b>drift</b> <b>sands.</b> Inland drift-sand landscapes are relatively young landscapes of Holocene age. They often occur as oval-shaped cells with a length of 1. 5 to over 6 km {{in the direction of the}} prevailing wind. These cells presumably represent reactivated deposits of Younger Cover Sands. Large-scale erosion events in combination with human activity suppressed the development of vegetation. After the change in land use in the first half of the 20 th century in which most of the <b>drift</b> <b>sands</b> were re-afforested, the vegetation succession started to show a progressive development. In this stage inland drift-sand ecotopes developed in most of the remaining <b>drift</b> <b>sands</b> with all forms of the typical succession stages from bare sand to forest. The rate at which this development took place mainly depended on the geomorphological development stage of the area, the area size and human activity. Since the 1960 s the increased nitrogen deposition has accelerated the vegetation succession, not only resulting in a further decline of the <b>drift</b> <b>sands,</b> but also in a loss of the fragile balance between the different ecotopes and loss of its typical habitants like the Tree Grayling and Tawny Pipit. Most drift-sand vegetation and fauna need the presence of bare sand nearby and a certain level of erosion activity to survive. To preserve the drift-sand ecotype, it is therefore recommended to keep the area affected by erosion sufficiently large (process management). In the meantime one should also `maintain' or increase the wind force in the drift-sand area by suppressing the growth of high vegetation and removing trees, which form a wind barrier. In areas which are less suitable for reactivation, one could restore the mosaic vegetation by removing the vegetation on a limited scale (pattern management). More research is needed to develop a more balanced management strategy and to develop a management tool for the managers of inland <b>drift</b> <b>sands.</b> Also the role of the increased nitrogen deposition in the regeneration process needs further investigation in order to find an effective way to suppress its effect. The development of management strategies for the Dutch inland <b>drift</b> <b>sands</b> might be of great value to drift-sand areas in Western Europe where nature conservationists start to show more interest in the restoration of former drift-sand areas...|$|R
40|$|Man has had {{a complex}} {{relationship}} with inland <b>drift</b> <b>sands</b> through the ages.

In this book you may find these different views on <b>drift</b> <b>sand</b> landscapes through time: The processes, origin, conservation and at present even restoration of this very special but harsh biotope. Next to the relationship with man, ecology is highlighted starting from restraint to restoration. Characteristic fields of lichens with sparse grasses and heather form the biotope of a range of special animal and plant species, as well as rare mushrooms. Their commonality is that all of these species can cope with the extreme conditions in the <b>drift</b> <b>sands,</b> and are able to survive. Gradients from bare sand to forest stands shape the habitat for a specific biodiversity.
