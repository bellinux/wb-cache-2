40|$|We {{assess the}} impact on {{emigration}} flows of trade liberalization in a sending country. The paper adopts a case study approach focusing on Morocco, which is well suited for the purpose in hand {{as it has been}} a substantial provider of migrants to Europe and has recently undergone a fairly comprehensive trade liberalization. We develop a simple macroeconometric model to assess how trade liberalization affects employment, output and income; the fundamental determinants of migrant supply in the sending countries in the short to medium run. We find that trade liberalization will free pent-up demand for imports and induce a real exchange rate depreciation. In turn, a lower real exchange rate will depress output and employment on the one hand, but boost labour-intensive exports and labour demand on the other. Our simulations suggest that the latter effect dominates so that trade liberalization is found to promote employment creation and through this channel, discourage migrations even in the short run. If trade liberalization is supported from abroad through a <b>foreign</b> <b>grant,</b> however, our results show that the real exchange rate will depreciate less, export expansion will be more limited and migrations may even increase.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of research is}} to find out (1) the background of monetary policy enactment in Soeharto times during 1966 - 1971; (2) the monetary policy in Soeharto times during 1966 - 1971; (3) the implementation of monetary policy in Soeharto times during 1966 - 1971; and (4) the impact of monetary policy in Soeharto times on the economical and political sectors during 1966 - 1971. This research used a historical method. The data source employed was written primary and secondary sources. The data of research was collected using literary study technique. Technique of collecting data employed in this study was a historical analysis technique. The research procedure included heuristic, criticism, interpretation, and historiography. Based on the result of research, it can be conclusion that: (1) the background of monetary policy enactment in Soeharto times during 1966 - 1971 was the monetary riots, the production disruption, commercial balance deficit, as well as the government’s increased budget deficit, foreign debt, demoralization, all of which are the inheritances from Soekarno government; (2) the monetary policy in Soeharto times during 1966 - 1971 was based on the MPRS Provision No. XXIII/MPRS/ 1966 on July 5 about the Reformation of Economical, Financial and Development Foundation Policy. Such MRS provision required an integral economic-financial policy, pertaining two inseparable sides: physical production and monetary aspects. Therefore, New Order government undertook an economical policy prioritizing the monetary stability by making monetary policy coordination, fiscal policy or other macroeconomic policy supporting the economical stabilization and rehabilitation; (3) the implementation of monetary policy in Soeharto times during 1966 - 1971 began with the scheduling of foreign debt and asking for <b>foreign</b> <b>grant</b> to create a balanced budget and to recover Indonesian economy. Along with it, the government made the attempts of saving mobilization, credit distribution to the priority sectors in economy, and adjustment of high interest rate as well as the recovery of single exchange value; (4) the impact of monetary policy in Soeharto times on the economical and political sectors during 1966 - 1971 in economic sector included the success of reducing the growth rate of circulating money and inflation rate, the improvement of public saving mobilization, balanced budget establishment, the more stable export and import value corresponding to Indonesian economic requirement and the recovery of capital flow to home. The impact in political sector included: (a) New Order Government used economic development to strengthen its legitimacy; (b) New Order Government created civil bureaucracy that was effective and loyal to the executive power to support the economic development program; (c) New Order occurred as the authoritarian bureaucratic country (NBO) as the consequence of political stability establishment supporting the economic development; and (d) the dependency on Mafia Berkeley andforeign aid...|$|E
40|$|The {{transformation}} of the 1990 s has had a bearing on the academic and scientific world, as is becoming increasingly obvious with the changing numbers of foreign students wishing to study in the Czech Republic and of Czech students wishing to study abroad, the virtual collapse of doctoral studies, and the rapidly increasing age of Czech academics (placed at 48 by official sources and at rather more by this research). At {{the same time there}} is an apparent lack of interest in analysing and understanding these trends, which Mr. Cermak terms an ostrich policy, although his research showed that academics are in fact both aware and concerned about them. The mid- 1990 s migration of talent to and from R+D in the Czech Republic is also reflected in the number of talented Czech students studying abroad, who represent the largest and most interesting group of actual and potential migrants. Mr. Cermak's study took the form of a Delphi enquiry participated in by 44 specialists, including experts in the problems of higher education and science policy from the Presidium of the Higher Education Council (n = 23), members of the Council's Science and Research Commission (n = 14), former and current managers of higher education authorities (n = 4) and selected participants of the longitudinal talent research (n = 3). Questions considered included the influence of continuing talent migration from domestic R+D on the efficiency of domestic higher education, the diversification of forms of the brain drain and their impact on other processes in society, the possibility of positive influence on the brain drain processes to minimise the risks it presents, {{and the use of the}} knowledge obtained about the brain drain. The study revealed a clear drop of interest in brain drain problems in higher education in the mid- 1990 s, which is probably related to the collapsed of Czech R+D in the field of talent education. The effects on this segment of the labour market appeared earlier, with a major migration wave in 1991 - 1993 which significantly "cleared" the area of scientific talent. In addition, prospective talents from the ranks of younger students have not been integrated into domestic R+D, leading to the increasing average age of those working in this field. "Talent scouting" tended to be oriented towards much younger individuals, even in some cases towards undergraduate students. The R+D institutions deprived of human resources considered as basic in a functional R+D system have lost much of their dynamism and so no longer attract not only domestic talent but also talent from other regions. As a result the public, including the mass media and political structures, have stopped regarding the support of domestic science as a priority. This is clear both among the young people who are important for the future development of R+D (support for the education of talented children has dropped), from the drop in the prestige of this area as a profession among university students, and from the lack of explicit support for R+D by any of the political parties. On the basis of his findings Mr. Cermak concludes that there is no basis for the belief that the brain drain will represent a positive force in stimulating the development of the open society. Migration data shows that the outflow of talent from the Czech Republic far exceeds the inflow, and that the latter is largely short-term. Not only has the number of returning Czech professors dropped to half of its level at the beginning of the 1990 s, but they also tend to take up only short-term contracts and retain their foreign positions. Recruitment of scientific talent from other countries, including the Slovak Republic, is limited. Furthermore internal contacts between those already involved in R+D have been badly hit by economic pressures and institutional co-operation has dropped to a minimum. There have been few moves to counteract this situation, the only notable one being the Program 250, launched in 1996 with government support to try and attract younger (i. e. under 40) talent into R+D. Its resources are however limited and its effects have not so far been evaluated. The deficit of academic and scientific talent in the Czech Republic is increasing and two major directions of academic work are emerging. Classic higher education science based on the teaching process is declining, largely due to economic factors, while there is an increasing emphasis on special; ad hoc projects which cannot be related directly to teaching but are often interesting to specialists outside the Czech Republic. This is shown clearly by the increase in publishing and in participation in domestic and <b>foreign</b> <b>grant</b> projects, which often serve to supplement the otherwise low salaries in the higher education sector. This tend was also accelerated by the collapse of applied R+D in individual sectors of the national economy and by substantial cutbacks in the Czech Academy of Sciences, which formerly fostered such research. Some part of the output of this research can be used in the education system and its financial contribution does significantly affect the stability of the present staff, but Mr. Cermak sees it as generally unfavourable for the development of talent education. In addition, it has led to a certain resignation on the question of integration into international structures, due to the emphasis on short-term targets, commercial advantages and individualism rather than team work. At the same time, he admits that these developments reflect those in other areas of the transformation in the Czech Republic...|$|E

Results show that <b>foreign</b> <b>grants</b> have indeed lowered domestic revenue collection but they have also been an important source of debt reduction. In some circumstances aid has improved the composition of government expenditure but the revenue and debt repayment effects mean that it has had a weak effect on increasing overall expenditure levels.
