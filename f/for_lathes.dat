25|$|There {{are many}} types of collet used in the {{metalworking}} industry. Common industry-standard designs are R8 (internally threaded for mills) and 5C (usually externally threaded <b>for</b> <b>lathes).</b> There are also proprietary designs which only fit one manufacturer's equipment. Collets can range in holding capacity from zero to several inches in diameter. The {{most common type of}} collet grips a round bar or tool, but there are collets for square, hexagonal, and other shapes. In addition to the outside-holding collets, there are collets used for holding a part on its inside surface {{so that it can be}} machined on the outside surface (similar to an expanding mandrel). Furthermore, it is not uncommon for machinists to make a custom collet to hold any unusual size or shape of part. These are often called emergency collets (e-collets) or soft collets (from the fact that they are bought in a soft (unhardened) state and machined as needed). Yet another type of collet is a step collet which steps up to a larger diameter from the spindle and allows holding of larger workpieces.|$|E

Mathematical model was established for a chosen work piece profile and based on it a program was written, whereby technical documentation was generated for prismatic form tool.

In 1861, he patented the Kinematoscope (United States Patent 31357), a protean development in the history of film. His invention in 1866 of feed-disks <b>for</b> <b>lathes</b> or other machine tools was the first practical solution of the problem of the infinite gradation of feeds. His other patents relate chiefly to improved forms of tools or modifications of existing machines. The use of absorbent cotton for surgical operations was recommended by him as early as 1861, and he proposed the employment of glycerine in order to keep photographic plates wet.|$|E
50|$|Milling can be {{done with}} a wide range of machine tools. The {{original}} class of machine tools for milling was the milling machine (often called a mill). After the advent of computer numerical control (CNC), milling machines evolved into machining centers (milling machines with automatic tool changers, tool magazines or carousels, CNC control, coolant systems, and enclosures), generally classified as vertical machining centers (VMCs) and horizontal machining centers (HMCs). The integration of milling into turning environments and of turning into milling environments, begun with live tooling <b>for</b> <b>lathes</b> and the occasional use of mills for turning operations, led to a new class of machine tools, multitasking machines (MTMs), which are purpose-built to provide for a default machining strategy of using any combination of milling and turning within the same work envelope.|$|E

5000|$|Woodturning {{has always}} had a strong {{hobbyist}} presence. In the 1970s, an explosion of interest in hobby woodturning in the English-speaking world sparked a revival in the craft. Dr. Dale Nish travelled to England to recruit teachers, tools, and techniques from the last of the apprentice-trained woodturners. A few years later, Canadian Stephen Hogbin spent a year in Australia, pushing the limits of the craft through changes in scale and design. Industrial arts teachers used their institutional affiliation to create seminars, publish books, and foster research. The tool industry identified a new market <b>for</b> <b>lathes</b> and turning tools. A small group of serious collectors invested in the increasingly sculptural explorations of woodturners. It is unusual that woodturning never established a strong foothold in university departments of art and design. Instead, practitioners of the craft have become adept at learning from demonstrations, private classes, regional meetings, their own published journals, and internet technologies. Some artists began as woodturners, and moved into more sculptural work, experimenting with super object forms and other fine craft concepts. The Center for Art in Wood, founded in 1986 as The Wood Turning Center, houses a collection in Philadelphia with over 1,000 objects from international artists [...] as well as a research library and gallery. [...] Other turners have chosen an artisan-based focus on traditional work, custom work, and the pleasure of studio practice.|$|E

The article presents the research results referring {{to the analysis of}} the influence of finish treatment (finishing turning, grinding, burnishing) on the friction properties of steel applied to marine pump shafts. The research was performed on a roller 39 mm in diameter made of 304 L stainless steel. The finish tooling of pump shaft pins was carry out on a universal centre lathe. The finish turning process was carried out by means of a WING WF 080408 Sandvik Coromant cutting tool with replaceable inserts. The grinding process was performed by grinding attachment <b>for</b> <b>lathes.</b> The 1 – 80 x 10 x 32 – 99 C 80 -N V grinding wheel was used for the process. The process of burnishing was done by SRMD single roll burnishing tool by Yamato. The burnishing process was carried out at the following technological parameters: burnishing force 1. 1 kN, burnishing speed 35 m/min, feed 0. 13 mm/rev. In addition, the influence of the number of burnishing tool passes on the friction was determined.
