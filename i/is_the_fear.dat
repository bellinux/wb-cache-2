Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and perceptions of an ingroup towards an outgroup, including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} reasons for {{opposing}} the return <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of the costs it would bring. According to another poll conducted by Helsingin Sanomat, 42% of Finns opposing the return list that as the most important single reason. The standard of living on the Russian side of the border is much lower than on the Finnish side. The GDP (PPP) per capita in Finland is about double that of Russia.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately {{the purpose}} of the {{campaign}} was to get grocery stores to donate the food they would otherwise throw away. The primary reason corporations have given for not donating their excess food <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of liability if someone gets sick from eating it. The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, shields food donors from liability and a 2013 study by the University of Arkansas School of Law shows {{there has not been a}} single case that involved food donation-related liability for a grocery store.|$|E

25|$|Israel has {{a common}} law legal system. Its basic {{principles}} are {{inherited from the}} law of the British Mandate of Palestine and thus resemble those of British and American law, namely: the role of courts in creating the body of law and the authority of the supreme court in reviewing and if necessary overturning legislative and executive decisions, as well as employing the adversarial system. One of the primary reasons that the Israeli constitution remains unwritten <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> by whatever party holds power that creating a written constitution, combined with the common-law elements, would severely limit the powers of the Knesset (which, following the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, holds near-unlimited power).|$|E
25|$|The second {{interpretation}} is that Chen's actions were primarily intended to placate his core supporters rather than provoke a crisis. People who subscribe to this interpretation {{point out that}} Chen's early efforts to moderate his pro-independence position did not create a positive reaction either from the PRC or from his anti-independence opponents on Taiwan. He also alienated some pro-independence supporters. Therefore, Chen was forced {{to take a more}} assertive approach both as a negotiation tactic with the PRC and to keep support from his core supporters. This strategy is consistent with the oft-stated position that Taiwan would only seek independence as a preemptive measure in the face of evidence of PRC military aggression. However, even this interpretation provokes unease among many people, especially among policy makers in the PRC and the United States. The first problem is that this interpretation makes Chen seem like an old-style Taiwan politician that seems to say whatever pleases people. The second, more serious problem <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that through misunderstanding and misinterpretation, Chen may have provoked a war without intending to do so, as the PRC has repeatedly claimed that any progress towards independence would provoke war.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Foreign Policy {{mentioned}} {{that a big}} portion of the Sunni community think of Rajab as a troublemaker. The majority sect in Bahrain is Shia Muslims, Sunni Muslims comprise a substantial minority and hold the top positions of power. The largest opposition party is Al Wefaq which is a Shia Islamist movement (albeit internationally recognized as moderate and tightly allied with secular opposition parties). [...] One source of opposition to [...] Rajab (who has taken anti-sectarian stands) and his movement <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> (particularly among Sunnis) that they could bring Shia Islamists to power.|$|E

It may <b>be</b> taken for <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that <b>is</b> wrought in <b>the</b> godly by the Spirit as a spirit of bondage; or, 4.

500|$|Traditionally, at common law, natural {{justice is}} taken to be a {{procedural}} concept that embodies the twin pillars of audi alteram partem (hear the other party) and nemo iudex in causa sua (no one should be a judge {{in his or her}} own cause). In the United States, due process has both procedural and substantive components. Substantive due process involves the courts assessing the reasonableness of executive actions and legislation using rational basis review if a fundamental right is not implicated and strict scrutiny if it is. The question thus arises whether substantive fundamental rules of natural justice may be developed by local courts. However, a line of Malaysian cases has expressed the view that the concept of substantive due process is not applicable to Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). There is also academic commentary that rejects the notion of [...] "substantive natural justice", arguing that it is too vague and leads to problems in application. Another argument against substantive natural justice <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that it may become an avenue for judges to invalidate laws on the basis of their own subjective opinions, leading to unbounded judicial activism.|$|E
2500|$|The third treasure, daring {{not be at}} the world's front, is the Taoist way {{to avoid}} {{premature}} death. To be at the world's front is to expose oneself, to render oneself vulnerable to the world's destructive forces, while to remain behind and to be humble is to allow oneself time to fully ripen and bear fruit. This is a treasure whose secret spring <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of losing one's life before one's time. This fear of death, out of a love for life, is indeed the key to Taoist wisdom. (1989:209) ...|$|E

One of those <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of teeth being broken, which I used in my first film. Another is the claw of an animal, like a saber-toothed tiger reaching with its tremendous hooks. I transposed this into a human hand. The original script had the blades being fishing knives." ...|$|E

[...] His ambition turns to destroying Batman, about whom he had heard stories from an inmate. Gotham fascinates Bane because, like Peña Dura, fear rules Gotham - but it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Batman. [...] Bane is convinced that Batman is a personification of the demonic bat which had haunted his dreams since childhood. [...] Therefore, Bane believes fate placed Batman {{on a collision course with}} him.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{critics of}} Japanese Hip Hop {{believe that it}} simply follows {{a long line of}} Black music that {{ultimately}} gained popularity through a different ethnic group mimicking the music. The [...] "Elvis Effect" [...] occurs [...] "when white participation in traditionally black avenues of cultural production produces feelings of unease." [...] It occurs whenever a white person attempts a historically black art-form, is discovered to critical acclaim, and this is what leads to that art-form receiving widespread commercial acceptance. Aside from Elvis Presley, notable examples throughout music history include Dave Brubeck, Eric Clapton, and Eminem. Many critics believe that this concept is relevant to Japanese and other forms of global Hip Hop. If listeners first discover Hip Hop through a Japanese artist, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that they will never bother learning about Hip Hop's origins and simply continue to listen to strictly Japanese versions of the genre.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{critical}} issue with the commercialization of personalised medicine is the protection of patients. One of the largest issues <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> and potential consequences for patients who are predisposed after genetic testing or found to be non-responsive towards certain treatments. This includes the psychological effects on patients due to genetic testing results. The right of family members who do not directly consent is another issue, considering that genetic predispositions and risks are inheritable. The implications for certain ethnic groups and presence of a common allele {{would also have to}} be considered. [...] In 2008, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in an effort to minimize the fear of patients participating in genetic research by ensuring that their genetic information will not be misused by employers or insurers. On February 19, 2015 FDA issued a press release titled: [...] "FDA permits marketing of first direct-to-consumer genetic carrier test for Bloom syndrome.|$|E

50|$|Some {{possible}} explanations of gephyrophobia may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of driving off <b>the</b> bridge, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of {{a gust of}} wind taking one off <b>the</b> bridge, a <b>fear</b> of <b>the</b> structural integrity of the bridges itself, or <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that <b>the</b> bridge will collapse if they try to cross it. <b>The</b> <b>fear</b> overlaps with acrophobia, <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of heights, as gephyrophobia tends to be exacerbated in tall bridges vs. ones close to the water/ground beneath.|$|R
