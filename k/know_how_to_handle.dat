5|$|After {{his release}} from prison in 2010, Chen was placed under house arrest against Chinese law, and was closely {{monitored}} by security forces. Legally, he was proclaimed {{by the government to}} be a free man, but in reality the local government offered no explanation for the hundreds of unidentified agents monitoring his house and preventing visitors or escape. The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion over the issue, and suggested that the local government may not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> it, but no disciplinary action was taken at the national level.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{argued that}} Sheila was the killer, {{and that she}} did <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> guns, {{because she had been}} raised on a farm and had {{attended}} shoots when she was younger. She had a very serious mental illness, had told a psychiatrist she felt capable of killing her children, and the loaded rifle and cartridges had been left on the kitchen table by Bamber. There had been a recent family argument about placing the children in foster care.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} {{settlers}} of the municipality, the Islanders {{and their descendants}} were designated hidalgos. The established settlers resented the Islanders for their new titles and exclusive privileges within the city government. The newcomers did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> horses, rendering them useless in mounted warfare against the Apaches. Unlike the established settlers, who relied on ranching, the Islanders were primarily farmers, and their refusal to build fences led to many disagreements when livestock trampled the fields. By the early 1740s, however, intermarriage {{and the need for}} closer economic ties had helped to alleviate some of the infighting, and the original settlers were given permission to serve as magistrates and council members.|$|E

5|$|News of {{the death}} spreads, and the interns hurry to his room to find a shocked Stevens, lying on the bed, {{clinging}} to his still form. As they each try to comfort her, {{the cause of his}} death is revealed to have been a blood clot that led to a fatal stroke. Stevens says that if she had taken less time to dress, she would have arrived at his room sooner and could have been with him while he died. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) then talks to Stevens, picking her up and hugging her. Afterward, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), who did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> Burke's situation, goes to his room and puts her hand on his to show him her support. As the episode ends, Stevens confesses to Webber that she was the one responsible for the LVAD wire cut, and claiming she cannot be a surgeon, quits the program. After everyone begins going their separate ways, Grey remains torn on who she should follow: Shepherd or Dandridge.|$|E
25|$|Frank (Joe Cheng) is a {{young man}} who wears {{designer}} labels and thinks he's rather suave when he is actually poor.

He considers pawning his mother's wedding ring, the only thing he had left of hers, but he couldn't do it.|$|E

500|$|The {{collapse}} {{was heavily}} condemned. Fingleton said England [...] "encountered something [...] {{which they had}} not known in post-war cricket with Australia and did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> it". O'Reilly called the capitulation a [...] "disgustingly bad show". He asked what [...] "was there to make bowlers...pulverize the carefully chosen cream of English batting on a perfect wicket?" [...] before concluding that the collapse was caused by [...] "an unfortunate absence of concentration" [...] rather than the opposition bowling. Both thought England had wasted an opportunity to put themselves in an unassailable position.|$|E
500|$|... "Before {{all this}} came about {{we had our}} own method of dealing with law-breakers and in {{settling}} disputes between members. That all changed when Crow Dog killed Spotted Tail. Of course, our method of dealing with that was Crow Dog should go take care of Spotted Tail's family, and if he didn't do that we'd banish him from the tribe. But that was considered too barbaric, and thought perhaps we should hang him like civilized people do, so they passed the Major Crimes Act that said we don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> murderers {{and they were going}} to show us." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} primarily positive reviews, with critical attention mostly {{going to}} Veronica and Logan's relationship. Price Peterson of TV.com gave the episode a positive review, noting that [...] "bviously {{the most notable}} aspect of this episode was the Logan-Veronica hookup. Again, it seemed really sudden, but {{in the sense that}} they are both mercurial teenagers it seemed right, particularly when they didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> themselves afterward."

500|$|Some commentators, while {{noting the}} {{popularity}} of Colbert's dinner speech, were critical of the perceived snubbing he was receiving from the press corps, {{even though he was}} the featured entertainer for the evening. The Washington Post columnist Dan Froomkin, calling it [...] "The Colbert Blackout", lambasted the traditional media for ignoring Colbert while focusing on the [...] "much safer" [...] topic of President Bush's routine with Bridges. [...] Amy Goodman of Democracy Now noted that initial coverage ignored Colbert entirely. Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism professor Todd Gitlin remarked, [...] "It's too hot to handle. [...] was scathing toward Bush and it was absolutely devastating.

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series. Keith DeCandido for Tor.com {{described}} the episode as [...] "a nasty episode that doesn't quite cohere into the level of nasty it could", but that the series [...] "doesn't do horror/action all that often, and it serves as a good change of pace if nothing else". He gave [...] "Conspiracy" [...] a score of four out of ten. Zack Handlen, who reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club, thought that while [...] "Conspiracy" [...] was a [...] "hard episode to forget", it was not quite as good as he remembered and did not quite [...] "fit" [...] with the rest of the season. He thought that certain parts of the plot were [...] "idiotic", and the Admirals reminded him of a [...] "Bond villain convention". He gave the episode an overall grade of B, writing, [...] "fingers crossed that next time we encounter a danger this sinister, the writers <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> it".|$|E

2500|$|When {{the news}} of the Greek Revolution was first received, the {{reaction}} of the European powers was uniformly hostile.

Afraid of the complications the partition of the empire might raise, the British foreign minister Viscount Castlereagh, Austrian foreign minister Prince Metternich, and the Tsar of Russia Alexander I shared the same view concerning the necessity of preserving the status quo and the peace of Europe. They also pleaded that they maintain the Concert of Europe.|$|E
2500|$|... "Before {{we go on}} the {{offensive}} politically or militarily we take the greatest defensive precautions possible to ensure success, e.g. we do not advocate a United Ireland {{without being able to}} justify our right to such a state as opposed to partition; we do not employ revolutionary violence as our means without being able to illustrate that we have no recourse to any other means. Or in more everyday simple terms: we do not claim {{that we are going to}} escalate the war if we cannot do just that; we do not mount an operation without first having ensured that we have taken the necessary defensive precautions of accurate intelligence, security, that weapons are in proper working order with proper ammunition and that the volunteers involved <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> interrogations in the event of their capture etc, and of course that the operation itself enhances rather than alienates our supporters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Self-concept {{is a term}} {{referring}} to the whole sum of beliefs that people have about themselves. However, what specifically does self-concept consist of? According to Hazel Markus (1977), the self-concept {{is made up of}} cognitive molecules called self-schemas– beliefs that people have about themselves that guide the processing of self-reliant information. For example, an athlete at a university would have multiple selves that would process different information pertinent to each self: the student would be one [...] "self," [...] who would process information pertinent to a student (taking notes in class, completing a homework assignment, etc.); the athlete would be the [...] "self" [...] who processes information about things related to being an athlete (recognizing an incoming pass, aiming a shot, etc.). These [...] "selves" [...] are part of one's identity and the self-reliant information is the information that relies on the proper [...] "self" [...] to process and react on it. If a [...] "self" [...] is not part of one's identity, then it is much more difficult for one to react. For example, a civilian may not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> a hostile threat as a trained Marine would. The Marine contains a [...] "self" [...] that would enable him/her to process the information about the hostile threat and react accordingly, whereas a civilian may not contain that self, disabling them from properly processing the information from the hostile threat and, furthermore, debilitating them from acting accordingly. Self-schemas are to an individual’s total self–concept as a hypothesis is to a theory, or a book is to a library. A good example is the body weight self-schema; people who regard themselves as over or underweight, or for those whom body image is a significant self-concept aspect, are considered schematics with respect to weight. For these people a range of otherwise mundane events– grocery shopping, new clothes, eating out, or going to the beach– can trigger thoughts about the self. In contrast, people who do not regard their weight as an important part of their lives are a-schematic on that attribute.|$|E
