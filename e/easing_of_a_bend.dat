40|$|The {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bend</b> on {{the fluid}} transients propagated by a rapid valve closure {{in a long}} pipeline is examined by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> short dimensional analysis and <b>a</b> comprehensive series <b>of</b> experimental tests designed to record the effects of varying in turn: the pipeline diameter to thickness ratio (7. 35 to 48), pipe elasticity to fluid bulk modulus ratio (0. 27 to 93. 6), the restraint applied to the pipeline, the bend radius of curvature to pipe bore ratio (0 to 5), the included angle of the bend (0 " to 135 ") and the initial flow velocity. From these tests the influence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bend</b> {{is found to be}} solely dependent on its geometry.
