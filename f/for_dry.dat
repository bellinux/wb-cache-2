40|$|The study {{assessed}} the molluscicidal and piscicidal activities of castor plant Ricinus communis using its fruit (dried and fresh) against {{large and small}} golden apple Snails (GAS) and mosquito fish. We focused on the laboratory determination of lethal concentrations LC 50 and LC 100 through a static bioassay test. Separate experiments were performed for GAS and mosquito fish and ten experimental animals where stocked in each experimental unit. Based on a 24 -hour lethal concentration (LC 100), the toxicity for large GAS was 96. 21 ml/L for fresh fruits, 124. 02 ml/L <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> beans. <b>For</b> small GAS, the toxic concentrations were 91. 75 ml/L <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> beans, and 105. 89 ml/L for fresh fruits. For the 24 -h LC 50, the toxicity to large GAS of the two extracts were 47. 05 ml/L <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> beans, and 39. 28 ml/L for fresh fruits, and for small GAS they were 44. 87 ml/L <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> beans, and 51. 17 ml/L for fresh fruit. The lethal concentration LC 100 for mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis Baird and Gerard) was 2. 08 ml/L for fresh extract and 1. 71 ml/L <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> extract, while LC 50 on the 24 -hour basis was 0. 88 ml/L for fresh extract, and 0. 35 ml/L <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> extract...|$|R

40|$|The present author {{investigated}} the Physiological {{effects of the}} indigestible residues fraction of foods (lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) on the nutrition of children. First, the author estimated the amount of crude fiber in foods. Each fraction of the crude fiber was estimated by the methods of Williams, Olmsted and Somogyi. The results were summarized as follows. (1) The total amounts (per cent) of the crude fiber in each food were: 3. 48 for bean-flour, 3. 59 for polished rice, 4. 74 for white bread, 9. 44 for soybean flour, 10. 76 for wheat flour, 14. 82 for agar-agar flour, 22. 08 for bran, 32. 92 <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> potato and 46. 14 <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> carrot. (2) The amounts (per cent) of lignin in each food were: 1. 39 for bean flour, 1. 05 for polished rice, 0. 16 for white bread, 2. 0. for soy-bean flour, 3. 0. for wheat flour, 2. 0 for agar-agar flour, 3. 22 for bran, 2. 64 <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> potato and 9. 64 <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> carrot. (3) The amounts (percent) of cellulose in each food were 1. 18 for bean flour, 1. 21 for cleaned rice, 2. 16 for white bread, 4. 49 for soy-bean flour, 2. 94 for wheat flour, 5. 18 for agar-agar flour, 6. 35 for bran, 16. 2 <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> potato and 15. 3 <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> carrot. (4) The amount (percent) of hemicellulose in each food were 0. 91 for bean flour, 1. 33 for cleaned rice, 2. 42 for white bread, 2. 95 for soy-bean flour, 4. 82 for wheat flour, 7. 64 for agar-agar flour, 12. 51 for bran, 14. 08 <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> potato and 21. 21 <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> carrot.

5|$|Häkkinen {{began to}} pull away from Trulli. Although Button tried to pass Trulli on the fourth lap at the Bus Stop chicane, he ran wide and lost third {{position}} to Michael Schumacher. On that lap, Alesi was the first driver to pit <b>for</b> <b>dry</b> tyres. By the beginning of the fifth lap Häkkinen increased his lead over Trulli to ten seconds, ahead of Michael Schumacher, Button and Coulthard. Button attempted to overtake Trulli around the outside of the Bus Stop chicane, but left the inside open for Schumacher to pass him for third place. Schumacher then took second place from Trulli at La Source. Button attempted to follow Schumacher down the inside, but made contact with the latter. Trulli was sent into a spin, becoming the first retirement of the race. Button lost two positions to Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher in the incident. On the next lap Michael and Ralf Schumacher were the first leaders to pit <b>for</b> <b>dry</b> tyres, as Alesi began setting faster lap times than the front-runners. Häkkinen made a pit stop from the lead on lap seven, followed by Button, and re-emerged ahead of Coulthard to retain the lead. Coulthard made his pit stop on the following lap, re-emerging in ninth position.|$|E

5|$|Friskies is {{produced}} and marketed by Nestlé Purina Petcare, {{a subsidiary of}} Nestlé. Friskies was first introduced in the 1930s by Carnation through its subsidiary, Albers Company. By 1973, Friskies was one of five companies that controlled two-thirds of the $1.75 billion pet food market. At the time Carnation was known <b>for</b> <b>dry</b> milk products, but also had operations processing animal feed for farms. It experimented with dry food products for 3.5 years at Carnation Farms, initially with stray dogs in improvised cages, and later with pure-breds in a formal kennel. Carnation International was formed in 1966 to market Carnation's pet food products internationally in Japan, Spain, France, England and Italy, among others.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the US Congress {{directed}} the Department of Energy {{to report on}} ways to reduce water consumption by CSP. The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was available that, although more expensive to build and operate, could reduce water consumption by CSP by 91 to 95 percent, bringing their consumption below that of conventional power plants. A hybrid wet/dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by 32 to 58 percent. A 2015 report by NREL noted that of the 24 operating CSP power plants in the US, 17 used wet-cooling systems. The four existing CSP plants with dry-cooled systems were the three power plants at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility near Barstow, California, and the Genesis Solar Energy Project in Riverside County, California. Of 15 CSP projects under construction or development in the US as of March 2015, 6 planned to use wet systems (including one wet system using reclaimed wastewater), 7 planned <b>for</b> <b>dry</b> systems, 1 hybrid, and 1 unspecified.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two {{decades of the twentieth}} century the Indiana Anti-Saloon League (IASL), formed in 1898 as a state {{auxiliary}} of the national Anti-Saloon League, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union successfully organized pressure on Indiana politicians, especially members of the Republican party, to support the dry cause. The IASL, although not the first organization to take up the dry crusade in Indiana, became a key force behind efforts at attaining passage of statewide prohibition in early 1917, and rallied state support for ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1919. The IASL's success, under the leadership of Edward S. Shumaker, an ordained Methodist minister, made it a model for the League's other state organizations. Shumaker made clear to politicians he did not care whether they drank, but insisted they vote <b>for</b> <b>dry</b> laws or face defeated in the next election by dry voters.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{diversity}} within A. cepa occurs within this group, the most economically important Allium crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown <b>for</b> <b>dry</b> bulbs, salad onions, and pickling onions belong to this group. The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour. Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions, such as the Vidalia from Georgia, USA, or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.|$|E
5|$|The first {{studies for}} {{irrigation}} in the Plain {{were conducted by}} the United States Geological Survey in the late 19thcentury, and the project was authorized on April23, 1904. The first dam constructed for the project was Minidoka Dam in 1904; its power plant began operating in 1909, producing 7MW of electricity. This capacity was revised to 20MW in 1993. However, Minidoka Dam {{was not the only}} dam constructed for the project. As far upstream as Jackson Lake in Wyoming, the Jackson Lake Dam was built in 1907 to raise the lake level for providing additional water storage <b>for</b> <b>dry</b> years. American Falls Dam, upstream of Minidoka, was completed in 1927 and replaced in 1978. As the dams were constructed above Shoshone Falls, the historical upriver limit of salmon and also a total barrier to boats and ships, no provisions were made for fish passage or navigation. Several other irrigation dams were also built - including Twin Falls Dam and Palisades Dam.|$|E
