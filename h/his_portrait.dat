50|$|Armstrong first {{received}} critical {{attention for}} <b>his</b> intimate <b>portraits</b> of men, either lovers or friends, in sharp focus. In the nineties, {{he began to}} photograph cityscapes and landscapes in soft focus to contrast with the resolution of <b>his</b> <b>portraits.</b> Street lights, electric signs and cars are reduced to a sensual mottled blur, complementing the vividness and tactility of <b>his</b> <b>portraits.</b>|$|R

5|$|By {{the seventeenth}} century the fashion for {{portraiture}} had spread down the social order to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston. Adam de Colone, perhaps the son of Adrian Vanson and probably trained in the Netherlands, was working in England in the 1620s. In 1623 he painted <b>his</b> <b>portrait</b> of George Seaton, 3rd Earl of Winton and his sons and another of Seaton's wife Anne Hay with her two daughters.|$|E
5|$|In 1727 Adam and Sir John Clerk {{travelled}} to London, {{visiting a}} number of country seats along the way, including Cliveden, Wilton, and Wanstead House.

Also while in London, he sat to William Aikman for <b>his</b> <b>portrait.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1861, <b>his</b> <b>portraits</b> {{of friends}} and {{relatives}} of Frances, Lady Waldegrave were exhibited by Ernest Gambart at his Gallery in Pall Mall.

5|$|Pope Paul III and His Grandsons {{ranks as}} one of Titian's finest and most {{penetrating}} works. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than <b>his</b> <b>Portrait</b> of Pope Paul III of a few years earlier, it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of the tablecloth and the almost spectral whites of Paul's gown. The panel contains subtle indications of the contradictions in the character of the Pope, and captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men.|$|E
5|$|Wulfred was {{the first}} {{archbishop}} to place <b>his</b> <b>portrait</b> on the pennies struck in his name which, unlike those of previous archbishops, never made reference to the ruling Mercian king. Wulfred also rebuilt some buildings at Christ Church, Canterbury, {{although it is not}} known whether these were support buildings, such as the dormitory and refractory, or if he rebuilt the cathedral itself.|$|E
50|$|Many of <b>his</b> <b>portraits</b> {{received}} a wider circulation as engravings.|$|R
50|$|Swinton {{exhibited}} for {{the first}} time at the Royal Academy in 1844, and <b>his</b> <b>portraits</b> were familiar objects there for thirty years. Swinton was dependent on the vagaries of fashion for his vogue as a portrait-painter, and <b>his</b> <b>portraits</b> quickly lost their repute, although they will always retain their value as historical memorials.|$|R
50|$|From 1837 to 1848, Cooper {{averaged}} thirty-five <b>portraits</b> a year. <b>His</b> <b>portraits</b> of Tennessee governors, {{commissioned by}} the Tennessee Historical Society, {{can be seen in}} the Tennessee State Capitol and the Tennessee State Museum in Nashville. He also did portraits for the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Tennessee, and a portrait of Alexander Campbell. The Tennessee State Museum holds fifty of <b>his</b> <b>portraits.</b> <b>His</b> account book can be found on microfilm in the Tennessee State Library and Archives. Some of <b>his</b> <b>portraits</b> are in Natchez, Mississippi, where he made a trip with his brother.|$|R
5|$|Chabas first {{exhibited}} September Morn in the Paris Salon of April 14 to June 30, 1912. Because he did {{not plan}} to sell it, he gave a price of 50,000 francs ($10,000)– more than he expected anybody to pay. For the painting, and <b>his</b> <b>Portrait</b> of Mme. Aston Knight, Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 220 of 359 possible votes. At the Salon, the painting was uncontroversial, and it was soon reprinted in American publications such as Town & Country and The International Studio.|$|E
5|$|For {{the rest}} of the war, Leopold was held under house-arrest in the Palace of Laeken. In 1941, while still incarcerated, he married Mary Lilian Baels, {{undermining}} his popularity with the Belgian public which disliked Baels and considered the marriage to discredit his claim to martyr status. Despite his position, he remained prominent in the occupied territory, and coins and stamps continued to carry <b>his</b> <b>portrait</b> or monogramme. While imprisoned, he sent a letter to Hitler in 1942 credited with saving an estimated 500,000 Belgian women and children from forced deportation to munitions factories in Germany. In January 1944, Leopold was moved to Germany where he remained for {{the rest of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|From 1933 the Knights became regular {{visitors}} to Malvern, Worcestershire, making an annual {{visit to the}} Malvern Festival, which had been established by their friend Barry Jackson. During one such visit Knight met George Bernard Shaw and painted <b>his</b> <b>portrait.</b> A blue plaque at the Mount Pleasant Hotel on Belle Vue Terrace, Great Malvern, commemorates the time the Knights spent in the area. They found much inspiration for their work in the Malvern Hills and in the surrounding countryside and {{by the start of}} World War Two the couple were living at Colwall in Herefordshire.|$|E

5|$|In 1667 Mylne was {{in discussions}} with the town of Perth for {{construction}} of a new market cross. However, he died at Edinburgh in December. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh, where a monument, erected by his nephew and apprentice Robert Mylne, still stands. Another memorial was erected by the Freemasons at their meeting place, St. Mary's Chapel, although this former church was demolished in the 18th century. <b>His</b> <b>portrait</b> hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Robert Mylne succeeded him as master mason to the crown.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 Christiaan Schuckman {{discovered}} {{a set of}} signed plates in Madrid that {{can be attributed to}} the engraver of the First Folio portrait. These plates bear Droeshout's signature and are stylistically similar to <b>his</b> <b>portrait</b> of Shakespeare. (They include a portrait of the priest and writer Franciso de la Peña that has a striking resemblance to the English poet). On the evidence of these plates, which were made between 1635 and 1639, Schuckman attributed the portrait of Shakespeare to the younger Martin and suggested that the engraver had converted to Catholicism and emigrated to Spain in 1635, where he continued to work.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy, {{then the}} U.S. President, gave the {{graduation}} commencement address at Aztec Bowl {{in front of}} 40,000 people on June 6, 1963. Kennedy was given an honorary doctorate degree in law at the ceremony, making San Diego State the first in California to award an honorary doctorate degree. To commemorate his visit, the campus added <b>his</b> <b>portrait</b> to the campus library collection and a granite stone marker placed where his helicopter landed (California Historical Landmark #798). In April 2008, a plaque that commemorated his visit was stolen {{and has yet to}} be recovered.
