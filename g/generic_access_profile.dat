50|$|Typical {{abilities}} {{of a domestic}} DECT <b>Generic</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Profile</b> (GAP) system include multiple handsets to one base station and one phone line socket. This allows several cordless telephones to be placed around the house, all operating from the same telephone jack. Additional handsets have a battery charger station that does not plug into the telephone system. Handsets can in many cases be used as intercoms, communicating between each other, and sometimes as walkie-talkies, intercommunicating without telephone line connection.|$|E
50|$|Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{standards}} for cordless telephones. It uses 1.88 to 1.90 GHz RF (European Version) or 1.92 to 1.93 GHz RF (US Version). Different countries have regulations for the bandwidth used in DECT, but most have pre-set this band for wireless audio transmission. The most common profile of DECT is <b>Generic</b> <b>access</b> <b>profile</b> (GAP), which is used to ensure common communication between base station and its cordless handset. This common platform allows communication between the two devices even if they are from different manufacturers. For example, a Panasonic DECT base-station theoretically can connect to a Siemens DECT Handset. Based on this profile, developers such as Plantronics, Jabra or Accutone have launched wireless headsets which can directly pair with any GAP-enabled DECT telephones. So users with a DECT Wireless Headset can pair it with their home DECT phones and enjoy wireless communication.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The <b>Generic</b> <b>Access</b> Network (GAN) {{developed}} by 3 GPP extends services to unlicensed spectrum. A mobile station (MS) with multiple air interfaces can access 3 GPP services through GAN and roam seamlessly between different radio access networks. However, mobility management and resource man-agement are critical issues in GAN. To allocate GAN resources efficiently, we propose Adaptive Keep-alive Interval (AKI). By using AKI, an MS can send less signaling messages. In addition, AKI can increase system utilization by releasing unused resources. In this paper, we develop {{a mathematical model}} to evaluate the handoff failure probability of the proposed AKI. The analysis is validated by extensive simulations. The {{results show that the}} proposed AKI can reduce handoff failure probability and increase GAN utilization significantly.

50|$|Most major {{backers of}} LTE {{preferred}} and promoted VoLTE from the beginning. The lack of software support in initial LTE devices {{as well as}} core network devices however led {{to a number of}} carriers promoting VoLGA (Voice over LTE <b>Generic</b> <b>Access)</b> as an interim solution. The idea was to use the same principles as GAN (<b>Generic</b> <b>Access</b> Network, also known as UMA or Unlicensed Mobile Access), which defines the protocols through which a mobile handset can perform voice calls over a customer's private Internet connection, usually over wireless LAN. VoLGA however never gained much support, because VoLTE (IMS) promises much more flexible services, albeit at the cost of having to upgrade the entire voice call infrastructure. VoLTE will also require Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC) {{in order to be able}} to smoothly perform a handover to a 3G network in case of poor LTE signal quality.|$|R
