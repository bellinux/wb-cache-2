25|$|Although {{it is not}} yet well understood, IgE {{may play}} an {{important}} role in the immune system’s recognition of cancer, in which the stimulation of a strong cytotoxic response against cells displaying only small amounts of <b>early</b> <b>cancer</b> markers would be beneficial. If this were the case, anti-IgE treatments such as omalizumab (for allergies) might have some undesirable side effects. However, a recent study, which was performed based on pooled analysis using comprehensive data from 67 phase I to IV clinical trials of omalizumab in various indications, concluded that a causal relationship between omalizumab therapy and malignancy is unlikely.|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between Helicobacter pylori, intestinal metaplasia, and <b>early</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> was studied by examining gastrectomy specimens from 31 intestinal type and 22 diffuse type carcinomas. A total of 298 patients with antral gastritis {{were used as}} controls. Atrophic changes and intestinal metaplasia were significantly more common in intestinal type <b>early</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> compared with diffuse type <b>early</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> (p < 0. 05 and p < 0. 001, respectively). H pylori was found in 61. 3 % of intestinal type <b>early</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> and in 54. 5 % of diffuse type <b>early</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> (NS). The age adjusted prevalence of intestinal metaplasia in the patients with antral gastritis was higher in H pylori positive patients in all age groups studied. Comparing gastritis patients with patients with intestinal type <b>early</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> showed the age adjusted prevalence of intestinal metaplasia to be significantly higher in the patients with <b>early</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> in all age groups studied. In conclusion, H pylori is associated with both types of early gastric carcinoma. Intestinal metaplasia formation {{seems to be a}} multifactorial process in which H pylori may play a part.

40|$|The review {{presents}} the clinical and morphological characteristics of <b>early</b> gastric <b>cancer.</b> According {{to the most}} recent concepts, <b>early</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> is considered as endoscopically resectable cancer with good prognosis. Currently, <b>early</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> is defined as non-invasive high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (severe dysplasia) and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with intramucosal (T 1 a) and/or minor submucosal (T 1 b 1) invasion as well as poorly cohesive carcinoma, including signet-ring cell carcinoma, confined to the gastric mucosa (≤ 3 cm) without ulceration. Most authors consider that <b>early</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> should be characterized by the absence of regional lymph nodes (N 0) and distant metastasis (M 0). <b>Early</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> should be classified according to the macroscopic criteria proposed by the Japanese Society of Gastroenterological Endoscopy or the revised version of the Paris classification of superficial neoplastic lesions in the digestive tract as well as according to the World Health Organization classification and the recommendations of the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association. It is important to evaluate lymphovascular invasion in all <b>early</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> cases because of high risk of local metastases. Moreover, cases with mixed-type <b>early</b> gastric <b>cancer</b> (differentiated and undifferentiated components) need to be carefully examined, as they are high-metastatic potential lesions. The review considers predictive criteria for assessing the risk of regional metastasis in <b>early</b> gastric <b>cancer.</b> Cases of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer caused by CDHI gene mutations have been also analyzed. A literature review have allowed us to give recommendations on the risk stratification and the choice of an adequate treatment in patients with early gastric cance...|$|R

The value of ovarian ablation in prolonging {{the survival of}} premenopausal patients with <b>early</b> breast <b>cancer</b> was clearly established by the analyses performed by the <b>Early</b> Breast <b>Cancer</b> Trialists' Collaborative Group in 1996. More recently, the value of ovarian suppression using the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue goserelin as adjuvant therapy in pre-/perimenopausal women with <b>early</b> breast <b>cancer</b> has been confirmed {{in a series of}} studies involving over 8000 patients. The results from these studies provide evidence that goserelin, alone or in combination with tamoxifen, is at least as effective as cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive tumours and is effective when used after adjuvant chemotherapy. The use of goserelin in the management of <b>early</b> breast <b>cancer</b> presents an option which can avoid the side-effects experienced with cytotoxic chemotherapy and may offer unique benefits to premenopausal patients.
