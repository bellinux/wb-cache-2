He was also granted an imperial sword (尚方寶劍) from the previous emperor; whenever it was exhibited the persons surrounding, irrespective of their social classes, must pay respect and compliance to the person exhibiting as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> emperor. All guillotines of Bao Zheng were authorised to execute any persons without first obtaining approval from the emperor, whilst some accounts stating the imperial sword was a license to execute any royals before so reporting.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{few hours}} of Philip {{ascending}} to the throne, Lerma had been made a royal counsellor by the new king and set about establishing himself as a fully fledged valido, or royal favourite. Lerma, in due course declared a duke, positioned himself as the gateway to the king. All the business of government, Philip instructed, was to arrive in writing and be channeled through Lerma before reaching him. Whilst Philip was not hugely active in government in other ways, once these memoranda, or consulta, had reached him he appears to have been assiduous in commenting on them. Debates in royal councils would now only begin upon the written instruction of the king – again, through Lerma. All members of royal councils were under orders to maintain complete transparency with Lerma as the king's personal representative; indeed, in 1612 the councils were ordered by Philip to obey Lerma as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> king. The degree to which Lerma himself played an active role in government has been disputed. Contemporaries were inclined to see Lerma's hand in every action of government; others have since thought Lerma to have 'neither the temperament nor the energy' to impose himself greatly on the actions of government; still others consider Lerma to have carefully attended only those Councils of State that addressed matters of great importance to the king, creating a space for the wider professionalisation of government that had been lacking under Philip II.|$|E

Both {{of them wanted}} to bring their unique style to the project, and composed music for the title track. Eventually, Madonna felt that the music presented to her by Leonard was more interesting, and she started to work with him. Once Madonna had conceptualized the way she would interpose her ideas with the music, she wrote [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] in about three hours. Writing and producing it with Leonard, it became the first song developed for the album.

500|$|Henry's {{next steps}} {{are not well}} documented; one chronicler, Orderic Vitalis, {{suggests}} that he travelled in the French Vexin, along the Normandy border, {{for over a year}} with a small band of followers. By the end of the year, Robert and William Rufus had fallen out once again, and the Treaty of Rouen had been abandoned. In 1092, Henry and his followers seized the Normandy town of Domfront. Domfront had previously been controlled by Robert of Bellême, but the inhabitants disliked his rule and invited Henry to take over the town, which he did in a bloodless coup. Over the next two years, Henry re-established his network of supporters across western Normandy, forming what Judith Green terms a [...] "court in waiting". By 1094, he was allocating lands and castles to his followers as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Normandy. William Rufus began to support Henry with money, encouraging his campaign against Robert, and Henry used some of this to construct a substantial castle at Domfront.|$|E

500|$|The topic {{came up in}} a 2013 {{interview}} of President Barack Obama, who stated that if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> owner of the Redskins, he would consider changing the name because it offends many Native Americans, but {{that he did not}} have a stake in the issue as he is not an owner of a professional sports team. In November 2015 Obama, speaking at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, stated [...] "Names and mascots of sports teams like the Washington Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native Americans" [...] and praised Adidas for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of the cost of new uniforms. On May 22, 2014, fifty U.S. Senators, forty-eight Democrats and two Independents, sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Goodell asking the league, referencing the Donald Sterling case, to [...] "send the same clear message as the NBA did: that racism and bigotry have no place in professional sports." [...] Five Democratic Senators declined to sign the letter, and Republicans were not invited to do so. [...] No Senators have publicly supported the name, but rather have either declined to give an opinion or stated their opposition to Senate involvement in the issue.

500|$|The [...] "Dual Spires enhanced" [...] video at the Psych website lists further {{references}} to Twin Peaks. Shawn's name for Gus in this episode is [...] "Lodge Blackmunn", a direct {{reference to the}} Black and White Lodge. Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward says the same thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking at him as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt Your Way to a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls around in his living room. When Randy is using the table saw it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the body bag it is bent {{in such a way that}} it resembles a smile, like the smiling bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape like the kind used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match and holds it up like Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E
