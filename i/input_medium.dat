Sonic {{interaction design}} is at the intersection of interaction design and sound and music computing. If {{interaction design is}} about designing objects people interact with, and such interactions are facilitated by computational means, in sonic interaction design, sound is mediating interaction either as a display of processes or as an <b>input</b> <b>medium.</b>|$|E

The movement of a user's eyes can provide a convenient, natural, and high-bandwidth source of additional user input, to help redress this imbalance. We therefore investigate the introduction of eye movements as a computer <b>input</b> <b>medium.</b> Our {{emphasis is on the}} study of interaction techniques that incorporate eye movements into the user-computer dialogue in a convenient and natural way. This chapter describes research at NRL on developing such interaction techniques and the broader issues raised by non-command-based interaction styles.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{obstacles}} in building versatile natural humancomputer interaction systems is that the recognition of natural speech is still not sufficiently robust, especially in mobile situations where it's almost impossible to cancel out all irrelevant auditory information. In multimodal systems the possibility to disambiguate between several input and output modalities can substantially increase the intelligibility of dialogues and the robustness of interaction. The combination of natural speech and tactile gestures as <b>input</b> <b>mediums,</b> especially in mapbased systems, have shown prominent results, although mature commercial applications are still to be developed. In this paper we present the MUMS Multimodal Route Navigation System, intended for public transportation commuting. The system allows users to present route queries with any preferred combination of speech and pen input, and the system provides navigational information via speech and graphical map representations. The focus of this document is on the system's natural interaction model, which is designed keeping in mind the current limitations in natural speech recognition...|$|R

40|$|Combining {{mediated}} social touch (i. e., interpersonal touch over {{a distance}} {{by means of}} a tactile display) with vision allows people to both see and feel their remote interaction partner’s touches. This is expected to increase the user’s sense of telepresence (i. e., the experience of 2 ̆ 2 being there 2 ̆ 2 in the same environment as one’s remote interaction partner), thereby perhaps providing part of the imediacy that marks natural unmediated physical contact. Such a possible effect of combining touch with vision is expected to depend partly on the central nervous system’s ability to categorize tools and technological artifacts as an actual part of one’s body. Since such so-called self-attribution is facilitated by a morphological congruence between the artifact and the human body, we anticipated that the effect of combining touch with vision would be larger when people could see the mediated touches being performed on a morphologically congruent as compared to an incongruent <b>input</b> <b>medium.</b> In our experiment, we compared two input media: a sensor-equipped mannequin that enabled a one-to-one mapping between seen and felt touch, and a morphologically incongruent touch screen that displayed a set of buttons. When participants saw the touches being initiated on the morphologically congruent mannequin <b>input</b> <b>medium,</b> they, as expected, reported a higher sense of telepresence. In addition, they perceived of the mediated touches as more touchlike with the mannequin as compared to the touch screen <b>input</b> <b>medium.</b> These findings illustrate that visual feedback, especially when morphologically correct, can improve mediated social touch. Our experiment, however, suggests that other mechanisms than self-attribution might be involved...|$|E

40|$|The {{vertical}} {{organization of}} production entails {{a range of}} make-or-buy decisions of intermediate goods that {{are influenced by the}} difficulty of writing contracts with a potential supplier. When contracting causes high transaction costs, a firm can decide to vertically integrate the production of the intermediate product. Contract complexity can be measured by decomposing the range of inputs into inputs that are traded on an exchange (low contract complexity), inputs for which reference prices exist (low to medium contract complexity) and other, often relationship-specific <b>inputs</b> (<b>medium</b> to high contract complexity). This inaugural lecture addresses the impact of contract complexity on the growth opportunities of a firm. The present value of growth opportunities are embedded in the market value of a firm, which is a multiple of the firm’ stock price. Examining the relation between the growth opportunities as part of the market value and contract complexity, we find that contract complexity has a negative impact on the growth opportunities of a firm if vertical integration is difficult. Whereas, on average, growth opportunities account for 56 % of the market value of a firm, this percentage ranges between 50 % and 53 % for firms in sectors where contracts are complex and vertical integration is difficult. The difference represents a current market value between € 12 bn. and € 24 bn. only taking into account Dutch listed firms...|$|R
