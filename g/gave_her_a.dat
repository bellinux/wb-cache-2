5|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{working on the}} project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her {{white blood cell count}} halved. The doctors <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E

5|$|The Emperor assured Mary {{that he had}} {{no doubts}} about her loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church. He had learned that the Queen could not easily be bullied, {{especially}} not in matters which affected her personally. Yet, upon leaving the States General in October 1531, Charles <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> warning, saying that if his parent, wife, child or sibling became a follower of Luther, he would consider them his greatest enemy. Mary was thus forced to suppress Protestantism in the Netherlands, regardless of her own religious tolerance. However, she always strived to enforce her brother's laws on religion as little as possible. She was accused of protecting Protestants on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|The Queen, {{pregnant}} again, {{was aware}} of the dangers if she failed to give birth to a son. With Catherine dead, Henry would be free to marry without any taint of illegality.

Anne responded by ripping off the locket with such force her fingers bled.|$|E

The Sun and its mother <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> walnut and send her on to the Stars. One star has seen him, and the Stars and their mother <b>give</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> hazelnut.
