In this paper, {{we present a}} method for partial face extraction and recognition based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks. Focus has been centered on using ear images {{because they are not}} influenced by facial expression, and the influences of aging are negligible. Original human side face image with 320 x 240 pixels is input, and then the RBF network locates the ear and extracts it with a 200 x 120 pixels image. Next, another RBF network is constructed for the purpose of recognition.

This paper presents a robust lip tracking algorithm using localized color active contours and deformable models. The proposed approach utilizes a combined semiellipse as the initial evolving curve and computes the localized energies in color space for evolving such that a separation of the original lip image into lip and non-lip regions can be found. Moreover, the <b>dynamic</b> <b>radius</b> selection of the local region is presented with a 16 -point deformable model (Wang et al. 2004) to achieve the lip tracking. The proposed approach is adaptive to the movement of the lips from frame to frame, and robust against the appearance of the teeth and tongue. Experiments have shown the promising results.

40|$|According to {{previous}} research of dynamic end milling models, the instantaneous <b>dynamic</b> <b>radii</b> on every cutting position affects the cutting forces directly since the simulated forces are {{proportional to the}} chip thickness, and the chip thickness {{is a function of}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>radii</b> and feedrate. With the concept of flute engagement introduced, it is important to discuss it with respect to radial and axial depths of cut because the length of the engaged flutes is affected by factors in the axial feed and rotational directions. Radial and axial depths of cut affect the “contact area”, which is the area that a cutter contacts with the workpiece. When radial and axial depths of cut increase, the cutting forces also increase since the engaged flute lengths are increased. Therefore, {{in order to have a}} clearer idea of the milling forces, the influences of <b>dynamic</b> <b>radii,</b> cutting feedrate, and radial and axial depths of cut are discussed in this paper.

The total energy consumption may be minimized by properly scheduling com-munications in conjunction with aggregating data and dynami-cally adjusting radii. We propose near-optimal data aggregation routing and duty cycle scheduling heuristics, denoted by MDAR and O-MAC, which achieve energy efficiency and bound latency within a reasonable range. These heuristics outperform other general data aggregation routing heuristics (e. g., CNS, GIT, and SPT) and scheduling protocols (e. g., S-MAC and T-MAC) by 7 %- 45 %, according to our experimental results.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research of tires {{was to determine the}} <b>dynamic</b> rolling <b>radius</b> and to apply it to wheel slip calculations with special respect to vertical wheel load and to tire inflation pressure. It is typical of mechanical four-wheel drive tractors that there is a definite additional power in the tractor power chain. This additional power is dependent on the difference between the front wheel and rear wheel peripheral speeds. Further-more, the purpose was to determine the effect of additional slip on four-wheel drive tractors operated without drawbar pull. Experiments were performed on asphalt surfaces and fields. A new measurement method was developed, and a device was constructed for the implementation of three tractor wheel drive operational modes (four-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive and front-wheel drive). As the result of the experiments, a relationship was found to describe the <b>dynamic</b> rolling <b>radius</b> for low-profile radial tires tested on rigid road surfaces. On this basis, the classical slip calculation method was modified. This phenomenon appears only on hard roads and soil surfaces with high adhesion coefficients and only within the low drawbar pull range...|$|R
40|$|Two meddies were {{identified}} in the Iberian Basin using shipboard ADCP (Meddy 1) and ARGO float (Meddy 2) in contrasting background conditions. Meddy 1 was observed while interacting with the Azores current (AzC) while Meddy 2 was observed rather far north from the AzC jet, in much calmer dynamical background. In both cases the meddies produced a clear anticyclonic surface signal, detectable in altimetry {{as well as in}} sea-surface temperature (SST). Analysis of the in-situ observations of the dynamic signal over Meddy 1 showed that the signal, generated by the moving meddy, dominated the AzC dynamics at least up {{to the base of the}} seasonal thermocline even at the late stages of its interaction with the jet. The center of rotation of the surface signal was shifted south-westward from the axis of the meddy by about 18 km, and its <b>dynamic</b> <b>radius</b> was 2 times bigger than that of the meddy. The SST anomalies in the core of the surface signals were negative in contrast to the positive SST anomalies in surface anticyclones generated by meandering surface currents. The later difference gives ground for identification of meddies (as well as other sub-surface anticyclones) using coupled altimetry – SST remote sensing data. An identification of Meddy 1 previous to the shipboard ADCP measurements was the first successful experience. At the same time, SST anomalies over both meddies were rather weak, often unstable and statistically significant only over periods of months...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this work, we obtain new {{results on}} the manifestation of meddies (or of other deep eddies) at the sea-surface, further {{developing}} the results by Bashmachnikov and Carton (2012). The quasi-geostrophic equations are used to describe a near-axisymmetric vortex in the upper ocean, forced at its lower boundary by the isopycnal elevation of a moving meddy. The solution thus obtained provides a better approximation {{of the characteristics of}} meddy surface signals. The results show that in subtropics large meddies with <b>dynamic</b> <b>radius</b> inline image[*]≥[*] 30 km are always seen at the sea-surface with AVISO altimetry, that medium-size meddies with inline image[*]=[*] 20 km may be seen at the sea-surface only if they are sufficiently shallow and strong, while small meddies with inline image[*]=[*] 10 km generally cannot be detected with the present accuracy of altimetry data. The intensity of meddy surface signals decreases to the south with the decrease of the inline image ratio. The seasonal variation in intensity of the surface signal for northern meddies (45 °N) is on the order of 2 – 3 cm, but for subtropical meddies (35 °N) it can be on the order of 5 – 10 cm. The radii of meddy surface signals range from 1 to 2 times the radii of the corresponding meddies. For most of the observed subtropical meddies, the upper limit should be used. Numerical experiments show that surface signals of meddies translated with inline image-drift are efficiently dispersed by the radiation of Rossby waves. At the same time, for meddies translated by a background current, the surface signal does not show strong dissipation...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{multimodal}} functional optimization has been addressed by much research producing many different search techniques. Niche Genetic Algorithms {{is one area}} that has attempted to solve this problem. Many Niche Genetic Algorithms use some type of radius. When multiple optima occur within the radius, these algorithms {{have a difficult time}} locating them. Problems that have arbitrarily close optima create a greater problem. This paper presents a new Niche Genetic Algorithm framework called Dynamic-radius Species-conserving Genetic Algorithm. This new framework extends existing Genetic Algorithm research. This new framework enhances an existing Niche Genetic Algorithm in two ways. As the name implies the radius of the algorithm varies during execution. A uniform radius can cause issues if it is not set correctly during initialization. A <b>dynamic</b> <b>radius</b> compensates for these issues. The framework does not attempt to locate all of the optima in a single pass. It attempts to find some optima and then uses a tabu list to exclude those areas of the domain for future iterations. To exclude these previously located optima, the framework uses a fitness sharing approach and a seed exclusion approach. This new framework addresses many areas of difficulty in current multimodal functional optimization research. This research used the experimental research methodology. A series of classic benchmark functional optimization problems were used to compare this framework to other algorithms. These other algorithms represented classic and current Niche Genetic Algorithms. Results from this research show that this new framework does very well in locating optima in a variety of benchmark functions. In functions that have arbitrarily close optima, the framework outperforms other algorithms. Compared to other Niche Genetic Algorithms the framework does equally well in locating optima that are not arbitrarily close. Results indicate that varying the radius during execution and the use of a tabu list assists in solving functional optimization problems for continuous functions that have arbitrarily close optima...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{wide range}} of {{evidence}} to suggest that permeability can be constrained through of induced polarization measurements. For clean sands and sandstones, current mechanistic models of induced polarization predict a relationship between the low-frequency time constant inferred from induced polarization measurements and the grain diameter. A number of observations do, however, disagree with this and indicate that the observed relaxation behavior is rather governed by the so-called <b>dynamic</b> pore <b>radius</b> L. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a set of new scaling relationships, which allow the relaxation time to be computed from the pore size and the permeability to be computed from both the Cole-Cole time constant and the formation factor. Moreover, these new scaling relationships can be also used to predict the dependence of the Cole-Cole time constant {{as a function of the}} water saturation under unsaturated conditions. Comparative tests of the proposed new relationships with regard to various published experimental results for saturated clean sands and sandstones as well as for partially saturated clean sandstones, do indeed confirm that the <b>dynamic</b> pore <b>radius</b> L is a much more reliable indicator of the observed relaxation behavior than grain-size-based models...|$|R

The heat sources were assembled from four rectangular units 1. 5 m in length and 0. 25 m in width. Four different configurations with aspect ratios between 1. 5 and 6 were tested. Surface temperatures were chosen to maintain approximately the same convected power from the sources, for all the situations. A battery of sixteen anemometric probes and sixty four thermometric probes simultaneously recorded plume velocity and temperature distribution. These measurements allowed to determine the actual energy entrained by the plume above the source. Velocity measurements also allowed the plume flow rate to be evaluated. The evolution of ΔTc, the temperature difference between the maximum temperature and the ambient temperature for a given horizontal plane, yielded an approximation of the virtual origin that is in close agreement with the plume thermal and <b>dynamic</b> <b>radii</b> above the source.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{application of}} a hydrogel-based strong anion-exchange (Q) membrane to purify plasmid DNAs was evaluated. The maximum binding capacity of plasmid DNA {{was estimated to be}} 12. 4 mg/ml of membrane volume with a plasmid DNA recovery of ~ 90 %, which is superior to other commercially available anion-exchange resins and membranes. The membrane was able to retain its structural integrity and performance after multiple cycles of usage (> 30 cycles). The inherent properties of plasmid DNA, membrane adsorbent, and the ionic environment on membrane performance were identified as the factors affecting membrane performance and their effects were systematically investigated. Plasmid DNAs with smaller tertiary structure have shorter <b>dynamic</b> <b>radius</b> and/or lowersurface charge densities, which tended to have a better adsorption and recovery than those with larger tertiary structure. Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) revealed that the hydrogel structure is more porous on one side of membrane than the other, and higher plasmid DNA adsorption and recovery capacities were observed if the more porous side of the membrane was installed upward of flow in the chromatographic unit. ESEM also revealed improved pore distribution and increased membrane porosity if membrane was pre-equilibrated in the buffer solution for 16 hours. The development of better flow through channel in the hydrogel membrane upon extensive soaking further improved plasmid DNA adsorption and recovery capacities. The ionic environment affects the tertiary size of plasmid DNA; and the optimal operating pH of membrane chromatography was different for the plasmid DNAs investigated in this study. The relative contribution of these factors to improve membrane chromatography of plasmid DNAs was analyzed using statistical modeling. It was found that the adsorption of plasmid DNA was mainly affected by the available adsorptive area associated with membrane porosity, whereas the recovery of plasmid DNAs was mainly affected by the environmental pH. A novel, RNase-free, and potentially scalable bioprocess was synthesized using the hydrogel membrane as the technology platform for the manufacturing of pharmaceutical-grade plasmid DNA. High bioprocess recovery and product quality were primarily associated with the optimal integration of impurity removal by calcium chloride precipitation and anion-exchange membrane chromatography and the implementation of isopropanol precipitation as a coupling step between the two impurity-removing steps. Complete removal of total cellular RNA impurity was demonstrated without the use of animal-derived RNase. High-molecular-weight (HMW) RNA and genomic DNA (gDNA) were removed by selective precipitation using calcium chloride at an optimal concentration. Complete removal of the remaining low-molecular-weight (LMW) RNA was achieved by membrane chromatography using the high-capacity and high-productive hydrogel membrane. The simultaneous achievement of desalting, concentrating and buffer exchange by the coupling step of isopropanol precipitation and the high efficiency and resolution of DNA-RNA separation by anion-exchange membrane chromatography significantly reduced the operating complexity of the overall bioprocess, increased the overall recovery of plasmid DNA, and enhanced product quality by removing trace amounts of impurities of major concern for biomedical applications, such as gDNA, proteins, and endotoxin...|$|E

An evolving Takagi-Sugeno (eTS) algorithm, {{which is based on}} a recursive version of the subtractive algorithm is considered. It groups data into several clusters based on Euclidean distance between the relevant independent variables. The Mod eTS algorithm, which incorporates a modified dynamic update of cluster radii while accommodating new available data is proposed. The created clusters serve as a base for fuzzy If-Then rules with Gaussian membership functions which are defined using the cluster centres and have linear functions in the consequent i. e., Then parts of rules. The parameters of the linear functions are calculated using a weighted version of the Recursive Least Squares algorithm. The proposed algorithm is applied to a leakage forecasting problem faced by one of the leading UK water supplying companies.

Different measures of forecasting accuracy are used. The results show higher accuracy achieved by applying the algorithm proposed compared to other fuzzy clustering algorithms and statistical methods.

High depth resolution {{is achieved by}} scanning the energy per nucleus of the incoming molecules E-b around the energy E-R corresponding to narrow resonances in the cross sections of O- 18 (p, alpha) N- 15 at 151 keV and in N- 15 (p, alpha gamma) C- 12 at 429 keV. The corresponding reaction yield Y (E-b) is, to first order, inversely proportional to the stopping force S-mol on the molecular fragments, giving a direct image {{of the evolution of}} the vicinage effect and Coulomb explosion with z. At the target surface, the vicinage effect enhances the stopping force on the molecules by a factor chi > 1. As they penetrate the matter, the distance between the molecule nuclei increases, as a consequence of Coulomb explosion and multiple scattering lateral displacement, and the vicinage effect decreases with depth z. The experiment yields information on the screened Coulomb repulsive potential via the repulsion velocity V-lim observed at large z, where the distances R-ij between the molecule nuclei are large compared to the adiabatic cutoff R-ad (no vicinage effect). We show that the first order view, that Y (Eb) proportional to S-mol(- 1), is profoundly modified by the energy fluctuations induced by the Coulomb explosion and lateral multiple scattering.

We find that the maximal radial blob velocity increases with the square root of the initial pressure perturbation and that a finite Larmor radius contributes to highly compact blob structures that propagate in the poloidal direction. An extensive parameter study reveals that a smooth transition to this compact blob regime occurs when the finite Larmor radius effect strength, defined by the ratio of the magnetic field aligned component of the ion diamagnetic to the E⃗×B⃗ vorticity, exceeds unity. The maximal radial blob velocities agree excellently with the inertial velocity scaling law over more than an order of magnitude. We show that the finite Larmor radius effect strength affects the poloidal and total particle transport and present an empirical scaling law for the poloidal and total blob velocities.

Although there is a general consensus regarding the risk factors for distal radius fractures resulting from forward falling, prevention of these injuries requires a more thorough understanding of the injury mechanisms. Therefore the overall purpose of this dissertation was to assess the response of the upper extremity to impact loading to improve the understanding of distal radius fracture mechanisms and the effectiveness of joint kinematic strategies for reducing the impact effects. Three main studies were conducted that utilized in vivo, in vitro and numerical techniques. In vitro impact testing of the distal radius revealed that fracture will occur at a mean (SD) resultant impact force and velocity of 2142. 1 (1228. 7) N and 3. 4 (0. 7) m/s, respectively.

The molecules hydrodynamic <b>radius</b> (<b>Dynamic</b> Light Scattering), light absorbance (UV-Vis), electrophoretic mobility, relative density, dynamic viscosity, absorption (Quartz Crystal Microbalance) and circular dichroism (CD) characteristics were studied. It was found that lysozyme forms small dimer/trimer aggregates upon the synthesis of AuNCs within the protein. The diameter of Ly-AuNCs was found to be 8. 0 nm across a pH range of 2 - 11 indicating dimer formation, but larger aggregates with diameters > 20 nm formed between pH 3 - 6. The formation of larger aggregates limits Ly-AuNCs use as a fluorescent probe in this pH range. A large shift in the protein’s isoelectric point was also observed, shifting from 11. 0 to 4. 0 upon AuNC synthesis. This resulted in major changes to the adsorption characteristics of lysozyme, observed using QCM. A monolayer of 8 nm was seen for Ly-AuNCs at pH 4, offering further evidence the proteins form small aggregates, unlike the natural monomer form of lysozyme. The adsorption of Ly-AuNCs was seen to decrease as pH was increased; this is in major contrast with lysozyme absorption behaviour. A decrease in α-helix content was observed from 25 % in natural lysozyme to 1 % in Ly-AuNCs. This coincided with an increase in β-sheet content after AuNCs synthesis indicating that the natural structure of lysozyme was lost. The formation of protein dimers, the change in protein surface charge from positive to negative, and secondary structure alteration caused by the AuNC synthesis must be considered before attempting to utilise Ly-AuNCs as in vivo probes...|$|R
