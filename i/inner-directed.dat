50|$|Riesman et al. {{identify}} and analyze three main cultural types: tradition-directed, <b>inner-directed,</b> and other-directed. They trace {{the evolution of}} society from a tradition-directed culture, one that moved in a direction defined by preceding generations. Tradition-directed social types obeyed rules established {{a long time in}} the past and rarely succeeded in modern society, with its dynamic changes. This earliest social type was succeeded by people who were <b>inner-directed.</b> They discovered the potential within themselves to live and act not according to established norms but based on what they discovered using their own inner gyroscope. <b>Inner-directed</b> people live as adults what they learned in childhood, and tend to be confident, sometimes rigid. After the Industrial Revolution in America had succeeded in developing a middle-class state, institutions that had flourished within the tradition-directed and the <b>inner-directed</b> social framework became secondary to daily life. Instead of living according to traditions, or conforming to the values of organized religion, of the family, or societal codes, the new middle class gradually adopted a malleability in the way people lived with each other. The increasing ability to consume goods and afford material abundance was accompanied by a shift away from tradition or inner-directedness. How to define one's self became a function of the way others lived.|$|E

Riesman was a prominent member of the American academic left, influenced by Erich Fromm and the Frankfurt School. In reality, Riesman's book was an academic attempt to give credit to the concept of [...] "mass society" [...] and especially to the idea of an America suffocated in social conformity. Riesman had essentially argued that at the emerging of highly-advanced capitalism, the America basic value system and its socializing roles had change from an [...] "inner-directed" [...] toward an [...] "other-directed" [...] pattern of value-orientation. Parsons and White challenged Riesman's idea and argued that there had been no change away from an <b>inner-directed</b> personality structure.

What had happen, however, was that the industrialized process and its increased pattern of societal differentiation had changed the family's generalized symbolic function in society and had allowed for a greater permissiveness in the way the child related to his parents. Parsons and White argued that was not the prelude to greater [...] "otherdirectness" [...] but a more complicated way by which <b>inner-directed</b> pattern situated itself in the social environment.|$|E

5000|$|According {{to general}} strain theory, {{studies suggest that}} gender {{differences}} between individuals can lead to externalized anger that may result in violent outbursts. These violent actions related to gender inequality can be measured by comparing violent neighborhoods to non-violent neighborhoods. By noticing the independent variables (neighborhood violence) and the dependent variable (individual violence), it's possible to analyze gender roles. The strain in the general strain theory is the removal of a positive stimulus and or {{the introduction of a}} negative stimulus, which would create a negative effect (strain) within individual, which is either <b>inner-directed</b> (depression/guilt) or outer-directed (anger/frustration), which depends on whether the individual blames themselves or their environment. [...] Studies reveal that even though males and females are equally likely to react to a strain with anger, the origin of the anger and their means of coping with it can vary drastically. Males are likely to put the blame on others for adversity and therefore externalize feelings of anger. Females typically internalize their angers and tend to blame themselves instead. Female internalized anger is accompanied by feelings of guilt, fear, anxiety and depression. Women view anger as a sign that they've somehow lost control, and thus worry that this anger may lead them to harm others and/or damage relationships. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum, men are less concerned with damaging relationships and more focused on using anger as a means of affirming their masculinity. According to the general strain theory, men would more likely engage in aggressive behavior directed towards others due to externalized anger whereas women would direct their anger towards themselves rather than others.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{possible}} differences in value patterns of students residing in four types of university living environments [...] residence halls, Greek houses, cooperatives, and off campus dwellings. The Rokeach Value Survey was utilized as the major measurement tool for identification of the value patterns of students. Within each living group type, 125 males and 125 females were asked to respond to the questionnaire, creating a total random sample of 1, 000. The data were collected during Fall Term 1976, on the Oregon State University campus. The hypotheses considered seven major factors: immediate versus delayed gratification, competence versus religious morality, self-constriction versus self-expansion, social versus personal orientation, societal versus family security, respect versus love, and inner- versus other-directed. The analysis of variance technique with the F-ratio was used to identify significant differences between the value rankings of students in the four living groups. The level of significance was set at. 01 for all of the tests. Additional analyses of data included comparisons of value rankings of students grouped according to sex, academic major, level of participation in campus activities, political philosophy, hometown size, and geographic region. The major findings were as follows: 1) As a whole, students rated delayed gratification, self-expansion, personal orientation, family security, love, and <b>inner-directed</b> values higher than the opposite factor poles, respectively. 2) Students from Greek houses tended to place significantly less importance on the delayed gratification values when compared to the other groups. 3) Students who reside in off-campus environments tended to give higher priority to competence values, while members of the university sponsored living groups considered religious morality values more important. 4) When comparisons were made on self-expansion and self-constriction values, it was found that students from cooperatives, ranked expansion values significantly lower than did students from the other three living groups. 5) Students residing in Greek houses ranked family security values significantly higher than did students in the other groups when compared with societal values. 6) Students residing in cooperative and off-campus units tended to rate love values significantly higher than did Greek or residence hall students, when compared with respect values. 7) Students in residence halls tended to rate <b>inner-directed</b> values significantly lower than did members of the other groups, when compared with other-directed values, while off-campus residents ranked the <b>inner-directed</b> values significantly higher. 8) Comparisons between factors when students were grouped according to sex revealed that females tended to rate delayed gratification, religious morality, societal, and <b>inner-directed</b> values significantly higher than did males. 9) Students who classify themselves as liberals tended to rate societal, competence, and self-expansion values higher than did "middle-of-the-road" or conservative students when contrasted with family security, religious morality, or selfconstriction values, respectively. 10) Immediate gratification values were rated higher by students who identified themselves as active in campus events when compared with students who were classified as non-participants.

I. A 2 x 2 x 2 (eight cells) factorial analysis included length of attendance, vocational choice, and age, applied to each of the 12 POI scales. It was found that: (1) POI measures did not differentiate between persisters and drop-outs over a one semester period; (2) that liberal arts students received better POI scores than did technical vocational students on the scales of <b>Inner-Directed</b> Control, Existentiality, Self-Regard, Synergy, and Capacity for Intimate Contact; and (3) that older students received better scores than younger students on the Time Competence, <b>Inner-Directed</b> Control, Self-Actualizing Values, Synergy, and Self-Regard scales.

The intent was also to examine the relationship between self-concept and anxiety change in the two classifications. The research was planned to examine three hypotheses. A t test was administered for significance of difference in anxiety change between the inner- and other-directed classifications, and correlation coefficients were established in order to examine the relationship between anxiety and self-concept in the two classifications. The data used in this study were collected from the test results on the modified scale from the Personal Orientation Inventory (POI), the scores from the pretests and posttests of the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (TMAS), and the scores from the Tennessee Self Concept Scale (TSCS). The TMAS was administered to 28 participants in an unstructured workshop on creativity on the first day and again on the afternoon of the fourth day when the workshop was completed. The TSCS and the modified scale from the POI were administered on the second day. The 28 subjects included 8 men and 20 women employed by the Louisville Board of Education. Administrators, teachers, social workers, and paraprofessionals volunteered for this experience. They ranged in age from 18 to 55. Subjects scoring in the upper two quartiles on the modified inner- and other-directed POI scale were classified as inner-directed; whereas those scoring in the lower two quartiles were classifed as other-directed. Two pilot studies were conducted with this modified scale previous to its use on this study. Hypothesis # 1 was examined by comparing the means of the anxiety change scores which were taken from the TMAS pretests and posttests. A t test was administered for significance of difference between the two means of the TMAS pretest and posttests and was significant at the. 05 level of confidence. Hypotheses # 2 and # 3 were examined by using a correlation co-efficient on the anxiety change scores and the Total P scores from the T SCS. The r's were examined, but the relationship between anxiety change and the self-concept scores of this population were not significant in either classification. The self-concept of the <b>inner-directed,</b> however, was significantly higher than the self-concept of the other-directed.

The literature suggests that style of coping may influence amount of pain experienced, and that parents' beliefs may influence their child's choice of coping skills. Fifteen youth with JA and their primary caregivers participated in a semi-structured interview. Pain experience was measured with the Varni/Thompson Pediatric Pain Questionnaire, and an instrument to measure youth arthritis coping skills adapted from the Vanderbilt Pain Management Inventory was titled The Children's Arthritis Coping Inventory, which consisted of two sub-scales representing <b>inner-directed</b> and outer-directed coping. No relationship was found between youth reports of frequency of uses of inner and outer directed coping skills. There was a nonsignificant negative relationship between a child's use of outer-directed coping and reported pain (r = - 0. 33 ₁₄), and {{a positive relationship between}} <b>inner-directed</b> coping and pain (r = 0. 67 ₁₄, p <. 01). The use of proportionately more inner than outer directed coping was also significantly related to reported pain (r = 0. 66 ₁₄, p <. 01), while primary use of outer coping was not (r = - 0. 13 ₁₄). Parents did accurately estimate the magnitude of their child's experienced pain, and type of coping skill used. Hypotheses of parental beliefs influencing their child's coping skill use were not fully supported, as there were non-significant positive relationships between (a) parents estimates of the child's coping and (b) their opinion of what skills are best to use, with those their child did report (r = 0. 12 ₁₄, r = 0. 30 ₁₄ respectively).

In this novel, two protagonists, a woman and her stepson, alternate telling the story; one protagonist is inner-directed; the other is other-directed. And when the third member of the family suddenly dies, the two opposing identity types are forced {{to find some way to}} communicate, some way to connect as opposed to merely dancing around one another, dancing to death's song [...] the requiem's waltz...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 52 - 56) Two different psychologies, Jungian Analytical Psychology and Feeling Therapy {{have both}} claimed that transformation occurs in {{individuals who have}} experienced these modalities. This thesis served as a pilot study to attempt {{to determine whether there}} was a significant difference in scores for self-actualization, determined by results of Shostrum' s Personal Orientation Inventory, and if there was a difference in scores for dream awareness, expression and transformation, determined by the results of the Dream Capabilities Assessment Test. The Personal Orientation Inventory is standardized, therefore, the sample groups from Jungian Therapy, Feeling Therapy, a group from mixed modalities, and a control group were compared with the mean. The results indicated that all three therapy groups scores were significant at the. 01 level on the <b>Inner-Directed</b> scale. Since this study was quasi-experimental, it cannot be inferred that therapy caused this difference. The dream test was not standardized, therefore, this study could not show any significance for this test. It is notable that the scores for all three therapy groups were remarkably close...|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} was conducted to determine the accuracy of four models of gender differences in achievement orientation, {{and the extent to}} which the models are redundant. Bakan 2 ̆ 7 s (1966) model suggests that men strive for mastery and self-enhancement (agentic orientation), whereas women are interested in social goals (communal orientation). Stein and Bailey 2 ̆ 7 s (1973) model portrays women 2 ̆ 7 s achievement strivings as directed at the attainment of excellence in social-affiliative activities (social focus), whereas men strive for mastery of objective tasks (task focus). Kipnis 2 ̆ 7 (1974) model suggests that women feel successful to the extent that personal goals have been met (<b>inner-directed),</b> and that men evaluate their performance in relation to that of their peers (other-directed). Veroff 2 ̆ 7 s (1977) model predicts that women focus on how something was accomplished (process emphasis), whereas men are primarily interested in what was done (impact emphasis). Self-reports of success and failure experiences of female and male undergraduates were examined by trained raters. Scores derived from the content analyses revealed that males 2 ̆ 7 experiences showed greater impact orientation and less inner-direction than did those of females. No gender differences were found for agentic, communal, task, social, process, or other-directed foci in achievement. Thus, Kipnis 2 ̆ 7 and Veroff 2 ̆ 7 s models seem more accurate than Bakan 2 ̆ 7 s and Stein and Bailey 2 ̆ 7 s in predicting gender differences in achievement. Factor analyses revealed overlap among the eight dimensions based on the four models, since only two important achievement focus dimensions were found. Task and agentic vs. social and communal foci provided a domain dimension. A performance evaluation dimension was determined by impact and other-directed vs. <b>inner-directed</b> and process foci. Further analyses involved measures of subject 2 ̆ 7 s masculinity-feminity (Personal Attributes Questionnaire; Spence et al., 1974), achievement motivation (Work and Family Orientation Questionnaire; Helmreich 2 ̆ 6 Spence, 1978), and causal attributions. The results of this research indicate: (1) sex-role stereotypes are intimately related to the domains of important achievement activities; however, men and women do not differ in the kinds of activities (domains) that they report as successes or failures, and (2) women and men differ in how they define success and failure, but these performance evaluation styles are not related to sex-role stereotypes...|$|E
