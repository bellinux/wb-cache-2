It was here that the scouts of Anderlecht first spotted Mertens, {{ultimately}} resulting in him being offered a chance to join the club's youth academy in 1998.

5|$|Kahaanis first-look poster was {{launched}} on 2 December 2011, {{and the official}} trailer on 5 January 2012.

His father held shares in many ships, but he died when Rogers was in his mid-twenties, leaving Rogers {{in control of the}} family shipping business. In 1707, Rogers was approached by Captain William Dampier, who sought support for a privateering voyage against the Spanish, with whom the British were at war. Rogers led the expedition, which consisted of two well-armed ships, Duke and Duchess, and was the captain of Duke. In three years, Rogers and his men went around the world, capturing several ships in the Pacific Ocean. En route, the expedition rescued Selkirk, <b>finding</b> <b>him</b> on Juan Fernandez Island on 1 February 1709. When the expedition returned to England in October 1711, Rogers had circumnavigated the globe, while retaining his original ships and most of his men, and the investors in the expedition doubled their money.|$|E

5|$|The major {{characteristic}} of Prester John tales {{from this period}} is the king's portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. But as the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away from the idea that Prester John had ever really been a Central Asian king. At any rate they had little hope of <b>finding</b> <b>him</b> there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the Empire had provided. In works such as The Travels of Sir John Mandeville and Historia Trium Regum by John of Hildesheim, Prester John's domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and finds itself located not on the steppes of Central Asia, but back in India proper, or some other exotic locale. Wolfram von Eschenbach tied the history of Prester John to the Holy Grail legend in his poem Parzival, in which the Prester {{is the son of}} the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight Feirefiz.|$|E
5|$|The maximum fine that Landis could impose was $29,240,000. To aid {{the judge}} in {{determining}} the sentence, Landis issued a subpoena for Rockefeller to testify as to Standard Oil's assets.

Deputy United States marshals visited Rockefeller's several homes, {{as well as the}} estates of his friends, in the hope of <b>finding</b> <b>him.</b> After several days, Rockefeller was found at his lawyer's estate, Taconic Farm in northwestern Massachusetts, and was served with the subpoena. The tycoon duly came to Landis's Chicago courtroom, making his way through a mob anxious to see the proceedings. Rockefeller's actual testimony, proffered after the judge made him wait through several cases and witnesses, proved to be anticlimactic, as he professed almost no knowledge of Standard Oil's corporate structure or assets.|$|E
