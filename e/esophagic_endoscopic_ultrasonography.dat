40|$|CONTEXT: <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> is {{considered}} a highly accurate procedure for diagnosing small pancreatic tumors and assessing their locoregional extension. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> on the management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in clinical practice. PATIENTS: Sixty-four consecutive patients (mean age 70. 5 plus/minus 11. 9 years) hospitalized for staging or diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma were retrospectively (from January 1995 to November 1997) or prospectively studied (from December 1997 to August 1999). SETTING: Group 1 consisted of 52 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma which was discovered using computerized tomography scanning and/or ultrasound. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was utilized for staging purposes only in patients who {{were considered to be}} operable and the tumor to be resectable based on computerized tomography scanning criteria. Group 2 consisted of 12 patients who were diagnosed as having a pancreatic adenocarcinoma using <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> whereas computerized tomography scanning and ultrasound was negative. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The impact of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was analyzed {{on the basis of the}} number of patients requiring <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> as a staging procedure (Group 1) and by evaluating the performance of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in determining resectability (Groups 1 and 2) based on the surgical and anatomopathological results. RESULTS: <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was performed in 20 out of 64 patients (31. 3 %) : 8 / 52 in Group 1 (15. 4 %) and all 12 patients of Group 2. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> correctly assessed an absolute contraindication to resection in 11 cases. Resection was confirmed in 8 of the 9 cases selected by <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> The positive predictive value, negative predictive value and overall accuracy of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> for determining resection were 89 %, 100 %, and 95 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> seems especially relevant for the detection of pancreatic tumors after negative computerized tomography scanning, and for the prevention of unnecessary laparotomies as complementary staging after ultrasonography and computerized tomography scanning...|$|R
40|$|<b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was {{performed}} in 8 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the stomach. Findings consisted of intramural infiltration or mucosal alteration together with perigastric lymph nodes, or both. Lymph node involvement was suggested {{by the presence of}} inhomogeneous hypoechoic echopatterns with clearly demarcated borders. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was more accurate than computed tomography scan in the detection of transmural extent of malignancy and adjacent lymph node involvement.

40|$|AbstractObjective: <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> is {{frequently}} used to locally stage esophageal cancer, but few studies exist to validate its accuracy for lymph node metastases. Our {{objective was to}} compare <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> with video-assisted thoracoscopic and laparoscopic staging in evaluating lymph node metastases in esophageal cancer. Methods: Twenty-six patients with potentially resectable esophageal cancer were identified by conventional imaging. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was performed followed by laparoscopic and thoracoscopic staging, and locoregional staging was compared. Results: In eight patients <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> indicated N 0 disease, but laparoscopy and thoracoscopy documented N 1 disease in six. In five of 26 (19 %) obstruction prevented endoscopic ultrasonography; three had N 1 by laparoscopy and thoracoscopy. Thirteen patients had N 1 disease according to <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography,</b> and 12 of 13 (92 %) had N 1 disease by laparoscopy and thoracoscopy. The sensitivity and specificity of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> for nodal evaluation were 65 % and 66 %, respectively. Sensitivity decreased to 44 % for lymph node metastases less than 1 cm. No instances of T 4 disease were found by surgical staging when <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> indicated T 3 disease. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> revealed no distant metastases in any patient, but in four of 26 (15 %) laparoscopy identified liver metastases. Conclusions: The accuracy of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in the diagnosis of lymph node metastases in esophageal cancer was 65 % and only 44 % for lymph node metastases less than 1 cm diameter. Laparoscopy and thoracoscopy improved the accuracy of staging lymph node metastases in esophageal cancer and {{had the advantage of}} evaluating the thoracic and abdominal cavities for metastases.

40|$|In {{order to}} localise neuroendocrine tumours of the foregut type (that is, of the stomach, duodenum, and pancreas), 18 {{patients}} were studied prospectively by <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography,</b> computed tomography, transabdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. These 18 patients {{had a total}} of 25 primary tumour lesions which were verified histologically in tissue obtained by surgery or by ultrasound or endoscopy guided biopsy. Tumours {{were found in the}} stomach (n = 1), duodenum (n = 6), pancreas (n = 17), and liver (n = 1). <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> had the highest sensitivity for tumour detection, followed by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, computed tomography, transabdominal ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (88 %, 52 %, 36 %, 32 %, and 24 % respectively). <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was especially sensitive in tumours smaller than 2 cm in diameter (88 % v somatostatin receptor scintigraphy 35 %; computed tomography 12 %; transabdominal ultrasonography 6 %; and magnetic resonance imaging 0 %). Of 17 tumours located in the pancreas, <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> showed a sensitivity of 94 % (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy 47 %; computed tomography 47 %; transabdominal ultrasonography 41 %; and magnetic resonance imaging 29 %). Of eight extrapancreatic tumours, six were identified by <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography,</b> five by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, and only one by computed tomography, transabdominal ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging. One neuroendocrine tumour that was not detected by <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was correctly identified by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. Endoscopic ultrasound allowed correct determination of the tumour size and tumour spread into parapancreatic structures, especially the large vessels (T stage), in all 14 patients operated upon.

In summary, <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy were the most sensitive imaging methods for the localisation of these tumours and should be used as early diagnostic procedures to accurately stage neuroendocrine tumours of the foregut type...|$|R
40|$|Objective 　To {{investigate}} <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> {{diagnosis and}} classification of gastric fundus-cardiac tumors originated from the muscularis propria. Methods 　One hundred and two patients with gastric fundus-cardiac submucosal tumors originated from the muscularis propria were diagnosed by <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> from Jan, 2011 to Jun, 2015. All patients were treated by endoscopy or surgery, and diagnosed by postoperative pathology and immunohistochemistry staining. These cases were analyzed retrospectively. Results 　The 102 patients with gastric fundus-cardiac tumors originated from the muscularis propria included 39 men and 63 women. Their ages were from 25 - 85 years old, average 56. 22 ± 11. 98 years. The tumor sizes were from 0. 4 to 10. 4 cm, average 3. 72 ± 2. 18 cm. The patients were diagnosed having leiomyoma in 81 and interstitialoma in 21 by preoperative <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> Postoperative pathology and immunohistochemistry staining confirmed that leiomyoma was misdiagnosed as mesenchymoma in 5 patients. The misdiagnosis rate of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> for gastric fundus-cardiac tumors originated from the muscularis propria was 4. 9 % (5 / 102).

40|$|Background and Objectives: Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) {{has been}} used as the method of choice in assessment of obstructive jaundice for a long time. Recently, the development of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> (EUS) has attracted the attention of clinicians as an alternative accurate, safe and cheap method to replace the ERCP procedures performed only for diagnostic purposes. Methods: In this study, 100 patients underwent <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in Digestive Disease Research Center, Shariati Hospital. The patients were divided into two groups: 1) those with operable periampullary tumors who were referred to the surgeons, 2) other patients. The final diagnosis made after ERCP and operative removal of the mass was considered as the gold standard and was compared with accuracy of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> Results: The overall accuracy of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in the diagnosis of obstructive cholestasis was 92. 0 %. Sensitivity and specificity of this method in diagnosis of choledocholithiasis were 95. 2 % and 96. 4 % respectively. The corresponding values for diagnosis of periampullary tumors were 96. 2 % and 95. 8 %. Conclusion: In this study the accuracy of EUS in diagnosis of obstructive jaundice and its sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of choledocholithiasis and periampullary tumors were high.

40|$|The role of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in the {{management}} of cystic lesions of the pancreas Objective. To review the role of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in {{the management}} of cystic lesions of the pancreas. Data sources. MEDLINE literature search (1998 - 2003). Study selection.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to prospectively {{evaluate}} <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and microscopic examination of duodenal bile in the diagnosis of cholecystolithiasis not detected by conventional ultrasonography. Forty five consecutive patients (26 females, 19 males, mean age: 50 years) with suspected cholecystolithiasis and at least two normal transcutaneous ultrasonography examinations were included. Endoscopic ultrasonographic criteria for the diagnosis of cholecystolithiasis were the presence of stones with or without acoustic shadowing or sludge. Criteria of microscopic examination of bile were cholesterol or bilirubinate crystals or spheroliths. Thirty three patients underwent cholecystectomy and lithiasis was found in gall bladder bile in 24.

The aetiologies of all patients were determined after complete evaluations, and clinico-biochemical characteristics of patients with a biliary cause (biliary group) and non-biliary causes (non-biliary group) were compared. Results: Biliary pancreatitis was diagnosed in 107 patients and 32 patients had non-biliary causes. The biliary group belonged to a significantly older age group, had a female predominance, significantly more derangement of liver function and {{a higher incidence of}} severe attack of acute pancreatitis. On multivariate analysis, female sex, age > 58 years and serum alanine aminotransferase > 150 U/L were independent predictive factors for biliary cause of acute pancreatitis.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Esophageal {{leiomyoma}} is {{the most}} common benign tumor of the esophagus, and it originates from mesenchymal tissue. This study analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics of esophageal leiomyoma and aimed to evaluate the role of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in the diagnosis and treatment selection for these lesions. METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-five patients who had suspected esophageal leiomyomas in <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> were enrolled at the Endoscopy Center of The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University from January 1 st, 2009 to May 31 th, 2015. The main outcomes included the demographic and morphological characteristics, symptoms, comparisons of diagnosis and treatment methods, adverse events, and prognosis. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-seven patients were diagnosed as having an esophageal leiomyoma by pathological examination. The mean patient age was 50. 57 ± 9. 983 years. In total, 62. 9 % of the lesions originated from the muscularis mucosa, and the others originated from the muscularis propria. The median distance to the incisors was 30 ± 12 cm. The median diameter was 0. 72 ± 0. 99 cm. As determined by <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasonography,</b> most existing leiomyomas were homogeneous, endophytic, and spherical. The leiomyomas from the muscularis mucosa were smaller than those from the muscularis propria and much closer to the incisors (p< 0. 05). SMA (smooth muscle antibody) (97. 2 %) and desmin (94. 5 %) were positive in the majority of patients. In terms of treatments, patients preferred endoscopic therapies, which led to less adverse events (e. g., intraoperative bleeding, local infection, pleural effusion) than surgical operations (p< 0. 05). The superficial leiomyomas presented less adverse events and better recovery (p< 0. 05) than deep leiomyomas.
