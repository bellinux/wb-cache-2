To establish the feasibility of introducing SPs as 'known' patients (i. e. patients who have previously visited the practice) into practices, to indicate the required practice preparations, and to describe the various aspects of using SPs in a pretest/post-test design. We used incognito SPs as known patients in a controlled trial to assess the practice behaviour of 49 trainees. The SPs received a 2 -day training in role playing and completing checklists. We compiled comprehensive practice <b>information</b> <b>folders</b> of each practice to be visited. Real personal data and faked medical data of SPs were inserted in the filing system of each practice to be visited. Apart from SP roles with slightly different reasons-for-encounter and different SPs, the same training protocol, checklists and practice <b>information</b> <b>folders</b> {{were used in the}} post-test. The SPs carried out 287 visits in 50 practices. All practices prepared the patient records for the SP visits in a fairly authentic practice style. Trainees detected the SP in 74 visits. The main reasons for detection were imperfections in patient records and aspects of SP roles or role playing. Fielding incognito SP visits as known patients was feasible but labour-intensive. Preparing the SP patient records and familiarising SPs with the interior of practices represented new elements in the use of SPs.

40|$|In many {{instances}} the Austrian UNESCO Biosphere Reserves as model regions {{of sustainable development}} are outshone by other conservation categories, such as national parks or world heritage sites, and are largely unknown to the wider population. This shadowy existence is ill deserved. The modern concept of biosphere reserves (BRs) is more important today than it ever was {{if we want to}} maintain valuable cultural landscapes for later generations. The Austrian MAB National Committee therefore made it a priority to greatly increase the popularity of our BRs and to underline their significance for sustainability research. Moreover, efforts in this vein should involve young people.

40|$|Despite the {{well-documented}} side-effects {{and disadvantages}} of long-term use, the prevalence of benzodiazepine use stays high. The purpose of this intervention was to inventarise {{the number of patients}} in our practice who take benzodiazepines and to reduce their consumption. Therefore we registered all the patients who came to renew their prescription of their benzodiazepine during six months. Afterwards a letter and an <b>information</b> <b>folder</b> were sent to all those patients between 25 and 75 year, with chronic use of benzodiazepine in the practice who took it as a hypnoticum and who didn’t met the exclusion criteria, to motivate them to reduce their benzodiazepine consumption. 65 Patients were selected in this way. Three months after sending this letter, we called the patients who didn’t answer the letter by telephone to invite them for a consult in practice to talk about this problem and to offer them a discontinuation program if they didn’t succeed to reduce their dose by themselves. The main finding was that a minimal intervention {{in the form of a}} letter was effective for reducing benzodiazepine consumption. 32, 3 % of the patients reduced their consumption (16, 9 % stopped completely) More-intensive treatment afterwards with a discontinuation program in patients who couldn’t stop or reduce their benzodiazepine use gave an additional effect of 32, 2 % (6 % stopped, 26, 2 % reduced their consumption) Conclusion: 58 % Of the selected patients reduced their consumption, 21 % stopped completely.

40|$|This {{action plan}} {{provides}} guidelines for {{preservation of the}} endangered plant Elatine hexandra (Six-stamened Waterwort) in Sweden. The action plan is a proposal, not a legally binding document. Elatine hexandra is a small, aquatic or amphibious, vascular herb in the family Elatinaceae. In Sweden, it usually appears as a summer annual on {{the very edge of}} freshwater lakes or streams. Some populations have over-wintering individuals that occur at depths well below the ice-cover. Typically, the habitat is a moderately wave exposed littoral with inorganic, silty-sandy substrate, covered with a thin layer of mud. The lake habitats have clear water, a near neutral pH and may rep-resent one of the two lake types that are included in the habitat directive, i. e. “Oligotrophic waters containing very few minerals of sandy plains” and “Oligotrophic to mesotrophic standing waters with vegetation of the Littorelletea uniflorae and/or of the Isoëto-Nanojuncetea”. The species has been found in approx. 55 Swedish lakes or running waters since 1980. With a few exceptions, the occurrences are restricted to river basins of southwest Sweden with outlets in Skagerrak and Kattegat (County Administration Boards of Värmland, Västra Götaland, Jönköping, Halland and Kronoberg). In the Swedish red list Elatine hexandra is classified as Endangered (EN). The main threats include deteriorating water quality. Eutrophication, acidification and brownification (increase in water color and dissolved organic matter) have adverse effects on growth and reproduction of the species. Other threats include exploitation of shorelines and water level regulations. The action plan proposes measures against deteriorating water quality in lakes with known occurrences of Elatine hexandra. Further, it points out the need for revision and ecological considerations of present water level regulations. Other suggestions aims to increase the conservation awareness among land owners, nature resource managers and municipality planners. These suggestions include production and spread of an <b>information</b> <b>folder</b> and implementation of conservation related information in the database WISS (Water Information System Sweden). WISS is an open information tool used in the planning cycle of river basin management. Finally, the action plan proposes additional investigations of the distribution in lakes and of the presence in seed-banks, as well as field studies on how growth and reproduction is affected by water regulations. With help of these results, lakes suitable for restoration measures can be selected. The action plan is valid for the period 2013 - 2018 and the costs are estimated to approx. 1 430 000 SE...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an upsurge in {{products}} and activities designed for infants, what is known as baby culture. The essay is a discourse analysis covering the part of baby culture which is concerned with infants and books. The essay studies texts from libraries and children’s bookclubs in order to understand what it is they communicate, to whom and the conceivable consequences of the communicated message. One of the main purposes of the study is to determine what view of infants as social and cultural beings it  is that arises from the texts. The essay also focuses on the different discourse types used in the discourse on infants and books and to what extent the libraries’ and the bookclubs’ way of reasoning on the subject is differing. The theoretical basis of the study is inspired by Norman Fairclough’s Critical Discourse Analysis and concentrates on the communicative event. The method used is detailed textual analysis rooted in Fairclough’s three- dimensional model of discursive practice, text and social practice. The empirical material consists of texts from <b>information</b> <b>folders,</b> websites etc. The result of the analysis shows that the discourse on infants and books is very similar in the two domains and derives from a wider market- oriented discourse. The discourse constitutes infants as primarily early learners with the inherent potential of becoming a baby genius. The discourse also constitutes a good reading parent who invests in his/her child’s future by stimulating their brain development from a very early age. An examination of the baby market discourse shows that it is a hybrid discourse consisting of various discourse types from diverse (knowledge) domains such as medicine, psychology and pedagogy. The analysis shows how market discourses have infiltrated the discourses of public institutions such as the library and how it affects the way subject entities are constructed...|$|R

40|$|Early {{detection}} of cervical changes through gynaecological screening {{serves as a}} good protection against cervical cancer. The mortality rate from cervical cancer has declined by 60 percent during the past 40 years. Still about 80 women {{in the region of}} Västra Götaland are annually diagnosed with cervical cancer and 20 - 25 patients die. In the region of Västra Götaland women aged between 23 - 60 years are invited to Papnicolau (Pap) testing within the cervical cancer-screening program. However, in the northeast part of Gothenburg only around 60 percent of the females are taking the test. The overall percentage for the entire region was 82 percent and the regional goal is that no parish should test less than 70 percent. In northeast Gothenburg 50 percent of the residents are foreign born. Almost no effort has previously been made by Swedish healthcare to recruit foreign born women to undergo Pap smear tests. Therefore, a project group was formed in the spring of 2010. National and international research was reviewed; the barriers for foreign born women to not taking the test included lack of knowledge about why the test should be taken but also an inability to assimilate information in Swedish and, finally, unavailable childcare. Using social networks and focusing on verbal information given by friends or healthcare staff with the same cultural background could encourage more women to undergo a Pap smear test. In the northeast part of Gothenburg the so called doulas are already well established, primarily supporting new parents during pregnancy and childbirth. The doulas have the same cultural background as the parents they support. In this project, the doulas were informed by a midwife about the importance of taking Pap smear tests. They were also asked to encourage women in their surrounding communities to take the test. Having taken part of previous experiences of health promoting activities in the area also inspired the project group to use additional channels to reach the women, e. g. through local associations, radio stations and at public places. By bringing a friend whilst taking a Pap smear test the women would have emotional support, simultaneously solving the problem with unavailable childcare. The friend who accompanied the woman would be given a small gift. The project group decided to encourage the women by embracing a positive approach and with the message: “Take the test and take control of your life!” On the international women’s day in March of 2011 a seminar was held and “Bring a Friend” was introduced to politicians, officials, health care professionals, the doulas and the public. “Bring a Friend” was launched in April of 2011. At the same time leaflets and <b>information</b> <b>folders</b> were produced and translated into a number of languages. The summons to the Pap smear test to the women in northeast Gothenburg were accompanied by a leaflet with information about Pap smear in 11 different languages. During the spring and autumn the midwives and the doulas participated in various events, information was aired in the local radio and exposed in waiting rooms, newsletters and on the Internet. An interview with the doulas was conducted to investigate their experience in meeting the women. Postcards, posters, pin and monitors showing the “Bring a Friend” logotype were visible around the area and a modified bus made it possible to take a Pap smear test at strategically located places in the northeast part of the city. Between April and October of 2011 a total of 3 233 Pap smear tests had been taken. During the same period the previous year there were only 2 034 tests. Healthcare professionals noticed that groups that were known for not taking Pap smear tests now showed up.

The failure to learn from past mistakes is rather not deliberate but due to unawareness of the situation. Incident databases are excellent resources to learn from past mistakes; however, in order to be effective, incident databases need to be functional in disseminating the lessons learned to users. Therefore, this research is dedicated to improving user accessibility of incident databases. The objective of this research is twofold. The first objective is improving accessibility of the database system by allowing the option of word search as well as folder search for the users. This will satisfy research needs of users who are aware of the hazards at hand and need to access the relevant information. The second objective is to activate the database via integration of the database with an operational software. This will benefit research needs of users who are unaware of the existing hazards. Literature review and text mining of Major Accident Reporting System (MARS) database short reports are employed to develop an initial taxonomy, which is then refined and modified by expert review. The incident reports in MARS database is classified to the right folders in the taxonomy and implemented in a database system based on Microsoft Excel, where the users can retrieve <b>information</b> using <b>folder</b> search as well as word search option via a user friendly interface. A program coded in JAVA is prepared for integrating the incident database with a Management of Change (MOC) software prototype. A collection of keywords on hazardous substances and equipment is prepared. If the keywords exist in the MOC interface, they will be highlighted, and with the click of a button, will return up to ten relevant incident reports. Using an active and knowledge-based system, people can learn from incidents and near-misses and will be more active to reduce the frequency of recurring incidents...|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{is a lack}} of high quality, child-centred and {{effective}} health information to support development of self-care practices and expertise in children with acute and long-term conditions. In type 1 diabetes, clinical guidelines indicate that high-quality, child-centred information underpins achievement of optimal glycaemic control with the aim of minimising acute readmissions and reducing the risk of complications in later life. This paper describes the development of a range of child-centred diabetes information resources and outlines the study design and protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the information resources in routine practice. The aim of the diabetes information intervention is to improve children and young people’s quality of life by increasing self-efficacy in managing their type 1 diabetes. Methods/Design: We used published evidence, undertook qualitative research and consulted with children, young people and key stakeholders to design and produce a range of child-centred, age-appropriate children’s diabetes diaries, carbohydrate recording sheets, and assembled child-centred, age-appropriate diabetes information packs containing published <b>information</b> in a <b>folder</b> that can be personalized by children and young people with pens and stickers. Resources have been designed for children/young people 6 - 10; 11 - 15; and 16 - 18 years. To evaluate the information resources, we designed a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{validate}} the test items of science achievement, which were used as a test at Pancasakti Science Competition, in order to obtain enough valid test items with the Rasch model application. Validation model used in this research is Messick validity covering aspects such as (1) content, (2) substantive, (3) structural, (4) external and (5) consequential. To achieve these objectives, this study investigates the quality of the items that include matching items, Person-Items <b>Folder,</b> Person/Item <b>Folder,</b> <b>Information</b> Function Tests, Person Fit Statistic, Collapsed Deviance, Casewise Deviance, Hosmer-Lemeshow, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, unidimensional, invariance, separation and DIF. The test was given in the form of multiple choice as many as 40 items consisting of 15 items of physics, 10 items of chemistry, and 15 items of chemistry. The participants were 85 biology students with the test time allocation of 60 minutes. Item analysis was conducted by using R 3 : 12 Program, eRm package version 0. 15 - 6. The study results showed that the test items of science achievement were proven valid by the application of Rasch Model. The test items have met construct validity according to Messick (1996) which includes such aspects: (1) content, (2) substantive, (3) Structural, (4) External and (5) consequential. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Geodatabases in ArcGIS can {{be stored}} in three {{different}} ways – as a [...] "file geodatabase", a [...] "personal geodatabase", or an [...] "ArcSDE geodatabase". [...] Introduced at 9.2, the file geodatabase stores <b>information</b> in a <b>folder</b> named with a [...]gdb extension. The insides look similar to that of a coverage but is not, in fact, a coverage. Similar to the personal geodatabase, the file geodatabase only supports a single editor. However, unlike the personal geodatabase, there is virtually no size limit. By default, any single table cannot exceed 1TB, but this can be changed. [...] Personal geodatabases store data in Microsoft Access files, using a BLOB field to store the geometry data. [...] The OGR library is able to handle this file type, to convert it to other file formats. [...] Database administration tasks for personal geodatabases, such as managing users and creating backups, can be done through ArcCatalog. [...] Personal geodatabases, which are based on Microsoft Access, run only on Microsoft Windows and have a 2 gigabyte size limit. [...] Enterprise (multi-user) level geodatabases are handled using ArcSDE, which interfaces with high-end DBMS such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, DB2 and Informix to handle database management aspects, while ArcGIS deals with spatial data management. [...] Enterprise level geodatabases support database replication, versioning and transaction management, and are cross-platform compatible, able to run on Linux, Windows, and Solaris.|$|R
