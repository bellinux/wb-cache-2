40|$|This paper proposes an {{alternative}} approach <b>in</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>analysis</b> to significance testing. It argues that testing the null-hypotheses H 0 : ρ = 0 versus the H 1 : ρ > 0 is not an optimal strategy. This is because rejecting the null-hypothesis, as traditionally reported in social science papers – i. e. a significant correlation coefficient (regardless of how many asterisks it is adorned with) – very often has no practical meaning. Confirming a population’s correlation coefficient as being merely unequal to zero does not entail much gain of content information, unless this correlation coefficient is sufficiently large enough; and this in turn means that the correlation explains a relevant amount of variance. The alternative approach, however, tests the composite null-hypothesis H 0 : 0 0...|$|E
