5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be completed}} <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> than other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. These features of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E
5|$|The baths {{have been}} {{modified}} on several occasions, including the 12th century, when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King's Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, {{when the city}} corporation built a new bath (Queen's Bath) {{to the south of}} the spring. The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings, designed by architects John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger, father and son. Visitors drank the waters in the Grand Pump Room, a neo-classical salon which remains in use, both for taking the waters and for social functions. Victorian expansion of the baths complex followed the neo-classical tradition established by the Woods. In 1810 the hot springs failed and William Smith opened up the Hot Bath Spring to the bottom, where he found that the spring had not failed but had flowed into a new channel. Smith restored the water to its original course and the baths filled <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> than before.|$|E

25|$|Mr. Tulliver did not willingly write a letter, {{and found}} the {{relation}} between spoken and written language, briefly known as spelling, {{one of the most}} puzzling things in this puzzling world. Nevertheless, like all fervid writing, the task was done <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> than usual, and if the spelling differed from Mrs. Glegg's,–why, she belonged, like himself, to a generation with whom spelling was a matter of private judgment.|$|E
25|$|Automated {{theorem proving}} {{refers to the}} {{development}} of computer programs that search and find derivations (formal proofs) of mathematical theorems. Finding derivations is a difficult task because the search space can be very large; an exhaustive search of every possible derivation is theoretically possible but computationally infeasible for many systems of interest in mathematics. Thus complicated heuristic functions are developed to attempt to find a derivation <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> than a blind search.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{gamma rays}} emitted by the source that {{pass through the}} {{detector}} will produce a count in the system. The probability that an emitted gamma ray will interact with the detector and produce a count is {{the efficiency of the}} detector. High-efficiency detectors produce spectra <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> than low-efficiency detectors. In general, larger detectors have higher efficiency than smaller detectors, although the shielding properties of the detector material are also important factors. Detector efficiency is measured by comparing a spectrum from a source of known activity to the count rates in each peak to the count rates expected from the known intensities of each gamma ray.|$|E

25|$|In brachytherapy, {{radiation}} {{sources are}} precisely placed {{directly at the}} site of the cancerous tumour. This means that the irradiation only affects a very localized area – exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources is reduced. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over external beam radiation therapy – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localized radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues. A course of brachytherapy can often be completed <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> than other radiation therapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance of surviving cancer cells dividing and growing in the intervals between each radiation therapy dose.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco {{production}} {{requires the}} use of large amounts of pesticides. Tobacco companies recommend up to 16 separate applications of pesticides just in the period between planting the seeds in greenhouses and transplanting the young plants to the field. Pesticide use has been worsened by the desire to produce larger crops <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> because of the decreasing market value of tobacco. Pesticides often harm tobacco farmers because they are unaware of the health effects and the proper safety protocol for working with pesticides. These pesticides, as well as fertilizers, end up in the soil, waterways, and the food chain. Coupled with child labor, pesticides pose an even greater threat. Early exposure to pesticides may increase a child's lifelong cancer risk, as well as harm his or her nervous and immune systems.|$|E
25|$|Miller won {{his first}} overall World Cup title in 2005, {{defeating}} Austrians Benjamin Raich and Hermann Maier. He made history {{early in the season}} by winning at least one race {{in each of the four}} standard World Cup disciplines: slalom, giant slalom, super-G and downhill. In winning a slalom in Sestriere on December 13, he joined Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg, who had been the first man to accomplish this feat in 1989. Miller accomplished the feat <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> than any previous ski racer, male or female; the victory was his sixth of the season after only ten races. At the 2005 World Championships in Bormio, Italy, he won two gold medals, in super-G and downhill. In the downhill portion of the combined, he lost a ski 16 seconds into the race, but decided to continue down the course nevertheless at speeds up to 83km/h on one ski, before sliding out near the bottom nearly two minutes later.|$|E

500|$|Sierra {{described}} the game's development as challenging because portable consoles lack the processing power of larger machines. Rebellion {{complained about the}} PSP's lack of a second analog thumbstick, stating that it made creating a usable control scheme challenging. They also stated that because the game's protagonist preferred to work alone, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem would not contain a multiplayer cooperative mode for the single-player campaign, but a [...] "Survival Mode" [...] minigame would be available where two players could work together to fight Aliens. The game had a relatively short development cycle, and was made <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> than the movie.|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} lyrics, Eno would later play these backing tracks singing {{nonsense}} syllables to himself, then take them and form them into actual words, phrases and meaning. This lyric-writing method {{was used for}} all his more vocal-based recordings of the 1970s. The lyrics on Here Come the Warm Jets are macabre with an underlying sense of humour. They are mostly free-associative and have no particular meaning. Exceptions include [...] "The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch", about the historical A.W. Underwood of Paw Paw, Michigan with the purported ability to set items ablaze with his breath; according to Eno, the song [...] "celebrates {{the possibility of a}} love affair with the man." [...] Eno has attempted to dissuade fans from reading too much into his words; he claims that the song [...] "Needles in the Camel's Eye" [...] was [...] "written <b>in</b> <b>less</b> <b>time</b> than it takes to sing... I regard [...] as an instrumental with singing on it".|$|E
