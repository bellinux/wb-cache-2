The hydraulic fracturing technique is a method of well stimulation in which liquid under high pressure is pumped down a well to fracture the reservoir rock adjacent to the wellbore. Propping agents are used to keep the fractures/cracks open. They can be made from the reject of mineral extraction processes when they present specifics characteristic. The aim of this paper is the evaluation of the use of <b>industrial</b> <b>rejects</b> to the development of ceramic synthetic proppants that are resistant to chemical corrosion and high mechanical strength in aqueous acid and salt water environment. In this study, <b>industrial</b> <b>rejects</b> from nickel sulfide ore flotation (grey mud - GM), red mud (RM) from Bayer process and black mud (BM) from Caron processing of nickel was used as raw material for the production of ceramic synthetic proppants. The material processing was performed through drying, milling, pressing, sintering and characterizing raw material. Several characterization techniques such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), high temperature dilatometry and compression strength test were performed after sintering to evaluate the technological potential of recycling these metallurgical and mineral rejects.

40|$|Abstract. The nexus {{that exists}} between {{industrial}} policy and competitiveness appears questionable. Authors including Professor Michael Porter <b>reject</b> <b>industrial</b> policy {{as a means to}} achieve com-petitiveness, arguing that this policy distorts competition in favour of a particular location, as opposed to his diamond theory, the latter seeking to remove constraints to productivity growth. This paper argues that despite Maltaâs size, resource limitations and insularity, enhanced competitiveness resulting from a pro-active industrial policy is possible, provided that the definition and scope of industrial policy is aligned as much as possible to the Porterian diamond concept. This is particularly so if one wishes to see the local economy transformed from its largely current factor-driven state, to a mainly investment-driven stage. Maltaâs current industrial policy is as-sessed through Porterian lenses, and it is submitted that the feasibility of business clustering has yet to be comprehensively evaluated. This together with recent initiatives to seriously tackle the competitiveness issueâseveral of which are praiseworthyâ leave a number of unanswered questions, particularly regarding {{the extent to which the}} local authorities accept the âdiamond â underly-ing national competitive advantage, as well as the manner in which co-ordination of all aspects of industrial policy should be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Australia and New Zealand {{developed}} distinctive 'wage-earner welfare states', {{with social}} protection largely delivered through high breadwinner basic incomes and residual social policies. Market reforms then pursued {{in both countries}} during the 1980 s and 1990 s retrenched important elements of the Antipodean model. Our article offers a novel characterization of major reforms to both welfare states from the mid- 1990 s to the early 2010 s. We focus on industrial relations, {{as a form of}} wage-earner welfare, and expansions to social provision for families and retirees that may be viewed as responding to the evolving needs of wage-earners as family patterns diversify and populations age. Policy reversals complicate the picture of the long-term path of <b>industrial</b> relations. Voters <b>rejected</b> the Employment Contracts Act in New Zealand in 2000 and WorkChoices in Australia in 2007, with incoming labour governments moderating policy to favour wage-earner expectations of decent wages and fair bargaining. Alongside this, governments expanded both paternalistic social policies and private social provision. We argue these changes taken together produced a 'hollowing out' of wage-earner welfare in both countries, accompanied by increasingly stratified welfare, which marginalizes and stigmatizes many outside the workforce. But, we also note persistent differences, reflecting the more radical and 'pure' New Zealand experiment, its relatively centralized politics and stronger liberal tradition. Hence, Australia retains more progressive taxation and family support less connected with employment status, while making greater use of tax expenditures to support private welfare. 24 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{looks at}} genre {{as a complex}} set of discursive threads running {{unevenly}} through production, TV text, and fan reception. Through a case study of the reception of fan favorite Roswell, this essay interrogates the role of genre in spectatorship. In its mixing of teen and science fiction elements, Roswell trod upon contested generic spaces, eliciting strong reaction from its viewers. Connections between genre and gender came to the fore, as producer commentary linked science fiction with male audiences and teen romance with female audiences. Fans responded with analyses that greatly complicated and at times overtly <b>rejected</b> <b>industrial</b> suppositions regarding the gendered work of genre. Through these fan conversations, we can witness the complexity of genre as discursive thread moving through not only TV texts but also multivariant fan responses. I intend this essay to work at two levels. My analysis of fan responses to Roswell models the possibilities of a close study of genre discourse. At the same time, my case study probes the nature of genre in fan engagement, as genre discourses intersect with other fan concerns such as character identification, perceptions of textual quality, and questions of gender representation. While we cannot necessarily look to fan accounts for proof of how viewers engage with genre, they do tell us how fans frame their engagement with genre, how they incorporate genre into their performance of fannishness, and how they perform and thus enact genre itself as a shared cultural process...|$|R

Wet towers are usually {{designed}} to operate in hot and dry weather conditions, but wet cooling towers operating in Ahvaz climate suffer from mixed weather conditions that strongly affect the thermal performance of the towers. Operating inmixedweather conditions and fouling on fills are two major concerns for towers working in the direct reduction unit of Khuzestan Steel Company (KSC), Ahvaz. The {{first step is to}} model the thermal behaviour of the tower under the present operating conditions. Two mathematical models (the conventional Merkel model and the dimensionless Halasz model) are applied in this step and the results of the models for the outlet water temperature in nine various operating conditions are compared with experimental data. Prevailing fill characteristic curves for three cell halves of the tower are obtained using a numericalâexperimental method. At the second step, the results of the chemical analysis of foul-ing material and circulating water are considered to obtain the main factor of scale forming in the tower. The tendency of water to scale forming is investigated using three conventional scaling criteria. The analysis of water and fouling material shows that both air and water have important fouling and scaling effects on fills. Finally, several approaches are proposed to reduce these dete-riorating effects of air and water. The effect of placing an impact separator in front of air louvers (to reduce suspended solids of the air) on the thermal performance of the tower is investigated...|$|R

Credita-se a Manuel Mafra (1831 - 1905), ser o introdutor desta cerÃ¢mica artÃ­stica sui generis em Caldas, vindo a desenvolver uma obra notÃ¡vel com assinalÃ¡vel Ãªxito, nacional e, sobretudo, internacional, possibilitada pelo seu gÃ©nio e habilidade, pela especificidade da regiÃ£o em que se desenvolveu, bem como pelo apreÃ§o e apoio que recebeu da Casa Real. NÃ£o obstante ser um oleiro oriundo de um meio rural, Manuel Mafra desenvolveu um percurso profissional notÃ¡vel, recebeu o honroso tÃ­tulo de Fornecedor Real e viu a sua obra guindada aos mais elevados patamares, adquirida para ornamentar os espaÃ§os dos palÃ¡cios reais, Necessidades, Pena, e Vila ViÃ§osa. A sua obra foi largamente exportada para paÃ­ses estrangeiros, e premiada nas Grandes ExposiÃ§Ãµes Internacionais, desde 1867, na ExposiÃ§Ã£o de Paris, com continuidade nos certames seguintes. A absorÃ§Ã£o de correntes estÃ©ticas internacionais por Manuel Mafra, e a sua coexistÃªncia com a tradiÃ§Ã£o, marca esta produÃ§Ã£o, cuja identidade/alteridade se encontra ainda por analisar e fundamentar, quanto Ã s suas origens e caracterizaÃ§Ã£o, constituindo um desafio tÃ£o difÃ­cil como irresistÃ­vel. Conhecer a obra de Mafra, pressupÃµe a anÃ¡lise de outras obras cerÃ¢micas, que embora afastadas temporalmente, convergem numa questÃ£o central, a ligaÃ§Ã£o estilÃ­stica entre a longÃ­nqua obra do autor francÃªs do Renascimento, Bernard Palissy, o seu renascer na cerÃ¢mica naturalista /revivalista francesa e inglesa do sÃ©culo XIX, e a sua recepÃ§Ã£o e radicaÃ§Ã£o em Portugal, na cerÃ¢mica caldense. Esta cerÃ¢mica, e a aceitaÃ§Ã£o de que foi alvo, levantam questÃµes fulcrais, como a anÃ¡lise da iconografia que a percorre, as fontes onde se inspira e, tambÃ©m, como reflexo do imaginÃ¡rio de uma sociedade, e do seu gosto. Permite desvendar, atravÃ©s da observaÃ§Ã£o do seu gosto artÃ­stico, a mentalidade de uma elite portuguesa do sÃ©culo XIX, que, antes de se deleitar com as sossegadas e palpÃ¡veis paisagens das telas de Malhoa e com as naturezas vivas/mortas em louÃ§a de Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro, se deixa fascinar, adquirindo as peÃ§as romÃ¢nticas e perturbadoras de um ceramista como Manuel Mafra. Obra muito apreciada, mas tambÃ©m alvo de fortes crÃ­ticas por estudiosos portugueses, como Joaquim de Vasconcelos, defensor dos valores mais intrÃ­nsecos da arte portuguesa para os produtos da indÃºstria, e rejeitando as imitaÃ§Ãµes de modelos estrangeiros e antiquados. A obra de Mafra, se por um lado explica as origens da cerÃ¢mica artÃ­stica caldense, por outro, traduz e permite perceber o conflito vivido na altura entre o implantar da industrializaÃ§Ã£o e as questÃµes levantadas por movimentos e autores que, seguindo directrizes inovadoras do Arts and Crafts e Aesthetic Movement, clamam pelo estudo do desenho, uso de um bom design e a aplicaÃ§Ã£o das artes Ã s indÃºstrias que vÃ£o prevalecer nas relaÃ§Ãµes manufactura/ indÃºstria e arte da Ã©poca, e culminar em expressÃµes de modernidade como a Arte Nova e Art DÃ©co. Caldas da Rainha {{in the mid}} nineteenth-century saw the {{emergence}} of a distinctive ceramic ware, intentionally embodied in artistic features, a style clearly marked by decorative elements of flora and fauna applied in high-relief, associated with knowledge and emulation of foreign aesthetic trends, inspired in the Italian majolicas and sixteenth-century neo-Palissy faiences. Manuel Mafra (1831 - 1905) is credited introducing this sui generis style in Caldas, creating an amazing amount of wares with enormous success, both at home and more remarkably abroad. This was made possible because of his talent and skill, combined with the regionâs structural peculiarities, and the esteem and support he gained from the Royal House. Though born a potter in a rural environment, Manuel Mafra undertook a remarkable professional course, was granted the honorable title of Royal Supplier, saw his production reach the highest levels of acceptance, and acquired to ornament spaces in royal palaces, such as those of Necessidades, Pena and Vila ViÃ§osa. His production was largely exported to foreign countries, and awarded relevant prizes in The Great International Expositions, beginning in 1867 in Paris, and in the succeeding exhibitions. Manuel Mafraâs absorption of foreign aesthetic styles, coexistence with tradition, marked his production, identity and alterity which are still to be fully analysed and substantiated with regard to origins and characterisation, as difficult as irresistible a challenge it may be. Getting to know Mafraâs artwork presupposes the comparative analysis of other ceramic productions which, though far apart in time, converge into a central question, that is the stylistic relationship between the distant work authored by French Renaissance artist, Bernard Palissy, its rebirth in the naturalist/revivalist French and English ceramic in the nineteenth century, together with its acceptance and putting down roots in Portugal by embodying Caldasâ ceramic. This ceramic ware and the acceptance it received raises central question issues, such as the iconography running through it, its inspiration sources, also as the imaginary of a society and its taste, permitting through the observation of its artistic taste the revelation of the nineteenth-century Portuguese elite mentality. A society that before indulging in the quiet and discernible sceneries of Malhoaâs canvas or Rafael Bodalo Pinheiroâs works embodying moving life/still life, falls fascinated by and buys romantic and perturbing artwork authored by a ceramist like Manuel Mafra. Works highly appreciated, but also strongly criticized by Portuguese scholars, such as Joaquim de Vasconcelos a defender of intrinsic values of Portuguese art in <b>industrial</b> products, <b>rejecting</b> perceived imitations of outmoded and foreign models. Mafraâs production, if on the one hand explains the origins of Caldasâ artistic ceramic, on the other hand translates and permits the understanding of the conflict between the implementation of industrialization and the questions arisen by movements and authors pursuing innovative directives of the Arts and Crafts e Aesthetic Movement, claiming for the study of drawing, the use of good design and the application of the arts in the industries that will prevail in the relation manufacture/industry and art at the time, culminating in modernity expressions like Art Nouveau and Art DÃ©co. Caldas da Rainha in the mid nineteenth-century saw {{the emergence}} of a distinctive ceramic ware, intentionally embodied in artistic features, a style clearly marked by decorative elements of flora and fauna applied in high-relief, associated with knowledge and emulation of foreign aesthetic trends, inspired in the Italian majolicas and sixteenth-century neo-Palissy faiences. Manuel Mafra (1831 - 1905) is credited introducing this sui generis style in Caldas, creating an amazing amount of wares with enormous success, both at home and more remarkably abroad. This was made possible because of his talent and skill, combined with the regionâs structural peculiarities, and the esteem and support he gained from the Royal House. Though born a potter in a rural environment, Manuel Mafra undertook a remarkable professional course, was granted the honorable title of Royal Supplier, saw his production reach the highest levels of acceptance, and acquired to ornament spaces in royal palaces, such as those of Necessidades, Pena and Vila ViÃ§osa. His production was largely exported to foreign countries, and awarded relevant prizes in The Great International Expositions, beginning in 1867 in Paris, and in the succeeding exhibitions.

40|$|O Brasil Ã o maior produtor mundial de laranja e de suco de laranja, sendo este setor de grande importÃncia para economia brasileira, responsÃvel por gerar mais de 400 mil empregos e movimentar cifras de bilhÃes de reais por ano. Mas, este setor tambÃm Ã responsÃvel pela produÃÃo de grande quantidade de rejeitos industriais, que equivalem a 50 % do peso da fruta, sendo estes resÃduos utilizados na maioria das vezes como raÃÃo animal. Portanto o uso eficiente destes rejeitos se faz necessÃrio em um mundo em que as reservas naturais vÃm se esgotando. Neste sentido a biocatÃlise mostra-se como uma ferramenta promissora no uso destes resÃduos, que possuem enzimas em sua constituiÃÃo, para obtenÃÃo de produtos de alto valor agregado, as substÃncias enantiopuras. A aplicaÃÃo de diferentes metodologias, prÃticas e de baixo custo, possibilitou a sÃntese de alcoÃis quirais com alto excesso enantiomÃrico (ee) e boas taxas de conversÃo. ReaÃÃes de hidrÃlise e reduÃÃo foram processadas em meio aquoso e, as reaÃÃes de esterificaÃÃo foram {{realizadas}} em solvente orgÃnico, utilizando as casca da laranja como fonte de biocatalisadores. O uso das cascas da laranja como fonte de biocatalisador apresentou resultados bastante promissores, demonstrando capacidade catalÃtica em vÃrias reaÃÃes (reduÃÃo/oxidaÃÃo, hidrÃlise/esterificaÃÃo) atravÃs de metodologias simples e de baixo custo. ConversÃes de 46, 90 - 96, 70 % foram alcanÃadas nas reaÃÃes de biorreduÃÃo acompanhado de ee variando de 21, 15 - 99, 00 %. Nas reaÃÃes de hidrÃlise verificaram-se taxas de conversÃes de 19, 20 - 80, 82 % e ee variando de 9, 60 - 45, 52 %. JÃ nas reaÃÃes de esterificaÃÃo, ee acima de 99 % foram observados e conversÃes maiores que 80 % foram alcanÃadas. Portanto, este estudo abre precedentes para uma ampla faixa de aplicaÃÃo desta fonte de biocatalisador (cascas da laranja), que atualmente Ã considerado como um rejeito industrial, contribuindo sobremaneira para agregar valor a todo um setor produtivo e industrial no qual o Brasil Ã lÃder, a indÃstria de suco de laranja. The Brazil is the producing greater {{of world}} of orange and orange juice, being this sector {{of great importance}} for Brazilian, responsible economy for generating 400 thousand jobs and more than and putting into motion ciphers of billions per year. But, this sector also {{is responsible for the}} production of great amount of industrial rejetcs, that are equivalent 50 % of the weight of the fruit, being these used residues most of the time as animal ration. Therefore the use efficient of these rejetcs if makes necessary in a world where the natural reserves come if depleting. In this direction biocatalysis is presented as a promising tool in the use of these residues, that contains enzymes in its constitution, for attainment of products of high added value, the substances enantiopure. The application of different methodologies, practical and of low cost, made possible the chiral alcohols synthesis with high enantiomeric excess (ee) and good taxes of conversion. Hydrolysis reactions and reduction had been processed in aqueous way e, the reactions of esterification had been carried through in organic solvent, using the rind of the orange as source of biocatalysis for such reactions. The use of the peel of the orange as biocatalysis source presented resulted sufficiently promising, demonstrating catalytic capacity in some reactions (reduction/oxidation, hydrolysis/esterification) through simple methodologies and of low cost. Conversions of 46, 90 - 96, 70 % had been reached in the reactions of bioreduction shown of ee varying of 21, 15 - 99, 00 %. In the hydrolysis reactions taxes of 19, 20 - 80, 82 % conversions and ee had been verified varying of 9, 60 - 45, 52 %. Already in the esterification reactions, ee above of 99 % had been observed and bigger conversions that 80 % had been reached. From there, this study it opens precedents for an ample band of application of this source of biocatalysis (pells of the orange), that currently it is considered as one <b>reject</b> <b>industrial,</b> contributing excessively to add value all a productive and industrial sector in which Brazil is leader, the orange juice industr...|$|R
