5|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the ubiquitin proteasome system, protein degradation in cells was thought to rely mainly on lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles with acidic and protease-filled interiors that can degrade and then recycle exogenous proteins and aged or damaged organelles. However, work by Alfred Goldberg in 1977 on ATP-dependent protein degradation in reticulocytes, which lack lysosomes, suggested the presence of a second intracellular <b>degradation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This was shown in 1978 to be composed of several distinct protein chains, a novelty among proteases at the time. Later work on modification of histones led to the identification of an unexpected covalent modification of the histone protein by a bond between a lysine side chain of the histone and the C-terminal glycine residue of ubiquitin, a protein that had no known function. It was then discovered that a previously identified protein associated with proteolytic degradation, known as ATP-dependent proteolysis factor 1 (APF-1), was the same protein as ubiquitin. The proteolytic activities of this system was isolated as a multi-protein complex originally called the multi-catalytic proteinase complex by Sherwin Wilk and Marion Orlowski. Later, the ATP-dependent proteolytic complex that was responsible for ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation was discovered and was called the 26S proteasome.|$|E

2500|$|A {{commonly}} used synthetic material is PLA - polylactic acid. This is a polyester which degrades within {{the human body}} to form lactic acid, a naturally occurring chemical which is easily removed from the body. Similar materials are polyglycolic acid (PGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL): their <b>degradation</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{is similar to that}} of PLA, but they exhibit respectively a faster and a slower rate of degradation compared to PLA. While these materials have well maintained mechanical strength and structural integrity, they exhibit a hydrophobic nature. [...] This hydrophobicity inhibits their biocompatibility, which makes them less effective for in vivo use as tissue scaffolding. In order to fix the lack of biocompatibility, much research has been done to combine these hydrophobic materials with hydrophilic and more biocompatible hydrogels. While these hydrogels have a superior biocompatibility, they lack the structural integrity of PLA, PCL, and PGA. By combining the two different types of materials, researchers are trying to create a synergistic relationship that produces a more biocompatible tissue scaffolding.|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{oxidation}} processes (AOPs) {{are attractive}} technologies to remove organic compounds in water. AOPs produces highly reactive hydroxyl radicals that can react with organic contaminants and further degrade these compounds with the radical initiated chain reactions. These chain reactions are very complicated and various intermediates and byproducts are produced during the degradation processes. These intermediates and byproducts are {{of great concern}} since they may have adverse effect on human health. So there is {{need to have a}} detailed and quantitative insight into the <b>degradation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and fates of intermediates and byproducts of organic compounds in AOPs. A number of studies have investigated the <b>degradation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of organic compounds in AOPs. However, these studies have the following limitations: first, these studies conduct experiments to determine the <b>degradation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> which are extreme time consuming and prohibitive to be applied for all organic contaminants in water; second, the <b>degradation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that are proposed in these studies contain lumped reactions, which can prevent us from obtaining detailed insight into the degradation process; third, the kinetic models developed in these studies are required to solve ordinary differential equations, which might be too stiff to be solved for complicated <b>degradation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In this study, several computer-based first-principles kinetic models have been developed to overcome the above limitations. These computer-based first-principles kinetic models can automatically predict the <b>degradation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for given parent compounds in aqueous phase AOPs and calculate the concentration profiles of all species involved in the <b>degradation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> To be specific, we developed a computer-based first-principles kinetic model with ODE solver, which can successfully simulate the degradation process for small parent compounds.

Hence, the difficulty of stiffness encountered by traditional ODE based kinetic models can be avoided. This KMC model can successfully simulate the degradation processes of both small and large parent compounds. Last, we developed an on-the-fly KMC model that can have improved computational efficiency as compared with the KMC model.
