5|$|With {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 0.16%, methoxyflurane {{is an extremely}} potent anesthetic agent. It is a powerful analgesic agent at well below full anesthetic concentrations. Because of its low volatility and very <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> point (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), methoxyflurane has a low vapor pressure at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize methoxyflurane using conventional anesthetic vaporizers.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium, {{like most}} metals, has a bright silvery {{appearance}} at first, much like nickel, but it oxidizes {{very quickly to}} a dull gray, although yellow and olive green are also reported. At room temperature plutonium is in its α (alpha) form. This, the most common structural form of the element (allotrope), is about as hard and brittle as gray cast iron unless it is alloyed with other metals to make it soft and ductile. Unlike most metals, {{it is not a}} good conductor of heat or electricity. It has a low melting point (640°C) and an unusually <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> point (3,228°C).|$|E
25|$|Extractive {{distillation}} {{is defined}} as distillation {{in the presence of}} a miscible, <b>high</b> <b>boiling,</b> relatively non-volatile component, the solvent, that forms no azeotrope with the other components in the mixture.|$|E

25|$|<b>High</b> <b>boiling</b> azeotropes, {{such as a}} 20 {{weight percent}} mixture of {{hydrochloric}} acid in water, also exist. As implied by the name, the boiling point of the azeotrope {{is greater than the}} boiling point of either pure component.|$|E
25|$|Uranium {{from the}} blanket salt {{can be removed}} by {{fluorine}} volatility, and transferred to the core salt. To remove the fissile products from the core salt, first the uranium is removed via fluorine volatility. Then the carrier salt can be recovered by high temperature distillation. The fluorides with a <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> point, including the lanthanides stay behind as waste.|$|E
25|$|They used {{fractional}} distillation, which {{separates the}} organic molecule components of petroleum {{based on their}} boiling points. Landa et al. could produce only a few milligrams of adamantane, but noticed its <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> and melting points. Because of the (assumed) similarity of its structure to that of diamond, the new compound was named adamantane.|$|E

25|$|In a kugelrohr a {{short path}} {{distillation}} apparatus is typically used (generally {{in combination with}} a (high) vacuum) to distill <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> (> 300°C) compounds. The apparatus consists of an oven in which the compound to be distilled is placed, a receiving portion which is outside of the oven, and a means of rotating the sample. The vacuum is normally generated by using a high vacuum pump.|$|E
25|$|Because of its <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> {{point and}} {{affinity}} for water, ethylene glycol {{is a useful}} desiccant. Ethylene glycol is widely used to inhibit the formation of natural gas clathrates (hydrates) in long multiphase pipelines that convey natural gas from remote gas fields to a gas processing facility. Ethylene glycol can be recovered from the natural gas and reused as an inhibitor after purification treatment that removes water and inorganic salts.|$|E
25|$|Water {{molecules}} form {{hydrogen bonds}} {{with each other}} and are strongly polar. This polarity allows it to separate ions in salts and strongly bond to other polar substances such as alcohols and acids, thus dissolving them. Its hydrogen bonding causes its many unique properties, such as having a solid form less dense than its liquid form, a relatively <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> point of 100°C for its molar mass, and a high heat capacity.|$|E
50|$|The naphtha {{mixtures}} {{that are}} distilled {{at a lower}} boiling temperature have a higher volatility and, generally speaking, {{a higher degree of}} toxicity than the <b>higher</b> <b>boiling</b> fractions.|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, cycloalkanes {{tend to have}} <b>higher</b> <b>boiling</b> points than their linear {{counterparts}} due to the locked conformations of the molecules, which give a plane of intermolecular contact.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} other cyclic perfluorocarbons, perfluorodecalin can be {{detected}} at extremely low concentrations, making it ideal as a tracer. Its <b>higher</b> <b>boiling</b> makes it suitable for use in water flow.|$|R
25|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, ammonia is less dense than atmosphere, and has approximately 60% of the lifting power of hydrogen or helium. Ammonia {{has sometimes been}} used to fill weather balloons as a lifting gas. Because of its relatively <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> point (compared to helium and hydrogen), ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquefied aboard an airship to reduce lift and add ballast (and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast).|$|E
25|$|Some {{compounds}} {{have very}} <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> points. To boil such compounds, {{it is often}} better to lower the pressure at which such compounds are boiled instead of increasing the temperature. Once the pressure is lowered to the vapor pressure of the compound (at the given temperature), boiling {{and the rest of}} the distillation process can commence. This technique is referred to as vacuum distillation and it is commonly found in the laboratory in the form of the rotary evaporator.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene glycol has {{desirable}} thermal properties, {{including a}} <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> point, low freezing point, stability {{over a wide}} range of temperatures, and high specific heat and thermal conductivity. It also has a low viscosity and, therefore, reduced pumping requirements. Although EGW has more desirable physical properties than PGW, the latter coolant is used in applications where toxicity might be a concern. PGW is generally recognized as safe for use in food or food processing applications, and can also be used in enclosed spaces.|$|E
5000|$|Stable node: This is {{the pure}} {{component}} or the azeotropic point with the <b>highest</b> <b>boiling</b> temperature and lowest vapor pressure in a distillation region. All residue curves end at stable nodes.|$|R
50|$|Development in {{high-performance}} {{aircraft engines}} required improved coolants with <b>higher</b> <b>boiling</b> points, {{leading to the}} adoption of glycol or water-glycol mixtures. These led {{to the adoption of}} glycols for their antifreeze properties.|$|R
5000|$|Oil has a <b>higher</b> <b>boiling</b> point than water, {{so it can}} be used to cool {{items at}} a {{temperature}} of 100 °C or higher. However, pressurised water-cooling may also exceed 100 °C.|$|R
25|$|While water-insoluble {{forms of}} {{plutonium}} such as plutonium dioxide are very {{harmful to the}} lungs, this toxicity is not relevant during a Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA) because plutonium is very involatile and unlikely to leave the reactor in large amounts. Plutonium dioxide has a very <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> point. The toxic effect of the plutonium to the public under these conditions is much {{less than that of}} iodine-131 and caesium. During a loss of cooling accident, the fuel is not subject to such intense mechanical stresses, so the release of radioactivity is controlled by the boiling-point of the different elements present.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} sort of condenser {{consists of}} a single tube wherein {{the heat of the}} vapour is conducted to the glass wall, which is only cooled by air; such air condensers are often used for condensation of <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> liquids (i.e., for distillations at high temperatures, well above 100 °C), where columns can be used with or without packing (see below). Historically, the retort appearing in illustrations of the practice of alchemists is an apparatus that is essentially an unpacked air condenser. Liebig condensers are often used as air condensers, with air circulated rather than a liquid coolant (see next section).|$|E
25|$|Kennecott Copper Mines {{was formed}} in 1910 after a merger of Utah Copper and Kennecott copper mining companies. By 1912, {{environmental}} protection organizations were complaining about high levels of asbestos {{being used in the}} organization. Kennecott Corporation was using asbestos for preventing fires since copper processing requires very high temperatures. Copper has a very <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> point and also requires use of other chemicals to separate it from other metals and impurities present in the ore. Asbestos has microscopic particles that dispersed into the atmosphere and contributed to illnesses among workers and individuals living near the mines. Asbestos is responsible for illnesses such as pleural fibrosis, skin warts and lung cancer.|$|E

25|$|Because of its <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> point, , DMSO evaporates {{slowly at}} normal {{atmospheric}} pressure. Samples dissolved in DMSO cannot be as easily recovered {{compared to other}} solvents, as {{it is very difficult}} to remove all traces of DMSO by conventional rotary evaporation. One technique to fully recover samples is removal of the organic solvent by evaporation followed by addition of water (to dissolve DMSO) and cryodesiccation to remove both DMSO and water. Reactions conducted in DMSO are often diluted with water to precipitate or phase-separate products. The relatively high freezing point of DMSO, , means that at, or just below, room temperature it is a solid, which can limit its utility in some chemical processes (e.g. crystallization with cooling).|$|E
25|$|Low {{pressure}} operation. Because {{the coolant}} salts remain liquid at high temperatures, LFTR cores {{are designed to}} operate at low pressures, like 0.6 MPa (comparable to the pressure in the drinking water system) from the pump and hydrostatic pressure. Even if the core fails, there is little increase in volume. Thus the containment building cannot blow up. LFTR coolant salts are chosen to have very <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> points. Even a several hundred degree heatup during a transient or accident does not cause a meaningful pressure increase. There is no water or hydrogen in the reactor that can cause a large pressure rise or explosion as happened during the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident.|$|E
500|$|Liquid sodium {{is used as}} a heat {{transfer}} fluid in some types of nuclear reactors because it has the high thermal conductivity and low neutron absorption cross section required to achieve a high neutron flux in the reactor. The <b>high</b> <b>boiling</b> point of sodium allows the reactor to operate at ambient (normal) pressure, but the drawbacks include its opacity, which hinders visual maintenance, and its explosive properties. Radioactive sodium-24 may be produced by neutron bombardment during operation, posing a slight radiation hazard; the radioactivity stops within a few days after removal from the reactor. If a reactor needs to be shut down frequently, NaK is used; because NaK is a liquid at room temperature, the coolant does not solidify in the pipes. In this case, the pyrophoricity of potassium requires extra precautions to prevent and detect leaks. [...] Another {{heat transfer}} application is poppet valves in high-performance internal combustion engines; the valve stems are partially filled with sodium and work as a heat pipe to cool the valves.|$|E
50|$|Thus, trans alkenes, {{which are}} less polar and more symmetrical, have lower <b>boiling</b> points and <b>higher</b> melting points, and cis alkenes, which are {{generally}} more polar and less symmetrical, have <b>higher</b> <b>boiling</b> points and lower melting points.|$|R
25|$|The cycloalkanes, {{also known}} as naphthenes, are {{saturated}} hydrocarbons which have one or more carbon rings to which hydrogen atoms are attached according to the formula CnH2n. Cycloalkanes have similar properties to alkanes but have <b>higher</b> <b>boiling</b> points.|$|R
