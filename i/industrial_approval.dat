The project’s assets were frozen in 2015, and some former employees revealed that some parts of the car debuted in 2012 were glued with Velcro and superglue.|$|E
40|$|Recombinant DNA (rDNA) {{technology}} has indeed made tremendous {{breakthrough in the}} discovery of various vaccines or diagnostic antigens. The advent of rDNA technology and its application in the industry has brought about a rapid growth of biotechnology companies {{for the production of}} the rDNA products in human and animal healthcare. The new generation vaccines prepared from the viral/microbial proteins; their fragments or the nucleic acid sequences have been attractive because of their stability, non-infectious nature, homogeneity as well as their cost-effectiveness. Several products are undergoing clinical trials and finally products approval by FDA/FAO/OIE is required before its use in human/animals. Products developed in the field of veterinary prophylactics and diagnostics will be most valuable for further development of rDNA products in the coming decades and advances in biotechnology have also created many legal issues particularly patent. The Biotech industry Guide would be useful for <b>industrial</b> <b>approval,</b> regulatory clearance to rDNA product and biosafety aspects. In view of high market potential for recombinant therapeutics as the case with human therapeutics, indigenous technology should also be developed for the veterinary field to develop a prophylactics and diagnostics. This general article provides collected information regarding production of recombinant proteins and their use in Veterinary science along with brief description of various heterologous expressed systems and their potential applications for the production of recombinant products...|$|E

The NLB relied on enforcement of its orders through the NRA (which only had the power to remove so-called Blue Eagle <b>industrial</b> code <b>approval</b> from a manufacturer) or prosecution by the U.S. Department of Justice. These weak enforcement powers encouraged employer resistance. In July 1933, the Weirton Steel Company held a private election rather than submit to one ran and monitored by the NLB. The Budd Manufacturing Company established a company union, then refused to bargain with the AFL affiliate in the plant.|$|R

40|$|This chapter, {{deals with}} the siting and {{approval}} process for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facility at Wilhelmshaven in the Federal Republic of Germany. The major aspects of the political decision-making process are summarized, focusing {{on the role of}} technical analyses of public safety risk in this decision. The most remarkable feature of this process was that despite the novelty of the LNG technology in the FRG, it deviated very little from established <b>industrial</b> siting and <b>approval</b> procedures. Public interest in the project and concerns about its acceptability did not rise above a relatively low level. At some point, however, unexpected difficulties related to the question of safety risk seemed to threaten the approval of the terminal, but these were eventually overcome by the federal government in a rather elegant way, leaving little more than ripples on the surface...|$|R
40|$|Background Closed-loop {{control of}} type 1 {{diabetes}} is receiving increasing attention due to advancement in glucose sensor and insulin pump technology. Here the function and structure of a class of control algorithms designed to exert control to range, defined as insulin treatment optimizing glycemia within a predefined target range by preventing extreme glucose fluctuations, are studied. Methods The main contribution of the article is definition of a modular architecture for control to range. Emphasis is on system specifications rather than algorithmic realization. The key system architecture elements are two interacting modules: range correction module, which assesses the risk for incipient hyper- or hypoglycemia and adjusts insulin rate accordingly, and safety supervision module, which assesses the risk for hypoglycemia and attenuates or discontinues insulin delivery when necessary. The novel engineering concept of range correction module is that algorithm action is relative to a nominal open-loop strategy—a predefined combination of basal rate and boluses believed to be optimal under nominal conditions. Results A proof of concept of the feasibility of our control-to-range strategy is illustrated by using a prototypal implementation tested in silico on patient use cases. These functional and architectural distinctions provide several advantages, including (i) significant insulin delivery corrections are only made if relevant risks are detected; (ii) drawbacks of integral action are avoided, e. g., undershoots with consequent hypoglycemic risks; (iii) a simple linear model is sufficient and complex algorithmic constraints are replaced by safety supervision; and (iv) the nominal profile provides straightforward individualization for each patient. Conclusions We believe that the modular control-to-range system is the best approach to incremental development, regulatory <b>approval,</b> <b>industrial</b> deployment, and clinical acceptance of closed-loop control for diabetes...|$|R
