40|$|The. use of high-chromium {{cast irons}} for {{abrasive}} wear resistance is restricted {{due to their}} poor fracture toughness properties. An. {{attempt was made to}} improve the fracture characteristics by altering the distribution, size and. shape of the <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbide</b> phase without sacrificing their excellent wear resistance. This was achieved by additions of molybdenum or tungsten followed by high temperature heat treatments. The absence of these alloying elements or replacement of them with vanadium or manganese did not show any significant effect and the continuous <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbide</b> morphology remained the same after application of high temperature heat treatments. The fracture characteristics of the alloys with these metallurgical variables were evaluated for both sharp-cracks and blunt notches. The results were used in conjunction with metallographic and fractographic observations to establish possible failure mechanisms. The fracture mechanism of the austenitic alloys was found to be controlled not only by the volume percent but was also greatly influenced by the size and distribution of the eutectic carbides. On the other hand, the fracture mechanism of martensitic alloys was independent of the <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbide</b> morphology. The uniformity of the secondary carbide precipitation during hardening heat treatments was shown to be a reason for consistant fracture toughness results being obtained with this series of alloys although their <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbide</b> morphologies were different. The collected data were applied to a model which incorporated the microstructural parameters and correlated them with the experimentally obtained valid stress intensity factors. The stress intensity coefficients of different short-bar fracture toughness test specimens were evaluated from analytical and experimental compliance studies. The. validity and applicability of this non-standard testing technique for determination of the fracture toughness of high-chromium cast irons were investigated. The results obtained correlated well with the valid results obtained from standard fracture toughness tests...|$|E

Vanadium addition promoted the precipitation of carbides both in ferrite grains and at its grain boundaries. Pearlite was found to form near the cell boundary next to the eutectic carbides in the as-cast chromium alloyed specimens, and was fully decomposed by an annealing heat treatment. Vanadium addition {{led to the formation}} of fine precipitates, prohibiting the ferrite growth, resulting in smaller ferrite grains. The precipitate phase at grain boundaries in vanadium alloyed specimens was identified as vanadium carbide (VC 1 -x) and the stoichiometry of the <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbide</b> was almost same as that in Si-Mo ferritic ductile cast iron except for a higher vanadium content.

The plane strain fracture toughness K-Ic and the fracture strength were measured for each alloy. X-ray mapping was used to identify the phases on the fracture surfaces.

It was found that most fracture occurred in the <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbides,</b> but that for the alloys with a reduced volume fraction of <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbides,</b> a small amount of crack propagation occurred in the austenitic dendrites. This change in crack path correlated with an increase in fracture toughness. The Ritchie-Knott-Rice model of brittle fracture was applied.

Microstructure of heat-resistant ferritic ductile iron consists of ferrite, <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbide</b> at eutectic cell boundaries, precipitated carbide in grain and graphite. Pearlite was found around <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbide</b> in some specimens, however, all pearlite was decomposed by the annealing treatment. As Si content was increased, the number and size of carbide decreased and full ferrite matrix were obtained. The starting temperature of ferrite-austenite transformation and the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} increased with the increase of Si content. The growth of Si 6. 0 wt % specimen during held at 1, 000 o C is lower than other specimens, and it is considered {{that in the case of}} Si 6. 0 wt % specimen, the carbon movement is restrained due to the low solubility of carbon in matrix. In the case of annealed specimens, the contraction during ferrite-austenite transformation was not found when heating.

In the as-cast condition, the sample with relatively lower carbon and silicon contents has an austenite-martensite matrix and is much harder than the sample with relatively higher carbon and silicon contents having more <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbides</b> in a bainite matrix.

40|$|ABSTRACT: High-chromium {{white cast}} iron {{contains}} chromium carbides that provide excellent wear resistance, but also cause poor fracture properties. Heat treatments are applied {{in an attempt to}} decrease the angularity of the <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbides</b> and to improve the toughness of the matrix by intentionally creating a high fraction of retained austenite, while minimizing the formation of secondary carbides. It is found that the austenitising temperature hardly affects the carbide morphology. However a large effect is found on the shape and size of the secondary carbides formed and on the relative fractions of austenite and martensite. Measurements are performed with an instrumented drop-weight impact tower on Charpy-like specimens containing electric-discharge-machined notches. Results show that austenitising at high temperature (1100 °C) leads to a significantly larger total fracture energy compared to the as-cast condition. However, the energy absorbed at crack initiation and the KIc value seem not to be affected. SEM observations of the fracture surfaces clearly indicate that the crack propagates along the interfaces of or through the <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbides.</b> A ductile fracture appearance is found around secondary carbides...|$|R

Such a tribological behavior is mainly due {{to the presence of}} carbides especially those obtained during the solidification route and that are known as primary or <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbides.</b> It may therefore be interesting to determine the relative stability of primary carbides when considering thermal and thermomechanical treatments performed at a temperature high enough to allow either the homogenization of the matrix or the occurrence of a desired grain size. This thermal stage is often required to produce tailored microstructures that can lead to improved mechanical properties. In this work a series of thermal treatments performed on samples originated form casting foundry parts were done. Raw materials are both HSS and semi-HSS grades used in application where wear resistance is needed. Thermo- Calc® (TC) simulations and Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) were performed to determine the crystallization behavior and the subsequent solid state transformations of the studied alloys respectively in equilibrium and in non equilibrium conditions. Light and Scanning Electron Microscopies were done together with hardness measurements in order to enhance metallurgical features of the heat treated samples.

It appears from microstructural analyses and carbides quantification that Mo-rich <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbides</b> undergo in situ phase transformations during heat treatments. In fact Mo-rich M 2 C carbides transform themselves into MC, M 6 C and M 3 C, through a so-called budding phenomenon.

The tribological properties were examined for the base cast iron (W), for the cast iron subjected to spheroidising treatment (S) and for the abrasion-resistant steel (SH). Studies have shown that high-vanadium cast iron with both <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbides</b> and spheroidal carbides has the abrasion resistance twice as high as the abrasion-resistant cast steel. The spheroidisation of VC carbides did not change the abrasion resistance compared to the base high-vanadium grade...|$|R
5000|$|High-chromium {{white iron}} alloys allow massive {{castings}} (for example, a 10-tonne impeller) to be sand cast, as the chromium reduces cooling rate {{required to produce}} carbides through the greater thicknesses of material. Chromium also produces carbides with impressive abrasion resistance. These high-chromium alloys attribute their superior hardness {{to the presence of}} chromium carbides. The main form of these <b>carbides</b> are the <b>eutectic</b> or primary M7C3 carbides, where [...] "M" [...] represents iron or chromium and can vary depending on the alloy's composition. The <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbides</b> form as bundles of hollow hexagonal rods and grow perpendicular to the hexagonal basal plane. The hardness of these carbides are within the range of 1500-1800HV ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The present {{work has}} {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} calcium on the microstructure and properties of AISI M 2 high speed steels. The {{results show that the}} as-cast structure consists of the iron matrix and networks of M 2 C <b>eutectic</b> <b>carbides,</b> which are greatly refined in the ingot modified by calcium. Meanwhile, the morphology of M 2 C evolves from the plate-like shape into the fibrous one. Compared with the plate-like M 2 C, the fibrous M 2 C is less stable at high temperatures, which promotes the spheroidization and refinement of carbides. Therefore, M 2 steels modified by calcium obtain higher hardness and red-hardness after heat treatment than those without the addition of calcium...|$|R
