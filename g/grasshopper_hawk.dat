5|$|Until {{the sixth}} {{edition of the}} AOU Checklist of North American Birds was {{published}} by the American Ornithologists' Union in 1983, {{the most commonly used}} name for the American kestrel was the sparrow hawk or sparrowhawk. This was due to a mistaken connection with the Eurasian sparrowhawk in the genus Accipiter. The sixth edition of the AOU Checklist corrected this, officially renaming the bird American kestrel. Several other colloquial names for the kestrel are also in use, including <b>grasshopper</b> <b>hawk,</b> due to its diet, and killy hawk, due to its distinct call.|$|E
25|$|Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsoni), {{is a large}} Buteo hawk of the Falconiformes, {{sometimes}} {{separated in}} the Accipitriformes like its relatives. This species was named after William Swainson, a British naturalist. It is colloquially known as the <b>grasshopper</b> <b>hawk</b> or locust hawk, as it is very fond of Acrididae (locusts and grasshoppers) and will voraciously eat these insects whenever they are available.|$|E

5000|$|Its {{mandate is}} to {{conserve}} habitats for birds and wildlife {{primarily in the}} southern half of the British Columbia Interior, a region of at least 489,000 km2 with habitats ranging from [...] "moist coniferous forests to desert". Ducks Unlimited Canada describes the area as [...] "a landscape of varyings elevation and climate {{that has resulted in}} a tremendous diversity of habitat types, including desert, grasslands, shrub-steppe, riparian, wetlands, dry and moist coniferous forests, and alpine tundra". It supports 1.6 million breeding waterfowl of at least 26 species throughout the 20,000 km2 of lakes and wetlands in the region, and at least 373 bird species overall, including the entire population of eleven provincially endangered species: Brewer's sparrow (subspecies breweri), burrowing owl, ferruginous <b>hawk,</b> <b>grasshopper</b> sparrow, lark sparrow, prairie falcon, sage thrasher, Swainson's hawk, white-headed woodpecker, Williamson's sapsucker, and yellow-breasted chat.|$|R
60|$|Again, {{the most}} ludicrous or infamous tales may be current about the adventures and misadventures of the <b>grasshopper</b> or the <b>hawk.</b> He may be, as mythically conceived, {{only one out}} of a crowd of similar {{magnified}} non-natural men or lower animals. But neither his companions nor his legend are likely to distract the thoughts of the Bushman who cries to Cagn for food, or of the Murri who tells his boy that Pund-jel watches him from the heavens, or of the Solomon Islander who appeals to Qat as he crosses the line of reefs and foam. Thus it may be maintained that whenever man turns to a guardian not of this world, not present to the senses, man is for the moment a theist, and often a monotheist. But when we look from aspiration to doctrine, from the solitary ejaculation to ritual, from religion to myth, it would probably be vain to suppose that an uncontaminated belief in one God only, the maker and creator of all things, has generally prevailed, either in America or elsewhere. Such a belief, rejecting all minor deities, consciously stated in terms and declared in ritual, is the result of long ages and efforts of the highest thought, or, if once and again the intuition of Deity has flashed on some lonely shepherd or sage like an inspiration, his creed has usually been at war with the popular opinions of men, and has, except in Islam, won its disciples from the learned and refined. America seems no exception to so general a rule.|$|R
