40|$|We {{study the}} {{behaviour}} of cubic blue phases under shear flow via lattice Boltzmann simulations. We {{focus on the}} two experi-mentally observed phases, Blue Phase I (BPI) and Blue Phase II (BPII). The disclination network of Blue Phase II continuously breaks and reforms under steady shear, leading to an oscillatory stress response in time. For larger shear rates, the structure breaks up into a <b>Grandjean</b> <b>texture</b> with a cholesteric helix lying along the flow gradient direction. Blue Phase I leads to a very different response. Here, oscillations are only possible for intermediate shear rates – very slow flow causes a transition of the initially ordered structure into an amorphous network with an apparent yield stress. Larger shear rates lead to another amorphous state with different structure of the defect network. For even larger flow rates the same break-up into a <b>Grandjean</b> <b>texture</b> as for Blue Phase II is observed. At the highest imposed flow rates both cubic blue phases adopt a flow-aligned nematic state. Our results provide the first theoretical investigation of sheared blue phases in large systems, and are relevant to understanding the bulk rheology of these materials. ...|$|E

Chiral nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{prepared with}} <b>Grandjean</b> <b>texture</b> demonstrate a photonic bandgap whose central wavelength {{is proportional to}} the pitch length, P, of the liquid crystal and whose width is given by (ne – no) P. We show that methyl red doped chiral nematics undergo a shift in the photonic bandgap upon photo-isomerization. This shift is a result of (1) photo-induced change in anchoring energy on the nematic surface, and (2) change in the natural pitch length from the photo-isomerization of the azo dye...|$|E

Numerous cholesteric copoly(ester-imide) s were {{prepared}} from tert. -butylhydro-quinone and isosorbide, {{on the one}} hand, and from the acid chlorides of N-(4 -carboxyphenyl) trimellitimide and 1, 6 -bis(4 -carboxyphenoxy) hexane on the other. Two polycondensation methods were applied and compared. The molar ratio of the diols was varied and also the molar ratio of hot dicarboxylic acid chlorides.

40|$|Study of {{a diverse}} set of chiral smectic materials, {{each of which}} has twist grain {{boundary}} (TGB) phases over a broad temperature range and exhibits grid patterns in the <b>Grandjean</b> <b>textures</b> of the TGB helix, shows that these features arise from a common structure: “giant” smectic blocks of planar layers of thickness lb > 200 nm terminated by GBs that are sharp, mediating large angular jumps in layer orientation between blocks (60 ° < Δ < 90 °), and lubricating the thermal contraction of the smectic layers within the blocks. This phenomenology is well described by basic theoretical models applicable in the limit that the ratio of molecular tilt penetration length-to-layer coherence length is large, and featuring GBs in which smectic ordering is weak, approaching thin, melted (nematic-like) walls.

40|$|Characteristics of {{a liquid}} crystal system, {{comprised}} of a shear-sensitive cholesteric-monomer liquid crystal thin-film coated on a liquid-crystal polymer substrate, are described. The system provides stable <b>Grandjean</b> <b>texture,</b> a desirable feature for shear-stress measurements using selective reflection from the monomer liquid-crystal helix structure. Impingement of gas or air flow on the monomer liquid-crystal free surface changes the wavelength of the selective reflection for an incident white light from red toward blue with {{increase in the}} rate of gas flow. The contrast of the selectively reflected light improves considerably by providing a thin black coating of about 5 microns at the monomer-polymer interface. The coating thickness is such that the steric interactions are still sufficiently strong to maintain <b>Grandjean</b> <b>texture.</b> For a small angle of incidence of a monochromatic light, the measurement of the reflected light intensity normal to the monomer-polymer liquid-crystal interface enables the determination of the wavelength for selective reflection {{as a function of the}} gas-flow differential pressure applied in the plane of the interface. The variation of the wavelength with the pressure is linear with a slope of about 2 nm/mmHg. Furthermore, the shear-stress effects are reversible unlike for monomer liquid crystal-metal systems used for flow visualization on wind-tunnel model surfaces. The present system offers a suitable method for direct on-line measurement of shear stress field from measurements of the wavelength for selective reflection for an incident white light...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOptical {{properties}} of an asymmetric Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity interferometer {{made up of}} a conventional metallic mirror and a polymer stabilized cholesteric liquid crystal (PSCLC) Bragg mirror have been investigated. The first FP cavity design comprises a gold mirror, an isotropic layer made up of the polymer glue, a quarter wave plate to convert the input linearly polarized modes into the circularly polarized modes inside the cavity, and the PSCLC Bragg mirror, all sandwiched between two indium tin oxide glass plates. The second FP cavity has a layer of conducting polymer deposited on the quarter-wave plate to apply the electric field only to the cholesteric stack. To have reflectivity above 95 % in visible range we implement 30 layers of cholesteric liquid crystal in a planar <b>Grandjean</b> <b>texture.</b> The device compactness and the mirror parallelism due to the monolithic fabrication of FP are advantageous from the technical point of view.

40|$|A novel {{amphiphilic}} chitosan derivative, acryloyl chitosan (AcCs), was synthesized by {{a homogeneous}} reaction of chitosan and acryloyl chloride using methanesulfonic acid as solvent and catalyst. The concentrated solutions of AcCs/acrylic acid were investigated by polarized optical microscopy (POM) and found demonstrate cholesteric mesophase above the critical concentration of 45 wt%. AcCs/polyacrylic acid (PAA) composite films were prepared via the photopolymerization of 52 wt% AcCs/acrylic acid solution, and subsequently the permanganic etching technique {{was employed to}} expose the textures and defects inside the composite films. The <b>Grandjean</b> planar <b>textures</b> were observed by POM, {{but a series of}} dark and bright striation lines, which were attributed to the periodic structure of the cholesteric helix, were detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The disclination pairs, tau(-) lambda(+) and tau(+) lambda(-), were found, however lambda(+) lambda(-) and tau(+) tau(-) were absent. Effect of etching time on morphology of AcCs/PAA composite films was also investigated, comparing with 30 wt% free-acetyl chitosan (CS) /PAA composite films. The results showed that AcCs/PAA composite films had better anticorrosion ability than (CS) /PAA composite films, due to the crosslinking network between AcCs and PAA. FTIR confirmed that double bonds of AcCs involved in photo-solidification. Therefore the system studied takes the advantage of easy controlling for permanganic etching.

40|$|This report {{documents}} a {{study of}} the use of liquid crystals to visualize boundary layer development on a turbomachine blade. A turbine blade model in a linear cascade of blades was used for the tests involved. Details of the boundary layer development on the suction surface of the turbine blade model were known from previous research. Temperature sensitive and shear sensitive liquid crystals were tried as visual agents. The temperature sensitive crystals were very effective in their ability to display the location of boundary layer flow separation and reattachment. Visualization of natural transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer flow with the temperature sensitive crystals was possible but subtle. The visualization of separated flow reattachment with the shear sensitive crystals was easily accomplished when the crystals were allowed to make a transition from the focal-conic to a <b>Grandjean</b> <b>texture.</b> Visualization of flow reattachment based on the selective reflection properties of shear sensitive crystals was achieved only marginally because of the larger surface shear stress and shear stress gradient levels required for more dramatic color differences...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{applications}} of liquid crystals in three areas of aerodynamic testing, namely temperature, shear stress and pressure measurement over surfaces. The {{use of the}} selective reflection colours from encapsulated chiral nematic materials to map surface temperatures is assessed. This method is very successful {{in a wide range}} of applications for determining heat transfer rates, but has limitations where high heat transfer rates are present, due to the thermal response time of the material structure, and the effects of temperature gradients. The thermal time constant is determined as a function of material viscosity. It is typically 10 ms for a chiral nematic material at room temperature. The effect of a temperature gradient on the selective reflection is studied in terms of the pitch gradient produced in the material structure. Two improved methods are then proposed. The first makes use of the cholesteric to isotropic transition to indicate an isotherm on a heated surface, while the second uses changes in the birefringence colours produced by an aligned nematic layer applied to a surface and viewed between crossed poiarisers. Changes in the selective reflection colours from cholesteric liquid crystals can be used to assess surface shear stress levels. This method is assessed and determined to be too problematical for accurate measurements. A new method is proposed, based on the shear induced texture change from the focal-conic to the <b>Grandjean</b> <b>texture</b> in the cholesteric phase. This method may be used to quantify surface shear stress levels as well as to provide excellent flow visualisation once flow alignment has occurred. Tests have been conducted on the pressure sensitivity of chiral nematic liquid crystal materials. The results indicate that the change in transition temperature with pressure is of the order of 40 °/kbar. which may not be sensitive enough for wind tunnel purposes. </p...|$|E

The electric field causes the optic axis, which is coinciding with the helix axis of the hardtwisted cholesteric (pitch The effect has been examined in its static as well as dynamic aspects. A general expression, describing the field-dependence of the tilt, containing the individual splay and bend flexoelectric coefficients and the three Oseen elastic constants was derived for the case of. DELTA [...] epsilon. = 0. It predicts a striking range of linearity of the induced tilt and furthermore that this tilt is temperature independent as long as the helical wave vector of the material is constant. In certain mixtures with. DELTA [...] epsilon. = 0 we have in fact reached induced tilt angles of more than 30 degrees without deviation from linearity. Moreover, a tilt angle of 22. 5 degrees is enough for providing 100 % light modulation. Several constant pitch cholesteric materials were investigated and our results confirm that the induced tilt of the optic axis is practically independent of temperature, which is a very attractive feature for applications. Moreover, the dynamics of the effect was studied. The electrooptic response is relatively fast, with response times of the order of 10. my. s to 100. my. s for the studied materials. We were also able to detect the immediate change in the flexoelectric coefficient due to a configurational change in the molecule, induced by light. We discuss the influence on the flexoelectrooptic effect of material parameters such as the flexoelectric coefficients, the elastic constants, and the dielectric anisotropy. The dielectric effect gives a non-linear contribution to the electrooptic response and we conclude that the dielectric anisotropy must be very close to zero {{in order to get a}} large linear response. The fittings and simulations based on the analysis conform very well with our experimental findings. So far, neither molecular materials nor alignment methods have been optimized for the flexoelectrooptic effect. The special uniform lying structure, of crucial importance for the effect, has a tendency to transform into <b>Grandjean</b> <b>texture.</b> We have solved this problem by creating a stabilizing polymeric network in the volume of the cell by means of photopolymerization of a small amount of reactive monomer added to the cholesteric. At the same time as proposing a simple method for measuring sign and magnitude of flexocoefficients, we finally point out the inconsistency of data reported so far regarding these coefficients in general and propose a standard convention of sign which hopefully will find international acceptance...|$|E
