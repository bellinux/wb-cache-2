He often belittled the profession, for {{instance}} saying to Kanin, [...] "Why do actors think they're so God damn important? They're not. Acting is not an important job <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> Plumbing is." [...] Tracy was humble about his abilities, telling a journalist, [...] "it's just that I try no tricks. No profile. No 'great lover' act... I just project myself as I am—plain, trying to be honest." [...] He was known to have enjoyed the quip once made by Alfred Lunt: [...] "The art of acting is—learn your lines!" [...] Katharine Hepburn, in an interview six years after Tracy's death, suggested that Tracy wished he had held a different profession.|$|E

"There was a National Park out there, but I can't {{remember}} {{exactly where it}} was [...] [...] [...] at least, it wasn't of substantial significance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> The thing that was significant was {{that we had to}} double the output of power in this state in ten years in order [...] supply the demands of industry and the community.

2500|$|Hegel's {{thinking}} can {{be understood}} as a constructive development within the broad tradition that includes Plato and Immanuel Kant. To this list one could add Proclus, Meister Eckhart, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Plotinus, Jakob Böhme, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. What all these thinkers share, which distinguishes them from materialists like Epicurus and Thomas Hobbes, and from empiricists like David Hume, is that they regard freedom or self-determination both as real and as having important ontological implications, for soul or mind or divinity. This focus on freedom is what generates Plato's notion (in the Phaedo, Republic, and Timaeus) of the soul as having a higher or fuller kind of reality than inanimate objects possess. While Aristotle criticizes Plato's [...] "Forms," [...] he preserves Plato's cornerstones of the ontological implications for self-determination: ethical reasoning, the soul's pinnacle in the hierarchy of nature, the order of the cosmos, and an assumption with reasoned arguments for a prime mover. Kant imports Plato's high esteem of individual sovereignty to his considerations of moral and noumenal freedom, as well as to God. All three find common ground on the unique position of humans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> known by the discussed categorical differences from animals and inanimate objects.|$|E

2500|$|Film critic Emanuel Levy {{gave the}} film an [...] "A" [...] and wrote, [...] "Alongside Joel and Ethan Coen's No Country for Old Men, {{which is a}} Western in disguise, or rather a modern Western, Assassination of Jesse James is the second {{masterpiece}} of the season." [...] Levy also wrote, [...] "Like Bonnie & Clyde, Dominik's seminal Western is a brilliant, poetic saga of America's legendary criminal as well as meditative deconstruction of our culture's most persistent issues: link of crime and fame, myths of heroism and obsession with celebrity." [...] Lewis Beale of Film Journal International said [...] "Impeccably shot, cast and directed, this is a truly impressive film from sophomore writer-director Andrew Dominik... but suffers from an unfortunate case of elephantiasis." [...] Beale said Affleck is [...] "outstanding in a breakout performance" [...] and said Pitt is [...] "scary and charismatic." [...] Beale wrote, [...] "The director seems {{so in love with}} his languorous pacing, he's incapable of cutting the five or ten seconds in any number of scenes that could have given the film a more manageable running time. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> however, this amounts to little more than a quibble." [...] Beale said that ultimately, the film is [...] "a fascinating, literary-based work that succeeds as both art and genre film." ...|$|E
