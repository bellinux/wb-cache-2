40|$|The {{expansion}} of the ethanol industry in Brazil faces two important challenges: to reduce total ethanol production costs and to limit the greenhouse gas (<b>GHG)</b> emission <b>intensity</b> of the ethanol produced. The objective {{of this study is}} to economically optimize the scale and location of ethanol production plants given the expected {{expansion of}} biomass supply regions. A linear optimization model is utilized to determine the optimal location and scale of sugarcane and eucalyptus industrial processing plants given the projected spatial distribution of the expansion of biomass production in the state of Goiás between 2012 and 2030. Three expansion approaches evaluated the impact on ethanol production costs of expanding an existing industry in one time step (one-step), or multiple time steps (multi-step), or constructing a newly emerging ethanol industry in Goiás (greenfield). In addition, the <b>GHG</b> emission <b>intensity</b> of the optimized ethanol supply chains are calculated. Under the three expansion approaches, the total ethanol production costs of sugarcane ethanol decrease from 894 US$/m 3 ethanol in 2015 to 752, 715, and 710 US$/m 3 ethanol in 2030 for the multi-step, one step and greenfield expansion respectively. For eucalyptus, ethanol production costs decrease from 635 US$/m 3 in 2015 to 560 and 543 US$/m 3 in 2030 for the multi-step and one-step approach. A general trend is the use of large scale industrial processing plants, especially towards 2030 due to increased biomass supply. We conclude that a system-wide optimization as a marginal impact on overall production costs. Utilizing all the predefined sugarcane and eucalyptus supply regions up to 2030, the results showed that on average the <b>GHG</b> emission <b>intensity</b> of sugarcane cultivation and processing is - 80 kg CO 2 /m 3, while eucalyptus <b>GHG</b> emission <b>intensity</b> is 1290 kg CO 2 /m 3. This is due to the high proportion of forest land that is expected to be converted to eucalyptus plantations.

Extensive cattle production systems reduced their <b>GHG</b> emission <b>intensity</b> by an estimated - 4. 11 tCO 2 e per 1000 l of milk (- 60 %), while intensive production systems reduced their intensity by an estimated - 1. 7 tCO 2 e/ 1000 l (- 47 %). The decrease in <b>GHG</b> emission <b>intensity</b> is evidence that RDCP made the value chain more efficient and sustainable in climate change mitigation terms.  RDCP’s productivity-oriented interventions increased livestock herd size and cow weight. As a consequence, total annual GHG emissions in the project area increased by an estimated 18, 980 tCO 2 e due to increased herd size and 34, 904 tCO 2 e due to increased cow weight, when compared to business-as-usual practices. This represents a 12 percent increase in GHG emissions.  The increase in milk output was proportionally much larger than the associated increase in GHG emissions.

40|$|In Korea, 97 % of {{the energy}} {{resources}} are imported. The growth rate of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission per capita in the country was {{the highest in the}} world during 1990 and 2004. Moreover, 83 % of the domestic GHG emissions stemmed from energy use in the year 2004. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an econometric model for energy <b>intensity</b> and <b>GHG</b> emission <b>intensity</b> in view of the poor energy endowment and environmental situation in Korea. In this study, a 96 Â xÂ  96 hybrid energy input-output (E-IO) table was constructed by using energy units for each energy sector from the 2000 Korean IO table developed by the Bank of Korea in 2003. By using this E-IO table, the amount of energy <b>intensities</b> and <b>GHG</b> emission <b>intensities,</b> caused by energy use, were estimated for each sector. It was revealed that in the case of direct energy use, the average values of the direct energy <b>intensity</b> and <b>GHG</b> emission <b>intensity</b> of 96 economic sectors were 0. 186 ton of oil equivalent (TOE) /million Korean Won (M-KRW) and 0. 315 Â t-CO 2 -eq. /M-KRW, respectively.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from IOP Publishing via the DOI in this record. Biofuels are {{increasingly}} promoted worldwide as a means for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport. However, current regulatory frameworks and most academic life cycle analyses adopt a deterministic approach in determining the GHG intensities of biofuels and thus ignore the inherent risk associated with biofuel production. This study aims to develop a transparent stochastic method for evaluating UK biofuels that determines both the magnitude and uncertainty of <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity</b> on the basis of current industry practices. Using wheat ethanol as a case study, we show that the <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity</b> could span a range of 40 - 110 gCO 2 e MJ- 1 when land use change (LUC) emissions and various sources of uncertainty are taken into account, as compared with a regulatory default value of 44 gCO 2 e MJ- 1. This suggests that the current deterministic regulatory framework underestimates wheat ethanol <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity</b> and thus may not be effective in evaluating transport fuels. Uncertainties in determining the <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity</b> of UK wheat ethanol include limitations of available data at a localized scale, and significant scientific uncertainty of parameters such as soil N 2 O and LUC emissions.

Nevertheless, significant disagreement and controversies exist regarding the actual benefits of biofuels displacing fossil fuels, as shown by {{a large number of}} life-cycle studies that have varying and sometimes contradictory conclusions. This article presents a comprehensive review of life-cycle studies of biodiesel in Europe. Studies have been compared in terms of nonrenewable primary energy requirement and <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity</b> of biodiesel. Recently published studies negate the definite and deterministic advantages for biodiesel presented in former studies. A high variability of results, particularly for biodiesel <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity,</b> with emissions ranging from 15 to 170 gCO 2 eq MJf- 1 has been observed. A detailed assessment of relevant aspects, including major assumptions, modeling choices and results, has been performed. The main causes for this high variability have been investigated, with emphasis on modeling choices. Key issues found are treatment of co-product and land use modeling, including high uncertainty associated with N 2 O and carbon emissions from cultivated soil. Furthermore, a direct correlation between how soil emissions were modeled and increasing values for calculated GHG emission has been found. A robust biodiesel life-cycle modeling has been implemented and the main sources of uncertainty have been investigated to show how uncertainty can be addressed to improve the transparency and reliability of results.

40|$|Many jurisdictions are {{implementing}} {{policies to}} reduce the greenhouse gas (<b>GHG)</b> <b>intensity</b> of transportation. These programs, which intend to force or encourage substitution of low-carbon fuels for fossil fuels, fall into two broad categories. First, GHG-intensity programs, like the California low carbon fuel standard (LCFS), oblige fuel sellers {{to ensure that the}} average <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity</b> (as measured by each fuel’s global warming index, or GWI) of their annual sales does not surpass a legal limit.

40|$|Households are {{expected}} to play {{a pivotal role in}} reducing the UK’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the UK Government is encouraging specific household actions to help meet its targets. However, due to there bound effect, only a portion of the GHG emission reductions estimated by simple engineering calculations are generally achieved in practice. For example, replacing short car journeys by walking or cycling reduces consumption of motorfuels. But this frees up money that may be spent on, for example, purchasing extra clothes or flying on vacation. Alternatively, the money may be put into savings. Since all of these options lead to GHG emissions, total GHG savings may be less than anticipated. Indeed, in some instances, emissions may increase — a phenomenon known as ‘backfire’. We estimate that there bound effect for a combination of three abatement actions by UK households is approximately 34 %. Targeting re-spending on goods and services with a low <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity</b> reduces this to a minimum of around 12 %, while re-spending on goods and services with a high <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity</b> leads to backfire.

40|$|Demand for {{reductions}} in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is leading automakers to develop {{various types of}} low-emission vehicles, including electric vehicles and efficient combustion vehicles. Although electric vehicles avoid tailpipe GHG emissions, their use results in only small net life-cycle benefits in countries where electricity generation is GHG intensive. In the near future, this benefit might reduce to a net cost as automakers aim to achieve strict vehicle emission targets for combustion vehicles. Demand for {{reductions in}} GHG emissions is, however, also driving some shift towards low-GHG electricity generation such that the net emissions of electric vehicles would decrease.

Therefore, to maintain the net life-cycle GHG emissions benefits of EVs, EV automakers may still include some GHG-intensive processes and components during manufacture, but they should plan to improve or replace such processes and components.

Agriculture accounts for approximately 11 % of China’s national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with cereal production representing a large proportion (about 32 %) of agricultural emissions. Minimizing emissions per unit of product is a policy objective and we estimated the <b>GHG</b> <b>intensities</b> (GHGI) of rice, wheat and maize production in China from 1985 to 2010. Results show significant variations of GHGIs among Chinese provinces and regions. Relative to wheat and maize, GHGI of rice production is much higher owing to CH 4 emissions, and is more closely related to yield levels. In general, the south and central has been the most carbon intensive region in rice production while the GHGI of wheat production is highest in north and northwest provinces. The southwest has been characterized by the highest maize GHGI but the lowest rice GHGI. Compared to the baseline scenario, a 2 % annual reduction in N inputs, combined with improved water management in rice paddies, would mitigate 17 % of total GHG emissions from cereal production in 2020 while sustaining the required yield increase to ensure food security.

The particular challenge this places on agriculture is to identify practices which ensure stable and productive food supply that also have a low greenhouse gas (<b>GHG)</b> <b>intensity.</b> Maize is the principle staple crop in many parts of Africa with low and variable yields, averaging only 1. 6  t/ha in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Food security and increasing crop yields are considered priorities in SSA over impacts of food production on GHG emissions. Here we describe an approach that can be used to inform a decision support tree for optimal interventions to obtain sufficient food production with low <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity,</b> and we demonstrate its applicability to SSA. We employed a derivative of the farm greenhouse gas calculator ‘Cool Farm Tool’ (CFT) on a large survey of Kenyan and Ethiopian smallholder maize-based systems in an assessment of <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity.</b> It was observed that GHG emissions are strongly correlated with nitrogen (N) input. Based on the relationship between yield and GHG emissions established in this study, a yield of 0. 7  t/ha incurs the same emissions as those incurred for maize from newly exploited land for maize in the region. Thus, yields of at least 0. 7  t/ha should be ensured to achieve GHG intensities lower than those for exploiting new land for production. Depending on family size, the maize yield required to support the average consumption of maize per household in these regions was determined to be between 0. 3 and 2. 0  t/ha, so that the desirable yield can be even higher from a food security perspective. Based on the response of the observed yield to increasing N application levels, average optimum N input levels were determined as 60 and 120  kg N/ha for Kenya and Ethiopia, respectively. Nitrogen balance calculations could be applied to other countries or scaled down to districts to quantify the trade-offs, and to optimise crop productivity and GHG emissions...|$|E

Transitioning the World’s energy economy to a lower carbon future will require significant investment in a variety of cleaner technologies, including renewables and nuclear power. In the short term, improving the efficiency of fossil fuel combustion in energy generation can provide an important contribution. Availability of life cycle <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity</b> data will allow decision-makers to move away from overly simplistic assertions about the relative merits of certain fuels, and focus on the complete picture, especially the critical roles of technology selection and application of best practice. This analysis compares the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) intensities per megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity produced for a range of Australian and other energy sources, including coal, conventional liquefied natural gas (LNG), coal seam gas LNG, nuclear and renewables, for the Australian export market. When Australian fossil fuels are exported to China, life cycle greenhouse gas emission intensity in electricity production depends to a significant degree on the technology used in combustion. LNG in general is less GHG intensive than black coal, but the gap is smaller for gas combusted in open cycle gas turbine plant (OCGT) and for LNG derived from coal seam gas (CSG). On average, conventional LNG burned in a conventional OCGT plant is approximately 38 % less GHG intensive over its life cycle than black coal burned in a sub-critical plant, per MWh of electricity produced. However, if OCGT LNG combustion is compared to the most efficient new ultra-supercritical coal power, the <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity</b> gap narrows considerably. Coal seam gas LNG is approximately 13 – 20 % more GHG intensive across its life cycle, on a like-for like basis, than conventional LNG. Upstream fugitive emissions from CSG (assuming best practice gas extraction techniques) do not materially alter the life cycle <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity</b> rankings, such is the dominance of end-use combustion, but application of the most recent estimates of the 20 -year global warming potential (GWP) increases the contribution of fugitives considerably if best practice fugitives management is not assumed. However, if methane leakage approaches the elevated levels recently reported in some US gas fields (circa 4 % of gas production) and assuming a 20 -year methane GWP, the <b>GHG</b> <b>intensity</b> of CSG-LNG {{generation is}} on a par with sub-critical coal-fired generation. The importance of applying best practice to fugitives management in Australia’s emerging natural gas industry is evident. When exported to China for electricity production, LNG was found to be 22 – 36 times more GHG intensive than wind and concentrated solar thermal (CST) power and 13 – 21 times more GHG intensive than nuclear power which, even in the post-Fukushima world, continues to be a key option for global GHG reduction...|$|E
30|$|This study {{develops}} a bottom-up model for NGV fleets in China and conducts an LCA {{with a combination}} of real-time fuel economy data, actual vehicle population data and a life-cycle inventory database from the TLCAM specified for the context of China. A comparative study on the direct energy consumption, life-cycle energy use, direct CAP emissions and life-cycle <b>GHG</b> emissions <b>intensity</b> of NGVs and comparable traditional fuel vehicles in China is conducted. Based on this analysis, the comprehensive effects of replacing traditional petroleum fuel powered vehicles with NGVs in China, including the petroleum substitution benefit, CAP reduction benefit and GHG reduction benefit, are investigated.|$|R
30|$|Electricity {{generation}} {{is central to}} the analysis of home heating-related GHG emissions because it is the source of energy for operating heat pumps. When an ASHP is used in a home that normally uses electric heating, less electricity will be used. This guarantees that less energy is consumed and fewer GHGs are emitted. In a home that uses natural gas or oil for heating, we need to first consider the energy and <b>GHG</b> emission <b>intensity</b> of the fuels burned in those furnaces. Then we must compare that to the electricity used by an ASHP, considering how this new electricity demand is met.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the potential climate change mitigation impact of the project entitled Agricultural Development and Value Chain Enhancement Activity II (ADVANCE II) in Ghana shows that an approximate reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 100 % will be possible. When project targets are achieved, ADVANCE II will transform the project area from a low net source of GHG emissions to roughly carbon neutrality. *  ADVANCE II is estimated to achieve moderate GHG mitigation benefits that are driven by soil management improvements (- 9, 223 tCO 2 e/yr), crop residue burning reductions (- 4, 249 tCO 2 e/yr), and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) of irrigated rice (- 858 tCO 2 e/yr).  The moderate increase in fertilizer and pesticide use supported by the project leads to small increases in GHG emissions (1, 244 tCO 2 e/yr and 2, 514 tCO 2 e/yr respectively).  ADVANCE II provides important benefits for low emission development (LED) by significantly reducing the crop <b>GHG</b> emission <b>intensity</b> (<b>GHG</b> emissions per unit of production). This is achieved mainly through strong growth in agricultural productivity and reductions in postharvest losses...|$|R
