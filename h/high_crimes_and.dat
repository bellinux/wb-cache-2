5|$|To {{sequester}} Clayton {{from the}} {{affairs in the}} state, the Brindles and the Democrats decided {{the only thing they}} could do was elect him to the US Senate. However, even though he won unanimously, he refused to take his seat, which would mean letting Johnson become governor. In 1871, the state House of Representatives drafted articles of impeachment against Clayton, charging him {{with a wide variety of}} impeachable actions, including depriving Johnson and several other state officials of offices to which they had been fairly elected, removing state officials and judges from offices to which they had been fairly elected, aiding in fraudulent elections, taking bribes for state railroad bonds, and various other <b>high</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>and</b> misdemeanors. The members of the House then tried to suspend Clayton from his duties as governor by force. They even apparently tried locking him in his office and nailing the door shut. However, Clayton responded that they had no right by the state constitution to deprive him of his office. At the same time, the House also brought impeachment charges against Chief Justice John McClure for his part in trying to deny Johnson the privileges of his office of lieutenant governor.|$|E

[...] The House of Representatives has the sole power of impeaching, while the United States Senate has the sole power to try all impeachments.

James Madison argued that impeachment should only be for criminal behavior, arguing that a maladministration standard would effectively mean that the President would serve at the pleasure of the Senate.

2500|$|On 4 April 1786, Burke {{presented}} the Commons with the Article of Charge of <b>High</b> <b>Crimes</b> <b>and</b> Misdemeanors against Hastings. The impeachment in Westminster Hall, {{which did not}} begin until 14 February 1788, would be the [...] "first major public discursive event {{of its kind in}} England", bringing the morality and duty of imperialism to the forefront of public perception. Burke already was known for his eloquent rhetorical skills and his involvement in the trial only enhanced its popularity and significance. Burke's indictment, fuelled by emotional indignation, branded Hastings a 'captain-general of iniquity'; who never dined without 'creating a famine'; whose heart was 'gangrened to the core', and who resembled both a 'spider of Hell' and a 'ravenous vulture devouring the carcasses of the dead'. The House of Commons eventually impeached Hastings, but subsequently, the House of Lords acquitted him of all charges.|$|E
2500|$|The Constitution {{concentrates}} removal {{powers in}} the Congress by empowering and obligating the House of Representatives to impeach both executive and judicial officials for [...] "Treason, Bribery, or other <b>high</b> <b>Crimes</b> <b>and</b> Misdemeanors." [...] Impeachment is a formal accusation of unlawful activity by a civil officer or government official. The Senate is constitutionally empowered and obligated to try all impeachments. A simple majority in the House is required to impeach an official; however, a two-thirds majority in the Senate is required for conviction. A convicted official is automatically removed from office; in addition, the Senate may stipulate that the defendant be banned from holding office in the future. Impeachment proceedings may not inflict more than this; however, a convicted party may face criminal penalties in a normal court of law. In {{the history of the}} United States, the House of Representatives has impeached sixteen officials, of whom seven were convicted. Another resigned before the Senate could complete the trial. Only two presidents have ever been impeached: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999. Both trials ended in acquittal; in Johnson's case, the Senate fell one vote short of the two-thirds majority required for conviction. In 1974, Richard Nixon resigned from office after impeachment proceedings in the House Judiciary Committee indicated he would eventually be removed from office.|$|E

2500|$|Boutwell {{opposed the}} Reconstruction {{policies}} of President Andrew Johnson {{from the first}} weeks of his administration. Arguing that any remaking of the former Confederate governments must begin with steps to open the electorate to blacks as well as whites, he warned that black rights and loyal Unionists' safety could be protected in no other way. In time, he turned {{into one of the}} most militant advocates of Johnson's impeachment, and by far the most respected of them. Unlike his colleagues, a hostile observer wrote, he brought to the cause [...] "the advantage of a cultivated mind, an extensive reading and a scholarly acquaintance with all of history that could be mustered into such a service." [...] In December 1867, he made the case for impeaching the president without charging him with having committed actual crimes— contending, in effect, that impeachment was a political, and not just a judicial process. (He did not expect impeachment to pass and did not foresee the Senate convicting Johnson; what he hoped for, instead, was a statement on the House's part that the president had committed <b>high</b> <b>crimes</b> <b>and</b> misdemeanors, in effect a resolution of censure). The House did not agree, but two months later, in February 1868, Johnson's removal of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton (in contravention of a law drafted by Stanton and Boutwell requiring Senate confirmation of such acts) united Republicans behind a resolution of impeachment. [...] Boutwell chaired the committee that drafted the articles of impeachment, and presented them to the House for debate. He was chosen as one of the managers of the impeachment proceedings that followed.|$|E
