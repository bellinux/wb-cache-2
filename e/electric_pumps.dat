5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses <b>electric</b> <b>pumps.</b> A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was formed}} by {{the construction of a}} dam and provided water to the pumping station which originally contained four Woolf compound rotative beam pumping engines, built by Glenfield & Kennedy of Kilmarnock, which have now been replaced by <b>electric</b> <b>pumps.</b> Two of the steam engines have been preserved, with one in working order as part of the visitor centre which also includes educational facilities for children. The pumping station is now a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|Water {{is pumped}} {{to the summit}} at {{the western end of}} the locks, from Wilton Water, by the {{restored}} Crofton Pumping Station. The original steam-powered pumping station is preserved and contains one of the oldest operational Watt-style beam engines in the world, dating from 1812. The steam engines still pump water on selected weekends, but for day-to-day operation <b>electric</b> <b>pumps</b> are used, automatically controlled by the water level in the summit pound.|$|E

5|$|Little {{attempt was}} made during the 17th and 18th centuries to pump water, {{possibly}} because the coal-driven Newcomen steam engines would have been uneconomical. It is unclear why windmills were not employed, as {{they were on the}} Fens of East Anglia, but only two examples have been recorded on the Levels: one at Bleadon {{at the mouth of the}} River Axe, where a sea wall had been built, and the other at Common Moor north of Glastonbury, which was being drained following a private Act of Parliament in 1721. The first steam pumping station was Westonzoyland Pumping Station in 1830, followed by more effective ones from 1860. Automatic <b>electric</b> <b>pumps</b> are used today.|$|E
5|$|Three {{independent}} {{hydraulic systems}} are {{installed on the}} 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using <b>electric</b> <b>pumps.</b> A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. A basic form of fly-by-wire facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft's electronics bay.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales and Repulse {{were the}} first capital ships to be sunk solely by naval air power on the open sea (albeit by {{land-based}} rather than carrier-based aircraft), a harbinger of the diminishing role this class of ships was to play in naval warfare thereafter. It is often pointed out, however, that contributing factors to the sinking of Prince of Wales were her surface-scanning radars being inoperable, depriving Force Z {{of one of its}} most potent early-warning devices and the critical early damage she sustained from the first torpedo. Another factor which led to Prince of Waless demise was the loss of dynamos, depriving Prince of Wales of many of her <b>electric</b> <b>pumps.</b> Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in total darkness, and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding.|$|E
50|$|An <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> was {{the last}} to be {{installed}} on the site, in 1937. A Crompton Parkinson <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> motor drove the 18inch (0.45m) diameter Gwynnes centrifugal <b>pump</b> 114 hp <b>electric</b> motor that can be seen at the river end of its dedicated room. Its purpose was to cope with the ever increasing storm surges from the new housing estates.|$|R

50|$|There was a {{water tower}} at Henley to provide steam engine water, {{and for many}} years it had been powered by steam from a {{locomotive}} given that duty. In 1950 an <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> system was installed, but on regatta days a steam engine was stationed there to pump water as the many visiting engines all requiring water overwhelmed {{the capacity of the}} <b>electric</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R
25|$|In July 2009, {{the modern}} <b>electric</b> <b>pumps</b> at Crofton failed. While {{awaiting}} repair, British Waterways contacted the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust who put Crofton into steam.|$|E
25|$|For day-to-day operation, the {{pumping station}} now uses <b>electric</b> <b>pumps,</b> {{automatically}} {{controlled by the}} water level in the summit pound. However the original steam driven pumping equipment has been preserved and is still operational. A single operable Galloway boiler provides steam to the engines.|$|E
25|$|Some pubs {{disguise}} keg beer {{by having}} an imitation pump {{handle on the}} bar. If the bar staff have merely turned on a tap, or are just resting their hand on a very small handle with no pump action, then this is a keg beer. Exceptions are some pubs (in the north and occasionally elsewhere) which use <b>electric</b> <b>pumps</b> or the pubs in Scotland that use traditional air-pressure founts on cask ale.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, {{the first}} <b>electric</b> <b>pumping</b> station was installed, and several more {{were built in}} the {{following}} years. Heavy rainfall in July 1968 indicated that the district was still at risk from flooding, and several more <b>electric</b> <b>pumping</b> stations were commissioned. More than half of the district now relies on pumping for its flood protection, although most stations still have a gravity outfall, to cope with breakdowns or power failures.|$|R

25|$|In 1903 the 1846 {{engine was}} rebuilt {{as a simple}} {{single-acting}} engine and thus became the current number 2 engine. Both engines then continued in regular use until the 1950s, when {{the state of the}} chimney forced the removal of the top 36 feet (11 m). The reduced height chimney was unable to provide sufficient draught for the boiler, and it proved cheaper to retire the steam engines and install <b>electric</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|E
25|$|More recently, the {{organisational}} structure has changed. Henry VIII's Statute of Sewers, dating from 1531, was {{swept away by}} the Land Drainage Act 1930, and responsibility passed through six bodies, ending with the Environment Agency in 1995. Local drainage channels were managed by an internal drainage board, and again responsibility has changed as the three IDBs managing the area have gradually merged. Steam pumping was replaced by diesel, and subsequently by <b>electric</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{system was}} {{operated}} {{as a commercial}} enterprise until 1925, after which the business and its assets reverted to the City of Melbourne, as specified by the original act. One of the early improvements made by the City Council was to consolidate the system. The steam pumps were replaced by new <b>electric</b> <b>pumps,</b> located in the Spencer Street power station, which thus supplied both electric power and hydraulic power to the city. The hydraulic system continued to operate under municipal ownership until December 1967.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{drainage}} ditches {{that are now}} evident were constructed {{under the authority of}} an Act of Parliament obtained in 1801. The plans for the scheme were drawn up by the civil engineer John Rennie. Better drainage was achieved from the 1860s, with the building of steam pumping stations. The steam engines were later replaced by diesel engines, and now many of them use <b>electric</b> <b>pumps.</b> Sensitive restoration of some of the pumping stations in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in the Witham Fourth District IDB being given a Design Award.|$|E
25|$|Apple {{farming in}} the area started to decline about the time Ihmsen Ranch fruit {{production}} was at its prime. Water rates shot up with a switch to <b>electric</b> <b>pumps.</b> World War I took owners and workers away with the draft. During the Great Depression many families left the mostly agricultural area looking for work. Washington and British Columbia apple growers were able to cut prices because they shipped their produce by river transportation, whereas Apple Valley apples were transported by rail or by truck. The death knell {{was a series of}} outbreaks of a virulent fungus infections coupled with frost, heat and hail in 1944, 1945 and 1946.|$|E
25|$|MV Okanagan {{was built}} in 1946 by West Coast Ltd. Shipbuilders. It was all welded steel with a diesel engine, and had 800 horsepower. The vessel was {{designed}} and built at Vancouver, then broken into pieces and shipped to the Okanagan Landing shipyard to be reassembled. It was 110ft. long, 24ft. wide, 12ft. 6 in. deep, and had a draft of 10ft. The Okanagan had an eight-cylinder diesel engine and <b>electric</b> <b>pumps.</b> The engine had two Vivian backups, which were generators {{that were used to}} prestart the engine, preheat oil, provide electricity, and fill the air compressor tanks. Everything except for the hull, engine, and motors was made in British Columbia.|$|E
40|$|AbstractUsually {{in order}} to balance the load demand at high peak hours, hydro <b>electric</b> <b>pumped</b> storage power plant is utilized. In this project a novel design, (CFPID) Cascaded Fuzzy PID (Proportional - Integral - Derivative) {{controller}} scheme using B&R (Bernecker & Rainer) Industrial Automation PLC - HMI (Programmable Logic Control - Human Machine Interface) for Efficient Energy management and storage in real time performance of a hydro <b>electric</b> <b>pumped</b> storage power plant is proposed. In this scheme, Fuzzy Level is cascaded with PID Flow for improvement in performance. A prototype model of a hydro <b>electric</b> <b>pumped</b> storage power plant with 22 digital inputs and 14 potential free outputs is fabricated with an objective of controlling the process variables, flow and level is done by using conventional PLC and the proposed CFPID control. There are two tanks in the prototype, lower tank with 2 stages of level and upper tank with 5 stages of level. HMI is used to monitor and operate the process in online - real time, for easy control of the operations. In this paper, the proposed PLC- HMI automation based CFPID control scheme is performed and finally compared with the conventional PLC by experimental results and validated by using real time statistics obtained from the hydro <b>electric</b> <b>pumped</b> storage power plant...|$|R

25|$|The Wendover Arm Canal {{is part of}} the Grand Union Canal in England, {{and forms}} part of the British canal system. It was planned as a feeder to carry water from springs near the town of Wendover in Buckinghamshire to the main line of the Grand Junction Canal at Bulbourne near Star Top End in Hertfordshire, but when it opened in 1799 it was navigable, as the extra cost of making it so was small. Water {{supplies}} from Wendover were found to be inadequate, and a series of reservoirs were built. A pumping station at Whitehouses was superseded by the Tringford pumping station in 1817; its steam engines were replaced by diesel engines in 1911 and then by <b>electric</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|E
25|$|Floodwater {{is removed}} {{from many of the}} moors of the Somerset Levels by pumping stations, which were {{originally}} steam-powered. These were superseded by diesel engines, and more recently by <b>electric</b> <b>pumps.</b> The King's Sedgemoor Drain is unusual in that it operates entirely by gravity. Consideration was given to replacing Dunball clyse with a pumping station in 2002, which would have allowed water to be discharged into the estuary at all states of the tide, but this course of action was not followed. Management of the Drain {{is the responsibility of the}} Environment Agency, whereas the numerous rhynes or drainage ditches which feed into the Drain are the responsibility of several internal drainage boards, who work together as the Parrett Consortium of Drainage Boards.|$|E
25|$|Very tall {{buildings}} ("skyscrapers"), when built using modern lightweight materials, might sway uncomfortably (but not dangerously) in certain wind conditions. A {{solution to this}} problem is to include at some upper story a large mass, constrained, but free to move within a limited range, and moving on some sort of bearing system such as an air cushion or hydraulic film. Hydraulic pistons, powered by <b>electric</b> <b>pumps</b> and accumulators, are actively driven to counter the wind forces and natural resonances. These may also, if properly designed, be effective in controlling excessive motion – with or without applied power – in an earthquake. In general, though, modern steel frame high rise buildings are not as subject to dangerous motion as are medium rise (eight to ten story) buildings, as the resonant period of a tall and massive building is longer than the approximately one second shocks applied by an earthquake.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternative}} to a water timer to administer precise amounts of water at a regular basis, is to precisely calculate the needed waterflow and arrange a system composed by a Time switch and an <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> that. The <b>electric</b> <b>pump</b> is to be arranged to be turned on and off at regular intervals by the time switch to administer (fairly) precise and regular water quantities. This approach, used frequently in DIY watering systems, allows financial savings as the water timer can be discarded. For high-end applications however, water timers sometimes allow more flexibility and more options.|$|R
