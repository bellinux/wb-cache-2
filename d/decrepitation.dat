50|$|For {{metamorphic}} rocks, {{there are}} certain principles for measuring the decrepitations. What is known as D1 <b>decrepitation,</b> is classified as a temperature range of about 200-300℃, and {{is caused by the}} liquid phase which occupies intricate inclusions, as in hydrothermal minerals. D2 <b>decrepitation</b> is characterized by a starting heat range of about 300-700℃, the temperature can also increase rapidly for a few hundred degrees, such as in solid inclusions. D3 <b>decrepitation</b> is continuously heated until the rate reaches its maximum out at about 350-450℃, D3 <b>decrepitation</b> can be observed in carbonates and is defined by the effect of an inversion of the mineral. Once <b>decrepitation</b> of a D4 mineral is reached it should reach completion within a few degrees, which is seen in the <b>decrepitation</b> of quartz. <b>Decrepitation</b> as a result of decomposition is known as D5 <b>decrepitation,</b> it is characterized by a sharp upwards rate, a definite peak, and a sharp downwards rate, this can be detected by comparing the peaks of various minerals within a rock.|$|E

50|$|The {{pressure}} {{necessary to}} spur <b>decrepitation</b> is reliant upon {{the size of}} the fluid inclusions; bigger inclusions decrepitate more easily at pressures between 700-900 atmospheres, while smaller fluid inclusions may require upwards of 1200 atmospheres, contrastingly, when fluid inclusions become even smaller, the amount of pressure applied will have no effect and <b>decrepitation</b> will not occur.|$|E

The thermal-vacuum impulse method was selected {{to be used for}} such a study within the thermal range of 25  400 °C. It was confirmed that this method is also suitable for carbonate minerals with a medium <b>decrepitation</b> activity, e. g. magnesite with a fast transition from a non-impulse degasification to the impulse one.

40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the pressures of}} <b>decrepitation</b> of vesicles in synthetic glasses of feldspar compositions (NaAlSi 308 -KAlSi 308). Vesicles filled with Xe do not decrepitate at internal pressures of 160 MPa, indicating that the unflawed surface of the vesicle wall has an intrinsic strength > 80 MPa. Vesicles containing C 02 escaped <b>decrepitation</b> and displayed ductile deformation when the Tg was reached at the maximum P of 200 MPa (indicating an intrinsic strength higher than 100 MPa). Vesicles containing H 20 showed dramatically reduced strength, decrepitating at internal pressures {{on the order of}} 1 - 5 MPa. The H 20 -filled vesicles leaked slowly over periods of several weeks or months. The relative stability of the inclusions is strongly dependent on the quench rate, with rapidly quenched inclusions showing greater stability over long periods of time. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of radial microfractures in the walls of H 20 -filled vesicles. We account for the microfracturing with reference to recent studies of chemical-gradient stress. Our observations may account for a variety of phenomena, which occur wherever hydrous vesicular glasses are formed, including explosive decompression of vesicular glassy rock in near-surface volcanic environments, spontaneous <b>decrepitation</b> of vesicular basaltic glass dredged from the seafloor ("popping rocks"), and rapid loss of H 20 from synthetic vesicular glasses produced in laboratory experiments investigating fluid-melt phase equilibria...|$|E

High hydrogen absorption, large <b>decrepitation</b> and low cost make these hydrides better catalysts for large-scale production of CNTs.

Interestingly, different types of carbon nanostructures have been observed at these two different growth temperatures. At 850 °C, Ni-encapsulated MWNB were obtained, while at 950 °C, Ni-encapsulated MWNT could be observed. These carbon nanostructures have been characterized using SEM, TEM and HRTEM.|$|E

This pioneering study aimed to amply investigate this lump ore's particle disintegration. One ton of ore from the mine was homogenized and quartered. Representative samples were characterized by different techniques, such as ICP-AES, XRD, SEM, BET and OM. Aiming to characterize particle disintegration, three parameters were proposed: Cold Disintegration Index (CDI), <b>Decrepitation</b> Index (DI) and Heating Disintegration Index (HDI). By using these indexes, it was possible to conclude that this manganese lump ore did not present significant disintegration at room temperature.

Euhedral quartz formed during early fissure opening from an immiscible fluid mixture composed of a low salinity aqueous solution and a CH 4 -rich vapour phase, at temperatures of about 110 – 1208 C and pressures ranging from 15 to 56 MPa.

Fluid inclusions of known isotopic and elemental ratios have been synthesized in quartz {{to serve as}} control samples. With these standards, two previously used fluid extraction procedures for bulk quartz samples have been evaluated and improved: crushing in a mortar followed by leaching and thermal <b>decrepitation</b> followed by leaching. Our experiments on quartz show that 87 Sr/ 8 hSr analysis is straightforward using both methods, regardless of the leaching solution employed. However, analysis of accurate “Rb/&Sr ratios is not trivial. Leaching with pure water is only 93 % efficient and yields elevated ratios owing to failure to inhibit surface adsorption of Sr. Leaching with a La”+-doped acid solution solves this problem; it is 99. 7 % efficient and yields accurate ratios. Crushing is the only fluid liberation method which delivers the correct 87 Rb/X 6 Sr values. In contrast, thermal decrepit&ion yields 87 Rb/ 86 Sr ratios which are quite reproducible, but exclusively incor-rect. If inert sample containers are used, falsely elevated ratios are obtained at all <b>decrepitation</b> temperatures due to three concurrent extraction artefacts.

The inclusions were trapped {{under conditions of}} immiscibility during partial melting of the enclaves. Trapped fluids in Bt-Grt-Sil and Spl-Crd enclaves have been characterized by microthermometric. Raman spectroscopic, electron microprobe (EMP) and transmission electron microprobe (TEM) analyses to better constrain melt and fluid products and pressure conditions of the partial melting event. In Bt-Grt-Sil enclaves, Fl are one phase and contain a CO(2) -N(2) mixture, sometimes with graphite as trapped phase. In Spl-Crd enclaves, Fl are two phase and contain an H(2) O-rich (<= 90 mol%), with minor amounts of CO(2), N(2), and traces of H(2) S and CH(4). Graphite often occurs as a trapped phase in the H(2) O-rich Fl, and rare carbonates and other accessory minerals are also observed. Although <b>decrepitation</b> features are not recognized during examination with a petrographic microscope, Fl densities based on mass balance constraints are always lower than expected at the inferred PT conditions of entrapment, 5 - 7 kbar and 800 - 900 degrees C. Extremely low densities (approximate to 0. 1 g cm(- 1)) of Fl in Bt-Grt-Sil enclaves suggest a pressure <= 500 bar at 800 - 900 degrees C, while densities up to 0. 53 g cm(- 1) in Spl-Crd enclaves indicate P kbar at 800 - 900 degrees C. Re-equilibration {{is likely to have}} occurred via partial <b>decrepitation,</b> as suggested by TEM studies that show rare partially annealed sub-pm cracks, containing small cavities, which may have been the pathways for fluid movement out of the inclusions.

The composition of the fluid phase coexisting with melt in Bt-Grt-Sil enclaves cannot be evaluated owing to the almost complete <b>decrepitation</b> and fluid loss from Fl, and may only be inferred to have been more CO(2) -rich, based on the lower H(2) O content of the coexisting melt...|$|E
40|$|Nanogranites {{represent}} totally crystallized inclusions of anatectic melt trapped within peritectic minerals of migmatites and granulites. They {{have recently}} been discovered in several locations. This discovery opens new possibilities for investigating crustal melting processes, provided that an appropriate method for retrieving the information contained within nanogranite inclusions is available. Here, we describe a series of remelting experiments that have been performed at different temperatures and under dry, and H 2 O-added, conditions on nanogranite inclusions hosted in migmatitic garnet, using a piston-cylinder apparatus. The glasses obtained by quenching the sample from temperature that approaches the trapping temperature have compositions {{very similar to those}} of preserved glassy inclusions coexisting with nanogranites in the same cluster. No significant differences in H 2 O contents were observed for nanogranites rehomogenized under dry and wet conditions. Higher (50 – 100 °C) experimental temperatures resulted in dissolution of the host into the melt and inclusion <b>decrepitation</b> with the loss of volatiles. Therefore, piston-cylinder remelting experiments may eliminate inclusion <b>decrepitation,</b> maintaining the primary fluid contents in the originally trapped melt. These volatiles would otherwise be lost during remelting experiments at ambient pressure. By preventing volatile loss, the inclusion {{does not have to be}} overheated to achieve homogenization, and the compositions of quenched glasses so obtained can be assumed to be those of melts produced (and trapped as inclusions) during crustal anatexis.

Study of Marmarosh Diamonds {{collected from the}} nappes in the Ukrainian part of the Carpathians howed that these quartz crystals contain abundant primary syngenetic methane-rich and aqueous inclusions. Many of the early inclusions how evidence of "explosion " (<b>decrepitation</b> u der conditions of internal overpressure), caused by tectonic uplift of the enclosing sediments during Miocene times. Regional mapping of morphologic and microthermometric characteristics of inclusions indicates that the decrepitated inclusions display characteristic textural features and homogenization temperature patterns within the different nappes, suggesting that the various nappes have experienced significantly different burial-uplift histories. Thus, inclusions reveal an increase in depth of burial from the inner regions of the Folded Flysch Carpathians towards the outer regions: about 2 km for the Marmarosh nappe, 5 km for the Rahiv nappe, 7 km for the Porculec and Chornogora nappes and 10 km for the Krosno zone. The corresponding average geothermal gradients decreased from about 40 - 45 °C/km for the Mannarosh nappe to about 20 - 25 °C/km the Krosno zone. It is also concluded that the Marmarosh nappe followed a P-T path close to the original inclusion isochore, because inclusions from quartz crystals collected within this nappe show no evidence of <b>decrepitation.</b> On the other hand, inclusions in quartz from the Krosno zone show very intense xplosion features and the highest fluid densities that have been recorded for the region, suggesting that the Krosno zone was the most buried part of the Ukrainian Folded Carpathians during formation of the inclusions. 1...|$|E

These occurrences, extremely rare for anatectic crustal rocks, have been studied by microthermometry, micro-Raman spectroscopy and EMP analysis. Both at El Hoyazo and Mazarron the immiscible FI and MI are hosted in plagioclase and cordierite, with microstructures that suggest primary trapping. The FI hosted in cordierite are monophase, whereas they may contain crystals of calcite when hosted in plagioclase, indicating fluid-host reaction during cooling. <b>Decrepitation</b> microstructures have not been observed. The MI contain fresh glass of peraluminous, felsic rhyolitic composition, typical of anatectic S-type melts. In all samples the fluids are CO(2) -dominated (> 85 mol%), with minor amounts of N(2) and CH(4), and traces of CO and H(2). The nucleation of graphite, induced by the laser beam in some inclusions, demonstrates that the fluids are graphite-saturated. Large scatter in microthermometric behaviour of FI indicates significant density variations. Only in one sample from El Hoyazo are fluid densities compatible with the estimated P-T conditions of trapping (5 - 7 kbar, 850 +/- 50 degrees C), whereas in the remaining samples the extremely low densities, suggesting trapping pressures < 1 kbar, are {{in contrast with the}} microstructural indications of primary entrapment and little evidence of <b>decrepitation.</b> In addition, although some measured compositions are compatible with C-O-H-N fluid speciation at the estimated P-T conditions of anatexis, the lack of H(2) O in all FI is inconsistent with the slightly hydrated character of coexisting glasses. The possible mechanisms accounting for departure of densities and compositions of FI from expected values are discussed, and leakage of H(2) O suggested as the most plausible. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.

These include thermohydrogen processing (THP) and forming of refractory alloys, processing of rare earth-transition metal magnets by hydrogen <b>decrepitation</b> (HD) and hydrogenation–decomposition–desorption–recombination (HDDR), hydrogen-induced amorphization (HIA) and microstructural refinement, extraction of elements from ores and alloys, {{and the use of}} hydrogen as a reducing gas for welding and brazing. Hydrogen is found to enhance the formability, microstructure and properties of a large variety of materials, including steels, Ti-based alloys and metal matrix composites (MMCs), refractory metals and alloys, rare earth-transition metal alloys, metalloid-containing metallic glasses, etc...|$|E
40|$|Magnesite {{is a basic}} {{carbonate}} material used as caustic magnesia in agriculture and industry and as raw material {{for the production of}} sintered magnesia. As a basic refractory material, the magnesite is mainly used for high-temperature aggregates in the mining and processing industry. In the mechanical and heat treatment of magnesite due to <b>decrepitation</b> of magnesite, a number of fine grained and dust particles are formed. Currently, only part of the material is processed. This paper presents new opportunities for improving the capture process of dust wastes (flue dust). The solution is focused on application to the rotary kilns (RP). The proposed solution allows a significant contribution to the capture and subsequent treatment of the flue dust. Thus, partially implemented adjustments create the possibility of effective recovery of this type of waste...|$|E
