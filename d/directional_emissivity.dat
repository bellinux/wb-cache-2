5000|$|The {{emissivity}} {{of a given}} {{surface is}} the measure {{of its ability to}} emit radiation energy in comparison to a blackbody at the same temperature. The emissivity of a surface varies between zero and one. The emissivity of a real surface varies {{as a function of the}} surface temperature, the wavelength, and the direction of the emitted radiation. The fundamental emissivity of a surface at a given temperature is the spectral <b>directional</b> <b>emissivity,</b> which is defined as the ratio of the intensity of radiation emitted by the surface at a specified wavelength and direction to that emitted by a blackbody under the same conditions. [...] The total <b>directional</b> <b>emissivity</b> is defined in the same fashion by using the total intensities integrated over all wavelengths. In practice, a more convenient method is used: hemispherical properties. These properties are spectrally and directionally averaged. The emissivity of a surface at a specified wavelength may vary as temperature changes since the spectral distribution of emitted radiation changes with temperature. Finally the total hemispherical emissivity is defined in terms of the radiation energy emitted over all wavelengths in all directions. Radiation is a complex phenomenon. The dependability of its properties in wavelength and direction makes it even more complicated. Therefore, the gray and diffuse approximation methods are commonly used to perform radiation calculations. A gray surface is characterized by having properties independent of wavelength, and a diffuse surface has properties independent of direction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{roughness}} on the <b>directional</b> spectral <b>emissivity</b> {{as well as}} the directional and hemispherical total emissivities was systematically studied for the precious metals silver, gold, palladium, platinum, rhodium, and iridium in order to avoid or minimise the effect of oxidation and other chemical reactions. The microtopography of these surfaces, which were mechanically treated by rolling, turning, grinding, lapping, and polishing, and subjected to an appropriate thermal treatment to remove crystal structure defects caused by roughening, was characterised by roughness measurements yielding roughness profiles and their statistical characteristics such as roughness height, roughness transfer length, and average slope of surface elements. The emis-sivities were measured by radiometric techniques in the wavelength range 2. 5 mm to 51 mm and in the angular range 08 to 758 at a temperature of 150 8 C. The results of the emissivity and roughness measurements are discussed within the scope of the existing theories for the emissivity of rough surfaces. It was found that roughnesses with heights smaller than a fraction 0. 01 of the wavelength can still affect the radiative properties of the surface. However, the emissivity does not monotoni-cally increase with the roughness height but rather correlates with the slope of parts of the surface profile. For the same metal with different surface finish, the <b>directional</b> total <b>emissivity</b> was observed to vary by at most a factor of 20. These changes are much larger than those caused by structural defects due to roughening and should be attributed to the surface topography. ...|$|R

A clear trend was identified for the ratio of the 0. 6 – 2. 8 μm to the 0. 6 – 40 μm hemispherical emissivity (assumed to be close to the true α/ε ratio, which is the ratio of the solar absorptivity α to the total emissivity ε) {{as a function of the}} RMS roughness. This ratio is decreasing with increasing RMS roughness rapidly up to around 1 μm and then tends to stabilize for higher roughness. It suggests that increasing the roughness, starting from a flat surface, will progressively give more weight to the long wavelength range emissivities in comparison to the short wavelength ones. Beside the RMS roughness, a sharp surface structure on a finer scale found on some samples also led to an additional decrease of the α/ε ratio, but these structures are not stable at high temperature and disappear due to a natural high temperature smoothing. Finally our results also show that the α/ε ratio of rhenium is lower than the one of tungsten...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—one of the {{significant}} factors for improving the accuracy of Land Surface Temperature (LST) retrieval is the correct understanding of the directional anisotropy for thermal radiance. In this paper, the multiple scattering effect between heterogeneous non-isothermal surfaces is described rigorously according {{to the concept of}} configuration factor, based on which a directional thermal radiance model is built, and the directional radiant character for urban canopy is analyzed. The model is applied to a simple urban canopy with row structure to simulate the change of Directional Brightness Temperature (DBT). The results show that the DBT is aggrandized because of the multiple scattering effects, whereas the change range of DBT is smoothed. The temperature difference, spatial distribution, emissivity of the components can all lead to the change of DBT. The “hot spot ” phenomenon occurs when the proportion of high temperature component in the vision field came to a head. On the other hand, the “cool spot ” phenomena occur when low temperature proportion came to the head. The “spot ” effect disappears only when the proportion of every component keeps invariability.

As a result, the directionality of these LST products limits their further application in many fields. Accurate correction of the angular problem of LST products requires explicit {{understanding of the}} angular effects of emissivity at the pixel scale. Currently, nearly ten years of global emissivity products of MODIS are available. However, the pixel-scale directionality of emissivity has never been analyzed. By performing a statistical analysis of 5 -year MODIS emissivity products over most of East Asia, we generated the empirical relationships between the <b>directional</b> <b>emissivity,</b> land cover, and seasonal variations.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} tested that evolution has resulted in lower thermal emissivity of eggs of birds breeding openly in cold climates than of eggs of birds that nest under protective covering or in warmer climates. Directional thermal emissivity has been estimated from directional–hemispherical reflectance spectra. Due to several methodological difficulties the absolute emissivity is not accurately determined, but differences between species are obvious. Mostnotably, small waders of the genus Calidris, breeding in cold climates on the tundra, {{and in most cases}} with uniparental nest attendance, have low <b>directional</b> <b>emissivity</b> of their eggshells, about 0. 92 when integration is carried out for wavelengths up to 16 μm. Species belonging to Galloanserinae have the highest <b>directional</b> <b>emissivity,</b> about 0. 96, of their eggs. No differences due to climate or breeding conditions were found within this group. Eggs of most other birds tested possess intermediate emissivity, but the values for Pica pica and Corvus corone cornix are as low as for Calidris. Large species-dependent differences in spectral reflectance were found at specific wavelengths. For instance, at 4. 259 μm the directional–hemispherical reflectance for galliforms range from 0. 05 to 0. 09, while for Fratercula arctica and Fulmarus glacialis it is about 0. 3. The reflection peaks at 6. 5 and 11. 3 μm due to calcite are differentially attenuated in differents pecies. In conclusion, the hypothesis that evolution has resulted in lower thermal emissivity of bird-eggs being exposed in cold climates is not supported by our results. The emissivity is not clearly related to nesting habits or climate, and {{it is unlikely that the}} small differences observed are ecologically important. The spectral differences between eggs that nevertheless exist should be taken into account when using infrared thermometers for estimating the surface temperature of avian eggs...|$|E

(2) Non-Lambertian <b>directional</b> <b>emissivity</b> can account for only about 20 % of the observed thermal beaming factor.

(3) The maximum in a reststrahlen emissivity spectrum does not occur exactly at the Christiansen wavelength where, by definition, the real part of the refractive index equals one, but rather at the first transition minimum in reflectance associated with the transition from particle scattering being dominated by volume scattering to that dominated by strong surface scattering.
