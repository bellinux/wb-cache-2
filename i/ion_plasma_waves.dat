40|$|Some {{essential}} {{features of}} the <b>ion</b> <b>plasma</b> <b>wave</b> in both kinetic and fluid descriptions are presented. The wave develops at wavelengths shorter than the electron Debye radius. Thermal motion of electrons at this scale is such that they overshoot the electrostatic potential perturbation caused by ion bunching, which consequently propagates as an unshielded wave, completely unaffected by electron dynamics. So in the simplest fluid description, the electrons can {{be taken as a}} fixed background. However, in the presence of magnetic field and for the electron gyro-radius shorter than the Debye radius, electrons can participate in the wave and can increase its damping rate. This is determined by the ratio of the electron gyro-radius and the Debye radius.

40|$|On {{a number}} of {{occasions}} during the 3. 5 -yr operating lifetime of Rae 2, strong terrestrial kilometric radiation has been observed when the spacecraft was over {{the far side of the}} moon and when the low-altitude terrestrial magnetosphere was completely obscured from view. If these deep lunar occultation events are used to infer radio source locations, then it is found that the apparent source must sometimes be situated at geocentric distances of 10 - 40 earth-radii or more. From an analysis of these events, it is shown that they are probably due to propagation effects rather than the actual generation of the emission at such large distances. The kilometric radiation can be generated near the earth at auroral latitudes and subsequently strongly scattered in the magnetosheath and nearby solar wind to produce the large apparent distances.

The 2 p(23) P to 1 s 2 p(3) P and 2 s 2 p(3) P to 1 s 2 s(3) S transitions in helium and helium-like ions are treated as examples. The mixing of the doubly excited levels in the perturbing microfields produces Stark broadening of the emission lines and induces autoionization of the 2 p(23) P level, which, unlike the 2 s 2 p(3) P level, is metastable against autoionization in the field-free environment. Determination of the complete Stark-broadening profiles in thermal plasmas is complicated by the need to include the effects of both the (quasi-static) ion and the (dynamic) electron fields.

Evidently, the spacecraft frequently crosses the boundaries of these particle patterns.

In contrast to classical plasmas, quantum plasmas have extremely high plasma number densities and low temperatures. Quantum plasmas are composed of electrons, positrons and holes, which are degenerate. Positrons (holes) have the same (slightly different) mass as electrons, but opposite charge. The degenerate charged particles (electrons, positrons, and holes) obey the Fermi–Dirac statistics. In quantum plasmas, there are new forces associated with (i) quantum statistical electron and positron pressures, (ii) electron and positron tunneling through the Bohm potential, and (iii) electron and positron angular momentum spin. Inclusion of these quantum forces allows the existence of very high-frequency dispersive electrostatic and electromagnetic waves (e. g., in the hard X-ray and gamma-ray regimes) with extremely short wavelengths.

A review of what space plasma scientists have learned from these data and of their interpretations is presented. The interaction process begins millions of kilometers from the nucleus where the solar wind first picks up cometary ions that slow down the wind and causes the interplanetary magnetic field to pile up and drape around the comet's ionosphere. Thus the geometry of a comet's plasma tail is defined by this draped field. At Halley the Giotto spacecraft noted a well-defined boundary separating the mixture of solar wind and cometary plasmas and the interplanetary magnetic field from the free-field, almost pure cometary plasma in the inner coma.

The wind from the magnetically structured and active corona shows developed compressive turbulence and considerable abundance and ionization state variations. Some modelling attempts to explain the observed element fractionation are briefly reviewed. The causes of the nonthermal particle features. such as proton-ion differential streaming, ion beams. temperature anisotropies, and skewed distributions associated with collisionless heat conduction, are ultimately to be searched in the fact, that the corona is never quiescent but fundamentally variable in space and time.

Voyager 1 data are presented which show three distinct types of electrostatic ion waves occurring there: the Buchsbaum ion-ion mode just below the proton cyclotron frequency f(cp), hydrogen Bernstein modes at (n + 1 / 2) f(cp), and lower hybrid waves near f(LHR). The presence of these waves at their characteristic frequencies {{is consistent with a}} predominantly heavy <b>ion</b> <b>plasma</b> composed of singly ionized sulfur and oxygen ions along with a small admixture of protons. The hydrogen Bernstein modes are tightly confined to the magnetic equator, occurring within + or - 4 deg of it, while the Buchsbaum mode is localized to the dense heavy <b>ion</b> <b>plasma</b> of the cold torus near the centrifugal equator. A general theory for excitation of the waves based on the ion pickup process is developed...|$|R
40|$|Dispersion {{properties}} of electrostatic waves in a multi-ion plasma are examined, with an analysis that incorporates {{the effects of}} finite temperature, finite parallel wavenumber, and wave growth/damping in a systematic development of equations. Numerical solutions and analytic formulas are given for an <b>ion</b> <b>plasma</b> consisting of H(+), O(+), and S(+) for application to Jupiter's magnetosphere. It is demonstrated how observations of plasma resonance lines {{may be used as}} a diagnostic of ion composition in magnetospheric plasma. This potential use of high-sensitivity/high-resolution <b>plasma</b> <b>wave</b> instrumentation may provide information necessary to resolve issues concerning the origin of plasmas in the earth's neighborhood...|$|R
5000|$|Non-neutral plasmas {{are used}} for {{research}} into basic plasma phenomena such as cross-magnetic field transport, nonlinear vortex interactions, and <b>plasma</b> <b>waves</b> and instabilities. They have also been used to create cold neutral antimatter, by carefully mixing and recombining cryogenic pure positron and pure antiproton plasmas. Positron plasmas are also used in atomic physics experiments that study the interaction of antimatter with neutral atoms and molecules. Cryogenic pure <b>ion</b> <b>plasmas</b> {{have been used in}} studies of strongly coupled plasmas [...] and quantum entanglement. More prosaically, pure electron plasmas are used to produce the microwaves in microwave ovens, via the magnetron instability.|$|R
