500|$|Completed in 1918, the entranceway's {{featured}} {{element is}} the nearly semi-circular random ashlar stone half-walls on Roycroft Boulevard's axis of symmetry, {{which is at}} a 22 degree angle to Main Street. [...] The wall has one central and two end square posts that are approximately [...] in height and that <b>have</b> <b>poured</b> concrete caps that are not original. [...] Each post has a metal and glass contemporary street lamp projecting from its center. Quarter points of the arc have stone pilaster ornamentation. [...] The running portion of the wall has a continuous cast in place coping cap shaped at a 45 degree angle, which forms an attached buttress three quarters {{the height of the}} posts. [...] Past repairs have included incompatible stone and mortar patches. [...] The Main Street paving and the grassy median abut the convex and concave sides, respectively.

500|$|Hoxha {{delivered}} {{his speech to}} the Conference on November 16; he [...] "spoke of the tremendous Soviet pressures to which the Albanian party and government had been subjected after the Bucharest meeting... The only crime his régime had committed, the Albanian leader added, was {{that it did not}} agree that the Chinese communist party should be summarily and unjustly condemned. For this it had been treated in a manner that was shabby, anti-Marxist and uncomradely. Hoxha's speech had a shattering effect on the Moscow gathering." [...] Amongst other things Hoxha said that, according to Khrushchev, the Party of Labour and Albania itself [...] "should merely applaud and approve, but express no opinion of its own. But this is neither Marxist nor acceptable. Marxism-Leninism has granted us the right to have our say, and no one can take this from us, either by means of political and economic pressure, or by means of threats and names they might call us." [...] According to Alia, Khrushchev [...] "tried to appear calm" [...] when first replying, reading his written text [...] "almost mechanically" [...] in regards to China but as soon as he began to reply to Hoxha's speech [...] "he lost his head and began to shout, scream and splutter." [...] Khrushchev was said to have angrily remarked, [...] "Comrade Hoxha, you <b>have</b> <b>poured</b> a bucket of filth over me: {{you are going to have}} to wash it off again." [...] Jon Halliday states that, [...] "On this occasion Hoxha truly succeeded in putting himself and Albania on the world map. His denunciation of Khrushchev made headlines round the world and even his harshest critics usually concede that Hoxha turned in an able performance and showed personal courage." [...] In retirement Khrushchev later recalled the Conference and said that Hoxha [...] "bared his fangs at us even more menacingly than the Chinese themselves. After his speech, comrade Dolores Ibarruri, an old revolutionary and a devoted worker in the Communist movement, got up indignantly and said, very much to the point, that Hoxha was like a dog who bites the hand that feeds it." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Calvin [...] "was less {{clear-cut}} than Luther on Mary's perpetual virginity but undoubtedly favored it". He {{cautioned against}} what he thought as [...] "impious speculation" [...] on the topic. In his commentary of Luke 1:34, he rejected as [...] "unfounded and altogether absurd" [...] the idea that Mary had made a vow of perpetual virginity, saying that [...] "She would, in that case, have committed treachery by allowing herself to be united to a husband, and would <b>have</b> <b>poured</b> contempt on the holy covenant of marriage; which {{could not have been}} done without mockery of God" [...] and adding that {{there is no evidence of}} the existence of such vows at the time. Though celibacy or abstinence within marriage life was not unknown in Jewish tradition in response to God's command and participation in His service. In the Commentary on a Harmony of Matthew, Mark & Luke, Calvin rejected the argument that Mary had other children due to the mention in Scripture of brothers of Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|Storm surge {{flood waters}} appear to <b>have</b> <b>poured</b> into the Lower Ninth Ward {{from at least}} three sources.

The force of the water did not only flood homes, but smashed or knocked many off their foundations. [...] A large barge, the ING 4727 (owned by the Ingram Barge Company), was swept by flood waters into the neighborhood through the breach near Claiborne Avenue, leveling homes beneath it. The storm surge {{was so great that}} even the highest portions of the Lower 9th were flooded; Holy Cross School, which had served as a dry refuge after Hurricane Betsy, was inundated.

Writing in his weekly De Telegraaf column, Cruyff admitted, “Often the media are an additional tax, but the last week that has been different. The way in which a reply is posted via a variety of media in my situation, was emotional and heartwarming. I am extremely proud of the appreciation shown by all responses.” On his condition, Cruyff added, “Meanwhile, we have to wait. It’s really annoying that it has been leaked so quickly, because the only thing I know now is that I have lung cancer. No more. Because the investigation is ongoing.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Students at the {{university}} celebrate Autonomy Day on 1 July of each year. According to unverified sources, official autonomy was marked on 1 January 1965 with a [...] "symbolic ceremonial bonfire held {{at the site of}} the Great Hall". This celebration is said to have been officiated by Professor Godfrey Tanner who is said to <b>have</b> <b>poured</b> wine libations onto the ground as to [...] "sanctify the land upon which the University rests". Since {{the university}} technically became autonomous on 1 January 1965 autonomy day should be held on 1 January. 1 July actually coincided with the New South Wales University of Technology’s autonomy from the Public Service Board’s authority on 1 July 1954. According to Don Wright, students interpreted Autonomy Day as celebrating the autonomy of the University of Newcastle from the University of New South Wales. The students were entitled to give the celebration whatever meaning they chose. The fact that they called it ‘autonomy day’ heightened the students’ sense of the importance of autonomy and their need to defend it against outside interference.|$|E
2500|$|Marrakesh {{certainly}} {{continued to}} thrive {{as a tourist}} destination, initially as a luxury wintering spot for wealthy Westerners, but soon drawing a wider clientele. [...] The city became a trendy location to visit for hippies in the 1960s, a [...] "hippie mecca", attracting [...] numerous western rock stars and musicians, artists, film directors and actors, models, and fashion divas. Tourism revenues doubled in Morocco between 1965 and 1970. Yves Saint Laurent, The Beatles, The Stones and Jean-Paul Getty all spent significant time in the city; Laurent bought a property here and renovated the Majorelle Gardens. Due to {{the large number of}} American drifters arriving in Morocco and visiting Marrakech in the early 1970s, Moroccans were growing increasingly discontent that their country was being used as a [...] "sort of countercultural waterhole". A 1973 article in The Nation reported that a crackdown by the Moroccan authorities had begun on westerners with long hair. By the mid-1970s, the dope colony which had formed in Morocco had been cleared out. Expatriates with stylistic aspirations, especially from France, <b>have</b> <b>poured</b> investment into the city since this period, and developed many of the riads and palaces.

2500|$|The staged {{premiere of}} Donnerstag {{was very well}} {{received}} in Italy, where it was awarded the Italian Music Critics' Prize for best new work in December 1981. The German press reception, on the other hand, was harsh and often ad hominem [...] The Covent Garden production in 1985 also provoked contrary points of view in the press, in part divided over {{the question of the}} music versus the theatrical conception. Paul Griffiths, writing in the Times, for example, found that [...] "it contains much quite extraordinary music" [...] but [...] "the opera never for a moment works as the mystic revelation it pretends to be. … It is very wondrous to contemplate—wondrous, that is, when it is not just silly" [...] Andrew Porter, on the contrary, found the [...] "variety of forces, forms, textures, and matter … a strength and a pleasure", and the [...] "somewhat ramshackle construction saves the work from solemn pretentiousness. There's even a playful quality about much of it, although its essential seriousness is not in doubt and inner musical integrity is not compromised" [...] Porter concludes, hearing and seeing the drama is an engrossing, enjoyable, and elevating adventure. Ear, mind, and spirit are engaged. And, as I suggested, moments of jokiness, naïveté—silliness, even—save the work from being unbearably solemn: Stockhausen-Sarastro has a vein of Papageno in him. There is a great deal to listen to and to watch. Some of the spans, especially in the last scene, are traversed slowly. But things happen; the music doesn't fall into simplistic repetitions or numbing stasis. There are counterpoints to follow. There are supple melodies and rich harmonies. There are wonderful sounds—new and stirring sounds. The score is a culmination of the marvellous musics—in whose making Michael's vision, Lucifer's technical skills, and the inspiration of Eve's love seem to have conspired—that <b>have</b> <b>poured</b> from Stockhausen during the last thirty years. … But what matters most now is the excitement of entering this huge, ambitious work, responding to its sounds and sights, trying to understand it, and feeling, perhaps, that it is—by intention at least—something like a Divine Comedy and a Comédie Humaine in one.|$|E
