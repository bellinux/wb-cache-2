5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations {{can only be}} correctly <b>explained</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of a language of thought (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified {{in the brain and}} not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, the same {{philosophers}} also claimed that common-sense mental states {{simply do not}} exist. But critics pointed out that eliminativists could not have it both ways: either mental states exist and will ultimately be <b>explained</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of lower-level neurophysiological processes or they do not. Modern eliminativists have much more clearly expressed the view that mental phenomena simply do not exist and will eventually be eliminated from people's thinking about the brain {{in the same way}} that demons have been eliminated from people's thinking about mental illness and psychopathology.|$|E

We probed how people apply the concepts of weakness and strength of will to prototypical and non-prototypical scenarios. While regarding prototypical scenarios the great majority applied these concepts according to the predictions following from traditional philosophical analyses. When presented with non-prototypical scenarios, people were divided. Some, against traditional analyses, did not apply these concepts, which we <b>explain</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of a clash of evaluations involving different sorts of blame and credit.

5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be <b>explained</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the even more familiar mechanical resonance) {{found its way into}} filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the resonant frequency but will not respond to frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are filtered out from the output of the device.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} his theodicy {{required}} Hick to propose an eschatology in which humans are fully morally developed. He proposed a universalist theory, arguing that all humans would eventually reach heaven. Hick believed {{that there would be}} no benefit or purpose to an eternal Hell, as it would render any moral development inconsequential. The eternal suffering of Hell could not be <b>explained</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of human development, so Hick rejected it. Despite this, he did not reject the existence of Hell outright, as to do so could make living morally in this life irrelevant. Rather, he argued that Hell exists as a mythological concept and as a warning of the importance of this life.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} {{minerals}} present in volcanic ash {{are dependent on}} the chemistry of the magma from which it erupted. Considering that the most abundant elements found in silicate magma are silicon and oxygen, {{the various types of}} magma (and therefore ash) produced during volcanic eruptions are most commonly <b>explained</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of their silica content. Low energy eruptions of basalt produce a characteristically dark coloured ash containing ~45 - 55% silica that is generally rich in iron (Fe) and magnesium (Mg). The most explosive rhyolite eruptions produce a felsic ash that is high in silica (>69%) while other types of ash with an intermediate composition (e.g., andesite or dacite) have a silica content between 55-69%.|$|E

5|$|Although such a {{long-range}} {{attack on a}} state far from {{the centre of the}} Empire may seem extraordinary (the last time the Empire had attempted anything on this scale was the failed invasion of Sicily over one hundred and twenty years earlier), it can be <b>explained</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of Manuel's foreign policy, which was to use the Latins to ensure the survival of the Empire. This focus on the bigger picture of the eastern Mediterranean and even further afield thus led Manuel to intervene in Egypt: it was believed that {{in the context of the}} wider struggle between the crusader states and the Islamic powers of the east, control of Egypt would be the deciding factor. It had become clear that the ailing Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt held the key to the fate of the crusader states. If Egypt came out of its isolation and joined forces with the Muslims under Nur ad-Din, the crusader cause was in trouble.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim's {{period in}} Germany {{resulted}} in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed {{by the work of}} Wilhelm Wundt. Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the University of Bordeaux in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course. His official title was Chargé d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de Pédagogie and thus he taught both pedagogy and sociology (the latter had never been taught in France before). The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of the change of times, and also the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences. From this position Durkheim helped reform the French school system and introduced the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be <b>explained</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> purely of social interaction earned him many critics.|$|E
5|$|Monism is the {{position}} that mind and body are not ontologically distinct entities (independent substances). This view was first advocated in Western philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BC and was later espoused by the 17th century rationalist Baruch Spinoza. Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually be <b>explained</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve. Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties (many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism), and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear. Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind. Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events {{in the world can}} be thought of as either mental (psychological) or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter, and dual-aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to {{the position}} that there is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance. The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type identity theory, anomalous monism and functionalism.|$|E

25|$|Another {{application}} of the principle {{is to be found}} in the work of George Berkeley (1685–1753).

He invoked Occam's razor against materialism, stating that matter was not required by his metaphysic and was thus eliminable.
