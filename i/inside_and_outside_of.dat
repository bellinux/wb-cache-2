Although a commercial failure domestically, it has been screened at many international film festivals and won several awards both <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> Indonesia. Critical reviews have generally been positive, mostly emphasising the film's visuals.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800, Caernarfon's local {{corporation}} {{undertook a}} programme of modernisation work, inserting several new gateways {{in the town}} walls; other changes were also made to the walls during the period, with some towers being converted for use as administrative buildings and the gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices. During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably, prompted by the slate trade {{and the construction of}} the Chester to Holyhead railway line. As a result of this population pressure, by the 20th century housing had encroached along the <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the town walls, so that in many places the walls had vanished from view. During the 20th century the walls were gradually acquired by the state and these houses demolished.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} a turn-based combat {{system in which}} party members and enemy Mirages take turns to perform actions such as attacking, casting spells, and using items. The player's party consists of three main characters which, {{with the exception of}} main character Itsuki, can be swapped out both <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> battle. Similar to both Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tenseis battle systems, party members and enemies each have strengths and weaknesses against certain types of physical attacks, such as swords and arrows, and elemental attacks, such as fire and ice. The affinities of each party member change depending on the weapon they have equipped.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925 {{tensions}} between the Druze chiefs of the Hauran led by Sultan Pasha al-Atrash and the French authorities culminated with the Great Syrian Revolt, which spread throughout Syria within months. While Quwatli's Istiqlal Party lobbied the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini {{to set up a}} financial support network for the rebellion, Quwatli had already secured the funneling of funds and arms from the Hejaz and also diverted some of the military aid to the Jerusalem-based committee. As the revolt's initial momentum began to recede in mid-1926, bickering between opposition leaders, <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> Syria, increased significantly. Quwatli was accused by his rivals in Cairo of pocketing some money he raised and paying off rebels to prevent rebel raids against his family's extensive apricot orchards in the Ghouta. Tensions between Istiqlalists like Quwatli and Arslan and other Syrian nationalist leaders like al-Bakri and Shahbandar, were particularly sharp, with the latter accusing Quwatli of being out of touch from the realities of the revolt, and Quwatli accusing Shahbandar of treason for attempting to stop the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|On Saint Lucia, wakes {{are held}} on the first and eighth night after a person has died, in {{contrast}} to other Caribbean islands, which hold their wakes on the first and ninth days. Wakes often include music, such as the singing of hymns and drumming. Traditional music for wakes is performed both <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the deceased's house. The mourners inside the house sing from a repertoire of songs that are in English and not French Creole, because they are derived from the English-using songs of Lucian churches. The songs include both hymns and sankeys (gospel songs), and are generally responsorial, led by a male singer with the slow, unsyncopated responses of the chorus in unison. The mourners outside the house traditionally perform drumming {{and a kind of}} responsorial song performed in Creole and without accompaniment, called kont. These songs often related to the death of the deceased, and may deal with the cause of death, the last words or events surrounding the death. Mourners also dance to both the débòt and bélè, accompanied zo or tibwa and ka.|$|E
5|$|The ER has {{a central}} role in producing, processing, and {{transporting}} biochemical compounds for use <b>inside</b> <b>and</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the cell. Its membrane is the site of production of all the transmembrane proteins and lipids for most of the cell's organelles, including the ER itself, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, endosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane. Furthermore, almost all of the proteins that will exit the cell, plus those destined for the lumen of the ER, Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes, are originally delivered to the ER lumen. Consequently, many of the proteins found in the cisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen are there only temporarily as they pass on their way to other locations. Other proteins, however, constantly remain in the lumen and are known as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. These special proteins contain a specialized retention signal made up of a specific sequence of amino acids that enables them to be retained by the organelle. An example of an important endoplasmic reticulum resident protein is the chaperon protein known as BiP which identifies other proteins that have been improperly built or processed and keeps them from being sent to their final destinations.|$|E
