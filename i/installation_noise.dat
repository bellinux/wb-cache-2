40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that {{unwanted}} noise has many harmful effects on human beings. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} limit noise in the living and working environment as much as possible. Structure-borne <b>installation</b> <b>noise</b> is noise which originates because vibrating objects like machines or ducts are connected to the building structure. The structure radiates the induced vibrations as sound in each space of the building. The ambition of this dissertation is to quantitatively determine the supplied structure-borne power in the source space on one hand and the resulting <b>installation</b> <b>noise</b> in the receiver space on the other hand. This way, the acoustical quality of a building can already be judged in the design phase and, if necessary, parameters can be changed if the obtained acoustical quality is insufficient. A straightforward technique to determine the injected structure-borne sound power uses simultaneous measurement of the force and the velocity at the contact points between installation and building element. However, measuring the force directly is difficult in practice, which is why a structural-acoustical inverse technique is used which allows the force to be determined indirectly using the principle of reciprocity. A number of predictive techniques are tested to determine the injected structure-borne sound power. Advantages and difficulties are discussed for a vibrating platform, washing machine and tapping machine as sources and heavyweight concrete floors, a lightweight wooden floor and a floating floor as receiving building elements. Since the result depends on the specific situation of installation and building element, there is no reliable technique which is universally applicable. Dominating airborne sound transmission, non-linear behaviour of installations and matrix inversions are shown to be important points of attention. The most popular predictive techniques are critically analysed, which brings out some interesting conclusions. 1. Introduction and research goals 2. <b>Installation</b> <b>noise</b> 3.

40|$|Propulsive life {{noise is}} the {{increase}} in noise that occurs when airframe surfaces are placed in the propulsive system's exhaust to increase their lift force. Increased local flow velocities and turbulence levels, due to the propulsive system exhaust gases passing along the airframe lifting surfaces, cause an increase in maximum lift coefficient. The airplane's flight speed required for takeoff and landing can then be significantly reduced, allowing operation from shorter runways than those of conventional commercial airports. Unfortunately, interaction of high velocity turbulent exhaust flow with the airframe's solid surfaces generates additional noise radiation. Aeroacoustic processes that cause propulsive lift noise also are present in airframe noise and propulsive system <b>installation</b> <b>noise.</b> Research studies of propulsive lift noise led to development of improved methods of predicting noise radiation from surfaces in turbulent flows.

40|$|Very large {{aircraft}} - {{such as the}} planned Airbus A 3 XX - require correspondingly high lift forces and extended landing gear structures, thus causing potentially very high airframe noise levels during landing approach.

Recognizing the general challenge of research for aircraft noise reduction at that time, a European Noise Reduction Initiative (ENRI) was proposed, dealing with both engine- and airframe-noise. Subsequent technical discussiond, however, led to separate programmes for engine- and airframe noise research, the latter being initiated under the acronym RAIN (Reduction of Airframe and <b>Installation</b> <b>Noise).</b> RAIN encompasses analytical and experimental work to describe, predict and reduce the noise both from landing gears and high lift devices. In parallel national research programmes began: In France wind tunnel and flyover experiments relate to the whole aircraft airframe noise characteristics, while corresponding research in Germany focusses on high lift devices noise.

40|$|The {{expected}} {{increase in}} stringence of the ICAO Chapter- 3 noise certification limits necessitates {{the development of}} source noise reduction technologies for subsonic commercial aeroplanes. The noise from such aeroplanes during landing approach is largely dominated by airframe noise, i. e. the noise generated by the interaction of flow and those aircraft components deployed for landing, such as the landing gears and the wing high-lift devices. In the mid-nineties, DLR had been under contract to Airbus Industrie to investigate the noise from Airbus-type aircraft landing gears. More recently, DLR has entered into two major - still ongoing - pertinent research programs: first, a German National Program on commercial aeroplane airframe noise reduction (sponsored by the German Ministry of Research and Education, BMBF) to specially investigate the noise from high-lift devices, and, second, a European program {{under the auspices of}} the EU entitled Reduction of Airframe and <b>Installation</b> <b>Noise</b> (acronym RAIN), dealing with airframe noise from both landing gears and high lift devices.

The impact of angular inow on these installation e_ects was quanti_ed at the Large Low-Speed Facility of the German-Dutch wind tun- nels (DNW-LLF). Particle-image-velocimetry measurements showed that the pylon wake's width and velocity de_cit were hardly a_ected by the introduction of a six-degree sideslip angle. Application of pylon trailing-edge blowing reduced the integral velocity de_cit in the wake by up to 65 %. Evaluations of the surface pressures on the blades con_rmed the sinusoidal loading behavior in angular inow and the impulsive loading peak {{due to the}} pylon-wake encounter. The circumferential velocity components induced by the pylon tip vortex strongly a_ected the steady-state propeller performance by modifying the e_ective advance ratio sensed by the blades. Increased performance was measured when the rota- tion direction of the pylon tip vortex was opposite to that of the propeller. Angular inow a_ected the propeller noise emissions due to the resulting unsteady blade loads and the circumferential variation of the e_ective Mach number of the blade sections. The instal- lation of the pylon added a noise source due to the unsteady blade loads caused by the pylon-wake encounter.

40|$|Aerodynamic noise {{originating}} from slotted slats represents the {{major component of}} high-lift related airframe noise. Therefore slatless high-lift systems are considered effective means to reduce airframe noise. The major challenge within the design of such systems is to compensate the deficit in maximum lift performance for slatless wings, and the possibility to remove the gap between main airfoil and Fowler flap. One way to achieve the required high-lift capabilities is active flow control, like e. g. wing trailing edge blowing. Such a circulation control technology was investigated in the EU co-financed research project TimpAN (Technology to improve Airframe Noise). Both numerically and experimentally obtained results showed the expected good aerodynamic performance. High lift coefficients could be achieved with a limited fraction of the cold engine flow used for blowing. In this paper the results from noise measurements on a wing-flap configuration using circulation control to generate high lift are documented. Noise tests were performed in the open test section of the Acoustic Wind Tunnel Braunschweig for predefined operational conditions. A comparison of noise data for the 3 -element DLR F 16 high-lift model of the same profile geometry and for the same lift performance shows that a noise reduction {{in the order of}} 3 dB to 6 dB is achieved for the 2 -element high-lift wing with flow control in the frequency range between 2 kHz and 20 kHz (at model scale), while a noise increase is observed to occur at low frequencies.

40|$|Aims: The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the amount of noise pollution and traffic rates in Khojir National park and regarding that finding a suitable distance for installing fencing according to the standard level of noise pollution. Materials and Methods: Eight stations located exactly above channels have been selected. In each station, three different substations including near the road, 25, and 50 m from the road were chosen. For determining the essentiality of soundproof <b>installation,</b> <b>noise</b> levels were measured at the opening and in the middle of the channel. Traffic rates have been measured daily from 6 AM to 6 PM for two continuous weeks and noise levels were then determined in three different days according to the traffic peak. Results: Results obtained showed a significant relationship between traffic rates and noise levels in near-road stations (R 2 linear = 0. 341). The relationship between interval and noise level was also significant (R 2 quadratic = 0. 701, P < 0. 05). Furthermore, a distance with 55 dB (A) (i. e., 50 m in this study) was achieved as a proper site for fencing. Conclusion: Although the amount of noise levels in the middle of channels were less than the standard level, this amount in some channel throats were higher and need to be considered for soundproof installation as well. In addition to finding an area for fencing, using solution(s) for reducing either noise pollution or its impact at this area should be taken into consideration...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{solution to}} leading-edge noise {{produced by a}} translating two-dimensional flat plate ingesting turbulence in proximity to a hard-wall is presented. This is a relevant problem to calculate the <b>installation</b> <b>noise</b> of open rotors and un-ducted fans. The analytical {{solution to the problem}} is given by using Amiet’s flat plate theory in conjunction with the Method Of Images (MOI) to include the effects of the wall. The low frequency, low Mach number limit of the analytical solution is investigated and it is shown that the flat plate in this limit behaves like a compact vertical dipole. The analytical solution is verified by a Computational AeroAcoustic (CAA) simulation that also uses the MOI to simulate a wall. While the MOI gives an approximation of the wall, it does not model all of the effects, such as diffraction from the edges of the flat plate and acoustic shielding due to the presence of the flat plate. These effects, which are ignored in the MOI are quantified using a CAA simulation that models the wall using a hard-slip-wall boundary condition. It is found that the analytical predictions and the CAA simulations using the MOI compare well. However, when the MOI is compared to the CAA simulation using a hard-slip-wall boundary condition, it is found that the MOI does not capture the effect of the shadow zone that is created due to the shielding effect of the aerofoil. The extent of the shadow zone is modified by changing the height of the aerofoil from the wall, and it shown that as the height of the aerofoil from the wall is increased, the shielding effect decreases...|$|E

40|$|Tutorialpg. 203 - 212 This {{paper will}} review the best {{practices}} for installation of a centrifugal air compressor without a sound enclosure to obtain the best acoustic environment for reduced operating noise levels. An overview of the noise sources associated with a centrifugal air compressor will be discussed along with the noise attenuation techniques. Moreover, proper selection and installation of accessory hardware associated with the compressor installation will be addressed, since the accessory hardware can often generate higher noise levels than the compressor if not selected and installed correctly. Guidelines for valve sizing, proper lagging of piping and valves for noise reduction, drain line noise attenuation, inlet silencer selection, discharge silencer selection and silencer installation will also be explored. The refining, petrochemical, oil and gas, automotive, steel, electronic and industrial applications utilize centrifugal air compressors to provide utility air to support manufacturing their processes. They are often purchased to meet a specified noise level based on customer site requirements. Compressors that meet the noise requirement without using a complete sound enclosure are preferred. This is due to both the high cost associated with sound enclosures and because sound enclosures make access to the compressor difficult for maintenance. Figure 1 shows a typical centrifugal air compressor package for a refinery application. Proper site development is important for reduced noise levels while the equipment is in operation. Outdoor installations do not exactly replicate a Free Field noise environment; indoor installations are often reverberant in nature because of building construction. In any case, when the compressor is in operation, the noise level measured with a sound level meter is often higher than the actual compressor generated noise.
