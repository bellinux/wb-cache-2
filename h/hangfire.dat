Usual powder charges start in excess of [...] Due to the large capacity case, charges less than 90% load density are not usually recommended. <b>Hangfires</b> with cartridges such as the [...]460 Weatherby are extremely unpleasant.

500|$|On July 16, 1945, Bainbridge and {{his colleagues}} {{conducted}} the Trinity nuclear test.

[...] To his relief, the explosion of the first atomic bomb went off without such drama, in what he later described as [...] "a foul and awesome display". He turned to Oppenheimer and said, [...] "Now we are all sons of bitches." ...|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{frequency}} of electrically initiated, 20 mm munition <b>hangfires</b> (delayed ignitions), a joint Army/NASA investigation was conducted to recommend quality evaluation improvements for acceptance of both primers and gun propellant. This effort focused only on evaluating ignition and combustion performance as potential causes of hangfires: poor electrical initiation of the primer, low output performance of the primer, low ignition sensitivity of the gun propellant, {{and the effects of}} cold temperature. The goal was to determine the "best" of the Army and NASA test methods to assess the functional performance of primers and gun propellants. The approach was to evaluate the performance of both high-quality and deliberately defective primers to challenge the sensitivity of test methods. In addition, the ignition sensitivity of different manufacturing batches of gun propellants was evaluated. The results of the investigation revealed that improvements can be made in functional evaluations that can assist in identifying and reducing ignition and performance variations. The "best" functional evaluation of primers and propellant is achieved through a combination of both Army and NASA test methods. Incorporating the recommendations offered in this report may provide for considerable savings in reducing the number of cartridge firings, while significantly lowering the rejection rate of primer, propellant and cartridge lots. The most probable causes for ignition and combustion-related <b>hangfires</b> were the lack of calcium silicide in the primer mix, a low output performance of primers, and finally, poor ignition sensitivity of gun propellant. Cold temperatures further reduce propellant ignition sensitivity, as well as reducing burn rate and chamber pressures...|$|R

50|$|In a soft-recoil system, {{the spring}} (or air cylinder) that returns the barrel to the forward {{position}} starts {{out in a}} nearly fully compressed position, then the gun's barrel is released free to fly forward in the moment before firing; the charge is then ignited just as the barrel reaches the fully forward position. Since the barrel is still moving forward when the charge is ignited, {{about half of the}} recoil impulse is applied to stopping the forward motion of the barrel, while the other half is, as in the usual system, taken up in recompressing the spring. A latch then catches the barrel and holds it in the starting position. This roughly halves the energy that the spring needs to absorb, and also roughly halves the peak force conveyed to the mount, as compared to the usual system. However, the need to reliably achieve ignition at a single precise instant is a major practical difficulty with this system; and unlike the usual hydro-pneumatic system, soft-recoil systems do not easily deal with <b>hangfires</b> or s. One of the early guns to use this system was the French 65 mm mle.1906; it was also used by the World War II British PIAT man-portable anti-tank weapon.|$|R

50|$|Dashiell Qwerty {{is found}} dead inside his jail cell, and Theodora {{is assumed to}} be the murderer by the Officers Mitchum. However, Lemony doesn't believe she did it, so he goes about the train looking for witnesses. He finds three {{suspicious}} librarians named Pocket, Walleye and Eratosthenes, along with several of his associates who were also on board. He then finds Ellington Feint; shortly into their conversation, <b>Hangfire</b> arrives and shoots a dart at Ellington, who falls on the floor. Snicket sees that the dart misses Ellington but pretends she is dead in an attempt to trick <b>Hangfire.</b>|$|E
50|$|When Lemony {{returns to}} the Lost Arms he finds Theodora beaten. She reveals that Sharon {{attacked}} her. Lemony finds Pip and Squeak hiding from the Department of Truancy. He goes to the school to investigate and is knocked unconscious; he wakes up in Ellington Feint's room in the school. She pretends to be a student called Filene N. Gottlin. Lemony and Ellington meet with Moxie, Jake, Cleo, Keller and Ornette Lost (Prosper Lost's daughter) in the school library, though all the books are blank. It is revealed by Keller {{that he and his}} mother aided <b>Hangfire</b> in order to save his sister, Lizzie. Snicket comes up with a fragmentary plot and his friends all help to carry it out. Stew Mitchum and <b>Hangfire</b> warn Lemony that they will kill him if necessary before beating him up. <b>Hangfire,</b> the villain behind the arsons, attempts to mislead Snicket into thinking Dicey's Department Store is being burned down, but Snicket works out that he is planning to burn down the library. He removes the books before <b>Hangfire</b> can burn it down, although the building ends up being saved by the recently installed sprinkler system. Stew confronts Lemony and Ellington at the library, leading to Ellington being arrested for the destruction of the books. Lemony replaced the full books with the empty ones found at the school library. He then hides the full books at Black Cat Coffee. A younger Josephine then talks to Lemony about how his sister, Kit, was arrested.|$|E
50|$|After {{negotiation}} with <b>Hangfire</b> {{and with the}} Mitchums, Snicket is able to gather everybody aboard the train together in the jail cell where Qwerty was killed. He uses the statue of the Bombinating Beast to summon the real creature and when it arrives, he pushes <b>Hangfire</b> towards the monster to his death. The passengers on board are shocked and refuse {{to make eye contact}} with Snicket, even his friends and Ellington Feint. Everyone gets off the train and it is revealed that Kit Snicket, Lemony's sister, was aboard the whole time. A member of V.F.D. talks to Snicket privately and chastises him for ruining their plan. The series ends with Lemony walking away, alone, into the Clusterous Forest.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>hangfire</b> {{should be}} {{suspected}} whenever a firearm fails to fire, {{but has not}} clearly malfunctioned. In modern firearms, {{it is more likely}} that the round is a [...] "dud" [...] (one that will never fire at all), but it is important to delay removing the round from the chamber. If a <b>hangfire</b> has in fact occurred, a round initiating outside of the firearm could cause serious injury. If the operator believes that the firearm correctly cycled a fresh round and the action is not visibly jammed, the correct procedure is to keep the firearm pointed at a safe target for thirty seconds, then remove the round. This rule is usually not followed in combat, where being without a working firearm is the bigger risk.|$|E

She and her accomplice had been living in the abandoned mansion, setting up a facade to convince Markson to steal the statue for them, or more specifically, him, the man pretending to be her butler, and, as Snicket soon realizes, <b>Hangfire.</b>|$|E
5000|$|What the [...]458 Lott lacks in {{velocity}} and energy {{compared to the}} [...]450 Rigby or the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum, it more than makes up for {{by virtue of its}} versatility. Larger volume cases such as the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum do not do well with powder charges below the recommended minimums. This is due to the erratic ignition and <b>hangfire</b> issues experienced when large capacity cartridges are loaded with small powder charges. The Lott has no such issues and takes well to lower powder charges.|$|E
50|$|Moxie and Lemony walk to {{the library}} to {{investigate}} the case; they research invisible ink and Colonel Colophon, a war hero of Stain'd by the Sea who had a clinic built {{for him in the}} town.

Following the woman, he ends up finding Ellington Feint in an abandoned aquarium; she has been posing as Cleo Knight and pretending to work on invisible ink for <b>Hangfire.</b> Lemony causes a distraction and they both escape, although Ellington is arrested.|$|E
