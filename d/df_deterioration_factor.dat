The re-duction of distribution transformer no-load loss is particularly im-portant as {{the ratio of}} no-load to load losses is nearly three. In this paper, the no-load operation of wound-core transformers under sinusoidal and distorted supply-voltage conditions is investigated. For that purpose, a 2 -D nonlinear transient finite-element analysis taking into account hysteresis has been developed. The hysteresis model {{is based on a}} modified Jiles–Atherton representation, and the proposed analysis is compared to experimental data.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the time-variant flexural reliability {{analysis of a}} RC highway bridge strengthened with CFRP. Three <b>deterioration</b> <b>factors</b> are dealt with. The first is the growth of traffic live load over time. The second is the resistance deterioration of steel reinforcing bars due to corrosion. The third is the deterioration due to aging of CFRP. The reliability analysis is performed implementing five flexural failure modes. A Monte-Carlo simulation is used to develop time-dependent statistical models for steel areas and daily live load extreme effects. The reliability of a RC bridge CFRP-strengthened interior beam, designed in accordance to AASHTO-LRFD (Load and Resistance Factor Design) specifications, is evaluated under various traffic volumes, different corrosion environments and strengthening configurations. The results of the analysis have shown that, among the <b>deterioration</b> <b>factors,</b> corrosion has the most significant effect on a bridge service life followed by live load growth. We introduce a probabilistic-based strengthening efficiency factor which allows comparing different types of CFRP or assessing influence of plate end anchorage options.

To achieve the objective, {{a large number of}} long term pavement performance (LTPP) test sites were set up throughout the six SEQ regions. The methodology for the selection of the SEQ-LTPP test sites and the rationale behind the design of the LTPP site selection matrix are discussed. Pavement condition data were collected from the LTPP test sites over a period of five years. Modelling of the pavement deterioration at the test sites were carried out using SMEC pavement management system (SMEC PMS) with HDM-III deterioration models. The aim was to determine the most appropriate HDM-III roughness <b>deterioration</b> <b>factors</b> for the six regions covered in the study. Three statistical techniques namely; linear rate of roughness deterioration (LRRD), regression analysis and statistical t test approach were used in analysing the roughness data obtained from the LTPP sites and the predicted roughness data generated by SMEC PMS.

With growing demand and wider applications of these strengthening systems, it is their durability that has recently received significant attention from the research community, largely {{in the form of}} laboratory testing of deteriorated FRP-to-concrete joints. To develop generalized <b>deterioration</b> <b>factors,</b> a database of shear tests has been collected to quantitatively assess the change in bond characteristics across a number of environmental conditions. It has been identified that a major shortcoming of existing test data is that reporting of the full-range load-displacement behavior is very limited.

The investigation consists of continually immersing specimens in water, a 5 % salt solution, and, for the first time, a sulfuric acid solution of pH 4. 0 to simulate the pooling of acid rain.

The ruins were left uncovered and exposed to climatic deterioration until 1994, when scientific members of the Fac-ulty of Archaeology of Cairo University undertook a study of the degradation processes affecting the Temple. This started with field-based observation of the monument’s condition and, description of the building materials, (limestone and mortar). In 1997 samples of the building material were collected on site and in 1998 laboratory studies of those samples were carried out in the Department of Geomechanics at the Warsaw University. The laboratory studies comprised two main steps: diagnosis of the <b>deterioration</b> <b>factors</b> and their geomechanical interpretation as an effect of salt solution, water saturation and temperature changes. The behaviour of building limestone and mortar were considered relative to their mineralogical composition, internal structure and path of deformation.

Both applied methods showed the salt solutions to be the main <b>deterioration</b> <b>factor</b> affecting the stone elements and the anisotropy and various properties of the mortar and of the bedded limestone as the main factors destabilising the construction of the Temple as a whole.

Cyrene {{is one of}} the most important archaeological sites in the world, and since 1982 has been on the list of World Heritage Sites, meeting criteria (ii), (iii) and (vi) of the World Heritage List (WHL), relating to human civilization values, aesthetic importance, and developments in architecture or technology. But unfortunately, the site has come under a wide range of threats, duly noted and followed up by The World Heritage Committee. As a result, the Department of Antiquities (DoA) has been asked on more than one occasion to work to find appropriate solutions to protect, save and secure Cyrene. Despite the realization and understanding of these risks and threats by both the Department of Antiquities (DoA) and The World Heritage Committee (WHC), solutions have remained elusive, but new evidence identified by this study has confirmed that there is a very close relationship between good knowledge, the clear classification of <b>deterioration</b> <b>factors</b> and the discovery or creation of solutions for the problem, because clear understanding of these factors is the most important step in finding the right solutions. This thesis is divided into four chapters. The first chapter provides the geographic and historic introduction, and also describes the archaeology and landscape of the wider site. Moreover, it discusses also the role of travellers and explorers and their work, and the very beginnings of the founding of the Department of Antiquities.

However, new vehicle standards are only beneficial if effectively lead to emissions reduction; this implies assuring compliance with emissions limits not only for new registrations but also throughout vehicles’ useful life. With this aim, current legislation introduced emissions durability requirements; alternatively to actual in-use driving, the normative also proposes tailored accelerated aging procedures for PI and CI vehicles (Standard Bench Cycle and Standard Diesel Bench Cycle respectively) or the application of assigned <b>deterioration</b> <b>factors.</b> Whereas the fast aging protocol for vehicles with PI engine had already been successfully applied, the newly introduced approach for CI vehicles fast aging still has to prove its validity. The present report aims at contributing to a deeper understanding of aftertreatment system aging mechanisms and methods in order to assess Euro- 6 vehicles durability approach. An overview on the legislative background is given before introducing an investigation on deterioration mechanisms that could critically affect most commonly implemented aftertreatment devices. The current accelerated aging procedure is then presented in greater detail, with focus on differences between gasoline and diesel vehicles approach; differences between European and American fast aging strategies are also discussed.
