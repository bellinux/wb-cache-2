These {{are caused by}} harmful algal blooms (HAB), also known as red tide or green tide. HABs {{have been known to}} produce a wide range of toxins, with newer toxins discovered frequently, which makes the task of understanding these phenomena increasingly difficult. HAB can be found in water of high importance for {{economic and}} environment; with salinity ranging from low to high such as in rivers and lakes to reservoirs and oceans. Toxins seeped into water column where it can get into water supply and affecting humans and livestock. Toxins can have either direct or indirect effect towards an organism. Some marine life is susceptible to toxins caused by HABs while others are affected through accumulation of toxins over a period of time; such as filter-feeding shell¬fish and secondary consumers. It has been estimated that there are thousands of human poisoning cases annually in Asia from toxic water. Single HAB <b>fish-kill</b> events in Korea have been estimated to have cost from $1-100 million in lost fish, while in Japan such events have been estimated to have resulted in losses of fish worth more than $300 million.|$|E

40|$|The {{reduction}} in external phosphorus load to Lake Ringsjön during the 1980 s, {{did not result}} in improved water transparency during the following ten-year period. Furthermore, a <b>fish-kill</b> in the Eastern Basin of the lake, in addition to a cyprinid reduction programme (biomanipulation; 1988 – 1992), in contrast to theory, did not lead to any increase in zooplankton biomass or size. This absence of response in the pelagic food chain may have been attributed to the increase in abundance of YOY (0 +) fish, following the fish reduction programme. Despite the lack of effect on zooplankton, there was a decrease in phytoplankton biomass, a change in species composition and an increase in water transparency following biomanipulation. In 1989, one year after the <b>fish-kill</b> in Eastern Basin, the Secchi depth (summer mean) increased from 60 cm to 110 cm. In the following years, water transparency increased further, despite an increase in phosphorus loading. An unexpected effect of the biomanipulation was an increase in benthic invertebrate and staging waterfowl abundances, which occurred 2 – 4 years after fish reduction. Hence, the response in the benthic community following biomanipulation was considerably stronger than in the pelagic community. A likely explanation is that {{reduction in}} abundance of the benthic feeding fish species bream (Abramis brama), strongly affected the benthic invertebrate fauna.

Phosphorus loading decreased to a much smaller extent than nitrogen loading. In L. Võrtsjärv both N and P concentrations followed the decreasing trends of loading, which show the high sensitivity of large shallow lakes to catchment processes. Our study showed {{a positive relationship between}} P content in sediments and the relative depth of the lake. Assumingly the resilience of a lake in responding to the reduction of nutrient loading decreases together with the decrease of its relative depth. In L. Peipsi the concentration of P has not decreased since the 1990 s. Our data show indirectly that P loading from Russia to L. Peipsi may have increased. The N/P ratio has decreased in both lakes. Cyanobacterial blooms have been common in both lakes already {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century. The blooms disappeared during heavy nitrogen loading in the 1980 s but started again in L. Peipsi in recent years together with the drop of the N/P ratio. In L. Võrtsjärv the N/P ratio is higher and the ecosystem is more stable although the share of N 2 -fixing cyanobacteria increased from the 1990 s. Reappearing cyanobacterial blooms in L. Peipsi have caused <b>fish-kills</b> in recent years. In L. Peipsi summer/autumn fishkills during water-blooms are a straightforward consequence of reduced nitrogen level at remaining high phosphorus level while in L. Võrtsjärv the climatic factors affecting water level are more critical - at low water level winter <b>fish-kills</b> may occur. In L. Võrtsjärv nutrient loading has decreased and water quality has improved, present ecological status seems to be mostly controlled by climatic factors through changes of water level.

40|$|Piles are {{integral}} components of many overwater and in-water structures, providing support for piers and bridges, functioning as fenders and dolphins to protect other structures, {{and are used}} to construct breakwaters and bulkheads. While treated-wood and concrete piles are commonly used for construction of these structures, {{there is a growing}} trend toward the use of hollow steel piles. In the Pacific Northwest, several recently-reported <b>fish-kills</b> that occurred during the installation of piles have raised concern among Federal and state agencies charged with protecting aquatic resources. Federal concern centers primarily on implementation of Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Injuries to fishes inflicted by pile driving are poorly studied, but include rupture of the swim bladder and internal hemorrhaging. The mechanism of injury appears to be the intense underwater pressure wave generated during some pile-driving activities. The type and intensity of the underwater sounds produced depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the type and size of the pile, the firmness of the substrate and depth of water into which the pile is being driven, and the type and size of the pile-driving hammer. In general, driving steel piles with an impact hammer appears to generate pressure waves that are more harmful than those generated by impact-driving of concrete or wood piles, or by vibratory-hammer driving of any type of pile. Of the reported <b>fish-kills,</b> all have occurred during impact-driving of steel piles. However, conditions required to produce sound pressure waves that can injure or kill fishes are not presently understood. Recent reports of fishes killed during pile driving are producing changes in the way that such activities are being viewed by the Washington State Habitat Branch of the National Marine Fisheries Service during ESA and EFH consultations. These changes include requirements for hydro-acoustic monitoring of the sound pressure levels generated during pile driving, and, if maximum thresholds are exceeded, the incorporation of measures to reduce those sound pressure levels.

40|$|Major {{changes in}} estuarine water quality {{following}} flood events {{are influenced by}} the duration of floodwater-floodplain contact and the dynamics of floodwater recession as controlled by floodplain geomorphology. Episodic large-scale deoxygenation events causing mass mortality of benthic and aquatic biota can follow these events. This study examines the timing and sources of poor quality water entering a sub-tropical coastal estuary in eastern Australia following a flood event. The results have implications for targeted river and floodplain management to improve water quality. The Richmond River is a mature barrier estuary with a large floodplain to upper catchment ratio. The lower floodplain is characterised by extensive, well-developed natural levees grading into large backswamp basins. Prior to European modification of floodplain hydrology, these backswamp basins were semi-permanent wetlands and natural storage basins for floodwaters occluded from the main channel by the morphology of natural levee systems. Following a 1 : 10 year flood event, the Richmond River estuary was closed to commercial and recreational fishing due to a <b>fish-kill</b> event attributed to deoxygenation of 3 ̆e 30 km of the main channel. Floodwater samples were collected along the estuary for one month following the flood peak and aqueous geochemistry analysed. Upper catchment inflows to the estuary remained well-oxygenated during the event and therefore, were not the source of the deoxygenating water. The primary source of the deoxygenating waters during the flood recession phase were the major mid-estuary backswamp basins identified by their unique anaerobic geochemical signature. Large constructed drains, which alter floodplain hydrology, dissect the natural levees bordering backswamp basins to allow floodwaters to drain from the backswamps into the main river channel at an enhanced rate. Whilst lower quality floodwaters were previously largely retained in backswamp basins during the flood recession phase, these waters are now exported to the main river channel causing declines in river health...|$|E
40|$|This report Covers {{development}} of a model called MINLAKE 98, which combines Riley's (1988) lake water quality model with a year-round model of temperature and dissolved oxygen (Fang and Stefan, 1994). Once validated this combined model {{will be used to}} simulate· the effect of runoff from two rural watersheds on the water quality of several ponds in the watershed. For many lakes in the US, point source inputs (such as municipal and industrial effluents) have been monitored, modified, diverted, and modeled. Today, non-point sources are the concern. Current problems include changes in land use, runoff quantity and quality, and population density. The results are seen e. g. in Lake Sammamish, Washington; In 1968 wastewater effluent was diverted out of the lake decreasing the annual mean total phosphorus concentration by the late 1970 's. However, since the early 1980 's the total phosphorus concentrati 0 l 1 has begun to increase due to land use changes (Perkins, et al. 1997). An added dimension, is the effect of climate change has on runoff quality and the subsequent impact on lake water quality. Lake water, quality models which simulate year-round temperature and concentrations of phytoplankton, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, and silica) can be used to study changes in trophic status of a lake. Examples include predicting changes resulting from global, warming or different,landuse management, practices. For many lakes, noticable changes in the trophic state due to changes in management practices or changes due to global warming take more than a single openwater season to be observed. A model which includes simulation tlu'ough the winter icecover period can provide a prediction oftl~e following spring as opposed to an open-water model which requires re-initialization in the spring. Year-round simulation is also necessary for the prediction of long-term changes to a lake in response to changes in the watershed or due to climate change. Additionally, year-round models can predict anoxic periods during the winter which may be potential winter <b>fish-kill</b> events.

40|$|Lake Averno is {{situated}} in the homonymous crater in the northwestern sector of the Campi Flegrei active volcanic system in Campania region, Italy. In February 2005 a fish kill event was observed in the lake, prompting a geochemical survey to ascertain the possible cause. In February 2005 a geochemical survey revealed that the lake water was unstratified chemically and isotopically, presumable, {{as a result of}} lake overturn. This <b>fish-kill</b> phenomenon was recorded at least two other times in the past. In contrast to the February 2005 results, data collected in October 2005, shows the Lake Averno to be stratified, with an oxic epilimnion (surface to 6 m) and an anoxic hypolimnion (6 m to lake bottom at about 33 m). Chemical and isotopic composition of Lake Averno waters suggests an origin by mixing of shallow waters with a Na-Cl hydrothermal component coupled with an active evaporation process. The isotopic composition of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon, as well as the composition of the non-reactive dissolved gas species again supports the occurrence of this mixing process. Decreasing levels of SO 4 and increasing levels of H 2 S and CH 4 contents in lake water with depth, strongly suggests anaerobic bacterial processes are occurring through decomposition of organic matter under anoxic conditions in the sediment and in the water column. Sulfate reduction and methanogenesis processes coexist and play a pivotal role in the anaerobic environment of the Lake Averno. The sulfate reducing bacterial activity has been estimated in the range of 14 - 22 μmol. m- 2. day- 1. Total gas pressure of dissolved gases ranges between 800 and 1400 mbar, well below the hydrostatic pressure throughout the water column, excluding the possibility, at least at the survey time, of a limnic eruption. Vertical changes in the density of lake waters indicate that overturn may be triggered by cooling of epilimnetic waters below 7 °C. This is a possible phenomenon in winter periods if atmospheric temperatures remain frosty for enough time, as occurred in February 2005. The bulk of these results strongly support the hypothesis that fish kill was caused by a series of events that began with the cooling of the epilimnetic waters with breaking of the thermal stratification, followed by lake overturn and the rise of toxic levels of H 2 S from the reduced waters near the lake bottom...|$|E

However, the interactions between microbial, chemical, hydrodynamic and optical conditions necessary for black blooms are poorly understood. The present study combines field investigations and laboratory mesocosm studies to show that black blooms are caused by a combination of high CDOM (chromophoric dissolved organic matter) absorption, the formation of CDOM-Fe complexes and low backscattering.

The huge amount of nutrient loads from the human activities has modified the natural background of water quality in estuaries, bays and other coastal zones. As a result of elevated eutrophic status, coastal systems are subject to a series of negative and undesirable consequences, such as <b>fish-kills</b> and interdiction of shellfish aquaculture. While much attention is focused on managing this issue, there is a need to assess the eutrophic level in coastal systems and to identify the extent of danger. In this thesis, a variety of traditional Chinese assessment methods are discussed and compared with western ways, such as OSPAR COMPP and ASSETS. Afterwards, ASSETS was chosen to carry out two case studies (Changjiang Estuary and Jiaozhou Bay) due to its solid theory and successful applications. As a process-based method, it set up a pressure-state-response model based on three main indices, i. e., Overall Human Influence, Overall Eutrophic Condition and Future outlook.

40|$|In recent decades, {{aquaculture}} {{has become}} an increasingly {{important part of the}} world economy. Other than marketing concerns, the biggest challenge facing fish farmers is to control the many complex abiotic and biotic factors that influence the success of fish rearing. An example of the complexity involved in managing aquatic systems is the need to control opepod populations by manipulating the pond environment. Copepods play major roles in pond ecosystems, serving as 1) food for small fish, 2) micropredators of fish and other organisms, 3) fish parasites, 4) intermediate hosts of fish parasites, and 5) hosts and vectors of human diseases. Planktonic animals, especially rotifers, cladocerans, and copepods of the order Cyclopoida are the most important food items in freshwater aquaculture, and copepod nauplii are especially valuable for feeding fry. Copepods used as natural food are either cultured or collected from natural water bodies. Adult and advanced copepodid stages of cyclopoids are micropredators that target early life stages of cyprinids (Cyprinidae). Other copepods in aquaculture are fish parasites. The most common adult copepod parasites of freshwater fishes are Lernaea cyprinacea, Ergasilus sieboldi (and related species), Salmincola californiensis, S. edwardsii, Achtheres percarum, Tracheliastes maculatus, and Caligus lacustris. In addition, copepodids of Lernaea and chalimus larvae of Achtheres and Salmincola attach to gill filaments and cause epithelial hyperplasia and may be indirectly responsible for <b>fish-kills.</b> Copepods are also intermediate hosts for important fish parasites, including tapeworms and nematodes. Damage from these parasites may lead to fish mortalities or reduce the market value of the fish products. Finally, copepods serve as intermediate hosts for parasites that infect humans and can serve as vectors of serious human diseases like cholera. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

In locales where adequate disposal facilities are unavailable, or are unable to accommodate additional loadings of contaminated fish carcasses, concerns regarding human and environmental health are raised. During the summer of 2008, residents of the Lake Simcoe Region of southern Ontario, Canada, were faced with a massive die-off of carp, infected with KHV. Carp within the Great Lakes and much of the world are known to bioaccumulate (and biomagnify) contaminants, such as, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides (e. g., dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, DDT, and toxic metals (e. g., mercury). These contaminants have been associated with numerous adverse effects on both human and environmental health, and are thus of important considerations when planning for large-scale carcass disposal, following fish die-offs. Although suites of microbiological tests and water quality assessments are frequently conducted to identify causative factors during extensive <b>fish-kills</b> - assessments of relative contaminant burdens in the carcasses, which should dictate the most appropriate method of carcass disposal - are rarely performed. A case study on Snake Island, Lake Simcoe, Ontario was conducted to further examine the implications of this policy. Soil samples from two known disposal sites and three presumed control locations were sampled on Snake Island and sent to the Analytical Services Unit of Queen’s University for chemical analysis. Although none of the soil samples exceeded any legal guidelines in the present study, there is still concern as future die-offs of other fish species or piscivorous birds and the disposal of large numbers of carcasses may be an issue...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile {{salmonids}} inhabit a hypoosmotic {{environment and}} continuously lose salts by diffusion and gain water by osmosis. Even in recently hatched yolk sac fry (or alevins), achievement of hydromineral balance is by absorption of inorganic ions from the medium, possibly via mitochondrion rich cells {{on the body}} surface while excess water is excreted via the kidney. Alevins and fry drink freshwater, and although drinking has no obvious physiological function, it represents a route for water uptake, {{as well as for}} uptake of substances from the environment. Toxic substances in the water may enter directly via the body surface if they are sufficiently lipid-soluble, e. g. organic substances and unionised ammonia. Some toxins may inhibit ionic absorption processes in ion absorbing cells on the body surface, e. g. zinc, cadmium and the ammonium ion. Drinking represents another means of toxin presentation, with absorption via the gut mucosa, though little is known of this route, or its significance. Cyanobacteria (blue green algae) produce a variety of toxins in fresh water, including neurotoxins and endotoxins and one group of cyclic peptides, the microcystins which are hepatotoxins, has been extensively studied in mammals. Following ingestion, symptoms include vomiting and diarrhoea followed by damage to liver parenchyma cells, which may be fatal. There have been fewer studies in fish and long term-exposure of brown trout to microcys in resulted in reduced growth rate and liver damage (Bury et al 1995). Microcystins are not sufficiently lipid soluble to enter via the body surface, but may enter via drinking and transport mechanisms in the gut (Bury et al 1997). <b>Fish-kills</b> 8 sometimes occur during blooms of cyan bacteria though it is difficult to attribute mortality to a single cause. Mortality could result from deterioration of water quality often characterised by lowered oxygen levels, increased ammonia and pH levels, and toxins which may be released during senescence of the bloom...|$|R
40|$|The {{water quality}} of the River Dun and {{associated}} surface waters (a reservoir, two tributaries of the Dun, the Kennet and Avon Canal and the River Kennet to which the Dun drains) is described {{for a wide range}} of major, minor and trace elements. The water quality is determined by inputs from: (a) geologic sources (Ca, Sr concentrations and alkalinity) and (b) contaminant inputs from farming and sewage (Na, Cl, B, soluble reactive phosphorus and nitrate). As river water is mainly supplied from the Chalk aquifer and riparian areas, the water quality variation is damped, but there are occasional storms, where near surface/surface runoff delivers higher nutrient and suspended sediment concentrations, but dilutes determinands derived predominantly from geologic and point sources. River and canal water quality is also modified by in-stream biological processes in spring and summer, which remove nutrients (N, P and Si) and CO 2 from the water, bringing about precipitation of calcium carbonate and thus reductions in Ca concentrations and alkalinity. The biological effects are particularly marked for the Kennet and Avon Canal. The River Dun and Kennet and Avon Canal have been subject to episodic <b>fish-kills</b> and concern has been expressed about the role of event-based resuspension of bed sediments and mobilisation of dredged sediments on dissolved oxygen levels within the river. Therefore, fluvarium experiments on sediment–water interactions were undertaken to examine the potential effects of bed sediment disturbance on dissolved oxygen levels. The results of the fluvarium experiments demonstrate an ecologically-significant 30 % reduction in dissolved oxygen levels following bed sediment disturbance. This reduction in DO concentrations was greater than expected from calculations using the measured sediment-oxygen demand. However, it is not clear that the bed sediments are mobilized to sufficient extent in the field for deleterious loss of DO. Indeed, much of the resuspended sediments within the canal and the river may well come from runoff from the land. The results also demonstrate key hydrogeochemical processes in Chalk-fed surface waters, with implications for environmental management...|$|R
