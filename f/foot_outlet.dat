5000|$|The {{lake was}} {{originally}} {{an arm of}} the San Francisco Bay formed where several creeks empty into the bay. It was surrounded by 1000 acre of wetlands when the Ohlone people fished, hunted and gathered food along its shores. By 1810, the remaining Native Americans were removed to Mission San José and the estuary and 44800 acre of surrounding land was deeded to Sergeant Luis Maria Peralta to become Rancho San Antonio. After gold was discovered in 1848 in present-day Coloma 125 mi to the northeast, Anglo squatters led by lawyer Horace Carpentier took control of the East Bay area which was to become downtown Oakland, including the estuary known as [...] "San Antonio Slough." [...] In 1856, Peralta fought and won a United States Supreme Court case against the squatters but further court cases between his sons and daughters would greatly diminish their holdings. The Peralta brothers had to sell much of the land to Carpentier to pay legal fees and new property taxes. Oakland was incorporated in 1852 with Carpentier as its first mayor and the estuary became the city's sewer. Lake Merritt naturally had tidal flows via a broad 600 <b>foot</b> <b>outlet,</b> but this has been steadily reduced with development of the region after 1869. Currently the tidal flows are limited in size and managed for flood control. For years the lake acted as a waste collector. It was regarded as ideal for sewage because of its chemical contents, which have high acidities that cause it to decompose human feces at very high rates. Sixty miles of brick and wood channeling sent the broken down sewage {{to the bottom of the}} lake to then be eaten by bottom feeders. The stench at the lake during the decomposition of the sewage was a problem for Oaklanders on the west shore and residents of Clinton and San Antonio villages on the east.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background With Pennsylvania {{currently}} {{considering a}} {{move away from}} an Alcohol Beverage Control state to a privatized alcohol distribution system, this study uses a spatial analytical approach to examine potential impacts of privatization on the number and spatial distribution of alcohol outlets {{in the city of}} Philadelphia over a long time horizon. Methods A suite of geospatial data were acquired for Philadelphia, including 1, 964 alcohol outlet locations, 569, 928 land parcels, and school, church, hospital, park and playground locations. These data were used as inputs for exploratory spatial analysis to estimate the expected number of outlets that would eventually operate in Philadelphia. Constraints included proximity restrictions (based on current ordinances regulating outlet distribution) of at least 200 <b>feet</b> between alcohol <b>outlets</b> and at least 300 <b>feet</b> between <b>outlets</b> and schools, churches, hospitals, parks and playgrounds. Results Findings suggest that current state policies on alcohol outlet distributions in Philadelphia are loosely enforced, with many areas exhibiting extremely high spatial densities of outlets that violate existing proximity restrictions. The spatial model indicates that an additional 1, 115 outlets could open in Philadelphia if privatization was to occur and current proximity ordinances were maintained. Conclusions The study reveals that spatial analytical approaches can function as an excellent tool for contingency-based “what-if” analysis, providing an objective snapshot of potential policy outcomes prior to implementation. In this case, the likely outcome is a tremendous increase in alcohol outlets in Philadelphia, with concomitant negative health, crime and quality of life outcomes that accompany such an increase. </p...|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Vanity Fair {{opened up}} the first multi-store outlet center in Reading, Pennsylvania. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, outlet malls grew rapidly in the USA. A typical outlet mall in the USA is opened with between 100,000 to 200,000 square feet (about 1 to 2 hectares) of retail space. This can {{gradually}} increase to 500,000 to 600,000 feet (around 5 hectares). The average outlet mall has an area of 216,000 <b>feet.</b> In 2003, <b>outlet</b> malls in the USA generated $15 billion in revenue from 260 stores.|$|R
50|$|One species, Thalassema mellita, which lives off {{the southeastern}} {{coast of the}} US, inhabits the tests (exoskeleton) of dead sand dollars. When the worm is very small, it enters the test and later becomes too large to leave. In the 1970s, the spoon worm Listriolobus pelodes {{was found on the}} {{continental}} shelf off Los Angeles in numbers of up to 1,500 per square metre (11 square <b>feet)</b> near sewage <b>outlets.</b> The burrowing and feeding activities of these worms churned up and aerated the sediment and promoted a balanced ecosystem with a more diverse fauna than would otherwise have existed in this heavily polluted area.|$|R
50|$|The spring's outlet pool is {{contained}} entirely within Mammoth Spring State Park. The park {{is located in}} the town of Mammoth Spring, which lies in extreme north-central Arkansas. The outlet pool is adjacent to US Highway 63, only 500 ft. south of the Missouri border, and it can be readily seen from the highway. The spring's large discharge volume rushes a few hundred <b>feet</b> down the <b>outlet</b> channel before merging with the Warm Fork of the Spring River to form the Spring River. The cold water that emerges from the spring creates excellent trout fishing conditions and ample flow for water sports on the Spring River. Mammoth Spring was declared a National Natural Landmark by the Department of the Interior in June 1972.|$|R
5000|$|Miller {{was one of}} {{the first}} rappers to notice and take {{advantage}} of the retail potential of the music industry. As an investor, Master P {{was one of the}} first rappers to build a business and financial empire by investing in a wide range of business and investment ventures from a variety of industries. He has since invested the millions of dollars he made from his No Limit record company into a travel agency, a <b>Foot</b> Locker retail <b>outlet,</b> real estate, stocks, film, music, and television production, toy making, a phone sex company, clothing, telecommunications, a jewellery line, auto accessories, book and magazine publishing, car rims, fast food franchises, and gas stations. His sports management agency No Limit Communications, a joint venture with marketing guru Djuan Edgerton, was a success. His conglomerate company, No Limit Enterprises became a financial powerhouse. His real estate investment and property management company, the New Orleans-based PM Properties controls over 100 properties across the United States. According to Black Enterprise magazine, No Limit Enterprises grossed $110 million in revenue in 1998 alone. This level of success inspired other rappers to branch out into other business ventures and investments. Miller also has his own line of beverages, called [...] "Make ‘Em Say Ughh!" [...] energy drinks. [...] Miller has also made a foray into mass media, where he founded Better Black Television, a cable television network in November 2010 based in New Orleans, making him the first rapper to establish a cable television network.|$|R
