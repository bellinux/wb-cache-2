The modeling methods and dynamic stress analysis approaches are highlighted {{in order to}} achieve a compromise of the technical accuracy, computational cost and effectiveness requirements. The antenna launch-lock mechanisms with small clearance are modeled as equivalent linear springs (CELAS 2 's) by using the iteration technique.
