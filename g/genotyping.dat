5|$|<b>Genotyping</b> arrays {{designed}} for GWAS rely on linkage disequilibrium to provide {{coverage of the}} entire genome by <b>genotyping</b> a subset of variants. Because of this, the reported associated variants {{are unlikely to be}} the actual causal variants. Associated regions can contain hundreds of variants spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is a process to refine these lists of associated variants to a credible set most likely to include the causal variant.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the conceptual framework several additional factors enabled the GWA studies. One was the advent of biobanks, which are repositories of human genetic material that greatly reduced the cost and difficulty of collecting sufficient numbers of biological specimens for study. Another was the International HapMap Project, which, from 2003 identified {{a majority of the}} common SNPs interrogated in a GWA study. The haploblock structure identified by HapMap project also allowed the focus on the subset of SNPs that would describe most of the variation. Also the development of the methods to genotype all these SNPs using <b>genotyping</b> arrays was an important prerequisite.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these preventable issues, GWA studies have attracted more fundamental criticism, mainly because of their assumption that common genetic variation plays {{a large role in}} explaining the heritable variation of common disease. This aspect of GWA studies has attracted the criticism that, although it could not have been known prospectively, GWA studies were ultimately not worth the expenditure. Alternative strategies suggested involve linkage analysis. More recently, the rapidly decreasing price of complete genome sequencing have also provided a realistic alternative to <b>genotyping</b> array-based GWA studies. It can be discussed if the use of this new technique is still referred to as a GWA study, but high-throughput sequencing does have potential to side-step some of the shortcomings of non-sequencing GWA.|$|E

A notable shift from the Asian <b>genotype</b> II and Asian/American <b>genotype</b> to Asian <b>genotype</b> I and Cosmopolitan <b>genotype</b> was found, since all of the DENV- 2 strains were clustered into Asian <b>genotype</b> I and Cosmopolitan <b>genotype</b> (Fig.  3). <b>Genotypes</b> including Asian <b>genotype</b> II, Asian/American <b>genotype,</b> American <b>genotype</b> and Sylvatic <b>genotype</b> were not founded in imported dengue cases during the study period, suggesting a low prevalence rate of these <b>genotypes</b> in the regions communicating with South China.|$|R

Sanger sequencing method found that 7. 9 % patients showed mixed <b>genotype</b> before ADV therapy. In contrast, all 38 patients showed mixed <b>genotype</b> before ADV treatment by deep sequencing. 95. 5 % mixed <b>genotype</b> rate was also obtained from additional 200 treatment-naïve CHB patients. Of the 13 patients with <b>genotype</b> shift, the fraction of the minor <b>genotype</b> in 5 patients (38 %) increased gradually {{during the course of}} ADV treatment. Furthermore, responses to ADV and HBeAg seroconversion were associated with the high rate of <b>genotype</b> shift, suggesting drug and immune pressure may be key factors to induce <b>genotype</b> shift. Interestingly, patients with <b>genotype</b> C had a significantly higher rate of <b>genotype</b> shift than <b>genotype</b> B. In <b>genotype</b> shift group, ADV treatment induced a marked enhancement of <b>genotype</b> B ratio accompanied by a reduction of <b>genotype</b> C ratio, suggesting <b>genotype</b> C may be more sensitive to ADV than <b>genotype</b> B. Moreover, patients with dominant <b>genotype</b> C may have a better therapeutic effect. Finally, <b>genotype</b> shifts was correlated with clinical improvement in terms of ALT. Our findings provided a rational explanation for <b>genotype</b> shift among ADV-treated CHB patients.
