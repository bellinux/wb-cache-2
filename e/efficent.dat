Either for simulation {{on a level}} of atoms where every digit is important and inaccurary in computation can cause invalid result or numerical approximations in partial differential equations solving where a small deviation causes a result to be useless. The computations are carried over data types with precision of order hundred to thousand digits, or even more. This creates pressure on time complexity of problem solving {{and so it is}} essential to find very efficient methods for computation. Every complex physical problem is usually described by a system of equations frequently containing elementary functions like sinus, cosines or exponentials. The aim of the work is to design and implement methods that for a given precision, arbitrary elementary function and a point compute its value in the most <b>efficent</b> way. The core of the work is an application of methods based on AGM (arithmetic-geometric mean) with a time complexity of order O(M(n) _ 2 n) 9 (expresed for multiplication M(n)).
