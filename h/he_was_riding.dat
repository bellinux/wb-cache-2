5|$|René Pottier {{would not}} defend his {{title in the}} 1907 Tour de France, because he would commit suicide before, after {{discovering}} {{that his wife had}} had an affair while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> the Tour. Petit-Breton and Georget would start again in the 1907 Tour and duel for the overall victory, which would be won by Petit-Breton.|$|E
5|$|Vincenzo Nibali {{was also}} {{cited as a}} {{potential}} winner of the race, following a difficult season. He had struggled during the Tour de France and was subsequently {{thrown out of the}} Vuelta for holding on to a team car. He had therefore made Il Lombardia a significant target. Nibali had performed strongly in the other late-season Italian classics, while his team had shown its strength in supporting Diego Rosa to victory in Milano–Torino. Fabio Aru, who had won the Vuelta, was not present: <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> the Tour of Almaty instead.|$|E
5|$|As {{a prelude}} to his planned {{campaign}} in Greece, Philip went on campaign {{in the winter of}} 339 BC, against the Scythians living south of the Danube, near the river's mouth (in Dobruja). He defeated them in battle, taking many captive, and built a statue of Heracles to commemorate his victory. He then marched through the territory of the Triballi in a demonstration of force, which probably lay upstream along the course of the Danube. During a skirmish, he was severely wounded in the leg when a spear passed through it and killed the horse <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding.</b> Recovering from this wound may have delayed Philip's campaign in Greece, since he did not set off until the autumn of 339 BC.|$|E
50|$|In {{subsequent}} {{runs in the}} National {{he finished}} fourth in 1987 and 1988, second in 1989, and tenth in 1990. On each occasion between 1985 and 1989 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridden</b> by Dunwoody, and on his last appearance in 1990 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridden</b> by Peter Hobbs. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> retired after the 1990 Grand National.|$|R

5|$|Jabara next held {{a series}} of {{commands}} at various Air Force bases across the United States. He flew the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and later the Convair B-58 Hustler. In 1966, while on leave from service in Vietnam, Colonel Jabara was traveling with his family in two cars to their new home when his daughter crashed the car she was driving and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> in, killing them both. They were buried together at Arlington National Cemetery. In recognition of his contributions to military aviation, an airport outside of Wichita, Kansas was named in his honor. Each year the United States Air Force Academy alumni association bestows the Jabara Award upon an Academy graduate whose aerospace accomplishments demonstrate superior performance.|$|E
25|$|Rickard was {{involved}} in other incidents during his international travels. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> a train in India when it was bombed in a terrorist attack. He was also once stranded in Greece when the government closed down the country's airports during trouble with Turkey.|$|E
25|$|Warren LaRiche {{was tried}} {{for the murder}} of Benoris Toney. LaRiche claimed self-defense, saying that Toney had pointed a gun at the car in which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding.</b> An all-white jury deadlocked over his {{conviction}} in February 1967. LaRiche was acquitted of murder charges by a second all-white jury in December 1967.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Gillespie was {{involved}} in a traffic accident when the bicycle <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> was bumped by an automobile. He was slightly injured, and found that he could no longer hit the B-flat above high C. He won the case, but the jury awarded him only $1000, in view of his high earnings up to that point.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in Tokary to a peasant family where he {{finished}} elementary and high school. In 1929 he joined the military where he quickly advanced {{to the rank of}} platoon commander. However his official military career was cut short by an accident incurred when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> a horse. His left leg was paralyzed and he was released from the army.|$|E
25|$|The 1–206th FA {{suffered}} no {{killed in}} action during this second deployment, although Battery B had one {{killed in action}} from an attached Regular Army unit. SGT Jose Ulloa, of 515th Transportation Company was killed on 8 August 2008 when the LMTV that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> in was struck by an improvised explosive device during a convoy security mission in Sadr City, Baghdad. SGT Ulloa's platoon was attached to Battery B as a convoy security platoon {{at the time of}} his death.|$|E

25|$|While {{shooting}} {{on location in}} Mesa, Berg {{was involved in a}} fatal accident that resulted in the death of another member of the production team. The SUV <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> in collided with a John Deere Gator all-terrain vehicle driven by Nick Papac. Papac died three hours later. On August 8, 2008, Papac's parents Michael Papac and Michele Bell filed a lawsuit against the director, a driver, and the production company. The lawsuit was dropped in 2008. Filming resumed one day after the incident.|$|E
25|$|Byrd had a {{prominent}} role in the 2008 Warner Bros. documentary Body of War directed by Phil Donahue. The film chronicles the life of Tomas Young, paralyzed from the chest down after a sniper shot him as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> in a vehicle in Iraq. Several long clips of Byrd show him passionately arguing against authorizing {{the use of force in}} Iraq. Later in the movie, Byrd has a one-on-one interview with Tomas Young in Byrd's Senate office, followed by a shot of Byrd walking beside the wheelchair-bound Young as they leave the Capitol.|$|E
25|$|The Kennedy {{assassination}} spotlighted the bravery of two Secret Service agents. First, {{an agent}} protecting Mrs. Kennedy, Clint Hill, was {{riding in the}} car directly behind the presidential limousine when the attack began. While the shooting continued, Hill leapt from the running board of the car <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> on and jumped {{onto the back of}} the President's moving car and guided Mrs. Kennedy from the trunk back into the rear seat of the car. He then shielded the President and the First Lady with his body until the car arrived at the hospital.|$|E

25|$|Part of the U.S. 24th Infantry Division, Sergeant Libby was {{attempting}} to withdraw from Taejon after the Battle of Taejon when the truck <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> in was disabled by North Korean fire. Libby exposed himself to enemy fire multiple times to help wounded soldiers, before using himself as a human shield to protect the driver of another truck as they broke through the North Korean forces. Shot multiple times, Libby died from blood loss, but was able to protect a truck full of wounded men until they escaped to allied lines. For this action, Libby was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
25|$|The {{winner of}} the 2012 race, Robert Gesink, did not {{participate}} in this edition as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> the Giro d'Italia. For this edition, the UCI elected to reintroduce blood testing based on the biological passport, as USADA would also take care of pre-race testing, but no cooperation was established between the two agencies. The favorites for the overall classification have been deemed to be Tejay van Garderen, Haimar Zubeldia, Cameron Meyer, Michael Rogers (who won the 2010 edition and was making a come-back to the race), Thomas De Gendt and Francisco Mancebo, among others. Another rider to watch was David Zabriskie, who finished second in the general classification of the race on four occasions including the latest edition, without ever winning the top honors.|$|E
25|$|Such {{a victory}} {{propelled}} {{him into a}} different league of steeplechases, horses and trainers. Christopher Green was granted a passport in 1850 which may well mean <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> abroad. He rode, and won, often for 'Mr Carew' and Ben Land snr. {{and he is now}} mainly mentioned by the sporting press only when something out of the ordinary happened. For a while, though, Green had been wanting to set up a training establishment on his own account and so moved back to Littleport in the Isle of Ely (his father's birthplace) where 'he soon got the management of several steeple chase horses' but found 'it was easier to find stabling than a country to train over'. He soon made the acquaintance of Henry Jones of Aps (or Apes) Hall, Littleport which became a long-standing relationship of friendship rather than one of pure business. In the 1850s, Green and Jones, as co-owners, bought Tomyrus (foaled 1851) who had a successful flat and hurdles career. Prince Charlie, Camel, Hester, Avenger, Gownsman 'and other good horses' were all descended from Tomyrus and gave Jones fame and success.|$|E

500|$|At 18, Davidson {{participated in}} a tryout for {{aspiring}} eventers run by Neil Ayer and Jack le Goff, {{who were trying to}} build the United States team to an international level. He had talent, and according to LeGoff, [...] "He didn't know which diagonal he was posting when he came to me. Two years later, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> in the Olympics." [...] Davidson was chosen, and began training with the USET in a four-year, seven-day-a-week program in Gladstone, New Jersey.|$|E
500|$|In one scene, Reeves needed Price {{to shoot}} his flintlock between {{the ears of}} the horse <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding.</b> When Price {{realised}} that Reeves had ordered that an actual blank charge was to be used so the weapon's puff of smoke would be visible, he shouted, [...] "What? You want the gun to go bang between the ears of this fucking nag? How do you think he's going to react?" [...] However, Reeves insisted and, when the gun went off, the horse reared and sent Price tumbling onto the ground. Price was not hurt but he was extremely angered by the incident.|$|E
500|$|On February 3, 2015, Dirks {{died in the}} Valhalla train crash. [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>riding</b> home in {{the front}} car of his train, which his brother says he likely did to take {{advantage}} of the quieter atmosphere, when it struck an SUV at a grade crossing north of Valhalla, [...] south of the Chappaqua station. The train dragged the SUV while it came to a stop, loosening segments of the third rail that accumulated in the front car. Dirks, the SUV driver, and four other passengers were killed, making it the deadliest accident in Metro-North's history.|$|E
