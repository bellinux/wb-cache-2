5|$|At federal level, Hamersley {{is within}} the Division of Stirling, a {{marginal}} seat which historically has alternated between the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party. It has been held since 2004 by Michael Keenan of the Liberal Party. At polling place and subdivision level, Hamersley <b>has</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1972, the only exception being the 1983 election. In the 2001 election, the booth at East Hamersley Primary School was only won by the Liberal Party with a 0.3% two-party-preferred majority. Hamersley was in the Division of Cowan for elections held between 1984 and 1996.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{morphological}} similarities, the Sumatran rhinoceros {{is believed}} to be closely related to the extinct woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). The woolly rhinoceros, so named for the coat of hair it shares with the Sumatran rhinoceros, first appeared in China; by the Upper Pleistocene, it ranged across the Eurasian continent from Korea to Spain. The woolly rhinoceros survived the last Ice Age, but, like the woolly mammoth, most or all became extinct around 10,000 years ago. Although some morphological studies questioned the relationship, recent molecular analysis <b>has</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> two species as sister taxa.|$|E

5|$|Dermaptera is {{relatively}} small {{compared to the other}} orders of Insecta, with only about 2,000 species, 3 suborders and 15 families, including the extinct suborders Archidermaptera and Eodermaptera with their extinct families Protodiplatyidae, Dermapteridae, Semenoviolidae, and Turanodermatidae. The phylogeny of the Dermaptera is still debated. The extant Dermaptera appear to be monophyletic and there is support for the monophyly of the families Forficulidae, Chelisochidae, Labiduridae and Anisolabididae, however evidence <b>has</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that the former suborder Forficulina was paraphyletic through the exclusion of Hemimerina and Arixeniina which should instead be nested within the Forficulina. Thus, these former suborders were eliminated in the most recent higher classification.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{individuals}} with MS were advised against participation {{in physical activity}} due to worsening symptoms. However, {{under the direction of}} an expert, participation in physical activity can be safe and has been proven beneficial for persons with MS. Research <b>has</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> rehabilitative role of physical activity in improving muscle power, mobility, mood, bowel health, general conditioning and quality of life. Depending on the person, activities may include resistance training, walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi, and others. Determining an appropriate and safe exercise program is challenging and must be carefully individualized to each person being sure to account for all contraindications and precautions.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after his}} {{retirement}} from sumo there was speculation that Asashōryū would switch to mixed martial arts, {{and he was}} reported to be forming an MMA camp for Mongolian athletes. However, instead he became a businessman. Asashōryū had held business interests in Mongolia whilst still active in sumo, launching the family holding company as early as 2003. Based in Ulanbaatar and investing exclusively inside Mongolia, the company has assets in banking, real estate and mining. In 2012, his wealth was estimated to be between US$50 and 75 million. He is also active in philanthropy, establishing the Asashoryu Foundation which <b>has</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> Mongolian Olympic team, given scholarships to Mongolian college students studying in Mongolia and Japan, and donated English-language textbooks to schools.|$|E

In 2008, Coulter became the face of Jeans for Genes Day in Australia, a charity fundraising event organised by the Children's Medical Research Institute which sponsors investigation into childhood genetic diseases. Coulter <b>has</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> charity since she was in high school. She raised $100,000 for the campaign, including profits made from her nude photo shoot with Cleo magazine. Alongside recording artist Marcia Hines, Coulter became {{a spokeswoman for the}} annual Australian red ribbon appeal in November 2011, raising money in the fight against HIV and AIDS, and helping people with HIV. A month later, on 19 December 2011, she performed at the Pitt Street Mall in Sydney, as part of the Optus Celebrity Carols initiative to raise money for The Smith Family, a charity benefiting disadvantaged children and their families.

5|$|PTC {{was founded}} in 1995 by {{longtime}} political activist L. Brent Bozell III. Bozell is a prominent conservative activist who has, among other things, served as Executive Director of the Conservative Victory Committee, a political action committee that <b>has</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> election of dozens of conservative candidates {{over the past ten}} years. He was also National Finance Chairman for Pat Buchanan's 1992 presidential campaign, and later president of the National Conservative Political Action Committee. Bozell was succeeded as PTC President by Timothy F. Winter. Winter served as Executive Director of the PTC for three years prior to becoming president. Prior to joining the PTC, Mr. Winter's 20-year career as a media executive included positions with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and NBC. Until 2015 when his position was terminated, Dan Isett, Director of Corporate and Government Affairs of the PTC, represented the PTC on the Consumer Advisory Committee of the Federal Communications Commission.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of morphological characteristics and gene sequences <b>has</b> <b>supported</b> <b>the</b> basal {{position within the}} genus long suspected of D.regia, often regarded as the most ancient of all extant Drosera species. Its distinct morphology and unique relict characteristics, ones it likely shared with the common ancestor of all Drosera such as the operculate pollen, led early researchers to suggest its ancient position in the genus. The first cladistic analysis based on rbcL and morphological data confirmed these ideas and suggested that D.regia formed a clade sister to all other Drosera surveyed, with Dionaeamuscipula forming a sister clade to all Drosera. Further analysis in 2002 based on the nuclear 18S rDNA, plastid DNA (rbcL, matK, atpB), and morphological data confirmed these relationships, supporting the basal position of D.regia in the genus and its close relationship with Dionaea and Aldrovanda. New analysis in 2003 revealed a close relationship between D.regia and D.arcturi, both of which clustered basally with respect to all other Drosera, suggesting a link between D.regia and all other Drosera through its relationship with D.arcturi.|$|E
