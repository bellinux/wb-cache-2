40|$|Abstract. <b>Equal-loudness</b> <b>contours</b> were {{constructed}} from magnitude estimation judgments in 10 normal-hearing listeners. Equal-latency contours {{were constructed}} from auditory reaction time measurements in these same listen-ers. The stimuli were pure tones ranging from 2 5 0 4 0 0 0 Hz in octave intervals. <b>Equal-loudness</b> <b>contours</b> were in good agreement with those obtained by previous re-searchers, and the equal-latency curves were in good {{agreement with the}} <b>equal-loudness</b> <b>contours.</b> Auditory reaction time is the interval between the onset of an auditory stimulus and the initia-tion of a listener’s response. As the intensity of an auditory stimulus increases, the latency cf the behavioral response decreases. Reac-tion time and loudness show such a close rela-tionship that reaction time {{has been used to}} in-fer loudness perception in monkeys (Moody, 1970, 1973; Pfhgst et al., 1975).

Between 1 and 10 kHz, a linear matching function with a slope of 1. 0 gave a good account of the results. Above 10 kHz, the loudness-matching functions were curvilinear in shape. The data suggest that, from 1 to 10 kHz, the spacing between the <b>equal-loudness</b> <b>contours</b> is independent of loudness level.

50|$|In the {{measurement}} of loudness, for example, an A-weighting filter is commonly used to emphasize frequencies around 3-6 kHz where the human ear is most sensitive, while attenuating very high and very low frequencies to which the ear is insensitive.

50|$|The first {{research}} {{on the topic of}} how the ear hears different frequencies at different levels was conducted by Fletcher and Munson in 1933.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the type of {{reinforcer}} on auditory sensitivity and equal-loudness data were determined in the squirrel monkey. The monkeys, restrained and provided with earphones, were conditioned to depress and hold a bar down {{in the presence of a}} stimulus light and then to terminate the holding response after onset of a tone. In Experiment 1, the specified behavior sequence postponed electric shock; in Experiment 2, a food reinforcer was dependent on bar release during the tone. The shape of the auditory sensitivity function and the acuity level at each frequency were the same for the two procedures. The audible frequency range extended from below 0. 125 kHz (lowest frequency used) to 46 kHz. Sensitivity was maximum at 8 kHz. Latency of bar release following tone onset served as the basic data for constructing a family of <b>equal-loudness</b> <b>contours.</b> The type of reinforcer appeared not to be a determinant of either the shape of individual loudness contours or the pattern of family of equal-loudness functions. At the lower sound-pressure levels, the <b>equal-loudness</b> <b>contours</b> closely paralleled the threshold curves. At more-intense levels, the contours tended to flatten and depend less on frequency...|$|R
50|$|Fletcher and Munson first {{measured}} equal-loudness contours using headphones (1933). In their study, {{test subjects}} listened to pure tones at various frequencies and over 10 dB increments in stimulus intensity. For each frequency and intensity, the listener also {{listened to a}} reference tone at 1000 Hz. Fletcher and Munson adjusted the reference tone until the listener perceived {{that it was the}} same loudness as the test tone. Loudness, being a psychological quantity, is difficult to measure, so Fletcher and Munson averaged their results over many test subjects to derive reasonable averages. The lowest <b>equal-loudness</b> <b>contour</b> represents the quietest audible tone—the absolute threshold of hearing. The highest contour is the threshold of pain.|$|E
50|$|While most audio {{engineers}} {{are familiar with}} the A-weighting curve, which was based on the 40 phon <b>equal-loudness</b> <b>contour</b> derived initially by Fletcher and Munson (1933) the later CCIR-468 weighting curve, now supported as an ITU standard is less well known outside of the UK and Europe. Originally incorporated into an ANSI standard for sound level meters, A-weighting was intended for measurement of the audibility of sounds by themselves. It was never specifically intended for the measurement of the more random (near-white or pink) noise in electronic equipment, though has been used for this purpose by most microphone manufacturers since the 1970s. The human ear responds quite differently to clicks and bursts of random noise, and it is this difference that gave rise to the 468-weighting, which together with quasi-peak measurement (rather than the rms measurement used with A-weighting) became widely used by broadcasters throughout Britain, Europe, and former British Commonwealth countries, where engineers were heavily influenced by BBC test methods. Telephone companies worldwide have also used methods similar to 468 weighting with quasi-peak measurement to describe objectionable interference induced in one telephone circuit by switching transients in another.|$|E
40|$|A noise {{synthesis}} method with no external connotation is proposed. By creating atoms with random width, onset-time and frequency, most external connotations are avoided. The further {{addition of}} a frequency distribution corresponding to the perceptual Bark frequency, and a spectrum corresponding to the equalloudness contour for a given phon level further removes the synthesis from the common signal point-of-view. The perceptual frequency distribution is obtained by creating a probability density function from the Bark scale, and the <b>equal-loudness</b> <b>contour</b> (ELC) spectrum is created by filtering the atoms with a filter obtained in the warped frequency domain by fitting the filter to a simple ELC model.

40|$|Equal-loudness {{functions}} describe {{relationships between}} the frequencies of sounds and their perceived loudness. This pilot study investigated the possibility of deriving <b>equal-loudness</b> <b>contours</b> {{based on the assumption}} that sounds of equal perceived loudness elicit equal reaction times (RTs). During a psychoacoustic underwater hearing study, the responses of two young female harbor seals to tonal signals between 0. 125 and 100 kHz were filmed. Frame-by-frame analysis was used to quantify RT (the time between the onset of the sound stimulus and the onset of movement of the seal away from the listening station). Near-threshold equal-latency contours, as surrogates for <b>equal-loudness</b> <b>contours,</b> were estimated from RT-level functions fitted to mean RT data. The closer the received sound pressure level was to the 50 detection hearing threshold, the more slowly the animals reacted to the signal (RT range: 188 - 982 ms). Equal-latency contours were calculated relative to the RTs shown by each seal at sound levels of 0, 10, and 20 dB above the detection threshold at 1 kHz. Fifty percent detection thresholds are obtained with well-trained subjects actively listening for faint familiar sounds. When calculating audibility ranges of sounds for harbor seals in nature, it may be appropriate to consider levels 20 dB above this threshold. © 2011 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R
50|$|Meters {{have been}} {{introduced}} that aim to measure the human perceived loudness by taking account of the <b>equal-loudness</b> <b>contours</b> and other factors, such as audio spectrum, duration, compression and intensity. One such device was developed by CBS Laboratories in the 1980s. Complaints to broadcasters about the intrusive level of interstitials programs (advertisements, commercials) has resulted in projects to develop such meters. Based on loudness metering, many manufacturers have developed real-time audio processors that adjust the audio signal to match a specified target loudness level that preserves volume consistency at home listeners.|$|R
