5|$|On 13 May 1787 a {{fleet of}} 11 ships, which {{came to be known}} as the First Fleet, was sent by the British Admiralty from England to New Holland. Under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip, the fleet sought to {{establish}} a penal colony at Botany Bay on the coast of New South Wales, which had been explored and claimed by Lieutenant James Cook in 1770. The settlement was seen as necessary because of the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in North America. The Fleet arrived between 18 and 20 January 1788, but it was <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent</b> that Botany Bay was unsuitable.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of Nasser's Arab nationalism over the RCC was <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent.</b> The administration was instantly {{recognized by the}} neighbouring Arab nationalist regimes in Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Sudan, with Egypt sending experts to aid the inexperienced RCC. Gaddafi propounded Pan-Arab ideas, proclaiming {{the need for a}} single Arab state stretching across North Africa and the Middle East. In December 1969, Libya signed the Tripoli Charter alongside Egypt and Sudan. This established the Arab Revolutionary Front, a pan-national union designed as a first step towards the eventual political unification of the three nations. In 1970 Syria declared its intention to join.|$|E
5|$|Extraterrestrial {{technology}} could have profound {{impacts on the}} nature of human culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet {{for a wide variety of}} political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent.</b> Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology. He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the Industrial Revolution, which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order. Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.|$|E

50|$|Later, {{at their}} naval {{base in the}} Grand Duchy of Finland, now {{promoted}} to rear admiral, Kolchak is introduced to Anna Timireva (Elizaveta Boyarskaya), the wife of his subordinate officer and close friend Captain Sergei Timirev. The strong attraction between them <b>immediately</b> becomes <b>apparent.</b> Although Sergei reminds his wife that they took vows before God, Anna is unmoved and wants {{nothing more than to}} be with the Admiral.|$|R

With all the fine perceptions of the author, the novel is baffling, unsatisfying, vague, yet stamped with a certain genius that might, with more manageable material, produce a memorable work." ...|$|R
5|$|These flights covered {{performance}} tests {{such as we}} do on planes undergoing Navy tests. The very first flight exposed weaknesses of the Zero which our pilots could exploit with proper tactics... <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent</b> {{was the fact that}} the ailerons froze up at speeds above 200 knots so that rolling maneuvers at those speeds were slow and required much force on the control stick. It rolled to the left much easier than to the right. Also, its engine cut out under negative acceleration due to its float-type carburetor. We now had the answer for our pilots who were being outmaneuvered and unable to escape a pursuing Zero: Go into a vertical power dive, using negative acceleration if possible to open the range while the Zero's engine was stopped by the acceleration. At about 200 knots, roll hard right before the Zero pilot could get his sights lined up.|$|E
5|$|While {{covering}} another convoy to Malta on 12October, she {{was damaged}} by near misses from SM.79s based in Sicily. The damage to her aviation fuel system was not <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent</b> and she covered another convoy later that month. While returning to Alexandria, her aircraft attacked Maltezana seaplane base on Rhodes on 27October. Four of her Swordfish from 824 Squadron had been disembarked earlier and were flown to Fuka Landing Ground {{for a night}} attack on Tobruk harbour. The 824 Squadron aircraft distracted the defences with 250-pound bombs, while the 12 other Swordfish laid mines. On 28October, Eagle {{and the rest of}} the Mediterranean Fleet patrolled off the west coast of Greece for a few days hoping to intercept the Italian Navy if it supported the Italian Army in their invasion of Greece, but no contact was made.|$|E
5|$|An osteological {{examination}} of the bones showed them to be in generally good condition and largely complete except for the missing feet, {{which may have been}} destroyed by Victorian building work. It was <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent</b> that the body had suffered major injuries, and further evidence of wounds was found as the skeleton was cleaned. The skull shows signs of two lethal injuries; the base {{of the back of the}} skull had been completely cut away by a bladed weapon, which would have exposed the brain, and another bladed weapon had been thrust through the right side of the skull, striking the inside of the left side through the brain. Elsewhere on the skull, a blow from a pointed weapon had penetrated the crown of the head. Bladed weapons had clipped the skull and sheared off layers of bone, without penetrating it. Other holes in the skull and lower jaw were found to be consistent with dagger wounds to the chin and cheek. The multiple wounds on the king’s skull indicated that he was not wearing his helmet, which he may have removed or lost when he was on foot after his horse had become stuck in the marsh. One of his right ribs had been cut by a sharp implement, as had the pelvis. There was no evidence of the withered arm that afflicted the character in William Shakespeare's play Richard III.|$|E

Cases from practice are used to trigger reflection on common ethical issues where the best course of action may not <b>immediately</b> be <b>apparent.</b> The case presented in this article is an illustrative compilation and is not based on specific individuals.

50|$|In {{the opening}} scene, {{the body of}} a navy medical officer is found during a storm at sea and quickly {{determined}} to have been murdered. The team leaves to investigate at the scene, but McGee is late as a result of being with Adam, a middle school-aged boy he is spending time with through a Big Brothers Big Sisters program. When he arrives at the ship, he encounters his father, John McGee, a 4-star admiral. It <b>immediately</b> becomes <b>apparent</b> that their relationship is somewhat strained.|$|R
30|$|Bleeding may not <b>immediately</b> be <b>apparent</b> to the {{surgical}} team {{due to a}} number of factors, including increased abdominal pressure (pneumoperitoneum) or decreased venous pressure associated with the Trendelenburg position [21]. If the lacerated vessel presents postoperatively as a haematoma, initial management should be with local compression. The temptation to open or aspirate the haematoma should be resisted, as such a manoeuvre may inhibit the tamponade effect and could increase the risk of abscess formation. If the haematoma continues to enlarge, however, or if there is evidence of haemodynamic compromise, wound exploration is indicated [22].|$|R
5|$|In France, {{the action}} was infamous for a {{despatch}} supposedly sent by Dupotet and subsequently printed in edited form in the newspaper Le Moniteur Universel. The report, which was later used by Mends in his dispute with Seymour, claimed that Niémen had not only been largely undamaged before Arethusas arrival, but that Seymour had actually surrendered to the French captain before Mends arrived. This story, almost totally invented, was widely believed in France at the time. The effect on the Mauritius campaign of the defeat of Niémen was not <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent,</b> Hamelin's squadron remaining a menace to British shipping well into 1810. However, {{in the aftermath of}} the destructive Battle of Grand Port, the French, although the victors, were unable to repair their ships due to lack of naval stores and their effectiveness declined until they were unable to resist the Invasion of Isle de France in November 1810. This inability was directly related to the failure of all but one of the French frigates sent to reinforce and resupply the island to reach it, the others either captured or driven back en route.|$|E

25|$|Acromegaly is an {{alternative}} diagnosis. From photographs of Rachmaninov in the 1920s and his portrait by Konstantin Somov in 1925 (Figure 1), {{at a time when}} he was recording his four piano concerti, the coarse facial features of acromegaly are not <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent.</b> However, a case can be made from later photographs...|$|E
50|$|Early {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} discrepancy proposed that the models of the Sun were wrong, i.e. the temperature and pressure {{in the interior of}} the Sun were substantially different from what was believed. For example, since neutrinos measure the amount of current nuclear fusion, it was suggested that the nuclear processes in the core of the Sun might have temporarily shut down. Since it takes thousands of years for heat energy to move from the core {{to the surface of the}} Sun, this would not <b>immediately</b> be <b>apparent.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Immediately</b> after Cloudbase's <b>apparent</b> destruction, Symphony {{wakes up}} in the desert; she is {{face-to-face}} with Scarlet and Blue, {{who are part of}} the ground forces that have been dispatched to rescue her.

50|$|The P61's debut {{came at the}} French Grand Prix at {{the hands}} of {{champion}} Graham Hill. Hill stalled at the start and was given a push-start, earning him a 60-second penalty. A lucky Hill would finish the race 3rd, 61 seconds ahead of Jack Brabham. Although the result seemed promising, it <b>immediately</b> became <b>apparent</b> the car suffered from severe chassis flex without a bulkhead. The P61 would not return until Monza, where Hill would retire with clutch problems. Hill's teammate Richie Ginther finished 2nd in the older P57. With no immediate fix to the gearbox and chassis issues, BRM finished out the season with the P57.|$|R

25|$|The {{two most}} {{remarkable}} and accomplished poems {{in the manuscript}} are both long exercises in a late form of alliterative verse with a superimposed rhyme-scheme: Pater Noster and The Three Dead Kings. Some modern commentators have suggested that these poems cannot be by Audelay, as they show {{a very high level}} of technical skill not <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent</b> in other poems in the manuscript, but others have maintained that they were most probably Audelay's own work.|$|E
50|$|Then NCIS Director Tom Morrow (Alan Dale) {{announces that}} he is leaving the agency after {{receiving}} a job offer from Homeland Security and introduces Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly) as his replacement. It <b>immediately</b> becomes <b>apparent</b> that Gibbs was romantically involved with Shepard while working undercover with her years earlier, though she insists that she is now nothing more than his boss and will act accordingly. Gibbs clashes with Shepard, who believes that Ari Haswari was not the one responsible for firing the bullet that killed Agent Todd {{due to the fact}} that there's no physical evidence or proof of any kind linking him to the crime.|$|R
5|$|No. 4 Commando {{was formed}} in Weymouth on 21 July 1940, when the first intake of 500 volunteers arrived. The unique nature of the commandos <b>immediately</b> became <b>apparent</b> when every man was held {{responsible}} for finding his own quarters. As commandos {{were expected to be}} fighting troops, they had no administrative personnel, such as clerks and cooks for example. To assist them with living 'off camp', with no cook house all ranks were given a daily allowance and a ration card, the allowance being 67 pence for officers and of 34 pence for other ranks. This arrangement meant that commandos lived on civilian rations, {{while the rest of the}} armed forces had the more plentiful military scale of rations.|$|R
50|$|It <b>immediately</b> became <b>apparent,</b> however, that {{although}} Congress had authorized {{the expenditure of}} $250,000 for Memorial Amphitheater, it had not actually appropriated any such funds from the U.S. Treasury. This left the AMAC without any funds to conduct its business. It was not until August 1, 1914, that Congress finally appropriated money for the amphitheater's construction. Ten days later, Colonel William W. Harts of the United States Army Corps of Engineers was elected the commission's executive director. On October 12, 1914, the AMAC contracted with the New York-based architectural firm of Carrère and Hastings to design the building. The AMAC hired the George A. Fuller Co. to construct it on February 11, 1915.|$|R
25|$|Because islands on the Argun, Amur, and Ussuri rivers often {{split the}} rivers into {{multiple}} streams, {{the location of}} the main stream (and thus the border) was often not <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent.</b> Obviously, each country would receive a greater number of islands if the recognized main channel was closer to the opposite bank. Thus, the demarcation work was often controversial and subject to local protests over disputed territories. The demarcation work continued nearly up until its 1997 deadline.|$|E
25|$|Cauty {{stated in}} a music press {{interview}} that Blacksmoke {{is first and}} foremost an outlet for his anger concerning the September 11th Terrorist Attacks. Among the work so far produced by the Blacksmoke Organisation are limited edition prints of stamps known as The Stamps of Mass Destruction the Post Terrorist Modernist EP, and the Post-Terrorism Xmas Shop. The anger over 9/11 is <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent</b> in the samples and vocals of many of the original tracks as well as the graphics.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this shift}} was gradual {{and would not}} become <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent</b> until the Enlightenment. By the 18th century and the Age of Enlightenment, mention of {{creativity}} (notably in aesthetics), linked {{with the concept of}} imagination, became more frequent. In the writing of Thomas Hobbes, imagination became a key element of human cognition; William Duff {{was one of the first}} to identify imagination as a quality of genius, typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.|$|E

50|$|J {{arrives and}} it <b>immediately</b> becomes <b>apparent</b> {{that he is}} in fact the killer, as he {{arranged}} for a camera crew to be led to the remains of his final victim, Soo-yeon. Confronted with this, Lee then makes his own revelation, admitting that not only is he not the killer, but that he also did not write the book. In fact, it was Choi who wrote the book in an attempt to flush out the real killer, using his own detailed knowledge of the crimes. Lee turns out to be Jung Hyun-sik, who worked together with Choi to fake his own death and who underwent plastic surgery to assume a new identity.|$|R
50|$|In November, 2012, Turtle Island {{was forced}} to shut down public access because its {{traditional}} buildings violated building codes. In mid-December, 2012 Conway appeared to make progress toward reaching a resolution with the North Carolina Building Code Council. However, <b>immediately</b> following this <b>apparent</b> progress with the code council, Conway was arrested for trespassing on a neighbor's property {{in a dispute over}} the property border, continuing the legal challenges to Turtle Island.|$|R
25|$|One {{positive}} {{effect of the}} program which is not <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent</b> {{is that it makes}} {{a significant impact on the}} ability of the poorest families to eat. Children in public schools receive one free meal a day—two in the poorest areas—and so less of their family's limited income is needed to pay for food. In a survey of Bolsa Familia recipients, 82.4% reported eating better; additionally, it was reported to increase the incomes of the poorer families by about 25%.|$|E
25|$|On 18 April 1915, the Morane-Saulnier L of Roland Garros was {{captured}} {{after he was}} shot down behind the German lines. From 1April, Garros had destroyed three German aircraft in the Morane, which carried a machine-gun firing through the propeller arc. Bullets that hit the blades were deflected by small metal wedges. Garros' efforts to burn his aircraft failed to conceal {{the nature of the}} device and the significance of the deflector blades was <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent.</b> The German authorities requested several aircraft manufacturers, including that of Anthony Fokker, to produce a copy.|$|E
25|$|Each {{attribute}} has {{a number}} rating assigned to it. Normally they begin at 10, representing typical human ability, but can go as low as 1 for nearly useless, to 20 (or higher) for superhuman power.

Basic attribute scores of 6 or less are considered crippling—they are so far below the human norm that they are only used for severely handicapped characters. Scores of 15 or more are described as amazing—they are <b>immediately</b> <b>apparent</b> and draw constant comment.|$|E
30|$|Delayed Cerebral Ischemia: Defined as the {{occurrence}} of focal neurological impairment or a decrease of at least 2 points on the Glasgow coma scale (either in total score or one of its individual components).

2500|$|After {{arriving}} on the island, the player begins interrogating {{the citizens of}} Solstheim about Miraak. It <b>immediately</b> becomes <b>apparent</b> {{that a majority of}} Solstheim's population has been unconsciously enslaved by Miraak and forced to work on several runic monoliths called [...] "All-Maker Stones", scattered across the island. Among the unaffected observers is a wizard, Neloth, who directs the player to the Temple of Miraak. The player reaches the Temple and encounters a Nord named Frea, who is immune to Miraak's control, attempting in vain to break his spell over her people, the Skaal. She accompanies the player into the Temple. Inside, the player discovers a [...] "Black Book", and after reading it, is unwittingly transported into a realm of Oblivion called Apocrypha, where they witness Miraak planning his invasion of Tamriel. Miraak dismisses the player as inferior and returns them to Solstheim.|$|R

The workmen not appreciating {{the importance of the}} discovery cut a trench 2 feet wide through the middle of two of these burials, thus partially destroying the deposit. Further destruction was prevented by Mr. Ian Small, Civil Engineer of H. M.
