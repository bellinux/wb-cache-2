500|$|In {{addition}} to the numerous [...] "specific" [...] count-classifiers described above, Chinese has a [...] "general" [...] classifier [...] (...) , pronounced gè in Mandarin. This classifier is used for people, some abstract concepts, and other words {{that do not have}} special classifiers (such as 汉堡包 hànbǎobāo [...] "hamburger"), and may also be used as a replacement for a specific classifier such as (...) zhāng or (...) tiáo, especially in informal speech. In Mandarin Chinese, it has been noted as early as the 1940s that the use of [...] is increasing {{and that there is a}} general tendency towards replacing specific classifiers with it. Numerous studies have reported that both adults and children tend to use [...] when they do not know the appropriate count-classifier, and <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> but are speaking quickly or informally. The replacement of a specific classifier with the general [...] is known as classifier neutralization ("" [...] in Chinese, literally [...] "classifier 个-ization"). This occurs especially often among children and aphasics (individuals with damage to language-relevant areas of the brain), although normal speakers also neutralize frequently. It has been reported that most speakers know the appropriate classifiers for the words they are using and believe, when asked, that those classifiers are obligatory, but nevertheless use [...] without even realizing it in actual speech. As a result, in everyday spoken Mandarin the general classifier is [...] "hundreds of times more frequent" [...] than the specialized ones.|$|E

2500|$|To explain further, the {{question}} of whether a finitely additive measure exists—that is, preserved under certain transformations—depends on what transformations are allowed. The Banach measure of sets in the plane, which is preserved by translations and rotations, is not preserved by non-isometric transformations <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> preserve the area of polygons. The points of the plane (other than the origin) can be divided into two dense sets which may be called A and B. If the A points of a given polygon are transformed by a certain area-preserving transformation and the B points by another, both sets can become subsets of the A points in two new polygons. The new polygons have the same area as the old polygon, but the two transformed sets cannot have the same measure as before (since they contain only part of the A points), and therefore there is no measure that [...] "works".|$|E
2500|$|In many English-speaking countries, it {{is common}} to refer to {{physicians}} by the title of doctor, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not hold a doctoral level qualification. The word Doctor has long had a secondary meaning in English of physician, e.g. in Johnson's Dictionary, which quotes its use with this meaning by Shakespeare. In the US, the medical societies established the proprietary medical colleges in the 19th century to award their own MDs, but in the UK and the British Empire, where degree granting was strictly controlled, this was not an option. The usage of the title to refer to medical practitioners, even when they didn't hold doctoral degrees, was common by the mid 18th century. However, the first official recognition of Doctor being applied as a title to medical practitioners regardless of whether they held a doctoral degree was in 1838, when the Royal College of Physicians resolved that it would [...] "regard in the same light, and address by the same appellation, all who have obtained its diploma, whether they have graduated elsewhere or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi Phinehas, the priest, son of Rabbi Hama, {{interpreted}} God's hardening of Pharaoh's {{heart in}} light of [...] "But they who are godless in heart lay up anger; they cry not for help when He binds them." [...] Rabbi Phinehas taught that if the godless, for whose repentance God waits, do not do so, then later on, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> think of it, God distracts their hearts from penitence. Rabbi Phinehas interpreted the words of [...] "And they who are godless in heart," [...] to teach that those who begin by being godless in heart end up bringing upon themselves God's anger. And Rabbi Phinehas interpreted the words of [...] "They cry not for help when He binds them," [...] to teach that though the godless wish later to return to God and to pray to God, {{they are no longer}} able, because God binds them and bars their way. Thus after several plagues, Pharaoh wished to pray to God, but God told Moses in [...] "Before he goes out , stand before Pharaoh." ...|$|E

25|$|A notable {{amount of}} medieval {{literature}} is anonymous. This {{is not only}} {{due to the lack}} of documents from a period, but also due to an interpretation of the author's role that differs considerably from the romantic interpretation of the term in use today. Medieval authors often deeply respected the classical writers and the Church Fathers and tended to re-tell and embellish stories they had heard or read rather than invent new stories. And <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> <b>they</b> often claimed to be handing down something from an auctor instead. From this point of view, the names of the individual authors seemed much less important, and therefore many important works were never attributed to any specific person.|$|R

2500|$|STV {{differs from}} all other {{proportional}} representation systems in actual use in that representatives are [...] by the voters, and candidates of one party can be elected on transfers from voters for other parties. Hence, the use of STV may reduce the role of political parties in the electoral process and correspondingly partisanship in the resulting government. Unlike proportional representation systems employing party lists, voters in STV are not explicitly constrained by parties <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> exist; voters may ignore candidate party labels and mix their preferred candidate rankings between parties. Similarly, candidates may achieve electoral success by obtaining a quota of voters not generally within their own party, perhaps by winning transfers from moderates or by championing a specific issue contrary to party doctrine. STV advocates argue that, by requiring a candidate {{to appeal to the}} supporters of other candidates for their second and further preferences, it reduces adversarial confrontation, and indeed, gives a substantial advantage to candidates that broaden their appeal by being not only collegial but as open-minded and flexible in their principles as they can manage. STV detractors see that as a flaw, arguing that political parties should be able to structure public debate, mobilize and engage the electorate, and develop policy alternatives.|$|E
2500|$|The current Extradition Treaty {{between the}} United States of America and the United Mexican States (see 31 U.S.T. 5061) {{was signed by}} President Jimmy Carter in 1978 and {{went into effect in}} 1980. [...] Like many such treaties, it {{provides}} for the extradition of a party who has been charged with or found guilty of an offense committed in the United States, who has fled to Mexico. An offense is extraditable if it is a crime in both countries and punishable by incarceration for a period of one year or more. [...] In theory this allows for the extradition of child abductors who have absconded to Mexico as child abduction is a federal crime there. [...] In practice US authorities rarely request extradition in preference of Hague Convention litigation and, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> Mexico is not bound to deliver up its nationals. [...] If extradition is denied based on nationality, the request for extradition is automatically converted into a foreign prosecution pursuant to Article IV of the Mexican Federal Penal Code. [...] Although by law Mexican authorities are authorized to extradite their own nationals in “exceptional circumstances”, [...] in practice they most often will refuse to do so. [...] (See “Ley De Extradicion Internacional”, enacted May 19, 1897, revised [...] January 10, 1994: “extradition of Mexican nationals is prohibited except in “exceptional” circumstances”.) [...] “Nationality” is also liberally construed and often, marriage to a national, having dual citizenship, parents or other close relatives who are Mexican nationals, or simply having a Hispanic surname will suffice for purposes of extradition.|$|E
2500|$|The city’s {{markets are}} {{dominated}} by women, who make up {{nearly all of the}} buyers and sellers. Until the 1970s, there was a complete ban on men in this area, but this was relaxed at that time. Today still it is estimated that less than five percent of the people seen in the market are men. The historical {{reason for this is that}} traditionally women worked in the markets as men worked in the fields. Today still, men in the market can be subjected to taunts by the women who question their masculinity. The dominance of women in the markets, and the city in general in the daytime, made the city an interest starting in the 19th century. The writings of French traveler and historian Brasseur de Bourbourg and later by Mexican educator José Vasconcelos described Tehuantepec as a “matriarchial society.” Later writings would go as far as stating that the birth of a daughter was cause for celebration and men turned over their wages over to women. This depiction of the women of Tehuantepec focused on three facts, their dominance in the markets, the unreserved manner, often ridiculing men publicly, and the fact that they bathed partially nude in the local river. In the 20th century, painter Frida Kahlo would adopt Tehuana traditional dress as a kind of solidarity with these women. [...] However, much of women’s dominance seems to be limited to the market and household finances. [...] They primarily earn money through commerce and have the right to use this income as they wish, regardless of what their husbands or other family members say. However, men dominate city and municipality politics in Tehuantepec and other areas in the southern Isthmus. Women may participate in strikes, protests and other political movements, but they do not generally hold positions of power such as municipal president, or councilmember. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> they hold positions of lesser power usually related to education and health.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, the {{international}} community would have targeted weak states for territorial absorption or colonial domination or, alternatively, such states would fragment into pieces small enough to be effectively administered and secured by a local power. However, international norms towards sovereignty changed {{in the wake of}} [...] II in ways that support and maintain the existence of weak states. Weak states are given de jure sovereignty equal to that of other states, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have de facto sovereignty or control of their own territory, including the privileges of international diplomatic recognition and an equal vote in the United Nations. Further, {{the international}} community offers development aid to weak states, which helps maintain the facade of a functioning modern state by giving the appearance that the state is capable of fulfilling its implied responsibilities of control and order. The formation of a strong international law regime and norms against territorial aggression is strongly associated with the dramatic drop in the number of interstate wars, though it has also been attributed to the effect of the Cold War or to the changing nature of economic development. Consequently, military aggression that results in territorial annexation became increasingly likely to prompt international condemnation, diplomatic censure, a reduction in international aid or the introduction of economic sanction, or, {{as in the case of}} 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, international military intervention to reverse the territorial aggression. Similarly, {{the international community}} has largely refused to recognize secessionist regions, while keeping some secessionist self-declared states such as Somaliland in diplomatic recognition limbo. While there is not a large body of academic work examining the relationship, Hironaka's statistical study found a correlation that suggests that every major international anti-secessionist declaration increased the number of ongoing civil wars by +10%, or a total +114% from 1945 to 1997. The diplomatic and legal protection given by the international community, as well as economic support to weak governments and discouragement of secession, thus had the unintended effect of encouraging civil wars.|$|E
