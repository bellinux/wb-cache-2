The initial theoretical part is being followed by a practical part, including it's own research, dealing with digital divide problematics between <b>different</b> <b>age</b> groups in the specified region. In the theoretical part of the thesis, I discribed {{the phenomenon of the}} information society, information society and social exclusion, Czech information society, digital divide, gray digital divide and I also examined the specifics of <b>different</b> <b>age</b> groups. In the practical part of the work I dealt with the analysis of the digital divide problematics between <b>different</b> <b>age</b> groups in the specified region. After determining the objectives and description of survey methods for obtaining and processing data collected in the questionnaire survey, I dealt with analyzing the survey data, especially data relative to hypotheses set, describing the creation of digital divide between members of <b>different</b> <b>age</b> groups. In the conclusion, there were described existing conceptions in the European Union, in Czech Republic, and then were determined suggestions for specific procedures to eliminate the digital divide between <b>different</b> <b>age</b> groups...|$|R

5|$|Majungasaurus, being {{known from}} many well-preserved {{specimens}} of <b>different</b> <b>ages,</b> is well studied {{in regards to}} its growth and development. Throughout ontogeny, the skull of Majungasaurus (more specifically, the jugal, postorbital, and quadratojugal) seems to have become taller and more robust; additionally, the skull bones became more fused and the eye sockets became proportionally smaller. This indicates a shift in dietary preferences between juveniles and adults.|$|E

5|$|The find of {{a herd of}} six Psittacosaurus {{individuals}} {{killed and}} buried by a volcanic mudflow indicates the presence {{of at least two}} age groups from two distinct clutches gathered together. This find has been taken as evidence for group fidelity and gregariousness extending beyond the nest; the earliest such evidence for any ceratopsian. Even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their own food and may have been precocial. Another juvenile-only cluster shows that specimens of <b>different</b> <b>ages</b> grouped together. These juveniles may have associated together as a close knit, mixed-age herd either for protection, to enhance their foraging, or as putative helpers at the parental nest. There is no evidence for parental care.|$|E

5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the portraits on the Makkotai coins are {{that they do not}} have {{identical}} head sizes and some facial features also vary from one coin to another, even though they all have the same written legend. Such an observation has been made of coins assigned to the Western Kshatrapas of Gujarat, which are thought to be another inspiration for the Chera coins. Scholars who analyzed the varying portraiture on the Kshatrapa coins have advanced several theories to explain the phenomenon: that the coins could be of different kings who chose to keep the name of an ancestor on their coins or the coins all belong to one king with portraits depicting him at his <b>different</b> <b>ages.</b> Based on such theories, the Chera coins could either belong to a series of rulers or to a single king called Cheraman Makkotai.|$|E

5|$|As with {{previous}} games, the visuals of End of Ages were widely praised. The switch to real-time rendering was generally {{seen as a}} positive step. The game's music was lauded; GameSpot's review noted the use of music in End of Ages was sparse, but the little audio present set the proper tone for <b>different</b> <b>Ages.</b> A few reviewers, such as Charles Herold of the New York Times, felt that the graphics fell short of what was possible, especially compared to the prerendered visuals of Myst IV: Revelation. While Greg Kasavin of GameSpot felt that though the visuals were on par {{with previous}} games, End of Ages was missing several elements which made Myst IV more immersive; only important, story-driving items could be interacted with, for example, and the player makes no sounds or footsteps in the game.|$|E
5|$|Character {{creation}} is done through a tutorial prologue that encompasses the <b>different</b> <b>ages</b> of the player's characters, which also covers tutorials on movement, the HUD, combat, {{interactions with the}} game world, {{and the use of}} the Pip-Boy 3000. The character's {{creation is}} done in steps, with the player first setting up their appearance along with what race and gender their character is, and the name they have. Next, they customize their character's primary attributes via the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system – Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck – which is retained in Fallout 3, and determines the base level of the Skills the game uses. What three skills their character focuses on can either be left to the choices they make with a series of question, or by choosing manually what they desire. Character creation is not finalized until the player finally leaves Vault 101 and enters the Capital Wastelands, allowing players the option to modify their character's appearance, primary attributes and Skill choices if they are not satisfied with their choices.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued that all the {{specimens}} belong to the same species, A. lithographica. Differences do exist among the specimens, and while some researchers regard these as due to the <b>different</b> <b>ages</b> of the specimens, some may be related to actual species diversity. In particular, the Munich, Eichstätt, Solnhofen, and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts lined with forward-pointing teeth, and possible presence of a sternum. Due to these differences, most individual specimens have been given their own species name at one point or another. The Berlin specimen has been designated as Archaeornis siemensii, the Eichstätt specimen as Jurapteryx recurva, the Munich specimen as Archaeopteryx bavarica, and the Solnhofen specimen as Wellnhoferia grandis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In city, {{there are}} <b>different</b> <b>aged</b> people living there. Providing the {{ecological}} leisure service for residents {{is the essential}} function of cities. Studying the ecological leisure preference of <b>different</b> <b>aged</b> people can provide reference for the eco-space designing and constructing in the city. This paper respectively analyzes the preference degrees of <b>different</b> <b>aged</b> people in Changshu City to woodland, grassland, and water area, and analyzes the main time periods of <b>different</b> <b>aged</b> people taking their ecological leisure activities. The {{results show that the}} aged people prefer recreation in woodland; the middle-aged prefer recreation in water area; the youth and children prefer recreation in grassland. Comparing with other time periods, the aged, middle-aged, youth, and children respectively prefer to conduct their ecological leisure activities from 7 am to 9 am, from 7 pm to 9 pm, from 1 pm to 3 pm, and from 10 am to 12 am separately...|$|R
5|$|Limusaurus was {{originally}} {{described as a}} basal ceratosaurian, with both it and Elaphrosaurus being recovered as the most basal ceratosaurians in various phylogenetic analyses. However, subsequent research has placed it in the more derived group Abelisauroidea, specifically {{as a member of}} the Noasauridae. An analysis conducted in the study of multiple individuals of <b>different</b> <b>ages</b> found Limusaurus and Elaphrosaurus to group in the clade Elaphrosaurinae, within the family Nodosauridae. Nodosauridae was placed in a position outside Neoceratosauria, the group containing Ceratosaurus and Abelisauridae. The phylogenetics within Noasauridae, from the version of the analysis with separate specimens of Limusaurus, are shown below. It is notable that all the juvenile specimens grouped to the exclusion of adult specimens, showing that its anatomy changed significantly through growth.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{specimens}} of Pinacosaurus of <b>different</b> <b>ages</b> found that during ontogenetic development, the ribs of juvenile ankylosaurs fused with their vertebrae. The forelimbs strongly increased in robustness, while the hindlimbs {{did not become}} larger relative {{to the rest of}} the skeleton, further evidence that the arms bore most of the weight. In the cervical halfrings, the underlying bone band developed outgrowths connecting it with the underlying osteoderms, which simultaneously fused to each other. On the skull, the middle bone plates first ossified at the snout and the rear rim; gradually the ossification extended towards the middle regions. On the rest of the body, the ossification process progressed from the neck onwards in the direction of the tail. Young ankylosaurs are commonly found together but adults are found separate, suggesting they were solitary.|$|E
5|$|After a {{gestation}} {{of about}} 25 days, {{three to five}} young are usually born, although litter sizes vary from one to seven. Females may have up to six litters a year. Newborns weigh 3 to 4g (about 0.10 to 0.15oz) and are blind and almost naked. About as many males as females are born. The external ears (pinnae) soon unfold and on the first day, claws are visible and the young emit high-pitched squeaks. On the second day, {{they are able to}} crawl, and during the third to fifth days, the whiskers and eyelids develop. On the two subsequent days, the mammae and incisors become visible and the animals become more active. Between the eighth and 11th days, the eyes open, the fur develops, and the young begin to take solid food. Weaning occurs on the 11th to 20th day, according to different studies. Considerable variation is reported in body masses at <b>different</b> <b>ages,</b> perhaps because of geographic variation. Sexual activity commences when the animals are about 50 to 60days old. In the wild, rice rats usually live for less than a year; one study suggested that the average lifespan is only seven months.|$|E
