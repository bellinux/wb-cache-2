40|$|The {{study is}} based on 18 months {{intensive}} field-work during which 212 Australasian harriers were trapped, retrapped, measured, sexed, aged, individually marked and observed. Fortnightly observations of the individually marked population were made over a further seven months. The Australasian harrier and <b>European</b> <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier</b> {{are considered to be}} conspecific. Evidence is presented showing that there is no valid reason for considering Circus aeruginosus of the Pacific Islands to be a different subspecies from C. aeruginosus of Australia and New Zealand. During the breeding season ten territories in the 12 km 2 study area averaged 31 ha, nest sites averaged 910 m apart, pairs' overlapping home ranges averaged 9 km. 2 and favourite hunting areas 3 km, 2. A high population density of one bird per 50 ha was calculated. A low fledging success rate of 1. 8 young per successful pair and 1. 1 young per nest site, and two cases of polygyny were recorded during two breeding seasons. Territorial and courtship behaviour, nest parameters and the parental division of labour is described. Seasonal movements and the dispersion of all age and sex classes from the study area {{at the end of the}} breeding season are described. Most (66. 7 %) individually marked adults returned after the autumn dispersal phase and established winter home ranges averaging 9 km. 2. The home range of an adult female in open farmland was calculated to be 14 km 2 using radio-telemetry techniques. A non-breeding season population density of one bird per 80 ha was calculated. Communal roosting, which occurred throughout the year, is discussed. Four hundred and seventy food items were identified in the diet from pellets, prey remains, stomach contents and field observations. In descending order of numerical importance in the diet were mammals (46. 4 %), introduced passerines (29. 0 %), insects (7. 6 %), game birds (6. 7 %), birds' eggs (4. 8 %) and aquatic prey (4. 6 %). Australasian harriers ate significantly greater numbers of live prey than carrion annually. Adults took significantly greater numbers of agile food items than juveniles. Females ate significantly more large (> 200 g) and fewer agile food items than did males. Seven search techniques and five attack techniques, including some buteonine techniques, are identified and described in the Australasian harriers' wide range of hunting techniques. Ninety five attacks on prey are recorded and 15. 8 % of these were successful. Adults were significantly more successful hunters than juveniles. Co-operative hunting, hunting in the daily cycle, feeding behaviour at carrion, interspecific competition for carrion, interspecific disruption of hunting and prey escape tactics are described. From a computer analysis of hunting behaviour data it is concluded that adult males are more manoeuverable and less conspicuous than adult females and juveniles because they flew significantly lower and faster. Adult males also hunted, to a significantly greater degree, those habitats where there were greater numbers of agile prey. The hunting inexperience of juveniles was quantified. The Australasian harrier is moderately sexually dimorphic. Current hypotheses proposed to explain the degree of sexual dimorphism in raptors and why the females of most raptor species are larger than males are critically reviewed...|$|E

Birds accounted for 73 – 93 % of prey numbers in the <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> during the breeding season. Passerine birds were the most numerous during the nestling (63 %) and fledging periods (21 %), while ducks and gulls/terns had the highest biomass (29 % and 12 %, respectively).

40|$|As the {{evolutionary}} responses to environmental change depend on selection acting on individual differences, disentangling within- and between-individual variation becomes imperative. In animal migration research, multiyear tracks are thus needed {{to estimate the}} individual consistency of phenotypic traits. Avian telemetry studies have recently provided the first evidence of individuality across space and time in animal migration. Here, we compare repeatability patterns of routes and timing between two migratory birds, the <b>marsh</b> <b>harrier,</b> Circus aeruginosus, and the osprey, Pandion haliaetus, as recorded by satellite tracking. We found interspecific contrasts with low repeatability in timing and duration and a high repeatability in routes for ospreys, but the reverse pattern for <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers.</b> This was mainly caused by (1) larger between-individual variation in routes for ospreys (broad-front migration) than for <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> (corridor migration) and {{a higher degree of}} repeated use of the same stopover sites among ospreys, and (2) higher within-individual consistency of timing and duration among <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers,</b> while individual ospreys were more flexible.

40|$|We {{used the}} doubly labeled water (DLW) method to measure daily energy {{expenditure}} (DEE) in eight brother-sister pairs of free-living <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> (Circus aeruginosus) nestlings.

40|$|Abstract We {{investigated}} the water-crossing behavior of Western <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harriers</b> (Circus aeruginosus), mostly adults, and European Honey Buzzards (Pernis apivorus), mostly juveniles, {{in relation to}} wind conditions, time of the day, flocking and age classes, at a watchsite in central Italy during the autumn migration en route to Africa. Although European Honey Buzzards are less suited than Western <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harriers</b> to undertake long sea crossings, they were more in-clined to leave the coast when migrating in flocks. Few birds of both species chose to fly along the coast. Western <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harriers,</b> such as <b>European</b> Honey Buzzards migrating alone, under-took the water crossing rather than stopping migration (birds roosting at the site or flying back inland) during the absence of wind and vice versa during head winds. Conversely, European Honey Buzzards migrating in flocks were not affected in their decision (crossing or stopping migration) by wind direction. Both species undertook the water crossing rather than stopping migration during mornings and vice versa during afternoons. Finally, in both species, adults and juveniles showed the same behavior {{in front of a}} water barrier. This result was expected {{in the case of the}} Western <b>Marsh</b> <b>Harrier</b> but not from the European Honey Buzzard since, in this spe-cies, the water-crossing tendency is age dependent with adults avoiding sea crossings.

40|$|Loop {{migration}} among birds {{is characterized}} by the spring route lying consistently west or east of the autumn route. The existence of loops has been explained by general wind conditions or seasonal differences in habitat distribution. Loop migration has predominantly been studied at the population level, for example by analysing ring recoveries. Here we study loop migration of individual <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> Circus aeruginosus tracked by satellite telemetry. We show that despite a generally narrow migration corridor the harriers travelled in a distinct clockwise loop through Africa and southern Europe, following more westerly routes in spring than in autumn. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to identify potential feeding habitat in Africa. Suitable habitat seemed always more abundant along the western route, both in spring and autumn, and no important stopover site was found along the eastern route. Observed routes did thus not coincide with seasonal variation in habitat availability. However, favourable habitat might be more important during spring migration, when the crossing of the Sahara seems more challenging, and thus habitat availability might play an indirect role in the harriers' route choice. Grid-based wind data were used to reconstruct general wind patterns, and in qualitative agreement with the observed loop <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> predominantly encountered westerly winds in Europe and easterly winds in Africa, both in autumn and in spring. By correlating tail- and crosswinds with forward and perpendicular movement rates, respectively, we show that <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers</b> are partially drifted by wind. Thus, we tentatively conclude that wind rather than habitat seems to have an overriding effect on the shape of the migration routes of <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers.</b> General wind conditions seem {{to play an important role}} also in the evolution of narrow migratory loops as demonstrated for individual <b>marsh</b> <b>harriers...</b>|$|R
