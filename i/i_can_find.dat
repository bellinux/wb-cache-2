5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's death warrant. His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is not going to make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal way that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Titus Andronicus is by {{no means}} the most brutal of Shakespeare's plays. More people die in Richard III. King Lear is a much more cruel play. In the whole Shakespearean {{repertory}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> no scene so revolting as Cordelia's death. In reading, the cruelties of Titus can seem ridiculous. But I have seen it on the stage and found it a moving experience. Why? In watching Titus Andronicus we come to understand – perhaps more than by looking at any other Shakespeare play – the nature of his genius: he gave an inner awareness to passions; cruelty ceased to be merely physical. Shakespeare discovered the moral hell. He discovered heaven as well. But he remained on earth.|$|E
25|$|In Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927 (1995), a {{unanimous}} Court {{held that the}} Fourth Amendment normally requires law enforcement officers to knock and announce their presence before entering a dwelling. Today’s opinion holds that evidence seized from a home following a violation of this requirement need not be suppressed. As a result, the Court destroys the strongest legal incentive {{to comply with the}} Constitution’s knock-and-announce requirement. And the Court does so without significant support in precedent. At least <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> no such support in the many Fourth Amendment cases the Court has decided in the near century since it first set forth the exclusionary principle in Weeks v. United States.|$|E

When these things appear in Badiou's texts it is always allusively, with fragments of symbolism detached from the context that endows them with sense, and often with free variables and bound variables colliding randomly. No proof is clearly stated or examined, and the jargon of set theory is waved like a magician's wand, to give authority to bursts of all but unintelligible metaphysics.|$|E
500|$|His {{answer was}} {{that in many cases}} animals exist with {{intermediate}} structures that are functional. He presented flying squirrels, and flying lemurs as examples of how bats might have evolved from non-flying ancestors. He discussed various simple eyes found in invertebrates, starting with nothing more than an optic nerve coated with pigment, as examples of how the vertebrate eye could have evolved.

In response to his omission, Giovinco stated, [...] "I was upset.

[...] Cloke described her part as [...] "strong and sassy – in control. After the crash she comes unglued, probably more than any of the kids, and it's a quick, drastic change. I had to understand the psychology of a person who can turn on a dime like that".|$|E
500|$|The Boston Herald noted {{superficial}} {{similarities between}} System Shock and Doom, but called System Shock [...] "much more elaborate".

The paper believed that the game would [...] "set a new standard for computer games with its combination of action and puzzle-solving". The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said that the game [...] "is like a well-prepared hamburger—familiar stuff, but good to the last byte". The reviewer noted the game's [...] "somewhat clumsy control", but said, [...] "That, however, is all <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> to complain about.

500|$|This episode {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Monica Reyes, played by Annabeth Gish, who would become a main character in season nine. The character was developed and introduced due to Gillian Anderson's possible departure {{at the end of}} the eighth season. Although Anderson would remain on until the end, Gish later became a series regular. When creating the character, series creator Chris Carter wanted to give the character a personality who had much in common with both Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. At the same time, however, Carter wanted the character to be different from Scully's character in a way that Doggett was different from Mulder, saying, [...] "as much as Robert Patrick was unlike Mulder, we needed someone who was equally unlike Scully." [...] Gish later noted that, [...] "Chris really wanted Monica to be a sunny force, which is hard to play sometimes. But it's a natural instinct for me; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> happiness in the midst of darkness." ...|$|E

When they first met {{at the start of}} the voyage, Darwin had commented that [...] "My friend [...] is an ass, but we jog on very amicably". They walked into the countryside of St. Jago together, and Darwin, influenced by Lyell, found the surgeon's approach old-fashioned. They found a remarkable baobab tree, which FitzRoy measured and sketched. Darwin went on subsequent [...] "riding expeditions" [...] with Benjamin Bynoe and Rowlett to visit Ribeira Grande and St Domingo. FitzRoy extended their stay to 23 days, to complete his measurements of magnetism. Darwin subsequently wrote to Henslow that his collecting included [...] "several specimens of an Octopus, which possessed a most marvellous power of changing its colours; equalling any chamaelion, & evidently accommodating the changes to the colour of the ground which it passed over.—yellowish green, dark brown & red were the prevailing colours: this fact appears to be new, as far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> out."

500|$|In 1755, {{as part of}} the British {{military}} escalation, Major General Edward Braddock {{arrived in}} North America with a force of British Army regulars to head a major effort against the French in the Ohio Country. Washington wanted to serve on the expedition, but refused to do so as a provincial officer, since he would be outranked by even junior officers in the regular army establishment. [...] (Washington was said to [...] " [...] with fury when British regular officers expressed their disdain of provincial officers and soldiers", and at the realization that British officers were always senior to colonials regardless of rank.) Through negotiations mediated by Governor Dinwiddie, Washington was offered an unpaid volunteer position as one of Braddock's aides. [...] Washington accepted, writing to Braddock's principal aide, Captain Robert Orme, [...] "I wish for nothing more earnestly, than to attain a small degree of knowledge in the Military Art", and that the position would provide him [...] "a good opportunity ... of forming an acquaintance which may be serviceable hereafter, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> it worth while pushing my Fortune in the Military way." ...|$|E
500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story.
