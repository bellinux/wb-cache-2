The total area under experiment about 4000 m 2 was divided into two equal portions. One portion about 40 m X 50 m was occupied by drip and the other portion about 40 m X 50 m by <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>method.</b> Soil at the experimental site was clay loam in texture for 0 - 60 cm depth; average dry bulk density and field capacity was 1. 16 g/cm 3 and 28. 5 % respectively. The results reveal that the drip irrigation method saved 56. 4 % water and gave 22 % more yield as compared to that of <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>method.</b> Higher water use efficiency about 4. 87 was obtained in drip irrigation method; whereas lower water used efficiency about 1. 66 was obtained in <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>method.</b> The present study suggests farming community to adopt drip irrigation method instead of old traditional flooding <b>methods.</b> Keywords—Drip and <b>furrow</b> irrigations <b>methods,</b> water saving, yield of tomato crop...|$|R
40|$|Water {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of the scarce inputs, which can severely restrict agricultural production and productivity unless it is carefully conserved and managed. It is a wide-ranging practice using every drop of water for crop production through suitable irrigation practices. Hence, a field experiment was conducted at Axum area (Northern Ethiopia) during the dry season of 2013 to 2014 using drip and <b>furrow</b> <b>methods</b> of irrigation to evaluate the effect of irrigation methods in combination with and without deficit irrigation practices on yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of onion under drip and surface method of irrigation. Four irrigation treatments viz., drip irrigation at 100, 80 and 60 % crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and full furrow irrigation. Drip irrigation at 100 % ETc gave significantly higher onion yield (28. 0 t ha- 1), as compared to 80 and 60 % ETc and furrow irrigation treatments. The onion irrigated at 100 % ETc with drip method also registered 32. 8 % of increase in yield over <b>furrow</b> <b>method</b> of irrigation. However, irrigation water use efficiency was found highest (7. 60 kg m- 3) with drip irrigation at 60 % ETc and lowest (4. 75 kg m- 3) with furrow irrigation. The amount of water saved at 100, 80 and 60 % ETc under drip method was 29. 4, 43. 5 and 57. 6 % respectively over <b>furrow</b> <b>method</b> and this would be sufficient to irrigate 0. 42 to 1. 36 a hectare of additional area of onion crop in which this earns better economic returns as compared to that of <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>method.</b> Therefore, the study suggests farmers in the semi-arid conditions, having limited amount of water for irrigation, should adopt drip irrigation method instead of surface irrigation methods...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} at the research station of Sindh Agriculture University Tandojam where four irrigation methods installed during 2000 were utilized. The irrigation methods included traditional flooding (through basins and furrows) and micro irrigation (through trickle and sprinklers). The soil samples were collected at 0. 3, 0. 6, 0. 9 and 1. 2 m depths for nitrate nitrogen analysis. The results from two-year study showed high NO 3 -N concentrations at all sampling depths under basin and <b>furrow</b> <b>methods,</b> which {{could be attributed to}} free percolating water under these methods. In contrast, the NO 3 -N concentrations remained concentrated only in the top 0. 3 and 0. 6 m depths under trickle and sprinkler irrigation methods due to insignificant water movement towards deeper depths. The results further demonstrate that the NO 3 -N concentrations exceeded the threshold limit (i. e. 10 mg l- 1 set by EPA) under basin and <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>methods</b> but remained below the threshold limit under trickle and sprinkler irrigation methods, at 1. 2 -m depth.

Solar pump {{may be an}} alternative to the electric motor operated pumps for irrigated crop production in the country, especially for the off-grid rural areas. This paper presents the technical and economic suitability of solar pump irrigations of rice and non-rice (upland) crop productions in Bangladesh. Four solar pumps (submersible type, 1, 050 Wp) were installed in different locations for irrigating rice, wheat and vegetables. The solar pumps were used for drip irrigation and furrow irrigation for cultivation of brinjal and tomato during the winter seasons of 2010 - 2011, 2011 - 2012 and 2012 - 2013. There were no significant differences of yields of brinjal between drip and furrow irrigations in the year 2010 - 2011 in Gazipur and during 2011 - 2012 in Jamalpur. But in 2012 - 2013, significantly higher yield of brinjal was obtained from drip irrigated plots (43. 9 t/ha) compared to the furrow irrigated plots (38. 6 t/ha). There {{was no significant difference between}} drip and <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>methods</b> in Jamalpur in terms of tomato yield. Significantly higher yields of tomato were recorded in Gazipur from drip irrigated plots than those of furrow irrigated plots in both the year 2011 - 2012 and 2012 - 2013. Water savings by drip irrigation over furrow irrigation for brinjal and tomato were 53. 3 % and 56. 2 %, respectively.

Four plots of Midland grain sorghum were irrigated with portable sprinkler lines and four with gated pipe and furrows. Cultural practices {{were the same}} for all plots with the exception that the sprinkler plots did not receive any cultivation at the time of furrowing the plots to be furrow irrigated. The results obtained were: Runoff losses on the sprinkler plots averaged 0. 5 per cent of the water applied. On the furrow plots 6. 67 per cent of applied water ran off. Evaporation and deep percolation were assumed to be the difference between runoff loss and total water loss. These combined losses were 16. 8 per cent of the water applied on sprinkler plots and 19. 1 per cent of the applied water on furrow plots. The water application efficiency on sprinkler plots averaged 82. 7 per cent as compared to an average of 74. 2 per cent on furrow irrigated plots. The water storage efficiency on furrow irrigated plots averaged 93. 0 per cent as compared to an average of 88. 5 per cent on sprinkler plots. Water distribution efficiencies provide a direct means of comparing areas within a plot or corresponding areas of different plots to determine uniformity of water application. The average distribution efficiency lengthwise of the plots varied from 8. 2 percentage points on sprinkler plots as compared to 38. 9 percentage points on furrow irrigated plots. The average distribution efficiency across the plots varied from 8. 1 percentage points on furrow irrigated plots to 12. 7 percentage points on sprinkler plots.

Total irrigation water requirement (applied water) were 731 and 714 mm under drip irrigation, 881 and 871 mm under furrow irrigation in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Water use efficiencies (WUE) were 12. 92, 12. 14, 9. 38 and 7. 90 kg/m 3 for drip-grafted, drip-ungrafted, furrow-grafted and furrow-ungrafted treatments, respectively. Monthly soil samplings indicated that the salinity distribution decreased towards the root zone (wetted area beneath the emitters and plants) with drip irrigation and increased towards the root zone (furrow ridges and plants) with furrow irrigation...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of an irrigation survey method for digging up reli-able information to estimate application losses. A sample of 220 tertiary channels was drawn randomly to get information from the growers of the Mirpurkhas subdivision, Jamrao canal irrigation scheme. Pre and post soil moisture status based practical measurements of losses were also carried out at 20 different sites. The results showed that the irrigation methods and soil types have a pronounced effect on application losses whereas crop type has no effect on application efficiency. Drip, sprinkler and <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>methods</b> showed better performance as compared to other methods (wild flooding, border and basin) used in the study area. The survey based losses results were validated against measured losses whilst values available in literature compared favorably. The overall application losses in the study area were calculated as 23 %. The main assumption for the irrigation survey of knowing the irrigation depth (not target depth in accordance with crop actual demand) and cutoff time for a single irrigation event by farmers was almost fulfilled. Based on the encouraging results of this study, it is concluded that irrigation survey studies are useful in understanding the irrigation scheme losses pattern which in turn provide opportunities for improvement...|$|R
40|$|In this {{technical}} study, a new {{irrigation method}} called Water Pillow (WP) was introduced. This new method {{was a combination}} of both drip and <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>methods.</b> The main components of WP were portable plastic pipe and lateral. The plastic pipe was made from durable flexible polyethylene plastic material. The plastic pipe was pierced from the bottom sides with usually 1 mm hole. The diameter of the pipe, design and inter spacing of the holes depends on row spacing, crop and soil types. The length of plastic pipe can be arranged as the length of row. For irrigation practice, the plastic pipe was laid over soil surface between rows throughout the row length and its end was tied up then the water was filled throughout the lateral from the top part of the plastic pipe, the plastic pipe was tied up again. Water in the pipe infiltrates into soil in both vertical and horizontal directions like a drip irrigation method. The WP method does not need external energy for irrigation operation as compared to pressurized irrigation systems. The pipe remains over row space from first irrigation till harvest. On the other hand, the method has also some advantages such as preventing erosion, run off and weed control as well as efficient use of water and labor and it may also provide more crop yields...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of NPK inorganic fertilizer treatment on the proximate {{composition of the}} leaves of Ocimum gratissimum (L.) and Gongronema latifolium (Benth) was investigated. Cultivated O. gratissimum and G. latifolium were treated with NPK (15 : 15 : 15) fertilizer at 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 kg h - 1 treatment levels in planting buckets derived using the <b>furrow</b> slice <b>method</b> two months after seedling emergence. No fertilizer treatment served as control. The leaves of the plants were harvested for analysis one month after treatment. The leaf {{was used for the}} analysis because it the most eaten part. Fertilizer treatment significantly (p< 0. 05) increased the dry matter, moisture content, ash, crude protein, crude fibre, crude fat contents of the leaves of both plants. On the other hand, fertilizer treatment significantly, (p< 0. 05) decreased the carbohydrate and the calorific value of the leaves of the plants. The increase in the concentrations of these substances as a result of fertilizer of fertilizer treatment might be due to the role of fertilizer in chlorophyll content of plant’s leaves, which in turn enhanced the process of photosynthesis leading to increased synthesis of these substances. The decrease in the carbohydrate content might be due to its conversion to other materials in the plants. The results obtained were discussed in line with current literatures...|$|R
40|$|Water deficit {{associate}} with salinity in irrigation {{water is the}} major limiting factor in the Center and East of Iran region. Nevertheless, an experiment was conducted in 2005 at Esfahan National Salinity Research. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate effect of cropping methods and salinity stress on wheat agronomic characteristics. A Split plot layout within Randomized Complete Block Design with four replication were used. Irrigation quality water irrigation were in main plot, it consists in 4, 8 and 12 dS m - 1 and cropping methods were in sub plots that inclusive of traditional cropping, 60 cm furrow, 80 cm furrow and aside sloping 80 cm furrow with double row planting. The results showed effect of raising salinity stress on 1000 grain weight, protein yield, grain yield, biological yield, straw yield and harvest index were decreased significantly. Effect of cropping methods on protein yield, biological yield and straw yield were more significantly. While, the highest amount of the traits agronomic were in 60 cm <b>furrow</b> cropping <b>method,</b> whereas the lowest the agronomic characteristics were in traditional cropping method with the exception of protein yield that lowest was in aside slopping 80 cm furrow. The effect of cropping methods on 1000 grain weight and harvest index were not significantly. According this study the suitable method with the highest traits agronomy in salinity stress was 80 cm method. While, the traditional cropping method did not recommended in high salinity stress condition...|$|R
40|$|This study {{critically}} {{assessed the}} influence of frequent availability of water i. e. drip irrigation and mulch on optimum leaf area development of potato that control light interception and soil moisture conservation. Crop growth was stimulated in terms of early pick up of leaf areas that quickly covered the ground and improved transpiration efficiency. Drip irrigation increased water use efficiency three times as compared with <b>furrow</b> irrigation (conventional <b>method</b> of irrigation). Black Polyethylene mulch (25 µm) conserved soil moisture, raised soil temperature by 9 o C, stimulated shoot, solon and root growth, increased the total tuber number and yield but reduced the grade of tubers. Drip irrigation may prove a viable tool for source-sink alteration; stimulating early stolon initiation combined with ability to quick ground cover and sustained leaf growth for new tuber initiation for seed production as well as extended tuber bulking of early formed tubers for obtaining maximum yield with 50 % saving of irrigation water and efficient use of nitrogen fertilizer. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Contamination of {{groundwater}} {{is a great}} concern in many irrigated areas of the world. In irrigated areas of world, about 90 % of land is irrigated with <b>furrow</b> irrigation <b>method.</b> It {{is said to be}} water use efficient method than the conventional methods but is said to be capable of leaching large quantities of nitrogen to the groundwater. It is said that about 40 % of the nitrogen applied percolate below the vadose zone of a clay loam soil which can even more leach from sandy soils. HYDRUS- 2 D model was used to analyse different fertilizer placement strategies in the furrow in order to reduce nitrogen leaching from a furrows prepared in different soil textures. Strategies of soil management included controlled or normal (Sn), compacting furrow bottom (Sc) and covering bottom of furrow with plastic sheet (Sp). Soils used for analysis consisted, sandy loam, loam and clay. Considered placements of fertilizer included fertilizer at the sides and bottom of furrow (P 1) near ridge the ridge top (P 2). Results of simulations obtained with HYDRUS showed that for the considered soil textures 25 % to 60 % water can be saved Sc, which can further be enhanced from 50 % to 95 % using Sp. Simulated results revealed that 15 % to 99 % nitrogen leaching can be reduced by using fertilizer placement P 2. About 10 % to 98 % reduction in nitrogen leaching can be achieved if we adopt soil management strategies reported in this study.
