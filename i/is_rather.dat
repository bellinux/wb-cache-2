5|$|Although {{its orbit}} <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> {{different}} from those of the main two groups, it is possible that the comet of 1680 is also related to the Kreutz sungrazers via a fragmentation many orbits ago.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} {{viewpoints}} is at Minsterworth at the Severn Bore Inn on the A48. Another good place to see the spectacle is Over Bridge, but the view here <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> restricted by the adjacent railway bridge.|$|E
5|$|The Church of St Nicholas lies in {{the centre}} of Sapareva Banya. Its {{architecture}} <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> simple, with a single nave, a single apse and no narthex present. The church follows the Byzantine cross-in-square design, with unusually short arms of equal size. The dome has twelve sides and is of no particular height, though it <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> large for the church's size. The apse is situated on the church's eastern side; its shape is semicircular and it features a window. The entrance {{is located on the}} west wall.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 24-27 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> glossy ochreous-fuscous, {{with a faint}} purple tinge. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> light-fuscous.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark fuscous, slightly purplish tinged and the terminal edge is dark fuscous. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark grey.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 9 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark purple-grey with a cloudy darker {{spot on the}} end of the cell. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark bronzy-fuscous.|$|R
50|$|Climbing routes on {{the various}} buttresses range from E2 to V Diff. Access paths can <b>be</b> <b>rather</b> {{overgrown}} and even finding {{the bottom of the}} routes can <b>be</b> <b>rather</b> difficult.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 16 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> light glossy grey with the discal stigmata moderately large, cloudy and dark grey. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> thinly scaled and light grey.|$|R
5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back {{and bottom of the}} eye socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top of the eye socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of the}} jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium-247 can {{maintain}} chain reaction both in a thermal-neutron {{and in a}} fast-neutron reactor, however, its production <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> complex and thus the availability is much lower than its critical mass, which is about 75.7kg for a bare sphere, 41.2kg with a water reflector and 35.2kg with a steel reflector (30cm thickness).|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites spiral {{into the}} wind like a kestrel. They soar with {{v-shaped}} up-curved wings, the primaries slightly spread and the tail widely fanned. In level flight progress <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> indirect. Their flight pattern {{has been described as}} 'winnowing' with soft steady beats interspersed with long glides on angled wings. They can most often be seen hovering with wings curved and tail pointing down.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 23-24 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark purplish-fuscous, strewn throughout {{with fine}} pale ochreous-fuscous strigulae {{and with a}} dark fuscous discal dot at three-fifths. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark fuscous.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> elongate and pale greyish-ochreous, with some scattered fuscous and blackish specks and markings formed of dense blackish-fuscous irroration. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 16-17 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark fuscous, {{slightly and}} irregularly whitish-sprinkled {{and with a}} small white discal dot at three-fifths and a dark fuscous terminal line. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark fuscous.|$|R
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is {{native to}} {{tropical}} northern and central South America. It {{is present in the}} drainages of the Orinoco River, the São Francisco River and the Amazon River, and {{the upper reaches of the}} Paraná River and the Paraguay River. The countries in which it is found include Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. The range of this species <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> larger than that of the sympatric smooth-fronted caiman, as it extends into Paraguay and includes a larger area of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bromine is very {{reactive}} {{and thus}} {{does not occur}} free in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt. While it <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br−) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth of that of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Extremists will {{probably}} deplore {{the fact that}} the composer is still a respecter of form, still a devotee of beauty, still a believer in the potency of melody; but this <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> a matter for congratulation than regret... Mr. Sibelius is a fine musical constructionist, an eloquent harmonist and a fine colorist despite his fondness for dark tints.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 14 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark purplish-fuscous with an oblique ochreous-whitish strigula on the costa at four-fifths, where a faint line of scales is indicated to the tornus. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 19 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark brown with the costal edge suffused with fulvous-ochreous on the median third and with two blackish dots transversely {{placed on the}} end of the cell. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark grey.|$|R

5|$|For example, rhenium diboride can be {{produced}} at ambient pressures, but <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> expensive because of rhenium. The hardness of ReB2 exhibits considerable anisotropy because of its hexagonal layered structure. Its value is {{comparable to that of}} tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, titanium diboride or zirconium diboride.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} hall, {{the members of}} the town council decide that it <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> hasty to come to a {{decision}} about creating a new post after just ten years of discussion. They continue agreeing to pass no resolutions on other matters. They discuss Ox's request for a meeting.|$|E
5|$|Indium metal {{does not}} react with water, {{but it is}} {{oxidized}} by stronger oxidizing agents such as halogens to give indium(III) compounds. It does not form a boride, silicide, or carbide, and the hydride InH3 has at best a transitory existence in ethereal solutions at low temperatures, being unstable enough to spontaneously polymerize without coordination. Indium <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> basic in aqueous solution, showing only slight amphoteric characteristics, and unlike its lighter homologs aluminium and gallium, it is insoluble in aqueous alkaline solutions.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 15-17 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark purplish fuscous. The second discal stigma is obscurely {{darker and}} there are ochreous-white wedge-shaped strigulae on the costa at three-fourths and the dorsum before the tornus, connected by a faint sinuate whitish line. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark grey.|$|R
5|$|Like all actinides, {{einsteinium}} <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> reactive. Its trivalent {{oxidation state}} is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induced pale pink color. The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in solid phase; such +2 {{state is not}} observed in many other actinides, including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride. The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} spatial resolution (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Selenium occurs {{naturally}} {{in a number}} of inorganic forms, including selenide, selenate, and selenite, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral, and contains no selenite ion, but <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found as an impurity, replacing {{a small part of the}} sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 26 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> light rufous-brownish with the extreme costal edge yellow-whitish anteriorly, becoming dark fuscous posteriorly. The second discal stigma is minute and dark brown {{and there are}} blackish terminal dots becoming minute towards the tornus. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark grey.|$|R
