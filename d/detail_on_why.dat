Former World Bank Chief Economist William Easterly emphasizes why foreign aid tends to have no effect at best in bestsellers such as White Man’s Burden. Since the 2007-8 financial crisis there is a renewed interest in Hayek’s core explanation of boom-and-bust cycles, which serves as an alternative explanation to that of the savings glut as launched by Bernanke. Economists at the Bank of International Settlements, e.g. William White, emphasize the importance of Hayekian insights and the impact of monetary policies and credit growth as root causes of financial cycles. A. Hoffmann and G. Schnabl provide an international perspective and explain recurring financial cycles in the world economy as consequence of gradual interest rate cuts led by the central banks in the large advanced economies since the 1980s. N. Cachanosky outlines the impact of US monetary policy on the production structure in Latin America. In line with Hayek, an increasing number of contemporary researchers sees expansionary monetary policies and too low interest rates as mal-incentives and main drivers of financial crises in general, and the subprime market crisis in particular. To prevent problems caused by monetary policy, Hayekian/Austrian economists discuss alternatives to current policies and organizations. For instance, L. White favors free banking in the spirit of Hayek’s “Denationalization of Money”.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere {{is general}} {{agreement}} among public health practitioners, academics, and policymakers that people offered health screening tests {{should be able}} to make informed choices about whether to accept. Robust measures are necessary in order to gauge the extent to which informed choice is achieved in practice and whether efforts to improve it have succeeded. This review aims to add to the literature on how to improve methods of measuring informed choice. We discuss and critique commonly-used approaches and outline possible alternative methods that might address the issues identified. We explore the challenges of defining what information should be provided about screening and hence understood by service users, appraise the use of ‘thresholds’ to define e. g. positive attitudes towards screening, and describe problems inherent in conceptualising ‘informed choice’ as a single dichotomous outcome that either does or does not occur. Suggestions for future research include providing greater <b>detail</b> <b>on</b> <b>why</b> particular aspects of screening information were considered important, analysing knowledge and attitude measures at an ordinal or continuous level (avoiding problematic decisions about dichotomising data in order to set thresholds), and reconceptualising informed choice as a multifactorial set of outcomes, rather than a unitary one...|$|E

30|$|The section {{entitled}} Livelihoods forms less of {{a coherent}} whole than {{other parts of the}} book; the discussion of pastoral risk management in Mongolia in Chapters 20 and 21, written by a Mongolian herder, is interesting and also complements nicely some of the climate-related chapters which precede them. The other two papers relate more to government policy but do not really address the interaction between these policies and the steppe users themselves. Chapter 18, which pertains to be on steppe management in China, makes not even passing reference to the large body of literature on the impacts of privatisation and enclosure policies on the steppe environment in Inner Mongolia and other parts of China (for example, see Li et al. 2007; Yan et al. 2005).

40|$|National {{interest}} {{is an important}} concept {{in the field of}} International Relations (1 R) which scholars pinpoint to examine the action of states within the global system. Such examination, according to IR scholars, takes into cognizance some salient features of a particular state in defining the national interest. As would be expected, all independent states within the international system formulate foreign policies that take care of the domestic and external imperatives and most of the states’ action and behaviours within the international system have always been interpreted from the lens of national interest. As it is not practicable to subject all states and governments to empirical details in a study, this research employs the concept of national interest to discern Nigerian foreign policy direction under the most “despotic regime” in Nigeria history, General Sanni Abacha, between 1993 and 1998. This is expedient given the continuous criticism of the regime from both academic and policy quarters in Nigeria and abroad. The regime is recorded to have the worst record in human right abuse and as such put Nigeria under pariah status in the comity of nations. The research is conducted to unravel how Abacha defined and conceptualised Nigeria’s national interests and how policies were formulated and implemented to achieved such interests.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we address}} the {{problems}} related to the security hardening of open source software. Accordingly, we first propose an aspect-oriented and pattern-based approach for systematic security hardening. It {{is based on the}} full separation between the roles and duties of the security experts and the developers performing the hardening. Such proposition constitutes a bridge that allows the security experts to provide the best solutions to particular security problems with the <b>details</b> <b>on</b> <b>why,</b> how and where to apply them. Moreover, it allows the developers to use these solutions to harden open source software without the need to have high security expertise. We realize the proposed approach by elaborating a programming independent and aspect-oriented based language for security hardening called SHL, developing its corresponding parser, compiler and facilities and integrating all of them into a framework for software security hardening. We also illustrate the feasibility of the elaborated framework by developing several security hardening case studies that deal with known security requirements and vulnerabilities and applying them on large scale software. Second, we enrich SHL and the aspect-oriented languages with new pointcut and primitive constructs (GAFlow, GDFlow, ExportParameter and ImportParameter) that provide features missing in the current AOP proposals and needed for systematic security hardening concerns. We also explore the viability of the proposed pointcuts and primitives by elaborating and implementing their algorithms and presenting the result of explanatory case studies. Finally, we improve the proposed framework by proposing a new approach for applying security hardening on the Gimple representation of software and elaborating formal syntax for SHL and Gimple together with an operational semantics for SHL weaving based on Gimple. We realize our proposition by integrating into the GCC compiler few features described in the SHL weaving semantics and developing a demonstrative case stud...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} photospheric {{magnetic}} field of ~ 2000 active regions in solar cycle 23 {{to search for}} parameters indicative of energy build-up and subsequent release as a solar flare. We extract three sets of parameters: snapshots in space and time- total flux, magnetic gradients, and neutral lines; evolution in time- flux evolution; structures at multiple size scales- wavelet analysis. This combines pattern recognition and classification techniques via a relevance vector machine {{to determine whether a}} region will flare. We consider classification performance using all 38 extracted features and several feature subsets. Classification performance is quantified using both the true positive rate and the true negative rate. Additionally, we compute the true skill score which provides an equal weighting to true positive rate and true negative rate and the Heidke skill score to allow comparison to other flare forecasting work. We obtain a true skill score of ~ 0. 5 for any predictive time window in the range 2 - 24 hr, with a TPR of ~ 0. 8 and a TNR of ~ 0. 7. These values do not appear to depend on the time window, although the Heidke skill score (< 0. 5) does. Features relating to snapshots of the distribution of magnetic gradients show the best predictive ability over all predictive time windows. Other gradient-related features and the instantaneous power at various wavelet scales also feature in the top five ranked features in predictive power. While the photospheric magnetic field governs the coronal non-potentiality (and likelihood of flaring), photospheric magnetic field alone is not sufficient to determine this uniquely. Furthermore we are only measuring proxies of the magnetic energy build up. We still lack observational <b>details</b> <b>on</b> <b>why</b> energy is released at any particular point in time.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that various models can explain the {{emergence}} of complex networks, such as scale-free and small-world networks. This paper presents a different model to generate complex networks using a multi-agent approach. Each node is considered as an agent. Based on voting by all agents, edges are added repeatedly. We use four different kinds of centrality measures as a utility functions for agents. Depending on the centrality measure, the resultant networks differ considerably: typically closeness centrality generates a scale-free network, degree centrality produces a random graph, betweenness centrality favors a regular graph, and eigenvector centrality brings a complete subgraph. The im-portance of the network structure among agents is widely noted in the multi-agent research literature.

40|$|We examine {{defaulted}} {{bonds of}} predominantly US-based issuers {{who at the}} time of the initial default event had several publicly traded bonds outstanding. We find that in the vast majority of cases bonds of the same issuer and seniority are valued equally or within one dollar by the market, irrespective of their time to maturity. This strongly suggests that the amount recovered in default is best modelled as a fraction of face value at the time of default (RFV) as other assumptions, in general, cannot generate such a payoff pattern in bonds. We argue that this assumption is generated by the institutional framework which affects corporate bond pricing and thus is the only assumption with an underpinning theory. This may have important implications for empirical studies of credit risk which use models that do not incorporate RFV. While it has been remarked in the literature that RFV is often used in practice, up to now there has been little <b>detailed</b> discussion <b>on</b> <b>why</b> this should be the case nor any empirical support for such a hypothesis. In fact, some recent papers show support for alternative recovery assumptions. The results within strengthen the argument that the market may incorporate RFV when valuing corporate debt securities.

40|$|The foreign-language {{classroom}} {{has seen}} significant changes {{over the last}} two decades. Methodology of language acquisition changed (ACTFL 1986) and national standards for language teaching from Kindergarten to college were developed (ACTFL 1996).

Instructors no longer lecture in front of the class, but instead actively engage the student in the learning process.
