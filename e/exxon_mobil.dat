5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed themselves into trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the conglomerates to raise prices to high levels. In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) that serious efforts were made to break up or control the trusts. The dominant force in the oil industry was Standard Oil, controlled by John D. Rockefeller. Modern-day <b>Exxon,</b> <b>Mobil,</b> Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of Standard Oil.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of the Middle East in the international petroleum industry changedecisively in the fifteen years following the Second World War. Before 1939 its output was marginal compared to other world regions; twenty years later the Middle East was the largest source &crude oil outside the United States. Before 1939 a single company, British Petroleum (BP), dominated oil production in the region; after the war five American multinationals broke BP's hold. Bringing these two patterns together, {{we can say that}} the postwar growth of Middle Eastern output and its integration into the world oil trade was accomplished largely under American corporate leadership. A key episode in the rise of this American ascendancy was what the editors of Fortune called "The Great Oil Deals " of 1947. This dramatic label designated principally the entry of <b>Exxon</b> and <b>Mobil</b> into Arabian-American Oil Company (Aramco), which was Chevron and Texaco's joint venture in Saudi Arabia. <b>Exxon</b> and <b>Mobil's</b> purchase of 40 percent of Aramco provided the capital to develop Aramco's rich fields and construct a big pipeline to the Mediterranean. Output could readily be expanded because Aramco's crude would now be directed into the extensive marketing networks of the new partners.

5000|$|Like oil, {{natural gas}} is often found {{underwater}} in offshore gas fields such as the North Sea, Corrib Gas Field off Ireland, and the Sable Offshore Energy Project in the Scotian Shelf near Sable Island. The technology utilized to extract and transport offshore {{natural gas is}} different from land-based fields in that a few, very large rigs are usually used, due to the cost and logistical difficulties in working over water.Rising gas prices in the early 21st century encouraged drillers to revisit fields that previously were not considered economically viable.

On 10 March 1982, the U.S. prohibited imports of Libyan crude oil. <b>Exxon</b> and <b>Mobil</b> left their Libyan operations by January 1983.

5000|$|Paxton and {{the other}} state AGs filed an amicus curiae brief, contending that Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey used her office to [...] "tip the scales on a public policy debate, {{undermine}} the first Amendment and abuse the office's subpoena power." [...] Healey had launched a probe of ExxonMobil's historical marketing and sale of fossil fuel products, requiring the company to produce 40 years worth of documents regarding fossil fuel products and securities. Healey said the documents would prove that ExxonMobil [...] "knew {{about the risks of}} climate change decades ago and fraudulently concealed that knowledge from the public." [...] The amicus brief supported <b>Exxon</b> <b>Mobil's</b> motion for a preliminary injunction. Paxton questioned Healey’s use of law-enforcement authority regarding the global warming controversy, which he called an [...] "ongoing public policy debate of international importance." [...] Paxton described Healey's attempts to obtain historical company records for a public policy debate as a threat to freedom of speech, stating: [...] "The Constitution was written to protect citizens from government witch-hunts that are nothing more than an attempt to suppress speech on an issue of public importance, just because a government official happens to disagree with that particular viewpoint." [...] The brief portrayed climate change as an issue that was still a matter of scientific debate, although in fact the scientific consensus is that the earth is warming and human activity is primarily responsible.|$|R
