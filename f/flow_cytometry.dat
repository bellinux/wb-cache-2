5|$|The {{diagnosis}} and classification of AML can be challenging, {{and should be}} performed by a qualified hematopathologist or hematologist. In straightforward cases, the presence of certain morphologic features (such as Auer rods) or specific <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> results can distinguish AML from other leukemias; however, {{in the absence of}} such features, diagnosis may be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Marrow {{or blood}} is {{examined}} under light microscopy, {{as well as}} <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry,</b> to diagnose the presence of leukemia, to differentiate AML from other types of leukemia (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia - ALL), and to classify the subtype of disease. A sample of marrow or blood is typically also tested for chromosomal abnormalities by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as FLT3, nucleophosmin, and KIT, which may influence {{the outcome of the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|In research, {{purified}} antibodies {{are used}} in many applications. Antibodies for research applications can be found directly from antibody suppliers, or through use of a specialist search engine. Research antibodies are most commonly used to identify and locate intracellular and extracellular proteins. Antibodies {{are used in}} <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> to differentiate cell types by the proteins they express; different types of cell express different combinations of cluster of differentiation molecules on their surface, and produce different intracellular and secretable proteins. They are also used in immunoprecipitation to separate proteins and anything bound to them (co-immunoprecipitation) from other molecules in a cell lysate, in Western blot analyses to identify proteins separated by electrophoresis, and in immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence to examine protein expression in tissue sections or to locate proteins within cells {{with the assistance of}} a microscope. Proteins can also be detected and quantified with antibodies, using ELISA and ELISPOT techniques.|$|E
25|$|Saving of {{the steps}} taken in a {{particular}} <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> workflow is supported by some <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> software, and {{is important for the}} reproducibility of <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> experiments.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> {{bioinformatics}} is {{the application}} of bioinformatics to <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data, which involves storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data using extensive computational resources and tools.|$|E
25|$|The {{processes}} of computing the spillover matrix, or applying a precomputed spillover matrix to compensate <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data, are standard features of <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> software.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flow</b> <b>Cytometry</b> Standard (FCS) was {{developed}} in 1984 to allow recording and sharing of <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data. Since then, FCS became the standard file format supported by all <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> software and hardware vendors. The FCS specification has traditionally been developed and maintained by the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC). Over the years, updates were incorporated to adapt to {{technological advancements in both}} <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> and computing technologies with FCS 2.0 introduced in 1990, FCS 3.0 in 1997, and the most current specification FCS 3.1 in 2010. FCS used to be the only widely adopted file format in <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry.</b> Recently, additional standard file formats have been developed by ISAC.|$|E
25|$|The Minimum Information about a <b>Flow</b> <b>Cytometry</b> Experiment (MIFlowCyt), {{requires}} that any <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data {{used in a}} publication be available, although {{this does not include}} a requirement that it be deposited in a public database.|$|E
25|$|GenePattern is a {{predominantly}} genomic analysis platform with over 200 tools {{for analysis of}} gene expression, proteomics, and other data. A web-based interface provides easy access to these tools and allows the creation of automated analysis pipelines enabling reproducible research. Recently, a GenePattern <b>Flow</b> <b>Cytometry</b> Suite has been developed {{in order to bring}} advanced <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data analysis tools to experimentalists without programmatic skills. It contains close to 40 open source GenePattern <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> modules covering methods from basic processing of <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> standard (i.e., FCS) files to advanced algorithms for automated identification of cell populations, normalization and quality assessment. Internally, most of these modules leverage functionality developed in BioConductor.|$|E
25|$|Prior to analysis, <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data must {{typically}} undergo pre-processing {{to remove}} artifacts and poor quality data, {{and to be}} transformed onto an optimal scale for identifying cell populations of interest. Below are various steps in a typical <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> preprocessing pipeline.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> {{has several}} {{advantages}} over IHC including: {{the ability to}} define distinct cell populations by their size and granularity; the capacity to gate out dead cells; improved sensitivity; and multi-colour analysis to measure several antigens simultaneously. However, <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> can be less effective at detecting extremely rare cell populations, {{and there is a}} loss of architectural relationships {{in the absence of a}} tissue section. <b>Flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> also has a high capital cost associated with the purchase of a flow cytometer.|$|E
25|$|Subclinical PNH. PNH {{abnormalities}} on <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> without {{signs of}} hemolysis.|$|E
25|$|CD {{molecules}} are {{utilized in}} cell sorting using various methods including <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|Open standards, {{data and}} {{software}} are also key parts of <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> bioinformatics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> {{and related}} methods allow the {{quantification}} of multiple independent biomarkers on {{large numbers of}} single cells. The rapid growth in the multidimensionality and throughput of <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data, particularly in the 2000s, {{has led to the}} creation of a variety of computational analysis methods, data standards, and public databases for the sharing of results.|$|E
25|$|Cell populations {{detected}} by <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> are {{often described as}} having approximately log-normal expression.|$|E
25|$|As of July 2013, Bioconductor {{contained}} 21 {{software packages}} for processing <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the early}} 2000s, <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> could only measure a few {{fluorescent}} markers at a time.|$|E
25|$|Despite rapid {{development}} {{in the field of}} <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> bioinformatics, several problems remain to be addressed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> {{is helpful}} to {{establish}} the presence of any lymphoproliferative disorder in the marrow.|$|E
25|$|This overlap is termed spillover, and {{the process}} of {{removing}} spillover from <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data is called compensation.|$|E
25|$|ISAC is {{considering}} replacing FCS with a <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> specific {{version of the}} Network Common Data Form (netCDF) file format.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> {{bioinformatics}} requires {{extensive use}} of and contributes {{to the development of}} techniques from computational statistics and machine learning.|$|E
25|$|Variability across <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> {{experiments}} {{arises from}} biological variation among samples, technical variations across instruments used, {{as well as}} methods of analysis.|$|E
25|$|Normalization {{methods to}} remove {{technical}} variance, frequently derived from image registration techniques, are thus a critical step in many <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> analyses.|$|E
25|$|Using the CytoBank code base, FlowRepository was {{developed}} in 2012 {{with the support of}} ISAC to be a public repository of <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data.|$|E
25|$|However, {{compensated}} <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data frequently contains {{negative values}} due to compensation, and cell populations do occur which have low means and normal distributions.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, CytoBank, {{which is}} a {{complete}} web-based <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data storage and analysis platform, has been {{made available to the}} public in a limited form.|$|E
25|$|Flow {{immunophenotyping}} - {{the determination}} of the immunophenotype of cells using <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> techniques. It is very useful to diagnose the different types of leukemia and lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|This {{was echoed}} by {{another group of}} Pacific Biosciences and Stanford University researchers, who {{suggested}} that cloud computing could enable centralized, standardized, high-throughput analysis of <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> experiments.|$|E
25|$|BiFC {{has been}} coupled with <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> (BiFC-FC). This allows proteinâ€“protein {{interaction}} surfaces to be mapped through {{the introduction of}} site-directed or random mutations that affect complex formation.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{although}} the journals Cytometry Part A and B, {{as well as}} all journals from the Nature Publishing Group require MIFlowCyt compliance, there is still relatively little publicly available <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data.|$|E
25|$|A {{flow cytometer}} {{can be used}} for the direct {{analysis}} of cells expressing one or more specific proteins. Cells are immunostained in solution using methods similar to those used for immunofluorescence, and then analysed by <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|The rapid {{increase}} in the dimensionality of <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> data, coupled {{with the development of}} high-throughput robotic platforms capable of assaying hundreds to thousands of samples automatically have created a need for improved computational analysis methods.|$|E
25|$|An {{attempt to}} solve this problem is the {{development}} of the Gating-ML XML-based data standard (discussed in more detail under the standards section), which is slowly being adopted in both commercial and open source <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> software.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{diagnosis}} using <b>flow</b> <b>cytometry</b> {{data can}} be aided by supervised learning techniques, and discovery of new cell types of biological importance by high-throughput statistical methods, as part of pipelines incorporating all of the aforementioned methods.|$|E
