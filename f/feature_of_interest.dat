25|$|One <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{near the}} {{beginning}} of section two is Horseshoe Bend, located after the third timber bridge from Redlynch. In December 1888 the embankment at the bend was described as 51 feet (15.5m) high, 15 feet (4.6m) wide at the top, and 170 feet (51.8m) wide at the base, and was sown with Couch grass (Cynodon dactylon) on the sides. The embankment has since been widened using landslide material. Section two used Horseshoe Bend to gain height, followed by the line ascending to the top of Barron Falls. The section then followed the Barron River to Kuranda, terminating at Myola, almost 3km past Kuranda. Nineteen tunnels had been originally planned between Horseshoe Bend and Barron Falls Station, but four (two between Stoney Creek and Tunnel 14 and two at Red Bluff) were subsequently replaced by cuttings. Sand from the bed of the Barron River was used as the base material for concrete work on the second section; all the tunnels were concrete lined, and culverts and drains were also built in concrete.|$|E
2500|$|The church {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book was replaced in the mid-13th century by the present structure, which is the third church on the site (a grassed area within the grounds of Preston Manor). [...] It consisted of a chancel, nave with no aisles and a tower at the west end with a shallow pyramidal cap (of the type known as a Sussex Cap), corbel table and narrow lancet windows. [...] Its main <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{was a series of}} 13th- and 14th-century wall paintings around the chancel arch and the nave, which depicted the Nativity of Jesus, Saint Michael weighing the souls of the dead at the Last Judgment, the murder and martyrdom of Thomas Becket, Doubting Thomas, other saints, and the [...] "Noli me tangere" [...] scene at Jesus's Resurrection. [...] They were covered with plaster {{at the time of the}} Reformation and were rediscovered in 1830 by the vicar, Reverend Charles Townsend.|$|E
2500|$|More {{land was}} {{required}} for development, and a long-established but dilapidated farm near the station, Southlands Farm, was bought and demolished in 1888 {{to make way for}} new roads and houses linking the commercial area around the station with the road to Lindfield, a neighbouring village. [...] The vicar of St Wilfrid's Church, Reverend Thomas Wyatt, supported the construction of daughter churches, administered from St Wilfrid's, to serve distant parts of the town. [...] One such church, the Chapel of the Holy Spirit, was built in this new residential area in 1897, and became the chapel of ease for the northern side of the parish. [...] Its shape and building material led to it being nicknamed [...] "the tin tabernacle". [...] Its main <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> was a pipe organ taken from Lancing College. [...] The small building cost £900 (£ in [...] ), of which nearly half was raised through public donations.|$|E

The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest.

60|$|Those are the facts. She {{was not at}} the {{reception}} at all, or anywhere near it; but I saw her there nevertheless, and most clearly and unmistakably. To that I could make oath. How is one to explain this? I was not thinking of her at the time; had not thought of her for years. But she had been thinking of me, no doubt; did her thoughts flit through leagues of air to me, and bring with it that clear and pleasant vision of herself? I think so. That was and remains my sole experience in the matter of apparitions--I mean apparitions that come when one is (ostensibly) awake. I could have been asleep for a moment; the apparition could have been the creature of a dream. Still, that is nothing to the point; the <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is the happening of the thing just at that time, instead of at an earlier or later time, which is argument that its origin lay in thought-transference.|$|E
6000|$|... § XIII. Of {{the body}} of the church, unhappily, they are few and obscure; but the general form and extent of the building, as shown in the plan, Plate I. fig. 2, are determined, first, by the breadth of the uninjured east end D E; secondly, by some remains of the {{original}} brickwork of the clerestory, and in all probability of the side walls also, though these have been refaced; and finally by the series of nave shafts, which are still perfect. The doors A and B {{may or may not be}} in their original positions; there must of course have been always, as now, a principal entrance at the west end. The ground plan is composed, like that of Torcello, of nave and aisles only, but the clerestory has transepts extending as far as the outer wall of the aisles. The semicircular apse, thrown out in the centre of the east end, is now the chief <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in the church, though the nave shafts and the eastern extremities of the aisles, outside, are also portions of the original building; the latter having been modernized in the interior, it cannot now be ascertained whether, as is probable, the aisles had once round ends as well as the choir. The spaces F G form small chapels, of which G has a straight terminal wall behind its altar, and F a curved one, marked by the dotted line; the partitions which divide these chapels from the presbytery are also indicated by dotted lines, being modern work.|$|E

40|$|Interactive data {{visualization}} is inherently an iterative trial-and-error process {{searching for an}} ideal set of parameters for classifying and rendering <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in the data. This paper presents 3 -d region growing based techniques that can assist the users to locate and define <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in volume data more quickly and more accurately. One technique employs partial region growing to generate a 2 -d transfer function that effectively reveals the full <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The other technique uses the result of full region growing to systematically construct a boundary surface for the extracted features. The resulting polygonal representation of the boundary surface can facilitate comparison, measurement, and simulation. A visual assessment method is suggested by using the extracted volume and surface information. These techniques either shorten or completely eliminate the typical trial-and-error {{step in the process}} of interactive data exploration. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Image preview is a {{convenient}} way to browse large or multiple images on small displays. However, current signal-level image resampling algorithms may remove many <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in the preview image. In this paper, we propose perceptual image preview which retains more perceptual features such that users can inspect <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> by viewing the preview image only and without zooming in. This technology has two components, structure enhancement and perceptual feature visualization. Structure enhancement enhances the image structure while suppressing subtle details using a gradient modulation method, thus making the succedent perceptual features more apparent. For perceptual <b>feature</b> visualization, <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{detected in the}} picture is visualized on the structure enhanced preview image. We demonstrate with two examples of most commonly used image quality features, image blur and noise. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by experimental results...|$|R
