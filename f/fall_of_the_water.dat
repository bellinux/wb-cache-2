There was only a slight ripple and <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> and, after a second glance, it was evident that the point of land was not an island, but a portion of the mainland which divided the stream.

It were too much to pretend that Betty Higden made out such thoughts; no; but she heard the tender river whispering to many like herself, 'Come to me, come to me! When the cruel shame and terror you have so long fled from, most beset you, come to me! I am the Relieving Officer appointed by eternal ordinance to do my work; I am not held in estimation according as I shirk it. My breast is softer than the pauper-nurse's; death in my arms is peacefuller than among the pauper-wards. Come to me!' ...|$|E

Yet, before the war, he had more experience of the business and detail of death than any of the people who contemned him. His face also, as he stands his bedside-watches--that countenance with which he shall justify himself to his Maker--none have ever looked upon. Even the ditcher is a priest of mysteries at the high moment when he lays out in his mind his levels and the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> that he alone can draw off clearly.

60|$|The pioneers had now at last {{reached the}} {{entrance}} of {{what appeared to be}} a lake, which was in the neighbourhood of the Polar Sea, if not that sea itself; but the variety of channels, the strength of currents, the shallowness of the water and quantity of ice with which it was beset, with the ignorance of their guide, rendered it impossible to make any further advance that season. The object of the expedition, however, had been accomplished. The largest northern river of America, estimated at 2000 miles in length, had been traced from its source to its outlet in the Polar Sea; the nature of the country and its inhabitants had been ascertained; coal and copper ore had been discovered; the region had been wrenched from the realms of terra incognita, and the energetic pioneer fixed the position of his most northerly discoveries in 69 degrees 7 minutes north latitude. Another fact which proved that they were within the influence of the sea was the rise and <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> which could be nothing else than the tide.|$|E

60|$|When we {{had passed}} through this second valley, I {{perceived}} {{we came to a}} narrower passage, and something like the first; the entrance into it indeed was smooth, and above {{a quarter of a mile}} broad, and it went winding away to the north, and then again turned round to the north-east, afterwards almost due-east, and then to the south-east, and so to south-south-east; and this frightful narrow strait, with the hanging rocks almost closing together on the top, whose height we could neither see nor guess at, continued about three days' journey more, most of the way ascending gently before us. As to the river, it was by this time quite lost; but we might see, that on any occasion of rain, or of the melting of the snow on the mountains, there was a hollow in the middle of the valley through which the water made its way, and on either hand, the sides of the hills were full of the like gulleys, made by the violence of the rain, where, not the earth only, but the rocks themselves, even the very stone, seemed to be worn and penetrated by the continual <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{questionnaire}} {{asked whether}} dogs or other animals behaved strangely {{prior to the}} earthquake, {{whether there was a}} noticeable difference in the rise or <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level in wells, and how many buildings had been destroyed and what kind of destruction had occurred. The answers have allowed modern Portuguese scientists to reconstruct the event with precision.|$|E
5000|$|The reserve {{lies in a}} {{transition}} zone between the Chiquitano Tropical Dry Forest and the Amazon Rainforest, with elements of both ecoregions, and it is of great conservational importance owing to its rich biodiversity. The San Pablo and Blanco Rivers are rich in nutrients and cause seasonal flooding in the areas closest to the plains, forming the so-called [...] "Várzea forest", which regulate the rise and <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> levels.|$|E
50|$|The Municipality lies on {{the plain}} and {{slightly}} slopy area hence erosion is less. But due to its location along <b>the</b> lake, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> areas are affected by <b>the</b> rise and <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake <b>water</b> level.|$|R
5|$|The {{species is}} almost totally {{restricted}} to the swales and lower slopes of dunes.

The latter hypothesis is supported by <b>the</b> recent expansion <b>of</b> B.prionotes along road verges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brand Highway, where fires are relatively rare. Despite B.prionotes occurrence in lower parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landscape, it does not occur in areas prone to flooding, because of its intolerance of heavy soils, and because extended periods of flooding kill seedlings. However, recent <b>falls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table on <b>the</b> Swan Coastal Plain have seen B.prionotes replace the more water-loving Banksia littoralis in some areas that were previously flood-prone.|$|R
5000|$|Buckland, too, {{gradually}} modified {{his views}} on the Deluge. In 1832 a student noted Buckland's view on cause of diluvial gravel, [...] "whether is Mosaic inundation or not, will not say". In a footnote to his Bridgewater Treatise of 1836, Buckland backed down from his former claim that the [...] "violent inundation" [...] identified in his Reliquiae Diluvianae was the Genesis flood: [...] it seems more probable, that the event in question, was <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many geological revolutions that have been produced by violent irruptions <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> rather than <b>the</b> comparatively tranquil inundation described in the Inspired Narrative. It has been justly argued, against the attempt to identity these two great historical and natural phenomena, that, as <b>the</b> rise and <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mosaic deluge are described to have been gradual and of short duration, they would have produced comparatively little change on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country they overflowed.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "rip tide" [...] or [...] "riptide" [...] {{is often}} {{incorrectly}} applied to rip currents, {{which are not}} tidal flows. A rip current is a strong, narrow jet of water that {{moves away from the}} beach and into the ocean.  They can flow quickly and are not predictable and are a result of the shape of the coastline.  A rip tide is caused by the moon's gravitational pull and is a predictable rise and <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level.|$|E
50|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the {{lungfish}} burrowing patterns correlate well with the rise and <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table. The height of the water table would have increased during the rainy season, but then decreased rapidly as the winds shifted and diverted moisture away from the location, thus initiating the dry season. Additional evidence of seasonality {{can be observed in}} the fossilized carcasses of other vertebrate organisms. These show signs of substantial drying (which would have occurred during the winter) before being buried and preserved by mudflow (resulting from a persistent rainy period).|$|E
50|$|On {{its main}} forks, the Coquille {{is also an}} {{alluvial}} river valley, meaning it was once a drowned river valley—a lake, or perhaps a much wider river, with a sandy bottom. The soil in the valley is very fertile. However, the rise and <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level, and flooding in winter, prevent ordinary types of farming. A lush grass grows in the valley lowlands which can survive either drought or inundation. Tide-gates along the river can bring in water when needed. On this sweeping stand of grass, in summer many cattle find pasture.|$|E

50|$|Drosera kenneallyi {{is found}} in sandy loam soils on <b>the</b> margins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Airfield Swamp. The type {{material}} was collected under a Eucalyptus latifolia near the Airfield Swamp. During January and February, this species is frequently flooded with high-temperature water.

5000|$|The Salt Creek Falls drops about 286 ft, which varies {{little in}} height {{because of the}} even level of the giant {{boulders}} at its crest.

Since the flow is a direct function of the Salt Creek water volume, it typically peaks when the mountain snow melts in the late spring or early summer. No water diversion facility exists within the falls or anywhere along Salt Creek.|$|E
50|$|Melingriffith Works was {{situated}} {{at the foot of}} the Taff Valley, on the banks of the Taff River and the Glamorganshire Canal. The works covered an area of 4 acre. They were connected with the Glamorganshire Canal and also with the Taff Vale Railway by a siding nearly 2 mi long, at a point just below Taff's Well station. The eleven rolling mills were situated at a lower level than the other parts of the works in order to take advantage of the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> The Radyr Weir, situated on the river about 1 mi above the works, was renewed and strengthened in 1774 to provide a more regular supply of water.

50|$|Plant number two, {{which was}} one 100 ft. by 176 ft. in dimensions, {{generated}} an average of 34,000 continuous horsepower. The entire <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> in the canal from the forebay to the tailrace is 210 ft. The power canal, which taps the river at a point above Port Day, and runs throughout the city to a point below the Steel Arch Bridge, furnished {{a steady supply of}} water year round. Just below Port Day {{is the beginning of the}} rapids, with a fall of more than 50 ft. in three quarters of a mile. By cutting across a bend in the river the canal comes out at the cliff below the bridge the entire distance being about 4,400 ft. Built before the era of industrial production of alternating current, the electrical plant generated direct-current electricity, and only provided it within a range of two miles from the plant.|$|E
40|$|OWC {{wave energy}} {{converters}} work on <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> wave induced air pressurization. They usually {{consist of a}} tube {{or some sort of}} closed containment placed above <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface and <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> waves changes <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level within <b>the</b> housing. If the housing is completely sealed, <b>the</b> rising and <b>falling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level will increase and decrease the air pressure respectively within the housing or containment. We can place a turbine on <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> housing through which air may pass in and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> housing. Air will flow into the housing during a wave trough and out of it during a wave crest. Due to this bidirectional flow <b>of</b> air, <b>the</b> turbine must be designed {{in such a way that}} it will rotate in only one direction no matter what <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> air flow. <b>The</b> wells turbine is designed for this purpose and it is commonly used in OWC devices.

500|$|Along with Banksia attenuata, Banksia menziesii is a facultative phreatophyte. The {{two species}} are less {{strictly}} tied to <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table and hence {{able to grow}} in {{a wider variety of}} places within banksia woodland habitat around Perth than the co-occurring Banksia ilicifolia and Banksia littoralis. Recent <b>falls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table on <b>the</b> Swan Coastal Plain from use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gnangara Mound aquifer for Perth's water supply as well as years of below average rainfall have caused a drop in the population and vigour of Banksia menziesii since the mid-1960s. A 2009 Spanish study showed Banksia menziesii seedlings to be moderately sensitive to salinity. It is also sensitive to sulfur dioxide. A 1994 study by Byron Lamont and colleagues from Curtin University found that Banksia menziesii plants within [...] of road verges had crowns {{two and a half times}} bigger, and set three times as many seeds as plants further away from the road, and that this was likely due to increased availability of nutrients and water from runoff.|$|R

50|$|The {{decline of}} the Atitlán grebe began in 1958 and again in 1960 after smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were {{introduced}} into Lake Atitlán. These invasive species reduced the crabs and fish which the grebes depended on for food and the fish even killed the grebe chicks. The population of the Atitlán grebe declined from 200 individuals in 1960 to 80 in 1965. Thanks to the conservation efforts of Anne LaBastille, in 1966 a refuge was established where this species was able to rebound. The population recovered to 210 in 1973. Unfortunately after the 1976 Guatemala earthquake, the lake bed fractured. An underwater drain led to a <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level and to a further severe decrease {{of the number of}} grebes. In 1983 only 32 individuals were left, of which the largest part were hybrids with the pied-billed grebe. The last two birds were seen in 1989, and after they disappeared the Atitlán grebe was declared officially extinct.|$|E
