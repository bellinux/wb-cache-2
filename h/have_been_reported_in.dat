5|$|Of 19 {{species of}} native nestmaking {{bumblebees}} and six species of cuckoo bumblebees formerly widespread in Britain, three have been extirpated, eight are in serious decline, and only six remain widespread. Similar declines <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> Ireland, with four species designated endangered, and another two considered vulnerable to extinction. A decline in bumblebee numbers could cause large-scale {{changes to the}} countryside, resulting from inadequate pollination of certain plants.|$|E
5|$|Only a few {{compounds}} with metals <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported,</b> <b>in</b> {{the form}} of astatides of sodium, palladium, silver, thallium, and lead.

5|$|Bupropion is {{considered}} moderately dangerous in overdose. For significant overdoses, seizures <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> {{about a third}} of all cases; other serious effects include hallucinations, loss of consciousness, and abnormal heart rhythms. When bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose, fever, muscle rigidity, muscle damage, hypertension or hypotension, stupor, coma, and respiratory failure have been reported. While most people recover, some people have died, and before they died suffered multiple uncontrolled seizures and heart attacks.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{mutations}} in the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit (Cav1.1) {{have been described}} in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> the genes coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E

5|$|In Europe and the Americas, a {{relatively}} small number of DPB cases <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.|$|E
5|$|It is a big, strong cat, {{similar to}} the Maine Coon breed, with long legs, a bushy tail and a sturdy body. The breed {{is very good at}} climbing, since they have strong claws. The {{lifespan}} is usually 14 to 16 years, though kidney and heart diseases <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> the breed. Specifically in this breed, complex rearrangements of glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause a perinatal hypoglycaemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV.|$|E
5|$|More than 50specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex {{have been}} identified, {{some of which}} are nearly {{complete}} skeletons. Soft tissue and proteins <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> {{at least one of these}} specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into many aspects of its biology, including its life history and biomechanics. The feeding habits, physiology and potential speed of Tyrannosaurus rex are a few subjects of debate. Its taxonomy is also controversial, as some scientists consider Tarbosaurus bataar from Asia to be a second Tyrannosaurus species while others maintain Tarbosaurus is a separate genus. Several other genera of North American tyrannosaurids have also been synonymized with Tyrannosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Panic {{reactions}} {{can occur}} after consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, {{especially if the}} ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected. Reactions characterized by violent behavior, suicidal thoughts, schizophrenia-like psychosis, and convulsions <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> the literature. A 2005 survey conducted in the United Kingdom found that {{almost a quarter of}} those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the past year had experienced a panic attack. Other adverse effects less frequently reported include paranoia, confusion, prolonged derealization (disconnection from reality), and mania. Psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder. Usage by those with schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization.|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} in the hartebeest is 40. Hybrids are usually reported from areas where ranges of two subspecies overlap. Hybrids between the Lelwel and Tora hartebeest <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> eastern Sudan and western Ethiopia, in a stretch southward from the Blue Nile to about 9° N latitude. A study proved a male hybrid {{of the red}} hartebeest and the blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus) to be sterile. Sterility of the hybrid was attributed to difficulties in segregation during meiosis, indicated by azoospermia and a low number of germ cells in its seminiferous tubules.|$|E

The review by The Morning Telegraph states that has both the blind girl and mother wander onto the hospital grounds.

5|$|Treatment {{is focused}} on {{reducing}} stroke episodes and damage from a distending artery. Four treatment modalities <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> the treatment of vertebral artery dissection. The two main treatments involve medication: anticoagulation (using heparin and warfarin) and antiplatelet drugs (usually aspirin). More rarely, thrombolysis (medication that dissolves blood clots) may be administered, and occasionally obstruction may be treated with angioplasty and stenting. No randomized controlled trials have been performed to compare the different treatment modalities. Surgery is only used in exceptional cases.|$|E
