This {{study was}} done to test the {{hypothesis}} that medical practitioners lacked the confidence to get involved in <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> management because of lack of previous training in the discipline. Questionnaires were administered to a group of medical practitioners to assess their attitude to their role in the management of <b>child</b> <b>abuse,</b> their perception of their knowledge of the physical findings in <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> and their ability to manage the problem. It was found that although practitioners recognized the importance of their role in <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> management they lacked confidence in their knowledge of the physical findings of <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> and their ability to manage the problem.

40|$|Background: Suspected <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> {{reports to}} <b>Child</b> Protective Services (CPS) made by pre-school {{teachers}} {{has been on}} the rise. Consequently, that raises the question about whether the teachers' knowledge or awareness of <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> or the actual number of children who have been abused has increased. Pre-school teachers, as many other professionals who work with children on a daily basis, face many challenges in their work place. Purpose: The purpose of the study is to describe the pre-school teachers' experiences with <b>child</b> <b>abuse,</b> including how they identify children who have been abused and how they determine whether they need to make a suspected <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> report to <b>Children</b> Protective Services. Method: A qualitative design with phenomenology-hermeneutics approach was used in this study. Individual interviews were conducted with pre-school teachers from both public and private preschools. Findings: The study demonstrated that the experiences of pre-school teachers related to identifying and reporting <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> can be categorized in six sections: 1) Maltreatment (or <b>child</b> <b>abuse)</b> - a broad definition, 2) "Hidden" maltreatment (or <b>child</b> <b>abuse),</b> 3) Seriousness of the abuse, 4) A process from identification of <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> to making a suspected <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> report, 5) Loyalty to the work place, and 6) Making an acquaintance with parents. 5 Conclusion: Pre- school teachers view the concept of the maltreatment (<b>child</b> <b>abuse)</b> of <b>children</b> as broad, and that the <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> could be " hidden. " (hard to be identified). It has been reported that it is easier to identify children who have been sexually abused or victims of violence then children who have been physically or mentally abused. The decision about whether to file a suspected <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> report with the Children Protective Services has been based on the seriousness of the maltreatment.

40|$|ABSTRACT 	 The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} that one way New Zealand's high prevalence of <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> can be reduced is by the government increasing the legislative and policy responses within an ecological framework, to <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> prevention. This is because such responses would ensure a 'best practice' approach to <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> prevention. This 'best-practice' approach is one where <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> prevention measures are community-driven, child-centred, multi-disciplinary and inter-sectoral. Section 1 of this thesis will provide a background on the different types of <b>child</b> <b>abuse,</b> why <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> occurs and what the consequences of <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> are. This section will also cover some current statistics on the incidences of <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> in New Zealand. Additionally, there is a discussion on how <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> is increasingly being minimised within a family violence paradigm - even though family violence is only one form of <b>child</b> <b>abuse.</b> New Zealand does not have a good track record when it comes to its rates of <b>child</b> <b>abuse.</b> Section 1 is intended to give the reader a very clear picture of how children in New Zealand are not currently being protected adequately enough from <b>child</b> <b>abuse.</b> This protection should be coming from the adults in their lives, in their community and in their nation. Section 2 of this thesis outlines an ecological framework for <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> prevention. More specifically the way in which such an ecological model is operating presently in New Zealand, at particularly an exosystem (community) and macrosystem (national) level. The second part of this section discusses factors which will ensure the 'success' of an ecological framework for <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> prevention. By 'success' the author is referring to a framework in which the primary outcome is the prevalence of <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> in New Zealand is reducing. Section 3 of this thesis will contain the substantive arguments of this paper. New Zealand does currently have in place legislative and policy responses to <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> prevention. However, the author maintains these responses to date have not been sufficient because New Zealand's rates of <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> continue to escalate. This section consists of 19 recommendations of legislative and policy responses that could be implemented at a macrosystem/national level. At the conclusion of the recommendations contained in this thesis, it becomes clear that the government does need to respond urgently to New Zealand's growing <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> rates. New Zealand can no longer afford to have a reactive, ad-hoc approach to <b>child</b> <b>abuse.</b> Nor can the response at a macro level continue to be one of rhetoric where there is more talk on <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> prevention than there is on activating, monitoring and funding practical solutions. It is the author's contention that if the government considered the interests and welfare of children as paramount in legislative and policy decisions that relate to children, then this will send a strong and clear signal to the adults in childrens' lives that children are not to be <b>abused.</b> Instead, <b>children</b> are to be nurtured, respected and cherished in every way...|$|R
40|$|<b>Child</b> <b>abuse</b> {{is defined}} as those acts or {{omissions}} of care that deprive a child from the opportunity to fully develop his or her unique potentials as a person either physically, socially or emotionally. The overall incidence of <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> is not really clear. Statistical data do not show the actual rate because of the unreported cases. Dentists are in a strategic position to recognize and report the <b>children</b> being <b>abused</b> because they often see the child and parents interacting during multiple visits and {{over a long period}} of time. The orofacial region is commonly traumatized during episodes of <b>child</b> <b>abuse.</b> The characteristics and diagnostic finding of <b>child</b> <b>abuse,</b> and the protocol of reporting such cases, should be familiar to the dentist so that appropriate notification, treatment and prevention of further injury can be instituted. Dentists with experience or expertise in <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> and neglect will strengthen their ability to prevent and detect <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> and neglect and enhance the ability to care for and protect children.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{identify}} facilitators of, {{and barriers}} to, screening for <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> in emergency departments (ED) through interviews with ED staff, {{members of the}} hospital Board, and related experts. Methods This qualitative study is based on semi-structured interviews with 27 professionals from seven Dutch hospitals (i. e. seven pediatricians, two surgeons, six ED nurses, six ED managers and six hospital Board members). The resulting list of facilitators/barriers was subsequently discussed with five experts in <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> and one implementation expert. The results are ordered using the <b>Child</b> <b>Abuse</b> Framework of the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate that legally requires screening for <b>child</b> <b>abuse.</b> Results Lack of knowledge of <b>child</b> <b>abuse,</b> communication with parents {{in the case of}} suspected abuse, and lack of time for development of policy and cases are barriers for ED staff to screen for <b>child</b> <b>abuse.</b> For Board members, lack of means and time, and a high turnover of ED staff are impediments to improving their <b>child</b> <b>abuse</b> policy. Screening can be promoted by training ED staff to better recognize <b>child</b> <b>abuse,</b> improving communication skills, appointing an attendant specifically for <b>child</b> <b>abuse,</b> explicit support of the screening policy by management, and by national implementation of an approved protocol and validated screening instrument. Conclusions ED staff are motivated to work according to the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate requirements but experiences many barriers, particularly communication with parents of children suspected of being abused.
