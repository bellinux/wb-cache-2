GOD grant that on that Christmas Eve when he laid his head back on his pillow and threw up his arms as he had been wont to do when very weary, some consciousness of duty done and Christian hope throughout life humbly cherished, may have caused his own heart so to throb, when he passed away to his Redeemer's rest! ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Interlineation</b> is a {{legal term}} that signifies writing has been {{inserted}} between earlier language. [...] It is commonly used to indicate the insertion of new language between previous sentences in a contract, though {{it may also be}} used in other contexts. For example, interlineations can help to clarify specific points of a legal contract, and are useful if some of the terms of a contract become unclear later. They are typically initialed and dated, so as to make a record of changes and agreements to a particular contract.|$|E

50|$|His first cartoon for a fanzine {{appeared}} in Cry of the Nameless, edited by F.M. Busby and Elinor Busby. A fanzine <b>interlineation</b> he coined ("Death is nature's {{way of telling}} you when to stop") became a national catchphrase after it was reprinted in Pageant in 1962. His work (art and text) has since {{appeared in}} leading fanzines (Xero, Void, Mimosa, Trap Door) {{as well as the}} more obscure (Vojo de Vivo). He publishes his own fanzine, SAM.

5000|$|Codding v. Placer Co. Clerk: During {{the period}} of time in California after the ban on {{same-sex}} marriage was found unconstitutional, and before the passage of Proposition 8, the State of California changed the marriage form from Bride and Groom to Party A and Party B. A man and woman applied for a wedding license and, with the approval of the clerk manning the window, wrote back in the words Bride and Groom. [...] After the couple was married, the officiating minister signed and mailed in the marriage certificate. [...] It was rejected by the County Clerk because of the <b>interlineation.</b> [...] A suit was filed in state court which resulted in significant publicity because of its timing before the general election in which Prop. 8 appeared on the ballot. [...] The case was settled with the State of California when officials agreed to change the form to put back in the words Bride and Groom.|$|E
5000|$|DRR may {{be applied}} to restore a gift erroneously struck from a will if {{the intent of the}} {{testator}} was to enlarge that gift, but will not apply to restore such a gift if the intent of the testator was to revoke the gift in favor of another person. For example, suppose Tom has a will that bequeaths $5,000 to his secretary, Alice Johnson. If Tom crosses out that clause and writes [...] "$7,000 to Alice Johnson" [...] in the margin, but does not sign or date the writing in the margin, most states would find that Tom had revoked the earlier provision, but had not effectively amended his will to add the second; however, under DRR the revocation would be undone because Tom was acting under the mistaken belief that he could increase the gift to $7,000 by writing that in the margin. Therefore, Alice will get 5,000 dollars. However, the doctrine of relative revocation will not apply if the <b>interlineation</b> decreases the amount of the gift from the original provision (e.g., [...] "$5,000 to Alice Johnson" [...] is crossed out and replaced with [...] "$3,000 to Alice Johnson" [...] without Testator's signature or the date in the margin; DRR does not apply and Alice Johnson will take nothing).|$|E

5000|$|On November 9, 1835, Smith {{dictated}} {{an account}} of the First Vision in his diary after telling it to a stranger who had visited his home earlier that day. Smith said that when perplexed about religions matters, he had gone to a grove to pray but that his tongue seemed swollen in his mouth and that he had been interrupted twice by the sound of someone walking behind him. Finally, as he prayed, he said his tongue was loosed, and he saw a pillar of fire in which an unidentified [...] "personage" [...] appeared. Then another unidentified personage told Smith his sins were forgiven and [...] "testified unto Smith that Jesus Christ is the Son of God." [...] An <b>interlineation</b> in the text notes, [...] "and I saw many angels in this vision." [...] Smith said this vision occurred when he was 14 years old and that when he was 17, he [...] "saw another vision of angels in the night season after I had retired to bed" [...] (referring to the later visit of the angel Moroni who showed him the location of the golden plates). Smith identified none of these personages or angels with [...] "the Lord" [...] as he had in 1832.|$|E

40|$|Presentation of the {{importance}} of medieval woman by the study of portuguese cronicles from the 14 th to 16 th centuries about three queens: Mecia Lopes of Haro, Matilde of Bologne and Beatriz. These cronicles had been written to explain the governation of the ladies’ husbands, respectively Sancho II, king deposed of Portugal in 1245 and his brother Afonso III, responsible for the deposition and king from 1248 until 1279, year of his death. It is possible to see a little of these women in the <b>interlineation</b> of the texts. While Matilde and Beatriz represent the woman-merchandize, as elements of the nobility to garantee to men properties and titles – reason by which Afonso III has got married for the second time when he was already married – Mécia represents the role of the devil-woman, the Eve-sinner, who thanks to her "whitchcrafts" and "bad advises" has taken his husband to be deposed from the power...|$|E

No statement of his can be accepted without verification, and no manuscript he has handled without careful examination, but he did much useful work. He compiled a valuable Bibliographical and Critical Account of the Rarest Books in the English Language (1865); he reprinted {{a great number of}} early English tracts of extreme rarity and rendered good service to the numerous antiquarian societies with which he was connected, especially in the editions he produced for the Camden Society and the Percy Society.|$|R

60|$|We have, of course, no {{evidence}} that anything was done by Government, or by any one, for Mrs. Sprot and the children.

The official draft of his last moments (from its <b>interlineations,</b> each signed by the Clerk of Council) appears to have been drawn up on the spot, or hurriedly, as soon as Sprot was dead. This is the aspect of the draft of the account; the official printed account says that there was ‘no place of writing on the scaffold, in respect of the press and multitude of people’ (Pitcairn, ii. 261).|$|R
60|$|From these causes little {{progress}} {{had been made}} in our work when I was deprived of my coadjutor. But from that time you can testify of me that I have not been idle. You can bear witness to the confused state in which the materials that compose the present volume came into my hands. The difficulty of reading many of the manuscripts, obscured by innumerable erasures, corrections, <b>interlineations,</b> and marginal insertions, would perhaps have been insuperable to any person less conversant in the manuscripts of Mr. Burke than myself. To this difficulty succeeded that of selecting from several detached papers, written upon the same subject and the same topics, such as appeared to contain the author's last thoughts and emendations. When these difficulties were overcome, there still remained, in many instances, that of assigning its proper place to many detached members of the same piece, where no direct note of connection had been made. These circumstances, whilst they will lead the reader not to expect, in the cases to which they apply, the finished productions of Mr. Burke, imposed upon me a task of great delicacy and difficulty,--namely, that of deciding upon the publication of any, and which, of these unfinished pieces. I must here beg permission of you, and Lord Fitzwilliam, to inform the public, that in the execution of this part of my duty I requested and obtained your assistance.|$|R
6000|$|I shall now {{mention a}} {{particular}} wherein {{your whole body}} will be certainly against me, and the laity almost to a man on my side. However it came about, I cannot get over the prejudice of taking some little offence at the clergy for perpetually reading their sermons[6]; perhaps my frequent hearing of foreigners, who never made use of notes, may have added to my disgust. And I cannot but think, that whatever is read, differs as much from what is repeated without book, as a copy does from an original. At the same time, I am highly sensible what an extreme difficulty it would be upon you to alter this method, and that, in such a case, your sermons would be much less valuable than they are, for want of time to improve and correct them. I would therefore gladly come to a compromise with you in this matter. I knew a clergyman of some distinction, who appeared to deliver his sermon without looking into his notes, which when I complimented him upon, he assured me he could not repeat six lines; but his method was to write the whole sermon in a large plain hand, with all the forms of margin, paragraph, marked page, and the like; then on Sunday morning he took care to run it over five or six times, which he could do in an hour; and when he deliver'd it, by pretending to turn his face {{from one side to}} the other, he would (in his own expression) pick up the lines, and cheat his people by making them believe he had it all by heart. He farther added, that whenever he happened by neglect to omit any of these circumstances, the vogue of the parish was, [...] "Our doctor gave us but an indifferent sermon to-day." [...] Now among us, many clergymen act too directly contrary to this method, that from a habit of saving time and paper, which they acquired at the University, they write in so diminutive a manner, with such frequent blots and <b>interlineations,</b> that they are hardly able to go on without perpetual hesitations or extemporary expletives: And I desire to know what can be more inexcusable, than to see a divine and a scholar, at a loss in reading his own compositions, which it is supposed he has been preparing with much pains and thought for the instruction of his people? The want of a little more care in this article, is the cause of much ungraceful behaviour. You will observe some clergymen with their heads held down from the beginning to the end, within an inch of the cushion, to read what is hardly legible; which, besides the untoward manner, hinders them from making the best advantage of their voice: others again have a trick of popping up and down every moment from their paper to the audience, like an idle school-boy on a repetition day.|$|R
