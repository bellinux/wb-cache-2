5|$|The forest {{maintains}} a full-time fire staff throughout the summer, {{not only to}} control and extinguish fires that pose threats to people and structures but also to set controlled burns. Their jobs include maintaining {{a high level of}} preparedness, keeping a vigilant lookout for fire activity, responding to reports of fires, maintaining equipment, monitoring weather and relative atmospheric dryness, and preparing daily fire activity reports, which are used to post fire information for visitors and staff. The forest has wildland fire engines, pumps, hand tools and fire hose at its disposal. A helicopter can be summoned quickly, along with support from the South Central Idaho Interagency Dispatch Center, including a team of smokejumpers and air tankers used to provide air support in dropping flame retardant and water. There are small areas around Stanley and Mount Harrison where aerial retardant would not be used {{in the case of a}} fire. The 10-member Sawtooth <b>Helitack</b> <b>crew</b> was established in 1963 and is based at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey. In the case of larger fires, the National Interagency Fire Command can quickly mobilize available resources. Only four of the original fire lookout towers remain standing in the forest, but they are no longer in use: Iron Mountain, Horton Peak, Lookout Mountain, and Mount Harrison, which was last fully staffed in 2007. Many of these towers were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Helitack</b> <b>crews</b> {{are often}} {{considered}} to be elite members of the firefighting community, {{partly because of the}} experience levels required to qualify as a crew member. CDF Captain Jim Barthol, {{in an interview with the}} San Diego Union-Tribune, used the analogy of runners in a race to compare helitack with other handcrews. He said that [...] "ground-based hand crews are marathon runners, while <b>helitack</b> <b>crews</b> work more like sprinters. Other hand crews might spend three days or more fighting a fire, we might work three different incidents in one day. It doesn't necessarily make us better than those other guys.

5000|$|CAL FIRE {{began using}} contractor-owned {{helicopters}} for fire {{control in the}} mid-1960s. Bell 47, Hiller FH1100, Bell 206 JetRangers and Aerospatiale Alouettes were used the most through the 1970s. The helicopters were located at CAL FIRE facilities which protected high value timberlands and critical watershed areas generally in Northern and Central California with one located at Ryan Field in Southern California. The helicopter began playing an increasing role in the Department's Initial Attack strategy during the late 70s. In 1978 three Bell 205 medium helicopters were hired {{in addition to the}} standby helicopters. One helicopter was located at the Howard Forest, Mendocino Ranger Unit Headquarters. The other two were located at Hemet/Ryan Field and the Monte Vista, San Diego Ranger Unit Headquarters. Each of the medium helicopters was assigned 11 person <b>helitack</b> <b>crews.</b> Unfortunately, in the mid to late 1970s CAL FIRE experienced an increased accident rate throughout the helicopter program. Five accidents involving contractor-owned Bell Jet Rangers occurred in 1979.|$|R
5000|$|Helicopters {{used for}} {{helitack}} missions are usually utility helicopters, {{selected for both their}} lifting capability {{as well as}} their large cabin size to accommodate the <b>helitack</b> <b>crew.</b>|$|E

This crew staffs a UH-1 H helicopter with call sign Copter 101. The <b>helitack</b> <b>crew</b> logs {{an average of}} 412 flight hours per year and responds to both fires and medical emergencies.|$|E
50|$|September 13, 2004 - While {{fighting}} {{a fire in}} the Stanislaus National Forest in northern California, seven members of a CDF <b>helitack</b> <b>crew</b> were engulfed in the flames when the wind shifted in their direction. The gust lasted for no more than 30 seconds, but one firefighter was killed and several of the survivors were critically burned.|$|E
5000|$|A {{helitack}} helicopter {{will launch}} {{with a crew}} on board, drop them {{in the vicinity of}} the fire (or [...] "incident") where they will begin clearing a firebreak with standard hand tools, while the helicopter can then support the team with water drops, either with a Bambi bucket or airframe-mounted water tanks, or ferry in additional personnel (e.g., hotshot crews). If the fire continues to grow beyond the initial attack phase, the mission of the <b>helitack</b> <b>crew</b> shifts to a support role, locating and operating at helispots and helibases, where the coordination of the support required for other firefighting helicopters.|$|E
50|$|The use of helicopter-delivered fire {{resources}} {{varies by}} agency. Often, helitack crews perform duties {{similar to other}} initial attack crews. Two or three firefighters will be dispatched to a newly reported fire. Helitack crews are usually used for initial attack on fires that are difficult for other firefighters to access, or on extended fires that require aerial support {{in the form of}} water drops, cargo delivery, crew shuttling, or reconnaissance. A typical initial attack response by a <b>helitack</b> <b>crew</b> involves flying to the fire via helicopter and spending one to three days (although sometimes much longer) putting the fire out before hiking to the nearest road for pickup.|$|E
5000|$|In 1960 the Division of Forestry {{decided to}} {{experiment}} with a small, skilled initial attack, or [...] "helitack" [...] crew to be transported by helicopter to increase the early arrival of manpower and equipment to an initial attack fire. Although the crews were trained for hover jumping and had purchased heli-jump suits from the US Forest Service, it was never found necessary to make a jump. Six helitack bases were established in the early 1970s. They were staffed with contracted Bell JetRangers. A typical CAL FIRE <b>helitack</b> <b>crew</b> which responded with the helicopter consisted of one fire captain and two to three seasonal firefighters.|$|E
50|$|A highly {{effective}} way to fight wilderness fire when no roads are nearby is to have wildland firefighters rappel from a helicopter. These firefighters then take suppressive action on the fire or clear a safe landing zone to receive additional firefighters if the fire is too large. Rappellers usually carry 30 pounds of personal gear plus up to 300 pounds of fire gear which is lowered down to them from their helicopter. Rappelling heights can range from 30 feet (in tall, continuous brush) to 250 feet (in timber). When suppression is complete on rappel fires, ground transport is typically arranged {{to pick up the}} firefighters at the nearest road. These crews carry chainsaws, hand tools, radios, and can even have 75 gal water bags, known as blivets, flown in to help fight the fire. When not rappelling, the crew works as a <b>helitack</b> <b>crew</b> and can fly or hike to any regular fire.|$|E
5000|$|When CAL Fire {{began to}} develop a {{helitack}} program in 1970, {{it was decided that}} helitack bases would be established in areas where they could most easily protect high-value timberlands and critical watershed areas in northern and central California. [...] Subsequently two bases were created for Mendocino County and the surrounding area to protect the high-value timber industry in this region. Starting in 1972, the first was located at Laytonville Fire Station, with call sign Copter 101. The second was an Evergreen contract Bell 205A1 (50 Romeo) starting in 1977 at CDF's Howard Forest Fire Station near the town of Willits, California, with call sign of Copter 100. Copter 100 performed the first rope rapelling at Howard Forest, and demonstrated the value and function of the Medium Helicopter for California firefighting. In 1981, Laytonville helitack moved and Copter 101 established at its current location at Howard Forest; Copter 100 and its <b>helitack</b> <b>crew</b> was disbanded. Laytonville's helipad and fueling facilities are still maintained as a secondary base and mid-mission refueling location.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of the accidents, CAL FIRE decided that better {{approach}} would be for the agency to own and operate its own helicopters. In 1981, CAL FIRE leased 12 excess UH-1F Hueys which had previously been used by the USAF in Vietnam. Nine helicopters were initially reconditioned, and were operated as non-certificated, public-use aircraft. The first helicopter was built up November, 1981 and was placed in service at Hemet-Ryan Helitack Base. Six more F Model Hueys were built up and placed in service at helitack bases throughout California in the summer of 1982. During the first two years CAL FIRE employed “Personal Service Contract” pilots. Each base was assigned a full-time pilot and a seasonal relief pilot who covered two bases. The majority of the contract pilots became state employees in 1984. The helitack unit was designed to be a cohesive unit which consisted of the helicopter and <b>helitack</b> <b>crew.</b> A typical configuration for the helicopter was a Helitack Fire Captain in the copilot's seat and a Helitack Fire Captain plus six fire-fighters in the passenger compartment. The water bucket was replaced in 1984 with a newly designed Canadian 324-gallon Bambi bucket. In the mid-1980s, fixed water dropping tanks were installed on several helicopters. Water bucket operations over ever-increasing populated regions in the urban interface areas of eastern Riverside County had been causing a concern. An accidental drop of a water bucket could cause catastrophic results, while a fixed tank reduced the exposure. In addition, some areas where the helicopters operated had few water sources from which a helicopter could fill its bucket. A fixed tank allowed the helicopter to obtain water from sources previously unobtainable with the bucket.|$|E

An investigation ensued. Questions were asked, and many were answered. Others were not or could not be answered, and new questions and controversies surfaced. All too often, fire behavior is pinned as a major culprit in burnover fatalities and entrapments, usually associated with terms such as “extreme, ” “sudden, ” and “unexpected. ” But while extreme fire behavior has been a common denominator, it is not unusual, and should seldom be unexpected. Wildland fire behavior covers a wide and diverse spectrum, from creeping, smoldering ground fires to intense and sometimes explosive crown fires. This has always been so. Safe and effective suppression operations under extreme conditions are common, and extreme fire behavior – including crown fire – is sometimes an acceptable or even desired event on fir...|$|E
40|$|On September 12, 2004, a 24 -year-old female career fire fighter (the victim) {{died while}} {{conducting}} an initial attack at a wildland fire. A <b>Helitack</b> <b>crew</b> responded {{in a helicopter}} to a wildland fire in a remote river drainage with slopes ranging from 80 to 120 percent. The crew began constructing an indirect downhill handline from a forest service road {{in an attempt to}} establish an anchor point at the river. A wind shift caused the fire to make an upslope run into the crew. Four crew members ran downhill toward the river while the victim and another fire fighter ran uphill toward another crew member standing on the road. The victim was overrun by fire and later pronounced dead at the scene. - NIOSH investigators concluded that, to minimize the risk of similar occurrences, fire departments and fire service agencies should: (1) Ensure that crews are able to reach a safety zone(s) quickly when deciding to construct a downhill/indirect handline in steep terrain. (2) Ensure that officers establish an initial attack plan that allows for the fire to be fought aggressively, but provides for the protection and safety of fire fighters first. (3) Ensure that crews fully comply with "The Standard Fire Orders". (4) Ensure that individual crews establish Lookouts, Communications, Escape Routes and Safety Zones (LCES) prior to fighting the fire. "January 13, 2006. "Includes bibliographical references...|$|E
