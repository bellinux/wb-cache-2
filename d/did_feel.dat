5|$|In February 1950, Pontecorvo's Harwell {{colleague}} Klaus Fuchs {{was arrested}} for espionage, and the AERE began to take security more seriously, and Pontecorvo was interviewed by Henry Arnold, the security officer at AERE. While Arnold had no evidence that Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy, he <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> {{that he was a}} security risk, and recommended that he be moved to a position where he did not have access to Top Secret material. Herbert Skinner suggested to Pontecorvo that he apply for a newly created professorship at the University of Liverpool, where Skinner held the Lyon Jones chair of experimental physics. In June 1950, Pontecorvo was offered the position.|$|E
5|$|When {{developing}} {{plans for}} Blood-C, {{it was decided}} to shift its setting based on positive feedback from the change of setting between Blood: The Last Vampire and the franchise's first anime series Blood+. The only elements to be retained were the first name of the main character, having a katana as her weapon, and the basic premise of her defeating monsters with that sword. The wish for the project to be distinct from earlier entries was what spurred the collaboration with CLAMP, which became {{a large part of the}} anime's marketing campaign. Fujisaku, when asked in an interview to describe his one creative ambition for the series, said that it was to fully expand and build upon the basic concept established in Blood: The Last Vampire. The choice of a school setting, the first of its kind to be featured in the Blood franchise, was chosen because Mizushima wanted to portray a school life for Saya. When asked, Mizushima did not find the change from his previous comedy anime-based turnout a barrier to his work, but <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> pressure when handling a project within the Blood franchise.|$|E

25|$|During the First World War, {{there was}} {{virtually}} no female {{presence in the}} Canadian armed forces, {{with the exception of}} the 3141 nurses serving overseas and on the home front. Of these women, 328 had been decorated by King George V, and 46 gave their lives in the line of duty. Even though a number of these women received decorations for their efforts, many high-ranking military personnel still felt that they were unfit for the job. Although the Great War, had not officially been opened up to women, they <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> the pressures at home. There had been a gap in employment when the men enlisted; many women strove to fill this void along with keeping up with their responsibilities at home.|$|E
25|$|In November 1839 Cauchy {{was elected}} to the Bureau, and {{discovered}} immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with. Without his oath, the king refused to approve his election. For four years Cauchy was in the absurd position of being elected, but not being approved; hence, he was not a formal member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in meetings, and could not submit papers. Still Cauchy refused to take any oaths; however, he <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> loyal enough to direct his research to celestial mechanics. In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the Academy. He also described and illustrated the signed-digit representation of numbers, an innovation presented in England in 1727 by John Colson. The confounded membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when Cauchy was finally replaced by Poinsot.|$|E
500|$|The second episode, [...] "The Writer", was {{released}} on 12 October 2010. Erik Brudvig of IGN called it a must-buy for anyone that already purchased [...] "The Signal", and said it satisfyingly closed out the game's story.

500|$|Mathews <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> the King Island {{form was}} distinctive, being larger and having more {{red in the}} plumage than Tasmanian populations and so {{described}} it as P. c. henriettae in 1915. This has since been reclassified as a synonym of P. c. brownii as its status has been recognized as distinct from the Tasmanian mainland taxonâ€”now known as P. c. caledonicus. Mathews also described [...] P. c. flindersi from Flinders Island in 1917, {{on the basis of}} darker plumage. It is now considered as not distinct from the Tasmanian mainland subspecies.|$|E
500|$|A year later, Moore {{still did}} not {{understand}} the controversy that caused photos of a naked, pregnant woman to be viewed as morally objectionable. Moore stated that, [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> glamorous, beautiful and more free about my body. I don't know how much more family oriented I could possibly have gotten." [...] She considered the cover to be a healthy [...] "feminist statement." [...] In 2007, Moore stated that the picture was not originally intended for publication. [...] She had posed in a personal photo session, not a cover shoot. [...] Leibovitz has had personal photo sessions of Moore and all of her daughters.|$|E
500|$|William Kowalski in The Globe and Mail {{questioned}} why {{the book}} was not released as a memoir as {{there are times when}} Irving appears to have modeled Danny [...] "literally after himself". He complained that it was these passages that tended to [...] "bog down" [...] the story. Kowalski called the novel [...] "a flawed but mature work by one of our most accomplished writers". For Rene Rodriguez in the Los Angeles Times, the highlight of {{the book was}} the attention it gave to the bond between Dominic and his son, but she <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> that the details of the creative process should have been relegated to an essay.|$|E

500|$|Dooley {{is not a}} well {{established}} character in the comics, so Whigham created his own background for him, feeling that [...] "Dooley is [...] a political appointee. I think I worked my way up through good hard work." [...] Unlike {{many of the other}} agents, Whigham believes that Dooley does respect Carter, saying [...] "I think he likes her. I think he cares deeply. I'm not sure that he can always show that". When asked whether Dooley's death was what brings Carter and the other SSR agents together, Fazekas said that this was not necessarily the case, as Carter had already begun to earn that herself, but she <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> that it [...] "sort of focuses everyone and affects everyone".|$|E
500|$|A [...] "working mom", as {{described}} by Paltrow, Elizabeth is the central figure in the detective process. Despite being among the virus' first victims, Paltrow believed that Elizabeth was [...] "lucky", as she thought the disease's survivors were being left {{to deal with the}} newly difficult conditions of everyday life, such as finding food and potable water. When on location in Hong Kong, Paltrow was instructed by Soderbergh to take photographs {{to be used in the}} film, and admitted she was apprehensive about the assignment. [...] "I was just another tourist taking pictures", she said, and added, [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> a little pressure. When Steven Soderbergh gives you a photo assignment, you had better come back with something decent." ...|$|E
500|$|Biller and {{executive}} producer Jeri Taylor were critical of Glassner's pitch; Biller {{found it to be}} [...] "very melodramatic and hokey", and Taylor called it [...] "a tired idea" [...] and [...] "too on the nose for B'Elanna." [...] Producer Brannon Braga explained that the decision to purchase the concept was to do a storyline involving an evil twin in the show's first season, and [...] "get it out of the way." [...] He <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> that the concept could be a mistake, and compared it negatively to a hypothetical storyline in which [...] character Data (Brent Spiner) would be made human. Piller said the episode was almost abandoned, but he believed that the conflict between Torres' human and Klingon halves, and her identity as a woman, would make a worthwhile storyline.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Bass {{stated that}} he had faith Timberlake would return after six months off to record another album with NSYNC, and that he felt betrayed by Timberlake's 2004 {{decision}} to pursue his solo career instead. Bass has {{also said that he}} has little hope for a reunion, since Timberlake has [...] "made it clear that he wouldn't be interested in discussing another album any time soon." [...] Despite these statements, Bass has denied that he harbors any ill feelings towards Timberlake, saying: [...] "At that time... it <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> like betrayal. I felt heartbroken. All these emotions went through me. Today, Iâ€™m really happy, and Justin and I are really great friends. I donâ€™t hate him at all. And I understand what he was going through, and it was as hard for him as it was for any of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Digital Spy {{listed the}} episode on an unranked {{list of the}} five best Veronica Mars episodes, writing that it [...] "has its issues" [...] but that [...] "the rooftop {{sequence}} with Veronica, Cassidy (Kyle Gallner) and Logan is pure, gorgeous melodrama, and Keith's fake-out death feels devastating instead of cheap thanks to Kristen Bell's gut-wrenching performance." [...] In {{a list of the}} 50 greatest TV shows of all time, Empire noted [...] "Not Pictured" [...] as the best episode of the series. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote that he was [...] "very pleased with how things turned out" [...] and that the twist fit with the evidence. However, he was more critical of Keith's near-death, writing, [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> like piling on, however, was Beaver 'killing' Keith. Kristen Bell tried her best to sell it, but I wasn't buying." [...] Entertainment Weekly called the episode one of the [...] "10 Essential Episodes" [...] of Veronica Mars.|$|E
500|$|In {{his last}} full {{season with the}} Indians in 1955, Doby was {{selected}} for his seventh consecutive and final All-Star Game. Doby's leg injuries affected him severely {{at this point in}} his career and he did not enter the game. He finished the 1955 season with 26 home runs and 75 RBIs while hitting [...]291 in 131 games, his fewest played since 1948. Not all in Cleveland were disappointed to see Doby leaving. Wrote one Plain Dealer columnist, Franklin Lewis: [...] "He has been a controversial athlete. Highly gifted, he was frequently morose, sullen, and upon occasion, downright surly to his teammates... He thought of himself, at the beginning, as the symbol of the Negro in his league." [...] Doby responded, [...] "I was looked on as a Black man, not as a human being. I <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> a responsibility to the Black players who came after me, but that was a responsibility, basically, to people, not just to Black people." ...|$|E

500|$|She {{also was}} seen by [...] others as a sex symbol. Aaliyah {{did not have a}} problem with being {{considered}} one. [...] "I know that people think I'm sexy and I am looked at as that, and it is cool with me," [...] she stated. [...] "It's wonderful to have sex appeal. If you embrace it, it can be a very beautiful thing. I am totally cool with that. Definitely. I see myself as sexy. If you are comfortable with it, it can be very classy and it can be very appealing." [...] The single [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] was argued to have transformed [...] "the once tomboy into a sexy grown woman". Aaliyah mentioned that her mother, during her childhood, would take pictures of her and notice a sex appeal. She reinforced her mother's belief by saying that she <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> [...] "sexy for sure" [...] and that she embraced it and was comfortable with this view of her.|$|E
500|$|Universal {{makeup artist}} Jack Pierce paid special {{attention}} to the Monster's appearance in this film. He altered his 1931 design to display the after-effects of the mill fire, adding scars and shortening the Monster's hair. Over the course of filming, Pierce modified the Monster's makeup to indicate that the Monster's injuries were healing as the film progressed. Pierce co-created the Bride's makeup with strong input from Whale, especially regarding the Bride's iconic hair style, based on Nefertiti. Lanchester's hair was given a Marcel wave over a wire frame to achieve the style. Lanchester disliked working with Pierce, who she said [...] "really <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> that he made these people, like he was a god... in the morning he'd be dressed in white as if he were in hospital to perform an operation." [...] To play Mary Shelley, Lanchester wore a white net dress embroidered with sequins of butterflies, stars, and moons, which the actress had heard required 17 women 12 weeks to make.|$|E
500|$|Terri Schwartz of IGN {{scored the}} premiere 8 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "great" [...] episode, and praising {{the introduction of}} Ghost Rider and subsequent darker tone which [...] "will eventually allow [...] to sit more comfortably beside its corporate cousins over on Netflix". Schwartz was positive about the smaller cast compared to the previous season, which meant that the episode [...] "doesn't feel as overstuffed as it would have", and of Coulson not finding Johnson and asking her to return to S.H.I.E.L.D. straight away after the newly established status quo. Schwartz <b>did</b> <b>feel</b> {{that there were some}} [...] "growing pains" [...] with the transition to more mature material, particularly criticizing the [...] "sexy" [...] opening of the episode with Johnson because [...] "S.H.I.E.L.D. has already done a great job establishing Daisy as a sexy character without needing to depict it in this unsubtle way. Hopefully the inclusion of more overt sexuality in the show feels a bit more organic to the show as it continues".|$|E
