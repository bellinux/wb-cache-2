China became an observer of GATT in 1982 and formally applied to participate as a full member in July 1986. China also reversed its aversion to foreign capital, borrowing money from international lending organizations, foreign governments, and foreign commercial banks and consortia and permitting foreign banks to open branches in China. The Chinese government maintained a <b>good</b> <b>credit</b> rating internationally and did not pile up huge foreign debts like many other communist and developing countries. Between 1979 and 1985, China signed loans totaling US$20.3 billion, US$15.6 billion of which it already had used. Most loans went into infrastructure projects, such as energy and transportation, and funded raw materials imports. The Bank of China, the principal foreign exchange bank, established branches overseas and participated in international financial markets in Eurobonds and loan syndication.|$|E
500|$|Cox {{left his}} job as an {{insurance}} agent {{to work as a}} mortgage broker for a local company. While there he developed a reputation for unscrupulousness, which was heightened by his authorship of an unpublished 317-page manuscript entitled The Associates. The novel's protagonist, who shares many traits in common with Cox, travels the country committing mortgage fraud. Cox told co-workers about the book, and elaborated its details to them. [...] "He sent it {{to a lot of people}} to see if they thought it worked" [...] said a former co-worker. After being fired from the company when he was convicted of mortgage fraud in 2002, Cox faked a <b>good</b> <b>credit</b> history, and used that to buy dozens of homes and properties. In one instance he used the social security number of a toddler, and all of his documents—references, bank letters, rent receipts, W-2s from nonexistent employees—were counterfeit. He used his skills as an artist to decorate the properties with elaborate art deco-style murals. Several of his future girlfriends said that his painting talents were part of his allure, though the St. Petersburg Times described his works as copies of murals by Tamara de Lempicka. Cox charmed Alison Arnold, a young local married woman, into believing he could give her a wealthy and luxurious life. While courting Arnold she said he took her to crime films such as The Italian Job and Catch Me if You Can—which he reportedly adored and watched several times—and detailed his criminal plans to her.|$|E

These mass mailings were known as [...] "drops" [...] in banking terminology, and were outlawed in 1970 due to the financial chaos they caused. However, by the time the law came into effect, approximately 100 million credit cards had been dropped into the U.S. population.

He made agreements with the major fifty-five banks of Eurooe, and issued bonds which, based on the <b>good</b> <b>credit</b> of France, brought in more than the amount required. Thiers signed a new convention with Germany on 15 March 1873, calling for the Germans to leave [...] the last four French departments they held, Ardennes, Vosges, Meurthe-sur Moselle and Meuse by July 1873, two years ahead of schedule. Germany retained only the fortress of Verdun, and the territory of a radius of three kilometers around it.

The right wing deputies [...] abstained, but it passed with the full support of the republicans.

40|$|In Macfarlane v.

The early-release credit systems unconstitutionally provide fewer early-release credits to pre-trial detainees who cannot afford to post bail than to similarly-situated prisoners who post bail and serve their entire sentences after trial in state prison. The court held that awarding fewer <b>good</b> behavior <b>credits</b> for time served in county jail than for time served in state prison denies {{equal protection of the}} law to pre-trial detainees who serve part of their sentences in county jail due to lack of funds to post bail, because the court found no relationship between the state 2 ̆ 7 s purpose of maintaining prisoner discipline and offering fewer <b>good</b> behavior <b>credits.</b> However, in the case of <b>good</b> performance <b>credits,</b> the court held that excluding pre-trial detainees from earning <b>good</b> performance <b>credits</b> for participation in work or treatment programs does not deny equal protection of the law because there is a relationship between the state 2 ̆ 7 s purpose of preventing flight from prosecution and excluding pre-trial detainees from participating in off-site work or treatment programs...|$|R

60|$|But, then, {{let me add}} a caution {{here for}} the best of tradesmen not to neglect--namely, as the {{tradesman}} should take care to pay his bills and notes currently, so, that he may do it, he must be careful what notes he issues out, and how he suffers others to draw on him. He that is careful of his reputation in business, will also be cautious not to let any man he deals with over draw him, or draw upon him before the money drawn for his due. And as to notes promissory, or under his hand, he is careful not to give out such notes but on good occasions, and where he has the effects in his hand to answer them; this keeps his cash whole, and preserves his ability of performing and punctually paying when the notes become due; and the want of this caution has ruined the reputation of a tradesman many times, when he might otherwise have preserved himself in as <b>good</b> <b>credit</b> and condition as other men.|$|E
60|$|On {{this account}} he was {{naturally}} but little known in Wessex, and {{was but a}} slight acquaintance of the gentleman at whose mansion he was a guest. However, the friendship {{between him and the}} Heymeres--as the uncle and niece were named--warmed and warmed by degrees, there being but few folk o' note in the vicinity at that time, which made a newcomer, if he were at all sociable and of <b>good</b> <b>credit,</b> always sure of a welcome. A tender feeling (as it is called by the romantic) sprang up between the two young people, which ripened into intimacy. Anderling, the foreign gentleman, was of an amorous temperament; and, though he endeavoured to conceal his feeling, it could be seen that Miss Maria Heymere had impressed him rather more deeply than would be represented by a scratch upon a stone. He seemed absolutely unable to free himself from her fascination; and his inability to do so, much as he tried--evidently thinking he had not the ghost of a chance with her--gave her the pleasure of power; though she more than sympathized when she overheard him heaving his deep drawn sighs--privately to himself, as he supposed.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{besides the}} painters, he had, {{as he has}} {{informed}} us, the other society of Rome. Every winter there is a gay and pleasant English colony in that capital, of course more or less remarkable for rank, fashion, and agreeability with every varying year. In Clive's year some very pleasant folks set up their winter quarters in the usual foreigners' resort round about the Piazza di Spagna. I was amused to find, lately, looking over the travels of the respectable M. de Poellnitz, that, a hundred and twenty years ago, the same quarter, the same streets and palaces, scarce changed from those days, were even then polite foreigners' resort. Of {{one or two of}} the gentlemen Clive had made the acquaintance in the hunting-field; others he had met during his brief appearance in the London world. Being a youth of great personal agility, fitted thereby to the graceful performance of polkas, etc.; having good manners, and good looks, and <b>good</b> <b>credit</b> with Prince Poloni, or some other banker, Mr. Newcome was thus made very welcome to the Anglo-Roman society; and as kindly received in genteel houses, where they drank tea and danced the galop, as in those dusky taverns and retired lodgings where his bearded comrades, the painters held their meetings.|$|E
40|$|Statistics {{show that}} the sale of <b>goods</b> on <b>credit</b> is {{widespread}} among firms {{even when they are}} capital constrained and thus face relatively high costs in providing trade credit. This study provides an explanation for this by arguing that customers that possess strong market power are able to increase their customer surplus by demanding to purchase the <b>goods</b> on <b>credit.</b> This gain in customer surplus increases with the degree of asymmetric information between buyer and seller with respect to product quality. Therefore, firms that are perceived as risky are especially subject to the market power of the customer and have to sell their <b>goods</b> on <b>credit.</b> Using detailed firm-level data from a large number of firms in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, this paper finds evidence consistent with this hypothesis. We find a strong positive correlation between customer market power and trade credit provision. Furthermore, this relationship is especially strong when the supplier is more risky and in countries with limited financial sector development or weak legal system. ...|$|R
