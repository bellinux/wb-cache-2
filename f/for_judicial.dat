5|$|On 10 August, the High Court {{dismissed}} the request <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> review, thus giving the go-ahead {{for the government}} to demolish it. The judge ruled that the applicants had failed to establish that the government had acted perversely.|$|E
5|$|After BC {{became a}} Canadian {{province}} in 1871, Crease devoted {{the next few}} years to fighting <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> independence—specifically the right of judges to live outside their districts. In 1881 the BC Supreme Court, including Crease, ruled in the Thrasher case that the province's attempts to regulate judges were unconstitutional. This decision was overturned two years later by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E
5|$|During this process, the Home Office {{declined}} to give Bamber the expert evidence it had obtained, so Bamber applied <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> review of that decision in November 1994; this resulted in the Home Office handing over its expert evidence. In 1996, without informing Bamber or his lawyers, an Essex police officer destroyed many of the trial exhibits. He {{said he had not}} been aware that the case was ongoing.|$|E

5|$|Holloway's family, however, {{took the}} {{opposite}} approach and criticized the lessening of coverage of her disappearance {{due to a}} shift in news priority when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 23, 2005. The saturation coverage of Holloway's disappearance was finally eclipsed by the hurricane. Beth Twitty and Dave Holloway alleged that Aruba {{took advantage of the}} extensive coverage of Hurricane Katrina to release the suspects, however the deadline <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> review of Van der Sloot's detention was set long before Katrina.|$|E
5|$|The Court also {{rejected}} {{the proposition that}} the principle of proportionality be recognized as a separate ground <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> review. Rather, it should be subsumed under irrationality, in the sense that if an executive decision is disproportionate it can be said to be irrational in that no reasonable authority could have come to such a decision.|$|E
5|$|The test <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> {{review on}} matters not {{relating}} to the ISA remains the objective test. In Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs (1992), the High Court held that validity of detention under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act is not dependent on the Minister's subjective satisfaction. Rather, the Minister must be objectively satisfied that the person was associated with criminal activities.|$|E

5|$|Threshold {{issues are}} legal {{requirements}} in Singapore administrative law {{that must be}} satisfied by applicants before their claims <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> review of acts or decisions of public authorities {{can be dealt with}} by the High Court. These include showing that they have standing (locus standi) to bring cases, and that the matters are amenable to judicial review and justiciable by the Court.|$|E
5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave to apply <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> review. Justiciability recognizes the limited {{capabilities of the}} courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, {{due to the nature}} of the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|Beginning work in 2011, the TIRC has {{referred}} 17 cases to {{the circuit court}} <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> review for potential relief. Three convicts have been freed based on review of their cases. Individuals may initiate claims to the commission. As of April 2016, another 130 cases have been heard of torture that was not committed by Burge or his subordinates. The city and state are struggling {{to determine how to}} treat this high number of torture victims in a just way. The sponsors of the bill tried to amend it in 2014 to expand its scope to all claims of torture by police in Chicago, but were unable to get support in the state house. They will try again.|$|E

5|$|Even {{in modern}} democracies, Freemasonry is {{sometimes}} viewed with distrust. In the UK, Masons {{working in the}} justice system, such as judges and police officers, were from 1999 to 2009 required to disclose their membership. While a parliamentary inquiry found {{that there has been}} no evidence of wrongdoing, it was felt that any potential loyalties Masons might have, based on their vows to support fellow Masons, should be transparent to the public. The policy of requiring a declaration of masonic membership of applicants <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> office (judges and magistrates) was ended in 2009 by Justice Secretary Jack Straw (who had initiated the requirement in the 1990s). Straw stated that the rule was considered disproportionate, since no impropriety or malpractice had been shown as a result of judges being Freemasons.|$|E
5|$|In addition, if civil {{proceedings}} are taken against the Government, section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from granting injunctions against it. In place of an injunction, the Court {{may make a}} declaration concerning the parties' rights. The Court also may not make an injunction against a government officer if the effect of doing so would be to provide relief {{that could not be}} obtained against the Government directly. Section 2(2) of the Act makes it clear that the term {{civil proceedings}} includes proceedings <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> review.|$|E
5|$|In {{the appeal}} against Prakash J.'s {{judgment}} to the Court of Appeal, also called Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Minister for Information and the Arts (1996), {{counsel for the}} appellants argued that the restriction placed by the Minister on the importation, sale and distribution of the Jehovah's Witnesses publications was too wide and disproportionate. Applying an approach similar to that taken in Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. P.P. (1994), the Court of Appeal noted that the appellants were essentially seeking to challenge the view taken by the Minister that Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to carry out National Service {{was a threat to}} national security. The Court regarded this as a non-justiciable issue and declined to allow the appellants to bring an application <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> review of Order No. 405/1995.|$|E

After {{employees of the}} Liquor Control and Licensing Branch told Ince that the art installation would likely result in the refusal of a special event liquor licence, the party asked <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> review. Both a provincial court and an appeal court refused the review because an actual application had not been submitted for a decision to be reviewed, and the fundraiser went ahead with the serving of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Justice is {{responsible}} for handling legal matters for the government. Its responsibilities include providing legal advice, criminal prosecution, civil representation, legal and policy drafting and reform and international legal co-operation between different jurisdictions. Apart from prosecuting criminal cases, lawyers of the Department of Justice act {{on behalf of the}} government in all civil and administrative lawsuits against the government. As protector of public interest, the department may apply <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> reviews and may intervene in any cases involving the greater public interest. The Basic Law protects the Department of Justice from any interference by the government when exercising its control over criminal prosecution.|$|E
5|$|The {{remedies}} {{available in}} Singapore administrative law are the prerogative orders – the mandatory order (formerly known as mandamus), prohibiting order (prohibition), quashing order (certiorari), and order for review of detention (habeas corpus) – and the declaration, {{a form of}} equitable remedy. In Singapore, administrative law is the branch of law that enables a person to challenge an exercise of power by {{the executive branch of}} the Government. The challenge is carried out by applying to the High Court <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> review. The Court's power to review a law or an official act of a government official is part of its supervisory jurisdiction, and at its fullest may involve quashing an action or decision and ordering that it be redone or remade.|$|E

Cohen stated {{he believed that the}} DRS system was unfair {{for a number of reasons}} and would seek redress against Nominet with the High Court via judicial review. Nominet stated that Cohen should appeal the case via the appeal process in the DRS. Cohen refused and, after several months, instead issued proceedings <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> review. The High Court at first instance rejected Cohen's case in August 2005, noting that Cohen's company, Cyberbritain Group Ltd., should have used the appeal process forming part of Nominet's domain resolution service. Afterward, Cohen's company asked for a rehearing and, as that case progressed, the interim domain name was transferred to Apple in accord with the expert's decision and thereafter pointed to the Apple music site. In November 2005, Cohen dropped all legal action against Apple.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{interest}} that the applicant seeks to represent, standing {{can be categorized}} as either private or public standing. Applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests. In contrast, an applicant who seeks to represent {{the interest}}s of a larger group or {{the public at large}} must establish he or she has public or representative standing. Where private standing is concerned, the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case, but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist: (1) the applicant must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated. The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders. The legal position on public standing in administrative law cases is indeterminate as, to date, no applicant has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> review. In constitutional law cases, the Court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights, and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine private interests to protect or further.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 {{the state}} {{passed a law}} authorizing the Illinois Torture Inquiry Relief Commission, to {{investigate}} cases related to convictions of people claiming to have been tortured by Burge and his officers and given coerced confessions, {{to see if there}} was evidence <b>for</b> <b>judicial</b> review and relief. It started to receive cases in 2011. Seventeen cases have been referred to the circuit court and three men freed by April 2016. Another 130 similar cases of torture by Chicago police have been claimed, beyond the scope of Burge and his cohort. The sponsors are trying to have the bill amended to accommodate these victims. In 2015 the City of Chicago announced that it has established a $5.5 million fund for reparations to victims of torture by Burge, and to aid their families. By that time, the city had paid more than $57 million to victims of Burge and his cohort, and another $50 million for defense of the officers.|$|E
