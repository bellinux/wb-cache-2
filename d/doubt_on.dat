5|$|According to C.H.O'D. Alexander: This {{game was}} notable for two things. First, Fischer played the Queen's Gambit {{for the first}} time in his life in a serious game; second, he played it to perfection, the game indeed casting <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> Black's whole opening system.|$|E

5|$|Once Pluto was found, its faintness {{and lack}} of a resolvable disc cast <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> {{the idea that it}} was Lowell's Planet X. Estimates of Pluto's mass were revised {{downward}} throughout the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Archaeopteryx is a genus of {{theropod}} dinosaur {{closely related}} to the birds. Since the late 19th century, it has been accepted by palaeontologists, and celebrated in lay reference works, as being the oldest known bird, though a study in 2011 has cast <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> this assessment, suggesting instead that it is a non-avialan dinosaur {{closely related to}} the origin of birds.|$|E
5|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill beside the battery are two {{rectangular}} earthworks, 16 metres by 8 metres (52ft and 26ft), and 26 metres and 12 metres (85ft and 39ft). Traditionally these have been thought to be Royalist gun batteries pre-dating the construction of Oliver's Battery, but recent scholarship casts <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> this, suggesting that they are instead the remains of hollow ways and sand pits.|$|E

5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of several dromaeosaurids (Microraptor, Sinornithosaurus, and Velociraptor) and modern birds and {{reptiles}} indicate that some dromaeosaurids (including Microraptor and Velociraptor) {{may have been}} nocturnal predators, while Sinornithosaurus is inferred to be cathemeral (active throughout the day at short intervals). However, the discovery of iridescent plumage in Microraptor has cast <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> the inference of nocturnality in this genus, as no modern birds that have iridescent plumage {{are known to be}} nocturnal.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} investigation, police had noted {{undisturbed}} human excrement {{in the elevator}} shaft, which Conley said he had left there before the murder. Use of the elevator on the Monday after the murder crushed the excrement, which Slaton concluded was {{an indication that the}} elevator could not have been used as described by Conley, casting <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> his testimony.|$|E
5|$|However, , {{with the}} {{exception}} of Spiroplasma mirum strain SMCA causing spongiform microcystic encephalitis in suckling rats, other researchers have been unable to duplicate these findings, casting <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> the Spiroplasma hypothesis. In defense of the Spiroplasma hypothesis, Bastian pointed out that Spiroplasma is hard to culture and that strain variation makes it hard to detect certain strains using PCR and other techniques, thus giving a false negative.|$|E

5|$|Iguanodon was {{recorded}} from Africa based on teeth from Tunisia {{and elsewhere in}} the Sahara, but the description of Lurdusaurus and Ouranosaurus cast <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> African records of Iguanodon. The genus was also recorded from Mongolia based on the description of I. orientalis, and in North America based on I. ottingeri from Utah. Another North American species, from South Dakota, once assigned to Iguanodon as I. lakotaensis, has since been reclassified as the genus Dakotadon.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, actor James Garner claimed {{responsibility}} for the wording of the slogan during an interview with Playboy magazine. Garner, who narrated the original commercial, stated that his first action ever to be captured on film was to misread the line that had been provided to him. However, as noted above, the advertisements first appeared in print before their debut on television, which cast <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> Garner's claim.|$|E
5|$|In a book {{he wrote}} in the 1970s, Audisio argued that the {{decision}} to execute Mussolini taken at the meeting in Dongo of the partisan leaders on 28 April constituted a valid judgment of a tribunal under Article 15 of the CNLAI's ordinance on the Constitution of Courts of War. However, the lack of a judge or a Commissario di Guerra (required by the ordinance to be present) casts <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> this assertion.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{at the end}} of the 14th century, no <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> {{account of}} the devastation caused mid-century by the Black Death, there was a general shift towards less {{expensive}} techniques. Many things which would have earlier been completely forbidden by the guilds were now commonplace (using low quality wool, carding, etc.). In the silk industry, the use of water-powered mills grew, and by the 15th century, the loom designed by Jean le Calabrais saw nearly universal use.|$|E
5|$|The Korean {{investigators}} cast <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> the U.S. report's {{suggestion of}} possible gunfire {{from among the}} refugees. Surviving documents said nothing about infiltrators at No Gun Ri, even though {{they would have been}} the 7th Cavalry's first enemy killed-in-action in Korea. The No Gun Ri survivors denied it emphatically, and only three of 52 battalion veterans interviewed by the U.S. team spoke of hostile fire, and then inconsistently.|$|E

5|$|The {{uncritical}} {{acceptance of}} Price's reports prompted a formal {{study by the}} Society for Psychical Research (SPR), which rejected most of the sightings as either imagined or fabricated and cast <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> Price's credibility. His claims are now generally discredited by ghost historians. Neither the SPR's report nor the more recent biography of Price has quelled public interest in these stories, and new books and television documentaries continue to satisfy public fascination with the rectory.|$|E
5|$|These {{military}} actions left Habré {{in control of}} Chad and {{in a position to}} threaten the expulsion of Libya from the Aouzou Strip, affected the international perception of Libya as a significant regional military power, and cast renewed <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> the competence and determination of Libyan soldiers, especially in engagements beyond the country's borders to which they evidently felt no personal commitment.|$|E
5|$|A {{reported}} {{block on}} player transfers into the club, {{set in place}} by the Hull City board on 28 July 2010 until transfers out would substantially reduce the £39million-per-year wage bill, at first cast <b>doubt</b> <b>on</b> the new manager's efforts to build a squad capable of a quick return to the Premier League; nevertheless, Pearson brought several transfers and loan signings into the club in his bid to strengthen the squad for the season's campaign. The team set a new club record on 12 March 2011 with 14 away matches unbeaten, breaking a previous record held for over 50 years. This 17-match streak was finally broken by Bristol City {{on the last day of}} the 2010–11 season, Hull losing the match 3–0.|$|E
