25|$|The 1970s saw the {{development}} of the financial futures contracts, which allowed trading in the future value of interest rates. These (in particular the 90‑day <b>Eurodollar</b> contract introduced in 1981) had an enormous impact on {{the development}} of the interest rate swap market.|$|E
25|$|When the {{deliverable}} asset {{exists in}} plentiful supply, {{or may be}} freely created, then {{the price of a}} futures contract is determined via arbitrage arguments. This is typical for stock index futures, treasury bond futures, and futures on physical commodities when they are in supply (e.g. agricultural crops after the harvest). However, when the deliverable commodity is not in plentiful supply or when it does not yet exist - for example on crops before the harvest or on <b>Eurodollar</b> Futures or Federal funds rate futures (in which the supposed underlying instrument is to be created upon the delivery date) - the futures price cannot be fixed by arbitrage. In this scenario there is only one force setting the price, which is simple supply and demand for the asset in the future, as expressed by supply and demand for the futures contract.|$|E
500|$|Large {{volumes of}} Arab petrodollars were {{invested}} directly in US Treasury securities {{and in other}} financial markets of the major industrial economies, often directed discreetly by government entities now known as sovereign wealth funds. Many billions of petrodollars were also invested through the major commercial banks of the US and Europe. In fact, the process contributed {{to the growth of}} the <b>Eurodollar</b> market as a less-regulated rival to US monetary markets. As the recessionary condition of the world economy made investment in corporations less attractive, bankers and well-financed governments lent much of the money directly to the governments of developing countries, especially in Latin America such as Brazil and Argentina as well as other major developing nations like Turkey. The 1973 oil crisis had created a vast dollar shortage in these countries; however, they still needed to finance their imports of oil and machinery. In early 1977, when Turkey stopped heating its prime minister's office, opposition leader Suleyman Demirel famously described the shortage as: [...] "Turkey is in need of 70cents." [...] As political journalist William Greider summarized the situation: [...] "Banks collected the deposits of revenue-rich OPEC governments and lent the money to developing nations so they could avoid bankruptcy." [...] In subsequent decades, many of these developing nations found their accumulated debts to be unpayably large, concluding that it was a form of neocolonialism from which debt relief was the only escape.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Eurodollar</b> futures {{contract}} {{refers to the}} financial {{futures contract}} based upon these deposits, traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). More specifically, <b>EuroDollar</b> futures contracts are derivatives on the interest rate paid on those deposits.

5000|$|In United States banking, <b>Eurodollars</b> are {{a popular}} option for {{what are known}} as [...] "sweeps".

To accommodate larger businesses, banks may automatically transfer, or sweep, funds from a corporation's checking account into an overnight investment option to effectively earn interest on those funds. Banks usually allow these funds to be swept either into money market mutual funds, or alternately they may be used for bank funding by transferring to an offshore branch of a bank.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{contractual}} distinctions {{as an explanation}} for the price divergence between futures and forward contracts. Specifically, it investigates the effect of marking-to-market on the observed price differences using the pricing model described in Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1981). Using previously unavailable data, this paper employs <b>Eurodollars,</b> an interest rate-sensitive financial asset, to test the Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross model. Unlike prior empirical studies, test results support both the weak prediction concerning the sign of the average price difference and the stronger prediction that specific covariances explain the variation in the price differences.

5000|$|In the United States, {{federal funds}} are {{overnight}} borrowings between {{banks and other}} entities to maintain their bank reserves at the Federal Reserve. Banks keep reserves at Federal Reserve Banks to meet their reserve requirements and to clear financial transactions. Transactions in the federal funds market enable depository institutions with reserve balances in excess of reserve requirements to lend reserves to institutions with reserve deficiencies. These loans are usually made for one day only, that is, [...] "overnight". The interest rate at which these deals are done is called the federal funds rate. Federal funds are not collateralized; like <b>eurodollars,</b> they are an unsecured interbank loan.|$|R
