To reproduce the measured <b>deposition</b> <b>efficiencies</b> an enhancement factor for the erosion of deposited Mo and W has to be assumed (∼ 10 for Mo and ∼ 25 for W). Due to the rather low electron temperature Te of these plasma conditions (Te∼ 15 eV at the location of injection), Mo and W are mostly sputtered by impurities whereas sputtering due to deuterium is negligible.

Comparisons of experimentally observed initial deposition rates with mass transport rates in parallel-plate-flow-chambers (PPFC) predicted by convective-diffusion yielded <b>deposition</b> <b>efficiencies</b> above unity, despite electrostatic repulsion. It is hypothesized that sedimentation {{is the major}} mass transport mechanism in a PPFC. The contribution of sedimentation to the mass transport in a PPFC was experimentally investigated by introducing a novel microscopy-based method. First, height-dependent bacterial concentrations were measured at different times and flow rates and used to calculate bacterial sedimentation velocities. For Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, a sedimentation velocity of 240 mu m h(- 1) was obtained. Therewith, sedimentation appeared as the predominant contribution to mass transport in a PPFC. Also in the current study, <b>deposition</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of S. aureus ATCC 12600 {{with respect to the}} Smoluchowski-Levich solution of the convective-diffusion equation were four-to-five fold higher than unity.

The cyclophane is transported to a pyrolysis zone where it is 'cracked' to the p-xylylene intermediate.

The economic efficiency of the process depends on the availability of suitable additional system components (suspension feeder, injectors), on the development and handling of stable suspensions, {{as well as on the}} high process stability for acceptance at industrial scale. Special focus is made on thedevelopment and processability of water-based suspensions of ceramic oxides. The use of water as a liquid media for preparing suspensions is often critically discussed due to the necessity of a higher heat input during spraying compared toalcoholic suspensions. In fact, the safe and environmental friendly manufacturing as well as lower production and transport costs clearly speak for the industrial use of aqueous suspensions.

The flow boundary conditions at the peripheral airways are derived from CT images at two lung volumes to produce physiologically-realistic regional ventilation.

The data indicated that the local <b>deposition</b> <b>efficiencies</b> in the first bifurcation increased with a rise in the Stokes number (St) within St range from 0. 0004 to 0. 7.

When the pipe counter-rotates, the Coriolis force pushes the region with high value of nanoparticle mass fraction toward inside edge of the bend. The hot spot deposition region appears inside the edge. The particle deposition over the whole edge of the bend becomes uniform as the Dean number increases. The corotation of pipe makes the particle <b>deposition</b> <b>efficiency</b> a reduction, while high counter-rotation of pipe only slightly affects the <b>deposition</b> <b>efficiency.</b> When two kinds of secondary flows are coexisting, the relative <b>deposition</b> <b>efficiency</b> is larger than that for the stationary case...|$|E
40|$|When the {{electrostatic}} spraying is used correctly, it provides advantages over conventional systems, however many factors {{can affect the}} system efficiency. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to evaluate the charge/mass ratio (Q/M) at different spraying distances (0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 m), and the liquid <b>deposition</b> <b>efficiency</b> on the target. Evaluating the Q/M ratio the Faraday cage method was used and to evaluate the liquid <b>deposition</b> <b>efficiency</b> the artificial targets were positioned longitudinally and transversely to the spray jet. It was found that the spraying distance affects the Q/M ratio, consequently, the liquid <b>deposition</b> <b>efficiency.</b> For the closest distance to the target the Q/M ratio was 4. 11 mC kg- 1, and at distances of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 m, the ratio decreased to 1. 38, 0. 64, 0. 31, 0. 17 and 0. 005 mC kg- 1, respectively. For the liquid deposition, the electrostatic system was affected by the target orientation and spraying distance. The target transversely to the jet of liquid did not improve the liquid deposition, but longitudinally increased the deposition up to 3 meters of distance...|$|E

40|$|High-velocity oxyfuel (HVOF) {{spraying}} of WC- 12 Co {{was performed}} using a feedstock {{in which the}} WC phase was either principally in the micron size range (conventional) or was engineered to contain a significant fraction of nanosized grains (multimodal). Three different HVOF systems and {{a wide range of}} spray parameter settings were used to study the effect of in-flight particle characteristics on coating properties. A process window with respect to particle temperature was identified for producing coatings with the highest resistance to dry abrasion. Although the use of a feedstock containing a nanosized WC phase produced harder coatings, there was little difference in the abrasion resistance of the best-performing conventional and multimodal coatings. However, there is a potential benefit in using the multimodal feedstock due to higher <b>deposition</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and a larger processing window.

40|$|The local re-deposition {{of carbon}} that is {{chemically}} eroded {{from the main}} wall of fusion devices has been experimentally investigated using a specially designed Quartz Microbalance system. The system has been placed in the far SOL of TEXTOR with the front plate parallel to the field lines and CD 4 has been injected in the vicinity. The total re-deposition efficiency on the front plate was about 1 %. Modelling with ERO and the 3 D-GAPS code reproduced the measured <b>deposition</b> <b>efficiencies</b> showing values of 2 %. The remaining difference {{can be attributed to}} chemical re-erosion of the re-deposited C layer by the hydrogen atoms produced from the CD 4 injection. The data show that re-deposition behavior on remote places does not suffer from enhanced erosion, as needed for the plasma wetted area. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
