5|$|In many {{instances}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the incidents more dramatic, would I have sacrificed my main object, {{the desire of}} exhibiting the misery and oppression, peculiar to women, that arise out of the partial laws and customs of society.|$|E
500|$|In Nelson, {{many people}} had thought Brunner dead and he readily {{recognised}} {{that he would not}} have survived his endeavours without the aid of Kehu, writing: [...] "...I found my native Ekehu of much use - invaluable indeed, but the other three rather an encumbrance - <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> better progress without them; but to Ekehu I owe my life - he is a faithful and attached servant." [...] As well as further information about the West Coast, Brunner informed the colony that coal was {{to be found in the}} Grey River valley. However, he also considered, mistakenly, that [...] "there is nothing on the West Coast worth incurring the expense of exploring." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2011, Jenkins {{exited the}} project, citing [...] "creative differences". She stated, [...] "I {{have had a}} great time working at Marvel. We parted on very good terms, and I look forward to working with them again." [...] Jenkins felt she could not have made a good film [...] "out of Thor 2 because I wasn’t the right director... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a great Thor if I could have done the story that I was wanting to do. But I don’t think I was the right person to make a great Thor out of the story they wanted to do." [...] Jenkins had {{intended}} to create a film based on the premise of Romeo and Juliet, where Jane was stuck on Earth with Thor forbidden to come save her. After Thor eventually does travel to Earth, he and Jane would have discovered that Malekith was [...] "hiding the dark energy inside of Earth because he knows that Odin doesn't care about Earth, and so he's using Odin's disinterest in Earth to trick him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ahr chee! Let me swot him one!' {{begged the}} man with the pistol; a most unlovable person. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a friend of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I suppose I {{must accept}} that, and--though I don't know if it's a compliment--I shall go back alone. There's just another matter. If {{you have any}} {{knowledge}} of business <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> you <b>made</b> clerk at the creamery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a dear face, Edward. I've come to say good-bye. I'm {{leaving for}} South Africa to-morrow." [...] And, as her hand touched his, she thought: 'I {{must have been}} mad to think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>have</b> <b>made</b> him love me.' ...|$|R
500|$|Astonishing Stories is not {{remembered as}} {{being among the}} best science fiction magazines: both critic Peter Nicholls and sf writer Jack Williamson have {{described}} it as a [...] "training ground" [...] for writers who would go on to do their best work elsewhere. [...] However, Nicholls adds that [...] "its stories were surprisingly good considering how little was paid for them", and Wolf and Thompson agree, claiming that [...] "there was much that was memorable in Astonishing, both by way of immediate appeal and of more lasting quality". [...] Pohl himself, who later became a very successful magazine editor, felt he made many mistakes. [...] He quotes as an example his serialization of Malcolm Jameson's story [...] "Quicksands of Youthwardness" [...] in three parts; the story was only 27,000 words long, and readers complained (justifiably, in Pohl's view) that serializing it in a bimonthly magazine meant they had to wait for five months to read the whole story, in relatively small 9,000-word pieces. [...] Overall, Pohl assessed his performance by saying [...] "I wasn't really a very good editor"; adding [...] "With what I know now <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> those magazines sing, but as it was they just lay there".|$|E
2500|$|Even {{more popular}} was April Love (1957), {{a remake of}} Home in Indiana. Boone regards {{it as one of}} his favourites, [...] "the kind of movie I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> 20 more of: a musical, {{appealing}} characters, some drama, a good storyline, a happy ending, it's the kind of film which makes you feel good. I never wanted to make a depressing or immoral film." [...] In 1957 he was voted the third most popular star in the US.|$|E
2500|$|... {{played in}} my life. [...] "But {{on the other}} aspect – my {{position}} in the Australian side – it seems, [...] the players that the Australians picked for the establishment, I think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> it and probably could have finished up financially about the same – for playing less cricket. But I don't {{think it would have}} done my game any good because I know that playing World Series Cricket – it was tough – I think it made me a lot better cricketer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I {{love to hear}} you. You {{understand}} every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other. This charade!--If I {{had studied}} a twelvemonth, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>have</b> <b>made</b> any thing like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you hurt}} the lioness," [...] said Wulf, with a laugh. [...] "By St. Chad a good thrust!" [...] {{and he pointed}} to the long sword driven up to the hilt in the brute's breast. [...] "Why, <b>I</b> swear <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a better myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Snider lied!" [...] I cried. And then I seized her {{and held}} her in my arms, and made her listen to me, though she {{struggled}} and fought like a young lioness. [...] "I love you, Victory. You must know that I love you--that I have always loved you, and that <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> so base a promise." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I wanted Lizabeth Scott. I didn't {{want some}} blonde with big tits. You {{had to believe}} that this girl was real. Even if I took one of these over-sexed types who could not act, it would change how the Powell {{character}} is drawn into the affair. Remember the point of the script was that he's just a middle-level insurance investigator. He's tired of his job, spending time in his little office with a drab secretary. So <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a different picture, with a prettier girl than Lizabeth Scott, and told the story of that girl, her problems, but that wasn't this movie. That would make it phony, if you cast it with Marilyn Monroe, a type like that. I needed somebody real." ...|$|E
60|$|Had I only {{stopped at}} the proper time, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> {{anything}} out of it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{always comes}} on unlucky days!' she said. 'I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> it go off better. Thank {{you for taking}} all the trouble.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir; I know neither {{their names}} nor their condition, nor, <b>had</b> <b>I</b> wished it, <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> inquiries, for I know not whither they were taken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why didn't {{you tell}} me, so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> them <b>made?</b> It's impossible,--impossible that one brain should {{think of it}} all. Are you sure you've got enough hands in the kitchen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor thing!" [...] said Lady Jane. [...] "I {{always thought}} it was too much for her. <b>I</b> wish we <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> her more comfortable: it would have been such a thing for her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no; not for them,' rejoined Mrs Squeers; 'on {{purpose for}} you against you came home. Lor! you didn't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> such a mistake as that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> {{a better}} acknowledgment, sir, of your {{kindness}} to a poor forlorn {{girl who had}} no claim upon you, and of your protection of her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Case, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> oath {{it was you}} I saw {{on horseback}} this morning {{galloping}} on the London road," [...] said Mr. Warrington, who was supping with his relatives.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am commencing {{to believe}} that you are not so crazy as we have all thought," [...] he said. [...] "Certainly," [...] and he let his eyes rest upon Emma von der Tann, [...] "you are not mentally {{deficient}} in so far as your judgment of a good-looking woman is concerned. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a better selection myself.|$|R
60|$|In fact, I was {{surprised}} at the mildness of his statements. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>made</b> such statements if I had preferred to, because to exaggerate is the only way I can approximate to the truth. You cannot have a theory without principles. Principles is another name for prejudices. I have no prejudices in politics, religion, literature, or anything else.|$|R
2500|$|Mama Lucy {{had given}} Bobby Duran, {{representative}} from Taos, {{a job in}} her restaurant {{when he was at}} Highlands. He said, [...] "You gave me a job when I needed it the most. <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> it without you." [...] Lucy Lopez died on 31 May 1994 at the age of 80. The impact of the Mama Lucy Gang on state politics in the 1970s is still remembered.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot imagine," [...] she remarked, [...] "how <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> such {{a mistake}} about the door. I tried it twice {{or three times}} and it {{certainly}} {{seemed to me to}} be locked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello Haught," [...] was my greeting, as I {{dismounted}} {{and pulled}} out my watch. [...] "I'm four hours and a quarter late. Sorry. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> it, but didn't {{want to leave the}} wagons." ...|$|E
60|$|Asca. That were {{to invite}} {{me to my}} loss, sister; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a full meal in the world, {{and you would have}} me take up with hungry commons in the cloyster. Pray mend my fare, or I am gone.|$|E
5000|$|... "Winter {{was coming}} and I {{wanted to do the}} film," [...] said Corman. [...] "I was going to be {{shooting}} in New Mexico. I actualIy shot in December and to wait one more month would have put me in January and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the film. To wait till next summer would have dated the material I was dealing with, so I wanted to bring the film out early." ...|$|R
60|$|An overpowering languor {{and want}} of energy possessed me. Had I seen the dagger {{descending}} upon my breast <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>made</b> {{an effort to}} avert it. I suppose a bird when it is {{under the influence of}} a snake feels very much as I did in the presence of this gloomy-faced stranger. My mind was clear enough, but my body was as torpid as though I were still asleep.|$|R
60|$|And {{what was}} it that Kate did want? <b>I</b> believe nothing <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> her {{perfectly}} happy, or suited to her aunt; but that she would have been infinitely happier and better off had she had the spirit of obedience, of humility, or of unselfishness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} was a little brutal, and we shouldn't have stayed," [...] she said. [...] "Still, in a sense the {{attitude}} of the one they called the Kid was rather fine. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> quite a striking sketch of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|I don’t {{know what}} answer <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made.</b> I imagine Dominic thought himself unanswerable. As {{a matter of}} fact, before I could speak, a voice came to us down {{the face of the}} rock crying secretly, “Olà, down there! All is safe ashore.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh Tom, dear Tom, I {{know your}} secret heart. I {{have found it}} out; you couldn't hide the truth from me. Why didn't you tell me? I am sure <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> you happier, if you had! You love her, Tom, so dearly!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] {{said the}} magician, in a whisper; [...] "I {{told you that}} you should see what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do. <b>I</b> <b>HAVE</b> <b>MADE</b> YOU INVISIBLE; be quiet, and you shall see some more tricks that I shall play with these fellows." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{improved}} {{myself in}} this time in all the mechanic exercises which my necessities put me upon applying myself to; and <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> upon occasion, <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a very good carpenter, especially considering how few tools I had.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you have}} no idea how I was raised, Miss Harding," [...] he went on. [...] "Not that that's any excuse for the thing I did; but it does make it seem a wonder that <b>I</b> ever <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a start even at being decent. I never was well acquainted with any human being that wasn't a thief, or a pickpocket, or a murderer--and they were all beasts, each in his own {{particular}} way, only they weren't as decent as dumb beasts.|$|R
