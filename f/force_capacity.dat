40|$|Background/PurposeTo {{compare the}} neuromechanical {{characteristics}} and subjective outcomes for knees {{of patients with}} a cruciate ligament tear and reconstruction with those for knees of controls at three time intervals, and to determine correlations between the characteristics and subjective outcomes. MethodsTen participants with a cruciate ligament tear {{and at least a}} 12 -week conservative treatment prior to ligament reconstruction were prospectively measured prior to and 3 months and 6 months after surgery. Ten healthy individuals were recruited as controls. Questionnaire surveys regarding the injured knee were conducted, as were bilateral measurements of root mean square electromyography (EMG), the rate of EMG rise, the median frequency in the vastus medialis of the quadriceps muscles and antagonist coactivation from the semitendinosus muscle, and <b>force</b> <b>capacities,</b> including peak torque, rate of force development, and total works of the knee extension.

40|$|A single {{shortening}} contraction {{reduces the}} <b>force</b> <b>capacity</b> of muscle fibers, whereas <b>force</b> <b>capacity</b> is enhanced following lengthening. However, how motor unit recruitment and discharge rate (muscle activation) are adapted to such changes in <b>force</b> <b>capacity</b> during submaximal contractions remains unknown. Additionally, {{there is limited}} evidence for force enhancement in larger muscles. We therefore investigated lengthening- and shortening-induced changes in activation of the knee extensors. We hypothesized that when the same submaximal torque had to be generated following shortening, muscle activation had to be increased, whereas a lower activation would suffice to produce the same torque following lengthening. Muscle activation following shortening and lengthening (20 ° at 10 °/s) was determined using rectified surface electromyography (rsEMG) in a 1 st session (at 10 % and 50 % maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)) and additionally with EMG of 42 vastus lateralis motor units recorded in a 2 nd session (at 4 %- 47 %MVC). rsEMG and motor unit discharge rates following shortening and lengthening were normalized to isometric reference contractions. As expected, normalized rsEMG (1. 15 ± 0. 19) and discharge rate (1. 11 ± 0. 09) were higher following shortening (p 0. 05). Thus, muscle activation was increased to compensate for a reduced <b>force</b> <b>capacity</b> following shortening by increasing the discharge rate of the active motor units (rate coding). In contrast, following lengthening, rsEMG decreased while the discharge rates of active motor units remained similar, suggesting that derecruitment of units might have occurred. © 2008 NRC...|$|E

40|$|Geckos {{and other}} insects have fascinated {{scientists}} and casual observers with {{their ability to}} effortlessly climb up walls and across ceilings. This capability has inspired high capacity, easy release synthetic adhesives, which have focused on mimicking the fibrillar features found on the foot pads of these climbing organisms. However, without a fundamental framework that connects biological and synthetic adhesives from nanoscopic to macroscopic features, synthetic mimics have failed to perform favorably at large contact areas. In this thesis, we present a scaling approach which leads {{to an understanding of}} reversible adhesion in both synthetic and biological systems over multiple length scales. We identify, under various loading scenarios, how geometry and material properties control adhesion, and we apply this understanding to the development of high capacity, easy release synthetic adhesive materials at macroscopic size scales. Starting from basic fracture mechanics, our generalized scaling theory reveals that the ratio of contact area to compliance in the loading direction, A/C, is the governing scaling parameter for the <b>force</b> <b>capacity</b> of reversible adhesive interfaces. This scaling theory is verified experimentally in both synthetic and biological adhesive systems, over many orders of magnitude in size and adhesive <b>force</b> <b>capacity</b> (Chapter 2). This understanding is applied to the development of gecko-like adhesive pads, consisting of stiff, draping fabrics incorporated with thin elastomeric layers, which at macroscopic sizes (contact areas of 100 cm 2) exhibit force capacities on the order of 3000 N. Significantly, this adhesive pad is non-patterned and completely smooth, demonstrating that fibrillar features are not necessary to achieve high capacity, easy release adhesion at macroscopic sizes and emphasizing the importance of subsurface anatomy in biological adhesive systems (Chapter 2, Chapter 3). We further extend the utility of the scaling theory under shear (Chapter 4) and normal (Chapter 5) loading conditions and develop simple expressions for patterned and non-patterned interfaces which describe experimental <b>force</b> <b>capacity</b> data as a function of geometric parameters such as contact area, aspect ratio, and contact radius.

40|$|The {{study of}} soft {{material}} deformation and adhesion has broad applicability to industries ranging from automobile tires to medical prosthetics and implants. When a mechanical load is imposed on a soft material system, {{a variety of}} issues can arise, including non-linear deformations at interfaces between soft and rigid components. The work presented in this dissertation embraces the occurrence of these non-linear deformations, leading to the design of functional systems that incorporate a soft elastomer layer with application to bio-inspired adhesives and wrinkled surface fabrication. Understanding the deformation of a soft elastomer layer and how the system loading and geometry influence non-linear mechanical transitions, including interfacial failure and surface buckling, are crucial for predicting the performance of the mechanical system. This dissertation focuses on three soft composite systems of particular interest: (1) a multi-component, multiple adhesive contact surface device that allows for control of reversible adhesive force with geometric arrangement, (2) a confined isolated shear contact and an elastomeric coating, where the deformation and adhesion scale with the degree of confinement, and (3) a thin film lamination technique involving a soft substrate, where surface wrinkles are created and tuned in a continuous manner by controlling interfacial strains via applied contact load and substrate curvature. We first study the deformation and adhesion of a multi-component fabric-elastomer system with multiple adhesive contacts, or 2 ̆ 2 digits 2 ̆ 2. We conduct lap adhesion experiments in a model three digit system, finding that increasing angular spacing between adhesive digits increases system compliance and attenuates adhesive <b>force</b> <b>capacity.</b> To describe these findings we develop several relationships between system loading, materials properties, and geometry. We develop an equation which describes the relationship of system compliance with individual digit compliance and angular spacing between adhesive digits that agrees well with experimental data. Additionally, we derive equations for adhesive <b>force</b> <b>capacity</b> in a multiple adhesive contact system that agree well with experimental data. These explicit equations not only relate angular spacing with <b>force</b> <b>capacity,</b> but include critical strain energy release rate, digit compliance, and contact area. The equations derived and verified in this study will lead to more complex adhesive device design, as well as provide a foundation for studying the biomechanics of animals that use adhesion for locomotion. Next, we examine the deformation and adhesion of a rigid punch contacting and shearing a thin elastic coating. Using experiment we find that increasing confinement leads to a decrease in compliance and an increase in adhesive <b>force</b> <b>capacity.</b> We develop an explicit, semi-empirical equation with the help of finite element analysis to describe the influence of confinement ratio on shear compliance. This derived equation agrees with our experimental data, {{with the exception of a}} few data points that deviate due to a pronounced normal force component. Additionally, we derive an equation for adhesive <b>force</b> <b>capacity</b> as a function of confinement, elastic coating modulus, and critical strain energy release rate. We find experimentally that an increase in adhesive <b>force</b> <b>capacity</b> was largely dictated by an increase in confinement, with some additional contributions attributed to dissipative processes confined to the adhesive crack tip. These equations will serve as a guide for decoupling the contributions of geometry and materials parameters to adhesive force in systems involving a thin elastic layer. Lastly, we develop a fabrication technique that transforms the existing manufacturing process of film lamination to create tunable wrinkled surfaces in a thin film/soft elastomer composite. We conduct experiments to find that the process parameters of applied contact load and roller curvature can be used to control wrinkle aspect ratio. Our experimental results convey that increasing applied contact load and decreasing roller radius lead to an increase in wrinkle amplitude. Using both experimental results and finite element analysis, we develop a relation between wrinkle aspect ratio and the process parameters of applied contact load and roller curvature. This explicit equation allows us to predict the change in wrinkle amplitude for a given materials system as process parameters are tuned using our modified film lamination technique. Wrinkled surface technology has been envisioned in many applications ranging from optoelectronics to enhanced adhesives. The technique presented here to tune wrinkle size in a continuous process can lead to the large scale manufacturing of these previously proposed wrinkling technologies...|$|E

40|$|Green anoles {{are small}} lizards of the Southeastern United States. They possess an {{extensible}} throat-fan called a dewlap. Males have larger dewlaps and display them {{more often than}} females. Displays occur during courtship, during agonistic interaction, and during encounters with potential predators. The size of the dewlap of male green anoles is positively correlated with maximum bite <b>force</b> <b>capacity.</b> Bite <b>force</b> <b>capacity,</b> in turn, is predictive of the winner during agonistic interactions. The correlation between these traits suggests that dewlap size {{may be used as}} a reliable signal of maximum bite <b>force</b> <b>capacity.</b> In this dissertation, I address three components of this system. First, I manipulate dewlap size and stage interactions between male green anoles. By removing the correlation between dewlap size and bite force, I was able to show that during staged encounters, bite force is predictive of the winner, but dewlap size is not. In the second chapter, I test for potential costs due to an increased predation risk as a result of dewlap displays. I observed no difference in recapture rates between animals that were experimentally prevented from extending their dewlaps and control counterparts. However, other data suggest that the presence of a pink dewlap may increase risk of predation. These results suggest that though there may be a predation-based cost to dewlap displays, green anoles use behavioral means to ameliorate this risk. Finally, I use a castration and hormone-replacement experiment to test whether testosterone mediates seasonal changes in dewlap size and bite force. I hypothesized that testosterone would mediate changes in both traits {{in order to maintain the}} correlation between them. However, I found no effect of testosterone on change in dewlap size or bite force performance. Another trait, sprint speed performance, was affected by hormone treatment in the breeding season such that animals with high levels of testosterone ran faster than animals from the other treatment groups. My results corroborate other research showing that hormones regulate plasticity in some systems, while other systems are insensitive. However, the mechanisms that regulate changes in the two components of the reliable signaling system in green anoles remain unknown. ...|$|E
40|$|Steel liner plates, {{which are}} bolted {{together}} to form a shell, are commonly used to provide temporary protective linings in the tunneling industry to ensure the stability of the tunnel and safety of the workers until more permanent ground reinforcement can be installed. As the ground deforms to try and close the opening, the liner plate is radially stressed, and by deforming redistributes these loads back to the surrounding insitu earth. Grouting behind the plates is done to fill any voids and ensure uniform contact to the strata {{around the back of the}} plates. Another function of the liner plate in some applications is to act as a platform or structure for the mining machine to react against in order to develop the necessary forward thrust to be able to excavate the face. In this case, the liner plates are loaded axially as a horizontal column of bolted liner plate rings, creating a jacking force against the liner plate assembly. In general, the buckling strength of the plate sections determines the jacking <b>force</b> <b>capacity.</b> Historically, the jacking <b>force</b> <b>capacity</b> of tunnel liner plates has been theoretically determined by some simplistic equations developed from tests of single liner plates. Recently, full-scale tests on a complete circular section of bolted liner plate ring segments have been conducted in the NIOSH Safety Structures Testing Laboratory using the unique Mine Roof Simulator to apply controlled loading in a manner that simulates the real world environment. Due to the unique size and capacity of the Mine Roof Simulator, these are believed to be the first full-scale tests conducted on the jacking force capability of tunnel liner plate rings. These tests indicate that the previously used theoretical equations tend to over predict the jacking <b>force</b> <b>capacity</b> of these tunnel liner plates. Unanticipated deformations in the field have been observed at loads below these theoretical design loads, therefore, a more accurate determination of the jacking force capability was needed.
