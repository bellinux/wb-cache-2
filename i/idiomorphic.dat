Some syenogranite contain rare <b>idiomorphic</b> amphibole (Fe-hornblende and Fe-edenite), biotite (annite 25%-35%), plagioclase (An3), along with K-feldspar and quartz. (Mafti, 2001).|$|E
50|$|Investigation of {{deposits}} of green vanadium-bearing kornerupine, revealed {{the presence of}} a new vanadium mineral through observations in reflected light. Schreyerite was first discovered in the Kwale district, Kenya. Polymorphous with kyzylkumite, it occurs in highly twinned unmixed grains in vanadium-bearing rutile that occurs as <b>idiomorphic</b> crystals in kornerupine-bearing quartz-biotite-sillimanite gneiss. It also occurs in a pyrite deposit at Sartra, Sweden, in a Pb-Zn ore deposit at Rampura Agucha, India, and recently in metamorphic rocks of the Ol’khon complex on the western shore of Lake Baikal, Russia. Instead of the usual intergrowths with rutile, single crystals of schreyerite were found, associated with titanite.|$|E
50|$|There is {{typically}} {{no distinction between}} a first generation of large well-shaped crystals and a fine-grained ground-mass. The minerals of each have formed in a definite order, and each has had a period of crystallization that may be very distinct or may have coincided with or overlapped the period of formation {{of some of the}} other ingredients. Earlier crystals originated {{at a time when most}} of the rock was still liquid and are more or less perfect. Later crystals are less regular in shape because they were compelled to occupy the spaces left between the already-formed crystals. The former case is said to be <b>idiomorphic</b> (or automorphic); the latter is xenomorphic. There are also many other characteristics that serve to distinguish the members of these two groups. For example, orthoclase {{is typically}} feldspar from granite, while its modifications occur in lavas of similar composition. The same distinction holds for nepheline varieties. Leucite is common in lavas but very rare in plutonic rocks. Muscovite is confined to intrusions. These differences show the influence of the physical conditions under which consolidation takes place.|$|E
50|$|Those leucite rocks {{which contain}} {{abundant}} essential plagioclase feldspar {{are known as}} leucite tephrites and leucite basanites. The former consist mainly of plagioclase, leucite and augite, while the latter contain olivine in addition. The leucite is often present in two sets of crystals, both porphyritic and as an ingredient of the ground mass. It is always <b>idiomorphic</b> with rounded outlines. The feldspar ranges from bytownite to oligoclase, being usually a variety of labradorite; orthoclase is scarce. The augite varies a good deal in chemnistry and optical character, being green, brown or violet (suggesting high Na and Ti content), but it is rarely high enough in Na and Fe to qualify as aegirine-augite or aegirine. Among the accessory minerals biotite, brown hornblende, hauyne, iron oxides and apatite are the commonest; melanite and nepheline may also occur. The ground mass of these rocks is only occasionally rich in glass. The leucite-tephrites and leucite-basanites of Vesuvius and Somma are familiar examples of this class of rocks. They are black or ashy-grey in color, often vesicular, and may contain many large grey phenocysts of leucite. Their black augite and yellow green olivine are also easily observed in hand specimens. From Volcan Ello, Sardinia and Roccamonfina similar rocks are obtained; they occur also in Bohemia, in Java, Celebes, Kilimanjaro (Africa) and near Trebizond in Asia Minor.|$|E
50|$|The scapolite limestones {{and contact}} {{metamorphic}} rocks. As silicates rich in calcium, {{it is to}} be expected that these minerals will be found where impure limestones have been crystallized by contact with an igneous magma. Even marialite (the variety richest in soda) occurs in this association, being principally obtained in small crystals lining cavities in ejected blocks of crystalline limestone at Vesuvius and the craters of the Eifel in Germany. Scapolite and wernerite are far more common at the contacts of limestone with intrusive masses. The minerals that accompany them are calcite, epidote, vesuvianite, garnet, wollastonite, diopside and amphibole. The scapolites are colorless, flesh-colored, grey or greenish; occasionally they are nearly black from the presence of very small enclosures of graphitic material. They are not in very perfect crystals, though sometimes incomplete octagonal sections are visible; the tetragonal cleavage, strong double refraction and uniaxial interference figure distinguish them readily from other minerals. Commonly they weather to micaceous aggregate, but sometimes an isotropic substance of unknown nature is seen replacing them. In crystalline limestones and calc-silicate rocks they occur in small and usually inconspicuous grains mingled with the other components of the rock. Large, nearly <b>idiomorphic</b> crystals are sometimes found in argillaceous rocks (altered calcareous shales) that have suffered thermal metamorphism. In the Pyrenees there are extensive outcrops of limestone penetrated by igneous rocks described as ophites (varieties of diabase) and lherzolites (peridotites). At the contacts scapolite occurs in a great number of places, both in the limestones and in the calcareous shales that accompany them. In some of these rocks large crystals of one of the scapolite minerals (an inch or two in length) occur, usually as octagonal prisms with imperfect terminations. In others the mineral is found in small irregular grains. It is sometimes clear, but often crowded with minute enclosures of augite, tourmaline, biotite and other minerals, such as constitute the surrounding matrix. From these districts also a black variety is well known, filled with minute graphitic enclosures, often exceedingly small and rendering the mineral nearly opaque. The names couzeranite and dipyre are often given to this kind of scapolite. Apparently the presence of chlorine in small quantities, which may often be detected in limestones, to some extent determines the formation of the mineral.|$|E

40|$|The Merensky Reef of the Bushveld Complex {{consists}} of two chromitite layers separated by coarse-grained melanorite. Microstructural analysis of the chromitite layers using electron backscatter diffraction analysis (EBSD), high-resolution X-ray microtomography and crystal size distribution analyses distinguished two populations of chromite crystals: fine-grained <b>idiomorphic</b> and large silicate inclusion-bearing crystals. The lower chromitite layer contains both populations, whereas the upper contains only fine <b>idiomorphic</b> grains. Most of the inclusion-bearing chromites have characteristic amoeboidal shapes that have been previously explained as products of sintering of pre-existing smaller <b>idiomorphic</b> crystals. Two possible mechanisms have been proposed for sintering of chromite crystals: (1) amalgamation of a cluster of grains with the same original crystallographic orientation; and (2) sintering of randomly orientated crystals followed by annealing into a single grain. The EBSD data show no evidence for clusters of similarly oriented grains among the <b>idiomorphic</b> population, nor for earlier presence of <b>idiomorphic</b> subgrains spatially related to inclusions, and therefore are evidence against both of the proposed sintering mechanisms. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis maps show deformation-related misorientations and curved subgrain boundaries within the large, amoeboidal crystals, and absence of such features in the fine-grained population. Microstructures observed in the lower chromitite layer are interpreted {{as the result of}} deformation during compaction of the orthocumulate layers, and constitute evidence for the formation of the amoeboid morphologies at an early stage of consolidation. An alternative model is proposed whereby silicate inclusions are incorporated during maturation and recrystallisation of initially dendritic chromite crystals formed as a result of supercooling during emplacement of the lower chromite layer against cooler anorthosite during the magma influx that formed the Merensky Reef. The upper chromite layer formed from a subsequent magma influx, and hence lacked a mechanism to form dendritic chromite. This accounts for {{the difference between the two}} layers...|$|E

At temperatures above the eutectoid temperature where allotriomorphic ferrite is the only austenite transformation product, the soft-impingement effect should be taken into account in the modelling. By contrast, at temperatures below the eutectoid temperature, the formation of pearlite avoids the carbon enrichment of austenite due to the previous ferrite formation, and therefore carbon concentration in austenite far from the α/γ interface remains the same as the overall carbon content of the steel. Hence, the soft-impingement effect should be neglected, and allotriomorphic and <b>idiomorphic</b> ferrite is considered to grow under a parabolic law.

40|$|SUMMARY It is not {{possible}} to understand the etiology of hypertension without considering the role of in-heritance. Epidemiological evidence indicates that the development of high blood pressure in the population at large depends on the interaction of different types of genes and several environmental influences. The sources of genetic variation in blood pressure distribution are polygenes, polymorphic genes, and dominant <b>idiomorphic</b> genes. The main environmental sources are weight gain, excess salt (Na) intake, and psychosocial stress. Only those individuals with a specific genetic predisposition may develop high blood pressure when exposed to ex-cessive environmental influences.

40|$|The {{study of}} mafic and aluminous granulites from the Monte Castelo Gabbro (Órdenes Complex, NW Spain) reveals an {{anticlockwise}} P–T path that we interpret {{as related to}} the tectonothermal activity in a magmatic arc, probably an island arc. The P–T path was obtained after a detailed study of the textural relationships and mineral assemblage succession in the aluminous granulites, and comparing these with an appropriate petrogenetic grid. Additional thermobarometry was also performed. The granulites are highly heterogeneous, with distinct compositional domains that may alternate even at thin-section scale. Garnets are generally <b>idiomorphic</b> to subidiomorphic, and in certain domains of the aluminous granulites they show overgrowths forming xenomorphic coronas around {{a more or less}} <b>idiomorphic</b> core. Both types of garnets show significant Ca enrichment at the crystal rims, which, together with the other mineralogical and textural characteristics, is compatible with a pressure increase with low T variation. P–T estimations indicate a peak of T > 800 °C and P ∼ 9 · 5 kbar, attained after a significant increase in pressure that took place at high temperatures (in the sillimanite field).

Gene replacement events involved the homologous sequences flanking the unique mating type <b>idiomorphic</b> DNA, resulting in apparently isogenic a and A strains.

In-clusions of small rhombs and granules of calcite are commonly observed in the albite crystals.

The textural relationｓ between those interstitial hydrous minerals and major constituent minerals, such as olivines and clinopyroxenes suggest the crystallization of the former from the intergranular residual liquids. The modal amounts of phlogopites in wehrlite are less than 1 %, and that of pargasites range from 2 to 5 %. Microprobe analyses have been carried for those hydrous minerals and the major constituent minerals. namely, olivine, clinopyroxene and <b>idiomorphic</b> zoned chromite. Olivines in wehrlite {{from the northern}} Kanto mountains have rather iron-rich nature and range from Foso to Fo(80) and those coexisting with the hydrous minerals are Fo(82. 5) in average. Clinopyroxenes from mica bearing wehrlite contain about 2. 5 % Al(2) O(3). 17 % MgO and 5. 5 % FeO. Tentative cation per cent of Ca, Mg and Fe are calculated as Ca(42. 6) Mg(48. 1) Fe(9. 3) in average. The present probe analyses show high magnesian nature of the interstitial phlogopites. In addition, these phlogopites are conspicuous by their high TiO(2) content ranging from 4. 6 to 5. 2 %. Mg/Mg + Fe versus Ti relation plotted in Fig. 4 revealed that the present phlogopite are {{similar to that of}} the alkaline pyroxenite nodules from the Lashaine volcano, northern Tanzania. Pargasites in mica bearing wehrlite are also rich in TiO(2) (3. 0 ～ 4. 7 %), whereas pargasitic common hornblende from hornblendite or gabbro are rather low in TiO(2) (0. 9 ～ 1. 7 %). Mg/Mg+Fe+Mn versus Ti relations of amphiboles illustrate that Ti contents increase with decrease of Mg/Mg+Fe +Mn. Two different increasing trend for Ti conten t are also noticed. <b>Idiomorphic</b> chromites show distinct compositional variation from core to rim. Total FeO increases about 16 % at rim, whereas TiO(2), Al(2) O(3) and MgO decrease at the rim. Possible crystallization scheme of those hydrous minersls is proposed in Fig. 10, where the maximum stability limits of phlogopite and hornblende are shown with the curve for begining of melting of basalt. Separation of liquid fraction from cumulate phase with a small trapped intergranular liquid might occur at point A. The liquid fraction then might move upward through the course II. In cumulate phase, intergranular liquid might crystallize pargasitic amphibole by the reaction with olivine and clinopyroxene through the course I in Fig. 10. Intergranular liquid might decrease with production of amphiboles and K(2) O might concentrate in residual liquid. At final stage of crystallization, residual liquid rich in K(2) O might crystallize as phlogopite by the reactions with olivine.

Mineralogical and compositional data suggests that pyrite {{is the result of the}} activity of late magmatic/hydrothermal fluids that triggered the partial replacement of pyrrhotite and plagioclase by pyrite, probably due to an increase in the sulphur fugacity during cooling. During this episode, pyrites inherited the IPGE content of mineral to that was replaced, whereas other elements such as Pd, Au and semi-metals were likely partially introduced into pyrite via altering fluids. These results highlight that pyrite can host appreciable amounts of PGE and therefore it should not be overlooked as a potential carrier of these metals in Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulphide deposits...|$|E
40|$|At DSDP Site 477, late Quaternary diatomaceous muds and delta-derived silty-sand turbidites at 2000 meters {{water depth}} have been {{extensively}} and progressively altered by a deep-seated heat source beneath a sill. Bulk petrologic and microprobe analyses {{have identified a}} crudely zoned paragenesis within 260 meters sub-bottom which ranges from unaltered to slightly altered oozes (0 - 50 m), anhydrite-dolomite claystones (105 - 125 m), illite-chlorite-pyrite claystones (125 - 140 m), chlorite-pyrite-calcite-carbonaceous claystones with traces of K-feldspar, albite, epidote (140 - 190 m), and chlorite-epidote-quartz-albite-pyrrhotite-sphene sandstone (190 - 260 m). Several petrologic features suggest rapid processes of ocean floor metamorphism: (1) friable and porous textures, (2) abundant relict grains with overgrowths, (3) <b>idiomorphic</b> habits on epidotes, feldspars, and quartz, and (4) a steep gradient in levels of alteration. Many aspects of this hydrothermal assemblage are similar to hydrothermally metamorphosed sandstones of the Cerro Prieto, Mexico, geothermal area...|$|E
40|$|DATOLITE Occurs in {{abundance}} at Meldon within the contact metamor-phic aureole on the north-west {{margin of the}} Dartmoor granite. The geological setting has been described recently (Dearman, 1959; 1963) {{so that it will}} suffice to say that a group of calcareous sediments, including both cherts and limestones, crop out three times at increasing distances from the granite margin within a narrow Jnlier of the Lower Culm Measures (Lower Carboniferous). The presence of datolite is associated with evidence for metasomatic activity involving at least tin, iron, and boron; datolite replaces woilas-tonite in malayaite wollastonite hornfels from the dumps of Red-a-yen mine (Sharkawi and Dearman, 1966). From the same locality, non-reactive dilatation veins in calc-ffintas contain <b>idiomorphic</b> stanniferous grossular, datolite, and heulandite. Datolite may be associated with axinite as, for example, in the Meldon aplite quarry where reaction along joints cutting aplite veins in calc-fiinta has produced coarsely crystallin...|$|E
40|$|Larger benthic foraminiferal tests {{from the}} Maastrichtian and Eocene of western Turkey contain a large variety of borings. Two ichnospecies are defined. Maeandropolydora osmaneliensis isp. nov. in tests of Orbitoides is {{distinguished}} by a tube, winding sinuously in an irregular manner. This boring {{was formed by}} a foraging parasite or scavenger, where the tracemaker specifically exploited certain parts of its substrate. Trypanites helicus isp. nov. in tests of Nummulites is characterized by its tube coiled into a spiral. The boring is interpreted as a dwelling trace. As the boring may be considered to have both <b>idiomorphic</b> and stenomorphic features, it represents an ethological and taxonomic dilemma. To avoid inherent subjectivity within taxonomic classifications, we suggest the exclusion of ethological interpretations from diagnoses. The occurrence of borings may affect the preservational potential of the foraminiferal tests, and thus {{on the outcome of}} palaeoenvironmental analyses. </p...|$|E
