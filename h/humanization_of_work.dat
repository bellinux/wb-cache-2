The empirical analysis spans the manufacturing sectors of eleven of the leading industrialised nations over the period 1960 - 95. This substantive core of the thesis is informed by an examination of research method {{in the field of}} employment relations. Initial assessment of the availability and construct validity to aggregate statistical indicators of the <b>humanization</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> results in consideration of three phenomena; the rate of incidence of fatal injuries, average annual hours actually worked, and the relative extent of managerial hierarchy. Detailed assessment of the conceptual basis of the available statistics then follows, with the aim of obtaining historically consistent and cross-nationally comparable data on these aspects of work humanization. Although dependable data on fatalities and hours are derived, the limits of the aggregate indicator of managerial hierarchy are ultimately stressed. The comparative historical patterns in the data are then examined for evidence of cross-national convergence in experiences of work humanization. With little indication of any historic convergence apparent the analysis turns to consider the forces which may shape distinctive societal experiences. Quantitative gauges of the shape of the broad political economy are assembled, with a particular attention focused on the quantitative characterisation of the power resources of employees, whether collective or individual. The meaning of these necessarily crude indicators is given extensive consideration. The thesis culminates in separate panel econometric investigations of the political economic characteristics associated with comparative fatal injury incidence and actual annual hours of work. Substantial evidence is presented that the <b>humanization</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is associated with an attenuation of the vulnerability of employees to managerial prerogative...|$|E

The problems of humanization are combined with definition of such phenomena or tendencies in the organizational system of an industrial plant as the process of work,. elements of the situation of work and the attitudes of workers. A plausible scale is proposed for measuring levels of humanization of particular elements in the situation of work. In general, the practice of humanization in industrial plants is largely determined by the technological aspects of production (including factors directly relating to hygene {{and the safety of}} work).

40|$|One of {{the widely}} held {{opinions}} about Japanese firms’ high performance suggests that Japanese employees, organized in teams, are making kaizen (continuous improvements) {{in their own}} jobs through quality circles or other initiatives such as a suggestion system. But who are these employees? They {{would have to be}} blue−collar workers in the Western perception, but the part of their contribution in improving productivity and price cost does not seem exceed 10 % of all improvements obtained. Who then brings about the major part of these improvements? Are the kaizen activities carried out without having relation to the company’s profit strategy? If the employees have an objective in their kaizen activities, who provides the objectives? What do these objectives consist of? How are their activities managed? These questions invite us to inquire about a whole management system of kaizen at Toyota Production System, considered as the basic model of “Lean Production”. But Toyota reoriented its organized kaizen activities toward the construction of more humanized production system during 1990 s. This paper then shows this reorientation and the new direction by showing the case of Tahara No. 1 plant.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of 1990 s, Toyota has been pursuing a new direction in its human resource management and assembly work. After encountering a labor crisis-labor shortage and high turn over of young workers-during the economic boom provoked by the "financial bubble" {{toward the end of}} 1980 s, Toyota's management and Union discussed ways of making the work more attractive. Based on this discussion, the production engineering division developed a new assembly line concept realized firstly at Toyota Kyushu plant (1992), applied also to Toyota's Motomachi No. 2 plant (1994), Tahara No. 1 plant (1995) and Motomachi No. 1 plant (1996). Among these plants, the construction of the assembly line at Tahara No. 1 Plant constitutes a unique case in {{the fact that it was}} not the production engineering division, but the foremen, supervisors and engineers belonging to the plant who conceived and constructed this new assembly line. Moreover, in order to realize what they considered as their ideal assembly line, they proposed to the product development center an important change of car structure and parts design from the very beginning of product development where the so called "concurrent engineering" has started. The second part of this paper deals with the 'Kaizen' activities in order to realize their "ideal assembly line" after construction. In the concluding section, I emphasize the fact that the 'Kaizen' activities at Toyota are now centered on <b>humanization</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> certainly without renouncing efforts towards cost reduction...|$|E

Since the decade of 1980 the development of approaches for the <b>humanization</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> organization, and for the development of participative organizational options induced to new proposals related to the development of complex and integrated automated systems. From such parallel conceptual development emerged the concept of “anthropocentric robotic systems” and quickly it covered also other fields of automation. More recently, the debate also covers issues related to working perception of people dealing with autonomous systems (e. g. Autonomous robotics) in tasks related to production planning, to programming and to process control. In fact, today one can understand the wider use of the anthropocentrism concept of production architectures, when understanding the new quality of these systems. In this chapter the author analyses the evolution of these issues related to governance of ICT applied to manufacturing and industrial services in research programmes strengthening very much the ‘classical’ concept of anthropocentric-based systems. It is emerging a new value of the intuitive capacities and human knowledge in the optimization and flexibilization of the manufacturing processes.

Da Fertigungsarbeit eine qualitativ immer wichtiger werdende Komponente von modernen Produktionssystemen darstellt, muß eine vorausschauende Personalpolitik integraler Bestandteil der Planung und Einführung von CIM-Systemen sein. Die vorhandenen Gestaltungsalternativen bei rechnerintegrierter Fertigung lassen sich zwischen den Polen einer weitgehen den Arbeitszerlegung einerseits und der umfassenden Reintegration von Arbeitsaufgaben andererseits abbilden. Strukturen qualifiziert-kooperativer Fertigungsarbeit sind unter betriebswirtschaftlichen Effizienzüberlegungen ebenso wie in arbeitspolitischer Perspektive anderen Alternativen überlegen.

Approved by the ethics committee at No. 830. 275. More than half of the interviewed mothers were older than 20 years, ie, the number of teens who gave birth vaginally was 60 (30. 0 %), where the majority (64. 0 %) were in married and / or stable. This study revealed some weaknesses regarding the outcome studied, noting that the Humanized Birth was below 50 %. It was observed in the bivariate analysis compared to humanized birth an association with education when less than or equal to 7 years and identified that mothers with low education levels, have a predisposing factor for non-adherence to good practice delivery. In gestational history (multigesta category), obtained a considered relationship with the humanized delivery, noting that when the mother had a previous pregnancy history, are more likely to adopt the beneficial practices that favor to labor and delivery. Having "done forceps" was associated with the humanized delivery, and in an attempt to justify this association, we try to understand the real reason was the size acquired in our sample or unfavorable conditions of mothers.
