25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E
500|$|The non-destruction of one's coat, he says, is not fated simply, but co-fated {{with its}} {{being taken care}} of, and someone's being saved from his enemies is co-fated with his fleeing those enemies; and having {{children}} is co-fated with being willing to lie with a woman. ... For many things cannot occur without our being willing and indeed contributing a most strenuous eagerness and zeal for these things, since, <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fated for these things to occur in conjunction with this personal effort. ... But {{it will be in}} our power, he says, with what is in our power being included in fate.|$|E
500|$|Herc {{carefully}} {{studied the}} dancers. [...] "I was smoking cigarettes and I {{was waiting for}} the records to finish. And I noticed people was waiting for certain parts of the record," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> an insight as profound as Ruddy Redwood's dub discovery. The moment when the dancers really got wild was in a song's short instrumental break, when the band would drop out and the rhythm section would get elemental. Forget melody, chorus, songs—it was all about the groove, building it, keeping it going. Like a string theorist, Herc zeroed in on the fundamental vibrating loop {{at the heart of the}} record, the break.|$|E

500|$|Radcliffe first {{expressed}} a desire to act at the age of five, and in December 1999, aged 10, he made his acting debut in BBC One's televised two-part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield, portraying the title character as a young boy. He was educated at three independent schools for boys: Redcliffe School, a day school in Chelsea's Redcliffe Square, Sussex House School, a day school in Chelsea's Cadogan Square, and the City of London School, a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London's financial district (known as the City of London). Attending school became difficult for Radcliffe after the release of the first Harry Potter film, with some fellow pupils becoming hostile, though <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> people just trying to [...] "have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter" [...] rather than jealousy.|$|E
500|$|Calvert {{stated that}} Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit has an [...] "iconic place in history" [...] {{as it had}} [...] "generation-defining resonance" [...] for young people from its era"; he states that [...] "no other band...made the urge to self-destruct...as listenable", with [...] "authentic" [...] pain and [...] "disaffection. Calvert also calls the record [...] "chart history's most ferocious, dark and intense" [...] music since early punk rock, and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "heavy when heavy was needed" [...] by young people of that era, [...] "jarr young America awake" [...] and giving them {{something}} to [...] "cling to" [...] in difficult times. A 2017 book stated that grunge [...] "..forever changed the identity of rock music in a way analogous to punk"; moreover, grunge added [...] "introspective" [...] lyrics about [...] "existential authenticity" [...] and [...] "what {{it means to be}} true to oneself". Grunge's Kurt Cobain has been called the [...] "voice of Generation X", playing the same role for this demographic as Bob Dylan played for 1960s youth and that John Lennon played for the 1970s generation. Bob Batchelor states that Nirvana was [...] "as important as Elvis or the Beatles.” ...|$|E
2500|$|While under Ayyubid rule in 1226, Arab {{geographer}} Yaqut al-Hamawi mentions it as Majdal Yafa or [...] "Tower of Jaffa", {{probably due}} to its proximity {{to the city of}} Jaffa. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a village with a [...] "formidable fort".|$|E

6000|$|... "But I can't," [...] protested Peter. [...] "Everybody else {{seems to}} hurry, at times anyway, but Jimmy never does. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{a waste of}} energy, {{whatever}} that means." ...|$|R

2500|$|Begg {{notes that}} he visited a second Afghan {{training}} camp, near Jalalabad, {{for two or three}} days during that time. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> run by Iraqi Kurds, not by al-Qaeda. They were training to use improvised incendiary grenades to fight Saddam Hussein. He donated a few hundred British pounds to that camp and a third training camp. [...] A Pentagon spokesman said Begg spent five days in early 1998 at Derunta, an al-Qaeda-affiliated Afghan training camp. Defense Department officials said that Begg's sworn statements state he trained at Derunta and two other Afghan camps. He denied saying that, but acknowledged signing some documents while in custody because he feared for his life.|$|E
2500|$|Tomkinson {{thinks the}} impure motives behind {{the idea of}} God being pure spirit are only too obvious. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} a pagan form of self-flattery to imagine {{there was a little}} bit of God in us all. He traces its history from Nimrod, through Pythagoras to Pliny the Elder and tells how they loved to commission statues of themselves to impress others. Scriptural literalists (from Augustine to Richard Baxter) fall into a similar error of human imaginings. Yet there was always an underground stream of the truth. He cites the followers of Sabilis which we would probably label Sabellianism. Also the Athrapamorphets. These truth-sayers were persecuted by the dominant culture due to the take-over of the church by the state and because the Apostles [...] "preached the faith in a personal God, but in that they clothed it within the appellation of several titles, it appeared more intricate and mysterious" [...] than it really was.|$|E
6000|$|... "He thinks Porter, Morr, Lawrence, and Plum {{ought to}} be put back on the eleven. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a shame that they were put off in the first place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pleasant weather we <b>are</b> having," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> never other, so I notice, with him. Perhaps {{the order}} of a suit itself is a little beam of sunshine.|$|R
50|$|Lastly, with {{reference}} to events that had only recently preceded his book, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not enough to believe the doctrines, we {{have to believe in}} the prophets' commission, too.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There; <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not his fault, my dear,' remarked {{the wicked}} Miss Price. 'Perhaps {{you were too}} jealous, or too hasty with him? <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not his fault. You hear; I think that's apology enough.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{does not}} know how many years ago,' said Dirkovitch facing the mess, 'but <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very long ago in the war. I think that there was an accident. He says he was of this glorious and {{distinguished}} regiment in the war.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lady Rotherwood can't bear his going,' said Mysie, 'and Mr. White and Mr. Stebbing {{say that}} he need not; but he is quite determined, though he has got his arm in a sling, for <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all his fault for going where he ought not. And he won't have the carriage, for he says it would shake his bones ever {{so much more than}} Shank's mare.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Ethel; [...] "if papa will but let you try for the Randall {{scholarship}} next year, but <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{not good}} to go to Oxford so young." ...|$|R
50|$|Kailash gives Mr. Shukla and Chandar {{a cup of}} tea {{and says}} they will get {{peaceful}} in a few minutes. Mr. Shukla <b>says</b> <b>he</b> has saved him today and asks what his name <b>is.</b> <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> Kailash. Mr. Shukla asks what his cast <b>is.</b> <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> Brahman. Mr. Shukla asks who is at home. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> his father and mother. Mr. Shukla introduces him to Chandar who is doing PhD and is like his family member. Mr. Shukla <b>says</b> that <b>he</b> wants to meet his parents, Kailash <b>says</b> sure, <b>he</b> has no objection.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I will not. I have no judgment. He must {{judge for}} me in everything. If <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> better that we should part, then--then-- then I will let him go." ...|$|R
6000|$|Attempts {{have been}} made too (for there is {{considerable}} ingenuity and unlimited money on the other side) to pretend {{that it is a}} question of Protestant missions against Catholic. Any one who thinks this should read the book, [...] "La Question Kongolaise," [...] of the eloquent and holy Jesuit, Father Vermeersch. He lived in the country and, as <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the sight of the [...] "immeasurable misery," [...] which drove him to write.|$|E
60|$|Mercier, in his loose way, {{estimates}} the Procession and assistants at two hundred thousand. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one boundless inarticulate Haha;--transcendent World-Laughter; {{comparable to the}} Saturnalia of the Ancients. Why not? Here too, as we said, is Human Nature once more human; shudder at it whoso is of shuddering humour: yet behold it is human. It has 'swallowed all formulas;' it tripudiates even so. For which reason they that collect Vases and Antiques, with figures of Dancing Bacchantes 'in wild and all but impossible positions,' may look with some interest on it.|$|E
6000|$|... "The rest is all talk--very good talk; but I {{doubt whether}} it would {{interest}} you. He goes on to talk of a great many things---of the way Bellini spoke French, for example. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> bloodcurdling, horrible, cataclysmal. He brought out the poor French words and broke them upon the wheel, till you thought the whole world must give way with a thunder-crash. A dead hush reigned in the room; the women {{did not know whether}} to faint or fly; the men looked down at their pantaloons, and tried to realise what they had on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{doctor is}} still with him,' said Mr. Macrae; 'a case of {{concussion}} of the brain, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> But {{you go out and}} take the air, you must be careful of yourself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> by {{no means}} an {{uncommon}} case, {{and that he has}} effected a complete cure, and they will be as happy as idiots,' said Mrs. Nicholson, as she rose to depart.|$|R
50|$|Bret asks Jemaine {{to be his}} wingman {{and they}} borrow a headset from Dave's store so that Jemaine and Dave can feed him advice from a distance. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an idea <b>he</b> got from a sitcom.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not speak}} so harshly of poor King Pluto," [...] said Proserpina, kissing her mother. [...] "He {{has some very}} good qualities; and I really think I can bear to spend six months in his palace, if he will only let me spend the other six with you. He {{certainly}} did very wrong to carry me off; but then, as <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> but a dismal sort of life for him, to live in that great gloomy place, all alone; and it has made a wonderful change in his spirits {{to have a little}} girl to run up stairs and down. There is some comfort in making him so happy; and so, upon the whole, dearest mother, let us be thankful that he is not to keep me the whole year round." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your supposition, Dr. Ashleigh, {{is nearly}} {{that of the}} detective who has been sent down here, and who, knowing nothing of my private affairs, could not without a clue come to any other conclusion. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a strange and unusual, {{although}} not an unprecedented affair. This clue I have not yet given him, although I intend to do so upon leaving this room, as I have not the least doubt {{in my own mind}} that my suspicions are correct. My sister, Dr. Ashleigh, was not tortured to tell where any plate was hidden: she was treated as she was to make her divulge the supposed hiding-place of what--in spite of all we can say--it still appears that some of you persist in believing to be in existence,--I mean my late brother's will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Ruth, {{surely this}} man is not worthy of you. He bears, I hear, on all sides a very bad character, and I think you {{will be more than}} risking your {{happiness}} with such a man; I think for your own sake {{it would be better to}} give him up. My brother is very incensed against him; he has been out with the other keepers to the place where this fray occurred and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a most cowardly business, for the poachers were eight to three, and he seems to have no doubt whatever that Forester was one of the party, and that they will be able to prove it. I do think, Ruth, you ought to give him up altogether. I am not talking to you as a mistress, you know, but as a friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{certainly}} has not much respect for it. He {{seems to go}} out of his way almost to openly insult it. He calls half-past two thirty-eight o'clock, and in twenty minutes from then <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> one! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have had}} a nice note from Charley just now. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{expected}} at school that when Walter puts on his jacket, all the Miss Kings will {{fall in love with}} him to desperation and faint away.|$|R
60|$|COLFORD. It {{makes no}} odds, General. Four {{of us in}} there heard him. <b>He's</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Ronald Dancy robbed him down at WINSOR's. The fellow's mad over losing the price of that filly now she's won the Cambridgeshire.|$|R
