Their motto was the Latin phrase [...] "Non Gratus Rodentum"—"not worth a rat". Since the 1940s, during the war against the French colonial forces, the Viet Cong had created an extensive underground system of complexes. By the 1960s, there were underground hospitals, training <b>grounds,</b> <b>storage</b> facilities, headquarters and more. The Viet Cong, who were skilled at guerrilla warfare, might stay underground for several months at a time. The tunnels were their territory.|$|R

50|$|The West Water Tower and <b>Ground</b> <b>Storage</b> Tank are a {{historic}} water tower and storage tank located at 310 11th Avenue in Orion, Illinois. The tower and tank {{were built in}} 1928 {{as part of the}} village's new water system, which had been approved the previous year. The water system was introduced both as a response to several fires which had plagued the village and as an effort to bring modern technology and progress, among other civic concerns. The water tower consists of a steel tank with a hemispherical bottom supported by a steel trestle; the structure is 136.5 ft tall. The <b>ground</b> <b>storage</b> tank, located {{at the base of the}} tower, is made of redwood and holds 30,000 gal of water.|$|E

These digs have uncovered and marked the foundations of all major building on the site including headquarters, officers and troops quarters, parade <b>grounds,</b> <b>storage</b> and livestock stockade. A small theatre that shows a 20-minute history of the fort, a museum with collected artifacts and a reconstructed blacksmith shop with period cannons, caissons, tack and other equipment is behind the museum. There is space on the park for RV and trailer parking with some facilities. The park is only open during the summer months. Reenactors fire the authentic cannon every year on 4 July weekend ceremonies.|$|R

50|$|In the USA, {{storage tanks}} operate under no (or very little) pressure, {{distinguishing}} them from pressure vessels.

There are usually many environmental regulations applied to the design and operation of storage tanks, often depending {{on the nature of the}} fluid contained within. Above <b>ground</b> <b>storage</b> tanks (AST) differ from underground (UST) storage tanks in the kinds of regulations that are applied.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors when low energy houses are built is to have good heat recovery on the ventilation system. However, standard ventilation units use a considerable amount of electricity. This article discusses the consequences on a system level of using hybrid ventilation with heat recovery. The simulation program TRNSYS was used in order to investigate a ventilation system with heat recovery. The system also includes a <b>ground</b> source <b>storage</b> and waste water heat recovery system. The result of the analysis shows that the annual energy gain from <b>ground</b> source <b>storage</b> is limited. However, this is partly a consequence {{of the fact that the}} well functioning hybrid ventilation system leaves little room for improvements. The analysis shows that the hybrid ventilation system has potential to be an attractive solution for low energy buildings with a very low need for electrical energy...|$|R
5000|$|The Duchy of Cornwall runs a [...] "boat park" [...] at Porthloo, {{providing}} <b>ground</b> <b>storage</b> of boats, including ones {{too large}} for storing on-land elsewhere on St Mary's. There is a wide slipway leading across the beach, partially sheltered by Newford Island, which is used (in addition to the boat park) by landing barges, loading items which the St Mary's Harbour quay (at Hugh Town) cannot handle, such as large vehicles and machinery.

50|$|The {{distribution}} system of Dallas Water Utilities (DWU) {{is one of}} the largest in the United States. As of June 2003, DWU provided retail water service to just over 1.2 million people within the Dallas city limits. The major {{distribution system}} facilities include 28 pump stations (including the high service pump stations at the three water treatment plants), 11 <b>ground</b> <b>storage</b> reservoirs, 9 elevated tanks, and 78 vault structures separate from the major facilities, in addition to over 4600 mi of distribution and transmission main. The distribution system is divided into 17 pressure zones to maintain adequate water pressures throughout the system. There are four major pressure zones (Central Low,North High, East High, and South High), and five smaller secondary pressure zones (Meandering Way High, Red Bird High, Trinity Heights, Pleasant Grove, and Cedardale) which comprise most of the Dallas service area. Each of the nine major and secondarypressure zones are supplied by one or more pump stations and have elevated or <b>ground</b> <b>storage</b> facilities that establish the static hydraulic gradient for each zone. The remaining eight pressure zones are supplied from an adjacent pressure zone via pressure reducing valve, or single, small booster pump station. These pressure zones do not have storage facilities that establish their static hydraulic gradient.|$|E
