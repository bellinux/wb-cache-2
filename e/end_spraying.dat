40|$|In This Issue: HERBICIDE APPLICATION Weed {{control with}} {{herbicides}} {{depends on the}} uniform application of dependable herbicides. A sprayer is needed which will allow for both uniform application and correct droplet size at desired spray volumes. The sprayer should be of sufficient capacity to handle the acreage involved. AGITATION Agitation of most spray solutions is necessary. Any separation will vary the spray concentration. For a simple orifice jet agitator, a flow of 6 gallons per minute for every 100 gallons of tank capacity is usually adequate. SPRAY BOOMS The use of gauge wheels helps maintain the proper distance between the spray nozzle and the target especially on uneven ground, going across terraces, etc. A spray boom where the height and angle of the spray nozzles can be changed is also desirable. The supply lines to and on the spray boom must be of adequate size for even distribution. It is best to have the supply line coming {{to the center of}} the spray boom section and distribute from that point rather than coming in on the <b>end</b> of the <b>spray</b> boom and running the chance of less pressure at the far end.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The air-assisted ground spray {{is fairly}} widespread. However, {{due to the}} {{unpredictable}} weather conditions, the operational efficiency is impaired by stops on grounds of low humidity and high temperatures. The aim of this work was to assess an air humidification method and evaluate its impact on temperature and air humidity for the air curtain of the air-assisted sprayer. With respect to relative air humidity, it has increased in 6. 59 %, being the maximum change when inserting 1. 92 L min- 1. So, it is concluded that the pipeline humidification might significantly reduce temperature and enhance air humidity.

40|$|Marked {{elevation}} of dioxin {{associated with the}} herbicide Agent Orange was recently found in 19 of 20 blood samples from persons living in Bien Hoa, a large city in southern Vietnam. This city is located near an air base that was used for Agent Orange spray missions between 1962 and 1970. A spill of Agent Orange occurred at this air base more than 30 years before blood samples were collected in 1999. Samples were collected, frozen, and sent to a World Health Organization-certified dioxin laboratory fm congener-specific analysis {{as part of a}} Vietnam Red Cross project. Previous analyses of more than 2200 pooled blood samples collected in the 1990 s identified Bien Hoa as one of several southern Vietnam areas with persons having elevated blood dioxin levels from exposure to Agent Orange. In sharp contrast to this study, our previous research showed decreasing tissue dioxin levels over time since 1970. Only the dioxin that contaminated Agent Orange, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlmodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), was elevated in the blood of 19 of 20 persons sampled from Bien Hoa. A comparison pooled sample from 100 residents of Hanoi, where Agent Orange was not used, measured blood TCDD levels of 2 parts per trillion (ppt).

40|$|The {{hypothetical}} {{impact of}} aerial spraying on tsetse fly populations is investigated. Spray cycles are scheduled at intervals two days {{short of the}} first interlarval period and halted once {{the last of the}} female flies that originated from pre-spray-deposited pupae have been sprayed twice. The effect of temperature on the aerial spraying of tsetse, through its reproductive cycle and general population dynamics, is of particular interest, given that cooler weather is preferred for the settling of insecticidal droplets. Spray efficacy is found to come at a price due to the greater number of cycles necessitated by cooler weather. The extra cost is argued to be worth while. Pupae, still in the ground at the <b>end</b> of <b>spraying,</b> are identified as the main threat to a successful operation. They are slightly more vulnerable at the low temperature extreme of tsetse habitat (16 ^∘C), when the cumulative, natural pupal mortality is high. One can otherwise base one's expectations on the closeness with which the time to the third last spray approaches one puparial duration. A disparity of anything close to the length of a spray cycle advocates caution, whereas one which comes close to vanishing should be interpreted as being auspicious. Three such key temperatures, just below which one can anticipate an improved outcome and just above which caution should be exercised, are 17. 146 ^∘C, 19. 278 ^∘C and 23. 645 ^∘C. A refinement of the existing formulae for the puparial duration and the first interlarval period might be prudent in the South African context of a sympatric Glossina brevipalpis-G. austeni, tsetse population.

30|$|The {{method of}} {{inoculation}} significantly impacted how the fungi performed within the logs, and fungi with different types of pigmentation appeared to prefer different methods of inoculation. Zone line producing fungi produced more zone lines when introduced into the logs in sterile plugs, while pink staining fungi performed better when sprayed onto the logs. Both methods are based in past literature, which includes pressing fungal mats against log <b>ends</b> [14, 15], <b>spraying</b> a mixture of distilled water and fungi on the logs [16 – 18], packing inoculated sawdust into drilled holes in the log [19], and using inoculated plugs to deliver active cultures directly into the wood [20]. Although spray inoculation was more effective with S. cuboidea, {{it is possible that}} the opening of the sapwood for spray inoculation also partially inhibited the pink stain production. As noted by Leatham [20], inoculum generally performs better when the bark is retained, as the bark helps maintain moisture content, insulates against temperature changes, and can inhibit the colonization by airborne contaminants. An inoculation method which enables entire surface coverage without exposing large portions of the internal wood would be ideal, but would be exceptionally difficult to achieve.|$|R

40|$|HVOF {{coatings}} {{have shown}} high {{resistance to corrosion}} in fossil energy applications and it is generally accepted that mechanical failure, e. g. cracking or spalling, ultimately will determine coating lifetime. The high velocity oxygen-fuel method (HVOF) for applying coatings {{is one of the}} most commercially viable and allows the control of various parameters including powder particle velocity and temperature which influence coating properties, such as residual stress, bond coat strength and microstructure. The mechanical durability of coatings is being assessed using a dual eddy current coil method to monitor crack formation in real time during thermal cycling. Absolute impedence signals from two coils, which interrogate two different areas on the sample, are collected. Crack detection can be determined from the differential signal generated from these absolute signals. The coils are operated at two different frequencies, resulting in two differential signals used for crack detection. Currently this crack detection method is being used to elucidate the influence of thermal cycling temperature and coating thickness on cracking. Recent results (cycles to failure) will be presented for FeAl coatings thermally sprayed (HVOF) onto carbon steel to two coating thicknesses (160 microns and 250 microns thick) and subsequently cycled at temperatures up to 700 oC. Thinner coatings exhibit greater resistance to cracking. Ultimately the resistance to cracking will be used to explore the relationship between HVOF spraying parameters, the mechanical properties of the coating and coating bond strength to develop optimized thermal spray parameters. To this <b>end</b> thermal <b>spray</b> coatings (FeAl and Fe 3 Al) have been applied to additional alloy substrates (Grade 91 steel, 316 SS, etc.) relevant to the fossil industry.

The room temperature mechanical strength and coating adhesion to the substrate is also of considerable importance.

40|$|Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has {{developed}} thermally conductive composite liners for corrosion and scale protection in heat exchanger tubes exposed to geothermal brine. The liners cannot withstand roller expansion {{to connect the}} tubes to the tubesheet. It {{is not possible to}} line the ends of the tubes with the same material after roller expansion {{due to the nature of}} the current liner application process. It was requested that BNL evaluate plasma sprayed Ni-Al coatings for safe ending heat exchanger tubes exposed to geothermal brine. The tubes of interest had an internal diameter of 0. 875 inches. It is not typical to thermal spray small diameter components or use such small standoff distances. In this project a nozzle extension was developed by Zatorski Coating Company to <b>spray</b> the tube <b>ends</b> as well as flat coupons for testing. Four different Ni-Al coatings were investigated. One of these was a ductilized Ni-AIB material developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The coatings were examined by optical and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the coatings were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and subjected to corrosion, tensile adhesion, microhardness and field tests in a volcanic pool in New Zealand. It was determined that the Ni-Al coatings could be applied to a depth of two inches on the tube <b>ends.</b> When <b>sprayed</b> on flat coupons the coatings exhibited relatively high adhesion strength and microhardness. Polarization curves showed that the coating performance was variable. Measured corrosion potentials indicated that the Ni-Al coatings are active towards steel coated with thermally conductive polymers, thereby suggesting preferential corrosion. Corrosion also occurred on the coated coupons tested in the volcanic pool. This may have been exacerbated by the difficulty in applying a uniform coating to the coupon edges. The Ni-Al coatings applied to the tubes had significant porosity and did not provide adequate corrosion protection. This is associated with the short standoff distance and is not a reflection of the normal quality of plasma sprayed coatings. Even if coating porosity could be reduced, the coupling of an alloy coating to a polymer-based barrier coating in the same electrolyte is not recommended. Therefore, polymer coatings that can be field applied to the tube ends after roller expansion should be sought...|$|R
40|$|For the {{optimization}} of fuel injection, {{measurement techniques}} {{with a high}} temporal resolution below one millisecond are required to resolve the fuel spray velocity field in time. Since the measurement rate is usually too low to capture the temporal behavior of a single injection at once, a single measurement is performed during the injection and the injection is repeated with a variable time delay of the measurement. Consequently, non-stationary characteristics of the fuel spray cannot be resolved. For this purpose, a high measurement rate 1 kHz is necessary {{in addition to the}} high temporal resolution. While time-resolved particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) is capable of achieving such high measurement rates, Doppler global velocimetry (DGV) is either too slow or is restricted to velocity profile (1 d) measurements. However, DGV {{is considered to be a}} useful alternative or complement to PIV due to its high optical robustness. For this reason, the frequency modulated DGV is enhanced to provide field (2 d) measurements with rates of 1 kHz. This is achieved either by using a micro scanner or by applying a high-speed camera. Both setups provided time-resolved velocity field measurements in a spray test object without repetition of the spray cycle. During each single run, the same characteristic oscillations were identified and the decrease of the velocity at the <b>ending</b> of the <b>spray</b> injection was resolved. Hence, the technique is applicable for analyzing transient, non-stationary spray phenomena...|$|R
40|$|In an {{industrial}} Fluid CokerTM, liquid bitumen is injected into {{a bed of}} hot coke particles through spray nozzles, grouped in several banks at different vertical positions. The main objective of this thesis is to determine whether significant improvements in liquid-solid contact could be achieved by optimizing {{the location of the}} spray nozzles. In the coker regions where bitumen is injected, the gas is a mixture of product vapors and steam. Steam introduced at different levels rises through the coker: the stripping steam is injected near the bottom, then the attrition steam above the stripper and finally the bitumen atomization steam. As a result, the cross-sectional averaged gas velocity greatly varies vertically, from the lowest spray bank to the highest spray bank. In addition, there are large radial variations in gas velocity, as gas bubbles tend to concentrate in the central region of the bed. In this study, the impacts on liquid-solid contact of gas velocity and uneven gas distribution were investigated. The effects of spray pulsations and atomization gas flowrate on liquid distribution were also studied. Effects of bed hydrodynamics on the initial liquid distribution and on the subsequent drying were studied separately. The results indicate that jet pulsations or increasing the atomization gas flowrate improve the liquid distribution. Large improvements in liquid distribution were achieved by increasing the superficial gas velocity and also increasing the gas velocity at the <b>end</b> of the <b>spray</b> jet cavity, for all types of spray jets, pulsating or non-pulsating...|$|R

Agent Orange herbicide, contaminated with TCDD, was sprayed in Vietnam between 1962 and 1971 primarily {{for use as a}} defoliant. Typical blood TCCD levels are 2 ppt in Vietnamese, but levels are as high as 413 ppt in Bien Hoa City.

Extremely elevated soil TCDD samples, over 1 million ppt, and elevated TCDD in sediment were found in some nearby areas such as Bien Hung Lake. The primary route of intake of almost all dioxins in humans is food. However, in our prior studies in Bien Hoa, food was unavailable for dioxin analysis so the route of intake was not confirmed. In the 1970 s, while Agent Orange was still being sprayed, elevated human milk TCDD levels as high as 1850 were detected in milk from Vietnamese people living in Agent Orange-sprayed areas where consumption of fish was high. Furthermore, also in the 1970 s, elevated TCDD levels (up to 810 ppt) were found in fish and shrimp from the same area as the milk donors. In the 1980 s, we found elevated TCDD and also other organohalogen levels in human tissue, pork, fish, a turtle, an...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Technology) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1994 Pesticides are {{generally}} used in south-Africa {{for the control}} of various pests; from insects and fungi to weeds. The agricultural industry is probably the biggest user of pesticides and therefore workers {{in this part of}} the labour force have the biggest risk of being exposed to the hazards of these essential products. During the 1988 / 89 deciduous fruit season the deciduous fruit industry earned approximately R 1000 million in foreign exchange. It is therefore very important for this industry to produce fruit of high quality in a very competitive market. Of the total deciduous exports, apples comprised approximately 62, 5 %. The EIgin-Grabouw area is the biggest producer of apples. This industry is clearly very dependant on pesticides to protect its crops against pests. From time to time farm - workers are exposed to pesticides, a study was therefore performed to access the levels of exposure of farm workers. Blood and urine samples were collected in a comprehensive biological monitoring program in the Elgin area to determine, uusing clinical tests, the level of exposure to pesticides. It was decided later that the determination of pesticide residues in blood would form part of this main study. Other tests included serum and red cell cholinesterase. Samples were collected during August (start of spraying season), November (midseason) and February (<b>end</b> of <b>spraying</b> season). A multi-residue method was developed to extract organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides in whole blood. Although various methods exist, they allow only for the extraction of either organophosphates or organochlorines and not multi-residue extractions. This multi-residue method is based on the liquid/liquid extraction of a blood/Celite/ethanol mixture to extract the following pesticides: Azinphos-methyl, Chlorpyrifos, Endosulfan, Methidathion and Prothiophos. The pesticide residue levels were determined on gas chromatographs equipped with DB- 5 and DB- 2 I 0 capillary columns and flame photometric-, electron capture- and nitrogen/phosphorous detectors. The results were confirmed on a gas chromatograph with mass-selective detector in selective ion mode. Of the 402 blood samples analysed, 23 samples showed positive for organophoshates and 29 for organochlorines, and were sent for analysis on the mass spectrometer. Of those samples only one could be positively identified. The presence of the pesticide Endosulfan-B was confirmed. The confirmation of the pesticides was complicated by interfering substances that leached from the rubber stoppers of the collection vessels into the blood. Although the study showed that for practical purposes no pesticides were present, other important information was obtained about the handling and analyses of blood samples for pesticides...|$|R
