500|$|My Dinosaur Life was {{released}} to acclaim from music critics upon its debut on January 19, 2010, and it represented the band's all-time best chart performance, peaking at number 15 on the Billboard 200. The group supported Weezer on several dates during this time, {{and they began}} a headlining tour in late January in the US. In {{the first three months}} following the album's release, the band continued to tour heavily: they travelled to Australia for the national Soundwave festival, as well as to Japan and the UK. The band began to receive radio airplay {{for the first time in}} their career, and released a music video for the single [...] "Her Words Destroyed My Planet". They embarked on a large tour with Say Anything between October and November 2010, and premiered a self-shot video for [...] "A Lifeless Ordinary" [...] during that time. Columbia dropped the band later that year, with the commercial performance of My Dinosaur Life leading to the split. [...] "I guess we didn't do as well as they hoped or expected us to," [...] said Pierre that year. [...] "And we felt that having all their resources at our disposal would perhaps propel us into another dimension. But we are what we are regardless of what label or machine <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> <b>us.</b> We did exceptionally well, though, if you want to look strictly at sales numbers in today's climate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Argile Smith, the {{executive}} vice president, {{the vice president}} of Integration of Faith and Learning, and Aguillard's eventual interim successor as the LC president, said, [...] "The faculty, staff, and students, have been so supportive through this journey. Our President has shown us how to work through a crisis with the kind of integrity that comes from a resilient relationship with Christ. Now that the crisis <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> <b>us,</b> Louisiana College can get back to fulfilling our mission, 'to change the World for Christ!'".|$|E
2500|$|The {{fact that}} English has words like {{before and after}} that are (currently or archaically) polysemous between 'front/earlier' or 'back/later' may seem to refute the claims {{regarding}} Aymara uniqueness. However, these words relate events to other events and {{are part of the}} moving-events metaphor. In fact, when before means in front of ego, it can mean only future. For instance, our future is laid out before us while our past <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> <b>us.</b> Parallel Aymara examples describe future days as qhipa uru, literally 'back days', and they are sometimes accompanied by gestures to behind the speaker. The same applies to Quechua speakers, whose expression qhipa p'unchaw corresponds directly to Aymara qhipa uru. [...] Possibly, the metaphor is that the past is visible to us (in front of our eyes) while the future is not.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 June 2005 Foreign Minister Shalom sent {{a letter}} of apology to the New Zealand {{government}} saying, [...] "In this context, we wish to express our regret for the activities {{which resulted in the}} arrest and conviction of two Israel citizens in New Zealand on criminal charges and apologize for the involvement of Israeli citizens in such activities. Israel commits itself to taking steps to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents in the future." [...] Diplomatic relations were fully re-established on 30 August 2005 when Naftali Tamir presented his credentials, which were accepted, to Governor-General Dame Silvia Cartwright before a guard of honour. The Foreign Minister's deputy director for Asia and the Pacific, Amos Nadav, said, [...] "We are happy the crisis <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> <b>us</b> and look ahead to the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Motion City Soundtrack {{released}} {{their fourth}} studio album, My Dinosaur Life, on Columbia Records. The band had signed to the label two years prior, {{and it was}} the band’s major-label debut. The album peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200, representing a career best, and earned strong reviews. However, Columbia dropped the band later that year, with the commercial performance of My Dinosaur Life leading to the split.

2500|$|In early 2013, Applewhite {{admitted}} he was disciplined by the University of Texas for [...] "having an inappropriate {{relationship with a}} student at the 2009 Fiesta Bowl." [...] The student was employed by the football team as an athletic trainer. [...] Texas A.D. DeLoss Dodds reprimanded Applewhite by freezing his salary and requiring him to undergo counseling. [...] In a public statement Applewhite commented on the affair: [...] "Several years ago, I made a regretful decision resulting in behavior that was totally inappropriate. It was a one-time occurrence and was a personal matter. ... Through counsel I have worked with my wife and the incident <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> <b>us.</b> I am regretful for my mistake and humbled by this experience. I am deeply sorry for the embarrassment it has caused my friends, family, and the University." [...] The revelation occurred in the wake of investigation into Texas track coach Beverly Kearney's relationship with a student athlete.|$|E

6000|$|There was one sight visible {{every night}} to all men which might well nerve the rescuers in their enterprise. Over the {{northern}} horizon, behind those hills of danger, there quivered {{up in the}} darkness one long, flashing, quivering beam, which swung up and down, and up again like a seraphic sword-blade. It was Kimberley praying for help, Kimberley solicitous for news. Anxiously, distractedly, the great De Beers searchlight dipped and rose. And back across the twenty miles of darkness, over the hills where Cronje lurked, there came that other southern column of light which answered, and promised, and soothed. 'Be of good heart, Kimberley. We are here! The Empire <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> <b>us.</b> We have not forgotten you. It may be days, {{or it may be}} weeks, but rest assured that we are coming.' ...|$|E

I can imagine the mind {{reacting}} upon matter, creating {{in its own right}} by the displacement and rearrangement of the molecules of a substance--say of wood. What is a wine-glass but an appearance? No, no! It will not do to be dogmatic. We must not assume too much. We must keep open minds. Are we not advancing? Is any one nearing the farther wall? No, my boy, each year should make us less arrogant. Ten thousand years from now men will still be discovering new laws of nature just as they were ten thousand years ago. It is childish to suppose that we or any other generation will know all that is to be known. Infinite research is before us just as infinite painful groping <b>is</b> <b>behind</b> <b>us.</b> I do not assume to say what the future will bring to mankind. Perhaps soon--very soon, science will shift its entire battle-line from matter to mind. To say the mind is conditioned in a certain way to-day does not mean that these conditions may not utterly change to-morrow. Great discoveries wait in the future." ...|$|E
