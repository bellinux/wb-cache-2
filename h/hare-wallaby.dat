It contains numerous rare, endangered and priority flora. It also supports a number of rare or endangered fauna, including some that fall within the critical weight range for predation by foxes. The pig-footed bandicoot (Chaeropus ecaudatus) and crescent nailtail wallaby (Onychogalea lunata) previously occurred in the subregion, but both are now extinct. The rufous <b>hare-wallaby</b> (Lagorchestes hirsutus) is now extinct in the wild, and a further ten species of mammal are extinct in the subregion. The endangered red-tailed phascogale (Phascogale calura) still occurs in the region, as do the vulnerable black-flanked rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis) and heath rat (Pseudomys shortridgei), and the western brush wallaby (Macropus irma).|$|E

40|$|Sex ratio, reproduction, body {{condition}} and morphology of banded (Lagostrophus fasciatus) and rufous (Lagorchestes hirsutus) <b>hare-wallabies</b> were assessed on Dorre and Bernier Islands. Data {{are derived from}} 236 banded <b>hare-wallabies</b> and 161 rufous <b>hare-wallabies</b> captured between 1959 and 1999. The sex ratio of captured banded <b>hare-wallabies</b> tended to be female-biased (0. 79 : 1 male: female) but {{was not a significant}} departure from parity. In contrast, pouch young tended towards a male bias at 1. 35 : 1. Females produced 1 - 2 young per year. They were capable of producing young at 1000 g, but the incidence of females carrying pouch young or lactating increased from 39 % for females of 1000 - 1400 g to 80 % for females of 1401 - 1800 g, then decreased slightly to 76 % for females > 1800 g. Births occurred throughout the year but there was some indication of a decline {{in the latter half of}} the year. Captured banded <b>hare-wallabies</b> ranged in weight from 850 to 2300 g. Animals on Dorre Island were in significantly better {{body condition}} than those on Bernier Island, although this could be an artefact of their shorter pes length. There was no evidence of sexual dimorphism and no differences in morphological measurements taken, other than pes length, between the two island populations. The sex ratio of captured rufous <b>hare-wallabies</b> was close to parity at 0. 99 : 1 and for pouch young tended to be male-biased at 2 : 1. The smallest female with young weighed 1215 g, but the incidence of females carrying pouch young or lactating increased from 43 % for females of 1215 - 1660 g to 61 % for females of 1661 - 2015 g and 100 % for females > 2015 g. Females carried pouch young in all months sampled (March-September) and one incidence of twinning was noted. Captured rufous <b>hare-wallabies</b> weighed 600 - 2550 g. Body condition was similar for males and females and between islands, but smaller females of reproductive age were in poorer body condition than larger females. There was no evidence of sexual dimorphism but pes lengths of animals on Dorre Island were significantly shorter, head lengths longer and tail lengths shorter, than those on Bernier Island. Rufous <b>hare-wallabies</b> appear to show regional variation in body size, being smaller in the wetter and warmer Tanami/Alice Springs region and larger on the drier and cooler Shark Bay islands...|$|R

40|$|The diet of Wedge-tailed Eagles Aquila audax was {{assessed}} {{from a single}} nest on Bernier Island and two nests on Heirisson Prong at Shark Bay, Western Australia. The nests and their immediate surrounds were searched for mammalian skulls and the numbers of each species recorded. The nest at Bernier Island was examined annually between July 1992 and October 1995 and the two nests on eirisson Prong in October 1995. Banded <b>Hare-wallabies</b> were the most abundant prey item found in the Bernier Island nest over the four year period comprising 53. 0 % of all skulls, followed by Rufous <b>Hare-wallabies</b> at 35. 9 %, Burrowing Bettongs at 8. 5 % and fish at 2. 6 %. On Heirisson Prong, one bettong skull and 91 rabbit skulls were collected. Wedge-tailed Eagles displayed a preference for larger prey items on both Bernier Island and Heirisson Prong. They are diurnal predators but on Bernier Island their prey species are largely nocturnal. Possible hunting techniques are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Spectacled <b>hare-wallabies</b> (Lagorchestes conspicillatus) and euros (Macropus robustus isabellinus) {{occur on}} Barrow I. at densities of 42 and 8 km- 2, respectively, which result in {{estimates}} {{of total population}} sizes of c. 10000 and 1800, respectively. Spectacled <b>hare-wallabies</b> occur throughout the island in all habitat types; euros tend to be concentrated in the deeply dissected country in the central-west of the island. Limited areas of floodout flats are important feeding areas for euros, being the only major habitat on the island dominated by grasses other than Triodia. There {{was no significant difference}} between density of either species on the two halves of the island (one half is dominated by a commercial oilfield; the other is relatively undisturbed). Barrow I. is the smallest island off the Australian coast to have successfully supported a population of large macropods for the 8000 - 10000 years since separation from the mainland by rising sea-level. Hence, the population estimate of euros on Barrow I. provides an empirical measure of the viable population size necessary for the long-term survival of large macropods. This estimate is nearly two orders of magnitude less than that estimated from a theoretical model of minimum viable population size (Belovsky 1987) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{an effort}} {{to learn more about}} the {{potential}} for reintroduction of <b>hare-wallabies</b> to sites in Australia, 34 captive-bred <b>hare-wallabies</b> were released onto Peron Peninsula within the Shark Bay World Heritage Property in 2001 as part of an experimental reintroduction program. One objective of this experiment was to characterise their behaviour and daytime refugia to identify suitable habitat for future releases. The mala (Lagorchestes hirsutus) and merrnine (Lagostrophus fasciatus) were fitted with radio-transmitters and tracked daily. Merrnine were more faithful to a previously occupied shelter than mala. Mala maintained a solitary daytime habit at all times. Within the study area, mala preferentially sought low-lying vegetation primarily comprising the species Lamarchea hakeifolia, which provided dense cover up to 1 m in height, under which they constructed scrapes. L. hakeifolia was preferred as shelter vegetation instead of Triodia (spinifex) hummocks, despite Triodia hummock habitat being preferred by mala in central Australia. Merrnine occupied taller vegetation with an open understorey to 1. 5 m, although the extremity of the understorey remained dense at this height. Individual merrnine sometimes sheltered with conspecifics of the opposite sex. Since both species utilised floristically and structurally variable vegetation, we suggest that they have the ability to cope with vegetation that has been altered by changes in fire regimes and introduced herbivores. This is particularly important for future reintroduction exercises as the results suggest that vegetation characteristics required to support these species, particularly mala, may be variable rather than limited to perceived necessary habitat types in central Australia or on islands. These results should allow future reintroduction projects to consider a wider range of release-site options during their planning phase. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} tables which summarize probable {{changes in}} populations of Australian Macropodoidea, and probable causes, since white settlement. Of 50 species, 30 have suffered declines in range and/or numbers and 14 {{are thought to}} have increased or remained essentially stable. Six species have declined to extinction and an additional four are extinct on the mainland. Only about half, 28 species, remain common where they now occur. Habitat changes are likely to be the major causative agents of change, whether positive or negative; the most important are the clearing of forests, pastoralism and grazing. Feral animals may have been significant in the decline of five species. Despite the losses, the full range of macropod genera is still well represented, by good luck rather than good management. Tree-kangaroos, <b>Hare-wallabies</b> and Nailtaill Wallabies are most in need of active conservation if diversity is to be preserved...|$|R
5000|$|There are 11 {{species of}} brush {{wallabies}} (g. Macropus, s.g. Protemnodon). Their head and body length is 45 to 105 cm and the tail is 33 to 75 cm long. The six named species of rock-wallabies (g. Petrogale) live among rocks, usually near water; two species are endangered. The {{two species of}} <b>hare-wallabies</b> (g. Lagorchestes) are small animals that have the movements {{and some of the}} habits of hares. Often called [...] "pademelons", the three species of scrub wallabies (g. Thylogale) of New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and Tasmania are small and stocky, with short hind limbs and pointed noses. They are hunted for meat and fur. A similar species is the short-tailed scrub wallaby, or quokka (Setonix brachyurus); this species is now restricted to two offshore islands of Western Australia. The three named species of forest wallabies (g. Dorcopsulus) are native to the island of New Guinea. The dwarf wallaby is the smallest member of the genus and the smallest known member of the kangaroo family. Its length is about 46 cm from nose to tail, and it weighs about 1.6 kg.|$|R

50|$|The Lake Mackay <b>hare-wallaby</b> {{was found}} in the central and western deserts of Australia up until {{sometime}} between the 1940s and 1960s. Oral history states that it was present in the Tanami Desert of the Northern Territory of Australia until the late 1940s and in the Gibson Desert until the early 1960s. Within these deserts, the Lake-Mackay <b>hare-wallaby</b> inhabited sand plains and dunes that contained spinifex. The land in these regions is primarily sandy clay soils filled with salt and halophytic grasses and shrubs. These grasses and shrubs are commonly known as spinifex and mulga. The Lake Mackway <b>hare-wallaby</b> would use the leafy shrubs as coverage for their burrows, especially in hot weather. Not only did the plants help with sheltering them, but they were also a primary food source.|$|E
