5|$|Humanity survives in the aftermath, but {{the world}} {{experiences}} an ice age outside of Kazamatsuri. In the city, a huge tree grows 500 meters tall in three years, which contains the orb of light from Kotarou and Kagari. The five heroines, now in high school, investigate the tree {{as members of the}} occult research society and transform Kotarou into a familiar, but he refuses to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> demand. Kotarou takes the girls to the Moon where they are shown circled around a seedling (as the embodiment of the Moon's Kagari) sprouting on the otherwise barren regolith.|$|E

Once there, the party gets into a battle with minions of the Warlock Lord and find that the Sword of Shannara has already been removed. The party then learns of the Warlock Lord's invasion of the Southland, and decide to split up to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> can to stop it.|$|E

25|$|Despite Piye's {{successful}} campaign {{into the}} Delta, his authority only extended northward from Thebes {{up to the}} western desert oases and Herakleopolis where Peftjauawybast ruled as a Nubian vassal king. The local kings of Lower Egypt—especially Tefnakht—were essentially free to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted without Piye's oversight. It was Shabaka, Piye's successor, who later rectified this unsatisfactory situation by attacking Sais and defeating Tefnakht's successor Bakenranef there, in his second regnal year.|$|E
25|$|In {{that same}} year 1990, {{together}} with Anatoly Kalashnikov, Brusilovsky got a private commission to paint eleven canvasses, sized 1.5 х 2 m, {{in the style of}} interior painting. When the project was complete, the client unexpectedly went abroad. He refused to collect the canvasses, and gave the artists permission to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted with the paintings. Misha Brusilovsky kept the paintings in his studio for many years, and only in 2013 were they exhibited to the general public.|$|E

25|$|An {{essential}} {{question of}} practical reason for Hume was {{whether or not}} standards or principles exist (and if they <b>do,</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are) for practical reason, that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people’s intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for practical reason as a principle to exist, although other philosophers such as Christine Korsgaard, Jean Hampton, and Elijah Millgram claim that Hume {{is not so much}} of an anti-rationalist as he is just a skeptic of practical reason.|$|E
25|$|Defenders {{of the use}} of bank {{interest}} (principally M.A.Khan and M.O.Farooq) reply that that orthodox opponents provide scant evidence that interest is to blame for what the orthodox allege or that banning interest would <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> say it would. Often legitimate complaints about world financial status quo (economic inequality, over indebtedness and speculation, providing for riskless markets that don't need funds at the expense of slightly more risky market that could use finance) are used to draw illegitimate conclusions that the solution is a ban on all interest.|$|E
25|$|The {{standards}} {{of a professional}} relationship between art therapists and clients are covered in this section. Within a professional relationship, art therapists are banned from engaging in exploitative relationships with current and former patients, students, interns, trainees, supervisors, or co-workers. The ATCB defines an exploitative relationship as anything involving sexual intimacy, romance, or borrowing or loaning money. Within professional relationships, therapists are to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> feel is best in the client's interest, shall not advance a professional relationship for their own benefit, and shall not steer their patients in the wrong direction.|$|E

25|$|Social {{networks}} are, in many cases, a good {{tool for}} avoiding costly market research. They are the shortest, fastest and most direct {{way to reach}} an audience through a person who, in that specific community, has more credibility than anyone. For example, an athlete ‘delivers’ to their sponsor a consumer base {{of millions of people}} who every day are interested in what they <b>do,</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> feel, what they consume. No need to go to a Nikeshop window to see Cristiano Ronaldo’s latest boots. He sells them for you directly via a Tweet.|$|E
25|$|The island governments, {{headed by}} their bailiffs, Victor Carey in Guernsey and Alexander Coutanche in Jersey, {{had been ordered}} by the British Government to remain on their islands to {{maintain}} law and order and to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could for the civilians. This put them under a duty of care. When the lieutenant governors, who were the King's representatives on each island, departed on 21 June 1940, their powers and duties were vested in the bailiffs, namely to protect the islands and their population, taking on {{the duties of the}} Lieutenant Governors added a further duty of care.|$|E
25|$|The {{plantation}} produced oranges, {{sea island}} cotton, indigo, okra, and other vegetables. Approximately 60 slaves were managed under the task system: each slave had a quota {{of work to}} do per day. When they were finished, they were allowed to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wished. Some slaves had personal gardens which they were allowed to cultivate, and from which they sold vegetables. Thirty-two cabins were constructed for and by the slaves, made from tabby, which made them durable, insulated, and inexpensive although labor-intensive. The cabins were located {{about a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) from the main house. Slaves were allowed to padlock their cabins and build porches that faced away from the main house. Both of these features were unusual for slave quarters in antebellum America.|$|E

25|$|The trio then confronts Paradox, who {{reveals that}} {{he comes from}} a future beyond Yusei's in which the world lies in ruins, and claims {{that the only way to}} fix it is to {{eliminate}} Duel Monsters from history. However, the three heroes protest that by doing so all the future events and people will be erased as well, and challenge him to a duel. By combining the powers of their key monsters, Yugi, Jaden and Yusei defeat Paradox, who disappears. After the duel, Yusei, Jaden and Yugi say that they will <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> can to make sure the future is not like Paradox's, and say goodbye and the latter two return to their respective time periods. New Domino City returns to normal, and Yusei finally can let go of the past and focus on the future.|$|E
25|$|Their concept artists {{looked to}} the team's {{favorite}} graphic novels for inspiration and the concept artwork by Ralph McQuarrie, Doug Chiang, Joe Johnston, and others {{who worked on the}} Star Wars films. They were given access to the Episode II script and concept art early on before the film came out. LucasArts created storyboarded scripts of their cutscenes and gave them to ILM, who developed them into cinematic cutscenes. Knoles envisioned the level layouts and then consulted with lead level designer David Wehr and his level designers. They created a bubble map of the levels which they worked from to determine details in what the player would face and be able to do. The team made a new engine for the game to be able to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted. The graphic designers worked concurrently with the level designers to create the environments, which the level designers then used to better visualize what they were trying to do. Knoles had previously been involved {{in the development of the}} Super Star Wars trilogy for the Super Nintendo and often referred to those games when describing certain aspects of Star Wars: Bounty Hunter to the team.|$|E
25|$|Productive {{behavior}} {{is defined as}} employee behavior that contributes positively to the goals and objectives of an organization. When an employee begins a new job, there is a transition period during {{which he or she}} may not contribute significantly. To assist with this transition an employee typically requires job-related training. In financial terms, productive behavior represents the point at which an organization begins to achieve some return on the investment it has made in a new employee. I/O psychologists are ordinarily more focused on productive behavior than job or task performance, including in-role and extra-role performance. In-role performance tells managers how well an employee performs the required aspects of the job; extra-role performance includes behaviors not necessarily required by job but nonetheless contribute to organizational effectiveness. By taking both in-role and extra-role performance into account, an I/O psychologist is able to assess employees' effectiveness (how well they <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were hired to do), efficiency (outputs to relative inputs), and productivity (how much they help the organization reach its goals). Three forms of productive behavior that I/O psychologists often evaluate include job performance, organizational citizenship behavior (see below), and innovation.|$|E
