5|$|When God Writes Your Love Story was {{received}} positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes Your Love Story to college students. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes Your Love Story {{in his book}} <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Really</b> Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing {{about the importance of}} listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Really</b> Loved Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes Your Love Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.|$|E
5|$|Darla's just misunderstood. Her {{intentions}} are pure, they're {{just kind of}} warped. From her perspective—first she has to eat—she just happens to eat people! Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E

500|$|Hawke has {{repeatedly}} denounced what he perceives {{to be an}} overemphasis placed {{on the importance of}} monogamy in romantic relationships: [...] "People have such a childish view of monogamy and fidelity. 'He's cheated so he's bad, she's cheated so she's bad', as opposed to a recognition that our species is not monogamous...Sexual fidelity can't be the whole thing you hang your relationship on. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> love somebody you want them to grow, but you don't get to define how that happens. They do." ...|$|E
500|$|Leigh was {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most beautiful actresses of her day, and her directors emphasised this in most of her films. When asked if she believed her beauty had been an impediment to being taken seriously as an actress, she said, [...] "People think that if you look fairly reasonable, you can't possibly act, and as I only care about acting, I think beauty can be a great handicap, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to look like the part you're playing, which isn't necessarily like you." ...|$|E

500|$|Naughty Dog {{consciously}} avoided action game stereotypes, including super-powered {{heroes and}} overly sexualized female characters. They included a large {{cast of characters}} {{to ensure that the}} story was character-driven rather than story-driven. Co-president of Naughty Dog Evan Wells stated, [...] "I honestly think that the key element, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to boil it down, is characters. People will tell a story, but if it's not a character-driven plot then you are missing something." [...] Many of these characters were specifically designed to highlight different facets of Nathan Drake's personality.|$|E
500|$|... "A lot {{of people}} think of Shane as a clear villain and that he did a bad thing. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> analyze that situation, he’s a good guy and has done the right thing at every turn. Because he's done that, and it’s not working out for him, it’s driving him crazy. So we really wanted to show that he’s a tragic figure much more than a villainous figure. It’s just a series of unfortunate {{situations}} that have led to him slowly losing himself in this world. Popping back in time and showing his concern for Rick and how he cares for Lori and Carl, I thought {{that would be a good}} thing to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Far Side Virtual mainly designates a {{space in}} society, or a mode of behaving. All of these things {{operating}} in synchronicity: like ringtones, flat-screens, theater, cuisine, fashion, sushi. I don't {{want to call it}} [...] "virtual reality," [...] so I call it Far Side Virtual. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to understand Far Side, first off, listen to [...] Debussy, and secondly, go into a frozen yogurt shop. Afterwards, go into an Apple store and just fool around, hang out in there. Afterwards, go to Starbucks and get a gift card. They have a book there on the history of Starbucks—buy this book and go home. If you do all these things you'll understand what Far Side Virtual is — because people kind of live in it already.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to UB40 and Brown, the soundtrack features reggae music from: Jimmy Cliff, Common Sense, Maxi Priest, Shaggy, Rayvon, and Betty Wright. [...] Mark Mancina wrote a techno track for the soundtrack {{based on his}} film score, titled [...] "Speed TK Re-mix", performed by Japanese musician Tetsuya [...] "TK" [...] Komuro. Other songs recorded specifically for the soundtrack include Priest's cover of [...] "The Tide Is High" [...] and Cliff's re-recording of his 1972 song [...] "You Can Get It <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Really</b> Want". [...] The Speed2: Cruise Control soundtrack album was released by Virgin Records on May 20, 1997, about one month before the film's release. The album features 12 songs, {{all of which are}} featured in the film; five of them were released as singles.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{went on to}} add: <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> analyze that, {{the most}} {{inspiration}} is probably deep inside a synesthesiac. So for us, 'seeing sounds' is what we relate to the most. We figured we'd make an album out of it. Energy and emotion was the criteria , but we made the music anticipating the [...] show.

We're facing this big monster of, of what we know is out there, of what we see, that big monster of energy.|$|E
500|$|... "Luxurious" [...] is an R ballad, whose {{instrumentation}} {{consists of}} keyboards and synthesizers. It {{is written in}} common time in the key of A minor. The song uses a descending i-vii-VI-V chord progression. The lyrics of the song include descriptions of wealth and riches, what one reviewer called [...] "a world of Egyptian cotton, cashmere, tuberoses, and, of course, diamonds". Stefani stated that [...] " [...] song really is more about a love relationship. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> listen to the lyrics, {{it has nothing to}} do with money or luxury. It has to do with love, being rich in love. I just wanted to think of a clever way to express how you have to work really hard for the rewards of that." [...] The single version of the song contains an additional verse from rapper Slim Thug for release to urban radio and clubs.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to continued Scouting activities, Coker {{has been involved}} in supporting ex–POWs for many years. In December 2004, he was elected Commander of his local POW chapter, the Tidewater ex-POW Association. In 2008, he was also serving as the head of a Virginia state ex–POW association. Coker and his wife are also active in church and civic activities, such as counseling young married couples. Coker still has nightmares from his time as a POW. Reflecting on his wartime experiences in a Veterans Day tribute to POWs, he said [...] "If you're never tested, you don't know...You're capable of a great deal more than you realize, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> set your mind to it. Look at me. I did it, and there's nothing special about me. I'm just another guy." [...] Coker went on to say part of that is [...] "...realizing there's something bigger than yourself..." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephanie McGrath of Jam! {{said the}} song is [...] "a nice break from the 'baby babys', 'yeah yeahs' and insistent drum beats that pepper the other songs" [...] of Oops!. David Veitch of the Calgary Sun {{compared}} the backing vocals to [...] "nicely old-fashioned shoo-be-doo-doos". Lyrically, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] alludes to how Spears wants to hear her boyfriend say he needs her {{all the way and}} that he loves her. Spears considered it a [...] "pure and delicate" [...] song. [...] "It's just one of those songs that pull you in. That's why I like it, and I like singing it as well," [...] she continued. [...] "I think they wrote it 'specially for me, because the lyrics of the song, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> listen... they're more of what I can relate to, 'cause they're kind of young lyrics, I think. I don't think Shania would probably sing some of the words that I'm saying." ...|$|E
500|$|The Independents radio critic Robert Hanks was unimpressed with Kneale's {{script for}} the {{dramatic}} sections, but praised {{the performance of}} Andrew Keir in the title role. [...] "Lesser actors would treat Kneale's downbeat script with a certain detachment, but Keir is prepared to charge even the most banal lines with a terror that's both a treat and a lesson." [...] Hanks also felt that The Fifties season as a whole, as demonstrated by The Quatermass Memoirs, had a somewhat misleading focus. [...] "You {{get the sense that}} a vogue for science fiction is being interpreted as the spirit of the Fifties, with emphasis being put on a handful of sci-fi films. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> wanted to read the age through its movies, you'd have to include Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, late Ealing and early Norman Wisdom, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. It's a lot to accommodate; perhaps sticking to terror is just less intimidating." ...|$|E

500|$|In December 1962, the Beatles {{concluded}} {{their fifth}} and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, {{they had agreed}} that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, {{in an effort to}} maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, [...] "Look, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> want to get in these bigger places, you're {{going to have to change}} – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ..." [...] Lennon said: [...] "We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage. He'd tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers, but he didn't want us suddenly looking square. He'd let us have our own sense of individuality." ...|$|E
500|$|Dave McKean drew {{most of the}} {{principal}} art, {{as well as the}} cover art of the graphic novel. In illustrating the story, McKean blends paintings, drawings, photography, and mixed-media collage to come up with striking page designs, and dense symbols. He has said that he was [...] "trying to make the book despite the subject, rather than because of it. At the end of the day, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> love to do Batman comics, then that's probably the best thing to do. Not liking them, and then trying to make something out of them is just a waste of time." [...] He also came to think that [...] "overpainted, lavish illustrations in every panel just didn't work. It hampers the storytelling." [...] McKean liberally uses symbolism, imagery, and surrealism, and many scenes involve the use of symbols to denote a particular psychological device. For example, a Greek inscription can be seen scratched on the doorway of Maxie Zeus's electroshock chamber, which translates into [...] "Discover thyself." [...] Much of this symbolism was later explained and expanded upon by the release of the 15th Anniversary Edition containing Morrison's annotated script.|$|E
500|$|A San Francisco Chronicle {{review of}} a 2012 concert judged her singing [...] "an {{impressive}} thing to witness, and Evancho's technical precision and enormous range only serve {{to make it seem}} less fluky", but felt that [...] "every selection sounded alike". A reviewer for The Denver Post wrote that Evancho [...] "displayed her famous combo of poise and articulation", but he noted [...] "the burden of being a kid soprano, a true phenomenon. People pay a lot to see you and orchestras line up to get you on their stage. But still folks wonder <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> comprehend your life; if you shouldn’t be home ... eating ice cream. ... And yet they rise to their feet, yet again, as you finish." [...] A Naples Daily News review stated: [...] "Her poise. Her control. Her range. ... Her voice and her performance exhausted all of the superlatives in the dictionary." [...] In 2013, an Atlanta reviewer commented: [...] "Her pure and well-formed vowel sounds touched the hearts of everyone at the concert." [...] A review in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called Evancho [...] "awesomely talented" [...] and [...] "technically flawless". The Buffalo News reviewer wrote: [...] "there is a poignancy to the sound of this mature voice coming out of this child. Her high notes are a joy." ...|$|E
