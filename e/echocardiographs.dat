40|$|IntroductionThe {{advent of}} {{universal}} health care coverage in the United States {{and the use of}} electronic health records can make the medical record a disease surveillance tool. The objective of our study was to identify criteria that accurately categorize acute coronary and heart failure events by using electronic health record data exclusively so that the medical record can be used for surveillance without manual record review.

40|$|ObjectiveSeventy-seven {{cases of}} native valve infective {{endocarditis}} {{as determined by}} the Duke criteria, were reviewed to determine the incidence and clinical features of multi-valvular endocarditis. MethodsFourteen of 77 patients (18 %) had multi-valvular endocarditis most commonly involving the mitral and aortic valves. Staphylococcus aureus (43 %) and viridans streptococci (36 %) were the most common organisms causing multi-valvular endocarditis. ResultsDefinite or probable vegetations were found in 50 % of the patients by two-dimensional transthoracic <b>echocardiograph</b> and/or transesophageal <b>echocardiograph,</b> and possible vegetations were detected in 21 %. The overall mortality in our series was 21 %; 29 % underwent valve replacement and 50 % were treated medically. The major complications of multi-valvular endocarditis were congestive heart failure (64 %), acute renal failure (50 %), embolic events (21 %), and splenic abscess/infarcts (21 %).

Six patients with cardiomyopathy were studied using 3 D echocardiography and the images were analysed to measure the repeatability of measurement by the semi-automated method, and used to compare measurements of stroke volume and ejection fraction with manual measurements. Within-patient stan-dard deviations of the semi-automated method were 14. 6 % and 16. 4 % of the group mean end diastolic and end systolic volumes respectively, and were significantly less than the between-patient standard deviations.

40|$|Images from {{standard}} two-dimensional <b>echocardiographs</b> do not {{lend themselves to}} the study of regional left ventricular wall movement because of poor definition of endocardium. An alternative method, based on a wide-angle phased array sector scanner has, therefore, been devised. Once the appropriate region of the heart has been identified, the scan rate is increased, and an array of 41 M-mode scans is produced, resulting in improved frequency response and endocardial definition. Each scan is digitised separately, and since their spatial orientation is known, the left ventricular image can be reconstituted by computer, and isometric or contour displays produced. Preliminary results, based on 40 patients, are presented showing examples of left ventricular wall movement. Regional abnormalities of amplitude or timing can be displayed with results similar to those of angiography, while disturbances of septal motion or wall thickness can be observed in greater detail than with other methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{rhythm of}} the heart endows us with not only a life {{insurance}} but also a barometer indicating any potential abnormalities. Hence the accurate measurement of heart motion has profound clinical benefit in assisting diagnostic decision making and yet remains a challenging issue to be confronted. Perceptibly, heart motion can be quantified manually from M-mode diagrams of <b>echocardiographs</b> which are created by way of sound waves while a patient is undergoing scanning. Alternatively, the motion can be monitored automatically by post-image processing techniques analyzing B-mode video sequences. This paper explores the feasibility of {{the application of the}} Lucas-Kanada-Tomasi algorithm towards the reconstruction of m-mode diagrams from 2 D sequences and tissue velocity curves from 3 D video clips for the left ventricle.

50|$|When {{using an}} <b>echocardiograph</b> (echo) to {{visualize}} the heart, strain can appear with the RV being enlarged and more round than typical. When normal, the RV is about {{half the size of}} the left ventricle (LV). When strained, it can be as large as or larger than the LV.

30|$|The {{difficulty}} {{in the analysis}} of mouse <b>echocardiograph</b> and electrocardiograph is due to the much higher beating rate and smaller size of their hearts compared to human ones (Cranefield, 1975). Since the dilation of cardiac chambers in ARVD patient is almost limited in right ventricle (Muthappan and Calkins, 2008), this may explain that <b>echocardiograph</b> of our KI mice does not show very obviously structural and functional abnormalities in the left ventricle. However, left ventricle enlargement (LVE), the most prevalent feature of ARVD 5 (Hodgkinson et al., 2013; Merner et al., 2008) was also observed in the KI mice. ARVD 5 patients have significantly extended QRS duration (Merner et al., 2008), while we did not observe this phenotype in our KI mice. The much highly beating rate of mouse hearts may explain the {{difficulty in}} detection of cardiac electrical disorders. Of note, the histological results revealed increasing fibrosis infiltration and adipocyte accumulation in Tmem 43 KI mouse hearts, which reemerged the histological characters of ARVD 5 in human patients (Hodgkinson et al., 2013; Merner et al., 2008). These findings suggest that the S 358 L mutation of TMEM 43 is deleterious.|$|R

40|$|Eighteen {{patients}} with Kawasaki disease underwent serial, cross sectional echocardiographic examinations {{to determine the}} extent and subsequent course of cardiac involvement in this disease. The mean follow up period was 12. 3 months. Cardiovascular complications were found in a total of 10 patients (55 %). Coronary artery aneurysms were detected in 6 patients (33 %), pericardial effusions in two, and one patient had electrocardiographic evidence suggesting inferior myocardial infarction. Coronary artery aneurysms, seen exclusively in infants less than 12 months of age, were found in four to regress over a mean period of 7. 5 months (range 1 to 13 months). Electrocardiogram, chest radiographs, and clinical examination were unhelpful in identifying those {{patients with}} coronary artery aneurysms. Eight patients (44 %) were hypertensive, though only two required treatment. While all patients have survived, serial cross sectional <b>echocardiographs</b> should be performed in children with Kawasaki disease to identify those at risk from potentially fatal complications...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} only modest {{clinical}} interest in exercise echocardiography because of the technical limitations of the procedure. Recognizing {{that there have been}} recent technical advances in the echocardiographic instruments and that echocardiography should, in theory, be an ideal technique for evaluating exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities, a clinically practical method of performing exercise echocardiograms was developed. By obtaining the echocardiograms immediately after treadmill exercise, with the patient sitting at the treadmill, a high percent of studies adequate for interpretation was obtained (92 %). The addition of echocardiography to the treadmill exercise test significantly enhanced the diagnostic yield. In addition, in cases of one and three vessel disease, exercise echocardiography identified stenosis in specific coronary arteries. In patients with two vessel disease and left circumflex obstruction, specific vessel identification was less reliable. A high percent of patients with multivessel disease developed wall motion abnormalities with exercise that persisted for at least 30 minutes. It is concluded that echocardiography performed immediately after exercise with the new generation of <b>echocardiographs</b> can be a practical and useful clinical tool...|$|E
