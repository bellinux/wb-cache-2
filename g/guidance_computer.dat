25|$|The Apollo <b>Guidance</b> <b>Computer</b> {{software}} {{influenced the}} design of Skylab, Space Shuttle and early fly-by-wire fighter aircraft systems. The AGC code was uploaded to the internet in 2003, and the software itself was uploaded by a former NASA intern to GitHub on July 7, 2016.|$|E
25|$|John S. Rigden is an alumnus and physicist. Eldon C. Hall was {{the lead}} design {{engineer}} of the Apollo <b>Guidance</b> <b>Computer</b> (AGC) at MIT. Carl Crouthamel earned his doctorate at the University of Chicago after graduating from ENC, {{is known for his}} work with Enrico Fermi on the U.S. project that produced the first atomic bomb, started the first program to build a gamma ray lens for use in astronomy, and has worked for the Argonne National Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|The Apollo <b>Guidance</b> <b>Computer</b> (AGC) is {{a digital}} {{computer}} produced for the Apollo {{program that was}} installed on board each Apollo Command Module (CM) and Lunar Module (LM). The AGC provided computation and electronic interfaces for guidance, navigation, {{and control of the}} spacecraft. The AGC had a 16-bit word length, with 15 data bits and one parity bit. Most of the software on the AGC was stored in a special read only memory known as core rope memory, fashioned by weaving wires through magnetic cores, though a small amount of read-write core memory was provided.|$|E

50|$|Most of the ATHENA <b>guidance</b> <b>computers</b> {{were given}} to universities. One is in the Smithsonian. One {{remained}} in use at Vandenberg AFB until it guided a last Thor-Agena launch in May 1972. It had guided over 400 missiles.|$|R
50|$|Delco Electronics used a {{small group}} of {{electronic}} designers and technicians at their facility in Goleta, California (near Santa Barbara, California) to do special assignable projects that were advanced or more state of the art. This facility was called Delco Systems Operations (formerly known as GM Defense Research Labs), a part of Delco Electronics Corporation at the time. Delco Systems Operations is the place where the Apollo Program's Lunar Rover Mobility Sub-system was developed and built, also the Apollo Program's <b>guidance</b> <b>computers</b> (Apollo PGNCS) and the Boeing 747 <b>guidance</b> <b>computers</b> (Delco Carousel IV) were developed and manufactured there. All Delco Electronics Motorsports products developed before 1994 were designed by this group. From 1994 to present, this activity is at Delco Electronics/Delphi in Kokomo, IN.|$|R
25|$|While the Block I version used 4,100 ICs, each {{containing}} a single three-input NOR gate, the later Block II version (used in the crewed flights) used 2,800 ICs, each with dual three-input NOR gates. The ICs, from Fairchild Semiconductor, were implemented using resistor-transistor logic (RTL) in a flat-pack. They were connected via wire wrap, and the wiring was then embedded in cast epoxy plastic. The {{use of a}} single type of IC (the dual NOR3) throughout the AGC avoided problems that plagued another early IC computer design, the Minuteman II <b>guidance</b> <b>computer,</b> which used a mix of diode-transistor logic and diode logic gates.|$|E
25|$|On January 22, 1968, Apollo 5 {{lifted off}} just before sunset. The Saturn IB worked perfectly, {{inserting}} {{the second stage}} and LM into a 163 x 222km orbit. The nose cone was jettisoned and after a coast of 43 minutes 52 seconds, the LM separated from its adapter, with a 167 x 222km orbit. After two orbits, the first planned 39 second descent engine burn was started, but aborted by the Apollo <b>Guidance</b> <b>Computer</b> after only 4 seconds. Shortly before launch there was a suspected fuel leak and {{a decision was made}} to delay arming the engine until the time of ignition.|$|E
25|$|Some {{software}} bugs {{have been}} linked to disasters. Bugs in code that controls the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine were directly responsible for patient deaths in the 1980s. In 1996, the European Space Agency's US$1billion prototype Ariane 5 rocket had to be destroyed less than a minute after launch due to a bug in the on-board <b>guidance</b> <b>computer</b> program. In June 1994, a Royal Air Force Chinook helicopter crashed into the Mull of Kintyre, killing 29. This was initially dismissed as pilot error, but an investigation by Computer Weekly convinced a House of Lords inquiry that it may have been caused by a software bug in the aircraft's engine-control computer.|$|E

5000|$|Nose Cone and Q-Ball: The {{nose cone}} of the LES {{contained}} {{an array of}} 8 pressure-measuring pitot tubes in a structure known as the [...] "Q-ball". These sensors were connected to the Command Module and Saturn launch vehicle <b>guidance</b> <b>computers,</b> allowing calculation of dynamic pressure (q) during atmospheric flight, and also the angle of attack {{in the event of}} an abort.|$|R
25|$|In 1958, Fairchild mesa {{transistors}} {{were considered}} for the D-17B Minuteman I <b>guidance</b> <b>computer,</b> {{but they did not}} meet military standards of reliability. Fairchild already had a solution in the planar technology of Hoerni proposed on December 1, 1957. In the spring of 1958, Hoerni and Last were spending nights on experiments with the first planar transistors. The planar technology later became the second most important event in the history of microelectronics, after the invention of the transistor, but in 1959 it went unnoticed. Fairchild announced the transition from mesa to planar technology in October 1960. However, Moore refused to credit this achievement to Hoerni, and in 1996 even attributing it to unnamed Fairchild engineers.|$|E
500|$|Five {{minutes into}} the descent burn, and [...] above {{the surface of the}} Moon, the LM {{navigation}} and <b>guidance</b> <b>computer</b> distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected [...] "1202" [...] and [...] "1201" [...] program alarms. Inside Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas, computer engineer Jack Garman told guidance officer Steve Bales it was safe to continue the descent, and this was relayed to the crew. The program alarms indicated [...] "executive overflows", meaning the <b>guidance</b> <b>computer</b> could not complete all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.|$|E

2500|$|Gemini was {{the first}} astronaut-carrying {{spacecraft}} to include an onboard computer, the Gemini <b>Guidance</b> <b>Computer,</b> to facilitate management and control of mission maneuvers. This computer, sometimes called the Gemini Spacecraft On-Board Computer (OBC), was {{very similar to the}} Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer. The Gemini <b>Guidance</b> <b>Computer</b> weighed [...] Its core memory had 4096 addresses, each containing a 39-bit word composed of three 13-bit [...] "syllables". All numeric data was 26-bit two's-complement integers (sometimes used as fixed-point numbers), either stored in the first two syllables of a word or in the accumulator. Instructions (always with a 4-bit opcode and 9 bits of operand) could go in any syllable.|$|E
50|$|The {{missiles}} are guided using radio control signals (sent {{on one of}} three channels) from the <b>guidance</b> <b>computers</b> at the site. The earlier S-75 models received their commands via two sets of four small antennas {{in front of the}} forward fins while the D model and later models used four much larger strip antennas running between the forward and middle fins. The guidance system at an S-75 site can handle only one target at a time, but it can direct three missiles against it. Additional missiles could be fired against the same target after one or more missiles of the first salvo had completed their run, freeing the radio channel.|$|R

2500|$|A {{predecessor}} to the GPS {{satellite navigation}} system, the Transit system (later called NAVSAT), was developed because the submarines {{needed to know}} their position at launch {{in order for the}} missiles to hit their targets. Two American physicists, William Guier and George Weiffenbach, at Johns Hopkins's Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), began this work in 1958. A computer small enough to fit through a submarine hatch was developed in 1958, the AN/UYK-1. It was used to interpret the Transit satellite data and send guidance information to the Polaris, which had its own <b>guidance</b> <b>computer</b> made with ultra miniaturized electronics, very advanced for its time, because there wasn't much room in a Polaris—there were 16 on each submarine. The Ship's Inertial Navigation System (SINS) was developed earlier to provide a continuous dead reckoning update of the submarine's position between position fixes via other methods, such as LORAN. This was especially important in {{the first few years of}} Polaris, because Transit was not operational until 1964. By 1965 microchips similar to the Texas Instruments units made for the Minuteman II were being purchased by the Navy for the Polaris. The Minuteman guidance systems each required 2000 of these, so the Polaris guidance system may have used a similar number. To keep the price under control, the design was standardized and shared with Westinghouse Electric Company and RCA. [...] In 1962, the price for each Minuteman chip was $50, the price dropped to $2 in 1968.|$|E
