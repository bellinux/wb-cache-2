There have been several trials investigating the efficacy of different drugs for PPMS without positive results. Drugs tested include <b>interferon</b> <b>beta,</b> mitoxantrone, glatiramer acetate or riluzole. People with PPMS have also been included in trials of azathioprine, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.|$|E

25|$|In the {{diagnosis}} of type I diabetes, elevated anti-sulfatide antibodies in serum arise. Such anti-sulfatide antibodies prevent insulin secretion and exocytosis. However, {{research has shown that}} when non-obese diabetic mice are treated with sulfatide, it reduces the possible occurrence of diabetes from 85% in control animals to 35% in experimental animals. Sulfatide is also commonly known to possess anti-inflammatory properties. As a result of these anti-inflammatory properties, which aid in the blockage of L-selectin, sulfatide has been shown to prevent type I diabetes and inhibit insulitis in non-obese diabetic mice. Sulfatide also prevents apoptosis in insulin secreting cells by preventing the effects of interleukin-1 beta (lL-1β), <b>interferon</b> <b>beta</b> 1b (lFN-1β), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) that promote apoptosis.|$|E
500|$|Interferon beta-1a is {{injected}} either weekly (intramuscular injection) {{or three times}} a week (subcutaneous injection) depending on commercial formulations, while interferon beta-1b {{is injected}} subcutaneously every second day. In 2014, a pegylated form of interferon beta-1a was introduced with the brand name Plegridy, which is available as a subcutaneous injection. This peginterferon beta 1-a attaches polyethylene glycol to the interferon molecules allowing longer lasting biological effects in the body while decreasing the frequency of administration to once every two weeks. [...] <b>Interferon</b> <b>beta</b> balances the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory agents in the brain, and reduces the number of inflammatory cells that cross the blood–brain barrier.

500|$|Medications are {{modestly}} {{effective at}} decreasing {{the number of}} attacks in RRMS and in reducing the accumulation of brain lesions, which is measured using gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Interferons and glatiramer acetate are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30% and their safe profile make them the first-line treatments. Nevertheless, not all the patients are responsive to these therapies. It is known that 30% of MS patients are non-responsive to Beta interferon. [...] One of the factors related to non-respondance {{is the presence of}} high levels of <b>interferon</b> <b>beta</b> neutralizing [...] antibodies.

40|$|Bacterial {{lipopolysaccharide}} {{and some}} cytokines can activate macrophages to secrete nitric oxide. Macrophage-derived nitric oxide {{is a key}} cytotoxic factor for microbicidal and tumoricidal processes. We report here that a monoclonal antibody specific for <b>beta</b> <b>interferon</b> inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide production in thioglycolate-elicited C 3 HeB/FeJ peritoneal macrophages and macrophage-like cell line RAW 264. 7. In addition, exogenous added <b>beta</b> <b>interferon</b> enabled lipopolysaccharide-hyporesponsive thioglycolate-elicited C 3 H/HeJ peritoneal macrophages to produce nitric oxide in response to lipopolysaccharide. These data support the concept that <b>beta</b> <b>interferon</b> provides an essential signal(s) for lipopolysaccharide-triggered nitric oxide production by mouse macrophages. Heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive bacterium which was unable to initiate nitric oxide production in thioglycolate-elicited C 3 HeB/FeJ peritoneal macrophages in vitro, promoted nitric oxide formation {{in the presence of}} <b>beta</b> <b>interferon,</b> suggesting that <b>beta</b> <b>interferon</b> may be a general cofactor necessary for bacterium-derived stimulus-induced nitric oxide production in these macrophages. However, neither <b>beta</b> <b>interferon</b> nor tumor necrosis factor alpha, alone or in combination, triggered nitric oxide production in thioglycolate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages, demonstrating that these macrophage-derived cytokines, while necessary, were not sufficient by themselves for the induction of nitric oxide production in these cells. On the other hand, gamma interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha acted together to induce nitric oxide production in vitro in the absence of lipopolysaccharide in thioglycolate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages, indicating that these two types of interferons provided different signals during the activation of these macrophages...|$|R

2500|$|The innate {{immune system}} {{constitutes}} {{the first line of}} defense against invading pathogens and is regarded as the major initiator of inflammatory responses. [...] Its cellular component involves primarily monocyte/macrophages, granulocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs), which are activated upon sensing of conserved pathogen structures (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors ((TLRs)). MIR155HG (i.e. miR-155-5p) expression is greatly enhanced by TLR agonist stimulation of macrophages and dendritic cells. [...] Since microbial lipopolysaccharide (an agonist of TLR4) activates a chain of events that lead to the stimulation of the NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors, it was hypothesized that endotoxin activation of MIR155HG may be mediated by those transcription factors. [...] Indeed, MIR155HG expression was found to be activated in [...] LPS treated murine macrophage cells (i.e. Raw264.7) by an NF-κB-mediated mechanism. Furthermore, [...] H. pylori infection of primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages resulted in a NF-κB dependent up-regulation of MIR155HG. In the context of viral infection vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) challenge of murine peritoneal macrophages was reported to result in miR-155-5p over-expression via a retinoic acid-inducible gene I/JNK/NF-κB–dependent pathway. Support for a role of AP-1 in MIR155HG activation comes from studies using stimuli relevant to viral infection such as TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) or <b>interferon</b> <b>beta</b> (IFN-β). [...] Downstream of those stimuli AP-1 seems to play a major role in MIR155HG activation.|$|E

40|$|We showed {{previously}} {{that the}} mouse fibroblastoid cell line Ltk-aprt- is {{resistant to the}} antiviral effects of <b>beta</b> <b>interferon.</b> This lack of response reflects a partial sensitivity to the interferon that {{is accompanied by a}} failure to activate expression of several interferon-regulated genes, although certain other genes respond in a normal manner. We show here that Ltk-aprt- cells were also unable to establish an antiviral state and to activate expression of 2, 5 -oligo(A) synthetase when treated with gamma interferon. Strikingly, however, treatment with a combination of <b>beta</b> <b>interferon</b> and gamma interferon provided complete protection against viral replication. Although the cells were completely insensitive to up to 250 U of the interferons per ml added singly, essentially complete protection from viral cytopathic effects was achieved when as little as 10 U of each of the interferons per ml were combined. Expression of 2, 5 -oligo(A) synthetase was also sensitive to this synergistic effect. Activation of an antiviral state could also be achieved by sequential treatment, first with gamma interferon and then with <b>beta</b> <b>interferon.</b> Partial protection against viral replication could be achieved by pretreatment with gamma interferon for as little as 1 h before incubation with <b>beta</b> <b>interferon</b> and could be blocked by the addition of specific antibodies or by cycloheximide, indicating that gamma interferon induces the synthesis of a protein which can act synergistically with a signal produced by the beta-interferon receptor. We suggest that Ltk-aprt- cells suffer from defects in one or more components of the gene activation pathways for both type I and type II interferons. Nonetheless, gamma interferon is able to activate the expression of a gene encoding a protein required for signal transduction. This protein acts synergistically with a transient signal produced in response to <b>beta</b> <b>interferon,</b> thereby activating the expression of a further group of genes...|$|R

40|$|Expression of c-fos mRNA was {{investigated}} in fresh, normal peritoneal macrophages (M phi), which are terminally differentiated, nonproliferating cells. The levels of c-fos mRNA were dramatically increased by stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), calcium ionophore, or 1 -oleoyl- 2 -acetoyl glycerol (OAG). Induction of c-fos mRNA by all the above agents followed similar kinetics, with a peak of mRNA 30 min after stimulation. These results demonstrate that c-fos mRNA can be augmented in fresh, terminally differentiated cells. Since the stimuli increasing c-fos mRNA are direct or indirect activators of protein kinase C, our data suggest that in M phi c-fos mRNA is controlled by protein kinase C activation. PMA, calcium ionophore, and OAG were biologically active in M phi. PMA and calcium ionophore induced respiratory burst and tumoricidal activity, respectively, whereas OAG and PMA were chemotactic for M phi. <b>Interferons</b> <b>beta</b> and gamma, potent M phi activators eliciting tumoricidal activity, did not alter the levels of c-fos mRNA.
