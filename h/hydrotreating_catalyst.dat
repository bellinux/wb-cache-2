In classical catalytic hydrotreatment applications, there are particular catalysts designed and developed to operate for different feedstock types, i.e., with different characteristics and for different process targets, for example, maximizing diesel yield, maximizing gasoline yield, or for isomerization. As a result, there was significant effort towards assessing commercial catalysts (Bezergianni et al. 2012) that could potentially be utilized for such application. After a series of dedicated experiments, the best <b>hydrotreating</b> <b>catalyst</b> was selected based on its effectiveness in maximizing diesel yield (desired product) while maintaining its quality. Secondly, the operating parameters of hydrotreating WCO (reaction temperature, pressure, liquid hourly space velocity, and hydrogen-to-WCO ratio) had to be optimized.

40|$|Metal {{phosphide}} {{has been}} widely investigated as a <b>hydrotreating</b> <b>catalyst.</b> The preparation and performance of noble metal phosphide catalyst was examined to develop new phosphide hydrotreating catalysts. The supports affect reducibility of phosphate as a P precursor. Since phosphate does not strongly interact with SiO 2 and TiO 2 supports, Rh 2 P was easily formed on these supports. Furthermore, formation of Rh 2 P enhanced the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity of supported Rh–P catalyst. The type of noble metal (NM) and P/NM ratio also strongly affect formation of noble metal phosphide and HDS activity. Excess P facilitates formation of noble metal phosphides at lower reduction temperature. In contrast, excess P causes the aggregation of noble metal phosphide and formation of phosphorus rich noble metal phosphide. Rh– 1. 5 P/SiO 2 catalyst had high and stable activity for HDS reaction. Furthermore, this catalyst showed significantly higher hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) activity than sulfided NiMoP/Al 2 O 3 catalyst.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} meet the demand for cleaner fuels, it is {{necessary}} to develop high performing <b>hydrotreating</b> <b>catalysts.</b> Although organic additives are often used to improve the performances of <b>hydrotreating</b> <b>catalysts,</b> bio-polymer additives have not yet been thoroughly investigated. We recently showed that dopamine, a neurotransmitter molecule, which is also frequently found in adhesive bio-polymers, efficiently coats the surface of an alumina carrier material and modifies the interaction with active components of <b>hydrotreating</b> <b>catalysts,</b> i. e. cobalt and molybdenum. The catalytic performance of the CoMoS/Al 2 O 3 catalysts could, thus, be improved. In the present paper we extend the strategy to other carrier materials (silica and titania). The catalysts prepared on (poly) dopamine (Pdop) coated silica showed enhanced activity for the hydrogenation of toluene reaction and the selective HDS of FCC gasoline model feed. Pdop coating lowers the MoS 2 nanocrystallites' stacking on silica, thereby improving the accessibility of active edge sites. The origin of this increase in catalytic activity may be found in the higher capacity of Pdop's functional groups to interact with metallic precursors leading to a better dispersion of the active phase. On the contrary, when the interaction between the dopamine and the support is too strong (as observed for TiO 2), the functional groups of Pdop are not available for interaction with Co and Mo species, resulting in decreased catalytic activity...|$|R

Recently, SBA- 15, which is an ordered mesoporous silica support, has received importance as a catalyst support because of its excellent textural properties. However, SBA- 15 lacks surface acidity and provides very low metal-support interaction. By modifying SBA- 15 with zirconia, an optimum level of surface acidity and Si-Mo interaction can be achieved. Also, by doping zirconia with SBA- 15, the textural properties of zirconia can be improved. Hence, a synergistic effect can be obtained while incorporating zirconia onto SBA- 15 and the resulting material Zr-SBA- 15 can be used as an effective support for <b>hydrotreating</b> <b>catalyst.</b> In the present study, Zr-SBA- 15 supports were prepared by the post synthesis and the direct synthesis method with different zirconia loading. Zr-SBA- 15 supported NiMo catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation technique. Catalysts and supports were characterized by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), nitrogen adsorption/desorption (BET), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Raman spectroscopy methods. Characterization of support confirmed that the zirconia was successfully incorporated in a mesoporous SBA- 15 structure without significantly changing the textural properties of SBA- 15. The performance of the Zr-SBA- 15 supported NiMo catalysts was evaluated based on hydrodesulfurization and hydrodenitrogenation activities exhibited during hydrotreating of heavy gas oil derived from Athabasca bitumen at industrial operating condition (temperature 375 - 395 °C, pressure 8. 9 MPa, LHSV 1. 0 hr- 1 and gas/oil ratio 600 Nm 3 /m 3). The comparison of catalytic activities showed that the NiMo catalysts supported on Zr-SBA- 15, prepared by direct and post synthesis method exhibited higher hydrotreating activity compared to SBA- 15 supported catalyst. NiMo catalyst supported on Zr-SBA- 15 with 23 wt% of ZrO 2 loading, prepared by post synthesis method showed the highest activity among all the catalysts. After determining the best support, the optimum catalyst metal loadings on the Zr-SBA- 15 support was found to be 17 wt% of Mo and 3. 4 wt% of Ni. This catalyst also showed higher activity in mass basis for the hydrotreating of heavy gas oil compared to that of commercial <b>hydrotreating</b> <b>catalyst.</b> A kinetic study was performed on the optimum NiMo/Zr-SBA- 15 catalyst to predict its HDS and HDN activities while varying the parameters of temperature, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV), pressure and gas-to-oil ratio.

Hydrotreating and hydrocracking catalysts are used to improve the yield of high-quality light oil fractions from heavier crude oil and petroleum feedstocks containing high levels of impurities. FCC catalysts improve the yield of higher octane gasoline from crude oil. Residuum hydrotreating and cracking catalysts are susceptible to irreversible deactivation caused by adsorption of sulfur and by metals impurities, such as vanadium and nickel. The gradual buildup of these impurities in a <b>hydrotreating</b> <b>catalyst</b> eventually plugs the pores and deactivates it. Nickel and vanadium adversely affect the behavior of cracking catalysts, reducing product yield and quality. Replacing deactivated catalysts represents a significant cost in petroleum refining. Equally important are the costs and potential liabilities associated with treating and disposing spent catalysts.

FCC catalysts, though more easily disposed of as road-base or as filler in asphalt and cement, are still an economic concern {{mainly because of the}} large volumes of spent catalysts generated.

The range of studied concentrations corresponds to cluster formation domain. The results evidence that coal asphaltenes aggregates are smaller, have lower molecular weight and exhibit a much higher diffusion coefficient than petroleum asphaltene aggregates. These results bring important insights for the interpretation of the performance of the catalysts during coal-derived liquid upgrading. Concerning adsorption phenomena, the adsorption constants of coal asphaltenes and petroleum asphaltenes have been found equivalent. The adsorption saturation concentration of coal asphaltenes is higher than that of petroleum asphaltenes. The effective diffusion coefficients obtained at ambient temperature were correlated to the catalytic performances observed during coal-derived liquid hydrotreatment.

In the study of transient deactivation, initial activity of the catalyst was derived by a time variable function, then this equation was used in dynamic model of hydrodesulfurization reaction in a packed bed reactor to determine the activity change of the catalyst in the reactor during actual operational conditions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLarge {{quantities}} of catalysts {{are used in}} the Egyptian refining industry for the purification and upgrading of various petroleum streams. These catalysts gradually lose activity through deactivation with time and the spent catalysts were usually discarded as solid waste. On the other hand, waste lube oil contains heavy metals coming from undergirded base oil and additives, these metals have carcinogenic effect and cause serious environmental problems. Studies are conducted on the reclamation of metals, rejuvenation and reuse of the spent <b>hydrotreating</b> <b>catalyst</b> (Mo–Ni/Al) which have been used in re-refining of waste lube oil at Alexandria Petroleum Company. Three leaching solvents were used: oxidized oxalic acid, benzoic acid and boric acid at different concentrations (4 %, 8 % and 16 %), different oxidizing agents (H 2 O 2 and Fe(NO 3) 3) and different modes of addition of oxidizing agents (batch and continuous). The results indicated that 4 % oxalic acid+ 5 % Fe(NO 3) 3 at continuous addition of oxidizing agents was the most efficient leaching solvent to facilitate metal removal and rejuvenate catalyst. The fresh catalyst was applied for re-refining of waste lube oil under different reaction temperatures (320 – 410) °C in order to compare the hydrodesulphurization (HDS) activity with both the fresh, treated and spent catalysts. The results indicated that the rejuvenation techniques introduce a catalyst have HDS activity nearly approach to that the fresh of the same type...|$|E

The surface of the catalytically stabilized MoS 2 has been shown to be carbided with the formula MoSxCy under hydrotreating conditions. In this paper we review the basis for this finding and present new data extending the concept to the promoted TMS (transition metal sulfides) systems CoMoC and NiMoC. Freshly sulfided CoMoS and NiMoS catalyst have a strong tendency to form the carbided surface phases from any available carbon source...|$|R

It appeared that the their performance in the hydrodesulphurisation of dibenzothiophene and thiophene strongly depends on their sulphiding degree, which can be controlled by both the calcining and sulphiding temperature. By combining temperature programmed sulphiding with quasi in-situ XPS and activity measurements, {{it was concluded that}} the active phase for the HDS of DBT consist of either micro-crystalline sulphided Ni on a WO 3 substrate, or of Ni 2 + dissolved in the in NiWO 4. In contrast, the active phase for the HDS of thiophene seems to consist of Ni-promoted WS 2 structures...|$|R
40|$|The global {{petroleum}} {{demand is}} projected to increase in the next decennia as oil is expected to remain {{the primary source of}} energy around the globe contributing to approximately 40 % of the total consumption. The production of high-quality fuels from crude oil involves physical separation steps but also catalytic processes to remove contaminants (hydrotreating), shift the boiling point (alkylation and hydrocracking) and increase fuel quality (isomerisation). In hydrotreating sulfur, nitrogen, oxygen and metal atoms are removed from the different petroleum streams and unsaturated hydrocarbons are hydrogenated. The main reasons for refineries to perform hydrotreating are of environmental and economic nature. Besides protection of downstream catalysts from poisoning by sulfur, stringent environmental legislation has been aimed at the reduction of sulfur oxide emissions from fuel combustion. The environmental regulations on transportation fuel quality and the diminishing supplies of lighter types of crude oil necessitate further improvement of hydrotreating processes. An important approach is then to further optimize the catalytic activity of <b>hydrotreating</b> <b>catalysts.</b> In spite of the substantial progress made in the fundamental understanding of the active phase morphology, the metal-support interaction and reaction mechanisms, many details about the nature and stability of the active sites have not yet been elucidated. One specific issue not widely addressed is the influence of the sulfidation pressure on the active phase in <b>hydrotreating</b> <b>catalysts.</b> In industrial practice, catalysts are brought in their active, sulfided form at elevated pressure. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to understand the effect of the sulfidation pressure on the active phase structure in CoMo and NiW catalyst...|$|R
