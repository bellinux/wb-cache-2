40|$|Multiple ‘green transformations’ are {{required}} if humanity {{is to live}} sustainably on planet Earth. Recalling past transformations, this book examines what makes the current challenge different, and especially urgent. It examines how <b>green</b> <b>transformations</b> must {{take place in the}} context of the particular moments of capitalist development, and in relation to particular alliances. The role of the state is emphasised, both in terms of the type of incentives required to make <b>green</b> <b>transformations</b> politically feasible and the way states must take a developmental role in financing innovation and technology for <b>green</b> <b>transformations.</b> The book also highlights the role of citizens, as innovators, entrepreneurs, green consumers and members of social movements. <b>Green</b> <b>transformations</b> must be both ‘top-down’, involving elite alliances between states and business, but also ‘bottom up’, pushed by grassroots innovators and entrepreneurs, and part of wider mobilisations among civil society.

It outlines the ‘entrepreneurial state’ approach, as outlined by Mariana Mazzucato as a promising conceptual approach with potentially transformative policy implications to address the issues of innovation. It identifies {{some of the}} political challenges to achieving entrepreneurial state-type institutions in contexts where configurations of power and existing actor networks are unfavourable. It argues that although entrepreneurial state-type institutions are often framed as operating by harnessing high degrees of cooperation between different actors according to commonly-held long-term objectives, achieving the right types of institutions is likely to require a high degree of contestation in order to overcome existing vested interests. Moreover, it discusses the relationship between <b>green</b> <b>transformations</b> and democratic participation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{looks at}} system {{innovation}} {{as a complex}} system. It dynamically evaluates the regional <b>green</b> <b>transformation</b> capacity through data envelopment analysis (DEA).

40|$|Environmental {{sustainability}} creates both tremendous {{business opportunities}} and formidable threats to established companies across virtually all industry sectors. Yet many companies tackle {{the issue in}} a superficial or passive way through increased environmental reporting, the use of “greenspeak” in their corporate communication activities or isolated efforts to create green products or reduce pollution. In contrast, there are a small but increasing number of firms that employ a holistic approach to sustainability and consider fundamental changes to their existing business models. By ignoring the opportunities of <b>Green</b> Business Model <b>Transformations,</b> companies exclude themselves from a large variety of potential means to create economic value. In addition to ordinary product and process innovations, they can change “the rules of the game” within an industry towards environmental sustainability. This can facilitate the commercialisation of new green products {{that would not be}} competitive otherwise targeting new customer segments with previously unmet needs improved economics of value creation by developing a green architecture of the firm and its business network <b>Green</b> Business Model <b>Transformations,</b> however, are challenging ventures in many respects: Firstly, it is difficult to develop and accurately assess the prospects of new, green business models due to uncertainties and inherent complex systemic characteristics.

40|$|Deep cuts {{in carbon}} {{emissions}} to avoid dangerous climatic change will require fundamental transformations {{of the energy}} and transport systems. This is an enormous challenge for society and the political system. In order to tackle this challenge, we argue {{that it will be}} necessary to develop new institutions and institutional practices that address and give priority to long-term climate policy objectives. In this paper we focus on three institutional innovations in the field of climate governance and energy system transformations that are guided by such visions. Institutional reforms at the national level in three arguably progressive cases (the Netherlands, the UK and Sweden) are studied concerning their relevance for governing transitions towards low-carbon societies. The study asks: What views on how to bring about low-carbon transitions guide the activities of the institution? What is the role of new institutions in processes of change and what institutional practices have developed so far? The cases provide examples of ways to enhance reflexivity and how a new political agenda for low-carbon futures and strategies for instigating processes of change can be institutionalized. However, when contrasted against contemporary green political thought, they seem to be bound by liberal conceptions of greening the welfare state rather than post-liberal ecologist ideals on radical <b>green</b> <b>transformations.</b> Our analysis also shows that in practice, the institutions examined tend to favor technological transitions over behavioral change and to be reliant on hierarchical authority and traditional patterns of steering to a greater extent than intended...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{continues}} to emerge that green buildings achieve higher financial performance than conventional buildings (referred {{to as the}} green premium in literature). This green premium has been promoted as a potential driver of development of new green buildings {{as well as the}} <b>green</b> <b>transformation</b> of the existing office property stock. While the validity of this claim is still a subject of an ongoing debate, the office property market is highly susceptible to a range of local factors which could overshadow or undermine the power of such a premium in this regard. Adopting a case study approach, this study examines the local market forces influencing the office stock greening process in three British cities. Data was obtained through semi-structured one-to-one interviews and analysis of relevant documentary evidence. A total of twenty-five commercial real estate professionals were interviewed across the three cities, namely London, Manchester and Edinburgh. The results of the analysis show that office stock greening process differs among the cities and each market is influenced by distinct local factors. Findings suggest that while green premium may have the prospect of driving the <b>green</b> <b>transformation</b> of city offices, its impact is still largely muddled by the prevailing local market factors...|$|E

40|$|The {{future of}} human life on our planet is {{influenced}} increasingly by {{what goes on in}} the rising powers. This report presents a political economy analysis of their policies, comparing China, India, Brazil and South Africa. The importance of these countries for global climate deals is undisputed. What is less clear is the domestic politics behind their global positioning. Who drives – or obstructs – the adoption of climate-relevant policies in their own countries? This report analyses the question by focusing on renewable energy policies. The political economy approach adopted in the report rests on four critical steps: 1. Recognising that no single actor has the political and financial resources to bring about the required transformations; 2. Recognising that in government, civil society and business actors seek to drive or block these transformations; 3. The need to focus attention on alliances across these categories; and 4. Including actors with different motives helps to understand and accelerate transformations. This approach is used to unravel and compare what goes on in China, India, Brazil and South Africa. The methodological challenge lies in cutting through complexity, especially if changes over time are considered. Alliances and narratives keep changing. The overall message is that rapid political economy analysis is possible and a focus on alliances provides much needed hope that <b>green</b> <b>transformations</b> can be accelerated.
