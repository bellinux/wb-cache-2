25|$|<b>Knowing</b> {{the meaning}} of a lexical item {{therefore}} means <b>knowing</b> the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of a semantic field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words rose and rabbit without <b>knowing</b> what a marigold or a muskrat is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word red without <b>knowing</b> {{the meaning of}} scarlet, but understanding scarlet without <b>knowing</b> the meaning of red may be less likely. A semantic field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like German shepherd, would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. corgi, or poodle), thus expanding the semantic field further.|$|E
