The audience saw Fox step out of character - that of French statesman Charles de Gaulle - and chastise the heckler with robust language.|$|E
5|$|Nevin's {{intensity}} {{almost got}} the best of him during a June 1993 game with Tucson. He was taunted by a man seated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row,</b> and nearly attempted to jump into the stands to confront the fan before he was restrained by teammates. The fan was arrested.|$|E
5|$|Members {{are able}} to sit {{anywhere}} in the debating chamber, but typically sit in their party groupings. The First Minister, Scottish cabinet ministers and Law officers sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row,</b> in the middle section of the chamber. The largest party in the Parliament sits {{in the middle of}} the semicircle, with opposing parties on either side. The Presiding Officer, parliamentary clerks and officials sit opposite members at the front of the debating chamber.|$|E

25|$|The green room, {{where the}} artists rested after their performances, was altered from {{previous}} contests.

5|$|While the {{surgeons}} {{working on the}} body are observed by the mortar-boarded academics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row,</b> the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves. The president {{has been identified as}} John Freke, president of the Royal College of Surgeons at the time. Freke had been involved in the high-profile attempt to secure the body of condemned rioter Bosavern Penlez for dissection in 1749.|$|E
5|$|Growing up {{as part of}} a lucha libre {{family the}} future Espanto Jr. decided he wanted to follow in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather at an early age. In a 2010 interview he recalled how he would be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row</b> watching his father wrestle from the time he could walk. In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that it was an accident and tried not to think about it, but did comment that his mother still worried about him every time he competed.|$|E
5|$|In early 1955 Hordern {{was asked}} by the British theatre manager and {{producer}} Binkie Beaumont {{to take the lead in}} André Roussin's comedy Nina, directed by Rex Harrison. The play, which starred Edith Evans, Lockwood West, and James Hayter, transferred from Oxford to the Theatre Royal in Brighton. Beaumont's request came at short notice because Hordern's predecessor had proved inadequate. The play was cursed with bad luck: Evans fell ill and was replaced midway by an understudy who neglected to learn her lines; Harrison frequently upset the cast, which resulted in reduced morale. When Evans did return, she walked off stage and left after seeing empty seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2007, she {{attended}} the national funeral service for Gerald Ford in the Washington National Cathedral. Reagan hosted two 2008 Republican presidential debates at the Reagan Presidential Library, {{the first in}} May 2007 and the second in January 2008. While she {{did not participate in}} the discussions, she sat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row</b> and listened as the men vying to become the nation's 44th president claimed to be a rightful successor to her husband. Though some speculation arose as to whether Reagan might support New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a presidential bid, nothing came of it. On March 25, she formally endorsed Senator John McCain, then the presumptive Republican party nominee for president, but McCain would go on to lose the election to Barack Obama.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{had trouble}} with the censors over several segments in this episode. The opening segment of the episode, which features a Fox censor named Fox Censor (pictured on the left) being stabbed to death, was pitched by David Mirkin and {{had a difficult time}} getting through the real-life censors. They had issues with the size of the knife and the sound effects used. Originally, the TV-rating was supposed to stab Censor with a dagger, but Fox objected because it was too gruesome and was changed to a cutlass. The censors also objected to an unaired scene where Homer does his naked church dance on an altar. The scene was reanimated so that Homer was dancing naked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row.</b>|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Häkkinen clinched his fifth pole position of the season and his third at the circuit, with a time of 1:50.646; although he was optimistic about his race prospects, he was concerned about the start. Häkkinen was joined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row</b> of the grid by Trulli, who equalled his best qualifying performance of the season (at the Monaco Grand Prix). Trulli was also optimistic about his chances because of the Jordan team's strong record at the circuit. Button qualified third, and said he was happy with his starting position. Michael Schumacher secured fourth position, nine-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen, setting a lap time which pushed Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard into fifth. Coulthard, who had problems with grip, believed that he could have had a faster lap time. Ralf Schumacher secured sixth position after being caught in traffic during his final run, keeping the Williams driver from a quicker lap time. Villeneuve, in seventh, reported oversteering. Frentzen qualified eighth; his best lap time was disqualified after Coulthard blocked him at the Bus Stop chicane, which caused Frentzen to run onto the grass. Herbert and Barrichello rounded out the top ten drivers, with Barrichello spinning at the chicane during his third run after locking his brakes. Fisichella, eleventh, missed the top ten by three-tenths of a second on his only quick run of the session. Herbert's teammate, Eddie Irvine, qualified twelfth with tyre-grip problems. He was ahead of Zonta in the slower of the two BARs (which lost a half-second through Eau Rouge), Heidfeld in the faster Prost, Sauber's Pedro Diniz and Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa. Alesi qualified 17th, despite spinning at the chicane and triggering a yellow flag. Salo qualified 18th, ahead of Wurz (who had engine problems and shared the spare Benetton monocoque with Fisichella). Verstappen and the two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the back of the}} grid, in positions 20 to 22.|$|E
50|$|Being a {{prototype}} stadium, McDiarmid Park has some faults that critics of seated stadia picked upon. Spectators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> of <b>the</b> stands {{are not necessarily}} sheltered, while the stadium has been criticised for lacking atmosphere. St Johnstone are routinely praised for their pricing structure especially for visiting families sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ormond/Family stand.|$|R

500|$|The character's {{transformation}} into a vampire, and the visceral nature this trait lends the series, {{was derived from}} William Shakespeare's classical models: [...] "for <b>the</b> drunken commoners <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> he would insert dirty jokes to keep them entertained but for <b>the</b> aristocracy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> balconies he would write very cerebral metaphors". According to Silicon Knights, the gore and vampirism in Blood Omen served as their [...] "dirty jokes", supplemented by a complex story.|$|R

50|$|The show {{began with}} a castmember reciting an opening spiel {{regarding}} {{the nature of the}} show : “Today, {{you are going to see}} a movie on the history of cinema spanning from silent films to today's modern films.” The movie started playing a montage of early black-and-white films. After a few moments, a cell phone ring was heard, and a man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> answered it. He eluded the castmember and walked on the stage while talking.|$|R

According to Human Rights Watch, {{the government}} then sealed off the perimeter of the protest and opened fire. Some reports indicate indiscriminate firing by government troops, including the use of snipers, automatic rifles, and armoured personnel carriers. It is unclear whether Karimov personally ordered the attack.|$|E

50|$|Each package {{differed}} somewhat as {{to which}} effects were included, and the specific application of each, however, there were many similarities, driven by moments built into the film.

Simultaneously, one or more large water cannons are discharged from below the screen, sending a water spray out into the audience. <b>The</b> guests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> were often soaked.|$|R
