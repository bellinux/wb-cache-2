5|$|Tech punted, and Stanford's offense {{returned}} to the field. The two teams traded possessions one more time, with Stanford turning the ball over on downs after a failed fourth-down conversion attempt, and Virginia Tech returning the ball with another punt.

Two plays gained fiveyards, then Luck completed a 21-yard pass to wide receiver Doug Baldwin <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> second first down of the game.

5|$|The {{sequence}} in which multiple Alien Bounty Hunters appear involved {{the use of}} motion control, a method in which a motion-control camera on a computerized module is repeatedly run through the same motion while elements are continually added. The shot, according to John Wash, {{was one of the}} few times in the series in which the production crew was able to use motion control and therefore presented a slight challenge. In the filming of the sequence, both a blank plate, <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> set, and lighting elements, that were in the set, were shot before the production crew filmed five different passes, each one with the Alien Bounty Hunter in a different position. The production crew were finally able to clone the Bounty Hunter by blending all the passes together.|$|E

25|$|Otherwise, Ford's {{works are}} {{characterized}} by an aversion to doing {{things that have been}} done before. This is perhaps most notable in his two Star Trek novels, The Final Reflection (1984) and How Much <b>for</b> <b>Just</b> <b>the</b> Planet? (1987). The Final Reflection {{is the story of a}} small group of Klingons who prevent a war between the Klingon Empire and the Federation while the regular series characters are relegated to cameo appearances. (This novel introduced the fictional language Klingonaase.) In the comedic How Much <b>for</b> <b>Just</b> <b>the</b> Planet?, the Enterprise crew compete with a Klingon crew for control of a planet, whose colonists are not happy with this and defend their peace in inventive ways, which soon make everything a farce, including a Vaudevillian pie fight. The book includes song lyrics that satirize many 20th century stage musicals. Both novels present the Klingons in a more positive light, not just as the token evil menace of the week.|$|E
