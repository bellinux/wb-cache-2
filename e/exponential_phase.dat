5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is the lag phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. The lag phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or <b>exponential</b> <b>phase.</b> The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E

In this investigation, laser tweezers Raman spectroscopy (LTRS) was used to characterize dynamic changes in PHB content—as well as in the contents of other common biomolecule—in C. necator during batch growth at both the population and single-cell levels. PHB accumulation began {{in the early stages of}} bacterial growth, and the maximum PHB production rate occurred in the early and middle <b>exponential</b> <b>phases.</b> The active biosynthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins occurred in the lag and early <b>exponential</b> <b>phases,</b> whereas the levels of these molecules decreased continuously during the remaining fermentation process until the minimum values were reached.

5000|$|The {{production}} of ROS {{has also been}} shown to be dependent on algal cell density.

[...] Tang & Gobler also found that cell density was inversely related to ROS production for the alga Cochlodinium polykrikoides. They found, in addition, that increases of ROS production were also related to the growth phase of algae. In particular, algae in exponential growth were more toxic than those in the stationary or late <b>exponential</b> <b>phase.</b> Many other algal species (Heterosigma akashiwo, Chattonella marina, and Chattonella antiqua) have also been shown to produce the highest amounts of ROS during the <b>exponential</b> <b>phase</b> of growth.

5000|$|When a {{particular}} organism is introduced into a selected growth medium, the medium is inoculated with the particular organism. Growth of the inoculum {{does not occur}} immediately, but takes a little while. This is the period of adaptation, called the lag phase. [...] Following the lag phase, {{the rate of growth}} of the organism steadily increases, for a certain period—this period is the log or <b>exponential</b> <b>phase.</b> [...] After a certain time of <b>exponential</b> <b>phase,</b> the rate of growth slows down, due to the continuously falling concentrations of nutrients and/or a continuously increasing (accumulating) concentrations of toxic substances. This phase, where the increase of the rate of growth is checked, is the deceleration phase. After the deceleration phase, growth ceases and the culture enters a stationary phase or a steady state. The biomass remains constant, except when certain accumulated chemicals in the culture lyse the cells (chemolysis). Unless other micro-organisms contaminate the culture, the chemical constitution remains unchanged. If all of the nutrients in the medium are consumed, or if the concentration of toxins is too great, the cells may become scenescent and begin to die off. The total amount of biomass may not decrease, but the number of viable organisms will decrease.|$|E

5000|$|Transcription of rpoS in E. coli {{is mainly}} {{regulated}} by the chromosomal rpoSp promoter. [...] rpoSp promotes transcription of rpoS mRNA, and is induced upon entry into stationary phase in cells growing on rich media via an unknown mechanism. [...] Flanking rpoSp are two putative cAMP-CRP (cyclic AMP-cAMP receptor protein) binding sites that seem to control rpoS transcription in an antagonistic manner. The position of the first site upstream of the major rpoS promoter corresponds to a “classical activator” similarly found in the lac promoter thereby suggesting that its effects on transcription are activating (Lange and Hengge-Aronis, 1994); in contrast, {{the location of the}} second cAMP-CRP site is indicative of inhibitory action. In <b>exponential</b> <b>phase,</b> crp mutants exhibit high levels of rpoS expression, suggesting that cAMP-CRP inhibits rpoS transcription. Upon entry into stationary phase, on the other hand, cAMP-CRP may upregulate rpoS transcription (Hengge-Aronis, 2002). While these observations may explain the seemingly dual nature of the cAMP-CRP binding sites, they require an explanation of phase-dependent selection of cAMP-CRP site activation to fully account for the contradictory data. Additional regulatory controls for rpoS transcription include: BarA, a Histidine sensor kinase which can activate OmpR and thereby promote porin synthesis; levels of small molecules such as ppGppp which may hinder transcriptional elongation or stability in response to amino acid limitation, or carbon, nitrogen or phosphorus starvation (Gentry et al., 1993).
