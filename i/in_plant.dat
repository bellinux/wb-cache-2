5|$|Botanical {{gardens are}} often run by {{universities}} or other scientific research organizations, and often have associated herbaria and research programmes <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> taxonomy {{or some other}} aspect of botanical science. In principle, their role is to maintain documented collections of living plants {{for the purposes of}} scientific research, conservation, display, and education, although this will depend on the resources available and the special interests pursued at each particular garden.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids {{are made}} by fatty acid synthases that {{polymerize}} and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups: in animals and fungi, all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein, while <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> plastids and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway.|$|E

40|$|Bax, a death-promoting {{member of}} the Bcl- 2 family of proteins, {{triggered}} cell death when expressed <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> from a tobacco mosaic virus vector. Analysis of Bax deletion mutants demonstrated a requirement for the BH 1 and BH 3 domains in promoting rapid cell death, whereas deletion of the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domain completely abolished the lethality of Bax <b>in</b> <b>plants.</b> The phenotype of cell death induced by Bax closely resembled the hypersensitive response induced by wild-type tobacco mosaic virus <b>in</b> tobacco <b>plants</b> carrying the N gene. The cell death-promoting function of Bax <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> correlated with accumulation of the defense-related protein PR 1, suggesting Bax activated an endogenous cell-death program <b>in</b> <b>plants.</b> <b>In</b> support of this view, both N gene- and Bax-mediated cell death was blocked by okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase activity. The ability of Bax to induce cell death and a defense reaction <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> suggests that some features of animal and plant cell death processes may be shared...|$|R
5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> phyllotaxis.|$|E
5|$|In Europe the Renaissance of the 14th17th centuries heralded a {{scientific}} revival during which botany gradually emerged from natural history {{as an independent}} science, distinct from medicine and agriculture. Herbals were replaced by floras: books that described the native plants of local regions. The invention of the microscope stimulated the study of plant anatomy, and the first carefully designed experiments <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> physiology were performed. With the expansion of trade and exploration beyond Europe, the many new plants being discovered were subjected to an increasingly rigorous process of naming, description, and classification.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to rich dinosaur fossils, {{there are also}} plant fossils that illustrate the reduction <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> species across the K–Pg boundary. In the sediments below the K–Pg boundary the dominant plant remains are angiosperm pollen grains, but the boundary layer contains little pollen and is dominated by fern spores. More usual pollen levels gradually resume above the boundary layer. This is reminiscent of areas blighted by modern volcanic eruptions, where the recovery is led by ferns, which are later replaced by larger angiosperm plants.|$|E

40|$|Expression of viral genes <b>in</b> {{transgenic}} <b>plants</b> is a {{very effective}} tool for attenuating plant viral infection. Nevertheless, the lack of generality and risk {{issues related to the}} expression of viral genes <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> might limit the exploitation of this strategy. Expression <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> of antibodies against essential viral proteins could provide an alternative approach to engineer viral resistance. Recently, expression of complete or engineered antibodies has been successfully achieved <b>in</b> <b>plants.</b> The engineered single-chain Fv antibody scFv (refs 10, 11) is particularly suitable for expression <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> because of its small size and the lack of assembly requirements. Here we present evidence that constitutive expression <b>in</b> transgenic <b>plants</b> of a scFv antibody, directed against the plant icosahedral tombusvirus artichoke mottled crinkle virus, causes reduction of infection incidence and delay in symptom development...|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to this increasing competition, natural ice companies examined various options. Some invested <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> ice themselves. New tools were brought in {{to speed up the}} harvesting of ice, but these efficiency improvements were outstripped by technical advances <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> ice manufacture. The Natural Ice Association of America was formed to promote the benefits of natural ice, and companies played on the erroneous belief amongst customers that natural ice melted less slowly than manufactured ice. Under pressure, some ice companies attempted to exploit their local monopolies on ice distribution networks to artificially raise prices for urban customers. One of the most prominent cases of this involved Charles Morse and his American Ice Company, which suddenly almost tripled wholesale and doubled the retail prices in New York in 1900 {{in the midst of a}} heat wave; this created a scandal that caused Morse to sell up his assets in the ice trade altogether to escape prosecution, making a profit of $12 million ($320 million) in the process.|$|E
5|$|Many other botanists echoed Lindley's earlier {{concerns}} about the phylogeny of the Liliaceae, but various schemes to divide the family gained little traction. Dahlgren (1985) suggested there were in fact forty – not one – families distributed over three orders (predominantly Liliales and Asparagales). In {{the context of a}} general review of the classification of angiosperms, the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny. Considerable progress <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> phylogeny and phylogenetic theory enabled a phylogenetic tree to be constructed for all of the flowering plants, as elaborated by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (1998).|$|E
5|$|Mycena inclinata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, deriving its {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter found <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> litter such as leaves, twigs, bark and branches.

40|$|Summary. Chemical {{substances}} that play {{essential role in}} neurotransmission in animals, such as acetylcholine and biogenic monoamines (e. g. dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, serotonin) have also been demonstrated <b>in</b> <b>plants.</b> Acetylcholine and catecholamines are believed to act as deterrents to insect predators and foraging animals but data about their possible role as biomediators <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> are accumulating. Acetylcholine is probably involved in regulation of physiological processes <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> as germination, flowering, morphogenesis and especially <b>in</b> phytochrome-controlled <b>plant</b> growth and development. Biogenic monoamines {{have been shown to}} modulate morphogenesis and reproductive organogenesis, {{to play a role in}} adaptation of some plants to a changing environment. Dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline were shown to participate in intercellular regulation of ion permeability and photophosphorylation of chloroplasts. Hydrophylic animal neurotransmitter substances are suitable candidates for signalling molecules <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> but their acceptance as biomediators <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> needs much more experimental information...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{overview}} of vaccine antigens against malaria produced <b>in</b> <b>plants.</b> Plant-based expression systems represent an interesting production platform due to their reduced manufacturing costs and high scalability.

5|$|Palaeobotanists study ancient {{plants in}} the fossil record to provide {{information}} about the evolutionary history of plants. Cyanobacteria, the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, are thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria, changing the ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.|$|E

50|$|Pyridine {{alkaloids}} are a {{class of}} alkaloids, nitrogen-containing chemical compounds widely found <b>in</b> <b>plants,</b> that contain a pyridine ring. Examples include nicotine and anabasine which are found <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> of the genus Nicotiana including tobacco.|$|R
50|$|Genetics {{are more}} {{variable}} and malleable <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> than <b>in</b> animals, probably reflecting the higher activity level in animals. Hybrids genetics will necessarily be less stable {{than those of}} species evolving through isolation, which explains why hybrid species appear more common <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> than <b>in</b> animals. Many agricultural crops are hybrids with double or even triple chromosome sets. Having multiple sets of chromosomes is called polyploidy (or polyploidity). Polyploidy is usually fatal in animals where extra chromosome sets upset fetal development, but is often found <b>in</b> <b>plants.</b> A form of hybrid speciation that is relatively common <b>in</b> <b>plants,</b> occurs when an infertile hybrid becomes fertile after doubling of the chromosome number.|$|R
5|$|Significant discoveries {{relating}} to nitrogen assimilation and metabolism, including ammonification, nitrification and nitrogen fixation (the uptake of atmospheric nitrogen by symbiotic soil microorganisms) {{had to wait}} for advances in chemistry and bacteriology in the late 19th century and this was followed in the early 20th century by the elucidation of protein and amino-acid synthesis and their role <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> metabolism.

5|$|The Cretaceous period saw the {{appearance}} of more plant defense mechanisms. The diversification of flowering plants (angiosperms) at that time {{is associated with the}} sudden burst of speciation in insects. This diversification of insects represented a major selective force <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> evolution, and led to selection of plants that had defensive adaptations. Early insect herbivores were mandibulate and bit or chewed vegetation; but the evolution of vascular plants lead to the co-evolution of other forms of herbivory, such as sap-sucking, leaf mining, gall forming and nectar-feeding.|$|E
5|$|The Ichneumonidae are {{specialized}} parasitoids, {{often of}} Lepidoptera larvae deeply buried <b>in</b> <b>plant</b> tissues, {{which may be}} woody.

Some of the largest species, including Rhyssa persuasoria and Megarhyssa macrurus, parasitise horntails, large sawflies whose adult females also have impressively long ovipositors. Some parasitic species have a mutualistic relationship with a polydnavirus that weakens the host's immune system and replicates in the oviduct of the female wasp.|$|E

40|$|The mystery {{surrounding}} {{high concentrations}} of Cr(III) <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> has been uncovered. It is attributed {{to the presence of}} low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOA) in soil <b>in</b> which the <b>plants</b> are growing. Apart from that, the factors influencing solubility of Cr(VI) in soil have also been investigated. It was found that the solubility of Cr(VI) species is governed by the presence of CO 3 2 − ions in a soil solution that resulted when atmospheric CO 2 dissolves in soil–water. Concentrations of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) were determined <b>in</b> <b>plants,</b> collected on unpolluted soils in different geographical areas. It was found that the concentration of Cr(VI) <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> correlated with the soluble fraction of Cr(VI) in soil, while Cr(III) concentration <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> is limited by concentration LMWOA in soil. It can therefore be concluded that the high level of Cr(III) <b>in</b> <b>plants</b> is also due to the direct absorptions of the species from soil rich in organic acids...|$|R
