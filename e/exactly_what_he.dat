5|$|Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus. The actor {{was tired}} of doing {{independent}} films where his expectations were not met; when he met with director Bryan Singer, he went into a 15-minute tirade telling him {{what it was like}} to work with him. After Baldwin was finished, Singer told him <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> expected and wanted, which impressed the actor.|$|E
5|$|As {{the senator}} {{discussed}} their finances, the telecast again showed Pat Nixon, fixedly watching her husband. Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze {{was because she}} did not know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> would say, and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and {{that he and his wife}} owned no stocks or bonds.|$|E
50|$|Both sides mistake him {{for someone}} else—an American assassin—and neither side can {{understand}} why Carr is ignoring them. The CIA {{take it as a}} sign of defiance, the Associates perceive him as a cool and collected professional, who knows <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> doing and is difficult to predict.|$|R
50|$|Eddie's {{intelligence}} and capacity to learn tricks are very inconsistent, sometimes being incapable {{of learning to}} sit {{and at other times}} looking left and right on Martin's command. It was once shown that the only word he understands is his own name but other times he seems to understand <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> being told.|$|R
5000|$|In the NFL, Belk {{proved to}} be a versatile, reliable, and very {{intelligent}} football player, starting at both defensive end and tackle. One of his coaches, Dick Nolan, made this testimony in reference to Belk, “What I like about Bill is that he’s very smart. <b>He</b> knows <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> doing out there and can adjust to any situation." ...|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1894, Robey {{travelled}} to Manchester {{to participate in the}} pantomime Jack and Jill, where he was paid £25 a week for a three-month contract. He did not appear in Jack and Jill until the third act but pleased the holiday crowds nonetheless. During one performance the scenery mechanism failed, which forced him to improvise for the first time. Robey fabricated a story that he had just dined with the Lord Mayor before detailing <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had eaten. The routine was such a hit that it was incorporated into the show as part of the script.|$|E
5|$|Despite his bluster, Kutuzov {{knew from}} dispatches that his army {{had been too}} badly hurt to fight a {{continuing}} action the following day. He knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing: by fighting the pitched battle, he could now retreat with the Russian army still intact, lead its recovery, and force the weakened French forces to move even further from their bases of supply. The dénouement became a textbook example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply. On September8, the Russian army {{moved away from the}} battlefield in twin columns to Semolino, allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for 5 weeks a Russian surrender that would never come.|$|E
5|$|When a {{musician}} hears Bix's solo on 'Singing the Blues', he becomes aware after two bars that the soloist knows <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{is doing and}} that he has an exquisite sense of discord and resolution. He knows also that this player is endowed with the rarest jazz gift of all, a sense of form which lends to an improvised performance a coherence which no amount of teaching can produce. The listening musician, whatever his generation or his style, recognizes Bix as a modern, modernism being not a style but an attitude.|$|E
5000|$|Despite being despised by {{the other}} convicts for his heinous crimes and {{affiliation}} with the Alliance for Purity, T-Bag is quite eloquent and many women find him charming. Knepper comments that, [...] "T-Bag's not crazy. <b>He</b> knows <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> doing. He's {{not going to make}} himself stupid." [...] In a separate interview, Knepper says, [...] "I never play him like a stereotypical racist or redneck. He's actually quite cunning and smart." [...] He likens the character to [...] "Truman Capote without a degree." ...|$|R

5|$|Shooting for {{the film}} was {{conducted}} in Kota, Jakarta, and Semarang, Central Java, {{over a period of}} one month. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that the most difficult scenes to shoot were those which happened in modern times, especially the riots; for set design, however, Indra Tamoron Musu found those that occurred in the past to be the most difficult, owing to the research necessary. The scenes at the house were shot separately; those occurring in 1998 were shot first and those occurring in the past were shot after the crew had spent a week renovating the house. Hasiholan later recalled that Soeriaatmadja was a controlling director who told the actors <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted in a clear manner. However, cinematographer Ical Tanjung said that Soeriaatmadja was still open to feedback from the cast and crew. Editing, which was done by Waluyo Ichwandiardono, took another three months.|$|E
25|$|Dalton {{has been}} with the show since season 4 and takes part in the vast {{majority}} of the show's main storylines. He has a strong relationship with Red, joining him on his regular fishing trips and taking part in many aspects of the Possum Lodge operations. He also takes his fatherhood very seriously, often trying to pass on his ideas and wisdom to other people (most notably Harold). He generally tells people <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thinks of them, even if it means offending them.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, Geronimo {{agreed to}} tell his story to S. M. Barrett, Superintendent of Education in Lawton, Oklahoma. Barrett had to appeal to President Roosevelt to gain {{permission}} to publish the book. Geronimo came to each interview knowing <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted to say. He refused to answer questions or alter his narrative. Barrett did not seem to take many liberties with Geronimo's story as translated by Asa Daklugie. Frederick Turner re-edited this autobiography by removing some of Barrett's footnotes and writing an introduction for the non-Apache readers. Turner notes the book is in the style of an Apache reciting part of his oral history.|$|E
50|$|Victimized, {{along with}} family and friends, by an {{elaborate}} extortion scheme, Weaver is forced to spy and steal for the enigmatic Jerome Cobb. Under Cobb's direction, Weaver infiltrates the Company and attempts to learn its secrets before the upcoming meeting {{of the board of}} directors (called the Court of Proprietors). Trouble is, Cobb won't (or can't) say <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> looking for, or why. As is typical in this genre, the truth is not revealed until the final pages.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pleasure}} {{of listening to}} Usher is the {{pleasure of}} listening to a singer who knows <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> doing. 'Truth Hurts,' a seemingly innocent (if plaintive) 1970's throwback, turns nasty when the narrator suddenly reveals that the first two verses were full of lies. Which raises the question: are these supposed 'confessions' true? He loves toying with his audience this way, loves telling us exactly how bad he is, then daring us to believe him.|$|R
60|$|Melville {{had taken}} up Punch--he was in that mood when a man takes up anything--and was reading, {{he did not know}} <b>exactly</b> <b>what.</b> Presently <b>he</b> sighed, looked up, and {{discovered}} Chatteris entering the room.|$|R
25|$|In 1947, {{the team}} rejoined editor Sullivan, {{by then the}} founder and {{publisher}} of the comic-book company Magazine Enterprises where they created the short-lived comical crime-fighter Funnyman. Shuster continued to draw comics after the failure of Funnyman, although <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> drew is uncertain. Comic historian Ted White wrote that Shuster continued to draw horror stories into the 1950s. In 2009, comics historian Craig Yoe said Shuster was the anonymous illustrator for Nights of Horror, an underground sadomasochistic fetish paperback book series. This was based on character similarities, and comparison of the artistic style between the illustrations and those of the cast of the Superman comics.|$|E
25|$|As can be seen, the Skjöldunga saga retells {{the story}} of Eadgils {{fighting}} his uncle Onela, but in this version Onela is no longer Eadgils' uncle, but a Norwegian king of Oppland. This change is {{generally considered to be}} a late confusion between the core province of the Swedes, Uppland, and its Norwegian namesake Oppland. Whereas, Beowulf leaves the Danish court with the suspicion that Hroðulf (Rolfo Krage, Hrólfr Kraki) might claim the Danish throne for himself at the death of Hroðgar (Roas, Hróarr), it is <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> does in Scandinavian tradition. A notable difference is that, in Beowulf, Eadgils receives the help of the Geatish king Beowulf against Onela, whereas it is the Danish king Hroðulf who provides help in Scandinavian tradition.|$|E
25|$|While in prison, Wilde wrote Douglas a {{long and}} {{critical}} letter titled De Profundis, describing <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> felt about him, which Wilde was not permitted to send, but {{which may or may}} not have been sent to Douglas after Wilde's release: it was given to Robbie Ross, with the instructions to make a copy and send the original to Lord Alfred Douglas. Lord Alfred Douglas later said that he received only a letter from Ross with a few choice quotes, and didn't know there was a letter until it was referenced in a biography of Wilde's that Ross consulted on. Following Wilde's release (on 19 May 1897), the two reunited in August at Rouen, but stayed together only a few months owing to personal differences and the various pressures on them.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{points of}} Interest include the [...] "Sidingless House", a true marvel in {{renovation}} that will beg the observer to wonder <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> looking at and why. Meanwhile, the [...] "House in the Middle of the Street" [...] is the pièce de résistance of Lord Paton's estate. Situated {{in the center}} of 1st Ave East, the structure is meant to defy all logic and reasoning as it meshes residence with road allowance forcing the potential tourist to re-evaluate their concept of [...] "motor-home".|$|R

25|$|Jung did {{not plan}} to study {{psychiatry}} since it was not considered prestigious at the time. But, studying a psychiatric textbook, he became very excited when he discovered that psychoses are personality diseases. His interest was immediately captured—it combined the biological and the spiritual, <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was searching for. In 1895 Jung began to study medicine at the University of Basel. Barely a year later in 1896, his father Paul died and left the family near destitute. They were helped out by relatives who also contributed to Jung's studies. During his student days, he entertained his contemporaries with the family legend, that his paternal grandfather was the illegitimate son of Wolfgang Goethe and his German great-grandmother, Sophie Ziegler. In later life, he pulled back from this tale, saying only that Sophie {{was a friend of}} Goethe's niece.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Ament left us {{this morning}} after a delay here of five days. The Mark Twain article in the North American Review cut him like a knife and weighs deeply on him, but he takes it in a most {{beautiful}} spirit. The sympathy of all the Peking missionaries, and their absolute confidence in his integrity and the uprightness of his course {{has been a great}} help to him, and I think he goes back well prepared to set things right so far as he can in person. He plans to write a series of articles telling <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has done. It will be a story worth telling, even if there were no occasion for it as a vindication of his character. I have been with him all this first week since he heard about the Sun and the Review articles. The calm and sweet spirit in which he has taken it and his brave resolution to set the matter right so far as in him lies, is answer enough for those who know of it.|$|E
25|$|The Cimbri {{conveniently}} {{marched into}} Hispania and the Teutoni milled around in northern Gaul, leaving Marius to prepare his army. One of his legates was his old quaestor, Sulla, {{which shows that}} at this time there was no ill-will between them. In 104 BC, Marius was returned as consul again for 103 BC. Though he could have continued to operate as proconsul, it seems that the position as consul would make his position as commander unassailable and avoid any problems with the consuls if he was only a proconsul. Marius seems {{to have been able to}} get <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted, and it even seems that his support determined whom the people would elect as his colleagues (his choice was apparently determined, on several occasions, on the basis of their malleability: only Catulus in 102 BC, and Flaccus in 100 BC, would have been serious candidates in their own right without his support, and even Flaccus was described as more servant than partner in the office.) In 103 BC, the Germans still did not emerge from Hispania, and conveniently Marius's colleague (L. Aurelius Orestes, son of C. Gracchus's commander in Sardinia in 126 BC–124 BC) died, so Marius had to return to Rome to oversee the elections, being re-elected for 102 BC.|$|E
60|$|It needed {{but little}} shrewdness to guess those parchments before {{him to be}} legal {{documents}} touching the Canaples estates, and his occupation that of casting up <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> profit <b>he</b> would reap from his infamous work of betrayal.|$|R

25|$|Before {{playing in}} the NHL, Sheldon {{was a member of}} the Fort Saskatchewan Traders in the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL). He was drafted in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft in the third round, 71st overall, by the New Jersey Devils.Souray {{reported}} to his second Devils training camp overweight and out-of-shape, prompting general manager Lou Lamoriello called him embarrassing, and that he would never play for the team if it happened again. Souray credits Lamoriello for calling him out, and says it was <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> needed to succeed at such a high level. He made his NHL debut in the 1997–98 season. He finished his rookie season with modest scoring totals of three goals and ten points in 60 games, but most importantly established that he was capable of being an NHL regular. He scored his first NHL goal on a powerful slapshot late in a December 16, 1997, game against the rival New York Rangers to break a 3–3 tie late in the third period and send the Devils to a 4–3 win. Souray played in New Jersey from 1997 to midway through the 1999–2000 season, earning a reputation as a big, steady, physical defender with a mean streak and a hard shot. However, with the Devils preparing to make their Stanley Cup run late in the 1999–2000 season and believing they needed more offence from the blue line, Souray was traded to the Montreal Canadiens on March 1, 2000, in exchange for Vladimir Malakhov.|$|E
500|$|Kristen Cloke, Morgan's wife, {{was cast}} as teacher Valerie Lewton. [...] "I have {{incredible}} respect for them," [...] said Cloke. [...] "Jim's {{the kind of}} director who knows <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants.

The fact that he won't move on until he's got <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wants creates a safe environment, which allows me to experiment and try different things". [...] Cloke described her part as [...] "strong and sassy – in control. After the crash she comes unglued, probably more than any of the kids, and it's a quick, drastic change. I had to understand the psychology of a person who can turn on a dime like that".|$|E
500|$|Another dilemma Beeman faced {{was keeping}} the {{performances}} realistic, and not [...] "over-the-top". Beeman believes that [...] "Tempest" [...] proves <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought about Smallville, {{that the show}} is [...] "seen and experienced {{from the point of}} view of a teenager". Beeman explains, [...] "If you’re in love, you’re head over heels in love. If you’re scared, you’re terrified. If you’re sad, you’re in grief. The emotions are strong, but it doesn’t mean that the performances are over-the-top." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Memphis Flyer, in a {{positive}} review of the album, wrote of the accordion sounds of Clownhead as being [...] "fully integrated as an organic component and no longer {{jumps out of the}} mix to call attention to itself.

Head honcho Paul Rogers knows <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> doing navigating through some tricky turf, leading the band to areas of respectability where accordions are rarely found", while also praising the humor of the band's lyrics.|$|R
