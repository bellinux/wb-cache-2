5|$|Giron and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz {{claimed that}} the recall defeat was due to voter {{suppression}}. The Denver Post disputed this, saying that the result wasn't caused by voter suppression but the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> people showed up to vote against Giron than to vote for her. Gessler said that the Democrats fared worse where more people turned out. Wasserman Schultz also stated that the money spent by the NRA and the Koch brothers {{made it impossible for}} Democrats to win.|$|E
5|$|As of October 2011, {{consumption}} of liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel has cut between 4 and 19%, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> than 1 million cars {{have been added}} to Iran's fleet. Increased use of compressed natural gas (CNG) to fuel cars has also reportedly played a role in this. According to the government, if oil products consumption had not been managed, {{consumption of}} gasoline would have increased to 120 million liters per day, while by reforming consumption pattern the figure has fallen to 60 million liters per day. In November 2011, the Government reported that the subsidy reform plan has saved Iran $6 billion.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, {{under the}} control of the Special Air Task Force (SATFOR), the TDR-1 was {{deployed}} operationally to the South Pacific for operations against the Japanese. TDR-1 aircraft equipped a single mixed squadron (Special Air Task Group 1) along with TBM Avenger control aircraft, and the first operational mission took place on September 27, conducting bombing operations against Japanese ships. Despite this success, the assault drone program had already been canceled after the production of 189 TDR-1 aircraft, due to a combination of continued technical problems, the aircraft failing to live up to expectations, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> conventional weaponry was proving adequate for the defeat of Japan. The final mission was flown on October 27, with 50 drones having been expended on operations, 31 aircraft successfully striking their targets, without loss to the pilots of STAG-1.|$|E

5|$|Receiving {{light and}} other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer.

The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{reality of}} Domitian's autocracy was further {{highlighted}} by the <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>more</b> than any emperor since Tiberius, he spent significant periods of {{time away from the}} capital. Although the Senate's power had been in decline since the fall of the Republic, under Domitian the seat of power was no longer even in Rome, but rather wherever the Emperor was. Until the completion of the Flavian Palace on the Palatine Hill, the imperial court was situated at Alba or Circeii, and sometimes even farther afield. Domitian toured the European provinces extensively, and spent at least three years of his reign in Germania and Illyricum, conducting military campaigns on the frontiers of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius subdulcis, {{commonly}} known as the mild milkcap or beech milk cap, is an edible mushroom in the genus Lactarius. It is brown in colour, with a large number of gills and a particularly thin layer of flesh in the cap. Mycorrhizal, the mushroom is found from late summer to late autumn at the base of beech trees in small groups or individually, where {{it is one of the}} two most common species of fungi. Alternatively, it can be found in large groups in fields, sometimes with more than a hundred individual mushrooms. It is found in Europe, and, despite previous research to the contrary, is absent in North America. Although considered edible, it is not particularly useful as food due to its ivy-like taste and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> choice mushrooms will be easily found at the same time. L.subdulcis is known for its abundant, sweet-tasting milk that, unlike the latex of some of its relatives, does not stain fabric yellow.|$|E

This only holds if the paper in the land fill is not decomposted. In most landfills, this is the case and leads to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> than half of the greenhouse gas emissions from the life cycle of paper products occur from landfill methane emissions.|$|E
25|$|During the Gilded Age, highly {{prominent}} laity such as banker J. P.

These philanthropists propelled the Episcopal Church into a quasi-national position of importance while at the same time giving the church a central role in the cultural transformation of the country. Another mark of influence is the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> than a quarter of all presidents of the United States have been Episcopalians (see religious affiliations of Presidents of the United States).

25|$|The {{asymmetry}} {{between the}} Earth {{and the space}} ship is manifested in this diagram by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> blue-shifted (fast aging) images are received by the ship. Put another way, the space ship sees the image change from a red-shift (slower aging of the image) to a blue-shift (faster aging of the image) at the midpoint of its trip (at the turnaround, 5years after departure); the Earth sees {{the image of the}} ship change from red-shift to blue shift after 9years (almost {{at the end of the}} period that the ship is absent). In the next section, one will see another asymmetry in the images: the Earth twin sees the ship twin age by the same amount in the red and blue shifted images; the ship twin sees the Earth twin age by different amounts in the red and blue shifted images.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} four years the three Balkenende {{cabinets}} had implemented an ambitious program of social-economic reforms, including tax cuts, reforms to the social welfare system and investments in education. Their aim was to jump start the Dutch economy. Initially there was great public dissatisfaction with this policy, with large demonstrations in 2003, 2004 and 2005 by the main labour union FNV and the three main opposition parties. They criticised the government for taking these measures at the wrong point in time, during a recession, and they claimed that the government made the poor and socially weaker pay for the economic recovery. A major focus of this debate was on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> than 10% of the people were said to live in poverty, as exemplified by the rising number of 'voedselbanken' (give-away shops for food). As the economy began to perform better in 2006 the public dissatisfaction decreased.|$|E

25|$|Various {{cultural}} and social values have historically contributed to gender disparity in education. According to work done by Denga, one prominent cultural view {{is that it is}} better for the woman to stay home and learn to tend to her family instead of attending school. To explain the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> boys than girls participated in education, Nigerian researcher Obasi identified a host of constraints with 'Nigerian tradition' being named as top of the list. The 'Nigerian tradition' was explained as a tradition that attaches higher value to a man than a woman, whose place {{is believed to be the}} kitchen. A study by the University of Ibadan linked the imbalance in boys' and girls‚Äô participation in schooling was to the long-held belief in male superiority and female subordination. This situation was further aggravated by patriarchal practices which gave girls no traditional rights to succession. Therefore, the same patriarchal practices encouraged preference to be given to the education of a boy rather than a girl.|$|E
25|$|India and the Arab {{states of}} the Persian Gulf enjoy strong {{cultural}} and economic ties.

The annual remittance by Indian expatriates in the region amounted to US$20 billion in 2007. India {{is one of the largest}} trading partners of the CCASG with non-oil trade between India and Dubai alone amounting to US$19 billion in 2007. The Persian Gulf countries have also played an important role in addressing India's energy security concerns, with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait regularly increasing their oil supply to India to meet the country's rising energy demand. In 2005, Kuwait increased its oil exports to India by 10% increasing the net oil trade between the two to US$4.5 billion. In 2008, Qatar decided to invest US$5 billion in India's energy sector.|$|E
25|$|Growth in the {{secondary}} market continued trending upward in 2014 reaching its highest level yet, with an estimated total transaction volume of $49.3bn per the Setter Capital Volume Report 2014, as follows: private equity $37.9 billion, real estate secondaries $6.8 billion, hedge fund side pockets $2.5 billion, infrastructure funding $1.9 billion and timber fund deals at $0.2 billion. According to Setter Capital Inc, there were a total of 1270 transactions in 2014, with an average size of approximately $37.7 million. Although the number of transactions was roughly {{the same as in}} 2013, the average deal size increased 34.6% year over year, reflecting the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>more</b> multi-hundred million / billion+ dollar transactions were completed in 2014.
