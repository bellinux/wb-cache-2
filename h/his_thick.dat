25|$|Joel {{originally}} {{sang the}} song in <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> New York accent, but decided to do a Charles impression instead when he noticed Charles was trying to imitate his style. The song was positively received by critics. The single peaked at #75 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and at #3 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. The music video features Joel and Charles recording the vocal tracks together.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, at age 20, Wood {{enrolled}} in the Minneapolis School of Art but only lasted one term. Arriving in New York City with his brother Glenn and mother Alma (of Finnish descent), after his military discharge in July 1948, Wood found employment at Bickford's restaurant as a busboy. During his time off he carried <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> portfolio of drawings all over midtown Manhattan, visiting every publisher he could find. He briefly attended the Hogarth School of Art but dropped out after one semester.|$|E
500|$|Teach {{captured}} a French merchant vessel, renamed her Queen Anne's Revenge, and equipped her with 40 guns. He became a renowned pirate, his nickname derived from <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> black beard and fearsome appearance; he {{was reported to}} have tied lit fuses (slow matches) under his hat to frighten his enemies. [...] He formed an alliance of pirates and blockaded the port of Charles Town, South Carolina, ransoming the port's inhabitants. He then ran Queen Anne's Revenge aground on a sandbar near Beaufort, North Carolina. [...] He parted company with Bonnet and settled in Bath Town, where he accepted a royal pardon. [...] But he was soon back at sea, where he attracted the attention of Alexander Spotswood, the Governor of Virginia. [...] Spotswood arranged for a party of soldiers and sailors to capture the pirate, which they did on 22November 1718 following a ferocious battle. Teach and several of his crew were killed by a small force of sailors led by Lieutenant Robert Maynard.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his flying service Ball was {{primarily}} a [...] "lone-wolf" [...] pilot, stalking his prey from below until he drew close enough to use his top-wing Lewis gun on its Foster mounting, angled to fire upwards into the enemy's fuselage. [...] According to fellow ace and Victoria Cross recipient James McCudden, [...] "it was quite {{a work of art}} to pull this gun down and shoot upwards, {{and at the same time}} manage one's machine accurately". [...] Ball was as much a loner on the ground as in the air, preferring to stay in his hut on the flight line away from other squadron members. His off-duty hours were spent tending his small garden and practising the violin. [...] Though not unsociable per se, he was extremely sensitive and shy. Ball acted as his own mechanic on his aircraft and, as a consequence, was often untidy and dishevelled. His singularity in dress extended to his habit of flying without a helmet and goggles, and he wore <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> black hair longer than regulations generally permitted.|$|E
500|$|With {{help from}} Mimi and Lennon's headmaster, Lennon was {{accepted}} into the Liverpool College of Art because his aunt insisted {{that he should have}} some sort of academic qualifications, even though Lennon was beginning to show an interest in music. She opposed the idea of him forming a band and disapproved of McCartney because he was, [...] "working class", calling him [...] "John's little friend". When she later met Harrison, she [...] "hated him" [...] because of <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> Liverpudlian accent and Teddy Boy clothes. Lennon and McCartney often met at Mendips to write songs, and rehearsed in the glass-panelled porch {{at the front of the}} house, which was the only place they were allowed to play. She once asked Parkes to take her to The Cavern to see Lennon and the Beatles play, but when she descended into the damp, dark cellar; full of screaming teenagers, she shouted to Parkes, [...] "Get him [...] out, get him out! Tell him to come off the stage! He can't stay here.... We'll have to stop this!" [...] The band's first residency in Hamburg exasperated her because she wanted Lennon to continue his studies, but he placated her by greatly exaggerating the sum of money he would earn.|$|E
500|$|Bostock's {{deposition}} describes Teach as a [...] "tall spare {{man with}} a very black beard which he wore very long". [...] It is the first recorded account of Teach's appearance and {{is the source of}} his cognomen, Blackbeard. [...] Later descriptions mention that <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> black beard was braided into pigtails, sometimes tied in with small coloured ribbons. [...] Johnson (1724) described him as [...] "such a figure that imagination cannot form an idea of a fury from hell to look more frightful." [...] Whether Johnson's description was entirely truthful or embellished is unclear, but it seems likely that Teach understood the value of appearances; better to strike fear into the heart of one's enemies, than rely on bluster alone. [...] Teach was tall, with broad shoulders. [...] He wore knee-length boots and dark clothing, topped with a wide hat and sometimes a long coat of brightly coloured silk or velvet. [...] Johnson also described Teach in times of battle as wearing [...] "a sling over his shoulders, with three brace of pistols, hanging in holsters like bandoliers; and stuck lighted matches (Slow match) under his hat", the latter apparently to emphasise the fearsome appearance he wished to present to his enemies. [...] Despite his ferocious reputation though, there are no verified accounts of his ever having murdered or harmed those he held captive. [...] Teach may have used other aliases; on 30November, the Monserrat Merchant encountered two ships and a sloop, commanded by a Captain Kentish and Captain Edwards (the latter a known alias of Stede Bonnet).|$|E

500|$|In 1888 the musicologist Hugo Riemann {{recommended}} Busoni to Martin Wegelius, {{director of}} the Institute of Music at Helsingfors (now Helsinki, Finland, then part of the Russian Empire), for the vacant position of advanced piano instructor. This was Busoni's first permanent post. Amongst his close colleagues and associates there were the conductor and composer Armas Järnefelt, the writer Adolf Paul, and the composer Jean Sibelius, with whom he struck up a continuing friendship. Paul described Busoni at this time as [...] "a small, slender Italian with chestnut beard, grey eyes, young and gay, with... a small round cap perched proudly on <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> artist's curls". Between 1888 and 1890 Busoni gave about thirty piano recitals and chamber concerts in Helsingfors; amongst his compositions at this period were a set of Finnish folksongs for piano duet Op. 27. In 1889, visiting Leipzig, he heard a performance on the organ of JS Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor (BWV 565), and was persuaded by his pupil Kathi Petri (the mother of his future pupil Egon Petri, then only 5 years old), to transcribe it for piano. Busoni's biographer Edward Dent writes that [...] "This {{was not only the}} beginning of [...] transcriptions, but... the beginning of that style of pianoforte touch and technique which was entirely [...] creation." [...] Returning to Helsingfors, in March of the same year Busoni met his future wife, Gerda Sjöstrand, the daughter of the Swedish sculptor Carl Eneas Sjöstrand, and proposed to her within a week. For her he composed Kultaselle (Finnish: To the beloved) for cello and piano (published 1891 without opus number, BV 237).|$|E
2500|$|Blackham {{was born}} in the inner-Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy North, the son of {{newsagent}} Frederick Kane Blackham and his wife Lucinda (née McCarthy). Blackham became a bank clerk, and held a position in the Colonial Bank of Australasia for many years. It is said that <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> dark beard, perceived then as a sign of an equable and reliable nature, reassured his customers. His brother-in-law was George Eugene [...] "Joey" [...] Palmer.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{was widely}} seen as being in {{over his head and}} was an easy target for his NHL colleagues, who called him [...] "Jed Clampett" [...] behind his back due to <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> Southern accent and {{fundamentalist}} Christian views. Early in the 1998–99 season, the Lightning lost 10 games in a row, all but ending any chance of making the playoffs. They ended up losing 54 games that year—more than the expansion Nashville Predators.|$|E

Francis' mother, Anna McDonnell, said she saw the same man earlier that day. She told the reporters, [...] "He came shuffling down the street mumbling to himself and making queer motions with his hands ... I saw <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> grey hair and his drooping grey moustache. Everything about him seemed faded and grey." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Omar from Brooklyn" [...] {{is another}} regular {{called on the}} Boomer and Carton Show. An avid Bills fan, Omar's {{trademark}} is to call in on a Monday to rant (often incoherently due to <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> accent) about the Bills shortcomings and his hatred for other New York teams. During these calls there is usually Middle Eastern music playing in the background, courtesy of WFAN. Boomer and Carton had Omar in studio as a guest, and Omar received a pie in the face from Boomer. Omar also received tickets from Boomer to a Jets-Bills game in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Originally Joel {{sang the}} song in <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> Hicksville accent, and Charles did the same. According to Joel, Charles was very easy to work with. [...] "He was just waiting for a cue from me," [...] Joel recalled. [...] "He would have taken the thing {{anywhere}} I wanted to take it." [...] Originally, Joel was nervous about recording with Charles, and was unsure how to record the song. Producer Phil Ramone told Joel to [...] "challenge him," [...] {{and to do it}} the way Joel wanted to. So, Joel did his best impression of Charles, and Charles understood, and they sang together in the same style.|$|E

2500|$|In Philosopher’s Stone, Hagrid is {{mentioned}} as being twice {{as tall as}} the average man and nearly five times as wide but in the film, he is portrayed as being [...] and in later books {{he is said to}} be three times as wide. Hagrid is known for <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> West Country accent. Being a half-giant, he is less vulnerable to jinxes and spells than full-humans. In Order of the Phoenix, when Umbridge and some other wizards come to remove him from Hogwarts he fights back. They try to jinx and stun him, but the spells just bounce off him because of giant-inherited resistance to magic. Hagrid also shows this resilience at the end of Half-Blood Prince, during the chapter Flight of the Prince, withstanding a Death Eater’s powerful curses. Some potions are also ineffective with him, such as Polyjuice Potion, which is designed for human-only use.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{presentation}} of Bagaj..., Tudor Arghezi argued of H. Bonciu: [...] "From a sty of crude colors, {{with plenty of}} gilded gossamer rubbed into it, <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> and greasy brush [...] paints into the fresco of our spiritual bedlam". Felix Aderca too campaigned for the novel and its [...] "pages of genius". Another notable fan of the book was novelist and literary chronicler Mihail Sebastian, his Trăirist colleague, although he noted that Bonciu's text was not a fully formed novel. The same was concluded by Călinescu, who once described Bonciu the novelist {{as the author of}} [...] "prose poems". Other critics tend to rate Bagaj... as a poorly finished work, insisting on its centrifugal narrative—one such conservative voice was that of Pompiliu Constantinescu, who still saluted Bonciu's decision to move into the genre of [...] "Surreal prose", away from poetry. Some students of Bonciu's work disagree: according to Adriana Babeți, the [...] "disconcerting amalgam" [...] gives Bonciu his originality and strength.|$|E
2500|$|Misaubin {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} satirical prints. [...] Strikingly tall and thin, he was ridiculed for his fondness for alcohol, his outlandish manners, and <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> French accent: Watteau quoted his saying [...] "Prenez les pilules". [...] He was the model for the doctor in William Hogarth's The Harlot's Progress (Plate 5), and he is one of four physicians held up for ridicule in Henry Fielding's Tom Jones. [...] Fielding says that Misaubin told people to address letters to him as [...] "To Dr. Misaubin in the World" [...] for [...] "there were few People in it to whom his great Reputation was not known" [...] (Tom Jones, book 13, chapter 2). [...] His museum at 96 St Martin's Lane may also have been the setting for the third and fifth scenes in Hogarth's Marriage à-la-mode, where the young Viscount brings a lady of little reputation to a quack doctor to cure her complaint, and brings her back to complain that the pills have not worked. [...] Misaubin is clearly not the quack doctor depicted.|$|E

2500|$|Philbin gained {{his first}} network TV {{exposure}} in 1967 as Joey Bishop's sidekick on The Joey Bishop Show on television (19671969). In a Johnny Carson-Ed McMahon vein, Bishop would playfully tease Philbin and Philbin {{would take the}} barbs in stride. [...] But his feelings were wounded when he learned from the network grapevine that ABC executives were dissatisfied with his work and <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> accent, so during the opening of one 1968 program, he launched an unplanned diatribe about [...] "not being wanted and letting down" [...] the program and abruptly quit on air. A few nights later, assured by Bishop that all was well and the barbs were not personal, Philbin returned. As revealed in his book, How I Got This Way, this was actually all a ruse planned by Bishop and Regis to steal the spotlight and attract some of Johnny Carson's viewers. When The Joey Bishop Show was canceled, Bishop returned the favor and walked off the show on the air unannounced, leaving Philbin to successfully carry the night on his own.|$|E
2500|$|With Shemp gone, Moe {{suggested}} that Curly fill {{the role of}} the third Stooge. But Healy felt that Curly, with <b>his</b> <b>thick,</b> chestnut [...] hair and elegant waxed mustache, did not [...] "look funny" [...] and was [...] "too handsome". Curly left the room and returned minutes later with his head shaven (the mustache remained very briefly). Healy quipped, [...] "Boy, don't you look girlie?" [...] Moe misheard the joke as [...] "curly," [...] and all who witnessed the exchange realized that the nickname [...] "Curly" [...] would be a perfect fit. In one of the few interviews Curly gave in his lifetime, he complained about the loss of his hair: [...] "I had to shave it off right down to the skin." [...] In 1934, MGM was building Healy up as a solo comedian in feature films and Healy dissolved the act to pursue his own career. Like Shemp, the team of Howard, Fine, and Howard was tired of Healy's alcoholism and abrasiveness and renamed their act the [...] "Three Stooges." [...] That same year, they signed on to appear in two-reel comedy short subjects for Columbia Pictures. The Stooges soon became the most popular short-subject attraction, with Curly playing an integral part in the trio's work.|$|E
2500|$|Lacking the {{photogenic}} {{looks of}} many of his rock and roll contemporaries, Orbison eventually developed a persona that did not reflect his personality. He had no publicist in the early 1960s, no presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. Life magazine called him an [...] "anonymous celebrity". After leaving <b>his</b> <b>thick</b> eyeglasses on an airplane in 1963 while on tour with the Beatles, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Wayfarer sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. His biographers suggest that although he had {{a good sense of humor}} and was never morose, Orbison was very shy and suffered from severe stage fright; wearing sunglasses helped him hide somewhat from the attention. The ever-present sunglasses led some people to assume, then and now, that the stationary performer was blind. The black clothes and desperation in his songs led to an aura of mystery and introversion. Years later Orbison said, [...] "I wasn't trying to be weird, you know? I didn't have a manager who told me to dress or how to present myself or anything. But the image developed of a man of mystery and a quiet man in black somewhat of a recluse, although I never was, really." ...|$|E
