500|$|Yusef is {{introduced}} {{as part of}} a storyline involving the Masood family. Tamwar dates Afia and when Yusef {{is introduced}} to Tamwar's parents Masood and Zainab, Masood [...] "explodes" [...] with anger at the sight of him, recognising him as a man from their past. Ganatra explained that although Yusef allegedly tried to save Zainab from the fire, all Masood saw was Zainab locked in a burning kitchen: [...] "we are only playing it from each person's point of view. Yusef is playing it {{from his point of view}} that he did try and save her. Masood is saying, 'All I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> went back to get her and she had been locked in this kitchen and it was on fire'." [...] Patel said the storyline is a shocking one with a clever twist. In March2011, Bhatti said he was staying with EastEnders until around June 2011, and would [...] "see from there". He made his first appearance on 23November2010. Ganatra spoke at the British Soap Awards 2011 to Digital Spy and praised the impact of Yusef saying,"He's very much an arch-villain - he's a great character who's there to put jeopardy into the Masoods' relationship. Zainab and Masood have been married for 28 years and they're mad about each other - for someone to come and destroy that slightly, it's exciting. It's exciting for us to play." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "God knows!" [...] I answered. [...] "This {{thing has}} {{swallowed}} me up. The {{only thing that}} I do <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must {{go on to the}} end." ...|$|E
60|$|What <b>is</b> not {{generally}} <b>known</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there myself. I appeared,--in rivalry with Prince Luis Fernando--dressed as a Bombay soda water bottle, with aerial opalescent streaks of light flashing from the costume which was bound with single wire.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{next thing}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> awoke {{in the house}} of the White Witch and saw you {{sleeping}} at my side and the Witch leaning back upon her bed and smiling at me through the thin blanket with which she covers herself up, for I could see the laughter in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|ERNEST. Well, all <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> {{told her}} the mine was {{probably}} a frost she went for me like steam.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know, Pambasa. All I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{weary of}} this foolishness, {{and of the}} world. Tell me of {{something}} that will lighten my heart, for it is heavy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, father. Who can say? All {{these things}} are a mystery. All I do <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have never seen a}} ghost, and I doubt if I ever shall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You may jaw,' said Bradshaw at last, 'as {{much as you}} jolly well please, but I'm {{not going}} to give this away. All you're going to <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shan't be there tomorrow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{paid for}} it. It {{was two years}} and over before I knew what happened. All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> Julian Jones and <b>that</b> I'd <b>been</b> blacklisted in the big strike, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> married to Sarah here. <b>I</b> mean <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> didn't know {{anything}} in between, and when Sarah tried to talk about it, it gave me pains in the head. I mean my head was queer, and I <b>knew</b> it <b>was</b> queer.|$|R
6000|$|... "By Aphrodite, or by Isis, {{or both of}} them I did not <b>know.</b> All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{must seek}} him, then and evermore, as seek I do to-day and shall perchance through æons yet unborn. So I followed, as I was taught and commanded, the sistrum being my guide, how it matters not, and giving me the means, and so at last I came to this ancient land whereof the ruin in which you sit <b>was</b> once <b>known</b> as Kôr." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{quotation}} {{was hardly}} {{out of my}} lips before we had rounded the corner above the Convent; and a few yards further on could see across to Sanjowlie. In {{the centre of the}} level road stood the black and white liveries, the yellow-paneled 'rickshaw, and Mrs. Keith-Wessington. I pulled up, looked, rubbed my eyes, and, I believe must have said something. The next thing <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> lying face downward on the road with Kitty kneeling above me in tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that I do not know. Some corporation, perhaps, or some hospital. All I <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am not. That he {{has told}} me quite plainly. And he was very right to do so," [...] added George, after a pause.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am as pitiful {{a puzzle}} to myself as I {{can be to}} you," [...] he replied. [...] "All I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't want to marry anyone. And yet I am sure I could die for you, Grizel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] cried Elizabeth,--"no. I do {{not know}} him. I {{do not know}} him. There is something.... But I don't know. All I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not know him." [...] Her face was a face of {{infinite}} distress.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I did {{not exactly}} levitate, but {{something}} or someone {{seemed to get}} a hold of me, and I was just rushed along in a most tumultuous fashion. The next thing <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> standing at the door of <b>that</b> sepulchre, though <b>I</b> have no recollection of going up in the lift, or whatever it is. I believe those beastly caves are full of ghosts, or devils, and the worst of it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they have kept my solar-tope, which I put on this morning forgetting <b>that</b> it would <b>be</b> useless there." ...|$|R
5000|$|The New York Knicks {{selected}} Gallatin in the 1948 BAA draft. [...] "It was a {{dream come}} true. I really didn't know what to expect; {{it was my first}} plane ride, from St. Louis to New York. Here I am a boy from Wood River, a country boy, and going to the Big Apple", Gallatin explained. [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> loved to play basketball, and the Knicks had taken me with their number one choice. So <b>I</b> knew <b>that</b> they thought <b>I</b> had the kind of abilities they were looking for." ...|$|R
5000|$|She {{was quoted}} as saying, [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to act. Then someone told me about motion pictures, how drama was filmed. I was fascinated. I like {{mechanics}} anyway. I hunted all over New York for a studio - and couldn't find one. At last a super told me a man named Griffith was doing pictures for the Biograph Company. Mr. Griffith wasn't in. His assistant was. I told him my stage experience. He ignored it, scorned it. 'We {{want to know what}} you can do before a camera.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} any thing about it," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "All I <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{want to go to}} Berne with you some way or other in the diligence, and I wish to have you plan and arrange it all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{he said at}} last angrily. [...] "No {{doubt there}} are {{hundreds}} of men in happy and favourable circumstances who say, as I do, that they don't believe in a God. I don't know. All I do <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am supremely miserable!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{say that}} I follow you, Miss Thurwell," [...] he said, shaking his head. [...] "All I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can prove this Mr. Bernard Brown, or Bernard Maddison, or {{whatever}} else he chooses to call himself, guilty of that murder. That's what we want, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It might if I {{knew how}} to work it," [...] said the little girl. [...] "Ozma knows {{a lot of its}} magic, but I've never found out about it. All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> while <b>I</b> <b>am</b> wearing it, nothing can hurt me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are all niggers together," [...] said Tom vehemently. [...] "I cannot think why Norman {{should care}} for them more than for his own {{brothers}} and sisters. All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> my father, I would never give my consent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} struggle, {{but he seemed}} to hold me as if I were in a vice. I heard Alice scream, and then I must have fainted; for the next thing <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being carried along on horseback. I was so muffled up, and he held me so tight, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt it <b>was</b> no use to struggle; and I made up my mind to lie quite still, as if I was still insensible, till he put me down; and then--I think I {{intended}} to try and seize his pistol, or to get hold of a knife, if there was one and, if I could not kill him, to kill myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, the Colonel {{does seem}} to be on his high horse, ma'am. But you mustn't ask me what his {{business}} with Mr. Corey is, for I don't know. All that I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> met them at the landing, and that they conversed all the way down--on literary topics." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph! I won't {{be guided}} by your wise notions, Mr Premier. All I <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wish my clothes would wear out faster, so that I might dress myself in skins of some sort. I would have made an {{umbrella}} by this time, but it never seems to rain in this country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that," [...] replied the girl testily, as she cut a potato in two halves with {{unnecessary}} violence; [...] "all I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{would like to}} see her married to Bill Bowls. He's an able, handsome man. Indeed, I would gladly marry him myself if he asked me!" ...|$|E
5000|$|After leaving school, Govan studied English at the University of Oxford. He {{dropped out}} after a year {{to pursue a career}} in music. Govan states <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> torn between {{continuing}} his studies or focusing on becoming a musician; he ultimately decided to concentrate on the latter. Around this time, (by Govan's own estimation, 1991) he sent demos of his work to Mike Varney of Shrapnel Records. Varney was impressed and offered him a record deal. Govan declined, despite inititiating contact in the first place. He expained that: [...] "it was as though all I really wanted to <b>know</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> good enough … I found I was getting a bit wary of the shred movement." ...|$|R
5000|$|He has {{credited}} his father, {{who is from}} a West Indian background, with {{playing a}} wide variety of music while he was growing up, exposing Keto to genres as diverse as reggae, rock, and disco. [...] Keto wrote his first songs at the age of eight. He has recalled that around that time, [...] "I can remember sitting in my living room and listening to music and the feeling it gave me was incredible… All <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted {{to spend the rest of}} my life trying to give people <b>that</b> feeling. It <b>was</b> the only thing that made me feel unique and like I had an ability that exceed my own life." ...|$|R
60|$|And I {{told him}} a little about myself. I had been {{appointed}} to take charge while I least expected anything of the sort, not quite a fortnight ago. I didn't know either the ship or the people. Hadn't had the time in port to look about me or size anybody up. And as to the crew, all they <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> appointed to take the ship home. For the rest, I was almost {{as much of a}} stranger on board as himself, I said. And at the moment I felt it most acutely. <b>I</b> felt <b>that</b> it would take very little to make me a suspect person {{in the eyes of the}} ship's company.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no certain information," [...] the {{secretary}} replied, with a noncommittal air. [...] "All I <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had a long-distance telephone to burn certain documents, but before I {{could do so}} {{the room and the}} house were searched by New York detectives, whose warrant it was useless to resist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, all I {{wanted him}} to <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wasn't trying to punish {{him for what he}} said about things in general. You {{naturally}} got that idea, I reckon; but I always went in for lettin' people say what they please and think what they please; it's the only way in a free country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And who {{the devil}} cares," [...] said Hector, totally {{ignorant of the}} words of {{judicial}} action, [...] "whether you declare yourself divorced or married? And as to breaking your wand, or breaking the peace, or whatever you call it, all I <b>know</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will break your bones if you prevent the lad from harnessing the horses to obey his mistress's orders." ...|$|E
6000|$|ROBERTS: 'That's what I don't know.' He {{continues}} {{to wipe his}} head with his handkerchief, and to sputter a little from time to time. 'All <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> got--phew!--to <b>that</b> dark spot by the Frog Pond, just by--phew!--that little group of--phew!--evergreens, you know--phew!--' ...|$|R
60|$|When it <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{had begun}} another story my mother might ask {{what it was}} to be about this time.|$|R
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saw. It <b>was</b> {{a message}} from Bertha. Mary Phillips had devised the means of sending it. Bertha had sent it.|$|R
