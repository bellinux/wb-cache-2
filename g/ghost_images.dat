Covering {{the palm of her}} right hand is a blue cloth on top of which rests a rolled up kakemono or makimono scroll. In her left hand she grasps a red cloth—possibly a furoshiki—which is tied up as a round, flat parcel. Peaking out over her right shoulder is the brown feathered fletching of a single arrow.|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman lived {{close to}} the World Trade Center site, which was known as [...] "Ground Zero" [...] after the September 11 attacks that {{destroyed}} the World Trade Center. [...] Immediately following the attacks Spiegelman and Mouly rushed to their daughter Nadja's school, where Spiegelman's anxiety served only to increase his daughter's apprehensiveness over the situation. [...] Spiegelman and Mouly created a cover for the September 24 issue of The New Yorker which at first glance appears to be totally black, but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the World Trade Center towers in a slightly darker shade of black. [...] Mouly positioned the silhouettes so that the North Tower's antenna breaks into the [...] "W" [...] of The New Yorkers logo. [...] The towers were printed in black on a slightly darker black field employing standard four-color printing inks with an overprinted clear varnish. [...] In some situations, the <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> only became visible when the magazine was tilted toward a light source. [...] Spiegelman was critical of the Bush administration and the mass media over their handling of the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "grand opening" [...] of {{television}} station W9XAP {{took place in}} the evening of August 27, 1930. A number of receivers had been distributed to homes and stores in the Chicago area. Sears, Roebuck had advertised extensively and crowds had assembled to see and hear. Bill Hay was the announcer and several other WMAQ artists performed. The signal was strong and the program good, but <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> were terrific and the results disappointing. Apparently the nice crystal-steady signal from W9XAP made the <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> distinct and objectionable, whereas the self-excited oscillator of W9XAO seemed to make them less distinct and quite tolerable.|$|E

50|$|Uses an equiconvex {{crown glass}} lens with R1=R2, {{and a second}} flint glass lens with R3=-R2. The back of the flint glass lens is flat. A Littrow doublet can produce a <b>ghost</b> <b>image</b> between R2 and R3 because the lens {{surfaces}} of the two lenses have the same radii.

50|$|Erfle eyepieces are {{designed}} to have wide field of view (about 60 degrees), but they are unusable at high powers because they suffer from astigmatism and <b>ghost</b> <b>images.</b> However, with lens coatings at low powers (focal lengths of 20 mm and up) they are acceptable, and at 40 mm they can be excellent. Erfles are very popular because they have large eye lenses, good eye relief and can be very comfortable to use.|$|E

40|$|We show {{theoretically}} and experimentally that lensless ghost imaging with thermal {{light is}} fully interpretable {{in terms of}} classical statistical optics. The disappearance of the <b>ghost</b> <b>image</b> when the object and the reference planes are located at different distances from the source {{is due to the}} fading out of the intensity-intensity cross correlation between the two planes. Thus the visibility and the resolution of the <b>ghost</b> <b>image</b> are determined by the longitudinal coherence of the speckle beam, and no quantum explanation is necessary...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution <b>ghost</b> <b>image</b> and <b>ghost</b> {{diffraction}} {{experiments are}} performed {{by using a}} single source of thermal-like speckle light divided by a beam splitter.

50|$|In the United States, the GCR {{signal is}} a chirp in {{frequency}} of the modulating signal from 0 Hz to 4.2 MHz, transmitted during the vertical blanking interval over one video line (line 19 in the U.S.), shifted in phase by 180° once per frame, with this pattern inverted every four lines. Television receivers generate their own local versions of this signal, and use the comparison between the local and remote signals to tune out any <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> on the screen.|$|E
50|$|Wide field {{binoculars}} typically utilize {{some kind}} of Erfle configuration, patented in 1921. These have five or six elements in three groups. The groups may be two achromatic doublets with a double convex singlet between them or may all be achromatic doublets. These eyepieces tend not to perform as well as Kellner eyepieces at high power because they suffer from astigmatism and <b>ghost</b> <b>images.</b> However they have large eye lenses, excellent eye relief, and are comfortable to use at lower powers.|$|E
50|$|An {{indoor antenna}} may include an {{amplifier}} circuit, whereby powered {{reception of the}} signal can help with capturing {{as much of an}} FM, UHF/VHF signal, for amplifying a radio or television signal. Its draw backs are that any noise is usually amplified as well, and a common result from this is amplification of <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> (for analog signals), and any other perturberances that may be existing locally or even extra terrestrially like the Cosmic microwave background radiation for devices that work in that frequency range.|$|E

40|$|High-resolution <b>ghost</b> <b>image</b> and <b>ghost</b> {{diffraction}} are performed {{by using a}} single source of pseudo-thermal speckle light divided by a beam splitter. By only operating on the optical setup of {{the light in the}} reference arm, that never interacted with the object, we are able to pass from the image to the diffraction pattern. The product of spatial resolutions of the <b>ghost</b> <b>image</b> and <b>ghost</b> diffraction experiments is shown to overcome a limit which was formerly thought to be achievable only with entangled photons. A complementarity between the spatial coherence of the beams and their mutual correlation is demonstrated by showing a complementarity between ghost diffraction and ordinary diffraction patterns...|$|R
5000|$|Most screens {{are ready}} for re-coating at this stage, but {{sometimes}} screens will have to undergo a further step in the reclaiming process called dehazing. This additional step removes haze or [...] "ghost images" [...] {{left behind in the}} screen once the emulsion has been removed. <b>Ghost</b> <b>images</b> tend to faintly outline the open areas of previous stencils, hence the name. They are the result of ink residue trapped in the mesh, often in the knuckles of the mesh (the points where threads cross).|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{classical}} (analog) television transmissions are usually horizontally polarized, because {{in urban areas}} buildings can reflect the electromagnetic waves and create <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> due to multipath propagation. Using horizontal polarization, ghosting is reduced because the amount of reflection of electromagnetic waves in the p polarization (horizontal polarization {{off the side of}} a building) is generally less than s (vertical, in this case) polarization. Vertically polarized analog television has nevertheless been used in some rural areas. In digital terrestrial television such reflections are less problematic, due to robustness of binary transmissions and error correction.|$|E
50|$|A mobile title, Real Zero, was {{released}} in 2004 for FOMA and DoCoMo mobile devices. The game involves users taking pictures of their environments and superimposing <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> somewhere in the frame. Seventy different ghosts were available to collect, with each new ghost triggering the sending of an email to provide clues for finding the next ghost or other messages. The game's service was terminated in 2011. A spin-off for the Nintendo 3DS, Spirit Camera, {{was released}} in all regions in 2012. The story follows a girl named Maya, who is trapped in a haunted house controlled by a mysterious woman in black, and seeks to escape the woman's control.|$|E

50|$|With phosphor-based {{electronic}} displays (for example CRT-type {{computer monitors}} or plasma displays), non-uniform use of pixels, such as prolonged display of non-moving images (text or graphics), gaming, or certain broadcasts with tickers and flags, {{can create a}} permanent ghost-like image of these objects or otherwise degrade image quality. This is because the phosphor compounds which emit light to produce images lose their luminance with use. Uneven usage results in uneven light output over time, and in severe cases can create a ghost image of previous content. Even if <b>ghost</b> <b>images</b> are not recognizable, the effects of screen burn are an immediate and continual degradation of image quality.|$|E
