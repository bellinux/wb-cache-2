40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this paper}} was to present a case with the {{successful}} treatment of <b>decubitis</b> <b>ulcer</b> stage IV in the patient with polytrauma and vertical share pelvic fracture and diagnosed entherocollitis combined with deep wound infection with Clostridium difficile treated with combined Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) and faecal management system. CASE REPORT: Patient D. S. 1967 treated on Traumatology Clinic after tentamen suicide on 9. 2. 2015 with diagnosis: brain contusion; contusion of thoracal space; vertical share pelvic fracture; open fracture type II of the right calcaneus; fracture of the left calcaneus; fracture on the typical place of the left radius; fracture of the right radius with dislocation. As a first step during the treatment in Intensive care unit we perform transcondylar extension of the left leg, and in that time we cannot operate because of the brain contusion. Four weeks after this treatment we intent to perform stabilisation of the pelvic ring, fixation of both arms, and fixation of both calcanear bones. But at the time before performing the saurgery, the patient got an intensive enterocollitis from Escherichia colli and Clostridium difficile, and during the inadequate treatment of enterocollitis she got a big decubitus on both gluteal regia Grade IV and deep muscular necrosis. Several times we perform a necrectomy of necrotic tissue but the wound become bigger and the infection have a progressive intention. In that time we used VAK system for 6 weeks combined with faecal management system and with local necrectomy and system application of Antibiotics and Flagyl for enterocollitis in doses prescripted from specialists from Infective clinic. This new device to manage faecal deep decubital infection and enterocollitis with Clostridium difficile are considered as adequate. 8 Flexi-Seal® FMS has been also used. After two months we succeed to minimize the gluteal wound on quoter from the situation from the beginning and we used for next two months wound treatment from Departement for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. CONCLUSION: When faecal incontinence as a result of enterocollitis with Clostridium difficile does occur, a limiting contact with the patient’s skin is extremely important as breakdown can occur rapidly. In addition to tissue injury, faecal incontinence can {{have a major impact on}} the patient’s dignity and result in prolonged hospital stay. The main outcomes assested in the case studies were resolution of of decubital ulcers as a result of faecal incontinence, patient comfort and ease of application of the FMS and NPWT. The soft flexible catheter was easily inserted without discomfort to the patients. It gently conformed to the rectal vault, reducing significantly the risk of necrosis, and the risk for prolonged necrosis in cases with previously developed necrosis. FMS was successful in diverting faecal fluid away from the perineal tissue and resolved any decubitus ulcer developed previously in combination with use of NPWT. So, we can recommend this combination in those cases especially with polytraumatismus, vertical share pelvis fracture combined with diarrhea and deep wound infection of decubital ulcers Grade IV infected with Cl. difficile...|$|E

Clinical problems related with implanted cardiac device and leads such as pacemaker infections, <b>decubitis</b> <b>ulcers,</b> subclavian venous thrombosis, chronic pain at implantation site necessitating device and lead removal also increased dramatically (Wilkoff et al. 2009). Leads that are implanted less than 1  year may be explanted by simple traction but as implantation duration increases, formation of fibrous capsule around the lead makes extraction procedures difficult and necessitates special devices for lead removal (Esposito et al. 2002) Mechanical extraction systems, laser and radiofrequency devices and auxiliary appereils are needed to get rid of fibrous capsule adhesions around the lead and vascular endothelium (Love 2007; Verma and Wilkoff 2004) In patients when all these methods fail, removal of leads may require open cardiac surgery.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{randomized}} controlled {{study investigated the}} effects of ultrasound and laser treatments on wound healing in rats. The duration of the inflammatory phase decreased with both laser and ultrasound treatments; however, laser was more effec- tive than ultrasound, with more significant results. The prolifera- tion phase showed, for both treatments, {{an increase in the}} level of hydroxyproline and the number of fibroblasts, as well as stimula- tion of the collagen synthesis and the composition. Laser treat- ment was again more effective than ultrasound. The wound breaking strength was significantly higher with both treatments, and no statistically significant difference emerged between the laser and ultrasound groups, although laser treatment provided a much greater increase in the wound breaking strength than ultra- sound. Both treatments have beneficial effects on the inflamma- tory, proliferation, and maturation phases of wound healing. Both can be used successfully for <b>decubitis</b> <b>ulcers</b> and chronic wounds, in conjunction with conventional therapies such as debridement and daily wound caring. However, laser treatment was more effective than ultrasound in the first two phases of wound healing...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of seat cushion has been developed. The present use of the cushion is in {{wheelchair}} seating, but it may ultimately have application to general seating, particularly in situations where comfort is a significant consideration. The cushion is intended to optimally distribute the interface pressure on the seat of a wheelchair user, {{as well as to}} provide an opportunity for active pressure management. The principal goal in developing this cushion is the prevention of pressure sores (<b>decubitis</b> <b>ulcers).</b> The theoretical and design considerations upon which the cushion was developed are presented. Experimental materials data, as well as results of a prototype system, are supplied. A prototype cushion has been produced, and additional work is ongoing. The cushion uses vacuum to manipulate the elastic/collapse properties of open-cell foam; effectively setting a maximum pressure at the human interface. Assuming appropriate auxiliary hardware, pumps, controllers, and sensors it would be appropriate to use this cushion as the basis of an actively controlled seating system. by Michael T. Bush.

40|$|Abstract—We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} electrical stimulation (ES) and laser treatment on wound healing in rats. A randomized-controlled trial, conducted at the Experimental and Clinical Research Centre of Erciyes University (Kayseri, Tur-key), divided 124 healthy female Swiss-Albino rats into four groups. A 6 cm linear incision was made at the dorsal skin of all rats. Group 1 was given a constant direct current of 300 µA for 30 min per day. The current was applied in negative polar-ity for the first 3 days and in positive polarity for the next 7 days. Group 3 received a full-contact, continuous gallium-arsenide (GaAs) laser therapy, with a wavelength of 904 nm, an energy density of 1 J/cm 2, and an average power of 6 mW for 10 min per day. The remaining two groups (Groups 2 and 4) were considered the control groups and received sham treat-ment. All groups were treated for 10 days. Histopathologic and biochemical evaluations were conducted on 10 rats from each group on the 4 th and 10 th days, and wound breaking strength was measured for biomechanical evaluation on the 25 th day of the study. Both ES and laser treatment proved significantly effective in the inflammatory phase compared with control groups (p < 0. 05); however, the ES was even more effective than laser treatment, with more significant results (p < 0. 05). In the proliferation and maturation phases, while ES and laser treatment were both {{found to be significantly}} effective treat-ES and laser treatment can be used successfully in <b>decubitis</b> <b>ulcers</b> and chronic wounds, in combination with conventional therapies such as daily care and debridement of wounds; how-ever, ES has more beneficial effects during the inflammatory phase in some parameters than laser treatment...|$|R
