5|$|The <b>freshwater</b> {{islands in}} Scotland include those within <b>freshwater</b> lochs and rivers – {{including}} tidal areas, so the islands {{may not always}} be surrounded by <b>freshwater.</b> It has been estimated that there are at least 31,460 <b>freshwater</b> lochs in Scotland and that 1.9% of the land surface is covered by fresh waters. The distribution has a north west to south east gradient with the highest concentrations occurring in the islands of the Outer Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|The salt-tolerant {{mangrove}} margin {{has expanded}} inland as <b>freshwater</b> {{flow into the}} bay has been channelized, replacing <b>freshwater</b> sawgrass marshes. The L-31E coastal storm surge levee inland of the park's western boundary has {{played a significant role}} in isolating former <b>freshwater</b> marshlands from their water sources. At the same time, tidal water does not reach the interior of the coastal margin, limiting interchange between salt and <b>freshwater</b> ecosystems.|$|E
40|$|Arsenic {{exists in}} a variety of {{chemical}} forms, and microbial metabolism results in the occurrence of thermodynamically unstable arsenite (As III) and methylarsenic compounds in <b>freshwaters</b> (rivers and lakes). The inorganic forms (As V and As III) and the methylated forms (methylarsonic acid; MMAA V and dimethylarsinic acid; DMAA V) are the main species of As in <b>freshwaters</b> while the bulk of the total dissolved As is inorganic species. Although the predominant forms of methylarsenic compounds are consistently DMAA V followed by MMAA V, the DMAA III and MMAA III species have also been found in <b>freshwaters.</b> Several observations have revealed that phytoplankton activities are responsible for the seasonal variations of methylarsenic compounds in <b>freshwaters.</b> Although it was unclear if the occurrences of methylarsenic compounds were from the breakdown of larger molecules or the end-products of phytoplankton biosynthesis, recent studies have revealed that less toxic As-glutathione complexes are intermediates in the biosynthesis of organoarsenic compounds by phytoplankton. Recent studies have also revealed that eutrophication {{plays an important role in}} the production, distribution, and cycling of methylarsenic compounds in <b>freshwaters.</b> In this review, the recent reports on the influence of eutrophication on distribution, speciation, and bioaccumulation in <b>freshwaters</b> are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{enumeration}} methods {{based on}} the enzymatic hydrolysis of 4 -methylumbelliferyl-β- d-galactoside and 4 -methylumbelliferyl-β- d-glucuronide were optimized for <b>freshwaters.</b> The enzymes β- d-galactosidase (GALase) and β- d-glucuronidase (GLUase) were shown to be already induced in <b>freshwaters</b> when tested, respectively, with the inducers isopropyl-β- d-thiogalactopyranoside and methyl-β- d-glucuronide. Both enzymatic activities were compared, respectively, with plate counts of total and faecal coliforms in <b>freshwaters.</b> Enzymatic methods and reference plate counts were significantly correlated in log–log plots. Moreover, the GLUase method allowed the detection of viable (presenting a detectable GLUase activity) but nonculturable Escherichia coli. FLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5|$|Fish species {{diversity}} is roughly divided equally between marine (oceanic) and <b>freshwater</b> ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific constitute {{the center of}} diversity for marine fishes, whereas continental <b>freshwater</b> fishes are most diverse in large river basins of tropical rainforests, especially the Amazon, Congo, and Mekong basins. More than 5,600 fish species inhabit Neotropical freshwaters alone, such that Neotropical fishes represent about 10% of all vertebrate species on the Earth. Exceptionally rich sites in the Amazon basin, such as Cantão State Park, can contain more <b>freshwater</b> fish species than occur in all of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Mysids have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution and {{are found in}} both marine and <b>freshwater</b> environments, the deep sea, estuaries, shallow coastal waters, lakes, rivers and underground waters. They are primarily marine and fewer than ten percent are found in <b>freshwater.</b> There are about 72 <b>freshwater</b> species in total, being predominantly found in the palearctic and neoptropical zones. These non-marine mysids occur in four distinct types of habitats; some are estuarine species; some were isolated in the Ponto-Caspian Basin where Paramysis has since radiated enormously (23 species); some are glacial relicts and some are subterranean Tethyan relicts.|$|E

In contrast, a few species of <b>freshwater</b> bivalves, including the golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei), are dramatically increasing their ranges. The golden mussel has spread from Southeast Asia to Argentina, where it has become an invasive species. Another well-travelled <b>freshwater</b> bivalve, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) originated in southeastern Russia, and has been accidentally introduced to inland waterways in North America and Europe, where the species damages water installations and disrupts local ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{families}} of crocodilians or their close relatives {{are represented in}} the Maastrichtian fossil records, of which five died out prior to the K–Pg boundary. Five families have both Maastrichtian and Paleocene fossil representatives. All of the surviving {{families of}} crocodyliforms inhabited <b>freshwater</b> and terrestrial environments—except for the Dyrosauridae, which lived in <b>freshwater</b> and marine locations. Approximately 50% of crocodyliform representatives survived across the K–Pg boundary, the only apparent trend being that no large crocodiles survived. Crocodyliform survivability across the boundary may have resulted from their aquatic niche and ability to burrow, which reduced susceptibility to negative environmental effects at the boundary. Jouve and colleagues suggested in 2008 that juvenile marine crocodyliforms lived in <b>freshwater</b> environments as do modern marine crocodile juveniles, which would have helped them survive where other marine reptiles became extinct; <b>freshwater</b> environments were not so strongly affected by the K–Pg extinction event as marine environments were.|$|E
5|$|The Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii) {{is a large}} Australian predatory <b>freshwater</b> fish of the Maccullochella genus and the Percichthyidae family.

The Murray cod is an {{important}} part of Australia's vertebrate wildlife—as an apex predator in the Murray-Darling River system—and also significant in Australia's human culture. The Murray cod is the largest exclusively <b>freshwater</b> fish in Australia, and one of the largest in the world.

There are at least 21 snail and clam species of special concern, including 15 that appear to exist only in single clusters. There are 14 fish species found in the Upper Snake region that do not occur elsewhere in the Columbia's watershed, but which do occur in Bonneville <b>freshwater</b> ecoregion of western Utah, part of the Great Basin and related to the prehistoric Lake Bonneville. The Wood River sculpin (Cottus leiopomus) is endemic to the Wood River.

5|$|There is {{a complex}} of similar <b>freshwater</b> and estuarine Himantura in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australasia that are or were {{tentatively}} identified with H. polylepis. The Australian <b>freshwater</b> Himantura were described as a separate species, H. dalyensis, in 2008. The <b>freshwater</b> Himantura in New Guinea are probably H. dalyensis rather than H. polylepis, though confirmation awaits further study. Trygon fluviatilis from India, as described by Nelson Annandale in 1909, closely resembles and may be conspecific with H. polylepis. On the other hand, comparison of <b>freshwater</b> whipray DNA and amino acid sequences between India and Thailand has revealed significant differences.
