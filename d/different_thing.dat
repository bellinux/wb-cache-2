25|$|Compound {{eyes are}} {{found among the}} {{arthropods}} and are composed of many simple facets which, depending {{on the details of}} anatomy, may give either a single pixelated image or multiple images, per eye. Each sensor has its own lens and photosensitive cell(s). Some eyes have up to 28,000 such sensors, which are arranged hexagonally, and which can give a full 360° field of vision. Compound eyes are very sensitive to motion. Some arthropods, including many Strepsiptera, have compound eyes of only a few facets, each with a retina capable of creating an image, creating vision. With each eye viewing a <b>different</b> <b>thing,</b> a fused image from all the eyes is produced in the brain, providing very different, high-resolution images.|$|E
25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> to raise a gay child, a very <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

500|$|Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker {{writes that}} Hemingway {{learned from his}} short stories how to [...] "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to {{multiply}} intensities, and how to tell {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". The style has become known as the iceberg theory, because, as Baker describes it, in Hemingway's writing the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight. Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices to write about life in general—not only his life. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing though an entirely <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> occurs below the surface.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the novel}} is written in a journalistic style, Frederic Svoboda writes that the {{striking}} thing about the work is [...] "how quickly it moves away from a simple recounting of events." [...] Jackson Benson believes that Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices for life in general. For example, Benson says that Hemingway drew out his experiences with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Hemingway believed that the writer could describe one thing while an entirely <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> occurs below the surface—an approach he called the iceberg theory, or the theory of omission.|$|E
500|$|Because {{he began}} as a writer of short stories, Baker {{believes}} Hemingway learned to [...] "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth." [...] Hemingway called his style the Iceberg Theory: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in [...] "The Big Two-Hearted River") though an entirely <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing {{to the extent that he}} does not have to think about anything else). [...] Paul Smith writes that Hemingway's first stories, collected as In Our Time, showed he was still experimenting with his writing style. He avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences—a childlike syntax without subordination.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was directed by}} Philipp Stölzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles, California in mid-April 2004. Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at me the whole time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'" [...] Lee added that the message of the video is {{in the name of the}} products her character is advertising, each of which are called [...] "Lies" [...] because according to her [...] " [...] whole life is a lie. Every smile, that's a lie." ...|$|E
500|$|Whitehead {{pointed to}} the {{limitations}} of language {{as one of the}} main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking, and acknowledged that {{it may be difficult to}} ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech. [...] After all, each moment of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things, rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> from what it was a moment ago. [...] Yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that [...] "material substances" [...] or [...] "essences" [...] are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular, concrete processes. [...] No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old, and in many ways is not the same person at all; Whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next.|$|E

Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody's playing a <b>different</b> <b>thing.</b> We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day." [...] The album was released in September 1978, reaching number twelve in the UK, and number 69 in the US. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album's [...] "unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse." [...] The album featured the singles [...] "Never Say Die" [...] and [...] "Hard Road", both of which cracked the top 40 in the UK. The band also made their second appearance on Top of the Pops, performing [...] "Never Say Die". It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the US.|$|E

[...] "I like dance music and I like making the music feel good", says Blackman. [...] "To drive an audience of 100,000 into complete oblivion by playing a groove so strong ... I love doing that. I love the chance to show versatility." ...|$|E

Reed's Sir Joseph Porter would jump overboard only to re-enter clutching a rubber life-ring, while ... his Ko-Ko would be found furiously – and anachronistically – pedalling across the stage in a toy car."

2500|$|Arnold's [...] "want {{of logic}} and {{thoroughness}} of thought" [...] {{as noted by}} John M. Robertson in Modern Humanists was {{an aspect of the}} inconsistency of which Arnold was accused. Few of his ideas were his own, and he failed to reconcile the conflicting influences which moved him so strongly. [...] "There are four people, in especial," [...] he once wrote to Cardinal Newman, [...] "from whom I am conscious of having learnt – a very <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> from merely receiving a strong impression – learnt habits, methods, ruling ideas, which are constantly with me; and the four are – Goethe, Wordsworth, Sainte-Beuve, and yourself." [...] Dr. Arnold must be added; the son's fundamental likeness to the father was early pointed out by Swinburne, and was later attested by Matthew Arnold's grandson, Mr. Arnold Whitridge.|$|E

When the [...] "dweller on the threshold" [...] was covered with {{the light of the}} soul or [...] "Angel of Presence" [...] illumination came. Some of these ideas were quoted in the two Morrison compositions, both co-written with Hugh Murphy. In 1982 Morrison revealed in an interview: [...] "I've read Glamour four or five times, and I get different things out of it each time. 's saying a lot of things. It's depth reading.

[...] Producer Jimmy Jam commented, [...] "Between albums she likes to go live life, recharge her batteries {{and be able to}} share her experiences. It not only raises her artistic level, she's able to talk about things she's going through -- and other people can relate. That's {{one of the things that}} allows her to connect truly with the fans." [...] Prior to promotion, Jackson performed a medley of [...] "All for You", [...] "Rhythm Nation", and [...] "The Knowledge" [...] at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show.

2500|$|Hemingway {{started as}} a {{journalist}} and writer of short stories, and Baker suggests that he thus learned how to [...] "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities, and how to tell {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". The style is known as the Iceberg Theory because in Hemingway's writing the hard facts float above water; the supporting structure, complete with symbolism, operates out-of-sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission." [...] Hemingway believed that a writer could describe one thing, while an entirely <b>different</b> <b>thing</b> occurs below the surface. Baker calls Across the River and into the Trees a [...] "lyric-poetical novel" [...] in which each scene has an underlying truth presented via symbolism. According to Meyers, an example of omission is that Renata, like other heroines in Hemingway's fiction, suffers a major [...] "shock"—the murder of her father and the subsequent loss of her home—to which Hemingway alludes only briefly. Hemingway's pared down narrative forces the reader to solve connections—as Stoltzfus has written: [...] "Hemingway walks the reader to the bridge that he or she must cross alone without the narrator's help." ...|$|E
