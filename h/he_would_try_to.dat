5|$|On 1 February 2011, Ian Thorpe {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{qualify for the}} 2012 Olympics in London. Thorpe's major focus was the 100m and 200m freestyle at 2012's trials, stating he could offer the most value to the Australian team in the relays. He would not swim the 400m, claiming {{he would not have}} enough time to build up endurance for that event. This led many to see a renewed rivalry with Michael Phelps.|$|E
5|$|Boyars {{could no}} longer be {{executed}} without the knowledge and approval of the Transylvanian Prince and, if convicted for treason, their fortunes {{could no longer}} be confiscated. Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said in a conversation with the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: …they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but as their own good required and obtained privileges for themselves. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E

5|$|Freed, Desha left Kentucky, {{traveling}} {{down the}} Ohio and Mississippi rivers. According to legend, {{he attempted to}} rob a flatboat skipper near Vicksburg, Mississippi. It happened the skipper was a longtime acquaintance of Desha, named G. W. Crawford. Crawford recognized Desha and asked why <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> rob him. Desha confessed {{that he had been}} living as an outlaw since his father's pardon. Crawford urged Desha to abandon his illegal activities and offered to give him free passage to New Orleans, Louisiana. Desha accepted, telling Crawford that he planned to travel on to a distant place, assume a new name, and seek a fresh start.|$|E
5|$|Before the season, Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri {{remarked that}} Del Piero would have {{as good a}} season, or an even better one, than the {{previous}} term. In August 2008, Del Piero announced that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> keep playing professional football with Juventus until he turned 40. Juventus were drawn into the same Champions League group as Real Madrid, and UEFA Cup winners Zenit Saint Petersburg. Del Piero marked Juventus's return to the competition with a match-winning free kick to seal a home win against Zenit. On 21 October, Del Piero netted a notable goal as Juventus defeated Real Madrid 2–1 in Turin, scoring with a first-time, curling strike from distance, in the fifth minute of play.|$|E
5|$|In October 1980, he {{interacted with}} a {{delegation}} of Solidarity members that included Lech Wałęsa, future President of the Third Republic of Poland. When Wałęsa complained that the Polish government was not keeping to its promise of allowing the independent labour movement enough of an opportunity to publicize itself, Jagielski indicated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> give the movement better access to the Polish press, and to the Polish radio network. Jagielski led a delegation that went to a meeting in Moscow of Comecon, the Eastern Bloc economic community, during January 1981. That month, the government declared that the poor economy was forcing it {{to cut back on}} its promise of ensuring that Polish workers did not have to work on Saturdays, and that it would offer a number of Saturdays as work-free instead.|$|E

5|$|Mehmed {{had decided}} to {{construct}} a fortress {{in what is now}} Elbasan which would provide a perennial base for future Ottoman assaults on Skanderbeg's domains. The fortress especially worried Venice since Elbasan was constructed {{on the banks of the}} Shkumbin River which would allow the Ottomans to send ships into the Adriatic and threaten Venetian colonies. Seeing that his situation had become unfavorable, Skanderbeg made a trip to Italy where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> convince Pope Paul II and Ferdinand I of Naples to give him aid for his war. Despite many promises from the pope, Skanderbeg received little due to the fear of a Neapolitan war with Rome and infighting in the Roman Curia. Ferdinand and the Republic of Venice likewise deferred Skanderbeg's requests to the pope. By the time he left Italy, the League of Lezhë had been weakened and needed his intervention.|$|E
5|$|To placate the Yankees' {{concerns}} about his durability, Rivera followed a {{strength and conditioning}} program in the offseason, instead of throwing. Torre said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> reduce Rivera's workload during the 2003 season to minimize the injury risk to his closer. However, Rivera suffered a groin injury before the season began, causing him to miss the first month. After returning on April 30, he pitched well in the season's first half, saving 16games in 17opportunities. His save on June 12 against the St. Louis Cardinals secured the 300th career win for starter Roger Clemens. Rivera slumped {{early in the second}} half; over one stretch, he blew five of eleven save opportunities, but he rebounded to convert his final 15 of the season. He finished the 2003 regular season with a new career best in ERA (1.66), along with 40saves in 46opportunities. In the 2003 AL Championship Series against the arch-rival Boston Red Sox, Rivera had {{one of the most memorable}} postseason performances of his career; in the decisive Game 7, he entered in the ninth inning with the score tied 5–5 and pitched three scoreless innings, his longest outing since 1996. He became the winning pitcher after Aaron Boone hit an eleventh-inning walk-off home run that clinched the Yankees' series victory and advanced them to the 2003 World Series. Rivera celebrated by running to the pitcher's mound and collapsing in joy to thank God, as Boone rounded the bases and was met by his teammates at home plate. Rivera was named the AL Championship Series MVP for recording two saves and a win in the series. The Yankees lost the World Series to the Florida Marlins; Rivera saved five games and allowed only one earned run in 16innings pitched that postseason.|$|E

25|$|As the {{election}} produced a hung parliament, a multi-party agreement {{was expected to}} be required. Mariano Rajoy said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> form an administration, but Pedro Sánchez called for a change in government, while recognising the PP's right to try and form a government first. Two possible coalitions, the PP with C's and PSOE with Podemos, would both come up short of a majority by themselves.|$|E

He urged that a lumbar puncture be done, with the goal of making a diagnosis, but mainly because Levine believed there could be acute benefit from the procedure.|$|E

25|$|After Eric Schlosser {{finished}} writing Fast Food Nation, reporters {{kept asking}} him about Upton Sinclair, {{and although he}} had read Sinclair's The Jungle, {{he did not know}} about his other works or anything about Sinclair himself. He decided to read most of Sinclair's works, and eventually read the novel Oil!, which he loved. Schlosser, who found the book to be exciting and thought it would make a great film, sought out the Sinclair estate and purchased the film rights. He then thought that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find a director that was as passionate about the book as he was, but Paul Thomas Anderson approached him first.|$|E

Other committee members included president of U.S. Soccer Sunil Gulati, U.S. Soccer chief executive officer Dan Flynn, Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber, and Phil Murphy, the former national finance chairman for the Democratic National Committee.

She was accused of {{extortion}} and denied bail, and was held in a building converted into a jail on the premises of the National Parliament. The Awami League said the arrest was politically motivated. On 17 July 2007, the Anti-Corruption Commission sent notices to both Hasina and Khaleda Zia, instructing them to provide details of their assets to the Commission within one week. Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy {{was out of the}} country, and said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> organise worldwide protest. These arrests of the political leaders were widely seen as a move by the military-backed interim government to force Hasina and Zia out of the country and into political exile. United Kingdom MPs condemned the arrest.|$|E

25|$|Assistant Attorney General John Doar {{and former}} Florida Governor LeRoy Collins, {{representing}} President Lyndon Johnson, went to Selma {{to meet with}} King and others at Richie Jean Jackson's house and privately urged King to postpone the march. The SCLC president told them that his conscience demanded that he proceed, and that many movement supporters, especially in SNCC, would {{go ahead with the}} march even if he told them it should be called off. Collins suggested to King that he make a symbolic witness at the bridge, then turn around and lead the marchers back to Selma. King told them that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> enact the plan provided that Collins could ensure that law enforcement would not attack them. Collins obtained this guarantee from Sheriff Clark and Al Lingo in exchange for a guarantee that King would follow a precise route drawn up by Clark.|$|E

After the PSOE-C's accord was announced, the PP reluctantly withdrew its candidate due to lack of support from other parties, while Podemos proposed Carolina Bescansa for the post, gathering the support of IU. The next week, King Felipe VI started a round of talks with the different political parties in order to nominate a candidate for Prime Minister—a formateur. Rajoy initially announced <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> pass the investiture vote despite not having the support from any other party aside from his own, while Albert Rivera stated his will to try to mediate between PP and PSOE so that an agreement could be reached.|$|E
