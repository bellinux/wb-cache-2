40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} of the simulation for high speed cutting is usually based on 2 D modeling by now, and the 3 D simulation is few. Because the cutting process is a 3 D deformation of workpiece, it’s {{badly in need of}} the research on 3 D finite element simulation of cutting process for further reveal the mechanism of high speed cutting. The 3 D simulation of <b>inclined</b> <b>cutting</b> of hardened 45 steel(45 HRC) is carried out base on ABAQUS. The forming process of serrated chip is simulated by adopting the Johnson-cook material modeling and separation criterion of shear failure. The change of chip morphology, chip flow angle and deformation coefficient of width under different rake angle and cutting depth are analyzed. The results show that the segment degree of chip becomes larger with the decrease of rake angle and increase of cutting depth. The chip flow angle is not effected by rake angle and its value is approximately equal to tool cutting edge inclination angle, an it increases with the increase of cutting depth. The deformation coefficient of width increase with the decrease of rake angle and increase of cutting depth...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{undesired}} self-excited chatter vibrations in milling is very common. However, {{only in the}} last two decades some significant achievements for the theoretical understanding of this intricate phenomenon have been accomplished. Nevertheless, state of the art dynamic models are still not able to completely explain milling dynamics and chatter onset during some conventional milling operations performed by conventional cutting tools. In this research work, a revolutionary model of tooling system dynamics and of the regenerative effect in milling will be presented. The new model introduces a significant correction to the predicted stability borders when the cutter diameter is relatively large in comparison with tooling system overhang and when curved or <b>inclined</b> <b>cutting</b> edges are applied. Accordingly, the new approach may be of great interest for many industrial applications. The model has been successfully validated by performing experimental modal analysis, cutting force coefficient identification and stability lobes diagram determination, through many specific cutting tests. In the considered case study, where the afore mentioned geometrical features of the tooling system were still moderate, a significant shift of the stability borders of about + 25 % was experimentally observed and correctly predicted by the new approach...|$|E
40|$|An {{empirical}} {{and theoretical}} investigation was achieved on a cylindrical storage collector. It was suggested {{in this work}} for a cylinder to be cut at an <b>inclined</b> <b>cutting</b> plane. The tests were achieved for both summer and winter climate conditions with and without hot water removal. The hourly system performance parameters were investigated systematically for different experiments. These included the average storage temperature, velocity distribution, and temperature distribution. In the cylindrical collector, the ultimate magnitude of the average storage temperature was 25  °C, while the maximum temperature {{at the tip of}} the cylindrical collector was 58  °C for a typical spring day. Meanwhile, the rectangular collector can warm up the stored water to a temperature of 23  °C, when the inlet water temperature was 12  °C. The performance of the new solar collector was, in general, similar to the performance of the conventional thermosyphon flat plate solar water heaters. The Fluent program was used to confirm the experimental results. The free convection in the cylindrical collector was investigated based on the method of control volume. From the Fluent data and analysis of the collector, the temperature and velocity distributions throughout the day were obtained. The Fluent program data was well compatible with the experimental results...|$|E

30|$|Some {{studies have}} {{investigated}} relationship of chip types to the resultant cutting force [15, 16], although {{the relation between}} the types and surface quality is not deeply discussed in these studies. Franz [12, 13] mentioned that the machined surface produced in type II chip formation is so-called of good quality. However, Franz has not conducted type 0 chip formation and it is unknown whether type II is superior or not to type 0 in terms of the surface quality. McKenzie et al. [17] conducted both <b>inclined</b> and orthogonal <b>cutting,</b> and found that changes in the occurrence of chip type induced by the inclination affect the surface quality. However, only the occurrence of defects such as raised grain or torn grain on the surface has been checked in their study, so it is uncertain whether the compressed cells, which Scholz et al. [1] mentioned, appear or not on and beneath the machined surface of each chip type.|$|R
25|$|The railway on Lord Elgin's works, between Dunfermline and Limekilns in Fife, {{for design}} and execution, is {{inferior}} to none. On {{this line of}} railway there are two inclined planes, executed with all the requisite machinery, for the loaded waggons drawing up the empty ones; the longest of these is about 511 yards, with a declivity of about one in twenty. Between the two inclined planes, the ground had been originally nearly level to some extent: an ingenious advantage is taken of this level, by commencing, at {{a short distance from}} the foot of the upper <b>inclined</b> plane, and <b>cutting</b> out a track for a railway, with an easy slope in the line of the main descending railway for the loaded waggons, by banking up the earth, and facing it with a stone-wall; another railway is formed with a similar slope, but in a contrary direction, towards the foot of the upper inclined plane. In this manner the two railways are carried forward until they reach the top or bank-head of the under inclined plane, where the difference of perpendicular height between the two appears to be about 10 feet; the one-half of this height gives a declivity to the loaded waggons to proceed downwards; and the other half a declivity to the empty waggons, to proceed {{to the foot of the}} upper inclined plane: the brake or drag of the loaded waggons has only to be attended to, for regulating their motion to the place where they start on the inclined plane.|$|R
40|$|The thesis report {{presents}} {{the designs of}} compact planar ultra-wideband (UWB) antennas for wireless devices applications. Three main designs of UWB antennas are studied, namely, single UWB antennas, UWB multiple-input-multiple-out(MIMO) antennas, and transparent UWB antennas on the screens of mobile phones. For single UWB antennas, the designs of two compact planar monopole antennas with compact sizes of 26 × 28 mm 2 and 30 × 39. 3 mm 2 are presented. The UWB operations of the antennas are achieved using a ground slot under the feed line, offsetting the feed line and the radiator {{from the middle of}} the ground plane and smoothly transforming the feed line. Simulation and measurement show that the two antennas can achieve an ultra-wide bandwidth with approximately omnidirectional patterns. A deep notch-band in 5. 1 - 5. 85 GHz is created in one of the UWB antennas by employing two pairs of meander lines (MLs), one pair being close to the feed line and the other pair along the upper edge of the ground plane. At the notch frequency, the simulated efficiency is only 4 %. Three compact UWB-MIMO antennas with very compact sizes of 26 × 40 〖mm〗^ 2, 21 × 38 〖mm〗^ 2, and 22 × 36 〖mm〗^ 2 are designed. Each of them is designed using two UWB antenna elements perpendicularly or symmetrically placed. Different techniques such as using ground stubs besides the radiators, <b>cutting</b> <b>inclined</b> slots on the ground, and adding a T-shaped protruding from ground are proposed to lower mutual coupling between the two antenna elements. One of the antennas is designed to generate a notched band in 5. 15 - 5. 85 GHz using two ground strips. Simulation and measurement results show that these antennas can cover the entire UWB of 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz with mutual coupling of less than - 15 dB, and envelope correlation coefficient of less than 0. 1. An UWB antenna is designed using a transparent conductive film for applications on mobile phone screens. The effects of a finger touching the screen are studied. Results show that, with the radiator on the bottom side of the screen and a thin film with a thickness of 0. 05 mm on the top side to separate the finger and the antenna, the effects of the finger can be minimized. In measurement of monopole antennas with small ground planes, due to the feeding cable used, there are always discrepancies between the simulated and measured results in radiation patterns, efficiencies, and gains at lower frequencies. To verify that the discrepancies in the results of these studies are indeed due to the feeding cable used in measurement, the models of the feeding cables are developed and used for simulation. Results show that, by using the cable model, the simulated and measured results in radiation patterns, efficiencies, and gains agree very well. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
