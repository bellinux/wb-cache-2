5|$|Janus and Epimetheus {{are called}} co-orbital moons. They are of roughly <b>equal</b> <b>size,</b> with Janus being {{slightly}} larger than Epimetheus. Janus and Epimetheus have orbits {{with only a few}} kilometers difference in semi-major axis, close enough that they would collide if they attempted to pass each other. Instead of colliding, however, their gravitational interaction causes them to swap orbits every four years.|$|E
5|$|Such {{large-scale}} {{interactions are}} rare. As time passes, mergers of two systems of <b>equal</b> <b>size</b> become less common. Most bright galaxies have remained fundamentally unchanged {{for the last}} few billion years, and the net rate of star formation probably also peaked approximately ten billion years ago.|$|E

5|$|There {{is another}} {{concrete}} definition of evenness: if {{the objects in}} a set can be placed into two groups of <b>equal</b> <b>size,</b> then the number of objects is even. This definition {{is equivalent to the}} first one. Again, zero is even because the empty set can be divided into two groups of zero items each.|$|E
5|$|The Church of St Nicholas lies in {{the centre}} of Sapareva Banya. Its {{architecture}} is rather simple, with a single nave, a single apse and no narthex present. The church follows the Byzantine cross-in-square design, with unusually short arms of <b>equal</b> <b>size.</b> The dome has twelve sides and is of no particular height, though it is rather large for the church's size. The apse is situated on the church's eastern side; its shape is semicircular and it features a window. The entrance {{is located on the}} west wall.|$|E

5|$|A typical {{cemetery}} {{is surrounded}} by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought-iron gate entrance. For cemeteries in France and Belgium, a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments. All but the smallest cemeteries contain a register with an inventory of the burials, a plan of the plots and rows, and a basic history of the cemetery. The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery. More recently, in larger sites, a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign. The headstones within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of <b>equal</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to protocol, {{the flag}} may fly from sunrise until sunset; {{businesses}} and schools {{are permitted to}} fly the flag from opening to closing. When flying the flags of Japan and another country at the same time, the Japanese flag takes the position of honor and {{the flag of the}} guest country flies to its right. Both flags must be at the same height and of <b>equal</b> <b>size.</b> When more than one foreign flag is displayed, Japan's flag is arranged in the alphabetical order prescribed by the United Nations. When the flag becomes unsuitable to use, it is customarily burned in private. The Law Regarding the National Flag and Anthem does not specify on how the flag should be used, but different prefectures came up with their own regulations to use the Hinomaru and other prefectural flags.|$|E

5|$|An aggressive, {{powerful}} apex predator, the {{silvertip shark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of bony fishes, as well as eagle rays, smaller sharks, and cephalopods. This species dominates other requiem sharks of <b>equal</b> <b>size</b> when competing for food, and larger individuals are often heavily scarred from conflicts with others of its species. As with other members of its family, the silvertip shark is viviparous, with females giving birth to one to 11 pups in the summer. Silvertip sharks are regarded as potentially dangerous to humans, as they often approach divers quite closely. This slow-reproducing species is taken by commercial fisheries for its meat, fins, skin, cartilage, and jaws and teeth, which has apparently led to local population declines or extirpations.|$|E
5|$|During group interactions, Galapagos {{sharks are}} {{dominant}} to blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) but deferent to silvertip sharks (C. albimarginatus) of <b>equal</b> <b>size.</b> When confronted or cornered, the Galapagos shark may perform a threat display {{similar to that}} of the grey reef shark, in which the shark performs an exaggerated, rolling swimming motion while arching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, puffing out its gills, and gaping its jaw. The shark may also swing its head from side to side, so as to keep the perceived threat within its field of vision. A known parasite of the Galapagos shark is the flatworm Dermophthirius carcharhini, which attaches to the shark's skin. In one account, a bluefin trevally (Caranax melampygus) was seen rubbing against the rough skin of a Galapagos shark to rid itself of parasites.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{scientists}} {{described the}} first known extensive dromaeosaurid trackway, in Shandong, China. In addition to confirming {{the hypothesis that the}} sickle-claw was held retracted off the ground, the trackway (made by a large, Achillobator-sized species) showed evidence of six individuals of about <b>equal</b> <b>size</b> moving together along a shoreline. The individuals were spaced about one meter apart, and retained the same direction of travel, walking at a fairly slow pace. The authors of the paper describing these footprints interpreted the trackways as evidence that some species of dromaeosaurids lived in groups. While the trackways clearly do not represent hunting behavior, the idea that groups of dromaeosaurids may have hunted together, according to the authors, could not be ruled out.|$|E

50|$|While the {{numerical}} limits for ownership {{were supported by}} the court, {{the fact that they}} simply retained the existing numerical limits was not. Both sides had issue with this, as the believed that it did not follow the reasoning of other steps the commission took, nor fit the mission of establishing five <b>equal</b> <b>sized</b> ownership groups for competitive reasons. The court remanded this decision, and asked for additional justification. The court also remanded the very thinking of the goal to achieve five <b>equal</b> <b>sized</b> competitors. It agreed both with the deregulation groups that claimed that evidence showed no actual or potential for <b>equal</b> <b>sized</b> competitors, as well as the Citizen Petitioners who showed that five competitors was incongruent with the Department of Justice’s definition of competition. Since the FCC had used the DOJ standards to justify the television limits it imposed, it was deemed irrational to then ignore DOJ rules for radio limits.|$|R

5|$|The first entity {{to use the}} Italian tricolour was the Cisalpine Republic in 1797, which supplanted Milan after Napoleon's victorious army crossed Italy in 1796. The colours {{chosen by}} the Cispadane Republic were red and white, which were the colours of the {{recently}} conquered flag of Milan; and green, which was the colour of the uniform of the Milanese civic guard. During this time, many small French-proxy republics of Jacobin inspiration supplanted the ancient absolute Italian states and almost all, with variants of colour, used flags characterised by three bands of <b>equal</b> <b>size,</b> clearly inspired by the French model of 1790.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the finless sleeper ray is oval in shape; it is slightly wider than long in adults, and circular or longer than wide in juveniles. The small and bulging eyes are immediately followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles of roughly <b>equal</b> <b>size.</b> A pair of kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{beneath the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. A curtain of skin, reaching the mouth, is present between the small, circular nostrils. The nostrils are connected to the corners of the mouth by a pair of grooves. The small mouth is gently arched and protrusible. The flattened teeth have hexagonal bases and are arranged into narrow bands. There are five pairs of short gill slits.|$|E
5|$|Though silvertip {{sharks are}} quite mobile, they exhibit {{fidelity}} to certain areas {{and there are}} reports of territorial behavior. They are usually encountered alone or in pairs. Small groups of adult females have been seen in deep water. Individual silvertip sharks behave very aggressively towards one another, and many are heavily scarred. They are also reported to dominate Galapagos sharks (C. galapagensis) and blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) of <b>equal</b> <b>size</b> when competing for food. This shark sometimes forms mixed-species aggregations with grey reef sharks. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against silvertip sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites. They sometimes follow marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in open water, and are themselves followed by pilot fish (Naucrates ductor).|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Suoi Chau Pha (6 August 1967) {{was fought}} during the Vietnam War between Australian {{troops and the}} Viet Cong. The battle took place during Operation Ballarat, an Australian search and destroy {{operation}} in the eastern Hat Dich area, north-west of Nui Dat in Phuoc Tuy province. Following a covert insertion the day before which had caught a number of Viet Cong sentries by surprise, A Company, 7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (7 RAR) had patrolled forward unaware {{of the presence of}} a large Viet Cong main force unit nearby. Clashing with a reinforced company from the Viet Cong 3rd Battalion, 274th Regiment, a classic encounter battle ensued between two forces of roughly <b>equal</b> <b>size.</b> Fought at close quarters in dense jungle amid a heavy monsoon rain, both sides suffered heavy casualties as neither was able to gain an advantage. Finally, after a battle lasting several hours, the Australian artillery proved decisive and the Viet Cong were forced to withdraw, dragging many of their dead from the battlefield after having suffered crippling losses.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Plateosaurus {{is small and}} narrow, {{rectangular}} in side view, and nearly three times {{as long as it}} is high. There is an almost rectangular lateral temporal foramen at the back. The large, round orbit (eye socket), the sub-triangular antorbital fenestra and the oval naris (nostril) are of almost <b>equal</b> <b>size.</b> The jaws carried many small, leaf-shaped, socketed teeth: 5 to 6 per premaxilla, 24 to 30 per maxilla, and 21 to 28 per dentary (lower jaw). The thick, leaf-shaped, bluntly serrated tooth crowns were suitable for crushing plant material. The low position of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage, so that Plateosaurus could deliver a powerful bite. These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants. Its eyes were directed to the sides, rather than the front, providing all-round vision to watch for predators. Some fossil skeletons have preserved sclerotic rings (rings of bone plates that protect the eye).|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} pelvic fins {{are much}} longer than wide; adult males have claspers that extend past the pelvic fin rear tips. The broad and flattened tail is about a quarter longer than the disc and bears prominent skin folds along both sides. There are two dorsal fins of roughly <b>equal</b> <b>size</b> and shape, with the first originating over the rear tips of the pelvic fins. The tail terminates in a low caudal fin; the upper caudal fin lobe is somewhat angular, especially in adult males, while the lower lobe is rounded. The skin often bears creases and is devoid of dermal denticles. The Tasmanian numbfish is plain dark brown above, becoming lighter on the fins. The underside is white, sometimes with a few dark blotches. Many juveniles also exhibit a darker midline stripe along the back, along with darker blotches over the disc and at the dorsal fin bases.|$|E
