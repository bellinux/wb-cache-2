25|$|ISO 8601 Data {{elements}} and interchange formats – Information interchange – Representation of <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> <b>times</b> {{is an international}} standard covering the exchange of <b>date</b> <b>and</b> time-related data. It was issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and {{was first published in}} 1988. The purpose of this standard is to provide an unambiguous and well-defined method of representing <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> <b>times,</b> so as to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> <b>times,</b> particularly when data are transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> <b>times.</b>|$|R

5|$|Brawl {{contains}} 41selectable stages, 29 {{of which}} are initially available. Many stages undergo elaborate changes while battles take place, such as a cycling day-to-night system and changing seasons. A stage based on the Animal Crossing series features a live events system in which special events may occur depending on the <b>date</b> <b>and</b> <b>time.</b> Environmental gameplay mechanics are featured in this installment, such as destructible terrain {{and the ability to}} float. Unlike its predecessors, Brawl includes stages based on third-party games such as the Metal Gear Solid-inspired Shadow Moses Island. The game also includes stages taken from its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee.|$|E
5|$|The {{show was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to take}} place 20 March 2016, however, after {{it was announced that}} President Barack Obama was scheduled to arrive on the same day, concerns were raised and {{the decision was made to}} reschedule the concert to 25 March 2016. Shortly before the rescheduled concert date, Pope Francis attempted to delay it, asking that the band play on a later date as the concert was scheduled for 25 March 2016, which was Good Friday, a major and solemn Christian holiday. The Vatican also suggested that the band delay the start of their concert until midnight to avoid the holy day. However, the Stones opted to play the concert at the originally scheduled <b>date</b> <b>and</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

5|$|The table {{contains}} the <b>date</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> {{of the greatest}} eclipse (in dynamical time, {{which in this case}} is the time when the axis of the Moon's shadow cone passes closest to the centre of Earth; this is in Universal Time). The number of the saros series that the eclipse belongs to is given, followed by the magnitude of the eclipse (the fraction of the Sun's diameter obscured by the Moon) and the type of the eclipse (either total, annular, partial or hybrid). For total and annular eclipses, the duration of the eclipse is given, as well as the location of the greatest eclipse (the point of maximum eclipse) and the path width of the total or annular eclipse. The geographical areas from which the eclipse can be seen are listed.|$|E
5|$|If the <b>date</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> of any {{solar eclipse}} are known, it is {{possible}} to predict other eclipses using eclipse cycles. The saros is probably the best known {{and one of the most}} accurate. A saros lasts 6,585.3 days (a little over 18 years), which means that, after this period, a practically identical eclipse will occur. The most notable difference will be a westward shift of about 120° in longitude (due to the 0.3 days) and a little in latitude (north-south for odd-numbered cycles, the reverse for even-numbered ones). A saros series always starts with a partial eclipse near one of Earth's polar regions, then shifts over the globe through a series of annular or total eclipses, and ends with a partial eclipse at the opposite polar region. A saros series lasts 1226 to 1550 years and 69 to 87 eclipses, with about 40 to 60 of them being central.|$|E

40|$|The {{first thing}} {{that you need to}} know is that SAS ® {{software}} stores <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> <b>times</b> as numbers. However, this is not the only thing that you need to know, and this presentation will give you a solid base for working with <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> <b>times</b> in SAS. It will also introduce you to functions and features that will enable you to manipulate your <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> <b>times</b> with surprising flexibility. This paper will also {{show you some of the}} possible pitfalls with <b>dates</b> (<b>and</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> datetimes) in your SAS code, and how to avoid them. We’ll show how the SAS System handles <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> <b>times</b> through examples, <b>and</b> close with a discussion of Excel conversions. WHAT’S THE FIRST THING I NEED TO KNOW? The first thing is of course that the SAS System stores <b>dates,</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> datetimes as numbers. Dates are counted in days from a zero point of January 1, 1960. Times are counted in seconds from a zero point of midnight of the current day, and datetimes are counted in seconds since midnight, January 1, 1960. Each day that passes increments the day counter by 1, and each second that passes increments the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> datetime counters by 1. This makes it easy to calculate durations in days and seconds. Unfortunately, most references to <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> <b>times</b> do not use the lowest common denominator of days and seconds, respectively, and they certainly don’t use January 1, 1960 and midnight as their central references. That’s where the first problem comes up: how to get SAS to speak about <b>dates</b> <b>and</b> <b>times</b> the way we do. How do you tell SAS that the date is January 14, 1967...|$|R
