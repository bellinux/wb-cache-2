Kim accused Minaj of copying her image saying, [...] "If {{you are going to}} steal my swag, you gonna have to pay. Something gotta give. You help me, I help you. That's how it goes to me." [...] Minaj's single [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] with Eminem was {{believed}} to be a response to Kim's comments, although she later denied this, she responded to the situation in an interview with HOT 97's Angie Martinez saying, [...] "She picked a fight with Foxy, then she picked a fight with Eve, then she picked a fight with Remy, then it was Mrs. Wallace, then it was Nicki Minaj. Every time you in the news, it's 'cause you gettin' at somebody! Where's your music? Put your music out, and when <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> name on Billboard, that's when I'll respond to you. Other than that, goodbye. It's Barbie, bitch." [...] Lil' Kim reignited the feud with the release of her mixtape Black Friday (the title of which directly referenced Minaj). The artwork portrays Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword. A fragment of a diss track called [...] "Tragedy" [...] was released in response by Minaj in April 2011. Following the release of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, critics suggested that the track [...] "Stupid Hoe" [...] may have contained attacks directed at Kim. Lil' Kim later suggested in an interview with 105's Breakfast Club that the song [...] "Automatic" [...] was similar to her unreleased material, also calling Minaj [...] "obnoxious" [...] and [...] "catty".|$|E

2500|$|Pauline Curuenavuli {{was born}} in Suva, Fiji on 15 October 1982 to parents Isireli, a former choir conductor, and Miliana, a nurse. Her mother Miliana lived and worked alone in Sydney, Australia for two years. Paulini, her five {{siblings}} and their father Isireli moved from Fiji to Sydney in 1986, when she was four years old, to join Miliana. Their first home in Australia was a two-bedroom apartment in Randwick, New South Wales, where Paulini attended Coogee Public School. The family later moved to a South-western Sydney suburb, close to the Fijian church they regularly attended. Paulini is the youngest of six siblings; she has three brothers and two sisters. Paulini's eldest brother {{was shot and killed}} during a robbery incident in 1990. She recorded a cover of Luba's [...] "Every Time <b>I</b> <b>See</b> <b>Your</b> Picture I Cry", in her brother's memory, for her third album Come Alive (2015). Paulini and her family began singing and playing instruments from a young age, despite not being classically trained in music. Their father taught Paulini and her siblings how to harmonise. At the age of 10, Paulini's father encouraged her to showcase her singing abilities at a church talent quest. It was during this moment Paulini realised that singing is [...] "what I wanted to do with my life." [...] Aside from singing, Paulini also had a passion for playing netball.|$|E

I told him, 'Can <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>your</b> license?' And then, {{he told me he had}} a firearm. I told him not to reach for it and (sigh) when he went down to grab, I told him not to reach for it (clears throat) and then he kept it right there, and I told him to take his hands off of it, and then he (sigh) he had his, his grip a lot wider than a wallet .... And I don't know where the gun was, he didn't tell me where the fucking gun was, and then it was just getting hinky, he gave, he was just staring ahead, and then I was getting fucking nervous, and then I told him, I know I fucking told him to get his fucking hand off his gun.According to the official Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) transcript of the interview of Yanez and his attorneys Tom Kelly and Robert Fowler, Yanez stated that his justification for the shooting was based on fear for his own life because he believed that Castile's behavior was abusive toward a young girl passenger (Reynolds' daughter) in the car. Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?" [...] The victims' previous marijuana use later became a focus of the defense, with a mason jar containing a small amount having been found in the car.|$|E
