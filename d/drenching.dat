5|$|Designed {{within the}} tight 35,000 ton {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, wartime service necessitated increases over the design displacement, seriously reducing freeboard and affecting seaworthiness. This was most acute at the already low bow. With too little buoyancy forward the bows were easily buried even in moderate seas, with spray washing up over both forward turrets. Heavy seas could flood ‘A’ turret, <b>drenching</b> both men and machinery within.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of oxamyl in controlling Heterodera schachtii on cabbage {{was determined by}} applying various contbinations of soil <b>drenches</b> at 6. 7 kg (a. i.) /ha and foliar sprays at 0. 04 kg (a. i.) / 100 liters of water to cabbage seedlings. Pretransplant <b>drenches</b> provided some control of H. schachtii over a 13 -week period. A single foliar spray of oxamyl 1 week before transplanting apparently prevented penetration of H. schachtii larvae; post-transplant sprays were relatively ineffective. A pretransplant or transplant <b>drench</b> combined with a foliar application 2 weeks after transplanting provided the most effective control. The effectiveness of <b>drenches</b> plus post-transplant sprays is {{probably due to the}} spray augmenting the action of the <b>drench</b> in inhibiting the development of larvae after penelration...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of three methods for delivery of four endophytic Bacillus into tomato root, stem and leaves tissues was studied in greenhouse conditions at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou. The delivery methods included seed treatment+soil <b>drench,</b> soil <b>drench</b> and foliar spray. The endophytic bacteria was previously isolated from tomato rhizosphere and reinoculated and recovered after treatments from tomato CV. Hezou. Seed treatment+soil <b>drench</b> and soil <b>drench</b> methods of application led to establishment and recovery of endophytic bacteria from root tissues but foliar spray no bacteria were detected from roots. All the isolates were recovered from stem {{by the three}} delivery method except B 8 was not detected by foliar spray method. From the leaves all isolates were detected by foliar spray method but only B 2 and B 7 were detected by seed treatment+soil <b>drench</b> method and B 2 only detected by soil <b>drench</b> method. The seed treatment+soil <b>drench</b> was the most efficient method to deliver endophytic bacteria into tomato tissues. All the isolates in the three methods of application were enhanced the growth of tomato and reduced wilt infection with varied degrees among the isolates and methods of delivery. The results demonstrated that endophytic bacteria can be recovered from tomato tissues following inoculation by different methods described, but the delivery depends on the methods used and the endophytic bacteria isolate...|$|R

5|$|Tropical Depression Eleven {{formed in}} the Bay of Campeche on August 22. Later in the day it {{strengthened}} into Tropical Storm Jose over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and achieved a maximum strength of 60mph (95km/h) before it made landfall {{in the state of}} Veracruz, Mexico on August 23. It then rapidly weakened and soon dissipated as it moved inland over Mexico. While <b>drenching</b> Mexico's Gulf coast, Jose forced some 25,000 residents from their homes in Veracruz state.

40|$|Various {{concentrations}} of Alar (Daminozide), Chlormequat (Cycocel) and Paclobutrazol (Cultar) as spray, <b>drench</b> and {{combination of both}} <b>drench</b> and spray applications were tried on two cultivars of pot grown alstroemeria to study their effect on plant height, spread, and other flowering parameters in a factorial completely randomised block design under glasshouse conditions at Mashobra which were evaluated during two successive flushes in the year 2003 - 2005. Both the cultivars viz Selection No- 14 and Riana responded favourably to retardant treatments. A height reduction of 31. 5 per cent in the first flush was recorded with Alar (1500 ppm) spray whereas a combination <b>drench</b> and spray application of Alar (1500 ppm) resulted in 28 per cent height reduction in the second flush. Cultivar Riana in the second flush resulted in maximum height reduction and also produced maximum spread. Cultivar Selection No- 14 took minimum days to bud formation, produced greater number of cymes per inflorescence in second flush and responded with a better pot presentability than cv Riana which remained in flowering for maximum duration in both the flushes. Significant reduction in days to bud formation was recorded with PP 333 (50 ppm) <b>drench</b> and spray in the first flush. A marked positive effect of PP 333 (50 ppm) <b>drench</b> and spray along with Alar (1500 ppm) <b>drench</b> and spray was observed on number of cymes per inflorescence in the first flush whereas in the second flush, Cycocel (1500 ppm) <b>drench</b> and spray resulted in maximum number of cymes per inflorescence. All the treatments significantly increased duration of flowering and pot presentability in both flushes, with spray application of Alar (1500 ppm) coupled with <b>drench</b> and spray application of Cycocel (1500 ppm) and PP 333 (50 ppm) producing the best results...|$|R

5|$|Fighting {{continued}} {{between the}} North Koreans and the ROK Capital Division {{on the hills}} bordering the valley from An'gang-ni to Kyongju. The 3rd Battalion, US 19th Infantry, became involved there just after midnight on September 8–9. A North Korean force attacked K Company and drove it from Hill 300, a defensive position midway between An'gang-ni and Kyongju. North Koreans held the hill during September 9 against counterattack. Farther north, {{on the left side}} of the valley, the ROK 17th Regiment attacked and, with the support of the US 13th Field Artillery Battalion, captured Hill 285 and held it against several North Korean counterattacks. On the opposite, east side of the valley the ROK 18th Regiment made limited gains. These battles took place in <b>drenching</b> typhoon rains. Low-hanging clouds allowed very little air support.

5|$|Under {{pressure}} from his {{director and the}} exhibit's drug manufacturer sponsor, Burton steals Zero's medical records in hopes of discovering new information. Zero and Burton examine an old blood sample of Zero's under a microscope and discover Miss HIV (Michael Callen), who {{points out that the}} original study that was used to label Patient Zero as the first person to bring HIV to North America did not prove any such thing, but instead helped prove that HIV was sexually transmitted, leading to the development of safer sex practices. Under this interpretation, Zero could be lauded as a hero for his candor in participating in that original study. As Burton ponders this, an unknown fluid squirts from the eye pieces of the microscope, <b>drenching</b> Zero and making him appear on video. He joyously declares his innocence on tape but the effect only lasts five minutes before he fades away again. Zero angrily accuses Burton of not caring for him at all and only wanting to use him for the exhibit, then storms out.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{have also}} been experimenting with other methods, such as fumigation, injecting the mound, mound <b>drenching,</b> and surface dusting. Mound <b>drenching</b> entails pouring large volumes of toxic liquid into the mound. While this may affect {{a large portion of}} the mound, it is {{possible}} it may not reach the queen, thus preventing the destruction of the colony. Surface dusting is similar to mound <b>drenching,</b> except insecticides are applied on top of the mound and soak into the soil when wet. Mound injections use pressurising and injecting insecticides into the mound, but the queen may not be affected by this. Mounds can be eliminated effectively through fumigation. Broadcast treatment is sometimes used by spraying infected areas with agricultural equipment. Finally, spot treatment with insecticides can be used by drilling and injecting the mound with residual insecticide.|$|E
