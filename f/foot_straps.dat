5000|$|Sandboarding is a boardsport {{similar to}} snowboarding.It is a {{recreational}} activity and {{takes place on}} sand dunes rather than snow-covered mountains.It involves riding across or down a dune while standing with both <b>feet</b> <b>strapped</b> to a board, though some sandboarders use a board without bindings.|$|R
40|$|A pad is {{disclosed}} {{for use in}} a {{weighing system}} for weighing a load. The pad includes a weighing platform, load cells, and foot members. Improvements to the pad reduce or substantially eliminate rotation of {{one or more of the}} corner foot members. A flexible <b>foot</b> <b>strap</b> disposed between the corner foot members reduces rotation of the respective foot members about vertical axes through the corner foot members and couples the corner foot members such that rotation of one corner foot member results in substantially the same amount of rotation of the other comer foot member. In a strapless variant one or more fasteners prevents substantially all rotation of a foot member. In a diagonal variant, a <b>foot</b> <b>strap</b> extends between a corner foot member and the weighing platform to reduce rotation of the foot member about a vertical axis through the comer foot member...|$|R
5000|$|Surfstyle: Wave riding using surfboards. Ideal {{conditions}} are cross shore to cross offshore {{with the wind}} blowing {{in the same direction}} that the wave is breaking. Boards can be ridden with or without <b>foot</b> <b>straps.</b>|$|E
50|$|Waveski surfing is {{a dynamic}} sport {{combining}} the paddle power of a sit on top kayak with the manoeuvrability and performance of a surfboard. A Waveski resembles a larger surfboard, {{with the addition of}} a seat, fins, <b>foot</b> <b>straps,</b> and seat belt, enabling the rider to 'eskimo roll' if overturned. The waveski rider or waveski surfer uses a double ended kayak paddle for motion while seated in the waveski.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the ways}} to bond or {{electrically}} connect personnel to ground is the use of an ESD garment. ESD garments have conductive threads in them, creating a wearable version of a faraday cage. ESD garments attempt to shield ESD sensitive devices from harmful static charges from clothing such as wool, silk, and synthetic fabrics on people working with them. For these garments to work properly, they must also be connected to ground with a strap. Most ESD garments are not conductive enough to provide personal grounding so antistatic <b>foot</b> <b>straps</b> and antistatic wrist straps are also worn. ESD garments are considered an optional method to control ESD.|$|E
50|$|The model {{provides}} a contoured orthopedic rubber sole with synthetic upper, and {{was designed as}} an après-sport slide, but the adilette were quickly used everywhere out of the sporting world. Opting for a wide, over the <b>foot</b> <b>strap</b> rather than the design of flip flops, the adilette sandals provide a fresh style and a different level of comfort for the wearer. The strap is also glued {{to the sides of}} the sandal, which directs tension to less stressful areas of the sandal, which gives the sandals more durability.|$|R
60|$|The man {{did as he}} was bidden, and {{presently}} Little John {{opened his}} eyes and looked around him, all dazed and bewildered with the stun of the blow. Then they tied his hands behind him, and lifting him up set him upon the back of one of the horses, with his face to its tail and his <b>feet</b> <b>strapped</b> beneath its belly. So they took him back to the King's Head Inn, laughing and rejoicing as they went along. But in the meantime the widow's three sons had gotten safely away, and were hidden in the woodlands.|$|R
30|$|Measurement of {{bone mineral}} density (BMD) was {{performed}} at three sites: the lumbar spine, left wrist, and left hip. At the lumbar spine (LS), the patient lies supine on the imaging {{table and the}} legs are raised by support for the lower legs. At the left femur (LF), the patient lies supine on the imaging table where the legs are flat with <b>feet</b> <b>strapped</b> to a <b>feet</b> holder that position the measured leg at 300 inward rotation. At the left radius (LR), the patient sits beside the imaging table, with the arm positioned on the imaging table supported with a positioning device (Van der Sluis et al. 2002).|$|R
50|$|Stirrup {{pants were}} first worn as {{breeches}} for horse riders. The {{purpose of the}} strap under the foot was to hold the pant legs {{in place in the}} boots of the rider. As ladies moved away from riding sidesaddle, they began wearing riding breeches in the 1920s in a similar style to those worn by men. By 1934, Jodhpurs as riding pants with <b>foot</b> <b>straps</b> were being advertised in the United States mail order catalogue for Sears. Horse riding breeches are still made with an elastic foot strap in some designs. Stirrup pants for skiing were introduced at the 1936 Winter Olympic Games in Germany.|$|E
5000|$|Skurfing is a {{sport that}} has many origins but {{is said to be}} created in Australia and New Zealand with bindingless hand-shaped boards {{designed}} specifically for towing A 'skurf board' was lent to Jeff Darby and friends in Queensland, Australia, who started to make their own and who later came in contact with Tony Finn who was to later produce their brand 'Skurfer' under royalty. On {{the other side of the}} world in 1983, Howard Jacobs created several wakeboards by mounting windsurfing <b>foot</b> <b>straps</b> and partial hydroslide pads on some smaller surfboards that he had shaped; by 1984, he was throwing backflips on the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida.|$|E
5000|$|Kiteboard, a small composite, wooden, or foam board. There are now {{several types}} of kiteboards: {{directional}} surf-style boards, wakeboard-style boards, hybrids which can go in either direction but are built to operate better in one of them, and skim-type boards. Some riders also use standard surfboards, or even long boards, although without <b>foot</b> <b>straps</b> much of the high-jump capability of a kite is lost. Twin tip boards are the easiest to learn on and {{are by far the}} most popular. The boards generally come with sandal-type footstraps that allow the rider to attach and detach from the board easily; this is required for doing board-off tricks and jumps. Bindings are used mainly by the wakestyle riders wishing to replicate wakeboarding tricks such as KGBs and other pop initiated tricks. Kiteboards come in shapes and sizes to suit the rider's skill level, riding style, wind and water conditions.|$|E
5000|$|A {{few years}} prior to Tony Finn and the [...] "Skurfer", Australian {{surfboard}} shaper and inventor Bruce McKee, along with associate Mitchell Ross launched in Australia, the world's first mass-produced plastic, roto-moulded construction [...] "kurfboard" [...] named the [...] "Mcski", later [...] "SSS" [...] skiboard and later [...] "Wake-snake". The board had adjustable rubber foot-straps, concave tunnel bottom and a keel fin. Two smaller side fins were later added for greater hold and more maneuverability. McKee and Ross also applied for and were granted two patents, one in 1984 for a basic adjustable binding system [...] {{and the other in}} 1985 for a patent for their adjustable plate type <b>foot</b> <b>strap</b> system.|$|R
5000|$|Modern roller {{coasters}} are constantly evolving {{to provide a}} variety of different experiences. More focus is being placed on the position of riders in relation to the overall experience. Traditionally, riders sit facing forward, but newer variations such as stand-up and flying models position the rider in different ways to change the experiences. A flying model, for example, is a suspended roller coaster where the riders lie facing forward and down with their chests and <b>feet</b> <b>strapped</b> in. Other ways of enhancing the experience involve removing the floor beneath passengers riding above the track, as featured in floorless {{roller coasters}}. Also new track elements - usually types of inversions - are often introduced to provide entirely new experiences.|$|R
5000|$|IRBs {{are made}} of rubber and consist of four {{inflatable}} tubes - two side tubes, a bow tube and a keelson tube. This specific feature coupled with the obvious {{fact that they are}} used in the water, has coined the term [...] "rubber duck" [...] or simply [...] "duck" [...] to describe an IRB. Typically the rubber is coloured a shade of red termed 'Rescue Red' although a particular make of craft manufactured by Arancia come in a shade of orange.They have a rigid floor piece and a rigid transom for fitting an outboard motor (usually 25 hp).This motor is capable of providing a maximum drive speed of between 25-30 knots on flat water. 2-Stroke fuel is stored in a flexible fuel bladder and is secured by 4 clips to the floor in the bow. An IRB is crewed by two people - an IRB Operator/Driver and an IRB Crewman. The Operator sits on {{the lower half of the}} port side pontoon where he operates the outboard motor to control the boat. He has a single <b>foot</b> <b>strap</b> to help him stay in the boat. His left hand can hold on to a strap on the port side pontoon and his right hand operates the outboard motor by means of a tiller arm and throttle. The Crewman sits on the upper half of the starboard side pontoon. A handle is attached by a rope to the nose of the boat for him to hold with his left hand, while his right hand may hold a strap attached to the starboard pontoon. He balances the boat and allows it to go over large waves before they break without flipping. He also assists when going through a breaking wave, commonly referred to as [...] "punching-through". As of 2011 only one <b>foot</b> <b>strap</b> is available for a crew member.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{total of}} four seats on the {{lifeboat}} but the boat is capable of carrying over twenty people if necessary. At the heart of the lifeboat there is a console which houses the helmsman’s controls. This console also houses the illuminated compass, depth sounder, and various switches for controlling navigation lights. The engine start and stop switching is also located there along with individual tachometers motor high temperature warning lights. Behind the console is the seating for the crew, with the helmsman at the front, radio operator behind him to the port side, navigator to starboard and the fourth man's seat behind them. To secure the crew, each seat has <b>foot</b> <b>straps</b> fitted to the deck. The lifeboats water-tight VHF radio, loudspeaker system and hand-held microphone is located on the portside just behind the helmsmen position, although this can all be operated by a built-in radio speaker in the helmsman’s helmet. The lifeboat also has a Global Positioning System and radar control to a display screen. The system provides the lifeboat crew with co-ordinates, estimated speed, and guidance to programmable waypoints. The Oddfellows also has DF radio which will indicate the compass heading that a radio contact is coming from.|$|E
30|$|Besides {{the motor}} disabilities, {{perceptive}} deficits {{should be kept}} in mind when cycling. Bikes for people with disabilities have to offer adequate stability which is provided by a tricycle configuration. Also adjustments, such as additional <b>foot</b> <b>straps</b> to fix the feet on the pedals are common. Moreover, E-bikes increasingly enter the market and trikes are also successfully adapted with electric motors.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Equipment used {{in sports}} {{is of great}} importance, {{especially}} when the equipment is {{in direct contact with}} the athlete or is important for safety. In the sport kitesurfing environmental factors and the equipment design are crucial for the comfort and safety. The participants ’ choice and opinion of equipment can show which factors are considered most important for the performance and to reduce risk for injury. This study has evaluated self-reported information from the participants about what equipment they use, comfort of the equipment and if the equipment has contributed to any injuries. The methods used were questionnaires (n= 206) and interviews (n= 17), which in combination allows to assess the problem both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results showed that supported leading edge kites are most frequently used, with a waist harness and <b>foot</b> <b>straps</b> to attach the feet. The choice of kite type was mainly based on the discipline of riding for the respondent. Some issues concerning comfort of riding and injury risk the respondents did relate to the design of harness and <b>foot</b> <b>straps.</b> The information from this study can be used for development strategies for industry manufacturers and for further studies in the area of equip-ment design and biomechanics...|$|E
50|$|Huaraches are an open type {{of outdoor}} footwear, {{consisting}} of a sole held to the wearer's <b>foot</b> by <b>straps</b> passing over the instep and around the ankle. The common understanding is that these sandals were a variant of traditional Mexican huaraches, the difference being in design and construction.|$|R
5000|$|Casting hobbles are {{the same}} as the above, but with another rope or strap {{attached}} to the other hind <b>foot.</b> When these <b>straps</b> or ropes are pulled up together, the horse will fall.|$|R
50|$|Not {{including}} the handle, {{it has a}} height of 20.5 centimetres and a maximum diameter of 11.6 centimetres. The spout of the vessel widens slightly from the concave neck. Features such as its trefoil mouth, truncated column neck, pear-shaped body, low disk-shaped <b>foot</b> and <b>strap</b> handle indicate a fairly advanced stage of development, on which account it should be dated to {{the second or third}} quarter of the seventh century, probably between 640 and 620.|$|R
30|$|Over {{the last}} three decades closed {{intramedullary}} nailing has become the gold standard technique for the treatment of femoral shaft fractures. Its value has been proven by a high union rate, low number of complications, and low invasiveness to the soft tissues around the femur. The procedure is still technically demanding, so modern intramedullary nails with their insertion instruments are increasingly surgeon and patient friendly. Between 1995 and 2007, over 400 patients with femoral fractures were treated in our department with various types of antegrade cannulated locked femoral nails, but until recently we did not recognize any femoral neck fracture (FNF) associated with this procedure. We position patients on a fracture table using <b>foot</b> <b>straps</b> to provide longitudinal traction. Countertraction is applied via a perineal post. We always use the piriform fossa for the nail entry site. Since 2005 we have followed two cases with unusual complications attributed, in our opinion, to technical errors during the end stage of the procedure—end cup placement. The two senior authors fully recollect the procedure due to technical intraoperative complications. In both cases Synthes universal femoral nails were used. Immediately postoperative X-rays did not reveal signs of FNF, but on first follow-up after two weeks both patients were symptomatic, and anteroposterior (ap) radiograms revealed misplaced end cups and FNF.|$|E

50|$|The first {{ice skates}} {{were made from}} leg bones of horse, ox or deer, and were {{attached}} to <b>feet</b> with leather <b>straps.</b> These skates required a pole with a sharp metal spike that was used for pushing the skater forward, unlike modern bladed skates.|$|R
40|$|Objective: This {{paper will}} analyze the {{distribution}} of windsurfing injuries and examine if there have been any changes {{in the pattern of}} windsurfing injuries over the last ten years. Design: A retrospective chart review of windsurfing injuries at Providence Hood Memorial Hospital Emergency Department. Two hundred and twenty charts were reviewed from April to September during years 1995 - 1998. Charts were reviewed for the following: type of injury, multiple injuries, date of date of occurrence, age, sex, cause of injury, and location of residence. Results: Two hundred and twenty two charts were reviewed involving windsurfing· 1998 had significantly more injuries than any other year. More windsurfers required medical attention during the months of July and August. The most common types of injuries were Lacerations (36 %), followed by contusions (21 %), and Fractures, (13. 5 %). Injured sailors ranged from ages 12 - 68 {{with a mean age of}} 35. Out of the injured sailors 19. 2 % were females and 80. 6 % males. Conclusions: Windsurfing injuries are relatively the same as they were ten years ago. The number of <b>Foot</b> <b>strap</b> injuries have decreased from 1995 - 1998. Head and neck injuries occur at the same frequency. Foot/ankle and knee injuries have decreased slightly...|$|R
5000|$|Hiking and {{trekking}} sandals {{are designed}} for hiking or trekking in hot and tropical climates, usually using robust rubber outsole, suitable for any terrain, and softer EVA or Super EVA foam insole. These sandals are usually shaped to support the arched contour of the <b>foot.</b> The <b>straps</b> are usually made of polyester or nylon webbing for quick drying after exposure to acid and to minimize perspiration. Also suitable for many other adventure sports and activities where quick drying and reduced perspiration is required, including rafting, traveling, paragliding, skydiving.|$|R

30|$|Voluntary {{activation}} (VA) during MVCs {{was estimated}} from the mechanical {{responses to a}} superimposed and a potentiated twitch as VA (%)[*]=[*](1 -Superimposed Twitch/Potentiated Twitch) × 100 (Merton 1954). All assessments were performed on the right leg, with the participants in a seated position with the ankle and the knee flexed at 90 ° and 100 °, and the <b>foot</b> securely <b>strapped</b> to a fixed custom-made dynamometric pedal. The torque was recorded over a 1  s of plateau along with the concomitant EMG activity. Each test was repeated three to six times (see details below) and data were averaged for analyses.|$|R
50|$|Crveni opanci (Red opanci): {{made out}} of half tanned oxhide and dyed red by soaking the piece of skin in hot water with alder or birch bark, then the skin was shaped on a last, and a woven front made of strips of leather and tied to the <b>foot</b> with <b>straps</b> of leather. These were adopted from Bosnia in the mid-19th century and were worn {{throughout}} western and northern Serbia. Production was moved to workshops by 1900 and tanned leather was used. From 1870 onwards red opanci called donaši or Šabački opanci were most commonly worn.|$|R
50|$|Gaiters are {{a type of}} {{protective}} clothing for a person's ankles and legs below the knee. Gaiters are worn when walking, hiking, running (especially orienteering and rogaining) outdoors amongst dense underbrush or in snow, with or without snowshoes. Heavy gaiters are often worn when using crampons, to protect the leg and ankle from the spikes of the opposite <b>foot.</b> Gaiters <b>strap</b> over the hiking boot and around the person's leg to provide protection from branches and thorns and to prevent mud, snow, etc. from entering {{the top of the}} boot. Gaiters may also be worn as protection against snake bites.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>strap</b> <b>footing</b> is a {{component}} of a building’s foundation. It {{is a type of}} combined footing, [...] consisting of two or more column footings connected by a concrete beam. This type of beam is called a strap beam. It is used to help distribute the weight of either heavily or eccentrically loaded column footings to adjacent footings.|$|R
50|$|Sandals are an open type of footwear, {{consisting}} of a sole held to the wearer's <b>foot</b> by <b>straps</b> going over the instep and, sometimes, around the ankle. Sandals can also have a heel. While the distinction between sandals {{and other types of}} footwear can sometimes be blurry (as in the case of huaraches—the woven leather footwear seen in Mexico, and peep-toe pumps), the common understanding is that a sandal leaves most of the foot exposed. People may choose to wear sandals for several reasons, among them comfort in warm weather, economy (sandals tend to require less material than shoes and are usually easier to construct), and as a fashion choice.|$|R
