Using a simple model of a competitive labour market, I show how this correlation can emerge {{as a result of the}} common dependence of both quantities on the strength of enforcement of <b>fiscal</b> <b>regulation.</b> This suggests that a high spike in the wage distribution at the minimum wage level is, in some contexts, an issue of fiscal enforcement, more than a labour market issue. minimum wage, spike, underreporting, lighthouse effect...|$|R
30|$|From a {{modelling}} perspective, it {{is worth}} noticing how, in a standard competitive labour market, {{there should be no}} spike at the minimum wage level, as “workers whose services are worth less than the minimum wage are discharged” (Stigler 1946), and the wage distribution should be truncated. In other models, a spike could appear because, for instance, of adjustments in working conditions (De Fraja 1999) or training (Acemoglu and Pischke 2003), or because of frictions in the labour market (Manning 2003; Flinn 2006). This paper provides support for a different mechanism explaining the presence of a spike even in a competitive labour market, based {{on the role of the}} minimum wage in the enforcement of <b>fiscal</b> <b>regulation.</b>|$|R
40|$|Romania's {{accession}} to the European Union required {{a series of}} changes in the fiscal legislation in order to harmonize it with the Community Regulations; the value-added tax, the new introduced concepts or mechanism being especially regarded at this indirect tax level, with the function to accelerate the implementation of the European Directives. The changes made have a partial influence on how the fiscal liabilities are reflected in accounting, the latter representing in the same time a privileged source of information for the fiscal bodies. We shall present in this paper the implications of taxation on accounting, dwelling on the simplification measures provided for in Law no. 571 / 2003 concerning the Fiscal Code (Article 160), the reverse charge and self-liquidation of the value-added tax.

30|$|In this paper, I have {{highlighted}} {{the fact that}} the minimum wage affects compliance with <b>fiscal</b> <b>regulation</b> and has therefore a potential role in enforcement. What are the implications for minimum wage policy? A first thing to notice is that, in contexts where underreporting is pervasive, it would be incorrect to argue that a high proportion of the workforce earning the minimum wage is an indicator of the minimum wage being particularly binding from a labour market perspective. Thus, somebody calling for a reduction in the minimum wage, for instance because there is high unemployment in the economy, and claiming that a high spike indicates that the minimum wage is indeed too high given the productivity distribution, may be quite off the mark in a country where envelope wages are common.|$|R

The degree to which an intervention involves individual agency versus structural change influences socioeconomic inequalities in weight.

Many obesity prevention interventions belong to the agento-structural types of interventions, and account for {{the environment in which}} health behaviors occur, but they require a level of individual agency for behavioral change, including workplace design to encourage exercise and <b>fiscal</b> <b>regulation</b> of unhealthy foods or beverages.

40|$|In this paper, {{the costs}} and {{benefits}} associated with postponing retirement are simulated in a standard simulation model for Belgium, using the approach of Stock and Wise (1990). Unlike earlier microsimulation-based applications of this approach, such as Gruber and Wise (1999, 2004), this model does not take a representative sample as the point of departure, but simulates {{the costs and}} benefits of postponing retirement for four fictitious employees, representing male and female white- and blue-collar workers. While confirming conclusions drawn by other authors, this model allows for the separation of specific retirement schemes, and of the effect of different fiscal regimes for those retired and working. It is shown that differences between retirement schemes show up in differences in replacement rates and by whether or not the retirement benefit is a function of career length. Furthermore, advantageous <b>fiscal</b> <b>regulations</b> for the retired have a strong impact on the implicit costs of postponing retirement. option value; peak value; pension schemes; replacement rates...|$|E

Governments in Europe and {{elsewhere}} have renewed {{their attention to}} the <b>fiscal</b> <b>regulation</b> of their economies in order to close tax loopholes and boost revenues in response to the financial crisis. The article uses a neo-Polanyian ‘instituted economic process’ approach to explore and explain the uniquely high level of bogus self-employment in the UK construction industry, facilitated by confused law and stimulated by a bespoke construction fiscal regime, resulting in endemic tax evasion. It examines how the co-evolution of employment status law and a sector-specific fiscal regime maps tightly onto the emergence of mass self-employment, as evidenced by comparative labour market and sectoral statistics. Seeing competition as an instituted process within these distinctive market arrangements, it identifies a form of ‘degenerative competition’, driving out both genuine direct-employment and self-employment, and driving in bogus self-employment, with its attendant substantial fiscal losses, failed skill reproduction and poor productivity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{analyses}} {{the distinctive}} features of <b>fiscal</b> <b>regulation</b> of Ukrainian {{economy as a}} crucial factor of ensuring national security.

The most important obstacles of such sort are formation of rentier economy and counterproductive rent-seeking behavior of economic actors. The study of this phenomenon and of their influence on the efficiency of fiscal policy instruments in national economy made it possible to suggest a number of practical recommendations.
