40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the development of}} a fully continuous, hydraulics-based variable valve <b>timing</b> <b>system.</b> This hydraulics based variable valve <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> is capable of controlling an engine valves lift height and infinitely varying the engine valves lift profile. Along with full valve controllability during normal operation, the variable valve <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> is capable of providing the same operation as a classic cam shaft under engine power loss conditions. This is possible due to the rotating hydraulic spool valves coupled to the engines crank shaft, which are used to actuate the engine poppet valves. The main focus of this thesis is to investigate, alter and implement a new iteration of the <b>hydraulic</b> variable valve <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> on a standalone test bench to validate the systems operating principles. The test bench utilizes servo motors to act as an engines crank shaft which runs the rotating hydraulic spool valves and hydraulic pump. This serves as an intermediate step to full engine implementation of the variable valve <b>timing</b> <b>system.</b> The research begins by analyzing the current mechanical spool valve and hydraulic cylinder design for any potential problems that may occur either during assembly or full operation. The basic system equations are presented to give a glimpse into the working principles of the rotary valves. The mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic subsystems are discussed in terms of what was considered during the design and implementation process. Then design changes that were performed on the rotary valve system to overcome any failures. Lastly the resulting data is presented from the current variable valve timing design to verify proper system functionality...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{navigation}} accuracy of the X-ray pulsar navigation system, {{in this paper we}} propose a constant fraction timing method based on the low-pass filter to measure the arrival time of the X-ray pulse in X-ray pulsar navigation. According to the technical scheme, the timing accuracies and dead times of original peaking timing and the improved constant fraction timing are measured. Experimental results indicate that the timing accuracy and the dead time of the peaking <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> are 18 ns and 4750 ns, the timing accuracy and the dead time of the constant fraction <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> are 0. 78 ns and 105 ns. The timing accuracy and the dead time of constant fraction <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> are significantly improved compared with those of the peaking <b>timing</b> <b>system.</b> In the X-ray pulsar navigation system, the cumulative pulse profile of the X-ray pulse is constructed in the two different <b>timing</b> <b>systems</b> through measuring the arrival time of the X-ray photon. Experimental results indicate that compared with using the peaking <b>timing</b> <b>system,</b> the cumulative pulse profile of the X-ray pulse using the improved constant fraction <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> is improved obviously, therefore, the navigation accuracy could be improved by using the constant fraction <b>timing</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

The task of <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> is {{countdown}} on a {{set date}} and showing the time from current date to the setting date to enhance people’s attention and sense of urgency. A kind of high-precision <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> is introduced. The system is controlled by single-chip microcontroller. High integration clock chip is used as clock module. System hardware design and software design are introduced. System hardware design includes design of clock module, its connection with single-chip microcomputer, and the design of display module. System software design includes the settings of single-chip serial port, its initialization, the reading and writing of the clock module, the countdown program and the display program. Compared with other <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> which consists of frequency demultiplication by multivibrator, this system is more stable and reliable. The accumulative error is zero when long-time running continuously. Because the system control module is simple, it is convenient to be developed and utilized.

40|$|Levels of {{numerous}} hormones vary across {{the day and}} night. Such fluctuations are not only attributable to changes in sleep/wakefulness and other behaviors but also to a circadian <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> governed by the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. Sleep has a strong effect on levels of some hormones such as growth hormone but little effect on others which are more strongly regulated by the circadian <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> (e. g., melatonin). Whereas the exact mechanisms through which sleep affects circulating hormonal levels are poorly understood, more is known about how the circadian <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> influences the secretion of hormones. The suprachiasmatic nucleus exerts its influence on hormones via neuronal and humoral signals but it is now also apparent that peripheral tissues contain circadian clock proteins, {{similar to those in}} the suprachiasmatic nucleus, that are also involved in hormone regulation. Under normal circumstances, behaviors and the circadian <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> are synchronized with an optimal phase relationship and consequently hormonal systems are exquisitely regulated. However, many individuals (e. g., shift-workers) frequently and/or chronically undergo circadian misalignment by desynchronizing their sleep/wake and fasting/feeding cycle from the circadian <b>timing</b> <b>system.</b> Recent experiments indicate that circadian misalignment has an adverse effect on metabolic and hormonal factors such as circulating glucose and insulin. Further {{research is needed to determine}} the underlying mechanisms that cause the negative effects induced by circadian misalignment. Such research could aid the development of novel countermeasures for circadian misalignment...|$|R

40|$|There are two {{hypotheses}} {{to explain}} whether temporal processing {{was controlled by}} specific <b>timing</b> <b>system.</b> Recent studies show that dedicated <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> existed to control temporal processing according to dedicated <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> theory, while non-dedicated <b>timing</b> <b>system</b> theory suggests temporal processing can be implemented by analyzing other cognition activities {{from the viewpoint of}} cognition. The cognitive models such as ICM, TIP, AGM, RAM, DKM etc. support the former hypothesis, while SSM, CSM, CCM, MSDM support the latter. However, from the viewpoint of neural, two general frameworks have been articulated to describe how the passage of time is perceived. One emphasizes that the judgment of the duration of a stimulus depends on the operation of dedicated neural mechanisms specialized for representing the temporal relationships between events. Alternatively, the representation of duration could be ubiquitous, arising from the intrinsic dynamics of nondedicated neural mechanisms. In such models, duration might be coded directly through the amount of activation of sensory processes or as spatial patterns of activity in a network of neurons. The neural models such as STM and DNTM support the former, while SDN and ERM support the latter. Further study should discuss the relative issues more macroscopically...|$|R
