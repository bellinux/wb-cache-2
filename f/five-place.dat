5|$|Following an {{unscheduled}} gearbox change made {{ahead of}} the race weekend, Sebastian Vettel received a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty for the race.|$|E
5|$|After {{causing a}} {{collision}} with Bruno Senna in Spain, Schumacher received a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty for the Monaco Grand Prix. Schumacher was fastest in qualifying in Monaco; but started sixth owing to his penalty. He later retired from seventh place in the race.|$|E
5|$|Max Verstappen {{received}} a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty for the Canadian Grand Prix after causing {{a collision with}} Romain Grosjean in Monaco. During the final practice session, Toro Rosso had to equip his car with the fifth internal combustion engine of the season. As he exceeded the limit of four units per power unit element per season, he {{received a}}n additional ten-place grid penalty.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel {{was handed}} a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty for {{overtaking}} Manor's Roberto Merhi under red flags {{during the third}} free practice session. After Max Verstappen qualified twelfth for the race, {{he was unable to}} be placed the full fifteen places back on the grid from both his penalties. As grid penalties were no longer carried over to subsequent races in 2015, he was instead handed a ten-second penalty, to be served with his first pit stop during the race.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007–08 season, West Ham {{remained}} reasonably consistently in the {{top half}} of the league table, with Fredrik Ljungberg in the team, despite a slew of injuries; new signing Craig Bellamy missed most of the campaign, while Kieron Dyer was out from August 2007. The last game of the season, at the Boleyn Ground, saw West Ham draw 2–2 against Aston Villa, ensuring a tenth-place finish three points ahead of rivals Tottenham Hotspur. It was a <b>five-place</b> improvement on the previous season, and most importantly West Ham were never under any realistic threat of relegation.|$|E
5|$|Since {{he did not}} post a {{lap time}} within 107% of the fastest time during Q1, Jenson Button was {{required}} {{to apply to the}} race stewards to be allowed to the start the race; they granted him permission to do so. After qualifying, McLaren had to fit his car with a fifth heat motor generator unit (MGU-H) and a fifth turbo charger for the season. As this exceeded the limit of four units per power unit element, Button was later handed ten-place and <b>five-place</b> grid penalties. As he was already due to start {{from the back of the}} grid, the penalty was substituted with a drive-through penalty, to be served within the first three laps of the race.|$|E
5|$|As Q3 started, Lewis Hamilton {{stopped in}} the pit lane {{with a loss of}} power and was pushed back into the garage. He was {{eventually}} able to go on track and qualified third, after starting several quick laps only to abandon them to leave his final run to the last moment. He was however beaten to pole position by Ricciardo, who was almost three-tenths of a second faster than second placed Rosberg, with Vettel following in fourth almost a second slower. Nico Hülkenberg managed fifth ahead of Kimi Räikkönen, who was to serve a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change, leaving him eleventh on the grid. Carlos Sainz Jr., Sergio Pérez, Daniil Kvyat and Fernando Alonso rounded up the top ten. Ricciardo's pole position was the first for a Renault-powered turbocharged car since Ayrton Senna's front-of-the-grid start at the 1986 Mexican Grand Prix for Lotus.|$|E
5|$|As Q3 started, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Lewis Hamilton would be unable to take part, suffering from a hybrid system failure in the turbo charger, the same problem that had plagued him in China two weeks earlier. Nico Rosberg went on to secure pole position, even though his last timed lap was compromised by a tyre lockup into turn 13. Sebastian Vettel was closest to Rosberg, but a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty meant that he would start the race from seventh on the grid, moving Valtteri Bottas into the first row. Kimi Räikkönen was fourth fastest, ahead of Massa, Ricciardo, Pérez, Kvyat and Verstappen. After qualifying, Mercedes decided to switch Hamilton's car back to his spare power unit, which had been rebuilt following its failure at the Chinese Grand Prix, thereby avoiding a grid penalty, which they would have incurred if a new power unit would have been installed. Williams were satisfied with their pace in qualifying, praising the advances they made in slow-corner speed.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the rain}} that had fallen, the drivers went out on track on {{intermediate}} tyres {{at the beginning of}} Q3. On these tyres, Hamilton set the fastest time, followed by Button and Ricciardo. The track dried quickly however, and soon the cars returned to the pit lane to switch to slick tyres. Hülkenberg twice set the fastest time, but was beaten to pole position by Hamilton. Rosberg went faster as well, but lost his second place on the grid to Hülkenberg due to his <b>five-place</b> grid penalty. Vettel went fourth fastest, but was relegated as well, handing third on the grid to Button, who had set the fifth fastest time. Räikkönen, Ricciardo, Valtteri Bottas, Verstappen and Felipe Massa rounded up the top ten. It was Hülkenberg's second front row start of his career, the first having been his pole position at the 2010 Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} {{consecutive}} race, the fastest driver in qualifying did not start the race from pole. Michael Schumacher set the fastest time, but a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty left him sixth overall. Two hours before the race, protests against parts introduced onto {{the floor of the}} Red Bull RB8 left team principal Christian Horner with a choice: to change the offending parts and start both cars from the pit lane, guaranteeing that any result the team recorded would be preserved; or to leave the parts on the car, allowing both drivers to start the race from the positions they qualified in, but risking a post-race exclusion. Horner ultimately chose the latter option, and Mark Webber started from pole, establishing an early lead over Nico Rosberg as a first-corner accident eliminated four cars. The race was run under the constant threat of rain, with drivers trying to extend the life of their tyres to avoid being forced to make an additional stop and falling down the order. The rain never materialised, though Jean-Éric Vergne was observed using a set of intermediate tyres late in the race. The variety of strategies used by the front-runners resulted in the last ten laps being contested with the top six cars running nose-to-tail. Webber visibly faded in the final laps, but held on when the following cars were momentarily pinned behind the slow-moving Heikki Kovalainen. Webber won the race – his second on the streets of Monaco – with Rosberg second and Fernando Alonso third, the result giving Alonso a three-point lead in the championship. Red Bull Racing maintained their lead in the Constructors' Championship as rival teams chose not to follow through on the threat of their pre-race protest, while Kovalainen finished thirteenth to see Caterham overtake Marussia for tenth place. Elsewhere, Spanish Grand Prix winner Pastor Maldonado was given a ten-place grid penalty for an incident that saw him clip Sergio Pérez. Combined with a <b>five-place</b> penalty for changing his gearbox, Maldonado started from the back row of the grid where he was eliminated in the first-corner accident.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} session on Saturday, Sebastian Vettel set the fastest time, at 1:07.098, {{a little over}} a tenth of a second ahead of his {{teammate}} Räikkönen. Rosberg had the slowest time of the session, as he crashed out when his suspension broke after going over the kerbs at turn 2. His accident caused a ten-minute red flag period. His teammate Hamilton was third fastest, albeit running wide at turn 8 on one of his laps. Ricciardo was fourth fastest, half a second down on Vettel and one tenth of a second ahead of teammate Verstappen in fifth. Fernando Alonso, who lost parts of his bodywork when running over the kerbs late in the session, was tenth fastest, 1.2 seconds behind Vettel. Due to his crash, Mercedes had to change the gearbox on Rosberg's car, handing him a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty.|$|E
5|$|In third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, Hamilton narrowly beat Rosberg to the fastest time, lapping just 0.068 seconds faster than his teammate. All drivers used the super-soft tyre compound {{to set their}} fastest lap times, with the two Ferrari cars of Vettel and Räikkönen third and fourth ahead of the Williams pair of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas. Vettel {{had spent most of}} the session testing his car with a heavier fuel load in preparation for the race that would see him start with a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty for a change of the gearbox. He completed the highest number of laps with 28, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo, who was 11th fastest. At the back end, the Sauber drivers of Ericsson and Nasr were slowest, behind both Manor cars.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{made it a}} clean {{sweep of}} fastest times in {{practice}} on Saturday morning, setting a time of 1:30.904, again less than {{a tenth of a}} second ahead of Rosberg. The session started in wet conditions following a rain shower thirty minutes before it commenced. It was interrupted with 22 minutes to go, after Marcus Ericsson crashed heavily at the exit of Stowe corner. With the car cleared from the track, lengthy repair work at the barriers followed, leaving just five minutes of running when practice was restarted. The drivers then set their fastest times of the session. Again, it were the Red Bull drivers closest to the Mercedes, with Ricciardo ahead of Verstappen in third, both about half a second off Hamilton's time. Ericsson was sent to hospital for tests following his accident and received a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty since his gearbox had to be changed. Vettel received the same penalty after his gearbox failed {{towards the end of the}} third practice session.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), only the Ferrari were confident enough to run only on the slower, harder tyres, {{while the rest of the}} field needed to equip the super-soft compound. Daniil Kvyat topped the session with a time of 1:45.340 on the supersoft tyre. Pastor Maldonado was eliminated, as were the two Manor Marussia drivers, who were even further off the pace than usual. Both of the team's drivers received a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty for a gearbox change. Both Sauber drivers also did not make it into Q2, when Jenson Button was the last to set a fast lap, edging out Felipe Nasr by less than a tenth of a second.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher was {{the fastest}} driver not {{to advance to}} the final session, {{qualifying}} eleventh; his best time of 1:15.026 was nearly two seconds slower than Alonso's fastest time in the second session. He had been one tenth of a second quicker than his teammate Rosberg in the first session; Rosberg's lap caused Schumacher to be eliminated from qualifying and the latter stated he had brake problems. Kamui Kobayashi qualified in 12th after he encountered slower cars which forced him to reduce his speed, and his tyre temperatures dropped which resulted in a loss of grip. He was followed by Petrov in the 13th position. Sutil was afflicted with a lack of grip in his Force India which caused him to slide sideways. However Sutil was penalised five positions because this team changed his gearbox following his driveshaft failure in the final practice session. As a result, de la Rosa inherited 14th, and was ahead of the Toro Rosso drivers (Jaime Alguersuari in front of Buemi). Jarno Trulli was the quickest driver who was unable to advance beyond the first part of qualifying, and was followed by his Lotus teammate Heikki Kovalainen. Timo Glock was penalised five positions on the grid twice because his team changed his gearbox and fitted a seventh-gear ratio that went undeclared on Friday. Senna took over the 20th place. Liuzzi exited turn 15 to complete his second timed lap, ran over a wet patch of astroturf causing him to lose control of the back-end of his Force India, sending him across the track to make heavy contact with the front of his car. He veered back towards the track and some grass and narrowly avoided collecting Glock. Sakon Yamamoto had a shifting issue on his fastest lap time and took 23rd. Lucas di Grassi had a gearbox problem in his car that was unable to be rectified and completed the field. He was later given a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty for the gearbox change but it had no effect on his starting position.|$|E
5|$|Despite its troubled {{construction}} period, the Circuit of the Americas {{passed its}} final FIA inspection on 25 September, allowing {{the race to}} go ahead. Sebastian Vettel took his sixth pole position of the season, whilst Alonso struggled throughout qualifying to start the race ninth, which became eighth when Romain Grosjean received a grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change. Amid concerns that drivers starting from even-numbered grid slots would suffer {{from a lack of}} grip as they were located off the racing line, Ferrari deliberately broke the seal on Felipe Massa's gearbox, thereby giving him a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty and promoting Alonso to seventh and the clean side of the grid. Ferrari's fears were not without merit as the drivers starting from even-number spaces fell behind {{at the start of the}} race. Vettel quickly converted pole position into a steady race lead as Lewis Hamilton fought to regain second place from Mark Webber. Moments after Hamilton caught him on lap 17, the Australian suffered yet another alternator problem, and coasted to a halt. Red Bull Racing team principal Christian Horner later admitted that the team's perpetual alternator problems were a serious concern with just one race left in the championship, a World Championship at stake and very little time to diagnose and correct the problem. With Webber now out of the running, Hamilton then turned his attentions on Vettel and steadily closed the gap to the lead, overtaking the World Championship leader on lap 42 when Vettel got caught behind Narain Karthikeyan in the meandering first sector, which allowed Hamilton to pass Vettel along the long back straight. Hamilton held onto the lead for the final fourteen laps, but with Vettel never more than a second and a half behind him, Hamilton could not afford to relax, and he won the race by just six-tenths of a second. Alonso recovered from seventh to finish third – marking the first time that he, Hamilton and Vettel had stood on the podium together in the one hundred races all three had contested together – and forcing the title fight to extend to the final round in Brazil. Further down the order, Massa overcame his gearbox penalty to finish fourth, while Jenson Button fell from twelfth on the grid to sixteenth at the end of the first lap, using an alternative strategy to claw his way back up to fifth. Michael Schumacher, on the other hand, went backwards; after qualifying fifth, his Mercedes chewed through its tyres, forcing him to make a second stop that sent him plummeting down the order to finish sixteenth, and a clutch problem during his stop deprived Kimi Räikkönen of the chance to compete with Alonso for the final podium place. Both Marussia drivers out-qualified the Caterhams for the first time, only for Timo Glock and Charles Pic be out-raced by Heikki Kovalainen and Vitaly Petrov, but the Russian team held onto tenth place in the World Constructors' Championship. Despite losing Webber to an alternator failure, Red Bull collected enough points to secure their third consecutive World Constructors' Championship title.|$|E
25|$|The Diamond DA50 Super Star and DA50 Magnum are Austrian <b>five-place</b> {{single-engine}} {{composite aircraft}} designed by Diamond Aircraft Industries. Introduced in 2006, {{the project was}} later put on hold until the turboprop JP7 variant was introduced in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Fabiani had again {{failed to}} get within 107% of the fastest Q1 time but {{was not allowed to}} start the races after an altercation with the {{stewards}} as well as having incurred a number of other penalties already. Oriola required an engine change and would therefore take a <b>five–place</b> grid drop in race one while Arai failed to report to scrutineering during Q1 so his qualifying times were removed.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session was}} split into three parts. The {{first part of}} qualifying runs for 20minutes and eliminates the cars that finished the session 17th or lower. The second part of qualifying lasts for 15minutes and eliminates cars that finished in positions 11 to 16. The final part of qualifying determines the positions from first to tenth, and decides who starts the Grand Prix in pole position. Hamilton clinched his seventh career pole position of his career, {{with a time of}} 1:26.714 in the third session. He was joined on the front-row by Kubica, who was a tenth of a second behind Hamilton. Kovalainen was third, with Massa fourth, four-tenths slower than Hamilton in the third part. In contrast to Massa's fourth place, his teammate, Räikkönen finished qualifying in 16th place. His Ferrari car suffered a fuel pump problem at the end of part one, with the Ferrari team unable to fix the problem before the second session. Räikkönen was not the only driver to suffer problems. Webber in the Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel in the Toro Rosso also suffered problems, with Webber spinning off in session two due to brake failure, leaving him down in 15th. Vettel was scheduled to be in the third session, but his Toro Rosso suffered oil pump failure, preventing him from setting a time in the session. Heidfeld, Trulli, Rosberg and Coulthard completed the top eight positions. Timo Glock in a Toyota finished qualifying in ninth position, however, he was demoted to 19th after being given two <b>five-place</b> grid penalties. His first <b>five-place</b> penalty was a result of a gearbox change, while his second <b>five-place</b> penalty was for impeding Webber during the session.|$|E
25|$|In Malaysia, Räikkönen {{topped the}} time sheet {{in the second}} {{practice}} session. Räikkönen was ninth in qualifying. Sebastian Vettel and Rubens Barrichello's ten and <b>five-place</b> penalties respectively meant that {{he was promoted to}} 7th. During the race, rain was predicted and the team took a gamble to change Räikkönen to full wet tyres while the track was still dry. The gamble did not pay off, and Räikkönen fell down the field. By the time the race was stopped on the 33rd lap due to torrential rain, Räikkönen was classified 14th.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} that such a penalty relegated a driver past the back row of the grid, the {{remaining}} penalty carried over to the next race. For example, if a driver qualified in nineteenth position and received a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty, they dropped to twenty-second and last place for that race, and then would receive an additional two-place penalty in the next Grand Prix. These penalties could only be carried over to the next race, rather than accumulate, and only applied to penalties issued for going over the component quota. Penalties cannot be carried over from season to season; when a driver incurred such a penalty during the final race of the season, the stewards {{had the power to}} issue time penalties during the race.|$|E
25|$|Drivers {{were only}} able to use five engines {{over the course of}} a season in 2014, down from eight in 2013. Drivers who used a sixth engine started the race from the pit lane, as opposed to the ten-place grid penalty handed down for going over the engine quota in {{previous}} season. Drivers were {{only able to}} use five individual components of each power unit element over the course of the season. If a driver went over this quota for any individual element, they incurred a ten-place grid penalty. They would receive a further <b>five-place</b> penalty for going over the five-unit allocation of any other element after the original ten-place penalty was applied in a bid to stop teams changing multiple elements of the engine unit after receiving a grid penalty.|$|E
25|$|At the Australian Grand Prix, {{the cars}} again {{occupied}} {{the back row}} of the grid, with Senna ahead of Chandhok. The F110s were both 6.6 seconds off the polesitter's time, but only 0.34 seconds behind the Virgin of Lucas di Grassi. Senna's car only lasted four laps of the race before retiring with a hydraulic failure, but Chandhok finished 14th and last for the car's first classified finish, albeit five laps adrift of the winner and three laps behind Heikki Kovalainen's 13th-placed Lotus. This was partly due to a damaged floor caused by Chandhok coming off the track twice during the race. In Malaysia, Chandhok achieved the F110's best qualifying position without grid rearrangement in 22nd position. In the race both cars ran efficiently and achieved the F110's first double-finish, with Chandhok and Senna finishing in 15th and 16th positions respectively, ahead of the two delayed Lotus drivers. Chandhok finished three laps down, while Senna was another lap behind the leader. At the Chinese Grand Prix, Chandhok received a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty as the team broke the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) seal on his car's gearbox without {{a representative of the}} governing body being present; he was then further penalised for his mechanics changing a hydraulic pump assembly with parts of a different specification to the originals, and was made to start from the pit lane. In the race, the F110 achieved another double finish, with Senna leading Chandhok home in 16th and 17th positions respectively.|$|E
25|$|Button {{qualified}} in seventh, {{but took}} a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty {{for changing the}} gearbox in his McLaren. As a result his teammate Magnussen moved into seventh. Despite improving his car's balance, Räikkönen slid several times after a front-end problem could not be rectified, creating understeer, and was restricted to starting eighth. Sutil took ninth and Maldonado, who was the fastest driver not to advance into the final part of qualifying, rounded out the top ten, but slid in turn 19, losing about two-tenths of a second, preventing him from bettering his time. Pérez used two set of super-soft tyres in the first session to ensure he made {{the second part of}} qualifying and took 11th. Hülkenberg was forecast to qualify in the top ten until a tear-off visor wrapped itself around one of his front tyres entering turn 12. He had no grip, ran wide, and lost time, restricting him to qualifying 13th. Kvyat complained of tyre temperature issues after being delayed by slower traffic on his out-lap and could only muster 14th. However, he was handed a ten-place grid penalty for changing an engine component. His teammate Vergne moved into his former starting position and was the fastest driver not to enter the second session by five hundredths of a seconds. Vergne attributed this to changing to an old less powerful engine and excessive oversteer. Esteban Gutiérrez lined up in 15th ahead of Grosjean. Vettel opted to do one lap on soft compound tyres to comply with the 107% rule and took 17th. He started from the pit lane after changing his engine, his sixth of the season.|$|E
25|$|Ricciardo {{qualified}} in third, and {{was unable}} to improve on his fastest time after sliding on his final timed lap. His teammate Vettel could not use his energy recovery system {{in the first part of}} qualifying; he ran in a different mode and the yellow flags meant he was restricted to fourth. The two Ferrari cars of Alonso and Räikkönen were fifth and sixth; both had tyre warming problems. Despite his final lap being affected by the yellow flags, Vergne took seventh and his teammate Kvyat secured ninth after struggling with rear-end control and hit the barriers lining the circuit. He drove to the pit lane for a replacement nose cone. They were separated by Magnussen in eighth and Pérez rounded out the top ten after locking his tyres driving into the Novelle chicane. Hülkenberg was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session; his best lap time of one minute and 17.846 second was nearly two seconds slower than Hamilton's pace in the second session. Button was delayed by a Toro Rosso on his final lap at the Swimming Pool complex and was restricted to 12th. Bottas had front tyre heating problems and was only able to qualify 13th. Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado in the two Lotus cars took 14th and 15th with Massa unable to record a lap time. Ericsson locked his rear tyres going into Mirabeau corner and glanced Massa's car heading into the turn, causing both drivers to hit the barriers. The stewards investigated the incident and Ericsson was handed two penalty points on his super licence and was required to start from the pit lane. Gutiérrez failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, and was followed by Sauber teammate Adrian Sutil. Jules Bianchi lost half a second because of slower traffic and yellow flags and took 19th. He received a <b>five-place</b> grid penalty, because his team changed a problematic gearbox overnight. As a result, his Marussia teammate Chilton inherited 19th. Kamui Kobayashi used super soft compound tyres on his first two timed laps and made a front wing adjustment but {{was unable to}} improve and qualified in 20th.|$|E
