Root mean square error (RMSE) differences of 0. 05 Mg C/ha between models on total SOC predictions suggest that for contractual purposes, SOC dynamics can be simulated by a two-pool structure with labile and stable components.

However, significant redistribution of copper with time was not detected in plots with a higher rate of copper application (19. 25 kg copper sulphate ha- 1). The change in distribution of copper at the lower copper application rates appeared to be only partly responsible for a corresponding decrease observed in EDTA-extractable soil copper during the trial.

Since 1960, results from fertilizer trials {{carried out in the}} plantation led to the conclusion that negative responses were linked to the native chlorine deficiency; correcting the deficiency with chloride increased the uptake of potassium, calcium and magnesium, whose contents increased in the trunk, petiole and rachis of the fronds. Only K leaflet content did not respond to fertilizer. Since 2009, measurements of rachis K content in a factorial <b>fertilizer</b> <b>trial</b> confirmed a positive trend with KCl applications.

40|$|In 1932, a {{nitrogen}} <b>fertilizer</b> <b>trial</b> {{was initiated}} on a loamy Oxyaquic Eutrochrept near Munich (Germany). After 45 years, the sodium nitrate plots showed {{a much stronger}} slaking of the soil surface compared to the calcium nitrate plots in 1976. Sampling of the experimental plots to 1 m depth {{in order to determine}} bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil moisture characteristic, slaking resistance and exchangeable cations was only possible after termination of the experiment in 1998. Comparison of the laboratory results of both plots showed increased contents of exchangeable Na, but no decrease of exchangeable Ca for the sodium nitrate plots. Bulk density at depths > 50 cm increased and the slaking resistance decreased on those plots. The other soil structural properties determined were not significantly affected. The reason behind these unexpected findings is the change from sodium nitrate to calcium nitrate + cattle salt as the sodium nitrate fertilizer in 1984, 15 years prior to sampling. The resulting additional supply of Ca 2 + was able to remediate the formerly visible deterioration of the soil structure by Na+. The adverse structural effects of an unfavourable fertilizer type (based on monovalent cations) can therefore be reversed by a change to a more appropriate type (based on bivalent cations, preferentially Ca 2 +) ...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increase}} in agricultural field trials in recent years, {{the question of the}} use of former sites of concluded experiments is becoming of ever increasing importance. It was the aim of the present study to define the possible methods by which areas which have been differentially treated in past experiments may be effectively utilized in new experiments and to determine the efficiency of the various methods. Methods of design were tested using the yields from a field which formed a portion of a rotation and fertilizer experiment conducted at the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station since 1915. The possible methods of design were grouped under two heads: (a) Those in which all the treatments in the new experiment could be planted on each of the original plots; and (b) those in which the block of the new experiment comprised a number of the original plots. Reduction of the error was attempted in two ways: (a) By the grouping together of plots from different parts of the field on the basis of equal fertility (as indicated by the previous yield) to form the block of the new trial; and (b) by the application of a covariance treatment to blocks formed by the grouping of adjacent plots, using the results of the original trial as concomitant information. The efficiency of the various methods in reducing the error variance was evaluated. It was shown that on the average equal fertility grouping was little better than adjacent plot grouping. The use of covariance on the adjacent plot grouping on the basis of one year 2 ̆ 7 s previous yield was twice as efficient as adjacent plot grouping alone. Multiple covariance on the basis of 2 previous years 2 ̆ 7 results was over three times as efficient in reducing the error variance. The relationship of these methods to the variable influences affecting the yield from year to year {{and the manner in which}} each did or did not utilize the available information are discussed. It was concluded that the most satisfactory method of design was to ignore the previous treatments and to form the blocks from adjacent plots in the normal manner. When the results come to hand at the end of the season the covariance adjustment should be used, supplying its own test as to its efficiency in reducing the error variance. An experiment designed so that each treatment was represented on each of the original plots was superimposed on the <b>fertilizer</b> <b>trial</b> during 1936. Three top-cross varieties of corn were tested at two rates of planting (three and four plants per hill) each of these six possible treatments being tested with normal planting as against spaced planting. The yields showed: (a) that the variety, Inbred 75 on Krug, gave the highest yields; (b) that under the dry seasonal conditions of 1936, the lower rate of planting gave the higher yield and (c) that spaced planting gave only. 7 of a bushel per acre greater yield than normal planting. The error variances, both in this trial and in the case where covariance adjustments were applied to adjacent plot grouping, were comparable with the errors obtained from experiments placed on normal uniform sites, and very small differences between treatments were shown to be significant. It was shown that in certain of the suggested designs it is impossible to separate the interaction of the new treatments with the differential fertility of the original plots from the error variance and therefore such interactions may play an important part in increasing the error. In cases such as the one studied, where a variety trial was superimposed on a <b>fertilizer</b> <b>trial,</b> it is evident that this interaction, though significant, will not increase the error variance unduly. It may frequently be desirable to continue the original <b>fertilizer</b> <b>trial</b> because of its 2 ̆ 2 permanent 2 ̆ 2 nature. The bearing of the various designs on this matter is discussed and it is shown that with certain designs, the validity of the comparison of the total yields of the original plots is not disturbed by the new treatments...|$|E

In the first experiment, plots were planted with Piper aduncum, Gliricidia sepium and Imperata cylindrica, which were slashed after one year, whereafter sweet potato was planted. Sweet potato yield was lowest after Gliricidia fallow, but no yield differences were found after piper and imperata fallow. In the second season, {{there was no significant}} difference in sweet potato yields. The second experiment consisted of a factorial <b>fertilizer</b> <b>trial</b> with four levels of N (0, 50, 100, 150 kg ha- 1) and two levels of K (0, 50 kg ha- 1). Nitrogen fertilizers increased yield in the first season, but depressed tuber yields in the second and third seasons. Potassium fertilizer had no effect on marketable tuber yield. The third experiment consisted of a comparison between N from inorganic fertilizer and poultry litter at four rates (0, 50, 100, 150 kg ha- 1).

In the <b>fertilizer</b> <b>trial,</b> soil C increased linearly from 2. 7 to 4. 2 %, {{and there was no}} difference in rates of increase in C between treatments, despite much greater aboveground production when P was added. This lack of difference was attributed to higher stocking rates on treatments with higher production, and to the possibility that root inputs (which differed less between treatments) was a more important control of soil C accumulation. Nitrogen (%) was lower in the unfertilized than fertilized treatments due to lower clover N fixation, which was constrained by P availability. Soil C (%) was significantly greater in the unirrigated treatment than the irrigated treatments throughout the trial. Aboveground production was much greater in the irrigated than dryland treatment but root biomass was lower. Irrigation must have increased C and N losses, possibly via increased respiration rates during seasonally dry periods.

AM symbiosis not only promotes plant growth through facilitation of nutrient uptake, but it might also protect the plant from abiotic and/or biotic stresses. The benefits received by the AM symbiosis vary depending on the host genotype and the AM fungus species. In nature, as well as in crop fields, different AM fungi can be present in the soil or the plant, and affected by P availability or plant genotype. This has been little documented in field-grown crops however. In this study, we examined AM colonization in roots of a panel of maize genotypes grown in soils with contrasted P levels. We examined the relative level of colonization by 5 different AM fungi. Field experiment was carried out at the long-term P <b>fertilizer</b> <b>trial</b> of INRA-Auzeville (SW France). The field consisted in 4 P levels replicated in 4 blocks, ranging from P-deprived soils (P 0, soil that had not been fertilized for 45 years), to soils that have been under excess P fertilization (P 4, 4 -fold the P offtake by crops). A total of 23 maize genotypes (selected for their contrasting root traits) grown in the two extreme P regimes (P 0 and P 4) were assessed. The level of root colonization was examined by microscopy observations of trypan-blue stained roots. AM colonization was further quantified by qPCR. Differences in susceptibility to AM colonization among the different maize genotypes grown under different P levels will be presented...|$|E
3000|$|Ionomics is {{the study}} of {{elemental}} accumulation in living organisms using high-throughput elemental profiling. In the present study, we examined the ionomic responses to nutrient deficiency in maize grown in the field in long-term <b>fertilizer</b> <b>trials.</b> Furthermore, the available elements in the field soils were analyzed to investigate their changes under long-term fertilizer treatment and the ionomic relationships between plant and soil. Maize was cultivated in a field with the following five long-term fertilizer treatments: complete fertilization, fertilization without nitrogen, without phosphorus, without potassium, and no fertilization. Concentrations of 22 elements in leaves at an early flowering stage and in soils after harvest were determined. The fertilizer treatments changed the availabilities of many elements in soils. For example, available cesium was decreased by 39  % and increased by 126  % by fertilizations without nitrogen and potassium, respectively. Effects of treatments on the ionome in leaves were evaluated using the translocation ratio (the concentration in leaves relative to the available concentration in soils) for each element. Nitrogen deficiency specifically increased the uptake ability of molybdenum, which [...]...|$|R
40|$|Is Africa {{ready for}} a 'Green Revolution'? In his recent book 'Indigenous Agricultural Revolution: Ecology and Food Production in West Africa', British {{anthropologist}} Paul Richards argues that it is. But, says Richards, it is the peasants themselves who best know their local environments. The author suggests that the way forward is to build on this foundation of local knowledge. As {{an example of the}} peasant enterprise on which researchers should build, Richards cites Mende farmers in Sierra Leone, who are developing their own new rice strains and carrying out their own field trials. Richards does not argue that science cannot help peasant systems. In recent UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) <b>fertilizer</b> <b>trials</b> in Nigeria, half the crops were grown under FAO's ''improved cultivation practices' and half using traditional crop-mixing. The peasant methods yielded far more than FAD's, but fertilizers increased the peasants' yields. The book overflows with examples of how the 'peoples' sciences' in West Africa are worth serious considerationbook 'Indigenous Agricultural Revolution: Ecology and Food Production in West Africa' / Paul Richard...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{multienvironment}} trials, {{the local}} spatial tendency within trials and the residual heterogeneity between trials can be jointly modeled {{in the context}} of mixed linear models. The objective {{of this study was to}} know the suitability of spatial models within trials and the residual heterogeneity between <b>trials</b> for multienvironment <b>fertilizer</b> <b>trials.</b> The research used field trials data of rice fertilization in Karawang and Kebumen region. Fertilizer treatments consist of fourteen levels of fertilizer type with three replications. In Kebumen region the research was conducted over two growing seasons. The experiment used a randomized complete block design. The results show that for single experiment the best model for Karawang and Kebumen 1 location was RCBCE power isotropic model, whilst for Kebumen 2 location was RCBCE power anisotropic model. In combined experiments the best model was CE power anisotropic model with heterogeneous residual variance across locations. Modeling of the local spatial tendencies using an analysis of variance including heterogeneous residual variances increased the ability to identify differences among treatments. Key-Words: randomized complete block design, multienvironment trials, local spatial, residual heterogeneity. 1...|$|R
